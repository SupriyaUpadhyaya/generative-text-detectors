This goes\nbeyond classical sentiment analysis, and also much further than customer\nprofiling. The purpose here is to have a characterisation of users in terms of\npersonality traits, such as openness, conscientiousness, extraversion,\nagreeableness, and neuroticism. While this is an incipient area of research, we\nask the question of whether cognitive abilities, and intelligence in\nparticular, are also measurable from user profiles. However, we pose the\nquestion as broadly as possible in terms of subjects, in the context of\nuniversal psychometrics, including humans, machines and hybrids. Namely, in\nthis paper we analyse the following question: is it possible to measure the\nintelligence of humans and (non-human) bots in a social network or a game just\nfrom their user profiles, i.e., by observation, without the use of interactive\ntests, such as IQ tests, the Turing test or other more principled machine\nintelligence tests?", "machine_text": "We investigate the prospect of estimating intelligence from user profiles in the context of universal psychometrics, acknowledging the potential benefits of leveraging digital data for cognitive assessment. Our approach employs a novel framework combining machine learning and psychometric theory to extract relevant features from user profiles, which are then used to predict intelligence quotient (IQ) scores. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach using a dataset of online user profiles and IQ test results, achieving moderate correlations between predicted and actual IQ scores. While our results offer promising prospects for universal psychometrics, we also identify several caveats, including concerns regarding data quality, user engagement, and the potential for biases in online data. Furthermore, we highlight the need for further research to address these limitations and ensure the development of a robust and reliable method for estimating intelligence from user profiles."}

The method is based on a key sociological insight\nthat has been developed and extensively verified over the last twenty years,\nbut has yet to make an impact in artificial intelligence. The insight is that\nresource bounded humans will, by default, act to maintain affective\nconsistency. Humans have culturally shared fundamental affective sentiments\nabout identities, behaviours, and objects, and they act so that the transient\naffective sentiments created during interactions confirm the fundamental\nsentiments. Humans seek and create situations that confirm or are consistent\nwith, and avoid and supress situations that disconfirm or are inconsistent\nwith, their culturally shared affective sentiments. This \"affect control\nprinciple\" has been shown to be a powerful predictor of human behaviour. In\nthis paper, we present a probabilistic and decision-theoretic generalisation of\nthis principle, and we demonstrate how it can be leveraged to build affectively\nintelligent artificial agents. The new model, called BayesAct, can maintain\nmultiple hypotheses about sentiments simultaneously as a probability\ndistribution, and can make use of an explicit utility function to make\nvalue-directed action choices. This allows the model to generate affectively\nintelligent interactions with people by learning about their identity,\npredicting their behaviours using the affect control principle, and taking\nactions that are simultaneously goal-directed and affect-sensitive. We\ndemonstrate this generalisation with a set of simulations. We then show how our\nmodel can be used as an emotional \"plug-in\" for artificially intelligent\nsystems that interact with humans in two different settings: an exam practice\nassistant (tutor) and an assistive device for persons with a cognitive\ndisability.", "machine_text": "We introduce a novel approach to intelligent affective interaction using a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP).

Our simulations revealed that the flow-induced shear stress triggers a rapid unfolding of the RNA hairpin, followed by a slow refolding process. We demonstrated that the unfolding and refolding rates are strongly correlated with the flow velocity, suggesting a mechanistic link between the flow-induced stress and the RNA conformational dynamics. Furthermore, our results show that the flow-dependent unfolding and refolding are influenced by the RNA's secondary structure and the flow-induced deformation of the RNA molecule.

We demonstrate that PMI outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency on a range of benchmark datasets. PMI's key innovation is its ability to integrate multiple network features and prior knowledge to inform module inference. Our approach also provides a principled way to set a threshold for module detection, ensuring that identified modules are statistically significant.

The theory\naims to simplify and integrate concepts across artificial intelligence,\nmainstream computing and human perception and cognition, with information\ncompression as a unifying theme. It is conceived as a brain-like system that\nreceives 'New' information and stores some or all of it in compressed form as\n'Old' information. It is realised in the form of a computer model -- a first\nversion of the SP machine. The concept of \"multiple alignment\" is a powerful\ncentral idea. Using heuristic techniques, the system builds multiple alignments\nthat are 'good' in terms of information compression. For each multiple\nalignment, probabilities may be calculated. These provide the basis for\ncalculating the probabilities of inferences. The system learns new structures\nfrom partial matches between patterns. Using heuristic techniques, the system\nsearches for sets of structures that are 'good' in terms of information\ncompression. These are normally ones that people judge to be 'natural', in\naccordance with the 'DONSVIC' principle -- the discovery of natural structures\nvia information compression. The SP theory may be applied in several areas\nincluding 'computing', aspects of mathematics and logic, representation of\nknowledge, natural language processing, pattern recognition, several kinds of\nreasoning, information storage and retrieval, planning and problem solving,\ninformation compression, neuroscience, and human perception and cognition.\nExamples include the parsing and production of language including discontinuous\ndependencies in syntax, pattern recognition at multiple levels of abstraction\nand its integration with part-whole relations, nonmonotonic reasoning and\nreasoning with default values, reasoning in Bayesian networks including\n'explaining away', causal diagnosis, and the solving of a geometric analogy\nproblem.", "machine_text": "In this overview, we present the SP theory of intelligence, which posits that intelligence is comprised of two primary components: spatial ability and processing ability.

Our results show that spatial ability is closely linked to tasks that require visualization, spatial reasoning, and mental rotation, while processing ability is more strongly associated with tasks that demand attention, working memory, and processing speed. Furthermore, we provide evidence that these two components are orthogonal, meaning they are not strongly correlated, and that they can be dissociated in various cognitive tasks. We also discuss the implications of the SP theory for our understanding of intelligence, cognitive development, and education, highlighting potential applications for improving cognitive training and assessment methods.

Our approach leverages the idea of joint sparsity, where we represent the signal as a linear combination of atoms from multiple dictionaries. By formulating the dictionary subselection problem as an optimization problem, we minimize the reconstruction error between the original signal and its sparse representation. We develop a greedy algorithm to efficiently solve the optimization problem, which iteratively selects the most informative dictionaries and updates the sparse representation. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency. The proposed method is particularly effective in scenarios where the dictionaries have diverse structures and the signal has multiple components. By selecting a subset of dictionaries that capture the signal's essential features, our method provides a compact and effective representation of the signal, which has promising applications in various fields, including signal processing, machine learning, and data analysis."}

In this paper we investigate how compressed sensing (CS) can\nprovide new insights into astronomical data compression and more generally how\nit paves the way for new conceptions in astronomical remote sensing. We first\ngive a brief overview of the compressed sensing theory which provides very\nsimple coding process with low computational cost, thus favoring its use for\nreal-time applications often found on board space mission.

The knowledge representation framework is based on a novel graph-based representation, allowing for the explicit modeling of uncertainty and ambiguity. The evidential reasoning module utilizes a probabilistic approach to combine evidence, incorporating domain-specific knowledge and handling incomplete or uncertain data. The decision-making component integrates the outputs of the evidential reasoning module with domain-specific constraints, enabling the engine to produce informed decisions. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate the engine's effectiveness in a range of domains, including medical diagnosis, expert systems, and decision support systems.

We present phase variations for a variety of\ndifferent radiative times and wind speeds. In the limit of instant\nre-radiation, the light curve morphology is entirely dictated by the planet's\neccentricity and argument of pericenter: the light curve maximum leads or\ntrails the eclipse depending on whether the planet is receding from or\napproaching the star at superior conjunction, respectively. For a planet with\nnon-zero radiative timescales, the phase peak occurs early for super- rotating\nwinds, and late for sub-rotating winds.

If the system knows that belief in\nfact is dependent in some way upon belief in fact2, then it automatically\nmodifies its belief in facts when new information causes a change in belief of\nfact2. It models the behavior of a TMS, replacing its 3-valued logic (true,\nfalse, unknown) with an infinite valued logic, in such a way as to reduce to a\nstandard TMS if all statements are given in absolute true/false terms. Belief\nMaintenance Systems can, therefore, be thought of as a generalization of Truth\nMaintenance Systems, whose possible reasoning tasks are a superset of those for\na TMS.", "machine_text": "We introduce a novel approach to building a general-purpose belief maintenance system, which addresses the long-standing challenge of integrating diverse belief revision mechanisms under a unified framework. Our system, designed to operate in dynamic and uncertain environments, leverages a modular architecture that combines probabilistic reasoning, non-monotonic logic, and argumentation theory. We develop a suite of algorithms that enable our system to maintain a consistent and coherent belief state in the face of new information, conflicting beliefs, and changing contexts. Our approach is evaluated through a series of experiments on a range of scenarios, including information fusion, decision-making, and natural language processing. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our system in maintaining accurate and robust beliefs, even in the presence of uncertainty and noise. By providing a general-purpose framework for belief maintenance, our work has significant implications for a wide range of applications, including artificial intelligence, decision support systems, and human-computer interaction."}

A signal result from\nthese studies is that the hardness of SAT problems exhibits a dramatic\neasy-to-hard phase transition with respect to the problem constrainedness. Past\nstudies have however focused mostly on SAT instances generated using uniform\nrandom distributions, where all constraints are independently generated, and\nthe problem variables are all considered of equal importance. These assumptions\nare unfortunately not satisfied by most real problems. Our project aims for a\ndeeper understanding of hardness of SAT problems that arise in practice.

Several of the candidate\ndefinitions do not have these two properties. Only one candidate definition of\nthose considered satisfies both properties. We propose that a \"confounder\" be\ndefined as a pre-exposure covariate C for which there exists a set of other\ncovariates X such that effect of the exposure on the outcome is unconfounded\nconditional on (X,C) but such that for no proper subset of (X,C) is the effect\nof the exposure on the outcome unconfounded given the subset.

By leveraging the spectral properties of the graph Laplacian, we devise a clustering algorithm that efficiently captures the underlying network structure, even in the presence of noise and outliers. Our approach, termed spectral redemption, leverages the idea of spectral embedding to project the high-dimensional graph into a lower-dimensional space, where traditional clustering algorithms can be applied. We demonstrate the effectiveness of spectral redemption through extensive experiments on a range of real-world networks, including social networks, citation networks, and biological networks.

Our method first decomposes the ultrasound image into multiple scales using a wavelet transform, and then applies an adaptive filtering scheme to each scale. The filtering scheme is based on the local variance of the image and adapts to the local noise level. Our results show significant improvement in image quality, with a reduction in noise power of up to 70% compared to existing methods.

To process noisy data samples from a nonlinear manifold, PCA\nmust be applied locally, at a scale small enough such that the manifold is\napproximately linear, but at a scale large enough such that structure may be\ndiscerned from noise. Using eigenspace perturbation theory and non-asymptotic\nrandom matrix theory, we study the stability of the subspace estimated by PCA\nas a function of scale, and bound (with high probability) the angle it forms\nwith the true tangent space. By adaptively selecting the scale that minimizes\nthis bound, our analysis reveals an appropriate scale for local tangent plane\nrecovery. We also introduce a geometric uncertainty principle quantifying the\nlimits of noise-curvature perturbation for stable recovery. With the purpose of\nproviding perturbation bounds that can be used in practice, we propose plug-in\nestimates that make it possible to directly apply the theoretical results to\nreal data sets.", "machine_text": "We present a non-asymptotic analysis of tangent space perturbation, a fundamental problem in optimization and machine learning. We address the question of how to bound the impact of perturbations in the tangent space on the optimization landscape, a crucial concern in the design of efficient algorithms.

We demonstrate that our method provides a tighter bound than existing results, and is computationally efficient. Our results have significant implications for the development of robust optimization algorithms, and have the potential to improve the performance of a wide range of machine learning models.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of NATM on several benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on image classification and annotation tasks. Specifically, our model outperforms existing methods by a significant margin on the Stanford 40 Actions dataset, achieving an average precision of 92.3% for action classification and 85.6% for action annotation. Moreover, NATM achieves competitive results on the CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets, demonstrating its versatility and applicability to various image classification and annotation tasks. Overall, our work showcases the potential of neural autoregressive topic models for simultaneous image classification and annotation, and we believe that NATM can serve as a valuable tool for various computer vision applications."}

Three sources of\nthis performance improvement are (1) two heuristics for initialization of the\nimportance function that are based on the theoretical properties of importance\nsampling in finite-dimensional integrals and the structural advantages of\nBayesian networks, (2) a smooth learning method for the importance function,\nand (3) a dynamic weighting function for combining samples from different\nstages of the algorithm. We tested the performance of the AIS-BN algorithm\nalong with two state of the art general purpose sampling algorithms, likelihood\nweighting (Fung and Chang, 1989; Shachter and Peot, 1989) and self-importance\nsampling (Shachter and Peot, 1989).

Using a combination of theoretical and computational methods, including network simulations and statistical analysis, we identify key conditions under which competitive contagion is more likely to occur and spread. Our findings have important implications for understanding the dynamics of social networks, decision-making, and opinion formation, and can inform strategies for mitigating the negative consequences of competitive contagion in real-world applications"}

The degree of distortion depends upon the apparent\ndistance to the sky, which is influenced by the surrounding objects and the\ncondition of the sky. As the apparent distance to the sky decreases, the\nillusion becomes stronger. At the horizon, apparent distance to the sky is\nminimal, whereas at the zenith, few distance cues are present, causing\ndifficulty with distance estimation and weakening the illusion.", "machine_text": "We demonstrate that binocular disparity is a crucial factor in explaining the moon illusion. Our study addresses the long-standing question of why the moon appears larger on the horizon than when it is overhead. We employ a combination of psychophysical experiments and computational modeling to investigate the role of binocular disparity in the moon illusion. Our results show that the disparity between the left and right eyes, which is typically used to calculate depth, plays a significant role in the perceived size of the moon. Specifically, we find that the disparity between the left and right eyes is greater when the moon is on the horizon than when it is overhead, leading to an increase in perceived size. Our computational model, which incorporates binocular disparity and other visual cues, accurately predicts the moon illusion and provides a quantitative explanation for the phenomenon. Our findings have important implications for our understanding of visual perception and the role of binocular disparity in shaping our visual experience."}

The DIMSBM is applied to a real-world dataset of online social networks and demonstrates improved performance compared to existing models in capturing the dynamic community structure and node activity patterns.

We evaluate our approach on a diverse set of benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in summarization accuracy and fluency. Our results show that UltraStem outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 15% in terms of ROUGE score and 20% in terms of BLEU score. We also conduct a thorough analysis of the impact of ultra-stemming on the summarization process, revealing that it effectively mitigates the issues of over-generation and under-generation. Our findings highlight the importance of ultra-stemming in automatic text summarization and provide a foundation for future research in this area."}

In computer vision\napplications, a binary vector is a feature map of an image, where each binary\ncomponent indicates whether a local feature or structure is present or absent\nwithin a certain cell of the image domain. A Bernoulli template can be\nconsidered as a statistical model for images of objects (or parts of objects)\nfrom the same category. We show that the two-round EM algorithm can learn\nmixture of Bernoulli templates with near optimal precision with high\nprobability, if the Bernoulli templates are sufficiently different and if the\nnumber of features is sufficiently high. We illustrate the theoretical results\nby synthetic and real examples.", "machine_text": "We propose a two-round Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for learning mixtures of Bernoulli templates with a performance guarantee. Our approach addresses the challenging problem of learning a mixture of discrete probability distributions with a fixed number of components, where each component is a Bernoulli distribution. The two-round EM algorithm iteratively refines the estimates of the mixture weights and the Bernoulli templates. In the first round, we use a deterministic initialization to obtain an initial estimate of the mixture weights, and then refine the estimates using the EM algorithm. In the second round, we use the refined estimates of the mixture weights to initialize a new EM algorithm, which refines the estimates of the Bernoulli templates. Our algorithm guarantees a performance bound on the error in estimating the true mixture weights and Bernoulli templates, which is not achievable by a single-round EM algorithm. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm."}

This scheme generalizes\nthe computational scheme proposed by Shafer and Logan1 for diagnostic trees of\nthe type studied by Gordon and Shortliffe, and the slightly more general scheme\ngiven by Shafer for hierarchical evidence. It also generalizes the scheme\nproposed by Pearl for Bayesian causal trees (see Shenoy and Shafer). Pearl's\ncausal trees and Gordon and Shortliffe's diagnostic trees are both ways of\nbreaking the evidence that bears on a large problem down into smaller items of\nevidence that bear on smaller parts of the problem so that these smaller\nproblems can be dealt with one at a time. This localization of effort is often\nessential in order to make the process of probability judgment feasible, both\nfor the person who is making probability judgments and for the machine that is\ncombining them. The basic structure for our scheme is a type of tree that\ngeneralizes both Pearl's and Gordon and Shortliffe's trees. Trees of this\ngeneral type permit localized computation in Pearl's sense. They are based on\nqualitative judgments of conditional independence. We believe that the scheme\nwe describe here will prove useful in expert systems. It is now clear that the\nsuccessful propagation of probabilities or certainty factors in expert systems\nrequires much more structure than can be provided in a pure production-system\nframework. Bayesian schemes, on the other hand, often make unrealistic demands\nfor structure. The propagation of belief functions in trees and more general\nnetworks stands on a middle ground where some sensible and useful things can be\ndone.

It is a very innovative idea;\nwe do not believe that it can be found in the Bayesian literature prior to\nPearl's work. We see our contribution as extending the usefulness of Pearl's\nidea by generalizing it from Bayesian probabilities to belief functions.

The\nexisting LRR solver is based on the alternating direction method (ADM). It\nsuffers from $O(n^3)$ computation complexity due to the matrix-matrix\nmultiplications and matrix inversions, even if partial SVD is used. Moreover,\nintroducing auxiliary variables also slows down the convergence. Such a heavy\ncomputation load prevents LRR from large scale applications. In this paper, we\ngeneralize ADM by linearizing the quadratic penalty term and allowing the\npenalty to change adaptively. We also propose a novel rule to update the\npenalty such that the convergence is fast. With our linearized ADM with\nadaptive penalty (LADMAP) method, it is unnecessary to introduce auxiliary\nvariables and invert matrices. The matrix-matrix multiplications are further\nalleviated by using the skinny SVD representation technique. As a result, we\narrive at an algorithm for LRR with complexity $O(rn^2)$, where $r$ is the rank\nof the representation matrix.

Because this problem is fundamentally ill-posed,\nstrong priors on both the sharp image and blur kernel are required to\nregularize the solution space. While this naturally leads to a standard MAP\nestimation framework, performance is compromised by unknown trade-off parameter\nsettings, optimization heuristics, and convergence issues stemming from\nnon-convexity and/or poor prior selections. To mitigate some of these problems,\na number of authors have recently proposed substituting a variational Bayesian\n(VB) strategy that marginalizes over the high-dimensional image space leading\nto better estimates of the blur kernel. However, the underlying cost function\nnow involves both integrals with no closed-form solution and complex,\nfunction-valued arguments, thus losing the transparency of MAP. Beyond standard\nBayesian-inspired intuitions, it thus remains unclear by exactly what mechanism\nthese methods are able to operate, rendering understanding, improvements and\nextensions more difficult. To elucidate these issues, we demonstrate that the\nVB methodology can be recast as an unconventional MAP problem with a very\nparticular penalty/prior that couples the image, blur kernel, and noise level\nin a principled way. This unique penalty has a number of useful characteristics\npertaining to relative concavity, local minima avoidance, and scale-invariance\nthat allow us to rigorously explain the success of VB including its existing\nimplementational heuristics and approximations. It also provides strict\ncriteria for choosing the optimal image prior that, perhaps\ncounter-intuitively, need not reflect the statistics of natural scenes.

The advantage of this logical formalism\nis that it offers a declarative representation of statistical knowledge;\nknowledge represented in this manner can be used for a variety of reasoning\ntasks. The logic differs from previous work in probability logics in that it\nuses a probability distribution over the domain of discourse, whereas most\nprevious work (e.g., Nilsson [2], Scott et al. [3], Gaifinan [4], Fagin et al.\n[5]) has investigated the attachment of probabilities to the sentences of the\nlogic (also, see Halpern [6] and Bacchus [7] for further discussion of the\ndifferences). The logic Lp possesses some further important features. First, Lp\nis a superset of first order logic, hence it can represent ordinary logical\nassertions. This means that Lp provides a mechanism for integrating statistical\ninformation and reasoning about uncertainty into systems based solely on logic.\nSecond, Lp possesses transparent semantics, based on sets and probabilities of\nthose sets. Hence, knowledge represented in Lp can be understood in terms of\nthe simple primative concepts of sets and probabilities. And finally, the there\nis a sound proof theory that has wide coverage (the proof theory is complete\nfor certain classes of models). The proof theory captures a sufficient range of\nvalid inferences to subsume most previous probabilistic uncertainty reasoning\nsystems. For example, the linear constraints like those generated by Nilsson's\nprobabilistic entailment [2] can be generated by the proof theory, and the\nBayesian inference underlying belief nets [8] can be performed.

Then we present some\nof the varieties of statistical information that Lp is capable of expressing.\nAfter this we present, briefly, the syntax, semantics, and proof theory of the\nlogic. We conclude with a few examples of knowledge representation and\nreasoning in Lp, pointing out the advantages of the declarative representation\noffered by Lp.

Our logic provides a novel framework for combining logical and probabilistic reasoning, allowing us to reason about both certain and uncertain information in a unified and coherent way. The key idea behind Lp is to represent statistical information as a probability distribution over a set of possible worlds, which enables us to leverage the power of probabilistic inference and machine learning algorithms to reason about uncertain information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Lp through a range of experiments and applications, including Bayesian inference, decision-making under uncertainty, and data analysis.

Our analysis indicates that a fruitful direction of research for\nneural LMs lies in developing more accessible internal representations, and\nsuggests an optimization regime of very high momentum terms for effectively\ntraining such models.", "machine_text": "We investigate the role of regularization and nonlinearities in neural language models, examining when and why they are necessary. By analyzing the impact of various regularization techniques and nonlinear activation functions on model performance, we identify key scenarios where these components are crucial for achieving optimal results. Our findings suggest that regularization is particularly important when dealing with overparameterized models, while nonlinearities are essential for capturing complex linguistic patterns and relationships. We also explore the interplay between these components, demonstrating that the optimal choice of regularization and nonlinearity depends on the specific model architecture, task, and dataset. Our results provide insights into the design of effective neural language models, highlighting the importance of carefully selecting and combining regularization and nonlinear components to achieve state-of-the-art performance.  By shedding light on the essential role of these components, our work contributes to a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving neural language processing and informs the development of more accurate and robust language models."}

I focus relatively narrowly on a notion that I call\n\"Knightian freedom\": a certain kind of in-principle physical unpredictability\nthat goes beyond probabilistic unpredictability. Other, more metaphysical\naspects of free will I regard as possibly outside the scope of science. I\nexamine a viewpoint, suggested independently by Carl Hoefer, Cristi Stoica, and\neven Turing himself, that tries to find scope for \"freedom\" in the universe's\nboundary conditions rather than in the dynamical laws. Taking this viewpoint\nseriously leads to many interesting conceptual problems. I investigate how far\none can go toward solving those problems, and along the way, encounter (among\nother things) the No-Cloning Theorem, the measurement problem, decoherence,\nchaos, the arrow of time, the holographic principle, Newcomb's paradox,\nBoltzmann brains, algorithmic information theory, and the Common Prior\nAssumption. I also compare the viewpoint explored here to the more radical\nspeculations of Roger Penrose. The result of all this is an unusual perspective\non time, quantum mechanics, and causation, of which I myself remain skeptical,\nbut which has several appealing features. Among other things, it suggests\ninteresting empirical questions in neuroscience, physics, and cosmology; and\ntakes a millennia-old philosophical debate into some underexplored territory.", "machine_text": "We demonstrate the feasibility of encoding a quantum Turing machine (QTM) within a quantum circuit, enabling the exploration of quantum algorithms and their interaction with quantum error correction codes.

We propose a novel framework that leverages sparse representations to enhance the robustness of face recognition. Our approach involves learning a sparse dictionary of face features that can effectively capture the underlying structure of face images. We demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art face recognition systems in various challenging scenarios, including low-light, partially occluded, and pose-varied conditions. The key to our success lies in the ability of sparse representations to effectively reject noise and irrelevant information, thereby improving the robustness of face recognition. We also analyze the trade-off between sparsity and robustness, showing that a balance between the two is crucial for achieving optimal performance. Our results provide new insights into the interplay between sparsity and robustness in face recognition, and demonstrate the potential of sparse representations for improving the robustness of face recognition systems."}
