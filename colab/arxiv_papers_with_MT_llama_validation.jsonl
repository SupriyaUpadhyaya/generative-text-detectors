However, the\nsame representation and reconstruction framework is not readily applicable in a\nstreaming system: the unknown signal changes over time, and it is measured and\nreconstructed sequentially over small time intervals.\n  In this paper, we discuss two such streaming systems and a homotopy-based\nalgorithm for quickly solving the associated L1-norm minimization programs: 1)\nRecovery of a smooth, time-varying signal for which, instead of using block\ntransforms, we use lapped orthogonal transforms for sparse representation. 2)\nRecovery of a sparse, time-varying signal that follows a linear dynamic model.\nFor both the systems, we iteratively process measurements over a sliding\ninterval and estimate sparse coefficients by solving a weighted L1-norm\nminimization program. Instead of solving a new L1 program from scratch at every\niteration, we use an available signal estimate as a starting point in a\nhomotopy formulation. Starting with a warm-start vector, our homotopy algorithm\nupdates the solution in a small number of computationally inexpensive steps as\nthe system changes. The homotopy algorithm presented in this paper is highly\nversatile as it can update the solution for the L1 problem in a number of\ndynamical settings. We demonstrate with numerical experiments that our proposed\nstreaming recovery framework outperforms the methods that represent and\nreconstruct a signal as independent, disjoint blocks, in terms of quality of\nreconstruction, and that our proposed homotopy-based updating scheme\noutperforms current state-of-the-art solvers in terms of the computation time\nand complexity.", "machine_text": "We address the problem of sparse recovery of streaming signals in real-time, where the goal is to identify the underlying sparse representation of a signal from a limited number of noisy measurements.

Our key idea is to exploit the connection between the shortest program and the Kolmogorov complexity of the input function, allowing us to reduce the problem to a well-studied problem in computational complexity theory. We then employ a careful analysis of the running time of our algorithm, leveraging techniques from approximation algorithms and online algorithms, to demonstrate that our approach achieves a polynomial-time bound. Our results have significant implications for the study of program complexity and the limits of efficient computation, and we discuss the broader implications for the field of theoretical computer science"}

The salient and interesting features that the complex network study\noffer in comparison to graph theory are the emphasis on the dynamical\nproperties of the networks and the ability of inherently uncovering pattern\nformation of the vertices. In this paper, we present a hybrid data\nclassification technique combining a low level and a high level classifier. The\nlow level term can be equipped with any traditional classification techniques,\nwhich realize the classification task considering only physical features (e.g.,\ngeometrical or statistical features) of the input data. On the other hand, the\nhigh level term has the ability of detecting data patterns with semantic\nmeanings. In this way, the classification is realized by means of the\nextraction of the underlying network's features constructed from the input\ndata. As a result, the high level classification process measures the\ncompliance of the test instances with the pattern formation of the training\ndata. Out of various high level perspectives that can be utilized to capture\nsemantic meaning, we utilize the dynamical features that are generated from a\ntourist walker in a networked environment.

Our findings indicate that confidence plays a crucial role in focusing attention, as individuals with higher confidence levels tend to allocate more attention to relevant information and less attention to irrelevant information. We employed a combination of behavioral and neuroimaging methods, including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG), to examine the neural correlates of confidence and attention. Our results show that confidence is associated with increased activity in regions involved in attentional control, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex. Furthermore, we found that individual differences in confidence are related to variations in attentional control, suggesting that confidence may be a key factor in determining how individuals allocate attention during knowledge acquisition. Our study provides new insights into the complex interplay between confidence, attention, and knowledge acquisition, highlighting the importance of considering confidence as a critical component of attentional processes."}

Our analysis of a diverse range of organisms, from simple multicellular animals to complex plants, shows that dGRNs undergo a characteristic transition from a diffuse, spatially-unstructured state to a modular, compartmentalized organization. This transition is driven by the co-evolution of gene regulatory elements and transcription factors, which create functional boundaries and promote the emergence of autonomous developmental modules. Using a combination of phylogenetic and comparative genomics approaches, we identify key genetic and epigenetic innovations that facilitate this transition, including the evolution of transcription factor binding sites, enhancer elements, and chromatin-modifying complexes.

In particular, we focus on the coding of a data point with a local\nrepresentation based on a dictionary with fewer elements than the number of\ndata points, and view it as an approximation to the actual function that would\ncompute pair-wise similarity to all data points (often too many to compute in\npractice), followed by a Nystrom sampling step to select a subset of all data\npoints.\n  Furthermore, since bounds are known on the approximation power of Nystrom\nsampling as a function of how many samples (i.e. dictionary size) we consider,\nwe can derive bounds on the approximation of the exact (but expensive to\ncompute) kernel matrix, and use it as a proxy to predict accuracy as a function\nof the dictionary size, which has been observed to increase but also to\nsaturate as we increase its size. This model may help explaining the positive\neffect of the codebook size and justifying the need to stack more layers (often\nreferred to as deep learning), as flat models empirically saturate as we add\nmore complexity.", "machine_text": "We demonstrate that the long-standing problem of feature coding can be addressed by applying Nystrom sampling, a well-known technique for approximating kernel matrices. By sampling a subset of features and reweighting them according to their importance, we show that the resulting feature codes can be used to approximate the original data distribution with high accuracy. Our results indicate that the size of the sampled subset has a significant impact on the quality of the approximation, with larger subsets generally leading to better performance. We also investigate the effects of different sampling strategies and demonstrate that a simple random sampling approach can outperform more complex methods in many cases. Our findings have important implications for a wide range of applications, including dimensionality reduction, clustering, and classification, where feature coding is often used to reduce the computational complexity of high-dimensional data. By providing a principled approach to feature coding, our work opens up new possibilities for efficient and accurate analysis of large-scale datasets."}

Given any\ninstance of an $\\ell_2$-loss soft-margin (or hard-margin) SVM, we construct a\nLasso instance having the same optimal solutions, and vice versa.\n  As a consequence, many existing optimization algorithms for both SVMs and\nLasso can also be applied to the respective other problem instances. Also, the\nequivalence allows for many known theoretical insights for SVM and Lasso to be\ntranslated between the two settings. One such implication gives a simple\nkernelized version of the Lasso, analogous to the kernels used in the SVM\nsetting. Another consequence is that the sparsity of a Lasso solution is equal\nto the number of support vectors for the corresponding SVM instance, and that\none can use screening rules to prune the set of support vectors. Furthermore,\nwe can relate sublinear time algorithms for the two problems, and give a new\nsuch algorithm variant for the Lasso. We also study the regularization paths\nfor both methods.", "machine_text": "We establish an equivalence between the Lasso and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) in the context of binary classification, demonstrating that the two algorithms can be viewed as equivalent formulations of the same problem. By leveraging the connection between the Lasso and SVMs, we derive a novel regularized optimization problem that can be solved using standard SVM solvers. Our approach enables the exploitation of the strengths of both algorithms, allowing for efficient and effective classification. We demonstrate the equivalence through a thorough analysis of the Lagrangian dual problems, showing that the Lasso and SVMs have identical optimality conditions. Our results provide a deeper understanding of the relationship between the Lasso and SVMs, and offer a new perspective on the design of classification algorithms. By recognizing the equivalence between these two popular methods, we can leverage their combined strengths to develop more effective and efficient classification strategies."}

Most protein domain ranking methods rely on the pairwise comparison of\nprotein domains while neglecting the global manifold structure of the protein\ndomain database. Recently, graph regularized ranking that exploits the global\nstructure of the graph defined by the pairwise similarities has been proposed.\nHowever, the existing graph regularized ranking methods are very sensitive to\nthe choice of the graph model and parameters, and this remains a difficult\nproblem for most of the protein domain ranking methods.\n  Results To tackle this problem, we have developed the Multiple Graph\nregularized Ranking algorithm, MultiG- Rank. Instead of using a single graph to\nregularize the ranking scores, MultiG-Rank approximates the intrinsic manifold\nof protein domain distribution by combining multiple initial graphs for the\nregularization. Graph weights are learned with ranking scores jointly and\nautomatically, by alternately minimizing an ob- jective function in an\niterative algorithm. Experimental results on a subset of the ASTRAL SCOP\nprotein domain database demonstrate that MultiG-Rank achieves a better ranking\nperformance than single graph regularized ranking methods and pairwise\nsimilarity based ranking methods.\n  Conclusion The problem of graph model and parameter selection in graph\nregularized protein domain ranking can be solved effectively by combining\nmultiple graphs.

In RC the fundamental principles of General\nRelativity are applied directly to a tessellated spacetime geometry. In this\nmanuscript, and in the spirit of this conference, we reexamine the foundations\nof RC and emphasize the central role that the Voronoi and Delaunay lattices\nplay in this discrete theory. In particular we describe, for the first time, a\ngeometric construction of the scalar curvature invariant at a vertex. This\nderivation makes use of a new fundamental lattice cell built from elements\ninherited from both the simplicial (Delaunay) spacetime and its circumcentric\ndual (Voronoi) lattice. The orthogonality properties between these two lattices\nyield an expression for the vertex-based scalar curvature which is strikingly\nsimilar to the corresponding and more familiar hinge-based expression in RC\n(deficit angle per unit Voronoi dual area). In particular, we show that the\nscalar curvature is simply a vertex-based weighted average of deficits per\nweighted average of dual areas. What is most striking to us is how naturally\nspacetime is represented by Voronoi and Delaunay structures and that the laws\nof gravity appear to be encoded locally on the lattice spacetime with less\ncomplexity than in the continuum, yet the continuum is recovered by convergence\nin mean.

Rational decision making involves using\ninformation which is almost always imperfect and incomplete as well as some\nintelligent machine which if it is a human being is inconsistent to make\ndecisions. In the theory of bounded rationality this decision is made\nirrespective of the fact that the information to be used is incomplete and\nimperfect and the human brain is inconsistent and thus this decision that is to\nbe made is taken within the bounds of these limitations.

Our approach addresses the challenging problem of estimating the underlying branching rates and population sizes from incomplete observations, which are often encountered in real-world ecological applications. We employ a Bayesian non-parametric approach, combining a Dirichlet process mixture model with a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, to infer the branching rates and population sizes. Our methodology allows for flexible modeling of the branching process, incorporating both discrete and continuous types, and accommodates varying levels of observation noise. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through simulations and an application to a real-world dataset on the dynamics of a marine ecosystem. Our results show that our method can accurately recover the underlying branching rates and population sizes, even in the presence of significant observation noise.

Based on exhaustive numerical experiments, we observe that the IRLS\nalgorithm is globally convergent (for arbitrary initialization) in the convex\nregime $1 \\leq p \\leq 2$, and locally convergent (fails very rarely using NLM\ninitialization) in the non-convex regime $0 < p < 1$.

Unlike most other approaches where a causal explanation is\na hypothesis that one or more causative events occurred, we define an\nexplanation of a set of observations to be an occurrence of a chain of\ncausation events.

We show that the probabilities of the scenarios can be\ncomputed from the conditional probabilities of the causation events. Abductive\nreasoning is inherently complex even if only modest expressive power is\nallowed. However, our abduction algorithm is exponential only in the number of\nobservations to be explained, and is polynomial in the size of the knowledge\nbase. This contrasts with many other abduction procedures that are exponential\nin the size of the knowledge base.", "machine_text": "We present a novel approach to abductive diagnosis that integrates probabilistic, taxonomic, and causal knowledge.

For such systems, it is important to identify the\noperating envelope or the boundary of stable operation for diagnostics and\ncontrol purposes. Obtaining a good model of the operating envelope using\nphysics becomes intractable owing to engine transient effects. In this paper, a\nmachine learning based approach is employed to identify the stable operating\nboundary of HCCI combustion directly from experimental data. Owing to imbalance\nin class proportions in the data, two approaches are considered. A re-sampling\n(under-sampling, over-sampling) based approach is used to develop models using\nexisting algorithms while a cost-sensitive approach is used to modify the\nlearning algorithm without modifying the data set. Support vector machines and\nrecently developed extreme learning machines are used for model development and\nresults compared against linear classification methods show that cost-sensitive\nversions of ELM and SVM algorithms are well suited to model the HCCI operating\nenvelope. The prediction results indicate that the models have the potential to\nbe used for predicting HCCI instability based on sensor measurement history.", "machine_text": "We employed class imbalance learning to model the stable operating envelope for partially stable combustion engines.

We briefly review a variety of approaches for using data\nto construct the decision rules. We then review an interesting challenge, that\nof nonregularity that often arises in this area. By nonregularity, we mean the\nparameters indexing the optimal dynamic treatment regime are nonsmooth\nfunctionals of the underlying generative distribution.\n  A consequence is that no regular or asymptotically unbiased estimator of\nthese parameters exists. Nonregularity arises in inference for parameters in\nthe optimal dynamic treatment regime; we illustrate the effect of nonregularity\non asymptotic bias and via sensitivity of asymptotic, limiting, distributions\nto local perturbations. We propose and evaluate a locally consistent Adaptive\nConfidence Interval (ACI) for the parameters of the optimal dynamic treatment\nregime. We use data from the Adaptive Interventions for Children with ADHD\nstudy as an illustrative example.

We propose a novel estimator that leverages the sequential nature of the data and accounts for the temporal dependencies between treatment assignments and outcomes. Our methodology is based on a combination of Bayesian and frequentist techniques, which enables us to provide both point estimates and uncertainty quantification for the treatment effects. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through simulations and an application to a real-world dataset, showcasing its ability to provide accurate and reliable estimates of treatment effects in dynamic treatment regimes.

There are any\nnumber of people whom one might call probability enthusiasts who feel that\nprobability provides all the answers by itself, with no need of help from\nlogic.

A slightly weaker form of this approach is captured by Nilsson\n[15], where one assumes certain probabilities for certain statements, and\ninfers the probabilities, or constraints on the probabilities of other\nstatement. None of this corresponds to what I call probabilistic inference. All\nof the inference that is taking place, either in Bayesian updating, or in\nprobabilistic logic, is strictly deductive.
