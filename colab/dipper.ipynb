In the\\nsecond part we consider the continuum limit of this theory, namely, the reverse\\nprocess in which one starts from the discrete theory and tries to recover back\\nthe ordinary Schroedinger quantum mechanics.

This entails the superfluidity of the sphere. This entails the study of the quantum mechanics in polymer chains, which are two-dimensional systems with no neighbouring particles. The first model consists of an ensemble of fermions on a chain. This is the generalization of Hubbard’s equation, which contains no fermions. It is a generalization of the Hubbard equation, which contains the same spinless fermions. It includes the spin-dependent hopping amplitudes and the repulsive interaction terms. The second model is based on bosons moving along a ring. It is here that we demonstrate that the energy per particle is zero when the number of particles increases by infinity.

To resolve the AE problem, the researchers have used some advanced techniques, such as: first, they take the emitted signal and separate it into many components, then they use this to elicit the location of multiple AEs with a high accuracy. In this work, we are focusing on a new method of the acoustic emission that uses sparse representations and compressive sensitivity, which aims to obtain the position of the AEs with high accuracy.

We demonstrate this method in the laboratory and in the laboratory, and show that it is very effective, and can be used to identify multiple AEs at once.

In the context of bosonic string theory we consider on-shell\\npp-waves and argue that universality requires the existence of a universal\\nsector of world-sheet operators whose correlation functions are insensitive to\\nthe pp-wave nature of the metric and the background gauge flux. Such results\\ncan also be reproduced using the world-sheet conformal field theory. We also\\nstudy such pp-waves in non-polynomial closed string field theory (CSFT). In\\nparticular, we argue that for an off-shell pp-wave ansatz with flat transverse\\nspace and dilaton independent of transverse coordinates the field redefinition\\nrelating the low energy effective field theory and CSFT with all the massive\\nmodes integrated out is at most quadratic in fields. Because of this\\nsimplification it is expected that the off-shell pp-waves can be identified on\\nthe two sides. Furthermore, given the massless pp-wave field configurations, an\\niterative method for computing the higher massive modes using the CSFT\\nequations of motion has been discussed.

The main aim of this is to make it possible to analyze vast amounts of experimental data in a few minutes. We present an approach to this, combining advanced statistical techniques with the present knowledge, for the first time. We demonstrate two examples: First, we study the effect of the dielectric on the electrical conductivity of a semiconductor compound, and second, we find the critical temperature Tc for superconductivity of a cuprate. In both cases, we find that our results agree very well with the theories, and we demonstrate how this method allows one to discover previously unobserved features.

Our goal is to build up a new and flexible computational tool that can solve complex radiative transfer problems quickly and with accuracy. In this project we have employed the method of accelerated lambda iteration and the method of opacity sampling, which is a combination of the advantages of both of these techniques, and it has a parallel processing of many CPU cores, and supports various input formats. We have adapted this new computational tool to address this challenge and show that the results are in agreement with those of the previous authors. We have shown that it is possible to solve the problem in a short time and in a simple way. For instance, we have to work for two days to analyze the entire spectrum of a single atom with the spectral parameters of the atom. However, this task requires a certain degree of mathematical expertise and it is difficult to perform it without some kind of complicated numerical analysis. This task has traditionally been carried out by a variety of methods that are based on the same statistical equilibrium equation for each level of the sky. Such methods are repeated over many different models until convergence is reached, and resulting in the latter being very time-consuming, even for the simplest problems, up to the', 'model': 'bigscience bloomz', 'source': 'arxiv'}, {'source_id': 704.0162, 'title': 'Estimation of experimental data redundancy and related statistics', 'abstract': '  Redundancy of experimental data is the basic statistic from which the\\ncomplexity of a natural phenomenon and the proper number of experiments needed\\nfor its exploration can be estimated. The redundancy is expressed by the\\nentropy of information pertaining to the probability density function of\\nexperimental variables. Since the calculation of entropy is inconvenient due to\\nintegration over a range of variables, an approximate expression for redundancy\\nis derived that includes only a sum over the set of experimental data about\\nthese variables. The approximation makes feasible an efficient estimation of\\nthe redundancy of data along with the related experimental information and\\ninformation cost function. From the experimental information the complexity of\\nthe phenomenon can be simply estimated, while the proper number of experiments\\nneeded for its exploration can be determined from the minimum of the cost\\nfunction. The performance of the approximate estimation of these statistics is\\ndemonstrated on two-dimensional normally distributed random data.\\n', 'paraphrased_abstract': 'If we want to measure something precisely, it is necessary to ensure that the correlation between repeated measurements of a given subject is not such that it exceeds a certain threshold. The problem is to calculate the number of independent measurements of an experiment. It will be necessary to know how many independent measurements are required in an experiment. The first question will be: how many independent measurements are required in an experiment? The third question is: how many independent measurements must we have, so that the average deviation of the measured values does not exceed a certain threshold? Then the problem will be: how many independent measurements do we have to make, in order to get the average deviation of the measured values to exceed the specified threshold? Then the question is: how many independent measurements do we have to make, if the experimental data is known, and the number of them is known. ', 'model': 'bigscience bloomz', 'source': 'arxiv'}]\n"

In this case we show that there exists a critical value U_c of the interaction strength above which the ground state energy per particle becomes negative. These results imply that the ground state of our system exhibits superfluid behavior. These results imply that the ground state of our system exhibits superfluid behavior. Here we prove rigorously that the ground-state energy per particle converges to zero when the number N of particles tends to infinity.

It was also observed that the strain rate does not affect the mechanical behavior of SWCNTs. In general, carbon nanotubes can be divided into two categories, namely zigzag tubes and armchair tubes. Zigzag tubes consist of alternating double bonds along its axis whereas armchair tubes consist only of single bonds. There exists another type called chiral tubes whose helicity lies somewhere between zigzag and armchair tubes. Among these two categories exist several distinct families of carbon nanotubes...

Adding to these features we detect a soft excess below 2 keV. This feature cannot be explained by thermal plasma models or reflection components alone but requires additional contributions from ionized absorbers and/or partial covering neutral material.

Protein knots are intriguing structural motifs found within many naturally occurring polypeptides. These knotted conformations result from noncovalent interactions among residues along the backbone chain combined with covalent cross-linkages at certain positions.
