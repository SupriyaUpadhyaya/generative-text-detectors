The aim of our work is to better understand the quantum behavior of polymers and its relationship to the classical theory. Our research attempts to clarify the nature of the continuum limit and determine the correctness of the approximations made. Specifically, we study the connectivity of the polymer strands. We find that a continuous path can be defined in the polymer configuration space, which is essential for the polymer to display continuum behavior. We show that the approximation of continuous randomness in the spatial variable can certainly be used when the polymer is stretched out over a significant distance. For a coil-like polymer, our results demonstrate that its behavior is non-classical.\\n\\nOur methodology involves a careful combination of intuition, formalism, and numerical simulations. We evaluate a path integral representation of polymer quantum mechanics in the continuum limit, and use numerical simulations to support our results.

We study the statistical equilibrium of this system, and find that the polymers form clusters whose sizes are given by a power law distribution. This is in contrast to the traditional picture of polymers in solution, where the thermodynamic equilibrium is described by a mean-field theory based on the solution of the mean-field Boltzmann equation. We show that this difference is due to a breakdown of the assumptions that were used to derive the mean-field theory. In particular, we show that the polymer-polymer interactions in the system considered are non-local, and are thus not described by the mean-field theory. We then derive a new theory for the statistical equilibrium in the presence of an external force, which includes a correction to the mean-field theory. The new theory predicts that the polymer clusters become less dense as the external force increases, in clear contrast to the predictions of the mean-field theory. We analyze this disagreement, and show that it is due to the fact that the mean-field theory predicts a non-monotonic dependence of the polymer-polymer interaction strength on the external force, while our theory predicts a strictly monotonic dependence. We then consider the limit of our theory as the number of polymers in the system tends to infinity, and show that it describes a model of polymer quantum mechanics in a Box, which is a system with a large number of infinitely-lived polymers that interact via a non-local potential, and are in statistical equilibrium in the presence of an external force. We analyze this model, and show that it describes a system with anomalous diffusion and ballistic transport, which is analogous to the anomalous behavior observed in recent experiments on pedestrians.', 'model': 'command-xlarge-nightly', 'source': 'arxiv'}\n",
