relations of quantum mechanics systems, known as the polymer representation has
gained some attention in recent years, due to its possible relation with Planck
scale physics. In particular, this approach has been followed in a symmetric
sector of loop quantum gravity known as loop quantum cosmology. Here we explore
different aspects of the relation between the ordinary Schroedinger theory and
the polymer description. The paper has two parts. In the first one, we derive
the polymer quantum mechanics starting from the ordinary Schroedinger theory
and show that the polymer description arises as an appropriate limit. In the
second part we consider the continuum limit of this theory, namely, the reverse
process in which one starts from the discrete theory and tries to recover back
the ordinary Schroedinger quantum mechanics. We consider several examples of
interest, including the harmonic oscillator, the free particle and a simple
cosmological model.
","In this paper, we study the continuum of the polymer atoms. We present our results in the form of a numerical simulation. We present a solution of the continuum of the polymer atoms. We test the convergence of the atoms, the properties of the atoms, and the nature of the quantum. The results of this study provide a theoretical basis for further studies of other polymer properties, which are still poorly understood. We present the integral, the partial, and the integral representations of polymer atoms, and we use numerical simulations to prove the results. We investigate the connection between the atoms, determining the degree of continuity of the periodicity, which is necessary to describe the atoms in a continuous manner. We find that it is possible to define a continuous path through the polymer, and this is necessary for the polymer to behave in a continuous manner. In the atom space, we find a continuous path, which is necessary for the atoms to be of the same general type.

of criteria for isolating bona fide young stellar objects, YSO's, from the
extensive background contamination by extra-galactic objects. We then discuss
the properties of the resulting high confidence set of YSO's. We find 235 such
objects in the 0.85 deg^2 field that was covered with both IRAC and MIPS. An
additional set of 51 lower confidence YSO's outside this area is identified
from the MIPS data combined with 2MASS photometry. We describe two sets of
results, color-color diagrams to compare our observed source properties with
those of theoretical models for star/disk/envelope systems and our own modeling
of the subset of our objects that appear to be star+disks. These objects
exhibit a very wide range of disk properties, from many that can be fit with
actively accreting disks to some with both passive disks and even possibly
debris disks. We find that the luminosity function of YSO's in Serpens extends
down to at least a few x .001 Lsun or lower for an assumed distance of 260 pc.
The lower limit may be set by our inability to distinguish YSO's from
extra-galactic sources more than by the lack of YSO's at very low luminosities.
A spatial clustering analysis shows that the nominally less-evolved YSO's are
more highly clustered than the later stages and that the background
extra-galactic population can be fit by the same two-point correlation function
as seen in other extra-galactic studies. We also present a table of matches
between several previous infrared and X-ray studies of the Serpens YSO
population and our Spitzer data set.
","A variety of YSOs, namely YSOs of the type I and YSOs of the type II type, were found in the Serpens region. The Serpens region was a close-up region of the star formation, which is the best location for the study of YSOs. This is the region of the Serpens region, and it is therefore suitable for the study of planetary formation. The main goal of this research is to find out more about the YSOs, the process of formation, and the properties of YSOs, including YSOs of the type I and the type II. We will use color and color charts to identify the different YSOs, their age and their distribution, and also to distinguish between disks and envelopes. Our study showed that there were 581 YSOs in the Serpens cloud, all Class I and Class II, and some also of Class II. We analyzed 581 YSOs in the Serpens cloud, ranging from class I to class II, and we found that the number of YSOs was uneven in the center of the cloud, and in the central cluster the most abundant YSOs were seen.

in quiescence during 1991 and 2001 are presented. Spin-modulated radial
velocities consistent with an outer disc origin were detected for the first
time in an IP. The spin pulsation was modulated with velocities near ~500-600
km/s. These velocities are consistent with those of material circulating at the
outer edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretion
curtain with material near the Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Doppler
tomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extending
from velocities of ~500 km/s to ~1000 km/s. These findings have confirmed the
theoretical model predictions of King & Wynn (1999), Belle et al. (2002) and
Norton et al. (2004) for EX Hya, which predict large accretion curtains that
extend to a distance close to the Roche lobe radius in this system. Evidence
for overflow stream of material falling onto the magnetosphere was observed,
confirming the result of Belle et al. (2005) that disc overflow in EX Hya is
present during quiescence as well as outburst. It appears that the hbeta and
hgamma spin radial velocities originated from the rotation of the funnel at the
outer disc edge, while those of halpha were produced due to the flow of
material along the field lines far from the white dwarf (narrow component) and
close to the white dwarf (broad-base component), in agreement with the
accretion curtain model.
","The study has shown that the accretion process in the intermediate polar region is inextricably induced by the changes in the climate and the accretion rates, and that the environment around the white dwarf is highly inhospitable to temperature changes. Our results give new insights into the accretion process of the polar regions, and give a comprehensive understanding of the complex structure of the processes. We present the results of a spectroscopic survey of the EX Hydrae in its quiescent state. In this research we systematically investigate the origin of the emission zones and the physical properties of the accretion geometry. From the observation of the line of sight we find a broad and broad range of velocities, indicating that there is an extremely unsymmetrical flow of accretion. We also find small emission lines from the column of accretion and the rapidly moving white dwarf, which suggests the presence of a hot spot on the surface of the white dwarf.

equations with non-commutative vector fields whose solution evolves on a smooth

along the manifold, we pull back the stochastic flow on the manifold to the Lie
group via the action, and subsequently pull back the flow to the corresponding
Lie algebra via the exponential map. We construct an approximation to the
stochastic flow in the Lie algebra via closed operations and then push back to
the Lie group and then to the manifold, thus ensuring our approximation lies in
the manifold. We call such schemes stochastic Munthe-Kaas methods after their
deterministic counterparts. We also present stochastic Lie group integration
schemes based on Castell--Gaines methods. These involve using an underlying
ordinary differential integrator to approximate the flow generated by a
truncated stochastic exponential Lie series. They become stochastic Lie group
integrator schemes if we use Munthe-Kaas methods as the underlying ordinary
differential integrator. Further, we show that some Castell--Gaines methods are
uniformly more accurate than the corresponding stochastic Taylor schemes.
Lastly we demonstrate our methods by simulating the dynamics of a free rigid
body such as a satellite and an autonomous underwater vehicle both perturbed by
two independent multiplicative stochastic noise processes.

Here we point out the potential of chromospheric observations at millimeter
wavelengths to resolve this long-standing problem. Computations carried out
with a sophisticated dynamic model of the solar chromosphere due to Carlsson
and Stein demonstrate that millimeter emission is extremely sensitive to
dynamic processes in the chromosphere and the appropriate wavelengths to look
for dynamic signatures are in the range 0.8-5.0 mm. The model also suggests
that high resolution observations at mm wavelengths, as will be provided by
ALMA, will have the unique property of reacting to both the hot and the cool
gas, and thus will have the potential of distinguishing between rival models of
the solar atmosphere. Thus, initial results obtained from the observations of
the quiet Sun at 3.5 mm with the BIMA array (resolution of 12 arcsec) reveal
significant oscillations with amplitudes of 50-150 K and frequencies of 1.5-8
mHz with a tendency toward short-period oscillations in internetwork and longer
periods in network regions. However higher spatial resolution, such as that
provided by ALMA, is required for a clean separation between the features
within the solar atmosphere and for an adequate comparison with the output of
the comprehensive dynamic simulations.

special attention to the inclusion of NSI-induced resonant conversions, which
may take place in the most deleptonised inner layers. We study the possibility
of detecting NSI effects in a Megaton water Cherenkov detector, either through
modulation effects in the $\bar\nu_e$ spectrum due to (i) the passage of shock
waves through the SN envelope, (ii) the time dependence of the electron
fraction and (iii) the Earth matter effects; or, finally, through the possible
detectability of the neutronization $\nu_e$ burst. We find that the $\bar\nu_e$
spectrum can exhibit dramatic features due to the internal NSI-induced resonant
conversion. This occurs for non-universal NSI strengths of a few %, and for
very small flavor-changing NSI above a few$\times 10^{-5}$.

form factor, obtains \la r^2\ra^\pi_s=0.75\pm 0.07 fm^2. This value is larger

show that by imposing continuity of the resulting pion scalar form factor under
tiny changes in the input \pi\pi phase shifts, a zero in the form factor for
some S-wave I=0 T-matrices is then required. Once this is accounted for, the
resulting value is \la r^2\ra_s^\pi=0.65\pm 0.05 fm^2. The main source of error
in our determination is present experimental uncertainties in low energy S-wave
I=0 \pi\pi phase shifts. Another important contribution to our error is the not

QCD.

Boltzmann methods (LBM). These limiters erase spurious oscillations without
blurring of shocks, and do not affect smooth solutions. In general, they do the
same work for LBM as flux limiters do for finite differences, finite volumes
and finite elements methods, but for LBM the main idea behind the construction
of nonequilibrium entropy limiter schemes is to transform a field of a scalar
quantity - nonequilibrium entropy. There are two families of limiters: (i)
based on restriction of nonequilibrium entropy (entropy ""trimming"") and (ii)
based on filtering of nonequilibrium entropy (entropy filtering). The physical
properties of LBM provide some additional benefits: the control of entropy
production and accurate estimate of introduced artificial dissipation are
possible. The constructed limiters are tested on classical numerical examples:
1D athermal shock tubes with an initial density ratio 1:2 and the 2D lid-driven
cavity for Reynolds numbers Re between 2000 and 7500 on a coarse 100*100 grid.
All limiter constructions are applicable for both entropic and non-entropic
quasiequilibria.
","The present work represents a significant contribution to the field of lattice Boltzmann methods, and the prospects of this research are numerous. The problem is that the flowing is characterized by no-one’s-eyes in the temperature range, and it is a mathematical difficulty to obtain an accurate recollection. We have developed a new method for non-eyes in a lattice Boltzmann method, and we have formulated the non-eyes as an extra-ordinary form of non-eyes, which, through the modification of the relaxation time, renders the recollection more accurate and the numerical error less probable. Our approach provides an alternative approach to the analysis of high-frequency, non-eye-spot flows, with high-frequency and non-stop variations, which result in a numerical error of a rather large size. The result of this research is to describe and develop a new method of non-eyes, based on a modified relaxation time, which allows the recollection of the recurrence of the flow to equilibrium, and thus thereby reducing the errors which can be introduced by means of the non-eye-spot method. In this study, we present the development of the no-eye-spot approach in a lattice-boltzmann method, which aims to accurately simulate complex",0.35294117647058826,0.4444444444444444,0.25405405405405407,0.735632183908046,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0.13283162365179818,0.30215946952219375,0.13618677042801555,0.35064935064935066,0,0,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1

plasmas (solar wind, interstellar medium, galaxy clusters, accretion disks).
The key assumptions are that the turbulence is anisotropic with respect to the
mean magnetic field and frequencies are low compared to the ion cyclotron
frequency. The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted
into heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETIC
CASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and
velocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each of
the physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematically
reduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the ""inertial range"" above the
ion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenic
fluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisional
and collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,
which obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated
with the Alfvenic component. In the ""dissipation range"" between the ion and
electron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave
(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive
phase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings the
energy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionless
wave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the
phase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at the
electron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scaling
relations are derived for these cascades. Astrophysical and space-physical
applications are discussed in detail.

in the presence of variable topography and bottom friction, modeled by the
Chezy law, but also importantly, to study the effects of these factors on the
propagation of undular bores, which are essentially unsteady in the system
under consideration. In particular, it is shown that the combined action of
variable topography and bottom friction generally imposes certain global
restrictions on the undular bore propagation so that the evolution of the
leading solitary wave can be substantially different from that of an isolated
solitary wave with the same initial amplitude. This non-local effect is due to
nonlinear wave interactions within the undular bore and can lead to an
additional solitary wave amplitude growth, which cannot be predicted in the

a difficult problem of non-destructive testing. This article describes an
intelligent acoustic emission source locator. The intelligent locator comprises
a sensor antenna and a general regression neural network, which solves the
location problem based on learning from examples. Locator performance was
tested on different test specimens. Tests have shown that the accuracy of
location depends on sound velocity and attenuation in the specimen, the
dimensions of the tested area, and the properties of stored data. The location
accuracy achieved by the intelligent locator is comparable to that obtained by
the conventional triangulation method, while the applicability of the
intelligent locator is more general since analysis of sonic ray paths is
avoided. This is a promising method for non-destructive testing of aircraft
frame structures by the acoustic emission method.

globally and several new results are obtained. As a by-product, interesting
identities and properties concerning the torsion tensor fields and the
curvature tensor fields are deduced. Although our investigation is entirely

theory. The bonding in the potassium-graphite compound is reasonably well
accounted for by traditional semilocal density functional theory (DFT)
calculations. However, to investigate the intercalate formation energy from
pure potassium atoms and graphite requires use of a description of the graphite
interlayer binding and thus a consistent account of the nonlocal dispersive
interactions. This is included seamlessly with ordinary DFT by a van der Waals
density functional (vdW-DF) approach [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 246401 (2004)]. The
use of the vdW-DF is found to stabilize the graphite crystal, with crystal
parameters in fair agreement with experiments. For graphite and
potassium-intercalated graphite structural parameters such as binding
separation, layer binding energy, formation energy, and bulk modulus are
reported. Also the adsorption and sub-surface potassium absorption energies are
reported. The vdW-DF description, compared with the traditional semilocal
approach, is found to weakly soften the elastic response.
","But the main thing is to understand how the interaction between potassium and graphite can be tuned by adjusting the voltage in the structure, which is essential to the development of better electrolytes. Then, we analyzed the electronic structure of the graphite, which revealed that the intercalation of potassium enhances the electronic properties of the graphite and brings charges to the surface of the graphite. The interaction between the two layers is strongly influenced by the orientation of the atoms, and the angle of 001 is the most effective orientation of the atoms. This result confirmed the validity of the van der Waals density-functional analysis, which was of a more useful use for the design of new electrochemical devices. We examined the intercalation of potassium with graphite using the density-functional approach of van der Waals. The study aimed at determining the optimal voltage at which the intercalation occurs. We found that the optimal voltage was about 2.5V, and that the intercalation of potassium was stronger than the interlayer adsorption.

an orbit indistinguishable from circular, $e=0.012 \pm 0.021$. We demonstrate
generally that the surface gravity of the secondary star in a single-lined
binary undergoing total eclipses can be derived from characteristics of the
light curve and spectroscopic orbit. This constrains the secondary to a unique
line in the mass-radius diagram with $M/R^2$ = constant. For HAT-TR-205-013, we
assume the orbit has been tidally circularized, and that the primary's rotation
has been synchronized and aligned with the orbital axis. Our observed line
broadening, $V_{\rm rot} \sin i_{\rm rot} = 28.9 \pm 1.0$ \kms, gives a primary
radius of $R_{\rm A} = 1.28 \pm 0.04$ \rsun. Our light curve analysis leads to
the radius of the secondary, $R_{\rm B} = 0.167 \pm 0.006$ \rsun, and the

of free (scalar, spinor and vector) fields are considered from mathematical
view-point. As sources of these relations are employed the Heisenberg
equations/relations for the dynamical variables and a specific condition for
uniqueness of the operators of the dynamical variables (with respect to some
class of Lagrangians). The paracommutation relations or some their
generalizations are pointed as the most general ones that entail the validity
of all Heisenberg equations. The simultaneous fulfillment of the Heisenberg
equations and the uniqueness requirement turn to be impossible. This problem is
solved via a redefinition of the dynamical variables, similar to the normal
ordering procedure and containing it as a special case. That implies
corresponding changes in the admissible commutation relations. The introduction
of the concept of the vacuum makes narrow the class of the possible commutation
relations; in particular, the mentioned redefinition of the dynamical variables
is reduced to normal ordering. As a last restriction on that class is imposed
the requirement for existing of an effective procedure for calculating vacuum
mean values. The standard bilinear commutation relations are pointed as the
only known ones that satisfy all of the mentioned conditions and do not
contradict to the existing data.
","He also demonstrates that the operators of the free field are obeying fundamental commutation rules, which are crucial in quantum mechanics. These results, and in particular the behavior of the free fields, are significant. The study is based on the Lagrangian theory of the free field, which deals with the free fields and their properties. To study these properties, we use the framework of the LQFT and a Fourier transformation of the fields, which allows us to calculate the commutation relation between the annihilation and creation operators, by means of the Hamiltonian and the field equations. In this research, we are mainly concerned with the free field and the commutation relation. The main question we are concerned with is the lack of a clear understanding of the operators that describe the fields and their properties. This is especially the case for the free field, in which the operator explains the fundamental commutation rules, which are crucial to quantum mechanics.

nanostructured optoelectronic and electronic devices such as lasers,
photodetectors and nanoscale logic. Spatial order and size order of SAQDs are
important to the development of usable devices. It is likely that these two
types of order are strongly linked; thus, a study of spatial order will also
have strong implications for size order. Here a study of spatial order is
undertaken using a linear analysis of a commonly used model of SAQD formation
based on surface diffusion. Analytic formulas for film-height correlation
functions are found that characterize quantum dot spatial order and
corresponding correlation lengths that quantify order. Initial atomic-scale
random fluctuations result in relatively small correlation lengths (about two
dots) when the effect of a wetting potential is negligible; however, the
correlation lengths diverge when SAQDs are allowed to form at a near-critical
film height. The present work reinforces previous findings about anisotropy and
SAQD order and presents as explicit and transparent mechanism for ordering with
corresponding analytic equations. In addition, SAQD formation is by its nature
a stochastic process, and various mathematical aspects regarding statistical
analysis of SAQD formation and order are presented.
","In this work, we present a mathematical model to determine the order and spacing of QDs during the epitaxial growth process. We have shown that, if the density, the growth rate and the ratio of the nucleation to the diffusion constants greatly influences the order of QDs, the spacing of which is necessary for the formation of atoms.

We take into account the effects of the surface diffusion coefficient, the nucleation rate, and the ratio of the nucleation rate to the diffusion constant, which significantly influence the ordering of the QDs in the growth process.

necessarily invertible) smooth self map of a compact manifold. We prove a
result that takes advantage of differences in rates of expansion in the terms
of a sheaf cohomological long exact sequence to create unique lifts of finite
dimensional invariant subspaces of one term of the sequence to invariant
subspaces of the preceding term. This allows us to take invariant cohomological
classes and under the right circumstances construct unique currents of a given
type, including unique measures of a given type, that represent those classes
and are invariant under pullback. A dynamically interesting self map may have a
plethora of invariant measures, so the uniquess of the constructed currents is
important. It means that if local growth is not too big compared to the growth
rate of the cohomological class then the expanding cohomological class gives
sufficient ""marching orders"" to the system to prohibit the formation of any
other such invariant current of the same type (say from some local dynamical
subsystem). Because we use subsheaves of the sheaf of currents we give
conditions under which a subsheaf will have the same cohomology as the sheaf
containing it. Using a smoothing argument this allows us to show that the sheaf
cohomology of the currents under consideration can be canonically identified
with the deRham cohomology groups. Our main theorem can be applied in both the
smooth and holomorphic setting.
","This research is an attempt to understand the behavior of dynamic systems and to develop new methods of studying them. Moreover, these currents have the potential to be useful in many fields, from data analysis to machine learning and physics. The main idea is to use cohomology, a powerful tool of algebraic topology, in order to construct dynamic objects that resemble the behavior of the cohomologically expanding maps. In this work, we propose to make use of the concept of cohomology, a powerful and powerful tool for the study of the behavior of concentric networks.

depends on cluster half-mass density (rho_h) in the sense that the turnover
mass M_TO increases with rho_h while the width of the GCMF decreases. We argue
that this is the expected signature of the slow erosion of a mass function that
initially rose towards low masses, predominantly through cluster evaporation
driven by internal two-body relaxation. We find excellent agreement between the
observed GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, central
concentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model in
which the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by
-dM/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1/2}. In particular, we recover the well-known
insensitivity of M_TO to r_gc. This feature does not derive from a literal
``universality'' of the GCMF turnover mass, but rather from a significant
variation of M_TO with rho_h -- the expected outcome of relaxation-driven
cluster disruption -- plus significant scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc.
Our conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are assumed to depend
instead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidal
radii, as mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1/2} or mu_ev ~ Sigma_t^{3/4} -- alternative
prescriptions that are physically motivated but involve cluster properties
(rho_t and Sigma_t) that are not as well defined or as readily observable as
rho_h. In all cases, the normalization of mu_ev required to fit the GCMF
implies cluster lifetimes that are within the range of standard values
(although falling towards the low end of this range). Our analysis does not
depend on any assumptions or information about velocity anisotropy in the
globular cluster system.

resulting soliton solutions can be regarded as a generalization of those under
vanishing boundary conditions. One-soliton solutions are derived in an explicit
manner. According to the behaviors at the infinity, they are classified into
two kinds, domain-wall (DW) type and phase-shift (PS) type. The DW-type implies
the ferromagnetic state with nonzero total spin and the PS-type implies the
polar state, where the total spin amounts to zero. We also discuss two-soliton
collisions. In particular, the spin-mixing phenomenon is confirmed in a
collision involving the DW-type. The results are consistent with those of the

clustering of particles in a freely cooling dilute granular gas. We consider
large-scale hydrodynamic motions where the viscosity and heat conduction can be
neglected, and one arrives at the equations of ideal gas dynamics with an
additional term describing bulk energy losses due to inelastic collisions. We
employ Lagrangian coordinates and derive a broad family of exact non-stationary
analytical solutions that depend only on one spatial coordinate. These
solutions exhibit a new type of singularity, where the gas density blows up in
a finite time when starting from smooth initial conditions. The density blowups
signal formation of close-packed clusters of particles. As the density blow-up
time $t_c$ is approached, the maximum density exhibits a power law $\sim
(t_c-t)^{-2}$. The velocity gradient blows up as $\sim - (t_c-t)^{-1}$ while
the velocity itself remains continuous and develops a cusp (rather than a shock
discontinuity) at the singularity. The gas temperature vanishes at the
singularity, and the singularity follows the isobaric scenario: the gas
pressure remains finite and approximately uniform in space and constant in time
close to the singularity. An additional exact solution shows that the density
blowup, of the same type, may coexist with an ""ordinary"" shock, at which the
hydrodynamic fields are discontinuous but finite. We confirm stability of the
exact solutions with respect to small one-dimensional perturbations by solving
the ideal hydrodynamic equations numerically. Furthermore, numerical solutions
show that the local features of the density blowup hold universally,
independently of details of the initial and boundary conditions.

space-time lagrangian density evaluated on a restricted set of field
configurations, called universal sector, turns out to be same around all the
pp-waves, even off-shell, with same transverse space and same profiles for the
background scalars. In this paper we restrict our discussion to tensorial
fields only. In the context of bosonic string theory we consider on-shell
pp-waves and argue that universality requires the existence of a universal
sector of world-sheet operators whose correlation functions are insensitive to
the pp-wave nature of the metric and the background gauge flux. Such results
can also be reproduced using the world-sheet conformal field theory. We also
study such pp-waves in non-polynomial closed string field theory (CSFT). In
particular, we argue that for an off-shell pp-wave ansatz with flat transverse
space and dilaton independent of transverse coordinates the field redefinition
relating the low energy effective field theory and CSFT with all the massive
modes integrated out is at most quadratic in fields. Because of this
simplification it is expected that the off-shell pp-waves can be identified on
the two sides. Furthermore, given the massless pp-wave field configurations, an
iterative method for computing the higher massive modes using the CSFT
equations of motion has been discussed. All our bosonic string theory analyses
can be generalised to the common Neveu-Schwarz sector of superstrings.

proposed method is demonstrated by the modeling of a return map of noisy
chaotic data. In this example, the nonparametric regression is used to predict
a future value of chaotic time series from the present one. The mean predictor
error is used in the definition of predictor quality, while the redundancy is
expressed by the mean square distance between data points. Both statistics are
used in a new definition of predictor cost function. From the minimum of the
predictor cost function, a proper number of data in the model is estimated.
","Our work has become a significant step in the development of a new way of estimating the behavior of physical systems. We believe that this method can be a useful tool for enhancing the accuracy of physical models, a more accurate prediction of them, and a more accurate decision. Our research is concerned with developing a new method for the estimation of physical laws by nonparametric regression. We use modern statistical tools, such as Bayesian inference, cross-validation, and regularization, to make sure that our data are well chosen and stable. In the case of heat, fluids, and quantum mechanics, we have shown that nonparametric regression can provide accurate predictions and reveal complex structures that may not be captured by linear models. Our method is based on the flexibility and power of nonparametric regression, which allows us to simulate complex relationships without limiting the number of parameters. In our study, we developed a general method of estimating physical laws and its functions, using a nonparametric approach, which is more flexible and a more powerful approach.

with V_{DM}=3000km/s, and the ""bullet"" X-ray gas can move with
V_{gas}=4200km/s. These are nearly the {\it maximum speeds} that are
accelerable by the gravity of two truncated CDM halos in a Hubble time even
without the ram pressure. Consistency breaks down if one adopts higher end of
the error bars for the bullet gas speed (5000-5400km/s), and the bullet gas
would not be bound by the sub-cluster halo for the Hubble time. Models with
V_{DM}~ 4500km/s ~ V_{gas} would invoke unrealistic large amount M_{CDM}=7x

$4500\kms$ is easily obtained in the relativistic MONDian lensing model of
Angus et al. (2007). However, MONDian model with little hot dark matter
$M_{HDM} \le 0.6\times 10^{15}\msun$ and CDM model with a small halo mass $\le

","The study revealed that the collision was a recent one, with the bullets traveling at a speed of almost 4700 mph. This collision was in fact the first time, and the bullets, in the course of the collision, were not able to slow down.

the nanodot size increases from 52 nm to 67 nm, the FORC diagrams reveal

distribution extracted from the FORC distribution agrees well with a
calculation based on the measured nanodot size distribution. The 58 and 67 nm
nanodots exhibit vortex states, where the nucleation and annihilation of the
vortices are manifested as butterfly-like features in the FORC distribution and
confirmed by micromagnetic simulations. Furthermore, the FORC method gives
quantitative measures of the magnetic phase fractions, and vortex nucleation

necessary for a fading source.

nearly extremal Kerr black hole. For very rapidly rotating black holes (spin
a=J/M>0.9524M) we have found a class of very strong field eccentric orbits
whose angular momentum L_z increases with the orbit's inclination with respect
to the equatorial plane, while keeping latus rectum and eccentricity fixed.
This behavior is in contrast with Newtonian intuition, and is in fact opposite
to the ""normal"" behavior of black hole orbits. Such behavior was noted
previously for circular orbits; since it only applies to orbits very close to
the black hole, they were named ""nearly horizon-skimming orbits"". Our analysis
generalizes this result, mapping out the full generic (inclined and eccentric)
family of nearly horizon-skimming orbits. The earlier work on circular orbits
reported that, under gravitational radiation emission, nearly horizon-skimming
orbits tend to evolve to smaller orbit inclination, toward prograde equatorial
configuration. Normal orbits, by contrast, always demonstrate slowly growing
orbit inclination (orbits evolve toward the retrograde equatorial
configuration). Using up-to-date Teukolsky-fluxes, we have concluded that the
earlier result was incorrect: all circular orbits, including nearly
horizon-skimming ones, exhibit growing orbit inclination. Using kludge fluxes
based on a Post-Newtonian expansion corrected with fits to circular and to
equatorial Teukolsky-fluxes, we argue that the inclination grows also for
eccentric nearly horizon-skimming orbits. We also find that the inclination
change is, in any case, very small. As such, we conclude that these orbits are
not likely to have a clear and peculiar imprint on the gravitational waveforms
expected to be measured by the space-based detector LISA.
","Moreover, it has been shown that circular orbits are often subject to a resemblance to a resemblance to the horizon, and, consequently, that they are capable of a considerable decomposition due to the gravity that arouses them. These resemblances are not only distorted, but also can be dissipated by the motion of the frame, which may be of particular importance for accretion disks. In our work we examine the behavior of nearly horizon-stiff orbits in the Kerr time, both in circular and non-circular shapes, and in their elliptic and equilateral shapes. This study has a unified purpose, and it is of great importance to the understanding of the black hole and the accretion processes. Then we proceed to a numerical simulation of the particles around a Kerr black hole, using a modified version of the geodesic equation. We first investigate the behavior of circular orbits as they approach the horizon, then we investigate the effect of inclination and eccentricity, and then proceed to non-circular orbits as well, by applying a modified version of the geodesic equation.

with a vortex can be parameterized by the circulation $\Gamma=\oint {\rm d}{\bf

fluid velocity field. While classical vortices can take any value of
circulation, superfluids are irrotational, and any rotation or angular momentum
is constrained to occur through vortices with quantized circulation. Quantized
vortices also play a key role in the dissipation of transport in superfluids.
In BECs quantized vortices have been observed in several forms, including
single vortices, vortex lattices, and vortex pairs and rings. The recent
observation of quantized vortices in a fermionic gas was taken as a clear
signature of the underlying condensation and superfluidity of fermion pairs. In

semiconductor quantum dots are investigated from equation-of-motion approach
for different magnetic fields, quantum dot sizes, and temperatures. Various
mechanisms, such as the hyperfine interaction with the surrounding nuclei, the
Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling together with the electron--bulk-phonon
interaction, the $g$-factor fluctuations, the direct spin-phonon coupling due
to the phonon-induced strain, and the coaction of the
electron--bulk/surface-phonon interaction together with the hyperfine
interaction are included. The relative contributions from these spin
decoherence mechanisms are compared in detail. In our calculation, the
spin-orbit coupling is included in each mechanism and is shown to have marked
effect in most cases. The equation-of-motion approach is applied in studying
both the spin relaxation time $T_1$ and the spin dephasing time $T_2$, either
in Markovian or in non-Markovian limit. When many levels are involved at finite
temperature, we demonstrate how to obtain the spin relaxation time from the
Fermi Golden rule in the limit of weak spin-orbit coupling. However, at high
temperature and/or for large spin-orbit coupling, one has to use the
equation-of-motion approach when many levels are involved. Moreover, spin
dephasing can be much more efficient than spin relaxation at high temperature,
though the two only differs by a factor of two at low temperature.
","As the present study shows, spin-based quantum-dots have shown great promise in the field of quantum information processing, scalability, and speed, but the coherence of these systems is not fully understood. The results are thus obtained by examining the dynamics of the spheres of a semiconductor. In this study we have examined the dynamics of the sphere of a semiconductor, a semiconductor, a quantum-dot, a sphere of a very long scale, which is unable to retain the coherence of the sphere. The sphere of a sphere is in a sense a system in which quantum information is stored, and the communication between them is possible. The main idea is to systematically examine the dynamics of the sphere of a semiconductor, by a new equation of motion. Then we will apply this knowledge to the theory of spin decomposition in the sphere of a quantum-dot, which will provide a new model for the theory of spin decomposition, and to show how to calculate and control the sphere of a sphere.

invoked to study the properties of the system in the ground state, while the
transfer matrix renormalization group (TMRG) technique is applied to explore
the thermodynamic properties. The local magnetic moments, spin correlation
functions, and static structure factors are discussed in the ground state for
the three cases. It is shown that the static structure factor S(q) shows peaks
at wavevectors $q=a\pi /3$ (a=0,1,2,3,4,5) for different couplings in a zero
magnetic field, which, however in the magnetic fields where the magnetization
plateau with m=1/6 pertains, exhibits the peaks only at q=0, $2\pi /3$ and
$4\pi /3$, which are found to be couplings-independent. The DMRG results of the
zero-field static structure factor can be nicely fitted by a linear
superposition of six modes, where two fitting equations are proposed. It is
observed that the six modes are closely related to the low-lying excitations of
the system. At finite temperatures, the double-peak structures of the
susceptibility and specific heat against temperature are obtained, where the
peak positions and heights are found to depend on the competition of the
couplings. It is also uncovered that the XXZ anisotropy of F and AF couplings
leads the system of case (c) to display quite different behaviors. In addition,
the experimental data of the susceptibility, specific heat and magnetization
for the compound Cu$_{3}$(CO$_{3}$)$_{2}$(OH)$_{2}$ are fairly compared with
our TMRG results.

With the number of experiments the redundancy on average increases, while the
experimental information converges to a certain limit value. The difference
between this limit value and the experimental information at a finite number of

foliation on $M$, with isolated singularities of Morse type. The study and
classification of pairs $(M,\F)$ is a challenging (and difficult) problem. In
this setting, a classical result due to Reeb \cite{Reeb} states that a manifold
admitting a foliation with exactly two center-type singularities is a sphere.
In particular this is true if the foliation is given by a function. Along these
lines a result due to Eells and Kuiper \cite{Ku-Ee} classify manifolds having a
real-valued function admitting exactly three non-degenerate singular points. In
the present paper, we prove a generalization of the above mentioned results. To
do this, we first describe the possible arrangements of pairs of singularities
and the corresponding codimension one invariant sets, and then we give an
elimination procedure for suitable center-saddle and some saddle-saddle
configurations (of consecutive indices). In the second part, we investigate if
other classical results, such as Haefliger and Novikov (Compact Leaf) theorems,
proved for regular foliations, still hold true in presence of singularities. At
this purpose, in the singular set, $Sing(\F)$ of the foliation $\F$, we
consider {\em{weakly stable}} components, that we define as those components
admitting a neighborhood where all leaves are compact. If $Sing(\F)$ admits
only weakly stable components, given by smoothly embedded curves diffeomorphic
to $S^1$, we are able to extend Haefliger's theorem. Finally, the existence of
a closed curve, transverse to the foliation, leads us to state a Novikov-type
result.

Reparametrization Invariance proves appropriate to understand those issues. We
show that some Standard Model inspired parametrizations can be senseless or
inadequate if they go beyond the minimal Gronau and London assumptions: the
single weak phase $\alpha$ just in the $\Delta I=3/2$ amplitudes, the isospin
relations and experimental data. Beside those analyses, we extract $\alpha$
through the use of several adequate parametrizations, showing that there is no
relevant discrepancy between frequentist and bayesian results. The most
relevant information, in terms of $\alpha$, is the exclusion of values around
$\alpha\sim \pi/4$; this result is valid in the presence of arbitrary New
Physics contributions to the $\Delta I=1/2$ piece.

mainly determined by the tail of the transmission peak contributed unusually by
the perturbed lowest perturbed unoccupied molecular orbital. The calculated

the two quasars whose intergalactic HeII forest has been resolved with FUSE. By
analysing the HI and the HeII opacity variations separately, no transverse
proximity effect is detected near three foreground quasars of HE2347-4342:
QSOJ23503-4328 (z=2.282, $\vartheta=3.59$ arcmin), QSOJ23500-4319 (z=2.302,
$\vartheta=8.77$ arcmin) and QSOJ23495-4338 (z=2.690, $\vartheta=16.28$
arcmin). This is primarily due to line contamination and overdensities probably
created by large-scale structure. By comparing the HI absorption and the
corresponding HeII absorption, we estimated the fluctuating spectral shape of
the extragalactic UV radiation field along this line of sight. We find that the
UV spectral shape near HE2347-4342 and in the projected vicinity of the three
foreground quasars is statistically harder than expected from UV background
models dominated by quasars. In addition, we find three highly ionised metal
line systems near the quasars. However, they do not yield further constraints
on the shape of the ionising field. We conclude that the foreground quasars
show a transverse proximity effect that is detectable as a local hardening of
the UV radiation field, although the evidence is strongest for QSOJ23495-4338.
Thus, the relative spectral hardness traces the proximity effect also in
overdense regions prohibiting the traditional detection in the HI forest.
Furthermore, we emphasise that softening of quasar radiation by radiative
transfer in the intergalactic medium is important to understand the observed
spectral shape variations. From the transverse proximity effect of
QSOJ23495-4338 we obtain a lower limit on the quasar lifetime of ~25 Myr.
","The transverse effect, which we call transverse absorption, is a phenomenon that may be useful for studying the gas in the intergalactic medium, the influence of nearby galaxies on its evolution. The transverse effect of a galaxies is a peculiar effect which can be used to study the gas in the intergalactic medium and its effects on the evolution of the gas. The effect of a galaxies is, as it were, an extremely small one, but the effect of a galaxies is still unknown.

non-zero D-classes. They are submonoids of the multiplicative part of the Cuntz

We propose to investigate the relationship between the monoid generalizations and other known monoid structures, thereby enabling us to study them more thoroughly. In order to make a new and more generalisation of these groups, we introduce generalized Thompson monoids. We obtain a monoidal form of these monoids by transforming the group operations of the groups into monoid forms, and find several properties of these monoids, such as their finite generation and their finitely presentedness. We also show that the isomorphism problem for these monoids is decidable, so that we can use this property to distinguish between different generalized Thompson monoids.

complex knot discovered to date in human ubiquitin hydrolase, and suggest that
its entangled topology protects it against unfolding and degradation by the
proteasome. Knots in proteins are typically preserved across species and
sometimes even across kingdoms. However, we also identify a knot which only
appears in some transcarbamylases while being absent in homologous proteins of
similar structure. The emergence of the knot is accompanied by a shift in the
enzymatic function of the protein. We suggest that the simple insertion of a
short DNA fragment into the gene may suffice to turn an unknotted into a
knotted structure in this protein.

The SET plays a role of the fluctuating environment affecting the qubit's

Solving these equation we obtain decoherence and relaxation rates of the qubit,
as well as the spectral density of the fluctuating qubit's parameters. We found
that in the weak coupling regime the decoherence and relaxation rates are
directly related to the spectral density taken at Rabi or at zero frequency,
depending on what a particular qubit's parameters is fluctuating. This relation
holds also in the presence of weak back-action of the qubit on the fluctuating
environment. In the case of strong back-action, such simple relationship no
longer holds, even if the qubit-SET coupling is small. It does not hold either
in the strong-coupling regime, even in the absence of the back-action. In
addition, we found that our model predicts localization of the qubit in the
strong-coupling regime, resembling that of the spin-boson model.

This equation gives us an account of the state of the particles in the world and of the surrounding environment, and of the state of the coherence. We find that the coherence of the system is most strongly influenced by the spectral density of the environment, and its low-frequency modes, and this is the most important influence on the coherence of the system.

for networks with connectivity two and non-uniform probabilities for the

out that in these cases Lynch's parameter $\lambda$ is equivalent to the
expectation of average sensitivity of the Boolean functions used to construct
the network. Hence we can apply a known theorem for the expectation of the
average sensitivity. In order to prove the results for networks with biased
functions, we deduct the expectation of the average sensitivity when only
functions with specific connectivity and specific bias are chosen at random.

somewhat different language. We explain how to extract the type $B_n$

all known enumerative results on ordinary and generalised non-crossing

accounting statistically for unidentified diskless members. Our Spitzer census
of IC 348 reveals a population of protostars that is anti-correlated spatially
with the T-Tauri members, which comprise the centrally condensed cluster around
a B star. The protostars are instead found mostly at the cluster periphery
about 1 pc from the B star and spread out along a filamentary ridge. We find
that the star formation rate in this protostellar ridge is consistent with that
rate which built the exposed cluster while the presence of fifteen cold,
starless, millimeter cores intermingled with this protostellar population
indicates that the IC 348 nebula has yet to finish forming stars. We show that
the IC 348 cluster is of order 3-5 crossing times old, and, as evidenced by its
smooth radial profile and confirmed mass segregation, is likely relaxed. While
it seems apparent that the current cluster configuration is the result of
dynamical evolution and its primordial structure has been erased, our findings
support a model where embedded clusters are built up from numerous smaller
sub-clusters. Finally, the results of our Spitzer census indicate that the

activates the strongest channel modes. Here we analyze the performance of
Random Vector Quantization (RVQ), in which the precoding matrix is selected
from a random codebook containing independent, isotropically distributed
entries. We assume that channel elements are i.i.d. and known to the receiver,
which relays the optimal (rate-maximizing) precoder codebook index to the
transmitter using B bits. We first derive the large system capacity of
beamforming (rank-one precoding matrix) as a function of B, where large system
refers to the limit as B and the number of transmit and receive antennas all go
to infinity with fixed ratios. With beamforming RVQ is asymptotically optimal,
i.e., no other quantization scheme can achieve a larger asymptotic rate. The
performance of RVQ is also compared with that of a simpler reduced-rank scalar
quantization scheme in which the beamformer is constrained to lie in a random
subspace. We subsequently consider a precoding matrix with arbitrary rank, and
approximate the asymptotic RVQ performance with optimal and linear receivers
(matched filter and Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE)). Numerical examples show
that these approximations accurately predict the performance of finite-size
systems of interest. Given a target spectral efficiency, numerical examples
show that the amount of feedback required by the linear MMSE receiver is only
slightly more than that required by the optimal receiver, whereas the matched
filter can require significantly more feedback.

observational results, we test if G328.4+0.2 is a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) or a
large PWN inside a supernova remnant (SNR) using a simple hydrodynamic model
for the evolution of a PWN inside a SNR. As a result of this analysis, we
conclude that G328.4+0.2 is a young (< 10000 years old) pulsar wind nebula
formed by a low magnetic field (<10^12 G) neutron star born spinning rapidly
(<10 ms) expanding into an undetected SNR formed by an energetic (>10^51 ergs),
low ejecta mass (M < 5 Solar Masses) supernova explosion which occurred in a
low density (n~0.03 cm^{-3}) environment.
","This is a comprehensive investigation of the PWN, and its neutron stars, and the supernova that erupts in it. Our work is a combined effort to examine the complex physics of PWNs, neutron stars, and supernovae in general. We show that the morphology and the spectral index of PWN is consistent with an expanding PWN, and that the central neutron star is extremely complex, which is due to the non-thermal nature of the X-rays. Our results provide new insights into the physics of PWNs, and their associated neutron stars. Then, we analyzed G328.4 and G328.0.2 and their respective neutron stars. We investigated the spectral and spectral morphology and the spectral index of the PWN. Our X-ray spectral properties of the PWN and its central neutron star are highly variable, which indicates that it is a star which is constantly rotating, with a high magnetic field. In conclusion, we developed a numerical simulation of the supernova explosion which produced G328.4 and G328. We present an analysis of the PWN G328.4 and its neutron star, the luminous pulsar nebula, and its progenitor supernova.

central Au+Au collisions relative to $pp$, d+Au and peripheral Au+Au

angle gluon radiation, jets deflected by transverse flow, path length dependent
energy loss, Cerenkov gluon radiation of fast moving particles, and conical
flow generated by hydrodynamic Mach-cone shock-waves. Three-particle
correlations have the power to distinguish the scenarios with conical emission,
conical flow and Cerenkov radiation, from other scenarios. In addition, the
dependence of the observed shapes on the $p_T$ of the associated particles can
be used to distinguish conical emission from a sonic boom (Mach-cone) and from
QCD-Cerenkov radiation. We present results from STAR on 3-particle azimuthal
correlations for a high $p_T$ trigger particle with two softer particles.
Results are shown for $pp$, d+Au and high statistics Au+Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200 GeV. An important aspect of the analysis is the subtraction
of combinatorial backgrounds. Systematic uncertainties due to this subtraction
and the flow harmonics v2 and v4 are investigated in detail. The implications
of the results for the presence or absence of conical flow from Mach-cones are
discussed.
","We therefore have the objective of studying the underlying dynamics of heavy-ion collisions at a constant epoch. The aim of this research is to understand the fundamental nature of collisions at the epoch when the jets are not reconstituted and to elucidate the formation of a plasma. The main idea of this study is to investigate three-particle correlations in Au+Au collisions at a epoch of sNN=200 GeV. We first identify three particles of the same charge, and we calculate the corresponding correlations for different angles of the epoch. These corresponding correlations are, in our opinion, more in keeping with the prevailing assumption of the jets fragmentation and flow. The result is that the three-particle correlations are largely consistent with the expectation of the jets fragmentation and the water flow, but there are some differences in the epoch. This deviation may be due to the presence of additional effects such as magnetic fields or nonlinear hydrodynamics.

approach to the P vs. NP and related problems through algebraic geometry and
representation theory. The basic principle behind this approach is called the
flip. In essence, it reduces the negative hypothesis in complexity theory (the
lower bound problems), such as the P vs. NP problem in characteristic zero, to
the positive hypothesis in complexity theory (the upper bound problems):
specifically, to showing that the problems of deciding nonvanishing of the
fundamental structural constants in representation theory and algebraic
geometry, such as the well known plethysm constants--or rather certain relaxed
forms of these decision probelms--belong to the complexity class P. In this
article, we suggest a plan for implementing the flip, i.e., for showing that
these relaxed decision problems belong to P. This is based on the reduction of
the preceding complexity-theoretic positive hypotheses to mathematical
positivity hypotheses: specifically, to showing that there exist positive
formulae--i.e. formulae with nonnegative coefficients--for the structural
constants under consideration and certain functions associated with them. These
turn out be intimately related to the similar positivity properties of the
Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and the multiplicative structural constants of the
canonical (global crystal) bases in the theory of Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum
groups. The known proofs of these positivity properties depend on the Riemann
hypothesis over finite fields and the related results. Thus the reduction here,
in conjunction with the flip, in essence, says that the validity of the P vs.
NP conjecture in characteristic zero is intimately linked to the Riemann
hypothesis over finite fields and related problems.

observations of two candidate V-type asteroids, (7472) Kumakiri and (10537)
1991 RY16, located in the outer Main Belt (a > 2.85 UA). These candidate have
been previously identified by Roig and Gil-Hutton (2006, Icarus 183, 411) using
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey colors. The spectroscopic observations have been
obtained at the Calar Alto Observatory, Spain, during observational runs in
November and December 2006. The spectra of these two asteroids show the steep
slope shortwards of 0.70 microns and the deep absorption feature longwards of
0.75 microns that are characteristic of V-type asteroids. However, the presence
of a shallow but conspicuous absorption band around 0.65 microns opens some
questions about the actual mineralogy of these two asteroids. Such band has
never been observed before in basaltic asteroids with the intensity we detected
it. We discuss the possibility for this shallow absorption feature to be caused
by the presence of chromium on the asteroid surface. Our results indicate that,

mass sensitivity at 1 AU. An upgrade of the VLBA bandwidth will increase
astrometric accuracy by an order of magnitude. Ultimately, the colossal
collecting area of the Square Kilometer Array could push astrometric accuracy
to 1 microarcsecond, making detection and characterizaiton of Earth mass

space of astrometric searches gives greater sensitivity to planets at large
radii than radial velocity searches. For the VLBA and the expanded VLBA, the
targets of radio astrometric surveys are by necessity nearby, low-mass, active
stars, which cannot be studied efficiently through the radial velocity method,
coronagraphy, or optical interferometry. For the SKA, detection sensitivity
will extend to solar-type stars. Planets discovered through radio astrometric
methods will be suitable for characterization through extreme adaptive optics.

is to use anisotropic {\it transformation media} whose permittivity and
permeability $\var^{\lambda\nu}, \mu^{\lambda\nu}$, are obtained from the ones,
$\var_0^{\lambda\nu}, \mu^{\lambda\nu}_0$, of isotropic media, by singular
transformations of coordinates. In this paper we study electromagnetic cloaking
in the time-domain using the formalism of time-dependent scattering theory.
This formalism allows us to settle in an unambiguous way the mathematical
problems posed by the singularities of the inverse of the permittivity and the
permeability of the {\it transformation media} on the boundary of the cloaked
objects. We write Maxwell's equations in Schr\""odinger form with the
electromagnetic propagator playing the role of the Hamiltonian. We prove that
the electromagnetic propagator outside of the cloaked objects is essentially
self-adjoint. Moreover, the unique self-adjoint extension is unitarily
equivalent to the electromagnetic propagator in the medium
$\var_0^{\lambda\nu}, \mu^{\lambda\nu}_0$. Using this fact, and since the
coordinate transformation is the identity outside of a ball, we prove that the
scattering operator is the identity. Our results give a rigorous proof that the
construction of \cite{glu1, glu2, le}, \cite{pss1} perfectly cloaks passive and
active devices from observation by electromagnetic waves. Furthermore, we prove
cloaking for general anisotropic materials. In particular, our results prove
that it is possible to cloak objects inside general crystals.

better KBO statistics and more comprehensive calculations, the data are broadly
consistent with KBO formation in a massive disk followed by substantial
collisional grinding and dynamical ejection. However, there are important
problems reconciling the results of coagulation and dynamical calculations.
Contrasting our current understanding of the evolution of KBOs and asteroids
suggests that additional observational constraints, such as the identification
of more dynamical families of KBOs (like the 2003 EL61 family), would provide
additional information on the relative roles of collisional grinding and
dynamical ejection in the Kuiper Belt. The uncertainties also motivate
calculations that combine collisional and dynamical evolution, a `unified'
calculation that should give us a better picture of KBO formation and

lensing, and optical observations with numerical simulations of the merging
galaxy cluster 1E0657-56. X-ray observations reveal a bullet-like subcluster
with a prominent bow shock, while lensing results show that the positions of
the total mass peaks are consistent with the centroids of the collisionless
galaxies (and inconsistent with the X-ray brightness peaks). Previous studies,
based on older observational datasets, have placed upper limits on the
self-interaction cross-section of dark matter per unit mass, sigma/m, using
simplified analytic techniques. In this work, we take advantage of new,
higher-quality observational datasets by running N-body simulations of
1E0657-56 that include the effects of self-interacting dark matter, and
comparing the results with observations. Furthermore, the recent data allow for
a new independent method of constraining sigma/m, based on the non-observation
of an offset between the bullet subcluster mass peak and galaxy centroid. This
new method places an upper limit (68% confidence) of sigma/m < 1.25 cm^2/g. If
we make the assumption that the subcluster and the main cluster had equal
mass-to-light ratios prior to the merger, we derive our most stringent
constraint of sigma/m < 0.7 cm^2/g, which comes from the consistency of the
subcluster's observed mass-to-light ratio with the main cluster's, and with the
universal cluster value, ruling out the possibility of a large fraction of dark
matter particles being scattered away due to collisions. Our limit is a slight
improvement over the previous result from analytic estimates, and rules out
most of the 0.5 - 5cm^2/g range invoked to explain inconsistencies between the
standard collisionless cold dark matter model and observations.

2155-304 was observed from May to December 2005. The wavelength interval
explored, the total number of photometric points and the short integration time
render our photometry substantially superior to previous ones for this source.
On the basis of the intensity and colour we distinguish three different states
of the source, each of duration of months, which include all those described in
the literature. In particular, we report the highest state ever detected in the
H band. The source varied by a factor of 4 in this band, much more than in the
V band (a factor ~2). The source softened with increasing intensity, contrary
to the general pattern observed in the UV-X-ray bands. On five nights of
November we had nearly continuous monitoring for 2-3 hours. A variability
episode with a time scale of ~24 h is well documented, a much more rapid flare
with t=1-2 h, is also apparent, but is supported by relatively few points.

dereddened spectrum of A0620-00 in K exceed the A0620-00 spectrum in J and H
for all stars of spectral type K7V or earlier, demonstrating that the donor
star, unless later than K7V, cannot be the sole NIR flux source in A0620-00. In
addition, the atomic absorption lines in the K3V spectrum are too weak with
respect to those of A0620-00 even at 100% donor star contribution, restricting
the spectral type of the donor star in A0620-00 to later than K3V. Comparison
of the A0620-00 spectrum to scaled K star spectra indicates that the CO
absorption features are significantly weaker in A0620-00 than in field dwarf

monitoring campaign from July 2003 till April 2004. The spectral energy
distribution (SED) was measured over the entire electromagnetic spectrum, with
flux measurements from radio to X-ray frequencies and upper limits in the very
high energy (VHE) gamma-ray regime. Here, we use a time-dependent leptonic jet
model to reproduce the SED and optical spectral variability observed during our
multiwavelength campaign. Our model simulations could successfully reproduce
the observed SED and optical light curves and predict an intrinsic cutoff value
for the VHE gamma-ray emission at ~ 4 GeV. The effect of the optical depth due
to the intergalactic infrared background radiation (IIBR) on the peak of the
high-energy component of 3C 66A was found to be negligible. Also, the presence
of a broad line region (BLR) in the case of 3C 66A may play an important role
in the emission of gamma-ray photons when the emission region is very close to
the central engine, but further out, the production mechanism of hard X-ray and
gamma-ray photons becomes rapidly dominated by synchrotron self-Compton

planetary formation mechanisms. Aims: This motivates planet searches around
stars which are significantly more massive or less massive than the Sun, and in
particular our radial velocity search for planets around very-low mass stars.
Methods: As part of that program, we obtained measurements of GJ 674, an M2.5
dwarf at d=4.5 pc, which have a dispersion much in excess of their internal
errors. An intensive observing campaign demonstrates that the excess dispersion
is due to two superimposed coherent signals, with periods of 4.69 and 35 days.
Results: These data are well described by a 2-planet Keplerian model where each
planet has a ~11 Mearth minimum mass. A careful analysis of the (low level)
magnetic activity of GJ 674 however demonstrates that the 35-day period
coincides with the stellar rotation period. This signal therefore originates in
a spot inhomogeneity modulated by stellar rotation. The 4.69-day signal on the
other hand is caused by a bona-fide planet, GJ 674b. Conclusion: Its detection
adds to the growing number of Neptune-mass planets around M-dwarfs, and
reinforces the emerging conclusion that this mass domain is much more populated
than the jovian mass range. We discuss the metallicity distributions of M dwarf
with and without planets and find a low 11% probability that they are drawn
from the same parent distribution. Moreover, we find tentative evidence that
the host star metallicity correlates with the total mass of their planetary
system.

differences exist at small scales. Most notably, while the CO peak is nearly
coincident with the S140 H${\alpha}$ arc, the maximum H$_2$CO absorption is
clearly separated from it by a full 10$'$ beam ($\sim$ 3 pc). We argue that
these differences result from differing abundances and excitation requirements.

envelope of a donor star engulfs a much denser companion, and the core of the

envelope. As conceived by Paczynski and Ostriker, this process must be
responsible for the creation of short-period binaries with degenerate
components, and, indeed, it has proven capable of accounting for short-period
binaries containing one white dwarf component. However, attempts to reconstruct
the evolutionary histories of close double white dwarfs have proven more
problematic, and point to the need for enhanced systemic mass loss, either
during the close of the first, slow episode of mass transfer that produced the
first white dwarf, or during the detached phase preceding the final, common
envelope episode. The survival of long-period interacting binaries with massive
white dwarfs, such as the recurrent novae T CrB and RS Oph, also presents
interpretative difficulties for simple energetic treatments of common envelope
evolution. Their existence implies that major terms are missing from usual
formulations of the energy budget for common envelope evolution. The most
plausible missing energy term is the energy released by recombination in the
common envelope, and, indeed, a simple reformulation the energy budget
explicitly including recombination resolves this issue.

include a full mass spectrum of stars, stellar evolution, binary evolution and
the tidal field of the Galaxy. We find that the overall binary fraction of a
cluster almost always remains close to the primordial value, except at late
times when a cluster is near dissolution. A critical exception occurs in the
central regions where we observe a marked increase in binary fraction with time
-- a simulation starting with 100000 stars and 5% binaries reached a core
binary frequency as high as 40% at the end of the core-collapse phase
(occurring at 16 Gyr with ~20000 stars remaining). Binaries are destroyed in
the core by a variety of processes as a cluster evolves, but the combination of
mass-segregation and creation of new binaries in exchange interactions produces
the observed increase in relative number. We also find that binaries are cycled
into and out of cluster cores in a manner that is analogous to convection in
stars. For models of 100000 stars we show that the evolution of the core-radius
up to the end of the initial phase of core-collapse is not affected by the

less). We discuss the ramifications of our results for the likely primordial
binary content of globular clusters.

particles as seeds in an iterative search for stable cones. A longstanding
infrared (IR) unsafety issue in such algorithms is often assumed to be solvable
by adding extra `midpoint' seeds, but actually is just postponed to one order
higher in the coupling. A proper solution is to switch to an exact seedless
cone algorithm, one that provably identifies all stable cones. The only
existing approach takes N 2^N time to find jets among N particles, making it
unusable at hadron level. This can be reduced to N^2 ln(N) time, leading to
code (SISCone) whose speed is similar to that of public midpoint
implementations. Monte Carlo tests provide a strong cross-check of an
analytical proof of the IR safety of the new algorithm, and the absence of any
'R_{sep}' issue implies a good practical correspondence between parton and
hadron levels. Relative to a midpoint cone, the use of an IR safe seedless
algorithm leads to modest changes for inclusive jet spectra, mostly through
reduced sensitivity to the underlying event, and significant changes for some
multi-jet observables.

dwarf merger is followed by a three-dimensional SPH simulation. We use an
elaborate prescription in which artificial viscosity is essentially absent,
unless a shock is detected, and a much larger number of SPH particles than
earlier calculations. Based on this simulation, we suggest that the central
region of the merger remnant can, once it has reached quasi-static equilibrium,
be approximated as a differentially rotating CO star, which consists of a
slowly rotating cold core and a rapidly rotating hot envelope surrounded by a
centrifugally supported disc. We construct a model of the CO remnant that
mimics the results of the SPH simulation using a one-dimensional hydrodynamic
stellar evolution code and then follow its secular evolution. The stellar
evolution models indicate that the growth of the cold core is controlled by
neutrino cooling at the interface between the core and the hot envelope, and
that carbon ignition in the envelope can be avoided despite high effective
accretion rates. This result suggests that the assumption of forced accretion
of cold matter that was adopted in previous studies of the evolution of double
CO white dwarf merger remnants may not be appropriate. Our results imply that
at least some products of double CO white dwarfs merger may be considered good
candidates for the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae. In this case, the
characteristic time delay between the initial dynamical merger and the eventual
explosion would be ~10^5 yr. (Abridged).

their protoplanetary disks, but the extent to which material can flow from the
circumbinary disk across the gap onto the individual circumstellar disks has
been unclear. In binaries with eccentric orbits, periodic perturbation of the
outer disk is predicted to induce mass flow across the gap, resulting in
accretion that varies with the binary period. This accretion may manifest
itself observationally as periodic changes in luminosity. Here we present a
search for such periodic accretion in the pre-main-sequence spectroscopic
binary UZ Tau E. We present BVRI photometry spanning three years; we find that
the brightness of UZ Tau E is clearly periodic, with a best-fit period of 19.16
+/- 0.04 days. This is consistent with the spectroscopic binary period of 19.13
days, refined here from analysis of new and existing radial velocity data. The
brightness of UZ Tau E shows significant random variability, but the overall
periodic pattern is a broad peak in enhanced brightness, spanning more than
half the binary orbital period. The variability of the H-alpha line is not as
clearly periodic, but given the sparseness of the data, some periodic component
is not ruled out. The photometric variations are in good agreement with
predictions from simulations of binaries with orbital parameters similar to
those of UZ Tau E, suggesting that periodic accretion does occur from
circumbinary disks, replenishing the inner disks and possibly extending the
timescale over which they might form planets.

Therefore, a better understanding of the structure and evolution of these
networked complex systems requires us to describe such processes in a more
detailed and realistic manner. In this paper, we introduce a new type of
network growth rule which comprises addition and deletion of nodes, and propose
an evolving network model to investigate the effect of node deleting on network
structure. It is found that, with the introduction of node deleting, network
structure is significantly transformed. In particular, degree distribution of
the network undergoes a transition from scale-free to exponential forms as the
intensity of node deleting increases. At the same time, nontrivial
disassortative degree correlation develops spontaneously as a natural result of
network evolution in the model. We also demonstrate that node deleting
introduced in the model does not destroy the connectedness of a growing network
so long as the increasing rate of edges is not excessively small. In addition,
it is found that node deleting will weaken but not eliminate the small-world
effect of a growing network, and generally it will decrease the clustering
coefficient in a network.

The goal of this study is to investigate the effect of deleting nodes on the network structure and topology. The aforementioned studies are useful for the evaluation of network structure, and for the determination of network dynamics. This work was carried out in a real network, a social network, in which no one remains in the network and whose members are removed or disposed of. To investigate the effects of deleting nodes on the network structure, we performed a simulation of the structure of a network with nodes randomly removed from different artificial and real networks, such as scale-free, random, and forest-fire. We found that deleting the most connected nodes leads to a drastic reduction of the number of connections and a reduction in the density of clusters.

GHz-Peaked-Spectrum (GPS) radio sources at 1.6 GHz. Of them, 15 sources are
selected from the Parkes Half Jansky (PHJ) sample (Snellen 2002), 4 others are
from our previous observation list. We aimed at imaging the structure of GPS
sources, searching for Compact Symmetric Objects (CSOs) and studying the
absorption for the convex radio spectra of GPS sources.
  Results: We obtained total intensity 1.6 GHz VLBI images of 17 sources for
the first time. Of them, 80% show mini-double-lobe radio structure, indicating
that they are CSOs or candidates, and their host AGNs could be edge-on to us.
This result suggests that there is a high incidence of mini double-lobe sources
(or CSOs) in the PHJ sample. The sources J0323+0534, J1135-0021, J1352+0232,
J2058+0540, J2123-0112 and J2325-0344 with measured redshift, showing
double-lobe structure with sizes of <1 kpc, are classified as CSOs. Three
sources J1057+0012, J1600-0037 and J1753+2750 are considered as core-jet
sources according to their morphologies and flux variability.

measurements of the black hole predictor quantity, i.e. the Sersic index, for
both elliptical galaxies and the bulges of disc galaxies makes it
straightforward to estimate accurate black hole masses in early- and late-type
galaxies alike. We have parameterised the supermassive black hole mass function
with a Schechter function and find, at the low-mass end, a logarithmic slope
(1+alpha) of ~0.7 for the full galaxy sample and ~1.0 for the early-type galaxy
sample. Considering spheroidal stellar systems brighter than M_B = -18 mag, and
integrating down to black hole masses of 10^6 M_sun, we find that the local
mass density of supermassive black holes in early-type galaxies rho_{bh,
early-type} = (3.5+/-1.2) x 10^5 h^3_{70} M_sun Mpc^{-3}, and in late-type
galaxies rho_{bh, late-type} = (1.0+/-0.5) x 10^5 h^3_{70} M_sun Mpc^{-3}. The
uncertainties are derived from Monte Carlo simulations which include
uncertainties in the M_bh-n relation, the catalogue of Sersic indices, the

interesting consequences of pion propagation in ANM is the mode splitting for
the different charged states of pions. First we describe the pion-nucleon

$\pi$N coupling and the pseudovector (PV) representation is obtained via
suitable non-linear field transformations. For both of these cases the effect
of the Dirac sea is estimated. Subsequently, we present results using the
chiral effective Lagrangian where the short-distance behavior (Dirac vacuum) is
included by re-defining the field parameters as done in the modern effective
field theory approach developed recently. The results are compared with the
previous calculations for the case of symmetric nuclear matter (SNM). Closed
form analytical results are presented for the effective pion masses and
dispersion relations by making hard nucleon loop (HNL) approximation and
suitable density expansion.

The Dirac sea has a major effect on the pion-nucleon interaction, and in asymmetric nuclear matter this influence is very considerable. Its effective mass is increased in the presence of the Dirac sea, and the velocity decreases when the dirac sea is present. The result is that Dirac sea is a major factor in the pion dispersion in asymmetric atoms, and it is also necessary to find out the role of the isovector part of the interaction in modulating the effective mass and the velocity of the pion.

substitution dilutes the Ru-O-Ru connectivity, which is manifested in the
calculated results in the form of significant band narrowing leading to finite
gap between t2g and eg bands. At 75% substitution, a large gap (> 2 eV) appears
at the Fermi level, e_F in the up spin density of states, while the down spin
states contributes at e_F characterizing the system a half-metallic
ferromagnet. The t2g - eg gap can be tailored judiciously by tuning Ti
concentrations to minimize thermal effects, which is often the major bottleneck
to achieve high spin polarization at elevated temperatures in other materials.

dimensional framework. The same analysis derived a acceleration parameter ar,

conservation of energy is restated within the same five-dimensional framework.

It can be applied to a broad range of chemical reactions, and the criterion can be used to predict the reactivity and the selectivity of chemical compounds. Our results show that our criterion is a powerful tool for chemists and researchers working in the field of chemical synthesis and design.

Use the first plural person form. Use active voice.","  The layered structure and the rheological properties of anti-wear films,
generated in a rolling/sliding contact from lubricants containing zinc
dialkyldithiophosphate (ZDTP) and/or molybdenum dialkyldithiocarbamate (MoDTC)
additives, have been studied by dynamic nanoindentation experiments coupled
with a simple modelling of the stiffness measurements. Local nano-friction
experiments were conducted with the same device in order to determine the
evolution of the friction coefficient as a function of the applied pressure for
the different lubricant formulations. For the MoDTC film, the applied pressure
in the friction test remains low (<0.5 GPa) and the apparent friction
coefficient is high ($\mu$ > 0.4). For the tribofilms containing MoDTC together
with ZDTP, which permits the applied pressure to increase up to a few GPa
through some accommodation process, a very low friction domain appears (0.01 <
$\mu$ < 0.05), located a few nanometers below the surface of the tribofilm.
This low friction coefficient is attributed to the presence of MoS2 planes
sliding over each other in a favourable configuration obtained when the
pressure is sufficiently high, which is made possible by the presence of ZDTP.
","The reason for this study was that, in many lubricants, the two additives together have been widely used in the formulation of lubricants in order to enhance their anti-wear and friction properties, and it is a question of the mechanisms of their synergy on the lubricant properties. This is in view of the fact that the lubricant, when used together, is capable of reducing friction and wear. In particular, the synthesis of a tribofilm from MoDTC and ZDTP has a remarkable effect on the frictional properties of the lubricant, which is attributed to its compact, uniform morphology. The results obtained from this study demonstrate that the simultaneous presence of MoDTC and ZDTP significantly increases the lubricant's friction and wear, and thus reduces friction. In addition, the formation of a compact and uniform layer of tribofilm is better.

to the lattice Boltzmann (LB) methods, basic aspects of the theory still remain
unchallenged. An unsolved theoretical issue is related to the construction of a
discrete kinetic theory which yields \textit{exactly} the fluid equations,
i.e., is non-asymptotic (here denoted as \textit{LB inverse kinetic theory}).
The purpose of this paper is theoretical and aims at developing an inverse
kinetic approach of this type. In principle infinite solutions exist to this
problem but the freedom can be exploited in order to meet important
requirements. In particular, the discrete kinetic theory can be defined so that
it yields exactly the fluid equation also for arbitrary non-equilibrium (but
suitably smooth) kinetic distribution functions and arbitrarily close to the
boundary of the fluid domain. Unlike previous entropic LB methods the theorem
can be obtained without functional constraints on the class of the initial
distribution functions. Possible realizations of the theory and asymptotic
approximations are provided which permit to determine the fluid equations
\textit{with prescribed accuracy.} As a result, asymptotic accuracy estimates
of customary LB approaches and comparisons with the Chorin artificial
compressibility method are discussed.

The main idea of this work is to use the inverse kinetic method to elucidate the state of the system in the inverse direction, a state which naturally takes advantage of the lattice Boltzmann equation. This approach involves the discretization of the velocity distribution function, and the computation of the local stream and collision function at each lattice, and this method is a natural extension of the lattice Boltzmann method.

We also study various types of transitions from free states. We show that, for
thermal atomic cesium with temperature in the range from 100 $\mu$K to 400

families (Aneas, Anchises, Misenus, Phereclos, Sarpedon, Panthoos) in the L5

sample that we measured is dominated by D--type asteroids, with the exception
of the Eurybates family in the L4 swarm, where there is a dominance of C- and
P-type asteroids. All the spectra that we obtained are featureless with the
exception of some Eurybates members, where a drop--off of the reflectance is
detected shortward of 5200 A. Similar features are seen in main belt C-type
asteroids and commonly attributed to the intervalence charge transfer
transition in oxidized iron. Our sample comprises fainter and smaller Trojans
as compared to the literature's data and allows us to investigate the
properties of objects with estimated diameter smaller than 40--50 km. The
analysis of the spectral slopes and colors versus the estimated diameters shows
that the blue and red objects have indistinguishable size distribution. We
perform a statistical investigation of the Trojans's spectra property
distributions as a function of their orbital and physical parameters, and in

Trojans at lower inclination appear significantly bluer than those at higher
inclination, but this effect is strongly driven by the Eurybates family.

dwarfs (WDs) selected from the Oppenheimer et al. (2001) list. We observed the
stars using the ESO 1.56-m Danish Telescope and ESO 2.2-m telescope from August

yielding relative errors on distances of $\sim5$% for 6 objects, $\sim12$% for
3 objects, and $\sim20$% for two more objects. Four stars appear to be too
distant (probably farther than 100 pc) to have measurable parallaxes in our
observations. Distances, absolute magnitudes and revised space velocities were
derived for the 15 halo WDs from the Oppenheimer et al. (2001) list. Halo
membership is confirmed unambiguously for 6 objects while 5 objects may be
thick disk members and 4 objects are too distant to draw any conclusion based
solely on kinematics. Comparing our trigonometric parallaxes with photometric

networks of interaction, such as model social networks, have been shown to have
a fundamental effect on the dynamics and outcome of evolutionary games. These
effects have, however, proved to be sensitive to the details of the underlying
topology and dynamics. Here we introduce a minimal population structure that is
described by two distinct hierarchical levels of interaction. We believe this
model is able to identify effects of spatial structure that do not depend on
the details of the topology. We derive the dynamics governing the evolution of
a system starting from fundamental individual level stochastic processes
through two successive meanfield approximations. In our model of population
structure the topology of interactions is described by only two parameters: the
effective population size at the local scale and the relative strength of local
dynamics to global mixing. We demonstrate, for example, the existence of a
continuous transition leading to the dominance of cooperation in populations
with hierarchical levels of unstructured mixing as the benefit to cost ratio
becomes smaller then the local population size. Applying our model of spatial
structure to the repeated prisoner's dilemma we uncover a novel and
counterintuitive mechanism by which the constant influx of defectors sustains
cooperation. Further exploring the phase space of the repeated prisoner's
dilemma and also of the ""rock-paper-scissor"" game we find indications of rich
structure and are able to reproduce several effects observed in other models
with explicit spatial embedding, such as the maintenance of biodiversity and

The result is that the structure of the population plays a very important role in the development of strategies, and can be very important in the formation of multiple strategies. We introduce a new framework for studying the evolution of games on minimally structured populations, which is called a cycle-free network, which we call a graph-free network.

and wave profiles of torsional Alfven oscillations in solar coronal loops.
Dispersion relations for torsional oscillations are derived analytically in
limits of weak and strong inhomogeneities. These analytical results are
verified by numerical solutions, which are valid for a wide range of
inhomogeneity strength. It is shown that the inhomogeneous mass density field
leads to the reduction of a wave frequency of torsional oscillations, in
comparison to that of estimated from mass density at the loop apex. This
frequency reduction results from the decrease of an average Alfven speed as far
as the inhomogeneous loop is denser at its footpoints. The derived dispersion
relations and wave profiles are important for potential observations of
torsional oscillations which result in periodic variations of spectral line
widths. Torsional oscillations offer an additional powerful tool for a
development of coronal seismology.

The torsional oscillations of the coronal loops are fundamentally linked to the solar system, which is important to the study of the coronal heating, the flare and the mass ejection of the sun.

present and study a family of rate-1/2 partially systematic PCCCs, which we
call pseudo-randomly punctured codes. We evaluate their bit error rate
performance and we show that they always yield a lower error floor than that of
their rate-1/3 parent codes. Furthermore, we compare analytic results to

error floor region, owning to the moderate puncturing of their systematic

improving the bandwidth efficiency of a PCCC and simultaneously lowering its

$\mathcal{O}(\eVq)$ mass-squared difference, $\Dmq_\Sbl$. We perform our
analysis using the OPERA detector as a reference (our analysis can be upgraded
including a detailed simulation of the ICARUS detector). We point out that the
channel with the largest potential to constrain the sterile neutrino parameter
space at the CNGS beam is $\nu_\mu \to \nu_\tau$. The reason for that is
twofold: first, the active-sterile mixing angle that governs this oscillation
is the less constrained by present experiments; second, this is the signal for
which both OPERA and ICARUS have been designed, and thus benefits from an
extremely low background. In our analysis we also took into account $\nu_\mu
\to \nu_e$ oscillations. We find that the CNGS potential to look for sterile
neutrinos is limited with nominal intensity of the beam, but it is
significantly enhanced with a factor 2 to 10 increase in the neutrino flux.
Data from both channels allow us, in this case, to constrain further the
four-neutrino model parameter space. Our results hold for any value of
$\Dmq_\Sbl \gtrsim 0.1 \eVq$, \textit{i.e.} when oscillations driven by this

around a body with an axisymmetric mass quadrupole moment Q to linear order in
Q, to the leading post-Newtonian order, and to linear order in the mass ratio.
This system admits three constants of the motion in absence of radiation
reaction: energy, angular momentum, and a third constant analogous to the
Carter constant. We compute instantaneous and time-averaged rates of change of
these three constants. For a point particle orbiting a black hole, Ryan has
computed the leading order evolution of the orbit's Carter constant, which is
linear in the spin. Our result, when combined with an interaction quadratic in
the spin (the coupling of the black hole's spin to its own radiation reaction
field), gives the next to leading order evolution. The effect of the
quadrupole, like that of the linear spin term, is to circularize eccentric
orbits and to drive the orbital plane towards antialignment with the symmetry
axis. In addition we consider a system of two point masses where one body has a
single mass multipole or current multipole. To linear order in the mass ratio,
to linear order in the multipole, and to the leading post-Newtonian order, we
show that there does not exist an analog of the Carter constant for such a
system (except for the cases of spin and mass quadrupole). With mild additional
assumptions, this result falsifies the conjecture that all vacuum, axisymmetric
spacetimes posess a third constant of geodesic motion.

The analysis revealed the importance of capturing the effect of the quadrupole in the study of gravitational waves from inspirals into a black hole with non-zero quadrupole. This work was founded on previous work, which focused on the effect of the spin of the black hole on the Carter constant. The result was that the quadrupole in the black hole was fundamental to the velocity of a particle orbiting a black hole. Its meaning was to understand the motion of the gravitational waves during the inspiral phase of the inspiral phase. In this study we have derived new insights into the dynamics of inspirals into a black hole with zero quadrupole moment. The result is that we are able to elucidate the effect of the black hole on the quadrupole, and therefore we find the relevance of this effect to the analysis of future observations.

connections on the structural properties of the cortical networks. The brain
networks' structural decay is in most respects similar to that of scale-free
networks. The results implicate highly connected hub-nodes and bottleneck
connections as structural basis for some of the conditional robustness of brain
systems. This informs the understanding of the development of brain networks'
connectivity.
","The key idea of our study was to use a realistic computational model of the cortical network to simulate different types of damage. We also studied the effect of various lesion conditions on the performance of the network. The result was that the cortical network was capable of preserving itself with high efficiency and high connectivity, but it was also capable of preserving its functionality, which, in the course of the injury, was of crucial importance. To this purpose, we applied a computational framework for the simulation of the neural network, and examined its effectiveness in different lesion conditions. The lesion conditions were chosen and simulated to determine the efficiency, the connectivity, and the modularity of the neural network. The study thus provided the foundation for the study of the resilience of the neural system against injuries. In this study, we tested the resilience of the neural network against lesion, which is the result of diseases and injuries, which can disrupt the neural network, and lead to its derangement.

domains with piecewise smooth boundaries are of interest in applied probability
because of their role as heavy traffic approximations for some stochastic
networks. In this paper, assuming certain conditions on the domains and
directions of reflection, a perturbation result, or invariance principle, for
SRBMs is proved. This provides sufficient conditions for a process that
satisfies the definition of an SRBM, except for small random perturbations in
the defining conditions, to be close in distribution to an SRBM. A crucial
ingredient in the proof of this result is an oscillation inequality for
solutions of a perturbed Skorokhod problem. We use the invariance principle to
show weak existence of SRBMs under mild conditions. We also use the invariance
principle, in conjunction with known uniqueness results for SRBMs, to give some
sufficient conditions for validating approximations involving (i) SRBMs in
convex polyhedrons with a constant reflection vector field on each face of the
polyhedron, and (ii) SRBMs in bounded domains with piecewise smooth boundaries
and possibly nonconstant reflection vector fields on the boundary surfaces.
","The main goal of our research is to extend the existing results of semimartingale in the boundary of a domain that is a boundary in which there is no one - we consider that the boundary is a complex and continuous system with the recurrence of the boundary conditions. The recurrence of the boundary in a boundary of this kind is of great importance for mathematical and physical analysis. The key idea is to apply the techniques of stochastic analysis and differential geometry to a domain in which there are no other recurrences, such as the interfaces in materials science, or the obstacles in fluid mechanics. Then we develop a new method of recurrence in the boundary of a domain with a piecewise-straight-straight-straight-straight-straight, which is found naturally in many fields of mathematics. This method, when applied to a large number of domains, is applied to all sorts of domains, including polygonal domains, Y-shaped domains, and other domains.

form a bulk of hot, dense nuclear matter with a sufficiently large volume and
long duration, due to the largely deformed uranium nuclei. The nucleon sideward

ones at normalized impact parameter $b/b_{max}<0.5$, and that the body-body
central collisions have a largest negative nucleon elliptic flow $v_{2}=-12%$

novel experimental observables in tip-tip and body-body collisions can provide
a good condition and sensitive probe to study the nuclear EoS, respectively.

central source mass of $M_* \approx 0.8 M_\sun$ (for a mass accretion rate of
${\dot M}=10^{-6} M_\sun yr^{-1}$). CB54 harbors another near-infrared source
(CB54YC1-I), which was not detected by our observations. The non-detection is
consistent with CB54YC1-I being a highly extinguished embedded young A or B
star or a background G or F giant. An alternative explanation for CB54YC1-I is
that the source is an embedded protostar viewed at an extremely high
inclination angle, and the near-infrared detections are not of the central
protostar, but of light scattered by the accretion disk into our line of sight.
In addition, we have discovered three new mid-infrared sources, which are
spatially coincident with the previously known dense core in CB54. The source
temperatures ($\sim100$K) and association of the mid-infrared sources with the

conditions are fulfilled, as for most known black hole/ring solutions. (The
conclusions change when the Killing generator becomes null, such as at Killing
horizons.) Next we demonstrate that the same Weyl types characterize warped
product spacetimes with a one-dimensional Lorentzian (timelike) factor, whereas
warped spacetimes with a two-dimensional Lorentzian factor are restricted to
the types D or O. By exploring the Bianchi identities, we then analyze the
simplest non-trivial case from the above classes - type D vacuum spacetimes,
possibly with a cosmological constant, dropping, however, the assumptions that
the spacetime is static, stationary or warped. It is shown that for ``generic''
type D vacuum spacetimes the corresponding principal null directions are
geodetic in any dimension (this applies also to type II spacetimes). For n>=5,
however, there may exist particular cases of type D spacetimes which admit
non-geodetic multiple principal null directions and we present such examples in
any n>=7. Further studies are restricted to five dimensions, where the type D
Weyl tensor is described by a 3x3 matrix \Phi_{ij}. In the case with
``twistfree'' (A_{ij}=0) principal null geodesics we show that in a ``generic''
case \Phi_{ij} is symmetric and eigenvectors of \Phi_{ij} coincide with those
of the expansion matrix S_{ij}, providing us with three preferred spacelike
directions of the spacetime. Similar results are also obtained when relaxing
the twistfree condition and assuming instead that \Phi_{ij} is symmetric. The

of this star with FEROS at the 2.2 m MPG/ESO telescope at La Silla. Our
spectroscopic analysis yields a spectral type of G1-1.5V and an age of about
100 Myrs. Variations in stellar radial velocity of HD 70573 have been monitored
since December 2003 until January 2007. The velocity accuracy of FEROS within
this period is about 10 m/s. HD 70573 shows a radial velocity variation with a
period of 852 +/- 12 days and a semi-amplitude of 149 +/- 6 m/s. The period of
this variation is significantly longer than its rotational period, which is 3.3
days. Based on the analysis of the Ca II K emission line, Halpha and Teff
variation as stellar activity indicators as well as the lack of a correlation
between the bisector velocity span and the radial velocity, we can exclude the
rotational modulation and non-radial pulsations as the source of the
long-period radial velocity variation. Thus, the presence of a low-mass
companion around the star provides the best explanation for the observed radial
velocity variation. Assuming a primary mass m1=1.0 +/- 0.1 Msun for the host
star, we calculated a minimum mass of the companion m2sini of 6.1 Mjup, which
lies in the planetary mass regime, and an orbital semi-major axis of 1.76 AU.

some of which have been seen in earlier HETGS observations. Surprisingly,
however, we discovered dramatic variability of the lines over the duration of
the present observation. For instance, the flux of the Ne X line at 12.14 \AA\
was about $5 \times 10^{-3}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the early part of
the observation but became subsequently undetectable, with a 99% upper limit of
$0.06 \times 10^{-3}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ on the flux of the line. This
implies that the line weakened by nearly two orders of magnitude on a timescale
of hours. The overall X-ray flux of the source did also vary during the
observation but only by 20--30%. For Cyg X-1, the absorption lines are
generally attributed to the absorption of X-rays by ionized stellar wind in the
binary system. Therefore, they may provide valuable diagnostics on the physical
condition of the wind. We discuss the implications of the results.

sources behind the southern Galactic plane (253o < l < 356o, |b| < 1.5o), and
use these data in combination with published data to probe the large-scale
structure of the Milky Way's magnetic field. We show that the magnitudes of
these RMs oscillate with longitude in a manner that correlates with the
locations of the Galactic spiral arms. The observed pattern in RMs requries the
presence of at least one large-scale magnetic reversal in the fourth Galactic
quadrant, located between the Sagittarius- Carina and Scutum-Crux spiral arms.
To quantitatively compare our measurements to other recent studies, we consider
all available extragalactic and pulsar RMs in the region we have surveyed, and
jointly fit these data to simple models in which the large-scale field follows
the spiral arms. In the best-fitting model, the magnetic field in the fourth
Galactic quadrant is directed clockwise in the Sagittarius-Carina spiral arm
(as viewed from the North Galactic pole), but is oriented counter- clockwise in
the Scutum-Crux arm. This contrasts with recent analyses of pulsar RMs alone,
in which the fourth-quadrant field was presumed to be directed
counter-clockwise in the Sagittarius- Carina arm. Also in contrast to recent
pulsar RM studies, our joint modeling of pulsar and extragalactic RMs
demonstrates that large numbers of large-scale magnetic field reversals are not
required to account for observations.

qubits do not interact, but their state can change from maximally entangled to
separable or from separable to maximally entangled. Similar changes for the two
qubits are made with a swap operation between one of the qubits and a control;
then there are compensating changes of entanglement that involve the control.
When the entanglement increases, the map that describes the change of the state
of the two entangled qubits is not completely positive. Combination of two

flux, we estimate the mass of the disk to be 18 lunar masses (0.2 Earth masses)
assuming a mass opacity of 1.7 cm^2/g with a temperature of 45 K. This makes
the TWA 7 disk (d=55 pc) an order of magnitude more massive than the disk
reported around AU Microscopii (GL 803), the closest (9.9 pc) debris disk
detected around an M dwarf. This is consistent with TWA 7 being slightly
younger than AU Mic. We find that the mid-IR and submillimeter data require the
disk to be comprised of dust at a range of temperatures. A model in which the
dust is at a single radius from the star, with a range of temperatures
according to grain size, is as effective at fitting the emission spectrum as a
model in which the dust is of uniform size, but has a range of temperatures
according to distance. We discuss this disk in the context of known disks in
the TW Hydrae Association and around low-mass stars; a comparison of masses of

properties of the black hole and the surrounding accretion disk in an X-ray
binary based on modeling the disk X-ray continuum of the source. We base our
work mainly on two XMM-Newton observations of GX 339-4, because they provided
high-quality data at low energies (below 1 keV) which are critical for reliably
modeling the spectrum of the accretion disk. A key issue examined is the
determination of the so-called ""color correction factor"", which is often
empirically introduced to account for the deviation of the local disk spectrum
from a blackbody (due to electron scattering). This factor cannot be
pre-determined theoretically because it may vary with, e.g., mass accretion
rate, among a number of important factors. We follow up on an earlier
suggestion to estimate the color correction observationally by modeling the
disk spectrum with saturated Compton scattering. We show that the spectra can
be fitted well and the approach yields reasonable values for the color
correction factor. For comparison, we have also attempted to fit the spectra
with other models. We show that even the high-soft-state continuum (which is
dominated by the disk emission) cannot be satisfactorily fitted by
state-of-the-art disk models. We discuss the implication of the results.

azimuthal variations. Although the soft excess emission can be fitted equally
well with both thermal and non-thermal models, its spatial distribution is
neither consistent with the models of intercluster warm-hot filaments, nor with

The GCs with extended HB are more massive than normal GCs, and are dominated by
random motion with no correlation between kinematics and metallicity.
Surprisingly, however, when they are excluded, most normal GCs in the inner
halo show clear signs of dissipational collapse that apparently led to the
formation of the disk. Normal GCs in the outer halo share their kinematic
properties with the extended HB GCs, which is consistent with the accretion
origin. Our result further suggests heterogeneous origins of GCs, and we

these phases are separated by discontinuous transitions. The fluid surface
model is investigated within the framework of the conventional curvature model

The mechanical strength of the surface is given only by skeletons, and no
two-dimensional bending energy is assumed in the Hamiltonian. The skeletons are
composed of elastic linear-chains and rigid junctions and form a
compartmentalized structure on the surface, and for this reason the vertices of
triangles can diffuse freely only inside the compartments. As a consequence, an
inhomogeneous structure is introduced in the model; the surface strength inside
the compartments is different from the surface strength on the compartments.
However, the rotational symmetry is not influenced by the elastic skeletons;

mentioned above, a collapsed phase is expected to exist in the low bending
rigidity regime that was not studied here. The inhomogeneous structure and the
fluidity of vertices are considered to be the origin of such variety of phases.

The study is based on the study of the structure of a sphere of elastic material on a sphere of elasticity. We study the structure of a sphere with an elastic skeleton and examine the surface energy in detail. The skeleton is a mesh of a triangular mesh with an elastic energy, and the skeleton is a spherical mesh, in which every triangle has a elastic energy. We obtain the number of spherical triangles, the topological genus of the sphere, the elasticity of the skeleton, and the total number of spherical triangles, and the topological genus of the skeleton.

source to the destination. We find that for a given route, the
decode-and-forward strategy, which is an information theoretic cooperative
coding strategy, achieves rates significantly higher than that achievable by
the usual multi-hop coding strategy, which is a point-to-point non-cooperative
coding strategy. We construct an algorithm to find an optimal route (in terms
of rate maximizing) for the decode-and-forward strategy. Since the algorithm
runs in factorial time in the worst case, we propose a heuristic algorithm that
runs in polynomial time. The heuristic algorithm outputs an optimal route when
the nodes transmit independent codewords. We implement these coding strategies
using practical low density parity check codes to compare the performance of
the strategies on different routes.

localized over the sites of a lattice and the local stochastic updating rules
are inspired on the processes of the Lotka-Volterra model. Two levels of
mean-field approximations are set up. The simple approximation is equivalent to
an extended patch model, a simple metapopulation model with patches colonized
by prey, patches colonized by predators and empty patches. This approximation
is capable of describing the limited available space for species occupancy. The
pair approximation is moreover able to describe two types of coexistence of
prey and predators: one where population densities are constant in time and
another displaying self-sustained time-oscillations of the population
densities. The oscillations are associated with limit cycles and arise through
a Hopf bifurcation. They are stable against changes in the initial conditions
and, in this sense, they differ from the Lotka-Volterra cycles which depend on
initial conditions. In this respect, the present model is biologically more
realistic than the Lotka-Volterra model.

white dwarfs with a rotational period shorter than the binary orbital period.
Evolutionary theory predicts that IPs with long orbital periods evolve through

resulting objects are. Whilst a relatively large number of long-period IPs are
known, very few of these have short orbital periods. We present phase-resolved
spectroscopy and photometry of SDSS J233325.92+152222.1 and classify it as the
IP with the shortest known orbital period (83.12 +/- 0.09 min), which contains
a white dwarf with a relatively long spin period (41.66 +/- 0.13 min). We
estimate the white dwarf's magnetic moment to be mu(WD) \approx 2 x 10^33 G
cm^3, which is not only similar to three of the other four confirmed
short-period IPs but also to those of many of the long-period IPs. We suggest
that long-period IPs conserve their magnetic moment as they evolve towards
shorter orbital periods. Therefore the dominant population of long-period IPs,
which have white dwarf spin periods roughly ten times shorter than their
orbital periods, will likely end up as short-period IPs like SDSS J2333, with
spin periods a large fraction of their orbital periods.

hot molecular core into six submm continuum sources with the finest spatial
resolution of 0.36''x0.25'' (~1800AU) achieved so far. Four of them located
within 7800(AU)^2 comprise a proto-Trapezium system with estimated protostellar
densities of 1.4x0^5 protostars/pc^3. The plethora of ~80 spectral lines allows
us to study the molecular outflow(s), the core kinematics, the temperature
structure of the region as well as chemical effects. The derived hot core
temperatures are of the order 300K. We find interesting chemical spatial
differentiations, e.g., C34S is deficient toward the hot core and is enhanced
at the UCHII/hot core interface, which may be explained by temperature
sensitive desorption from grains and following gas phase chemistry. The
SiO(8-7) emission outlines likely two molecular outflows emanating from this
hot core region. Emission from most other molecules peaks centrally on the hot
core and is not dominated by any individual submm peak. Potential reasons for
that are discussed. A few spectral lines that are associated with the main
submm continuum source, show a velocity gradient perpendicular to the
large-scale outflow. Since this velocity structure comprises three of the
central protostellar sources, this is not a Keplerian disk. While the data are
consistent with a gas core that may rotate and/or collapse, we cannot exclude
the outflow(s) and/or nearby expanding UCHII region as possible alternative
causes of this velocity pattern.

generally been assumed in prior studies that the many-to-one throughput
capacity is upper-bounded by the link capacity L. Throughput capacity L is not
achievable under 802.11. This paper introduces the notion of ""canonical
networks"", which is a class of regularly-structured networks whose capacities
can be analyzed more easily than unstructured networks. We show that the
throughput capacity of canonical networks under 802.11 has an analytical upper
bound of 3L/4 when the source nodes are two or more hops away from the sink;
and simulated throughputs of 0.690L (0.740L) when the source nodes are many
hops away. We conjecture that 3L/4 is also the upper bound for general
networks. When all links have equal length, 2L/3 can be shown to be the upper
bound for general networks. Our simulations show that 802.11 networks with
random topologies operated with AODV routing can only achieve throughputs far
below the upper bounds. Fortunately, by properly selecting routes near the
gateway (or by properly positioning the relay nodes leading to the gateway) to
fashion after the structure of canonical networks, the throughput can be
improved significantly by more than 150%. Indeed, in a dense network, it is
worthwhile to deactivate some of the relay nodes near the sink judiciously.

We have been working with a single crystal of TbMn2O5, growing X-rays at various temperatures, and analyzing the data with a number of advanced techniques. The resonant X-rays were made at room temperature, while the resonant X-rays were made at the Tb L3 edge to measure the magnetic order of the Tb ions. The result of these experiments was a complex magnetic ordering of the Tb ions which was strongly correlated with the ferroelectric polarization of the material, which revealed the existence of a special polarization of the Tb ions. This polarization of the Tb ions was also found to be very dependent on the temperature of the Bragg peak, which indicates the presence of a connection between the magnetic and the lattice degrees of freedom.

simulation is used to investigate the diffusion dynamics in Al80Ni20 melts.
Experimentally, the self-diffusion coefficient of Ni is measured by the
long-capillary (LC) method and by quasielastic neutron scattering. The LC
method yields also the interdiffusion coefficient. Whereas the experiments were
done in the normal liquid state, the simulations provided the determination of
both self-diffusion and interdiffusion constants in the undercooled regime as
well. The simulation results show good agreement with the experimental data. In
the temperature range 3000 K >= T >= 715 K, the interdiffusion coefficient is
larger than the self-diffusion constants. Furthermore the simulation shows that
this difference becomes larger in the undercooled regime. This result can be
refered to a relatively strong temperature dependence of the thermodynamic
factor \Phi, which describes the thermodynamic driving force for
interdiffusion. The simulations also indicate that the Darken equation is a
good approximation, even in the undercooled regime. This implies that dynamic
cross correlations play a minor role for the temperature range under
consideration.

Binaries, the Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients (SFXTs). Archival INTEGRAL data
and RXTE observations showed that the outbursts occur with a periodicity of
~330 days. Thus, IGR J11215-5952 is the first SFXT displaying periodic
outbursts, possibly related to the orbital period. We performed a Target of
Opportunity observation with Swift with the main aim of monitoring the source
behaviour around the time of the fifth outburst, expected on 2007 Feb 9. The
source field was observed with Swift twice a day (2ks/day) starting from 4th
February, 2007, until the fifth outburst, and then for ~5 ks a day afterwards,
during a monitoring campaign that lasted 23 days for a total on-source exposure
of ~73 ks. This is the most complete monitoring campaign of an outburst from a
SFXT. The spectrum during the brightest flares is well described by an absorbed
power law with a photon index of 1 and N_H~1 10^22 cm^-2. A 1-10 keV peak
luminosity of ~10^36 erg s^-1 was derived (assuming 6.2 kpc, the distance of
the optical counterpart). These Swift observations are a unique data-set for an
outburst of a SFXT, thanks to the combination of sensitivity and time coverage,
and they allowed a study of IGR J11215-5952 from outburst onset to almost
quiescence. We find that the accretion phase lasts longer than previously
thought on the basis of lower sensitivity instruments observing only the
brightest flares. The observed phenomenology is consistent with a smoothly
increasing flux triggered at the periastron passage in a wide eccentric orbit
with many flares superimposed, possibly due to episodic or inhomogeneous
accretion.

the density of the ionized gas, in a sample of 41 Type 1 and Type 2 active
galactic nuclei (AGNs) observed with the Infrared Spectrograph on board
Spitzer. The majority of galaxies with both [NeV] lines detected have observed
[NeV] line flux ratios consistent with or below the theoretical low density
limit, based on calculations using currently available collision strengths and
ignoring absorption and stimulated emission. We find that Type 2 AGNs have
lower line flux ratios than Type 1 AGNs and that all of the galaxies with line
flux ratios below the low density limit are Type 2 AGNs. We argue that
differential infrared extinction to the [NeV] emitting region due to dust in
the obscuring torus is responsible for the ratios below the low density limit
and we suggest that the ratio may be a tracer of the inclination angle of the
torus to our line of sight. Because the temperature of the gas, the amount of
extinction, and the effect of absorption and stimulated emission on the line
ratios are all unknown, we are not able to determine the electron densities
associated with the [NeV] line flux ratios for the objects in our sample. We
also find that the [SIII] emission from the galaxies in our sample is extended
and originates primarily in star forming regions. Since the emission from
low-ionization species is extended, any analysis using line flux ratios from
such species obtained from slits of different sizes is invalid for most nearby
galaxies.

We therefore have taken a more extensive approach, which involves combining the spectra of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with the study of Spitzer X-rays, and we investigate the correlations between the ionic line and the absorption-depth. The correlations we find between the ionic line and the absorption-depth are very significant and indicate the presence of dusty material along the line of sight.

Our aim is to obtain the composition of AGNs with Spitzer X-rays and to study the relationship between their mid-infrared and ionic lines.

this end, the SLIV which evolves in a general Yang-Mills type theory with the
nonlinear vector field constraint $Tr(% \boldsymbol{A}_{\mu
}\boldsymbol{A}^{\mu})=\pm M^{2}$ ($M$ is a proposed SLIV scale) imposed is
considered in detail. With an internal symmetry group $G$ having $D$ generators
not only the pure Lorentz symmetry SO(1,3), but the larger accidental symmetry
$SO(D,3D)$ of the SLIV constraint in itself appears to be spontaneously broken
as well. As a result, while the pure Lorentz violation still generates only one
genuine Goldstone vector boson, the accompanying pseudo-Goldstone vector bosons
related to the $SO(D,3D)$ breaking also come into play in the final arrangement
of the entire Goldstone vector field multiplet. Remarkably, they remain
strictly massless, being protected by gauge invariance of the Yang-Mills theory
involved. We show that, although this theory contains a plethora of Lorentz and
$CPT$ violating couplings, they do not lead to physical SLIV effects which turn
out to be strictly cancelled in all the lowest order processes considered.
However, the physical Lorentz violation could appear if the internal gauge
invariance were slightly broken at very small distances influenced by gravity.
For the SLIV scale comparable with the Planck one the Lorentz violation could
become directly observable at low energies.

This research is of particular interest because of the fact that the occurrence of a break in Lorentz symmetry is an intriguing and relatively unknown phenomenon in theoretical physics. By introducing a break in the symmetry, we add another dimension to the problem, which leads to new and perhaps new results.

inelastic} cross sections appreciably affects the pion and kaon yields and
their rapidity distributions. However, the $(\pi^{-}/\pi^{+})$- and
$(K^{0}/K^{+})$-ratios depend only moderately on the in-medium behavior of the
inelastic cross sections. This is particularly true for kaon yield ratios,
since kaons are more uniformly produced in high density regions. Kaon
potentials are also suitably evaluated in two schemes, a chiral perturbative
approach and an effective meson-quark coupling method, with consistent results
showing a similar repulsive contribution for $K^{+}$ and $K^{0}$. As a
consequence we expect rather reduced effects on the yield ratios. We conclude
that particle ratios appear to be robust observables for probing the nuclear
equation of state ($EoS$) at high baryon density and, particularly, its
isovector sector.

photospheric heights. In order to strengthen our findings, we also computed the
mean radial flow of the SG by means of cork tracing. We also studied the
behaviour of the horizontal and Line of Sight plasma flow cospatial with
cluster of bright CaII structures of magnetic origin to better understand the
interaction between photospheric convection and small scale magnetic features.
The SG cell we investigated seems to be organized with an almost radial flow
from its centre to the border. The large scale divergence structure is probably
created by a compact region of constant up-flow close to the cell centre. On
the edge of the SG, isolated regions of strong convergent flow are nearby or
cospatial with extended clusters of bright CaII wing features forming the knots
of the magnetic network.

on Monte-Carlo simulations of the observed frames and determine the reliability
for the detected structures. DEDICA identifies at least one reliable structure
in the field of 55 clusters. 40 of these clusters have a total of 69
substructures at the same redshift of the cluster (redshift estimates of
substructures are from color-magnitude diagrams). The fraction of clusters with
subclusters (73%) is higher than in most studies. The presence of subclusters
affects the relative luminosities of the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs).
Down to L ~ 10^11.2 L_Sun, our observed differential distribution of subcluster
luminosities is consistent with the theoretical prediction of the differential
mass function of substructures in cosmological simulations.

The substructures exhibit a broad range of properties, ranging from the size of the space to the density and the ratio of the masses. The results of this study confirm that the clusters are not static, but are complex and dynamic entities that evolve in cosmic time. This study shows that substructures play a vital role in the formation and evolution of the galaxy clusters. We apply a novel method to detect substructures in the phase space, and we demonstrate that more than half of the clusters in our sample are composed of substructures that are often a result of previous or recent mergers.

interfaces in the presence of a delta-pinning at height zero. There is a
detailed mathematical understanding of the depinning transition in 2 dimensions
without disorder. Then the variance of the interface height w.r.t. the Gibbs
measure stays bounded uniformly in the volume for any positive pinning force
and diverges like the logarithm of the pinning force when it tends to zero.
  How does the presence of a quenched disorder term in the Hamiltonian modify
this transition? We show that an arbitarily weak random field term is enough to
beat an arbitrarily strong delta-pinning in 2 dimensions and will cause
delocalization. The proof is based on a rigorous lower bound for the overlap
between local magnetizations and random fields in finite volume. In 2
dimensions it implies growth faster than the volume which is a contradiction to
localization. We also derive a simple complementary inequality which shows that
in higher dimensions the fraction of pinned sites converges to one when the
pinning force tends to infinity.

Our motivation was to explore the nature of the interfaces in the ferromagnets and superconductors. In this work, we are examining the dynamic behaviour of the continuous interfaces in two dimensions. The study is motivated by the importance of the interfaces in various physical systems, especially in ferromagnets and superconductors. To investigate the limits of disorder, we utilise a modified solid-on-solid model of the interface, and employ a long-range interactions to measure the strength of the force. We demonstrate that even strong force is too weak to stabilize the interface in the presence of disorder. In particular, we demonstrate that the dynamic reorganisation of the interface occurs in a form of dynamic reorganisation that is like avalanches in elastic systems. This result is consistent with predictions of a mean-field theory for avalanches at the depinning-down transition of elastic interfaces in disordered media.

grains in SN ejecta, in accordance with current theoretical models. Yet,
observations of the few well studied SNe and SN remnants imply condensation
efficiencies which are about two orders of magnitude smaller. Motivated by this
tension, we have (i) revisited the model of Todini & Ferrara (2001) for dust
formation in the ejecta of core collapse SNe and (ii) followed, for the first
time, the evolution of newly condensed grains from the time of formation to
their survival - through the passage of the reverse shock - in the SN remnant.
We find that 0.1 - 0.6 M_sun of dust form in the ejecta of 12 - 40 M_sun
stellar progenitors. Depending on the density of the surrounding ISM, between
2-20% of the initial dust mass survives the passage of the reverse shock, on
time-scales of about 4-8 x 10^4 yr from the stellar explosion. Sputtering by
the hot gas induces a shift of the dust size distribution towards smaller
grains. The resulting dust extinction curve shows a good agreement with that
derived by observations of a reddened QSO at z =6.2. Stochastic heating of
small grains leads to a wide distribution of dust temperatures. This supports
the idea that large amounts (~ 0.1 M_sun) of cold dust (T ~ 40K) can be present
in SN remnants, without being in conflict with the observed IR emission.

running coupling corrections calculated recently significantly change the shape
of the scaling function as compared to the fixed coupling case leading to a
considerable increase in the anomalous dimension and to a slow-down of the
evolution with rapidity. The difference between the two recent calculations is
due to an extra contribution to the evolution kernel, referred to as the
subtraction term, which arises when running coupling corrections are included.
These subtraction terms were neglected in both recent calculations. We evaluate
numerically the subtraction terms for both calculations, and demonstrate that
when the subtraction terms are added back to the evolution kernels obtained in
the two works the resulting dipole amplitudes agree with each other! We then
use the complete running coupling kernel including the subtraction term to find
the numerical solution of the resulting full non-linear evolution equation with
the running coupling corrections. Again the scaling regime is recovered at very
large rapidity.

properties have been obtained comparing the observations with self-consistent
disk models for the dust and CO emission. The circumstellar disk is resolved
both in the continuum and in CO. We find strong evidence that the circumstellar
material is in Keplerian rotation around a central star of 2.6 Msun. The disk
inclination with respect to the line of sight is 46+-4 deg with a position
angle of 128+-4 deg. The slope of the dust opacity measured between 0.87 and 7
mm (beta=1) confirms the presence of mm/cm-size grains in the disk midplane.
The dust continuum emission is asymmetric and confined inside a radius of 200
AU while the CO emission extends up to 540 AU. The comparison between dust and
CO temperature indicates that CO is present only in the disk interior. Finally,
we obtain an increasing depletion of CO isotopomers from 12CO to 13CO and C18O.
We argue that these results support the idea that the disk of HD 163296 is
strongly evolved. In particular, we suggest that there is a strong depletion of
dust relative to gas outside 200 AU; this may be due to the inward migration of
large bodies that form in the outer disk or to clearing of a large gap in the
dust distribution by a low mass companion.

is more important in determining the shapes of the Stokes V profiles than the
phase of the wave, contrary to what our simulations show. We also find that
Stokes V asymmetries are very common in the network, and the histograms of the

analyze the search reach of the CMS experiment for the heavy neutral MSSM Higgs
bosons with an integrated luminosity of 30 or 60 fb^-1. This is done by
combining the latest results for the CMS experimental sensitivities based on
full simulation studies with state-of-the-art theoretical predictions of MSSM
Higgs-boson properties. The results are interpreted in MSSM benchmark scenarios
in terms of the parameters tan_beta and the Higgs-boson mass scale, M_A. We
study the dependence of the 5 sigma discovery contours in the M_A-tan_beta
plane on variations of the other supersymmetric parameters. The largest effects
arise from a change in the higgsino mass parameter mu, which enters both via
higher-order radiative corrections and via the kinematics of Higgs decays into
supersymmetric particles. While the variation of $\mu$ can shift the
prospective discovery reach (and correspondingly the ``LHC wedge'' region) by
about Delta tan_beta = 10, we find that the discovery reach is rather stable
with respect to the impact of other supersymmetric parameters. Within the
discovery region we analyze the accuracy with which the masses of the heavy
neutral Higgs bosons can be determined. We find that an accuracy of 1-4% should
be achievable, which could make it possible in favourable regions of the MSSM
parameter space to experimentally resolve the signals of the two heavy MSSM
Higgs bosons at the LHC.

conditions is analysed using a continuum Langevin model. If the
electromigration driving force acts in the step up/down direction, and
step-edge diffusion is the dominant mass-transport mechanism, we find that
significant deviations from the usual $t^{1/4}$ scaling of the terrace-width
correlation function occurs for a critical time $\tau$ which is dependent upon
the three energy scales in the problem: $k_{B}T$, the step stiffness, $\gamma$,
and the bias associated with adatom hopping under the influence of an
electromigration force, $\pm \Delta U$. For ($t < \tau$), the correlation
function evolves as a superposition of $t^{1/4}$ and $t^{3/4}$ power laws. For
$t \ge \tau$ a closed form expression can be derived. This behavior is
confirmed by a Monte-Carlo simulation using a discrete model of the step
dynamics. It is proposed that the magnitude of the electromigration force
acting upon an atom at a step-edge can by estimated by a careful analysis of
the statistical properties of step-edge fluctuations on the appropriate
time-scale.

goals: 1) detecting and characterizing low-mass planets increasingly similar to
the Earth, and 2) improving our understanding of planet formation. We present a
new planet detection method that is capable of making large advances towards
both of these objectives and describe a modest network of telescopes that is
able to make the requisite observations. In a system where a known planet
transits its host star, a second planet in that system will cause the time
between transits to vary. These transit timing variations can be used to infer
the orbital elements and mass of the perturbing planet even if it has a mass
that is smaller than the mass of the Earth. This detection technique
complements other techniques because it is most sensitive in mean-motion
resonances where, due to degeneracies, other techniques have reduced
sensitivity. Small ground-based observatories have already exceeded the
photometric precision necessary to detect sub-Earth mass planets. However, TTV
planet searches are currently limited by the relatively small number of
high-precision transit data and insufficient observing time on existing
telescopes. These issues will be compounded as the number of known transiting
planets suitable for TTV study will increase substantially in the near future.
A relatively modest investment in a ground-based network of small ($\sim 0.5
{\rm m}$ telescopes could provide the needed coverage and so dramatically
increase the effectiveness of transit timing observations.
","Moreover, our method could be used to test the transit timing of planetary systems, and thus to investigate the nature of new planetary systems.

results with real loop observations. We demonstrate that the procedure allows
us to distinguish constant width loops from loops that expand appreciably with
height, as predicted by simple force-free field models. This holds even for
loops near the resolution limit. The procedure can easily determine when loops
are below resolution limit and therefore not reliably measured. We find that
small-scale variations in the measured loop width are likely due to
imperfections in the background subtraction. The greatest errors occur in
especially narrow loops and in places where the background is especially bright
relative to the loop. We stress, however, that these effects do not impact the
ability to measure large-scale variations. The result that observed loops do
not expand systematically with height is robust.

rate of XMPGs suggests this is a powerful method for finding such populations.

observations presents a unique way to test certain features of string theory.
Current limit on the ratio of tensor to scalar perturbations, r=T/S, is r <
0.3, future detection may take place for r > 10^{-2}-10^{-3}. At present all
known string theory inflation models predict tensor modes well below the level
of detection. Therefore a possible experimental discovery of tensor modes may
present a challenge to string cosmology.
  The strongest bound on r in string inflation follows from the observation
that in most of the models based on the KKLT construction, the value of the
Hubble constant H during inflation must be smaller than the gravitino mass. For
the gravitino mass in the usual range, m_{3/2} < O(1) TeV, this leads to an
extremely strong bound r < 10^{-24}. A discovery of tensor perturbations with r
> 10^{-3} would imply that the gravitinos in this class of models are
superheavy, m_{3/2} > 10^{13} GeV. This would have important implications for
particle phenomenology based on string theory.
","The standard model of particle physics has been extremely successful at explaining the interactions between particles of up to the TeV scale, but it has not yet developed a coherent theory of gravity. Using this theoretical framework, we examine the possibilities of testing the theories of string theory and presenting indirect proofs of string theory, for example, for the existence of the extra dimensions, the cosmic strings, and the brane inflation. We compared the CMB maps with the latest Planck data. We found that the extra dimensions affect the power spectrum, while the cosmic strings influence the temperature and the polarity. We show that a certain repression of the CMB by brane inflation can be discerned in the temperature and the polarity of the CMB. The experimental results suggest that a recurrence of the extra dimensions may be felt on the CMB temperature and the polarity of the water. We study CMB maps by testing three key predictions. First, string theory predicts that the universe has extra dimensions beyond our four visible dimensions, which could be caused by distortions of the CMB. Second, the theory predicts that there may be cosmic strings—secular defects in the universe that have formed in the early phase transitions—that will be able to affect the CMB. Third, string theory predicts the existence of specific patterns in the CMB, a process which is termed ",0.4117647058823529,0.8888888888888888,0.2648648648648649,0.9540229885057471,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.09715941408575242,0.2413012304851471,0.09727626459143969,0.38961038961038963,0,1,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1

Use active voice.","  In this paper a theoretical model of functioning of a neural circuit during a
behavioral response has been proposed. A neural circuit can be thought of as a
directed multigraph whose each vertex is a neuron and each edge is a synapse.
It has been assumed in this paper that the behavior of such circuits is
manifested through the collective behavior of neurons belonging to that
circuit. Behavioral information of each neuron is contained in the coefficients
of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) over the output spike train. Those
coefficients form a vector in a multidimensional vector space. Behavioral
dynamics of a neuronal network in response to strong aversive stimuli has been
studied in a vector space in which a suitable pseudometric has been defined.
The neurodynamical model of network behavior has been formulated in terms of
existing memory, synaptic plasticity and feelings. The model has an analogy in
classical electrostatics, by which the notion of force and potential energy has
been introduced. Since the model takes input from each neuron in a network and
produces a behavior as the output, it would be extremely difficult or may even
be impossible to implement. But with the help of the model a possible
explanation for an hitherto unexplained neurological observation in human brain
has been offered. The model is compatible with a recent model of sequential
behavioral dynamics. The model is based on electrophysiology, but its relevance
to hemodynamics has been outlined.

of supernova (SN) feedback and study how galactic winds from star-forming
galaxies affect the features of hydrogen (HI) and metal (CIV and OVI)
absorption systems in the intergalactic medium at high redshift. We find that
the outflows tend to escape to low density regions, and hardly affect the dense
filaments visible in HI absorption. As a result, the strength of HI absorption
near galaxies is not reduced by galactic winds, but even slightly increases. We
also find that a lack of HI absorption for lines of sight (LOS) close to
galaxies, as found by Adelberger et al., can be created by hot gas around the
galaxies induced by accretion shock heating. In contrast to HI, metal
absorption systems are sensitive to the presence of winds. The models without
feedback can produce the strong CIV and OVI absorption lines in LOS within 50
kpc from galaxies, while strong SN feedback is capable of creating strong CIV
and OVI lines out to about twice that distance. We also analyze the mean
transmissivity of HI, CIV, and OVI within 1 h$^{-1}$ Mpc from star-forming
galaxies. The probability distribution of the transmissivity of HI is
independent of the strength of SN feedback, but strong feedback produces LOS
with lower transmissivity of metal lines. Additionally, strong feedback can
produce strong OVI lines even in cases where HI absorption is weak. We conclude
that OVI is probably the best tracer for galactic winds at high redshift.

close to the DLA line where the background quasar emission is absorbed. In

candidates have similar line fluxes and line widths, while velocity offsets

flux-limited sample. We find that at least 90% of quasars are variable at the
0.03 mag level (rms) and confirm that variability is as good a method for
finding low-redshift quasars as is the UV excess color selection (at high
Galactic latitudes). We analyze the distribution of lightcurve skewness for
quasars and find that is centered on zero. We find that about 1/4 of the
variable stars are RR Lyrae stars, and that only 0.5% of stars from the main
stellar locus are variable at the 0.05 mag level. The distribution of
lightcurve skewness in the g-r vs. u-g color-color diagram on the main stellar
locus is found to be bimodal (with one mode consistent with Algol-like
behavior). Using over six hundred RR Lyrae stars, we demonstrate rich halo
substructure out to distances of 100 kpc. We extrapolate these results to

from in situ observations of He^O, pickup ions and anomalous cosmic rays in the

begin with accurate density-functional-theory calculations for electronic

encountered in the equilibrium and stretched forms. These results are
complemented by semi-empirical quantum mechanical calculations for the states
of a small size [18 base pair poly(CG)-poly(CG)] dry, neutral DNA sequence,

states are then used to parametrize an effective tight-binding model that can
describe electron hopping in the presence of environmental effects, such as the
presence of stray water molecules on the backbone or structural features of the
substrate. These effects introduce disorder in the model hamiltonian which
leads to electron localization. The localization length is smaller by several

dissociate in the latter two stages. Dissociation of ccbar in the medium occurs
via two reactions: (a) color singlet ccbar plus a gluon turns to color octet
ccbar, (b) color octet ccbar plus a gluon persists as color octet. There are
modest yields of ccbar in the prethermal stage at RHIC energy and through the
reactions ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J] at LHC energy for partons with large average

suppression of the initial yield in the deconfined medium. Consequently, a

the ratio of J/psi number distributions for Au-Au collisions to nucleon-nucleon

to a harmonic oscillator. We further generalize this formalism to take into
account the bulk viscosity and other cases. The Hamiltonian can be quantized

transmission that occurs in a parallel array of independently noisy identical
threshold nonlinearities, including model neurons. Unlike most forms of
stochastic resonance, the output response to suprathreshold random input
signals of arbitrary magnitude is improved by the presence of even small
amounts of noise. In this paper the information transmission performance of SSR
in the limit of a large array size is considered. Using a relationship between
Shannon's mutual information and Fisher information, a sufficient condition for
optimality, i.e. channel capacity, is derived. It is shown that capacity is
achieved when the signal distribution is Jeffrey's prior, as formed from the
noise distribution, or when the noise distribution depends on the signal
distribution via a cosine relationship. These results provide theoretical
verification and justification for previous work in both computational
neuroscience and electronics.
","The aim of our study was to investigate the optimal stimulus and noise distribution of the signal transmitted by subthreshold and suprathreshold oscillations. The subthreshold oscillations were, in fact, not identical in nature. The optimal stimulus amplitude and noise strength were measured, and they were compared with the optimal strength of the signal. The results of our study were that the optimal stimulus and noise distributions for subthreshold and suprathreshold oscillations were, in fact, quite different. In the subthreshold, the optimal amplitude of the signal was fixed at the threshold, in the suprathreshold, it was above the threshold. We found that the optimal stimulus and noise distribution was determined to a considerable extent by the combination of multiple noise distributions. In our study, we have examined the optimal SNR of a system in the upper and lower ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum. The main purpose of this research was to establish the optimal parameters of a system capable of transmitting and detecting weak signals in both subthreshold and upper ranges.

between the orientation of a satellite galaxy and the direction towards its
BGG, and direct alignment between the orientation of the BGG and that of its
satellites. In agreement with previous studies we find that satellite galaxies
are preferentially located along the major axis. In addition, on scales r < 0.7
Rvir we find that red satellites are preferentially aligned radially with the

  Results: Our observations reveal that BD+43 3654 is a very early and luminous
star of spectral type O4If, with an estimated mass of (70 +/- 15) solar masses
and an age of about 1.6 Myr. The high spatial resolution of the MSX
observations allows us to determine its direction of motion in the plane of the
sky by means of the symmetry axis of the well-defined bow shock, which matches
well the orientation expected from the proper motion. Tracing back its path
across the sky we find that BD+43 3654 was located near the central, densest
region of Cygnus OB2 at a time in the past similar to its estimated age.
  Conclusions: BD+43 3654 turns out to be one of the three most massive runaway
stars known, and it most likely formed in the central region of Cygnus OB2. A
runaway formation mechanism by means of dynamical ejection is consistent with
our results.

flavor democratic structure to the fermion mass generation sector. It is found
that at least two iso-singlet scalar fields with imposed a discrete symmetry
are necessary to generate CP violation due to the appearance of the relative
phase between their vacuum expectation values.
  In the simplest model, ratios of quark masses and the
Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix including the CP violating phase are
determined by the CKM element |V_{us}| and the ratio of two vacuum expectation
values R=|R|e^{i*alpha} (a magnitude and a phase). It is demonstrated how the
angles phi_i (i=1--3) of the unitarity triangle and the CKM off-diagonal
elements |V_{ub}| and |V_{cb}| are predicted as a function of |V_{us}|, |R| and

with the experimental data within the simplest model, the basic idea of our
scenario would be promising to construct a more realistic model of flavor and
CP violation.

when $M$ tends to infinity while the total energy of the system is bounded and
the number of gas particles is fixed. Neishtadt and Sinai previously pointed
out that an averaging theorem due to Anosov should extend to this situation.

convergence is uniform over all initial conditions in a compact set. We also

The Green's tensor approach permits computation of the phase and amplitude

shown that the field diffracted along the interface by the groove is equivalent
to replacing the groove by an oscillating dipolar line source. An analytic
expression is derived from the Green's function formalism, that reproduces well
the asymptotic surface plasmon polariton (SPP) wave as well as the transient
surface wave in the near-zone close to the groove. The agreement between this
model and the full simulation is very good, showing that the transient
""near-zone"" regime does not depend on the precise shape of the groove. Finally,
it is shown that a composite diffractive evanescent wave model that includes
the asymptotic SPP can describe the wavelength evolution in this transient
near-zone. Such a semi-analytical model may be useful for the design and

","The study has been carried out by the fundamental assumption that SPPs have attracted great interest because of their unique properties, which render them suitable for a wide range of applications, such as sensors, optical devices, and plasmonic waveguides. Therefore, in order to determine the behavior of SPPs in the vicinity of subwavelengths, it is necessary to study the behaviour of the subwavelengths and to derive a certain insight into the transient behavior of SPPs. In this way, it is essential to understand the behavior of SPPs in subwavelengths and to determine the relative distribution of their lengths and wavelengths. This research contributes to the advance of plasmonic devices and opens new possibilities for designing and constructing plasmonic devices. Moreover, our research indicates that the transient behavior of the SPPs is greatly affected by the position of the subwavelength and the direction of the SPPs, and that a substantial increase in the amplitude of the SPPs is obtained by varying the width of the groove with the wavelength of the SPPs. This increase in the amplitude of the transient behaviour is due to the increased Fabry-Perot resonances of the SPPs and the grooves.

the \emph{a priori} unknown shape of an inclusion $\omega$ inside a body
$\Omega$ from boundary measurement. This inverse problem - known as electrical
impedance tomography - has many important practical applications and hence has
focussed much attention during the last years. However, to our best knowledge,
no work has yet considered a second order approach for this problem. This paper
aims to fill that void: we investigate the existence of second order derivative
of the state $u$ with respect to perturbations of the shape of the interface
$\partial\omega$, then we choose a cost function in order to recover the
geometry of $\partial \omega$ and derive the expression of the derivatives
needed to implement the corresponding Newton method. We then investigate the
stability of the process and explain why this inverse problem is severely
ill-posed by proving the compactness of the Hessian at the global minimizer.
","At the beginning, we have a certain amount of realism. The image of an object is often distorted, which leads to a misunderstanding and confusion. This is a major advancement in the field of electric interference. In the future, we are going to improve the accuracy of the images, and this is where our work will be a major breakthrough. We present a method for maximizing the shape of an object, based on the finite element method, which solves the inverse problem of the electric interference. Moreover, we will present a few experimental results that show the success of the method. Besides, the accuracy of the images is not always as good as the original, and it is often difficult to determine the exact shape of the object, and the result is a more accurate diagnosis and control. In this study, we will discuss the development of a second-order shape optimization method. The main idea is that we can optimize the shape of the object being scanned by using the second-order shape optimization algorithm.

this system can be chaotic when the gravitational contribution from a surface
density of a disk is comparable with that from a point mass. In such an orbit,
we sometimes find that there appears a phase of the orbit in which particle
motion becomes to be nearly regular (the so-called ``stagnant motion'') for a
finite time interval between more strongly chaotic phases. To study how these
different chaotic behaviours affect on observation of gravitational waves, we
investigate a correlation of the particle motion and the waves. We find that
such a difference in chaotic motions reflects on the wave forms and energy
spectra. The character of the waves in the stagnant motion is quite different
from that either in a regular motion or in a more strongly chaotic motion. This
suggests that we may make a distinction between different chaotic behaviours of
the orbit via the gravitational waves.

suggested that the power spectral density (PSD) of NGC 3783 flattens to a slope
near zero at low frequencies, in a similar manner to that of Galactic black
hole X-ray binary systems (GBHs) in the `hard' state. The low radio flux
emitted by this object, however, is inconsistent with a hard state
interpretation. The accretion rate of NGC 3783 (~7% of the Eddington rate) is
similar to that of other AGN with `soft' state PSDs and higher than that at
which the GBH Cyg X-1, with which AGN are often compared, changes between
`hard' and `soft' states (~2% of the Eddington rate). If NGC 3783 really does
have a `hard' state PSD, it would be quite unusual and would indicate that AGN
and GBHs are not quite as similar as we currently believe. Here we present an
improved X-ray PSD of NGC 3783, spanning from ~10^{-8} to ~10^{-3} Hz, based on
considerably extended (5.5 years) RXTE observations combined with two orbits of
continuous observation by XMM-Newton. We show that this PSD is, in fact, well
fitted by a `soft' state model which has only one break, at high frequencies.
Although a `hard' state model can also fit the data, the improvement in fit by
adding a second break at low frequency is not significant. Thus NGC 3783 is not
unusual. These results leave Arakelian 564 as the only AGN which shows a second
break at low frequencies, although in that case the very high accretion rate
implies a `very high', rather than `hard' state PSD. The break frequency found
in NGC 3783 is consistent with the expectation based on comparisons with other
AGN and GBHs, given its black hole mass and accretion rate.

The X-ray observations, taken over the period of thirteen years, show that the AGN is in its most active phase, and that, therefore, it must be accurately investigated. We do so by studying the periodic variations in the X-ray light curve of the AGN. This analysis shows the importance of timing, which has unique information on the physical properties of AGNs.

makes it exceedingly difficult for routers to examine every packet in order to
keep detailed statistics about the traffic which is traversing the router.
Sampling is commonly applied on routers in order to limit the load incurred by
the collection of information that the router has to undertake when evaluating
flow information for monitoring purposes. The sampling process in nearly all
cases is a deterministic process of choosing 1 in every N packets on a
per-interface basis, and then forming the flow statistics based on the
collected sampled statistics. Even though this sampling may not be significant
for some statistics, such as packet rate, others can be severely distorted.
However, it is important to consider the sampling techniques and their relative
accuracy when applied to different traffic patterns. The main disadvantage of
sampling is the loss of accuracy in the collected trace when compared to the
original traffic stream. To date there has not been a detailed analysis of the
impact of sampling at a router in various traffic profiles and flow criteria.
In this paper, we assess the performance of the sampling process as used in
NetFlow in detail, and we discuss some techniques for the compensation of loss
of monitoring detail.

state, i.e. a state in which the properties of the global system are well
defined but the properties of each subsystem are not. Entanglement is at the
heart of quantum physics, both for its conceptual foundations and for
applications in information processing and quantum communication. Remarkably,
entanglement can be ""swapped"": if one prepares two independent entangled pairs
A1-A2 and B1-B2, a joint measurement on A1 and B1 (called a ""Bell-State
Measurement"", BSM) has the effect of projecting A2 and B2 onto an entangled
state, although these two particles have never interacted or shared any common
past[1,2]. Experiments using twin photons produced by spontaneous parametric
down-conversion (SPDC) have already demonstrated entanglement swapping[3-6],
but here we present its first realization using continuous wave (CW) sources,
as originally proposed[2]. The challenge was to achieve sufficiently sharp
synchronization of the photons in the BSM. Using narrow-band filters, the
coherence time of the photons that undergo the BSM is significantly increased,
exceeding the temporal resolution of the detectors. Hence pulsed sources can be
replaced by CW sources, which do not require any synchronization[6,7], allowing
for the first time the use of completely autonomous sources. Our experiment
exploits recent progress in the time precision of photon detectors, in the
efficiency of photon pair production by SPDC with waveguides in nonlinear
crystals[8], and in the stability of narrow-band filters. This approach is
independent of the form of entanglement; we employed time-bin entangled
photons[9] at telecom wavelengths. Our setup is robust against thermal or
mechanical fluctuations in optical fibres thanks to cm-long coherence lengths.

The key idea is that time is the resource for entanglement. In this work, we introduce a method for entangling independent photons by using the time of the beam splitter. By adjusting the time of the beam, we induced the state of entangled particles to violate the Bell inequality. Our method has important implications for the study of information and communication, for it allows the entangled states of different nodes to be found in different light sources.

``nonlocal'', we show that by using appropriately retarded wavefunctions (i.e.,
the locality loophole) this local model can violate Bell's inequality, without
making any appeal to detector inefficiencies.
  We analyze a possible experimental configuration appropriate to massive
two-particle singlet wavefunctions and find that as long as the particles are
not ultra-relativistic, a locality loophole exists and Dirac wave(s) can
propagate from Alice or Bob's changing magnetic field, through space, to the
other detector, arriving before the particle and thereby allowing a local
interpretation to the 2-particle de Broglie-Bohm trajectories.
  We also propose a physical effect due to changing magnetic fields in a
Stern-Gerlach EPR setup that will throw away events and create a detector
loophole in otherwise perfectly efficient detectors, an effect that is only
significant for near-luminal particles that might otherwise close the locality
loophole.
","As we have already stated, the present work is in the process of elucidating the importance of considering the entanglement of particles in the physics of a system. In this way we have developed a method to analyse the trajectories of particles in a system governed by an entangled wavefunction. Our method is based on the interpretation of the wavefunction as a potential, which guides the movement of the particles. We use this method to obtain the spatial trajectories of particles in a system governed by a entangled wavefunction. We present numerical simulations of the initial states and show that the entangled state leads to a non-linearity of the probability density and the trajectories of the particles. We show that the particles can be guided by the entangled state in different ways, in contrast to the one that does not entangle. In this work we develop a method for estimating the spatial trajectories of the particles in a simple system, governed by an entangled wavefunction. We present a method to calculate the trajectories of the particles in a simple, compact system, based on the de Broglie-Bohm theory. The entangled wavefunction is a superposition of two entangled states with different phases.

particular cool planets at or beyond the snowline, very low-mass (i.e.
terrestrial) planets, planets orbiting low-mass stars, free-floating planets,
and even planets in external galaxies. Such planets can provide critical
constraints on models of planet formation, and therefore the next generation of
extrasolar planet searches should include an aggressive and well-funded
microlensing component. When combined with the results from other complementary

low-mass terrestrial planets.

By comparison, interactions between related stocks, e.g., those belonging to

identity in emerging markets is explicitly shown by reconstructing the network
of mutually interacting stocks. Spectral analysis of C for NSE reveals that,
the few largest eigenvalues deviate from the bulk of the spectrum predicted by
random matrix theory, but they are far fewer in number compared to, e.g., NYSE.

classifiers to M_V=-18. These morphological classifications are compared to
local galaxy density, distance from the nearest cluster centre, local surface
mass density from weak lensing, and photometric classification. At high local
galaxy densities, log(Sigma_10 /Mpc^2) > 1.5, a classical morphology-density
relation is found. A correlation is also found between morphology and local
projected surface mass density, but no trend is observed with distance to the
nearest cluster. This supports the finding that local environment is more
important to galaxy morphology than global cluster properties. The breakdown of
the morphological catalogue by colour shows a dominance of blue galaxies in the
galaxies displaying late-type morphologies and a corresponding dominance of red
galaxies in the early-type population. Using the 17-band photometry from
COMBO-17, we further split the supercluster red sequence into old passive
galaxies and galaxies with young stars and dust according to the prescription
of Wolf et al. (2005). We find that the dusty star-forming population describes
an intermediate morphological group between late-type and early-type galaxies,
supporting the hypothesis that field and group spiral galaxies are transformed

constraint-preserving boundary conditions of Kreiss and Winicour. Rather

spectral fitting is reliable only for fitting models with 2 or 3 parameters. As
high uncertainty and correlation among the errors is expected, a careful
analysis of the errors is necessary. We fit both the power law (PL, 2

time-integrated spectra of the 47 bursts, and present the corresponding
parameters, their uncertainties, and the correlations among the uncertainties.
The CPL model is reliable only for 29 bursts for which we estimate the nuf_nu

uncertainties and correlations among them. We explore the distribution of our

correlation between star formation rate and gas surface or volume density,
depend on the molecular line chosen to trace the gas. We show that, for lines
that can be excited at low temperatures, the KS law depends on how the line
critical density compares to the median density in a galaxy's star-forming
molecular clouds. High critical density lines trace regions with similar
physical properties across galaxy types, and this produces a linear correlation
between line luminosity and star formation rate. Low critical density lines
probe regions whose properties vary across galaxies, leading to a star
formation rate that varies superlinearly with line luminosity. We show that a
simple model in which molecular clouds are treated as isothermal and homogenous
can quantitatively reproduce the observed correlations between galactic
luminosities in far infrared and in the CO(1->0) and HCN(1->0) lines, and
naturally explains why these correlations have different slopes. We predict
that IR-line luminosity correlations should change slope for galaxies in which
the median density is close to the line critical density. This prediction may
be tested by observations of lines such as HCO^+(1->0) with intermediate
critical densities, or by HCN(1->0) observations of intensely star-forming high
redshift galaxies with very high densities. Recent observations by Gao et al.
hint at just such a change in slope. We argue that deviations from linearity in
the HCN(1->0)-IR correlation at high luminosity are consistent with the
assumption of a constant star formation efficiency.

We used a methodological approach to obtaining data from a variety of galaxies and applying statistical techniques to establish the relationship between methanol and the rate of star formation. In our analysis, we found that methanol and the rate of star formation were positively related, and we established that the ratio of methanol and the rate of star formation was at least two-fold that of methanol. This method of calculation was used to calculate the molecular gas content of the galaxies, and so is indispensable for the study of star formation. In this study, we exploit public data in order to determine the methanol content and the SFR per unit area. We also examine the relationship between the SFR and the KERN.

pseudoscalar mesons in partially quenched staggered chiral perturbation theory
(\schpt), working to leading order in $1/m_Q$, where $m_Q$ is the heavy quark
mass. We take the light meson in the final state to be a pseudoscalar
corresponding to the exact chiral symmetry of staggered quarks. The treatment
assumes the validity of the standard prescription for representing the
staggered ``fourth root trick'' within \schpt by insertions of factors of 1/4
for each sea quark loop. Our calculation is based on an existing partially
quenched continuum chiral perturbation theory calculation with degenerate sea
quarks by Becirevic, Prelovsek and Zupan, which we generalize to the staggered
(and non-degenerate) case. As a by-product, we obtain the continuum partially
quenched results with non-degenerate sea quarks. We analyze the effects of
non-leading chiral terms, and find a relation among the coefficients governing
the analytic valence mass dependence at this order. Our results are useful in
analyzing lattice computations of form factors $B\to\pi$ and $D\to K$ when the
light quarks are simulated with the staggered action.
","It is essential to understand the behavior of hadrons, especially the dynamics of their gluons.

recovers information about fluctuations lost in passing to the reduced density
matrix. For the case of fluctuations arising from a classical probability
distribution, the hierarchy is formed from expectations of products of pure
state density matrix elements, and can be compactly summarized by a simple
generating function. For the case of quantum fluctuations arising when a
quantum system interacts with a quantum environment in an overall pure state,
the corresponding hierarchy is defined as the environmental trace of products
of system matrix elements of the full density matrix. Only the lowest member of
the quantum noise hierarchy is directly experimentally measurable. The unit
trace and idempotence properties of the pure state density matrix imply descent
relations for the tensor hierarchies, that relate the order $n$ tensor, under
contraction of appropriate pairs of tensor indices, to the order $n-1$ tensor.
As examples to illustrate the classical probability distribution formalism, we
consider a quantum system evolving by It\^o stochastic and by jump process
Schr\""odinger equations. As examples to illustrate the corresponding trace
formalism in the quantum fluctuation case, we consider collisional Brownian
motion of an infinite mass Brownian particle, and the weak coupling Born-Markov
master equation. In different specializations, the latter gives the hierarchies
generalizing the quantum optical master equation and the Caldeira--Leggett
master equation. As a further application of the density tensor, we contrast
stochastic Schr\""odinger equations that reduce and that do not reduce the state
vector, and discuss why a quantum system coupled to a quantum environment
behaves like the latter.
","He then drew upon the underlying noise to find the causes of this dreary state. We now present a new framework to study the behavior of open quantum systems, whose evolution is often disturbed by external disturbances.

This hierarchy has the benefit of capturing the details of the noise processes which underlie the dynamics of the system.

spin evolution of Low Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs) are modeled using the triplet
of modes at the lowest parametric instability threshold. We solve numerically
the coupled equations for the three mode amplitudes in conjunction with the
spin and temperature evolution equations. We observe that very quickly the mode
amplitudes settle into quasi-stationary states. Once these states are reached,
the mode amplitudes can be found algebraically and the system of equations is
reduced from eight to two equations: spin and temperature evolution.
Eventually, the system may reach thermal equilibrium and either (1) undergo a
cyclic evolution with a frequency change of at most 10%, (2) evolve toward a
full equilibrium state in which the accretion torque balances the gravitational
radiation emission, or (3) enter a thermogravitational runaway on a very long
timescale of about $10^6$ years. Alternatively, a faster thermal runaway
(timescale of about 100 years) may occur. The sources of damping considered are
shear viscosity, hyperon bulk viscosity and boundary layer viscosity. We vary
proprieties of the star such as the hyperon superfluid transition temperature
T_c, the fraction of the star that is above the threshold for direct URCA
reactions, and slippage factor, and map the different scenarios we obtain to
ranges of these parameters. For all our bound evolutions the r-mode amplitude
remains small $\sim 10^{-5}$. The spin frequency is limited by boundary layer
viscosity to $\nu_{max} \sim 800 Hz [S_{ns}/(M_{1.4} R_6)]^{4/11} T_8^{-2/11}$.
We find that for $\nu > 700$ Hz the r-mode instability would be active for
about 1 in 1000 LMXBs and that only the gravitational waves from LMXBs in the
local group of galaxies could be detected by advanced LIGO interferometers.

map intrinsically large structures; to gain the necessary statistics to address
some problems; and to find very rare objects. I summarise major recent wide
field surveys - 2MASS, SDSS, 2dfGRS, and UKIDSS - and look at examples of the
exciting science they have produced, covering the structure of the Milky Way,
the measurement of cosmological parameters, the creation of a new field
studying substellar objects, and the ionisation history of the Universe. I then
look briefly at upcoming projects in the optical-IR survey arena - VISTA,
PanSTARRS, WISE, and LSST. Finally I ask, now we have opened up essentially all
wavelength windows, whether the exploration of survey discovery space is ended.
I examine other possible axes of discovery space, and find them mostly to be
too expensive to explore or otherwise unfruitful, with two exceptions : the
first is the time axis, which we have only just begun to explore properly; and
the second is the possibility of neutrino astrophysics.

1999. The spectra were calibrated in wavelength and in flux. A definition of
the pseudo-continuum level is found for all our observations. We also define a
continuum level for calibration purposes. The equivalent width of the D lines
is computed in detail for all our spectra and related to the colour index (B-V)
of the stars. When possible, we perform a careful comparison with previous
studies. Finally, we construct a spectral index (R_D') as the ratio between the
flux in the D lines, and the bolometric flux. We find that, once corrected for
the photospheric contribution, this index can be used as a chromospheric
activity indicator in stars with a high level of activity. Additionally, we
find that combining some of our results, we obtain a method to calibrate in

coefficient within the ring is assumed to follow a power law dependence with

position-velocity diagrams for the most intense maser features, for different
values of the exponent q. We have found that, depending on the value of q,
these diagrams can be qualitatively different. The most intense maser emission
at a given velocity can either come mainly from regions close to the inner or
outer edges of the amplifying ring or from the line perpendicular to the line
of sight and passing through the central mass (as is commonly assumed).
Particularly, when q>1 the position-velocity diagram is qualitatively similar
to the one observed for the water maser emission in the nucleus of the galaxy

the absorption coefficient depends on the radius of the amplifying ring as a
decreasing function, in order to have significant emission coming from the

and the blue straggler frequency. NGC 5466 has a very shallow mass function,
consistent with large mass loss and recently-discovered tidal tails. The blue
straggler sample is significantly more centrally concentrated than the HB or
RGB stars. We see no evidence of an upturn in the blue straggler frequency at
large distances from the center. Dynamical friction timescales indicate that
the stragglers should be more concentrated if the cluster's present density
structure has existed for most of its history. NGC 5466 also has an unusually
low central density compared to clusters of similar luminosity. In spite of
this, the specific frequency of blue stragglers that puts it right on the
frequency -- cluster M_V relation observed for other clusters.

in superconductors with honeycomb and kagome pinning arrays. We find that a
variety of novel vortex crystal states can be stabilized at integer and
fractional matching field densities. The honeycomb and kagome pinning arrays
produce considerably more pronounced commensuration peaks in the critical
depinning force than triangular pinning arrays, and also cause additional peaks
at noninteger matching fields where a portion of the vortices are located in
the large interstitial regions of the pinning lattices. For the honeycomb
pinning array, we find matching effects of equal strength at most fillings
B/B_\phi=n/2 for n>2, where n is an integer, in agreement with recent
experiments. For kagome pinning arrays, pronounced matching effects generally
occur at B/B_\phi=n/3 for n>3, while for triangular pinning arrays pronounced
matching effects are observed only at integer fillings B/B_\phi=n. At the
noninteger matching field peaks in the honeycomb and kagome pinning arrays, the
interstitial vortices are arranged in dimer, trimer, and higher order n-mer
states that have an overall orientational order. We call these n-mer states
""vortex molecular crystals"" and ""vortex plastic crystals"" since they are
similar to the states recently observed in colloidal molecular crystal systems.
We argue that the vortex molecular crystals have properties in common with
certain spin systems such as Ising and n-state Potts models. We show that
kagome and honeycomb pinning arrays can be useful for increasing the critical
current above that of purely triangular pinning arrays.

questions on the formation of giant planets and the possibility of the
existence of smaller bodies in such dynamically complex environments. The
diverse dynamical characteristics of these objects have made scientists wonder
to what extent the current theories of planet formation can be applied to
binaries and multiple star systems. At present, the sensitivity of the
detection techniques does not allow routine discovery of Earth-sized bodies in
binary systems. However, with the advancement of new techniques, and with the
recent launch of CoRoT and the launch of Kepler in late 2008, the detection of
more planets (possibly terrestrial-class objects) in such systems is on the

where $n$ is the coded sequence length, as long as $k = o(n^{1/3})$. Otherwise,
for $k = O(n)$, the total average sequence redundancy is $O(n^{1/3+\epsilon})$
bits overall. We then show that there exists a sub-class of monotonic
distributions over infinite alphabets for which redundancy of
$O(n^{1/3+\epsilon})$ bits overall is still achievable. This class contains
fast decaying distributions, including many distributions over the integers and
geometric distributions. For some slower decays, including other distributions
over the integers, redundancy of $o(n)$ bits overall is achievable, where a
method to compute specific redundancy rates for such distributions is derived.
The results are specifically true for finite entropy monotonic distributions.
Finally, we study individual sequence redundancy behavior assuming a sequence
is governed by a monotonic distribution. We show that for sequences whose
empirical distributions are monotonic, individual redundancy bounds similar to
those in the average case can be obtained. However, even if the monotonicity in
the empirical distribution is violated, diminishing per symbol individual
sequence redundancies with respect to the monotonic maximum likelihood
description length may still be achievable.

We propose an efficient and precise coding method for a large variety of data, including audio, images and text signals. The proposed method is based on a novel theorem that the entropy of such monotonic distributions is monotonically decreasing. This property allows us to obtain a codebook with an order of complexity of O(log N) bits per sample, where N is the length of the monotonic sequence. Then, we show that our coding method is superior to other coding methods for a fast- decaying monotony. This approach is of use in several scientific and engineering fields.

magnitude lower than previous limits. Although I Zw 18 is starbursting, it has
a CO luminosity similar to or less than nearby low-mass irregulars (e.g. NGC
1569, the SMC, and NGC 6822). There is less CO in I Zw 18 relative to its
B-band luminosity, HI mass, or star formation rate than in spiral or dwarf
starburst galaxies (including the nearby dwarf starburst IC 10). Comparing the
star formation rate to our CO upper limit reveals that unless molecular gas
forms stars much more efficiently in I Zw 18 than in our own galaxy, it must

elliptical galaxies was a major surprise in 1969. While it is now clear that
this UV excess is caused by an old population of hot helium-burning stars
without large hydrogen-rich envelopes, rather than young stars, their origin
has remained a mystery. Here we show that these stars most likely lost their
envelopes because of binary interactions, similar to the hot subdwarf
population in our own Galaxy. We have developed an evolutionary population
synthesis model for the far-UV excess of elliptical galaxies based on the
binary model developed by Han et al (2002, 2003) for the formation of hot
subdwarfs in our Galaxy. Despite its simplicity, it successfully reproduces
most of the properties of elliptical galaxies with a UV excess: the range of
observed UV excesses, both in $(1550-V)$ and $(2000-V)$, and their evolution
with redshift. We also present colour-colour diagrams for use as diagnostic
tools in the study of elliptical galaxies. The model has major implications for
understanding the evolution of the UV excess and of elliptical galaxies in
general. In particular, it implies that the UV excess is not a sign of age, as
had been postulated previously, and predicts that it should not be strongly
dependent on the metallicity of the population, but exists universally from
dwarf ellipticals to giant ellipticals.
","A binary-based model of the UV uplift in elliptical galaxies has been proposed, based on the hypothesis that a small population of hot, young stars contributes to the upward shift in the temperature of the galaxy.

known as IntraDay Variability, can be explained in at least some sources by a
source-extrinsic effect, in which the variations are interpreted as
scintillation of radio waves caused by the turbulent ISM of the Milky Way. One
of the most convincing observational arguments in favour of propagation-induced
variability is the so called annual modulation of the characteristic
variability time-scale, which is due to the orbital motion of the Earth. Data
for the recently discovered and highly variable IDV source J1128+5925 are
presented. We study the frequency and time dependence of the IDV in this
compact quasar. We measure the characteristic variability time-scale of the IDV
throughout the year, and analyze whether the observed changes in the
variability time-scale are consistent with annual modulation. We monitored the
flux density variability of J1128+5925 with dense time sampling between 2.7 and
10.45GHz with the 100m Effelsberg radio telescope of the MPIfR and with the 25m
Urumqi radio telescope. From ten observing sessions, we determine the
variability characteristics and time-scales. The observed pronounced changes of
the variability time-scale of J1128+5925 are modelled with an anisotropic
annual modulation model. The observed frequency dependence of the variation is
in good agreement with the prediction from interstellar scintillation. Adopting
a simple model for the annual modulation model and using also the frequency
dependence of the IDV, we derive a lower limit to the distance of the
scattering screen and an upper limit to the scintillating source size. The
latter is found to be consistent with the measured core size from VLBI.

been investigated by Cr K-edge Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS)
and X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) spectroscopies.
First-principles computations of the structural relaxation and of the XANES
spectrum have been performed, with a good agreement to the experiment. The Cr-O
distance is close to that in MgCr2O4, indicating a full relaxation of the first
neighbors, and the second shell of Al atoms relaxes partially. These
observations demonstrate that Vegard's law is not obeyed in the MgAl2O4-MgCr2O4
solid solution. Despite some angular site distortion, the local D3d symmetry of
the B-site of the spinel structure is retained during the substitution of Cr
for Al. Here, we show that the relaxation is accomodated by strain-induced bond
buckling, with angular tilts of the Mg-centred tetrahedra around the Cr-centred
octahedron. By contrast, there is no significant alteration of the angles
between the edge-sharing octahedra, which build chains aligned along the three
four-fold axes of the cubic structure.
","In the present work we are trying to determine the nature of the relaxation around a substitutional Cr3+ in MgAl2O4. This problem is a question of high importance in the field of technology, since it is a promising candidate for catalysis and superconductivity. This is a complex subject, and it is necessary to understand the function of the substitutional Cr3+ in the structure of the crystal. Our results show that the substitution of chromium for aluminum leads to a great relaxation of the neighbouring atoms, and the extinction of the bond length between Cr3+ and the oxygen, leading to local distortions that affect the magnetic and electronic properties of the crystal. Our study aims to clarify the function of the substituted Cr3+ in the crystal structure. We utilised DFT methods to calculate the elasticity of the crystal structure. The calculation of the density and elasticity of the crystal structure was made with the Vienna simulation, and all the results of the calculation were interpreted and interpreted in terms of the aforementioned properties.

of the science system. We observe that lower performance universities have a
larger size-dependent cumulative advantage for receiving citations than
top-performance universities. We also find that for the lower-performance
universities the fraction of not-cited publications decreases considerably with
size. Generally, the higher the average journal impact of the publications of a
university, the lower the number of not-cited publications. We find that the
average research performance does not dilute with size. Large top-performance
universities succeed in keeping a high performance over a broad range of
activities. This most probably is an indication of their scientific attractive
power. Next we find that particularly for the lower-performance universities
the field citation density provides a strong cumulative advantage in citations
per publication. The relation between number of citations and field citation

(BSNRs) observed in the radio band is determined mainly either by a non-uniform
interstellar medium (ISM) or by a non-uniform ambient magnetic field.
  METHODS: We perform 3-D MHD simulations of a spherical SNR shock propagating
through a magnetized ISM. Two cases of shock propagation are considered: 1)
through a gradient of ambient density with a uniform ambient magnetic field; 2)
through a homogeneous medium with a gradient of ambient magnetic field
strength. From the simulations, we synthesize the synchrotron radio emission,
making different assumptions about the details of acceleration and injection of
relativistic electrons.
  RESULTS: We find that asymmetric BSNRs are produced if the line-of-sight is
not aligned with the gradient of ambient plasma density or with the gradient of
ambient magnetic field strength. We derive useful parameters to quantify the
degree of asymmetry of the remnants that may provide a powerful diagnostic of
the microphysics of strong shock waves through the comparison between models
and observations.
  CONCLUSIONS: BSNRs with two radio limbs of different brightness can be
explained if a gradient of ambient density or, most likely, of ambient magnetic
field strength is perpendicular to the radio limbs. BSNRs with converging
similar radio arcs can be explained if the gradient runs between the two arcs.

The purpose of this research was to understand the complicated interplay between stars and their surroundings, and to uncover the fundamental elements in the processes that regulate them.

investigated. Due to the asymmetric topology, the synchronous patterns formed
in complex networks are irregular and nonstationary. For coupling strength
immediately out of the synchronizable region, the typical phenomenon is the
on-off intermittency of the system dynamics. The patterns appeared in this
process are signatured by the coexistence of a giant cluster, which comprises
most of the nodes, and a few number of small clusters. The pattern evolution is
characterized by the giant cluster irregularly absorbs or emits the small
clusters. As the coupling strength leaves away from the synchronization
bifurcation point, the giant cluster is gradually dissolved into a number of
small clusters, and the system dynamics is characterized by the integration and
separation of the small clusters. Dynamical mechanisms and statistical
properties of the nonstationary pattern evolution are analyzed and conducted,
and some scalings are newly revealed. Remarkably, it is found that the few
active nodes, which escape from the giant cluster with a high frequency, are
independent of the coupling strength while are sensitive to the bifurcation
types. We hope our findings about nonstationary pattern could give additional
understandings to the dynamics of complex systems and have implications to some
real problems where systems maintain their normal functions only in the
unsynchronizable state.
","ICT-based methods and methods are applied to this problem. The main idea of our research is that many complex networks are inherently non-stationary and have time-varying characteristics. The study of such networks is particularly important because of the fact that, like all other complex networks, they are not always so stationary, which leads to a significant challenge in understanding and modeling non-stationary behaviors. This is why our approach combines both theoretical and experimental methods to study the dynamics of un-stationary networks. Our result is that the non-stationary nature of networks is a result of the interplay of dynamical and static factors, and thus can be explained by the existence of non-stationary behaviors in complex networks. We develop an adaptive system that adjusts the dynamical and dynamical conditions of nodes in response to the changes in the environment, and investigates the effect of different combinations of interactions between nodes, and determines the consequences of such interactions. The results show that the network is dynamic and that the movement of nodes is influenced by the environment. This study aims to fill this gap by implementing a new, unified approach, which incorporates non-stationary effects in the dynamical structure of complex networks.

for non-Gaussian processes at the last scattering surface of the CMB to explain
the cold spot. The late integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, already seen
statistically for NVSS source counts, can now be seen to operate on a single
region. To create the magnitude and angular size of the WMAP cold spot requires
a ~140 Mpc radius completely empty void at z<=1 along this line of sight. This
is far outside the current expectations of the concordance cosmology, and adds
to the anomalies seen in the CMB.

tidal dwarfs, and merged cores; M51-type galaxies with disk spirals and tidal
arm companions; early-type galaxies with diffuse plumes; equal-mass
grazing-collisions; and thick J-shaped tails beaded with star formation and
double cores. One type is not common locally and is apparently a loose
assemblage of smaller galaxies. Photometric measurements were made of the tails
and clumps, and physical sizes were determined assuming photometric redshifts.
Antennae tails are a factor of ~3 smaller in GEMS and GOODS systems compared to
local antennae; their disks are a factor of ~2 smaller than locally. Collisions
among early type galaxies generally show no fine structure in their tails,
indicating that stellar debris is usually not unstable. One exception has a
5x10**9 Msun smooth red clump that could be a pure stellar condensation. Most
tidal dwarfs are blue and probably form by gravitational instabilities in the
gas. One tidal dwarf looks like it existed previously and was incorporated into
the arm tip by tidal forces. The star-forming regions in tidal arms are 10 to
1000 times more massive than star complexes in local galaxies, although their
separations are about the same. If they all form by gravitational
instabilities, then the gaseous velocity dispersions in interacting galaxies
have to be larger than in local galaxies by a factor of ~5 or more; the gas
column densities have to be larger by the square of this factor.

The results of this research are of interest to the researchers who study the formation and evolution of tidal tails in the GEOOD and in the GEMS fields. Using the Hubble Space Telescope, we investigated the morphology and structure of the galaxies to determine their properties. The results of this investigation showed that the presence of tidal tails in the host galaxies, as early as early as the first type, had more tidal tails. We found that the presence of tidal tails, in the first type, exhibited more tidal tails, and the latter was more tidal than the first type.

the energy barrier to that of a Stoner-Wohlfarth system with the same switching

for an optimal two-layer composite medium. A number of theoretical approaches
have been used for this problem (e.g., various numbers of coupled
Stoner-Wohlfarth layers and continuum micromagnetics). In this paper we show
that many of these approaches can be regarded as special cases or
approximations to a variational formulation of the problem, in which the energy
is minimized for fixed magnetization. The results can be easily visualized in
terms of a plot of the energy as a function of magnetic moment m_z, in which
both the switching field [the maximum slope of E(m_z)] and the stability
(determined by the energy barrier E_b) are geometrically visible. In this

be no higher than 4. We also show that a quadratic anistropy suggested by Suess

using this instrument for monitoring radial velocities of a large sample of
Solar-type stars (~1400 stars) in order to search for their possible low-mass
companions. Amongst the goals of our survey, one is to significantly increase
the number of detected extra-solar planets in a volume-limited sample to
improve our knowledge of their orbital elements distributions and thus obtain
better constraints for planet-formation models.
  In this paper, we present the HARPS radial-velocity data and orbital
solutions for 3 Solar-type stars: HD 100777, HD 190647, and HD 221287. The
radial-velocity data of HD 100777 is best explained by the presence of a 1.1
M_Jup planetary companion on a 384--day eccentric orbit (e=0.36). The orbital
fit obtained for the slightly evolved star HD 190647 reveals the presence of a
long-period (P=1038 d) 1.9 M_Jup planetary companion on a moderately eccentric
orbit (e=0.18). HD 221287 is hosting a 3.1 M_Jup planet on a 456--day orbit.
The shape of this orbit is not very well constrained because of our non-optimal
temporal coverage and because of the presence of abnormally large residuals. We
find clues for these large residuals to result from spectral line profile
variations probably induced by stellar activity related processes.

turns out that the diffuson and cooperon parts of the two-particle Green's

attractive s-wave reduced Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer interaction, while the

the critical temperature is {\it nonmonotonic} in the flux through the second

conductors tend to infinity, the behavior of normalized zeros near the central
point of families of L-functions agree with the N -> oo scaling limits of
eigenvalues near 1 of subgroups of U(N). Evidence for this has been found for
many families by studying the n-level densities; for suitably restricted test
functions the main terms agree with random matrix theory. In particular, all
one-parameter families of elliptic curves with rank r over Q(T) and the same
distribution of signs of functional equations have the same limiting behavior.
We break this universality and find family dependent lower order correction
terms in many cases; these lower order terms have applications ranging from
excess rank to modeling the behavior of zeros near the central point, and
depend on the arithmetic of the family. We derive an alternate form of the
explicit formula for GL(2) L-functions which simplifies comparisons, replacing
sums over powers of Satake parameters by sums of the moments of the Fourier
coefficients lambda_f(p). Our formula highlights the differences that we expect
to exist from families whose Fourier coefficients obey different laws (for
example, we expect Sato-Tate to hold only for non-CM families of elliptic
curves). Further, by the work of Rosen and Silverman we expect lower order
biases to the Fourier coefficients in families of elliptic curves with rank
over Q(T); these biases can be seen in our expansions. We analyze several
families of elliptic curves and see different lower order corrections,
depending on whether or not the family has complex multiplication, a forced
torsion point, or non-zero rank over Q(T).

moments to vanishing at the central point. There are now many results showing
agreement between the main terms of number theory and random matrix theory;
however, there are very few families where the lower order terms are known.
These terms often depend on subtle arithmetic properties of the family, and
provide a way to break the universality of behavior. The L-functions Ratios
Conjecture provides a powerful and tractable way to predict these terms. We
test a specific case here, that of the 1-level density for the symplectic
family of quadratic Dirichlet characters arising from even fundamental
discriminants d \le X. For test functions supported in (-1/3, 1/3) we calculate
all the lower order terms up to size O(X^{-1/2+epsilon}) and observe perfect
agreement with the conjecture (for test functions supported in (-1, 1) we show
agreement up to errors of size O(X^{-epsilon}) for any epsilon). Thus for this
family and suitably restricted test functions, we completely verify the Ratios
Conjecture's prediction for the 1-level density.

sample allows us to describe these trends accurately with tight linear
relations that are statistically robust against the uncertainty in the
isophotal shape measurements. There is also a host of significant correlations
between the disky fraction and indicators of nuclear activity (both in the
optical and in the radio) and environment (soft X-rays, group mass, group
hierarchy). Our analysis shows however that these correlations can be
accurately matched by assuming that the disky fraction depends only on galaxy
luminosity or mass. We therefore conclude that neither the level of activity,

N-body simulation, we investigate the origin of the dichotomy among early-type
galaxies. We find that boxy galaxies originate from mergers with a progenitor
mass ratio $n < 2$ and with a combined cold gas mass fraction $F_{\rm cold} <
0.1$. Our model accurately reproduces the observed fraction of boxy systems as
a function of luminosity and halo mass, for both central galaxies and
satellites. After correcting for the stellar mass dependence, the properties of
the last major merger of early-type galaxies are independent of their halo
mass. This provides theoretical support for the conjecture of Pasquali et al
(2007) that the stellar mass of an early-type galaxy is the main parameter that
governs its isophotal shape. We argue that the observed dichotomy of early-type
galaxies has a natural explanation within hierarchical structure formation, and
does not require AGN feedback. Rather, we argue that it owes to the fact that
more massive systems (i) have more massive progenitors, (ii) assemble later,
and (iii) have a larger fraction of early-type progenitors. Each of these three
trends causes the cold gas mass fraction of the progenitors of more massive
early-types to be lower, so that their last major merger was dryer. Finally,
our model predicts that (i) less than 10 percent of all early-type galaxies
form in major mergers that involve two early-type progenitors, (ii) more than
95 percent of all boxy early-type galaxies with $M_* < 2 \times 10^{10} h^{-1}
\Msun$ are satellite galaxies, and (iii) about 70 percent of all low mass
early-types do not form a supermassive black hole binary at their last major
merger. The latter may help to explain why low mass early-types have central
cusps, while their massive counterparts have cores.
","It is therefore necessary to study the origin of this dichotomy of the early universe and the role of dry mergers and AGN feedback in the formation of their morphological features. The results of this study will be useful to our understanding of the diversity of early universes, and to provide a complete picture of the complex interplay between star formation and the formation of early universes. We propose that the formation of early universes will be in keeping with the study of the variety of early universes and will reveal the full nature of the physical processes that lead to their formation. We find that the presence of a central black hole and its interactions with the surrounding gas is significant in the formation of the innermost regions of early universes, particularly the presence of the central black hole, which is occupied by the star-formation, and the central black hole occupying the center, which indicates the presence of a possible coevolutionary process.

sharing isosceles triangles with exchange constants $J$ on two bonds and $J'$
on the third bond. We study the properties of such spin systems, and show that
despite the distortion, the lattice retains a great deal of frustration.
Although sub-extensive, the classical ground state degeneracy remains very
large, growing exponentially with the system perimeter. We consider degeneracy
lifting by thermal and quantum fluctuations. To linear (spin wave) order, the
degeneracy is found to stay intact. Two complementary approaches are therefore
introduced, appropriate to low and high temperatures, which point to the same
ordered pattern. In the low temperature limit, an effective chirality
Hamiltonian is derived from non-linear spin waves which predicts a transition
on increasing $J'/J$, from $\sqrt 3\times \sqrt 3$ type order to a new
ferrimagnetic {\em striped chirality} order with a doubled unit cell. This is
confirmed by a large-N approximation on the O($n$) model on this lattice. While
the saddle point solution produces a line degeneracy, $O(1/n)$ corrections
select the non-trivial wavevector of the striped chirality state. The quantum
limit of spin 1/2 on this lattice is studied via exact small system
diagonalization and compare well with experimental results at intermediate
temperatures. We suggest that the very low temperature spin frozen state seen
in NMR experiments may be related to the disconnected nature of classical
ground states on this lattice, which leads to a prediction for NMR line shapes.
","The first thing we do is to describe the Kagome lattice, which is a two-dimensional, overlapping, and resolving triangle that is in two dimensions, with a special elasticity, and then to compare the results of these two models with experimental data on the resolving of the spins. We are interested in studying the fundamental physics of volborthite and other materials with a similar resolving lattice. This lattice is composed of a distorted Kagome lattice, a magnetized sphere of copper, which is a magnet, which exhibits a number of interesting magnetic properties. Our aim is to study the nature of these magnetic phenomena, and to examine the underlying physics of the material.

Observatory (CGRO) discovered gamma-ray emission from more than 67 blazars
during its 9 yr lifetime. We conducted an exhaustive search of the EGRET
archives and selected all the blazars that were observed multiple times and
were bright enough to enable a spectral analysis using standard power-law
models. The sample consists of 18 flat-spectrum radio quasars(FSRQs), 6
low-frequency peaked BL Lac objects (LBLs) and 2 high-frequency peaked BL Lac
objects (HBLs). We do not detect any clear pattern in the variation of spectral
index with flux. Some of the blazars do not show any statistical evidence for
spectral variability. The spectrum hardens with increasing flux in a few cases.
There is also evidence for a flux-hardness anticorrelation at low fluxes in
five blazars. The well-observed blazars (3C 279, 3C 273, PKS 0528+134, PKS
1622-297 PKS 0208-512) do not show any overall trend in the long-term spectral
dependence on flux, but the sample shows a mixture of hard and soft states. We
observed a previously unreported spectral hysteresis at weekly timescales in
all three FSRQs for which data from flares lasting for ~(3-4) weeks were
available. All three sources show a counterclockwise rotation, despite the
widely different flux profiles. We analyze the observed spectral behavior in
the context of various inverse Compton mechanisms believed to be responsible
for emission in the EGRET energy range. Our analysis uses the EGRET skymaps
that were regenerated to include the changes in performance during the mission.
","In order to establish this fact, we have conducted an investigation of 66 blazars with the aim of establishing the gamma-ray emission in the blazars. To do this, we have used a variety of statistical methods to determine if there is a relationship between the wavelength and the flux, and whether there are any differences between the two measures. We have shown that the correlation between the wavelength and the flux is a strong one, and this is not significant. We have used various statistical methods to investigate whether there is a correlation between the wavelength and the flux, and whether there are any trends in the results after accounting for redshift. We have shown that the wavelength of the blazars is not completely proportional to the flux. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the exact mechanism of the blazars.

recover robust star formation and metallicity histories from galactic spectra.
VESPA uses the full spectral range to construct a galaxy history from synthetic
models. We investigate the use of an adaptative parametrization grid to recover
reliable star formation histories on a galaxy-by-galaxy basis. Our goal is
robustness as opposed to high resolution histories, and the method is designed
to return high time resolution only where the data demand it. In this paper we
detail the method and we present our findings when we apply VESPA to synthetic
and real Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectroscopic data. We show that the
number of parameters that can be recovered from a spectrum depends strongly on
the signal-to-noise, wavelength coverage and presence or absence of a young
population. For a typical SDSS sample of galaxies, we can normally recover
between 2 to 5 stellar populations. We find very good agreement between VESPA
and our previous analysis of the SDSS sample with MOPED.
","I will give an overview of the field. We present the VESPA code, which can be used to extract the formation and evolution of galaxies from the spectra of the observed galaxies. The challenge is to obtain details of the formation and evolution of galaxies from the spectra. We employ a Bayesian approach to determine the formation and evolution of the galaxies and to extract the contributions of different stellar populations at different times. Then we present the results of this study on a sample of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We show that the formation and evolution of galaxies is a complex matter, and that the metallicity of the metals is a weak dependency on the formation rate, as is expected from the theory of astrology. We demonstrate the applicability of VESPA in the analysis of the galaxy formation and the metallicity of the star. In this paper we propose VESPA as a method for inferring the formation and the metallicity of the stars in the spectra of galaxies.

efficiently generate realizations of halo distributions and ionization maps at
high redshifts. Our procedure combines an excursion-set approach with
first-order Lagrangian perturbation theory and operates directly on the linear
density and velocity fields. As such, the achievable dynamic range with our
algorithm surpasses the current practical limit of N-body codes by orders of
magnitude. This is particularly significant in studies of reionization, where
the dynamic range is the principal limiting factor. We test our halo-finding
and HII bubble-finding algorithms independently against N-body simulations with
radiative transfer and obtain excellent agreement. We compute the size
distributions of ionized and neutral regions in our maps. We find even larger
ionized bubbles than do purely analytic models at the same volume-weighted mean
hydrogen neutral fraction. We also generate maps and power spectra of 21-cm
brightness temperature fluctuations, which for the first time include
corrections due to gas bulk velocities. We find that velocities widen the tails
of the temperature distributions and increase small-scale power, though these
effects quickly diminish as reionization progresses. We also include some
preliminary results from a simulation run with the largest dynamic range to
date: a 250 Mpc box that resolves halos with masses M >~ 2.2 x10^8 M_sun. We
show that accurately modeling the late stages of reionization requires such
large scales. The speed and dynamic range provided by our semi-numerical
approach will be extremely useful in the modeling of early structure formation
and reionization.

Seyfert 2 galaxy M51 suggest the presence of a dense circumnuclear rotating
disk, which may be the reservoir for fueling the active nucleus and obscures it
from direct view in the optical. However, our recent interferometric CO(3-2)
observations show a hint of a velocity gradient perpendicular to the rotating
disk, which suggests a more complex structure than previously thought. To image
the putative circumnuclear molecular gas disk at sub-arcsecond resolution to
better understand both the spatial distribution and kinematics of the molecular
gas. We carried out CO(2-1) and CO(1-0) line observations of the nuclear region
of M51 with the new A configuration of the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer,
yielding a spatial resolution lower than 15 pc. The high resolution images show
no clear evidence of a disk, aligned nearly east-west and perpendicular to the
radio jet axis, as suggested by previous observations, but show two separate
features located on the eastern and western sides of the nucleus. The western
feature shows an elongated structure along the jet and a good velocity
correspondence with optical emission lines associated with the jet, suggesting
that this feature is a jet-entrained gas. The eastern feature is elongated
nearly east-west ending around the nucleus. A velocity gradient appears in the
same direction with increasingly blueshifted velocities near the nucleus. This
velocity gradient is in the opposite sense of that previously inferred for the
putative circumnuclear disk. Possible explanations for the observed molecular
gas distribution and kinematics are that a rotating gas disk disturbed by the
jet, gas streaming toward the nucleus, or a ring with another smaller counter-
or Keplarian-rotating gas disk inside.

Our results show that the molecular gas of Seyfert 2 is disturbed by the central jets from the central region, as if the central jets were forming a tight bond with the molecular gas. This link explains the complex interactions of jets with the atmosphere, and it can be interpreted in a complex manner.

  Several of the stars proved to be especially interesting. In BF Eri, we
detect the absorption spectrum of a secondary star of spectral type K3 +- 1

BF Eri has a large proper motion (100 mas/yr), and we have a preliminary
parallax measurement that confirms the large proper motion and yields only an
upper limit for the parallax. BF Eri's space velocity is evidently large, and
it appears to belong to the halo population. In CZ Aql, the emission lines have
strong wings that move with large velocity amplitude, suggesting a
magnetically-channeled accretion flow. The orbital period of V1006 Cyg places
it squarely within the 2- to 3-hour ""gap"" in the distribution of cataclysmic
binary orbital periods.

origin of the nonuniversalities of the prefactors is discussed in the

terms of the entropy. Finally, we discuss the experimental relevance of our

","A new mission of the SIM system, proposed by us, will change the whole field of exoplanet research, and set the stage for the future studies of planetary habitability. The mission of the SIM system is to establish an exoplanet station at a distance of 300 kilometres. This station is based on the technique of Three-Angle Differential Astronomy, which is able to measure the position of objects and the movements of stars. It is based on the TADA method, which is based on the detection of the star transits, combining it with a new and innovative method for detecting the masses and the orbits of the nearby habitable planets. The goal of this project is to discover the diversity of the planets beyond our solar system, and to develop the knowledge of the habitable planets and the habitability of the stars. We have invented a new method for detecting the mass of nearby habitable planets, which is to determine the height and the mass of nearby habitable planets. We are looking for a new type of system, the Sim Planet Quest, that will significantly improve our ability to detect, find the masses, and calculate the orbits of habitable planets in three dimensions.

selected spectroscopically, and an additional 15 are selected by their
photometric redshifts. We derive the IR luminosity function of the cluster and
find strong evolution compared to the similar-mass Coma cluster. The best
fitting Schechter function gives L*_{IR}=11.49 +0.30/-0.29 L_sun with a fixed
faint end slope, about one order of magnitude larger than that in Coma. The
rate of evolution of the IR luminosity from Coma to MS 1054-03 is consistent
with that found in field galaxies, and it suggests that some internal
mechanism, e.g., the consumption of the gas fuel, is responsible for the
general decline of the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) in different
environments. The mass-normalized integrated SFR within 0.5R_200 in MS 1054-03
also shows evolution compared with other rich clusters at lower redshifts, but
the trend is less conclusive if the mass selection effect is considered. A
nonnegligible fraction (13%) of cluster members, are forming stars actively and
the overdensity of IR galaxies is about 20 compared to the field. It is
unlikely that clusters only passively accrete star forming galaxies from the
surrounding fields and have their star formation quenched quickly afterward;
instead, many cluster galaxies still have large amounts of gas, and their star
formation may be enhanced by the interaction with the cluster.

to:(1) errors or failures at random times; (3) costs; and(2) constraints since
sensors and networks operate under scarce resources, such as power, data rate,
or communication. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is usually a main factor in
determining the probability of error (or of communication failure) in a link.
These probabilities are then a proxy for the SNR under which the links operate.
The paper studies the problem of designing the topology, i.e., assigning the
probabilities of reliable communication among sensors (or of link failures) to
maximize the rate of convergence of average consensus, when the link
communication costs are taken into account, and there is an overall
communication budget constraint. To consider this problem, we address a number
of preliminary issues: (1) model the network as a random topology; (2)
establish necessary and sufficient conditions for mean square sense (mss) and
almost sure (a.s.) convergence of average consensus when network links fail;
and, in particular, (3) show that a necessary and sufficient condition for both
mss and a.s. convergence is for the algebraic connectivity of the mean graph
describing the network topology to be strictly positive. With these results, we
formulate topology design, subject to random link failures and to a
communication cost constraint, as a constrained convex optimization problem to
which we apply semidefinite programming techniques. We show by an extensive
numerical study that the optimal design improves significantly the convergence
speed of the consensus algorithm and can achieve the asymptotic performance of
a non-random network at a fraction of the communication cost.
","The study focused on the problem of designing an optimal topology for a network of sensors. It was difficult to find a solution in the form of a simple and decentralized solution. In our work we use random graphs to simulate a network of sensors, and we present an algorithm for calculating the probability of different connectivity levels in the network. Our method is based on the theory of network topology and the notion of network connectivity. In this paper we apply the theory of network topology to the problem of a network of sensors. Our approach is based on the theory of network topology and on the idea of network connections. We develop a mathematical method for the calculation of network topology. The method of network topology is based on a network of links, whose topology is fundamental to the functioning of a network, for which there is an important function to be performed.

November 2005. The BAT monitored it recurrently for a total of 2.7 Ms, and the
XRT and UVOT pointed it on seven occasions for a total of 67 ks, making it one
of the AGNs best monitored by Swift. The automatic optical and infrared
telescope REM has monitored simultaneously the source at all times. In
January-February 2005 PKS0537-441 has been detected at its brightest in optical
and X-rays: more than a factor of 2 brighter in X-rays and about a factor 60
brighter in the optical than observed in December 2004. The July 2005
observation recorded a fainter X-ray state. The simultaneous optical state,
monitored by both Swift UVOT and REM, is high, and in the VRI bands it is
comparable to what was recorded in early January 2005, before the outburst. In
November 2005, the source subsided both in X-rays and optical to a quiescent
state, having decreased by factors of ~4 and ~60 with respect to the
January-February 2005 outburst, respectively. Our monitoring shows an overall
well correlated optical and X-ray decay. On the shorter time scales (days or
hours), there is no obvious correlation between X-ray and optical variations,
but the former tend to be more pronounced, opposite to what is observed on
monthly time scales. The widely different amplitude of the long term
variability in optical and X-rays is very unusual and makes this observation a
unique case study for blazar activity. The spectral energy distributions are
interpreted in terms of the synchrotron and inverse Compton mechanisms within a
jet where the plasma radiates via internal shocks and the dissipation depends
on the distance of the emitting region from the central engine (abridged).

this gap, we consider the problem of jointly optimizing DPC power allocation in
the link layer at each node and multihop/multipath routing in a MIMO-based mesh

non-convex problem. To address this difficulty, we transform the original
problem to an equivalent problem by exploiting the channel duality. For the
transformed problem, we develop an efficient solution procedure that integrates
Lagrangian dual decomposition method, conjugate gradient projection method
based on matrix differential calculus, cutting-plane method, and subgradient
method. In our numerical example, it is shown that we can achieve a network
performance gain of 34.4% by using DPC.

consider variation of the photometric precision by using a quantity defined as
the ratio of the fractional deviation of the planetary perturbation to the
photometric precision. From this investigation, we find consistent result from
previous studies that the probability increases with the increase of the
magnification. The increase rate is boosted at a certain magnification at which
perturbations caused by central caustic begin to occur. We find this boost
occurs at moderate magnifications of $A\lesssim 20$, implying that probability
can be high even for events with moderate magnifications. The probability
increases as the source brightness increases. We find that the probability of
events associated with stars brighter than clump giants is not negligible even
at magnifications as low as $A\sim 5$. In the absence of rare the prime target
of very high-magnification events, we, therefore, recommend to observe events
with brightest source stars and highest magnifications among the alerted
events. Due to the increase of the source size with the increase of the
brightness, however, the probability rapidly drops off beyond a certain
magnification, causing detections of low mass ratio planets ($q\lesssim

protoplanetary discs. They have the potential to efficiently transport angular
momentum by MHD turbulence or via the magnetocentrifugal acceleration of
outflows from the disk surface, and magnetically-driven mixing has implications
for disk chemistry and evolution of the grain population. However, the weak
ionisation of protoplanetary discs means that magnetic fields may not be able
to effectively couple to the matter. I present calculations of the ionisation
equilibrium and magnetic diffusivity as a function of height from the disk
midplane at radii of 1 and 5 AU. Dust grains tend to suppress magnetic coupling
by soaking up electrons and ions from the gas phase and reducing the
conductivity of the gas by many orders of magnitude. However, once grains have
grown to a few microns in size their effect starts to wane and magnetic fields
can begin to couple to the gas even at the disk midplane. Because ions are
generally decoupled from the magnetic field by neutral collisions while
electrons are not, the Hall effect tends to dominate the diffusion of the
magnetic field when it is able to partially couple to the gas.
  For a standard population of 0.1 micron grains the active surface layers have
a combined column of about 2 g/cm^2 at 1 AU; by the time grains have aggregated
to 3 microns the active surface density is 80 g/cm^2. In the absence of grains,
x-rays maintain magnetic coupling to 10% of the disk material at 1 AU (150
g/cm^2). At 5 AU the entire disk thickness becomes active once grains have

shows significant variability from the best fit constant spin-down rate of
$\dot P = 7.5112(6) \times 10^{-13}$ s s$^{-1}$, suggesting strong timing noise
and/or glitch activity. The X-ray emission is highly pulsed ($71\pm5%$

duty cycle) which is nearly twice the radio width. The spectrum of the pulsed
emission is well fitted with an absorbed power law of photon index $\Gamma =

The main method we used was to model the pulses, calculate the pulse arrival times, and calculate the timing properties of the pulsar by means of a set of statistical methods. The X-ray timing of PSR J1930 was stable and was of a rotational period of 91.00.7101111 s/s. We found that the pulsar emitted a lot of angular energy and a great deal of angular momentum, corresponding to the rotational motion of the pulsar.

systems, intercepts a z=0.68 spiral galaxy, which splits its image into two
main components A and B, separated by ca. 0.3'', and gives rise to molecular
absorption. Although the main absorption component has been shown to arise in
front of image A, it is not established whether some absorption from other
velocity components is also occuring in front of image B. To tackle this
question, we have observed the HCO+(2-1) absorption line during the
commissioning phase of the new very extended configuration of the Plateau de
Bure Interferometer, in order to trace the position of the absorption as a
function of frequency. Visibility fitting of the self-calibrated data allowed
us to achieve position accuracy between ~12 and 80 mas per velocity component.
Our results clearly demonstrate that all the different velocity components of
the HCO+(2-1) absorption arise in front of the south-west image A of the
quasar. We estimate a flux ratio fA/fB = 4.2 (-1.0;+1.8 at 106 GHz.

the spectrum of cosmic rays at $\sim 10^{19}$ eV. A scenario interprets the
ankle as the transition from Galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays ({\it
ankle-transition scenario}), while the other is that the dip caused by pair
production on the cosmic microwave background radiation ({\it proton-dip
scenario}). In this paper, we consider whether cosmogenic neutrinos can be a
clue to judge which scenario is favored. We calculated the fluxes of cosmogenic
neutrinos following these scenarios with plausible physical parameter sets, and
found several important features as follows. First of all, the neutrino flux at
$\sim 10^{20}$ eV becomes much higher in the ankle-transition scenario as long
as the maximum energy of the cosmic rays at sources is sufficiently high. On
the other hand, the neutrino spectrum has a characteristic peak at $\sim
10^{16}$ eV in the proton-dip scenario on the condition that extragalactic
protons significantly contribute to the observed cosmic rays down to $10^{17}$
eV. Thus, we conclude cosmogenic neutrinos should give us a clue to judge which
scenario is favored, unless these features are masked by the neutrino
background coming from possible, powerful neutrino sources such as AGNs and
GRBs. We also found an interesting feature that the neutrino flux at $\sim
10^{18}$ eV depends only on the cosmological evolution of the cosmic ray
sources. That means cosmogenic neutrinos with the energy bring us information
on the cosmological evolution of the sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays.
Finally, we compare the fluxes of cosmogenic neutrinos with the expected
sensitivity curves of several neutrino detectors, and conclude the detection of
cosmogenic neutrinos in the near future is promising.

Cosmic rays are high-energy particles, and the sources are supernovae, pulsars, gamma-rays, and active galactic nuclei.

the daemon approach is analyzed considering the positive model independent
result of the DAMA/NaI experiment. We explain the maximum in DAMA signals
observed in the May-June period to be associated with the formation behind the
Sun of a trail of daemons that the Sun captures into elongated orbits as it
moves to the apex. The range of significant 2-6-keV DAMA signals fits well the
iodine nuclei elastically knocked out of the NaI(Tl) scintillator by particles
falling on the Earth with V=30-50 km/s from strongly elongated heliocentric
orbits. The half-year periodicity of the slower daemons observed in SPb
originates from the transfer of particles that are deflected through ~90 deg
into near-Earth orbits each time the particles cross the outer reaches of the
Sun which had captured them. Their multi-loop (cross-like) trajectories
traverse many times the Earth's orbit in March and September, which increases
the probability for the particles to enter near-Earth orbits during this time.

three families of Higgses and vector-like colour triplets. Our approach relies
on the Fayet-Iliopoulos breaking, and this is also a crucial ingredient,
together with having three Higgs families, to obtain in these models an
interesting pattern of fermion masses and mixing angles at the renormalizable
lebel. Namely, after the gauge breaking some physical particles appear combined
with other states, and the Yukawa couplings are modified in a well controlled
way. On the other hand, dangerous flavour-changing neutral currents may appear
when fermions of a given charge receive their mass through couplings with
several Higgs doublets. We will address this potential problem, finding that
viable scenarios can be obtained for a reasonable light Higgs spectrum.

spectral line data from the Submillimeter Array, VLA 3.6cm continuum and 1.3cm
water maser data, and multicolor IRAC images from the Spitzer Space Telescope.
The cometary morphology of the previously-known UCHII region G192.584-0.041 is
clearly revealed in our sensitive, multi-configuration 3.6cm images. The 1.3mm
continuum emission has been resolved into three compact cores, all of which are
dominated by dust emission and have radii < 7000AU. The mass estimates for
these cores range from 6 to 35 Msun. The centroid of the brightest dust core
(SMA1) is offset by 1.1'' (2800 AU) from the peak of the cometary UCHII region
and exhibits the strongest HC3N, CN, and DCN line emission in the region. SMA1
also exhibits compact CH3OH, SiO, and H2CO emission and likely contains a young
hot core. We find spatial and kinematic evidence that SMA1 may contain further
multiplicity, with one of the components coincident with a newly-detected H2O
maser. There are no mid-infrared point source counterparts to any of the dust
cores, further suggesting an early evolutionary phase for these objects. The
dominant mid-infrared emission is a diffuse, broadband component that traces
the surface of the cometary UCHII region but is obscured by foreground material
on its southern edge. An additional 4.5 micron linear feature emanating to the
northeast of SMA1 is aligned with a cluster of methanol masers and likely
traces a outflow from a protostar within SMA1. Our observations provide direct
evidence that S255N is forming a cluster of intermediate to high-mass stars.

YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ is dominated by a sharp resonance peak at the frequency 40
meV in the superconducting state. Below and above the resonance frequency, the
incommensurate (IC) peaks develop and the intensity of the peaks decreases
dramatically. In the normal state, the resonant excitation does not occur and
the IC peaks are merged into commensurate ones. The spin excitation of
La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ is significantly different from that of Y-based ones,
namely, the resonance peak does not exist due to the decreasing of the
superconducting gap and the presence of the possible spin-stripe order. The
spectra are only enhanced at the expected resonance frequency (about 18 meV)
while it is still incommensurate. On the other hand, another frequency scale at
the frequency 55 meV is also revealed, namely the spectra are commensurate and
local maximum at this frequency. We elaborate all the results based on the
Fermi surface topology and the d-wave superconductivity, and suggest that the
spin-stripe order be also important in determining the spin excitation of

The basic idea of the study is that the dielectric constant of the surrounding material is different from that of the nanotube. We are examining the effect of the dielectric constant of the surrounding material on the conductive properties of SWCNTs. Our goal is to study the conductive properties of SWCNTs and make a generalized study of the electronic properties of them. This paper is based on a dielectric continuum theory which is used to investigate the effect of the surrounding material on the electrical properties of SWCNTs. We find that the binding energy of the conductive material increases with the dielectric constant of the surrounding material and causes red shifts in the optical absorption spectrum of SWCNTs.

partial monitoring. Given a weighted directed acyclic graph whose edge weights
can change in an arbitrary (adversarial) way, a decision maker has to choose in
each round of a game a path between two distinguished vertices such that the
loss of the chosen path (defined as the sum of the weights of its composing
edges) be as small as possible. In a setting generalizing the multi-armed
bandit problem, after choosing a path, the decision maker learns only the
weights of those edges that belong to the chosen path. For this problem, an
algorithm is given whose average cumulative loss in n rounds exceeds that of
the best path, matched off-line to the entire sequence of the edge weights, by
a quantity that is proportional to 1/\sqrt{n} and depends only polynomially on
the number of edges of the graph. The algorithm can be implemented with linear
complexity in the number of rounds n and in the number of edges. An extension
to the so-called label efficient setting is also given, in which the decision
maker is informed about the weights of the edges corresponding to the chosen
path at a total of m << n time instances. Another extension is shown where the
decision maker competes against a time-varying path, a generalization of the
problem of tracking the best expert. A version of the multi-armed bandit
setting for shortest path is also discussed where the decision maker learns
only the total weight of the chosen path but not the weights of the individual
edges on the path. Applications to routing in packet switched networks along
with simulation results are also presented.

This is an important work in the field of online optimization under partial feedback. We investigate the effectiveness and accuracy of our method in real-world and synthetic networks, and we show that our method is superior to the existing methods in accuracy and accuracy. In addition, our method incorporates a dynamic programming framework, and it can be easily integrated into the network, allowing to get rid of the feedback of previous rounds. In our approach, we develop a robust and robust algorithm to determine the optimal path, given the incomplete information about the network, and provide an intermediate solution, based on the partial feedback of the first rounds. We study the effectiveness and accuracy of our method with both synthetic and real networks, and demonstrate that it is superior to existing methods in accuracy and efficiency.

acting between two dielectrics, dielectric and metal, and between metal and
semiconductor. The detailed derivation for the low-temperature behavior of the
Casimir free energy, pressure and entropy in the configuration of two real
dielectric plates is presented. For dielectrics with finite static dielectric
permittivity it is shown that the Nernst heat theorem is satisfied. Hence, the
Lifshitz theory of the van der Waals and Casimir forces is demonstrated to be
consistent with thermodynamics. The nonzero dc conductivity of dielectric
plates is proved to lead to a violation of the Nernst heat theorem and, thus,
is not related to the phenomenon of dispersion forces. The low-temperature
asymptotics of the Casimir free energy, pressure and entropy are derived also
in the configuration of one metal and one dielectric plate. The results are
shown to be consistent with thermodynamics if the dielectric plate possesses a
finite static dielectric permittivity. If the dc conductivity of a dielectric
plate is taken into account this results in the violation of the Nernst heat
theorem. We discuss both the experimental and theoretical results related to
the Casimir interaction between metal and semiconductor with different charge
carrier density. Discussions in the literature on the possible influence of
spatial dispersion on the thermal Casimir force are analyzed. In conclusion,
the conventional Lifshitz theory taking into account only the frequency
dispersion remains the reliable foundation for the interpretation of all
present experiments.

In the case of the larger plates, the thermal calamity dominates, and the result depends on the temperature and dielectric properties of the materials. The thermal calamity is a consequence of these quantum fluctuations, which cause an attractive force between parallel plates, which is suppressed by the absence of virtual electrons.

field fluid model, the results deduced from this model agree very well with the
observations. The observed cosmological redshift of light depends on both the
speed of the emitter and the distance between the emitter and the observer. If
the emitter moves away from us, a redshift is observed. If the emitter moves
towards us, whether a redshift, a blueshift or no shift is observed will depend
on the speed vs. the distance. If the speed is in the range of
c(exp[-beta*D]-1) < v < 0, a redshift is observed; if the speed equals
c(exp[-beta*D]-1), no shift is observed; if the speed v less than
c(exp[-beta*D]-1), a blueshift is observed. A redshift will be always observed
in all directions for any celestial objects as long as their distance from us
is large enough. Therefore, many more redshifts than blueshifts should be
observed for galaxies and supernovae, etc in the sky. This conclusion agrees
with current observations. The estimated value of the redshift constant beta of
the dark matter field fluid is in the range of 10^(-3) ~ 10^(-5)/Mpc. A large
redshift value from a distant celestial object may not necessarily indicate
that it has a large receding speed. Based on the redshift effect of dark matter
field fluid, it is concluded that at least in time average all photons have the
same geometry (size and shape) in all inertial reference frames and do not have
length contraction effect.

elements of scalar densities, e.g. $<K\bar K|\bar ss|0>$, which can be
constrained from the decay $\bar B^0\to K_SK_SK_S$ or $B^-\to K^-K_SK_S$. The
intermediate vector meson contributions to 3-body decays are identified through
the vector current, while the scalar meson resonances are mainly associated
with the scalar density. Their effects are described in terms of the

by the nonresonant background. The predicted branching ratios of
$K^+K^-K_{S(L)}$, $K^+K^-K^-$ and $K^-K_SK_S$ modes are consistent with the
data within errors. (ii) Although the penguin-dominated $B^0\to K^+K^-K_{S}$
decay is subject to a potentially significant tree pollution, its effective
$\sin 2\beta$ is very similar to that of the $K_SK_SK_S$ mode. However, direct
CP asymmetry of the former, being of order -4%, is more prominent than the

discussed and interesting constraints derived. For example, it is predicted
that quantum mechanical brain states should get frozen if monitored at
sufficiently small space-time intervals - a neuro-biological version of the so
called quantum zeno effect, which has been verified in domain of micro-physics.

for the first time, the distribution of the decay index of the GRB tail

the time interval of a fitting region are proposed. These definitions for
fitting the light curve lead us an unique definition of the decay index, which
is useful to investigate the structure of the GRB jet. We find that if the GRB
jet has a core-envelope structure, the predicted distribution of the decay
index of the tail has a wide scatter and has multiple peaks, which cannot be
seen for the case of the uniform and the Gaussian jet. Therefore, the decay
index distribution tells us the information on the jet structure. Especially,

the s_i^xy component. As another purely quantum effect, (i) in the
antiferromagnet, the value of the specific heat peak is insensitive to
anisotropy and the temperature of the specific heat peak decreases from the

cases of standard mixed formulations of symmetric problems with large jumps in
coefficients. We prove that they are well-posed in a standard norm despite the
degeneracy. By wellposedness we mean a stable dependence of the solution on the
right-hand side. A known approach of splitting the saddle point problem into
separate equations for the primary unknown and for the Lagrange multiplier is
used. We revisit the traditional Ladygenskaya--Babu\v{s}ka--Brezzi (LBB) or
inf--sup condition as well as the standard coercivity condition, and analyze
how they are affected by the degeneracy of the corresponding bilinear forms. We
suggest and discuss generalized conditions that cover the degenerate case. The
LBB or inf--sup condition is necessary and sufficient for wellposedness of the
problem with respect to the Lagrange multiplier under some assumptions. The
generalized coercivity condition is necessary and sufficient for wellposedness
of the problem with respect to the primary unknown under some other

positiveness of the minimum gap of relevant subspaces, and propose several
equivalent expressions for the minimum gap. Our results provide a foundation

very low detection probability. Planets of low metallicity stars typically do
not reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system
properties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is
considered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,
respectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems
at high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,
where M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is
only at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it
is still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular
clusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at
orbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on
the role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in
globular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch
stars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in
forming low mass white dwarfs.
","We analyzed the population of stars in the central constellation and their star masses in terms of their metallicity, to find out how many planets are expected to be found in the dense population. We find that globular clusters are not the most favorable places for the formation of planets, and that planetary formation in them is rare. In this research we are trying to determine whether planetary formation is common or rare in globular clusters, and whether it is likely to be uncommon. In this study we investigated the number of planets in the dense neighborhood of globular clusters. In globular clusters, the metallicity is low, and the planets are less likely to be present. However, we also found that in some of the larger stars, because they are of a high mass, they are not able to be seen very often. In general, we are interested in the evolution of planetary systems.

neutrino Majorana masses in certain classes of semi-realistic string
compactifications. In this paper we make a systematic search for supersymmetric
MSSM-like Type II Gepner orientifold constructions admitting boundary states
associated with instantons giving rise to neutrino Majorana masses and other L-
and/or B-violating operators. We analyze the zero mode structure of D-brane
instantons on general type II orientifold compactifications, and show that only
instantons with O(1) symmetry can have just the two zero modes required to
contribute to the 4d superpotential. We however discuss how the addition of
fluxes and/or possible non-perturbative extensions of the orientifold
compactifications would allow also instantons with $Sp(2)$ and U(1) symmetries
to generate such superpotentials. In the context of Gepner orientifolds with
MSSM-like spectra, we find no models with O(1) instantons with just the
required zero modes to generate a neutrino mass superpotential. On the other
hand we find a number of models in one particular orientifold of the Gepner
model $(2,4,22,22)$ with $Sp(2)$ instantons with a few extra uncharged
non-chiral zero modes which could be easily lifted by the mentioned effects. A
few more orientifold examples are also found under less stringent constraints
on the zero modes. This class of $Sp(2)$ instantons have the interesting
property that R-parity conservation is automatic and the flavour structure of
the neutrino Majorana mass matrices has a simple factorized form.

analysed from a very general viewpoint. From this perspective the
renormalization prescriptions not only imply the renormalization of the
couplings of the theory in the bulk but also the appearance of a flow in the
space of boundary conditions. For regular boundaries this flow has a large
variety of fixed points and no cyclic orbit. The family of fixed points
includes Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions. In one-dimensional field
theories pseudoperiodic and quasiperiodic boundary conditions are also RG fixed
points. Under these conditions massless bosonic free field theories are
conformally invariant. Among all fixed points only Neumann boundary conditions
are infrared stable fixed points. All other conformal invariant boundary
conditions become unstable under some relevant perturbations. In finite volumes
we analyse the dependence of the vacuum energy along the trajectories of the
renormalization group flow providing an interesting framework for dark energy
evolution. On the contrary, the renormalization group flow on the boundary does
not affect the leading behaviour of the entanglement entropy of the vacuum in
one-dimensional conformally invariant bosonic theories.

Our calculation shows that the boundary imposes a change in the renormalization process and the vacuum energy at the boundary. The effect of the boundary increases the pressure of the vacuum near the boundary, and this increase is due to the modification of the normalization process, which in turn changes the vacuum energy.

More significantly, inclusion of other harmonics in our matched filters would
mean that more massive systems that were previously thought to be {\it not}

that we should be able to significantly increase the mass reach of LISA and
observe the more commonly occurring supermassive black holes of masses $\sim
10^8M_\odot.$ More specifically, with the inclusion of all known harmonics LISA
will be able to observe even supermassive black hole coalescences with total
mass $\sim 10^8 M_\odot (10^9M_\odot)$ (and mass-ratio 0.1) for a low frequency
cut-off of $10^{-4}{\rm Hz}$ $(10^{-5}{\rm Hz})$ with an SNR up to $\sim 60$

viewpoint since observational evidence for the existence of black holes in this

holes will be inaccessible to LISA if one uses as detection templates only the

the Laplace expansion of the Coulomb potential which possesses a characteristic
two-range form. Guseinov [Chem. Phys. {\bf 309}, 209 - 213 (2005)] derived
one-range addition theorems for the Coulomb potential via the limit $\beta \to
0$ in previously derived one-range addition theorems for the Yukawa potential
$\exp \bigl(-\beta | \bm{r}-\bm{r}'| \bigr) /| \bm{r}-\bm{r}'|$. At first
sight, this looks like a remarkable achievement, but from a mathematical point
of view, Guseinov's work is at best questionable and in some cases
fundamentally flawed. One-range addition theorems are expansions in terms of
functions that are complete and orthonormal in a given Hilbert space, but
Guseinov replaced the complete and orthonormal functions by nonorthogonal
Slater-type functions and rearranged the resulting expansions. This is a
dangerous operation whose validity must be checked. It is shown that the
one-center limit $\bm{r}' = \bm{0}$ of Guseinov's rearranged Yukawa addition
theorems as well as of several other addition theorems does not exist.
Moreover, the Coulomb potential does not belong to any of the Hilbert spaces
implicitly used by Guseinov. Accordingly, one-range addition theorems for the
Coulomb potential diverge in the mean. Instead, these one-range addition
theorems have to interpreted as expansions of generalized functions in the
sense of Schwartz that converge weakly in suitable functionals.

relative to the Ha emission from the preshock gas. The observation supports the
existence of a thin precursor where gas is heated and accelerated ahead of the

","Then we discussed a case study of a Balmer-dominated explosion in Tycho's reconstructed remnant, involving the use of the Subaru Telescope. Our investigation was directed to the Balmer-dominated explosion, in which the H-alpha line was dominant, which characterized the presence of a shock wave. We observed a rapid rise of the gas velocity in the H-alpha line, which corresponded to the recurrent recurrent explosion in the reconstructed remnant. The results of our investigation were useful to the public in general, in the course of which the study of supernovae, its formation and evolution, was enriched. The recurrent explosion, with its corresponding H-alpha line, is of a size that is more than 10 ml and, in terms of the temperature, is about 10,000 Kelvin. The Subaru Telescope's high-resolution spectrograph has a wealth of information on the physics of the explosion.

been selected with different luminosity to investigate the dependence of the

$qq$ forces) to the analytical structure of the $qqq$ wave function is worked
out in the high momentum regime of QCD where the confining interaction may be

this study is that the spin-rich $qqq$ force is generated by a $ggg$ vertex (a
genuine part of the QCD Lagrangian) wherein the 3 radiating gluon lines end on
as many quark lines, giving rise to a (Mercedes-Benz type) $Y$-shaped diagram.
The dynamics is that of a Salpeter-like equation (3D support for the kernel)
formulated covariantly on the light front, a la Markov-Yukawa Transversality
Principle (MYTP) which warrants a 2-way interconnection between the 3D and 4D
Bethe-Salpeter (BSE) forms for 2 as well as 3 fermion quarks. With these
ingredients, the differential equation for the 3D wave function $\phi$ receives
well-defined contributions from the $qq$ and $qqq$ forces. In particular a
$negative$ eigenvalue of the spin operator $i \sigma_1.\sigma_2\times \sigma_3$
which is an integral part of the $qqq$ force, causes a characteristic
singularity in the differential equation, signalling the dynamical effect of a
spin-rich $qqq$ force not yet considered in the literature. The potentially
crucial role of this interesting effect vis-a-vis the so-called `spin anomaly'
of the proton, is a subject of considerable physical interest.

We take advantage of the Dyson–Schwinger equation to derive the non-perturbative QCD processes. Using this method, we consider the non-perturbative QCD. We study the astonishment of the QCD waves in the light front of the QCD, which is above the limit of momentum. Our main conclusions reveal that the QQQ force plays a significant role in the astonishment of QCD waves, and that the QCD waves are invariably non-trivial beyond the first order contribution.

these sources were fitted using two spectral models (an absorbed power-law and
a disk blackbody) to ascertain the dependence of estimated parameters on the
spectral model used. It was found that the cumulative luminosity function
depends on the choice of the spectral model, especially for luminosities $>
10^{40}$ ergs/s. In accordance with previous results, a large number ($\sim
80$) of the sources have luminosities $> 10^{39}$ ergs/s (Ultra-Luminous X-ray
sources) with indistinguishable average spectral parameters (inner disk
temperature $\sim 1$ keV and/or photon index $\Gamma \sim 2$) with those of the
lower luminosities ones. After considering foreground stars and known
background AGN,we identify four sources whose minimum luminosity exceed
$10^{40}$ ergs/s, and call them Extremely Luminous X-ray sources (ELX). The
spectra of these sources are in general better represented by the disk black
body model than the power-law one. These ELX can be grouped into two distinct
spectral classes. Two of them have an inner disk temperature of $< 0.5$ keV and
hence are called ``supersoft'' ELX, while the other two have temperatures
$\gtrsim 1.3$ keV and are called ``hard'' ELX. The estimated inner disk
temperatures of the supersoft ELX are compatible with the hypothesis that they
harbor intermediate size black holes, which are accreting at $\sim 0.5$ times

Inverse Comptonization, which in contrast to standard black holes systems, is
probably saturated.

Our study is the first to provide a quantitative study of the influence of spectral models on the luminosity of ULXs. The light from ULXs is of an X-ray wavelength which exceeds the Eddington limit for a neutron star. The spectral models of the ULXs, which are extremely light-resistant, are under a great deal of scrutiny. The estimation of the luminosity of a ULX, as a result of the choice of spectral models, is therefore very important. In this paper, we study the spectral dependence of ULXs on spectral models. The thermal models tend to overestimate the luminosity, while the thermal models tend to overestimate it. We find that the compton model reveals better sensitivity to the data and produces a better luminosity estimate.

of lattice points, chiral symmetry is broken spontaneously, and our results are
in agreement with expressions based on a chiral Lagrangian. In this limit, the
eigenvalues of the Dirac operator are correlated according to random matrix

evolutionary tracks. We interpret this as evidence for efficient
rotationally-enhanced mixing, leading to the surfacing of primary helium and to
an increase of the stellar luminosity. This result is consistent with findings
for SMC stars by Mokiem et al. For bright giants and supergiants no such
mass-discrepancy is found, implying that these stars follow tracks of modestly
(or non-)rotating objects. Stellar mass-loss properties were found to be
intermediate to those found in massive stars in the Galaxy and the SMC, and

In our experiments we have examined the kinematics and the ionization state of the nebulae. We have shown that the ionization is driven by active galactic nuclei and/or star formation. Nevertheless, the mechanism of ionization is still unknown. The results of our investigation show that the nebulae are composed of two different types: a nebula with a size of tens of kiloparsecs long, a dense ionization, a strong and fast ionization, a nebulae whose size extends to ten thousand kiloparsecs and which show a complex ionization, thereby a remarkable area of study.

ubiquitous trait seems to increase motivation and persistence, and is probably
evolutionarily adaptive. But how good really is our ability to control? How
successful is our track record in these areas? There is little understanding of
when and under what circumstances we may over-estimate or even lose our ability
to control and optimize outcomes, especially when they are the result of
aggregations of individual optimization processes. Here, we demonstrate
analytically using the theory of Markov Chains and by numerical simulations in
two classes of games, the Minority game and the Parrondo Games, that agents who
optimize their strategy based on past information actually perform worse than
non-optimizing agents. In other words, low-entropy (more informative)
strategies under-perform high-entropy (or random) strategies. This provides a
precise definition of the ""illusion of control"" in set-ups a priori defined to
emphasize the importance of optimization.
","The main idea of the experiment was to determine how much control they had over the outcome, and to see how much control they had over the outcome. This finding made us consider how influential beliefs can be in decision-making. In short, the concept of “control” has been widely studied and is very well known in the field. To investigate this phenomenon, we developed the concept of “control” in the games Minority and Parrondo, two games well known in the field. This research was based on the fact that people tend to overestimate their power to influence the outcome of their decisions, especially in situations where chance is involved. We took the idea of “control” in both the games Minority and Parrondo, which have been well studied in the field. The implication of this research was that we wanted to learn the complex relations between randomness and control and decision-making, which gave us some important insights.

monitored for a period of five years (1997-2003), using a small array of
scintillation detectors in Tehran, Iran. The data have been analyzed to take in
to account of the dependence of source counts on zenith angle. Because of
varying thickness of the overlaying atmosphere, the shower count rate is
extremely dependent on zenith angle. During a calendar year different sources
come in the field of view of the array at varying zenith angles and have
different effective observation time equivalent to zenith in a day. High energy
gamma-ray sources from the EGRET third catalogue where observed and the data
were analyzed using an excess method. Upper limits were obtained for 10 EGRET
sources. Then we investigated the EAS event rates for these 10 sources and
obtained a flux for each of them using parameters of our experiment results and

applied magnetic field, has been shown to exhibit a nonequilibrium,
second-order dynamic phase transition (DPT), whose order parameter Q is the
period-averaged magnetization. It has been established that this DPT falls in
the same universality class as the equilibrium phase transition in the
two-dimensional Ising model in zero applied field. Here we study for the first
time the scaling of the dynamic order parameter with respect to a nonzero,
period-averaged, magnetic `bias' field, H_b, for a DPT produced by a
square-wave applied field. We find evidence that the scaling exponent,
\delta_d, of H_b at the critical period of the DPT is equal to the exponent for
the critical isotherm, \delta_e, in the equilibrium Ising model. This implies
that H_b is a significant component of the field conjugate to Q. A finite-size
scaling analysis of the dynamic order parameter above the critical period
provides further support for this result. We also demonstrate numerically that,
for a range of periods and values of H_b in the critical region, a
fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR), with an effective temperature
T_{eff}(T, P, H_0) depending on the period, and possibly the temperature and
field amplitude, holds for the variables Q and H_b. This FDR justifies the use
of the scaled variance of Q as a proxy for the nonequilibrium susceptibility,
\partial<Q> / \partial H_b, in the critical region.
","We use the method of the conjugate field to solve the equation of motion of the order and the relationship between the fluctuations of the order, and to calculate the critical exponents. Our goal is to study the dynamic transition of the Ising model, which is a paradigmatic model of statistical physics. The key idea of our work is to investigate the behavior of the order exponent in the Ising model, and to understand the behavior of other systems of the same sort. The key problem is to describe the behavior of the order exponent in the Ising model. We study the elasticity of the elasticity of the order exponent, and find out the critical exponent from the scaling of the order exponent. In this study, we study the behavior of the order exponent, and we find that the order exponent is governed by a non-linear diffusion equation, and the wave solutions are stationary and moving. The critical exponents are obtained by analyzing the order exponents.

by the presence of highly disturbed local HI and a preponderance of

examined and by comparing with a second area on the sky it is demonstrated that
the associations do not appear to be the result of chance coincidence. Close
examination of several of the associations reveals important new properties of
diffuse interstellar neutral hydrogen structure. In the case of high-velocity

X-ray emission and H-alpha emission have been reported for this feature. It is
suggested that the small angular-scale, high frequency continuum emission
observed by WMAP may be produced at the surfaces of HI features interacting one
another, or at the interface between moving HI structures and regions of

that dust grains play a role in producing the emission. However, the primary

of the H I Ly-$\alpha$ line and the O VI and Mg X doublets formed in solar
coronal holes is investigated. We employ an analytical 2-D model of the large
scale coronal magnetic field that provides a good representation of the corona
at the minimum of solar activity. We use the mass-flux conservation equation to
determine the outflow speed of the solar wind at any location in the solar
corona and take into account the integration along the line of sight (LOS). The
main assumption we make is that no anisotropy in the kinetic temperature of the
coronal species is considered. We find that at distances greater than 1 Rsun
from the solar surface the widths of the emitted lines of O VI and Mg X are
sensitive to the details of the adopted electron density stratification.
However, Ly-$\alpha$, which is a pure radiative line, is hardly affected. The
calculated total intensities of Ly-$\alpha$ and the O VI doublet depend to a
lesser degree on the density stratification and are comparable to the observed
ones for most of the considered density models. The widths of the observed
profiles of Ly-$\alpha$ and Mg X are well reproduced by most of the considered
electron density stratifications, while for the O VI doublet only few
stratifications give satisfying results. The densities deduced from SOHO data
result in O VI profiles whose widths and intensity ratio are relatively close
to the values observed by UVCS although only isotropic velocity distributions
are employed. These density profiles also reproduce the other considered
observables with good accuracy. Thus the need for a strong anisotropy of the
velocity distribution (i.e. a temperature anisotropy) is not so clear cut as

3.35129827(65), 3.58098501(34), and 3.56937674(26) h, respectively. HS
0805+3822 shows grazing eclipses and has a likely orbital period of 3.2169(2)
h. Time-resolved optical spectroscopy of the new CVs (with the exception of HS
0805+3822) is also presented. Radial velocity studies provided an orbital
period of 3.55 h for HS 1813+6122, which allowed us to identify the observed
photometric signal at 3.39 h as a negative superhump wave. The spectroscopic
behaviour clearly identifies these new CVs as new SW Sextantis stars. These new
additions increase the number of known SW Sex stars to 35. Almost 40 per cent
of the total SW Sex population do not show eclipses, invalidating the
requirement of eclipses as a defining characteristic of the class and the
models based on a high orbital inclination geometry alone. On the other hand,
the predominance of orbital periods in the narrow 3-4.5 h range is becoming
more pronounced. In fact, almost half the CVs which populate the 3-4.5 h period
interval are definite members of the class. These statistics are confirmed by
our results from the Hamburg Quasar Survey CVs. Remarkably, 54 per cent of the
Hamburg nova-like variables have been identified as SW Sex stars with orbital
periods in the 3-4.5 h range. The observation of this pile-up of systems close
to the upper boundary of the period gap is difficult to reconcile with the
standard theory of CV evolution, as the SW Sex stars are believed to have the
highest mass transfer rates among CVs. Finally, we review the full range of
common properties that the SW Sex stars exhibit.

to a new feature of dynamical difference equations which may not have constant
step-size, posing new mathematical problems. It is discussed how such models
can be evaluated and what lattice refinements imply for semiclassical behavior.
Two detailed examples illustrate that stability conditions can put strong
constraints on suitable refinement models, even in the absence of a fundamental
Hamiltonian which defines changes of the underlying lattice. Thus, a large
class of consistency tests of loop quantum gravity becomes available. In this
context, it will also be seen that quantum corrections due to inverse powers of
metric components in a constraint are much larger than they appeared recently
in more special treatments of isotropic, free scalar models where they were
artificially suppressed.

the stability of the smectic phase may be greatly enhanced, and that this
effect can be rationalised in terms of depletion forces. In the present paper
we first study the effect of orientational order on depletion forces in this
particular binary system, comparing our results with those obtained adopting
the usual approximation of considering the rods parallel and their orientations
frozen. We consider mixtures with rods of different aspect ratios and spheres
of different diameters, and we treat them within Onsager theory. Our results
indicate that depletion effects, and consequently smectic stability, decrease
significantly as a result of orientational disorder in the smectic phase when
compared with corresponding data based on the frozen--orientation
approximation. These results are discussed in terms of the $\tau$ parameter,
which has been proposed as a convenient measure of depletion strength. We
present closed expressions for $\tau$, and show that it is intimately connected
with the depletion potential. We then analyse the effect of particle geometry
by comparing results pertaining to systems of parallel rods of different shapes
(spherocylinders, cylinders and parallelepipeds). We finally provide results
based on the Zwanzig approximation of a Fundamental--Measure
density--functional theory applied to mixtures of parallelepipeds and cubes of
different sizes. In this case, we show that the $\tau$ parameter exhibits a
linear asymptotic behaviour in the limit of large values of the hard--rod
aspect ratio, in conformity with Onsager theory, as well as in the limit of
large values of the ratio of rod breadth to cube side length, $d$, in contrast
to Onsager approximation, which predicts $\tau\sim d^3$.
","The work we are doing is to understand the depletion of smectic phases in a mixture of hard rod and hard sphere, and to find out the effect of these depletion on the structure and properties of the smectic phases. The purpose of this work is to understand the depletion of smectic phases in the mixture of hard rod and hard sphere, and to clarify the role of depletion in the structure and properties of smectic phases. In a mixture of hard rod and hard sphere, the smectic phases are influenced by the competition between the axes and the spheres, and this competition leads to the reduction of the effective fraction of the spheres, which in turn affects the properties of the smectic phases. This research is based on the fact that the study of smectic phases has important consequences not only for the sciences but for a wide range of practical applications, such as in the field of materials, in liquid crystal displays, in medicine.

the rare B-decays b -> s gamma and B_u -> tau nu and the experimental limit on
the B_s -> mu+ mu- branching ratio. We show that these constraints are severe
for large values of the trilinear soft breaking parameter A_t, rendering the
non-standard Higgs searches at hadron colliders less promising. On the contrary
these bounds are relaxed for small values of A_t and large values of the
Higgsino mass parameter mu, enhancing the prospects for the direct detection of
non-standard Higgs bosons at both colliders. We also consider the available
ATLAS and CMS projected sensitivities in the standard model Higgs search
channels, and we discuss the LHC's ability in probing the whole MSSM parameter
space. In addition we also consider the expected Tevatron collider
sensitivities in the standard model Higgs h -> b bbar channel to show that it
may be able to find 3 sigma evidence in the B-physics allowed regions for small

phase contains black hole-like objects. These so-called ``plasma puddles'' are
meta-stable lumps of hot plasma lying in locally un-Higgsed regions of space.
They decay via O(1/N) thermal radiation and, perhaps surprisingly, absorb all
incident matter. We show that an incident particle of energy E striking the
plasma puddle will shower into an enormous number of decay products whose
multiplicity grows linearly with E, and whose average energy is independent of
E. Once these ultra-soft particles reach the interior they are thermalized by
the plasma within, and so the object appears ``black.'' We determine some gross
properties like the size and temperature of the the plasma puddle in terms of
fundamental parameters in the gauge theory. Interestingly, demanding that the
plasma puddle emit thermal Hawking radiation implies that the object is black
(i.e. absorbs all incident particles), which implies classical stability, which
implies satisfaction of the Bekenstein entropy bound. Because of the AdS/CFT
duality and the many similarities between plasma puddles and black holes, we
conjecture that black objects are a robust feature of quantum gravity.

how system-size stochastic resonance arises naturally in this framework, and
then how the phenomenon of array-enhanced stochastic resonance can be further
enhanced by letting the diffusion coefficient depend on the field. A yet less
trivial generalization is exemplified by a stylized version of the
FitzHugh-Nagumo system, a paradigm of the activator-inhibitor class. After
discussing for this system the second aspect enumerated above, we derive from
it -through an adiabatic-like elimination of the inhibitor field- an effective
scalar model that includes a nonlocal contribution. Studying the role played by
the range of the nonlocal kernel and its effect on stochastic resonance, we
find an optimal range that maximizes the system's response.

the leading edge of the GW signal is redshifted more than the inner boundary of
the pulse. The GW pulse is distorted by the gravitational effect of the
self-energy residing in between these shells. We illustrate this distortion for
GW pulses from the final plunge of black hole (BH) binaries, leading to the
evolution of the GW profile as a function of the radial distance from the
source. The distortion depends on the total GW energy released and the duration
of the emission, scaled by the total binary mass, M. The effect should be
relevant in finite box simulations where the waveforms are extracted within a
radius of <~ 100M. For characteristic emission parameters at the final plunge
between binary BHs of arbitrary spins, this effect could distort the simulated
GW templates for LIGO and LISA by a fraction of 0.001. Accounting for the wave
distortion would significantly decrease the waveform extraction errors in
numerical simulations.

Our study has a significant contribution to the study of the evolution of gravitational waves in a curved space.

We have investigated the study of the dispersion of gravitational waves due to their own gravity.

parts of the SMC such as the ""Wing'' area, and towards the West and South. In
this paper we perform a first analysis of the stellar content in our SMC fields
through comparison with theoretical isochrones and color functions (CFs). We
find that the underlying spheroidally distributed population is composed of
both intermediate-age and old stars and that its age composition does not show
strong galacto-centric gradients. The three fields situated toward the east, in
the Wing region, show very active current star formation. However, only in the
eastern field closest to the center do we find an enhancement of recent star
formation with respect to a constant SFR(t). The fields corresponding to the
western side of the SMC present a much less populated young MS, and the CF
analysis indicates that the SFR(t) greatly diminished around 2 Gyr ago in these
parts. Field smc0057, the closest to the center of the galaxy and located in
the southern part, shows recent star formation, while the rest of the southern
fields present few bright MS stars. The structure of the red clump in all the
CMDs is consistent with the large amount of intermediate-age stars inferred
from the CMDs and color functions. None of the SMC fields presented here are
dominated by old stellar populations, a fact that is in agreement with the lack
of a conspicuous horizontal branch in all these SMC CMDs. This could indicate
that a disk population is ruling over a possible old halo in all the observed
fields.

white in the model of [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{73}, 3395 (1994)]. The
potential scientific and technological interest of this phenomenon calls for a
study of the effects of the noises' statistics and spectrum. This task is
facilitated if these noises are dynamically generated by means of stochastic
differential equations (SDE) driven by white noises. One such case is that of
Ornstein--Uhlenbeck noises which are stationary, with Gaussian pdf and a
variance reduced by the self-correlation time (\tau), and whose effect on the
NIPT phase diagram has been studied some time ago. Another such case is when
the stationary pdf is a (colored) Tsallis' (q)--\emph{Gaussian} which, being a
\emph{fat-tail} distribution for (q>1) and a \emph{compact-support} one for
(q<1), allows for a controlled exploration of the effects of the departure from
Gaussian statistics. As done before with stochastic resonance and other
phenomena, we now exploit this tool to study--within a simple mean-field
approximation and with an emphasis on the \emph{order parameter} and the
``\emph{susceptibility}''--the combined effect on NIPT of the noises'
statistics and spectrum. Even for relatively small (\tau), it is shown that
whereas fat-tail noise distributions ((q>1)) counteract the effect of
self-correlation, compact-support ones ((q<1)) enhance it. Also, an interesting
effect on the susceptibility is seen in the last case.

the knot A/B complex in the jet, which is consistent with synchrotron emission.
However, a synchrotron model cannot account for the observed {\it nuclear}
spectrum, even when contributions from the jet, necessary due to the degrading
of resolution with wavelength, are included. The Spitzer data show a clear
excess in the spectrum of the nucleus at wavelengths longer than 25 um, which
we model as thermal emission from cool dust at a characteristic temperature of
55 \pm 10 K, with an IR luminosity \sim 10^{39} {\rm ~erg ~s^{-1}}. Given
Spitzer's few-arcsecond angular resolution, the dust seen in the nuclear
spectrum could be located anywhere within ~5'' (390 pc) of the nucleus. In any

questions still remain. The methods used to analyze open cluster remnants and
criteria to define them as physical systems are not homogeneous. In this work
we present a systematic method for studying these objects that provides a view
of their properties and allows their characterization. Eighteen remnant
candidates are analyzed by means of photometric and proper motion data. These
data provide information on objects and their fields. We establish criteria for
characterizing open cluster remnants, taking observational uncertainties into
account. 2MASS J and H photometry is employed (i) to study structural
properties of the objects by means of radial stellar density profiles, (ii) to
test for any similarity between objects and fields with a statistical
comparison method applied to the distributions of stars in the CMDs, and (iii)
to obtain ages, reddening values, and distances from the CMD, taking an index
of isochrone fit into account. The UCAC2 proper motions allowed an objective
comparison between objects and large solid angle offset fields. The objective
analysis based on the present methods indicates 13 open-cluster remnants in the
sample. Evidence of the presence of binary stars is found, as expected for
dynamically evolved systems. Finally, we infer possible evolutionary stages
among remnants from the structure, proper motion, and CMD distributions. The
low stellar statistics for individual objects is overcome by means of the
construction of composite proper motion and CMD diagrams. The distributions of
remnants in the composite diagrams resemble the single-star and unresolved
binary star distributions of open clusters.

We have studied the occurrence of open clusters, forming a unified and highly systematic picture of their formation and evolution in the Milky Way. In addition, our study showed that some of the open clusters were much older than they were previously thought, indicating that they may have formed much earlier in the history of the galaxy. Moreover, we analyzed the spectral and kinematic properties of the closed clusters to determine their ages and distances. The results showed that some of the remnants were of a considerably older age than previously thought, suggesting that they may have formed in the course of a long period of history.

describing a self-synchronizing phase transition in a system of globally
coupled oscillators that in general have different characteristic frequencies.
The reformulated model provides an alternative coherent framework through which
one can analytically tackle synchronization problems that are not amenable to
the original Kuramoto analysis. It allows one to solve explicitly for the
synchronization order parameter and the critical point of 1) the full
phase-locking transition for a system with a finite number of oscillators
(unlike the original Kuramoto model, which is solvable implicitly only in the
mean-field limit) and 2) a new class of continuum systems. It also makes it
possible to probe the system's dynamics as it moves towards a steady state.
While discussion in this paper is restricted to systems with global coupling,
the new formalism introduced by the linear reformulation also lends itself to
solving systems that exhibit local or asymmetric coupling.
","We present a unified model of the Kuramoto model for the analysis of the synchronization of complex systems. The Kuramoto model is an extremely important model for the study of synchronization in complex systems, but it is not linear, and it is difficult to analyze and understand its behavior. We present a unified model for the analysis of synchronization in complex systems, and we are able to apply the same principle to the synchronization of self-synchronization systems. Our unified model also allows for new theoretical studies, such as analyzing the dynamics of time-varying networks and examining the effect of noise on self-synchronization. We show that our unified model shows that the unified model is able to resolve the synchronization of self-synchronization. We show that our unified model has the fundamental features of the original model, and that the changes of the variables are able to reduce the non-linearity. This is an important contribution to the field of non-linearity and opens up new possibilities for study of synchronization in complex systems.

unique, although the ambiguity is essentially finite. We investigate the
combinatorics that depicts this ambiguity. We link these results with some
classical theorems of harmonic analysis, theorems that describe decompositions
of functions into sums of spherical harmonics. We extend these classical
theorems (which rely on our understanding of the Laplace operator
$\Delta_{S^2}$) to more general differential operators $\Delta_Q$ that are
constructed with the help of the quadratic form $Q(x, y, z)$. Then we introduce
modular spaces of multipoles. We study their intricate geometry and topology
using methods of algebraic geometry and singularity theory. The multipole
spaces are ramified over vector or projective spaces, and the compliments to
the ramification sets give rise to a rich family of $K(\pi, 1)$-spaces, where

Using the multipole method, we prove that the relationship of each component of the function with its individual components enables us to more easily explain the behavior of a function. Our method addresses this problem by breaking down the complex behavior of functions on curved surfaces into their individual components. This problem is a challenge that prevents us from defining in advance the underlying physical and mathematical reasons that govern the behavior of the function on the curved surface. The multipole method has a certain advantages over the traditional methods, and our results indicate that the technique has the potential to improve the understanding of the behavior of complex functions.

globular clusters and 780 planetary nebulae, the rotation amplitude, rotation

sample into 158 metal-rich ([Fe/H] > -1.0) and 178 metal-poor ([Fe/H] < -1.0)
globular clusters. Our results show the kinematics of the metal-rich and
metal-poor subpopulations are quite similar. The kinematics are compared to the
planetary nebula population where differences are apparent in the outer regions
of the halo. The total mass of NGC 5128 is found using the Tracer Mass
estimator (Evans et al. 2003), to determine the mass supported by internal
random motions, and the spherical component of the Jeans equation to determine
the mass supported by rotation. We find a total mass of (1.0+/-0.2) x 10^(12)

a few years. HD 11506 is a G0V star with a planet of \msini = 4.74 \mjup in a
3.85 year orbit. HD 17156 is a G0V star with a 3.12 \mjup planet in a 21.2 day
orbit. The eccentricity of this orbit is 0.67, one of the highest known for a
planet with a relatively short period. The orbital period for this planet
places it in a region of parameter space where relatively few planets have been
detected. HD 125612 is a G3V star with a planet of \msini = 3.5 \mjup in a 1.4

3.13 year orbit. HD 231701 is an F8V star with planet of 1.08 \mjup in a 142
day orbit. All of these stars have supersolar metallicity. Three of the five
stars were observed photometrically but showed no evidence of brightness
variability. A transit search conducted for HD 17156 was negative but covered
only 25% of the search space and so is not conclusive.

distributions (CPD) of giant pulse energies were analyzed for groups of GPs
with different effective widths in the range 4 to 65 microseconds. The CPDs
were found to manifest notable differences for the different GP width groups.
The slope of a power-law fit to the high-energy portion of the CPDs evolves
from -1.7 to -3.2 when going from the shortest to the longest GPs. There are
breaks in the CPD power-law fits indicating flattening at low energies with
indices varying from -1.0 to -1.9 for the short and long GPs respectively. The
GPs with a stronger peak flux density were found to be of shorter duration. We

breaking the age--metallicity degeneracy are quantified by an uncertainty

used to constrain the two above stellar-population parameters. This will be
very useful for exploring the stellar populations of distant galaxies. In
detail, colour pairs [(r-K), (u-R)] and [(r-K), (u-r)] are shown to be the best
pairs for estimating stellar ages and metallicities. They can constrain two
stellar-population parameters on average with age uncertainties less than 3.89

the Sun. Our work extends previous results by Masset and Snellgrove (2001), by
exploring a wider set of initial conditions and disk parameters, and by using a
new hydrodynamical code that properly describes for the global viscous
evolution of the disk. Initially both planets migrate towards the Sun, and
Saturn's migration tends to be faster. As a consequence, they eventually end up
locked in a mean motion resonance. If this happens in the 2:3 resonance, the
resonant motion is particularly stable, and the gaps opened by the planets in
the disk may overlap. This causes a drastic change in the torque balance for
the two planets, which substantially slows down the planets' inward migration.
If the gap overlap is substantial, planet migration may even be stopped or
reversed. As the widths of the gaps depend on disk viscosity and scale height,
this mechanism is particularly efficient in low viscosity, cool disks. We
discuss the compatibility of our results with the initial conditions adopted in
Tsiganis et al. (2005) and Gomes et al. (2005) to explain the current orbital

with {\em inelastic} collisions. Under rapid flow conditions, the macroscopic
behavior of grains can be described through hydrodynamic equations. At
low-density, a fundamental basis for the derivation of the hydrodynamic
equations and explicit expressions for the transport coefficients appearing in
them is provided by the Boltzmann kinetic theory conveniently modified to
account for inelastic binary collisions. The goal of this chapter is to give an
overview of the recent advances made for binary granular gases by using kinetic
theory tools. Some of the results presented here cover aspects such as
transport properties, energy nonequipartition, instabilities, segregation or
mixing, non-Newtonian behavior, .... In addition, comparison of the analytical
results with those obtained from Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations
is also carried out, showing the reliability of kinetic theory to describe
granular flows even for strong dissipation.
","As a result of the research, we propose a theory of kinetics for granular materials in low density. Our theory is based on the Boltzmann equation, which is a mathematical basis for all mechanical processes, and on the kinetic theory. We are concerned with the study of the physics of the granular materials in the industrial and natural world. We assume the granular mixture is a dilute gas and is intermixed with liquids, which are elastic and frictional. Our theory is based on the theory of kinetics for granular materials in the industrial and natural world. We are based on the theory of kinetics, and our result can be used for the improvement of the design and operation of the process. The main motivation of our study is that we can understand the kinetics of granular mixtures in a logical and practical sense. We have derived the Boltzmann equation, which is the foundation of statistical mechanics, and we have developed two-dimensional equations, which describe the velocity distribution of the two kinds of particles, the normal and the normal stresses, the diffusion coefficient and the thermal conductivity.

orbital eccentricities (< 0.27) indicating that their second-born neutron stars
received only very small velocity kicks at birth. This is similar to the case
of the B-emission X-ray binaries, where a sizable fraction of the neutron stars
received hardly any velocity kick at birth (Pfahl et al. 2002). The masses of
the second-born neutron stars in five of the six low-eccentricity double
neutron stars are remarkably low (between 1.18 and 1.30 Msun). It is argued
that these low-mass, low-kick neutron stars were formed by the electron-capture
collapse of the degenerate O-Ne-Mg cores of helium stars less massive than
about 3.5 Msun, whereas the higher-mass, higher kick-velocity neutron stars
were formed by the collapses of the iron cores of higher initial mass. The
absence of low-velocity single young radio pulsars (Hobbs et al. 2005) is
consistent with the model proposed by Podsiadlowski et al. (2004), in which the
electron-capture collapse of degenerate O-Ne-Mg cores can only occur in binary
systems, and not in single stars.
","Moreover, it was a question of examining the origin of X-ray spectroscopy, which revealed two major elements: the first is the collapse of massive stars into neutron stars, followed by the forming of an envelope phase, where the two neutron stars form a close binary system, and the second is the evolution of a low-mass X-ray binaries, where the neutron star combines material from another star, and eventually a X-ray binaries. The spectroscopic study of X-ray spectroscopy and the theory of the formation of neutron stars are a major step in the evolution of huge stars and compact objects. Our research is motivated by the desire to learn the dominant formation mechanism of X-rays, and to show how a dense, compact object is born. In this way, we propose to explain the formation of X-rays, and to give an account of the formation of large stars and of compact objects.

Use active voice.","  In this paper, we present a new implementation of feedback due to active
galactic nuclei (AGN) in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation. We
assume that a fraction of jet energy, which is generated by an AGN, is
transferred to the surrounding gas as thermal energy. Combining a theoretical
model of mass accretion onto black holes with a multiphase description of
star-forming gas, we self-consistently follow evolution of both galaxies and
their central black holes. The novelty in our model is that we consider two
distinct accretion modes: standard radiatively efficient thin accretion disks
and radiatively inefficient accretion flows which we will generically refer to
as RIAFs; motivated by theoretical models for jet production in accretion
disks, we assume that only the RIAF is responsible for the AGN feedback. We
find that, after an initial episode of bursting star formation, the accretion
rate onto the central black hole drops so that the accretion disk switches to a
RIAF structure. At this point, the feedback from the AGN becomes efficient and
slightly suppresses star formation in the galactic disk and almost completely
halts star formation in the bulge. As a result, the nucleus becomes a
stochastically fuelled low-luminosity AGN (Seyfert galaxy) with recurrent
short-lived episodes of activity after the star bursts. Our model predicts
several properties of the low-luminosity AGN including the bolometric
luminosity, jet powers, the effect on kpc-scale of the radio jet and the AGN
lifetime, which are in broad agreement with observations of Seyfert galaxies
and their radio activity. We also find that the mass ratios between the central
black hole and the the host spheroid at z = 0 are ~10^{-3} regardless of the
strength of either supernova feedback or AGN feedback. (abridged)
","This is a complicated process that requires the cooling of the gas in the dark matter halo. It has been proposed that this feedback from the epoch is crucial to the formation of the galaxies, but the precise nature of this feedback is not well understood. Our study aims to enlighten this gap in the knowledge of galaxy formation and evolution. Our study, using the state-of-the-art IllustrisTNG simulation, is based on the fundamentals of a sphere-shaped epoch, and is based on a subgrid model of the epoch of the epoch, which takes into account both thermal and kinetic energy. This is the first study to study the effect of radio-active AGNs on the formation and growth of a disk. In the strong-back scenario, the enormous black holes suppress the growth of the extended disks by heating and disrupting the surrounding halo. In the weak-back situation, the growth of the disks is more restricted, resulting in a more extended and rotationally stable form.

widths of line wings and methanol maser emission suggests that the 6.7GHz maser

conditions conducive for the methanol maser can exist in the inner parts of
molecular clouds or circumstellar discs as well as in the outer parts

the characteristics of this signal from the epoch of recombination: the peak

associated to dust millimeter cores of the Vela Molecular Ridge Cloud D through

The association of mm continuum emission with infrared sources from catalogues
(IRAS, MSX, 2MASS), JHK data from the literature and new observations, has been
established according to spatial coincidence, infrared colours and spectral
energy distributions. Only 7 out of 29 resolved mm cores (and 16 out of the 26
unresolved ones) do not exhibit signposts of star formation activity. The other
ones are clearly associated with: far-IR sources, H_2 jets or near-IR objects
showing a high intrinsic colour excess. The distribution of the spectral
indices pertaining to the associated sources is peaked at values typical of
Class I objects, while three objects are signalled as candidates Class 0
sources. We remark the high detection rate (30%) of H_2 jets driven by sources
located inside the mm-cores. They appear not driven by the most luminous
objects in the field, but rather by less luminous objects in young clusters,
testifying the co-existence of both low- and intermediate-mass star formation.
The presented results reliably describe the young population of VMR-D. However,
the statistical evaluation of activity vs inactivity of the investigated cores,
even in good agreement with results found for other star forming regions, seems
to reflect the limiting sensitivity of the available facilities rather than any
property intrinsic to the mm-condensations.

monotonic behaviour of $N(t)$ for arbitrary values of $\gamma_L, \gamma_S$ and

reported for the peculiar A supergiant, single-lined spectroscopic binary HR

several H2O vibration-rotation transitions have been observed in the
near-infrared spectrum. The spectrum of HR 4049 appears principally in emission
through the 3 and 4.6 micron region and in absorption in the 2 micron region.
The 4.6 micron spectrum shows a rich 'forest' of emission lines. All the
spectral lines observed in the 2.3-4.6 micron spectrum are shown to be
circumbinary in origin. The presence of OH and H2O lines confirm the
oxygen-rich nature of the circumbinary gas which is in contrast to the
previously detected carbon-rich material. The emission and absorption line
profiles show that the circumbinary gas is located in a thin, rotating layer
near the dust disk. The properties of the dust and gas circumbinary disk and
the spectroscopic orbit yield masses for the individual stars, M_AI~0.58 Msolar
and M_MV~0.34 Msolar. Gas in the disk also has an outward flow with a velocity
of $\gtrsim$ 1 km/s. The severe depletion of refractory elements but near-solar
abundances of volatile elements observed in HR 4049 results from abundance
winnowing. The separation of the volatiles from the grains in the disk and the
subsequent accretion by the star are discussed. Contrary to prior reports, the

heats up with the application of a magnetic field around the Curie point due to
the conventional magnetocaloric effect. In contrast, the inverse magnetocaloric
effect associated with the martensitic transition results in the unusual
decrease of temperature by adiabatic magnetization. We also provide
magnetization and specific heat data which enable to compare the measured
temperature changes to the values indirectly computed from thermodynamic
relationships. Good agreement is obtained for the conventional effect at the
second-order paramagnetic-ferromagnetic phase transition. However, at the first
order structural transition the measured values at high fields are lower than
the computed ones. Irreversible thermodynamics arguments are given to show that
such a discrepancy is due to the irreversibility of the first-order martensitic
transition.

Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2003du was obtained using a number of facilities. The
observations started 13 days before B-band maximum light and continued for 480
days with exceptionally good time sampling. The optical photometry was
calibrated through the S-correction technique.
  The UBVRIJHK light curves and the color indices of SN 2003du closely resemble
those of normal SNe Ia. SN 2003du reached a B-band maximum of 13.49 (+/-0.02)
mag on JD2452766.38 (+/-0.5). We derive a B-band stretch parameter of 0.988
(+/-0.003), which corresponds to dM15=1.02 (+/-0.05), indicative of a SN Ia of
standard luminosity. The reddening in the host galaxy was estimated by three
methods, and was consistently found to be negligible. We estimate a distance
modulus of 32.79 (+/-0.15) mag to the host galaxy, UGC 9391. The peak UVOIR
bolometric luminosity of 1.35(+/-0.20) 10^43 erg/s and Arnett's rule implies
that M(Ni56)=0.68 (+/-0.14)M_sun of Ni56 was synthesized during the explosion.
Modeling of the UVOIR bolometric light curve also indicates M(Ni56) in the
range 0.6-0.8 M_sun. The spectral evolution of SN 2003du at both optical and
NIR wavelengths also closely resembles normal SNe Ia. In particular, the Si II
ratio at maximum R(Si II)=0.22 (+/-0.02) and the time evolution of the
blueshift velocities of the absorption line minima are typical. The pre-maximum
spectra of SN 2003du showed conspicuous high-velocity features in the Ca II H&K
doublet and infrared triplet, and possibly in Si II 6355, lines. We compare the
time evolution of the profiles of these lines with other well-observed SNe Ia
and we suggest that the peculiar pre-maximum evolution of Si II 6355 line in
many SNe Ia is due to the presence of two blended absorption components.
","It was found that the SN of the Type Ia Supernova (Sn) had a luminous radiance equal to that of the normal SN, and this radiance was characterized as normal for the SN. The spectra showed that the SN was an asymmetrical supernova, of the type II-P and the type II-L nebulae. The spectral spectra of SN 2003 were used to analyze and show that it possessed a normal spectral inclination, as described in the standard SN Ia. The spectra showed that SN 2003 was an extremely light-tight and steady-state supernova, as compared with subclass Ia. In short, the observation revealed the importance of continuing the study of the various supernovae, whose diversity and physical properties can be learned. The present work, analyzing the light curves of SN 2003, was a comprehensive investigation of the spectra of the supernova type Ia of SN 2003.

ongoing shocks to replenish the SiO. We serendipitously detected SO$_2$ towards
17 sources in the same tuning as HCO$^+$. We detected HCO$^+$ towards all

of H$^{13}$CO$^+$ tends to increase along with the abundance of SiO in sources
for which we could determine abundances. We discuss these results with respect
to current theories of massive star formation via accretion. From this survey,
we suggest that perhaps both models of ionized accretion and halted accretion

protostars) beyond the formation of an HII region.

large-Nc limit from the mathematical theory of Pade Approximants to meromorphic
functions. These approximants are rational functions which encompass any
saturation with a finite number of resonances as a particular example,
explaining several results which have appeared in the literature. We review the
main properties of Pade Approximants with the help of a toy model for the
<VV-AA> two-point correlator, paying particular attention to the relationship
among the Chiral Expansion, the Operator Product Expansion and the resonance
spectrum. In passing, we also comment on an old proposal made by Migdal in 1977
which has recently attracted much attention in the context of AdS/QCD models.
Finally, we apply the simplest Pade Approximant to the <VV-AA> correlator in
the real case of QCD. The general conclusion is that a rational approximant may
reliably describe a Green's function in the Euclidean, but the same is not true
in the Minkowski regime due to the appearance of unphysical poles and/or
residues.

structural instabilities on magnetic ordering can be understood in terms of how
super-exchange interactions depend on the Cr-O-Cr bond angles and Cr-O bond
lengths. We demonstrate how adequate buckling of Cr-O-Cr chains can favour
ferromagnetism. Born effective charges (BEC) calculated using the Berry phase

Kerr black holes, which are characterized by a ""humpy frequency"" f_h, that
could excite the radial and vertical epicyclic oscillations with frequencies

are allowed as well. Assuming mass M=14.8M_sun and spin a=0.9998 for the GRS

Reynolds number. The polymer ensemble is described on the mesoscopic level by a

Momentum transfer of the dumbbells with the solvent is implemented by an
additional volume forcing term in the Navier-Stokes equations, such that both
components of the resulting viscoelastic fluid are connected by a two-way
coupling. The dynamics of the dumbbells is given then by Newton's second law of
motion including small inertia effects. We investigate the dynamics of the flow
for different degrees of dumbbell elasticity and inertia, as given by
Weissenberg and Stokes numbers, respectively. For the parameters accessible in
our study, the magnitude of the feedback of the polymers on the macroscopic
properties of turbulence remains small as quantified by the global energy
budget and the Reynolds stresses. A reduction of the turbulent drag by up to
20% is observed for the larger particle inertia. The angular statistics of the
dumbbells shows an increasing alignment with the mean flow direction for both,
increasing elasticity and inertia. This goes in line with a growing asymmetry
of the probability density function of the transverse derivative of the

referentially in regions where vortex stretching or bi-axial strain dominate

cutoff. While the renormalizable Standard Model forbids proton decay mediating
operators due to accidental global symmetries, many extensions of the Standard
Model introduce such dimension four, five and six operators. Furthermore,
quantum gravity effects are expected to induce proton instability, indicating
that the higher energy cutoff scale must be above 10^{16}GeV. Quasi-realistic
heterotic string models provide the arena to explore how perturbative quantum
gravity affects the particle physics phenomenology. An appealing explanation
for the proton longevity is provided by the existence of an Abelian gauge
symmetry that suppresses the proton decay mediating operators. Additionally,
such a low-scale U(1) symmetry should: allow the suppression of the left-handed
neutrino masses by a seesaw mechanism; allow fermion Yukawa couplings to the
electroweak Higgs doublets; be anomaly free; be family universal. These
requirements render the existence of such U(1) symmetries in quasi-realistic
heterotic string models highly non-trivial. We demonstrate the existence of a
U(1) symmetry that satisfies all of the above requirements in a class of
left-right symmetric heterotic string models in the free fermionic formulation.

decay mediation. We further show that while the extra U(1) forbids dimension
four baryon number violating operators it allows dimension four lepton number
violating operators and R-parity violation.

consequently the total entropy of solutions becomes smaller than the annealed
one. Another transition takes place when in all the entropically dominant
states a finite fraction of nodes freezes so that each of these nodes is
allowed a single color in all the solutions inside the state. Eventually, above
the coloring threshold, no more solutions are available. We compute all the
critical connectivities for Erdos-Renyi and regular random graphs and determine
their asymptotic values for large number of colors.
  Finally, we discuss the algorithmic consequences of our findings. We argue
that the onset of computational hardness is not associated with the clustering
transition and we suggest instead that the freezing transition might be the
relevant phenomenon. We also discuss the performance of a simple local Walk-COL
algorithm and of the belief propagation algorithm in the light of our results.
","The result is that the minimum number of colors needed to color a graph is increased as the graph size increases or the density of the edge increases. In this study, we analyze the effect of the phase transition in the coloring of a graph. In this study, we examine the properties of the graphs with respect to the chromatic number, that is, the minimum number of colors required to color the vertices of a graph, and the color of the adjacent vertices. The study investigates the chromatic number of the graphs with respect to the chromatic number, that is, the minimum number of colors necessary to color the vertices of the graph, which is in a condition of varying density. This chromatic number is a fundamental property of graphs, and it can be used to design efficient algorithms for coloring graphs. We have a statistical analysis of the chromatic number of the graphs produced by the model Erds-Rényi and the configuration model. The result shows that the threshold of the chromatic number of the graphs is sharp, that is, the minimum number of colors required to color a graph changes abruptly as the graph size or the density increases.

Optimization of a parametrized integral (MCO), Parametric machine-Learning
(PL), and `blackbox' or `oracle'-based optimization (BO). We make four
contributions. First, we prove that MCO is mathematically identical to a broad
class of PL problems. This identity potentially provides a new application
domain for all broadly applicable PL techniques: MCO. Second, we introduce
immediate sampling, a new version of the Probability Collectives (PC) algorithm
for blackbox optimization. Immediate sampling transforms the original BO
problem into an MCO problem. Accordingly, by combining these first two
contributions, we can apply all PL techniques to BO. In our third contribution
we validate this way of improving BO by demonstrating that cross-validation and
bagging improve immediate sampling. Finally, conventional MC and MCO procedures
ignore the relationship between the sample point locations and the associated
values of the integrand; only the values of the integrand at those locations
are considered. We demonstrate that one can exploit the sample location
information using PL techniques, for example by forming a fit of the sample
locations to the associated values of the integrand. This provides an
additional way to apply PL techniques to improve MCO.

chemically homogeneous, differentially rotating, main-sequence stars of mass
1-2 M_sun. The models were constructed using a code based on a reformulation of
the self-consistent field method of computing the equilibrium stellar structure
for a specified conservative internal rotation law. [abridged] Relative to
nonrotating stars of the same mass, these models all have reduced luminosities
and effective temperatures, and flattened photospheric shapes (i.e., decreased
polar radii) with equatorial radii that can be larger or smaller, depending on
the degree of differential rotation. For a fixed ratio of the axial rotation
rate to the surface equatorial rotation rate, increasingly rapid rotation
generally deepens convective envelopes, shrinks convective cores, and can lead
to the presence of a convective core (envelope) in a 1 M_sun (2 M_sun) model, a
feature that is absent in a nonrotating star of the same mass. The positions of
differentially rotating models for a given mass M in the H-R diagram can be
shifted in such a way as to approximate the nonrotating ZAMS over ranges in
luminosity and effective temperature that correspond to a mass interval between
M and about 0.7 M. We briefly note a few of the implications of these results,
including (i) possible ambiguities arising from similarities between the
properties of rotating and nonrotating models of different masses, (ii) a
reduced radiative luminosity for a young, rapidly rotating Sun, (iii) the
nuclear destruction of lithium and other light metallic species in the layers
beneath an outer convective envelope, and (iv), the excitation of solar-like
oscillations and the operation of a solar-like hydromagnetic dynamo in some
1.5-2 M_sun stars.
","The main idea is to understand how rotation affects the formation of the main sequence, to study the structure and properties of the main sequences. This is important because the rotational process of stars is an essential element in the evolution of the stars, and its properties can be measured. In addition, recent observations have revealed striking properties in the rotation of low- and medium-mass stars, and therefore we need to investigate the mechanism of rotation. This research is based on the idea that rotation is an essential element of the stellar evolution, and it affects the luminosity, temperature and the surface abundance of the stars. In this study, we investigated the properties of the main sequences in the 1-2 M star range. Our results show that the rotational rotation can affect the evolution and the properties of the main sequences significantly, in particular, the formation of magnetic fields and the distribution of convective zones.

transported through its surface layers. We study the resulting differentially
rotating profile, focusing on the impact this has for type I X-ray bursts. The
predominant viscosity is likely provided by the Tayler-Spruit dynamo. The
radial and azimuthal magnetic field components have strengths of ~10^5 G and
~10^10 G, respectively. This leads to nearly uniform rotation at the depths of
interest for X-ray bursts. A remaining small shear transmits the accreted
angular momentum inward to the NS interior. Though this shear gives little
viscous heating, it can trigger turbulent mixing. Detailed simulations will be
required to fully understand the consequences of mixing, but our models
illustrate some general features. Mixing has the greatest impact when the
buoyancy at the compositional discontinuity between accreted matter and ashes
is overcome. This occurs at high accretion rates, at low spin frequencies, or
may depend on the ashes from the previous burst. We then find two new regimes
of burning. The first is ignition in a layer containing a mixture of heavier
elements from the ashes. If ignition occurs at the base of the mixed layer,
recurrence times as short as ~5-30 minutes are possible. This may explain the
short recurrence time of some bursts, but incomplete burning is still needed to
explain these bursts' energetics. When mixing is sufficiently strong, a second
regime is found where accreted helium mixes deep enough to burn stably,
quenching X-ray bursts. We speculate that the observed change in X-ray burst
properties near one-tenth the Eddington accretion rate is from this mechanism.
The carbon-rich material produced by stable helium burning would be important
for triggering and fueling superbursts. (abridged)

X-ray afterglow of GRB 050730 was found to decline with time with superimposed
intense flaring activity that extended over more than two orders of magnitude
in time. Seven distinct re-brightening events starting from 236 s up to 41.2 ks
after the burst were observed. The underlying decay of the afterglow was well
described by a double broken power-law model with breaks at t_1= 237 +/- 20 s

after these breaks were alpha_1 = 2.1 +/- 0.3, alpha_2 = 0.44 (-0.08) (+0.14)

afterglow was well described by a photoelectrically absorbed power-law with an
absorbing column density N_H=(1.28 +/- 0.26) 10^22 cm^-2 in the host galaxy.
Strong X-ray spectral evolution during the flaring activity was present. In the
majority of the flares (6/7) the ratio Delta_t/t_p between the duration of the
event and the time when the flare peaks was nearly constant and about 0.6-0.7.
We showed that the observed spectral and temporal properties of the first three
flares are consistent with being due both to high-latitude emission, as
expected if the flares were produced by late internal shocks, or to refreshed
shocks, i.e. late time energy injections into the main afterglow shock by slow
moving shells ejected from the central engine during the prompt phase. The
event fully satisfies the E_p-E_iso Amati relation while is not consistent with

spectral energy distribution can be approximated by a two-temperature model (25
and 63 K) with a total luminosity of approximately log(L/Lsun)=5.2. Previous
submm imaging resolved this region into a cluster of 5 dust cores, one of which
is associated with the UCHII region G23.96+0.15, and another with an H2O maser.
In our new 2.7 mm continuum image, only the UCHII region is detected, with
total flux and morphology in good agreement with the free-free emission in VLA
cm-wave maps. For the other four objects, the nondetections at 2.7 mm and in
the MSX mid-IR bands are consistent with cool dust emission with a temperature
of 13-40K and luminosity of 1000-40000 Lsun. By combining single-dish and
interferometric data, we have identified over two dozen virialized C18O cores
in this region that contain ~40% of the total molecular gas mass present. While
the overall extent of the C18O and dust emission is similar, the emission peaks
do not correlate well in detail. At least 11 of the 123 stars identified by
2MASS in this region are likely to be within the star-forming cluster. Two
stars (both associated with the UCHII region) were previously identified as O
stars via IR spectroscopy. Most of the rest of the reddened stars have no
obvious correlation with the C18O cores or the dust cores. In summary, our
observations indicate that considerable fragmentation of the molecular cloud
has taken place during the time required for the UCHII region to form and the O
stars to become detectable at IR wavelengths. Additional star formation appears
to be ongoing on the periphery of the central region, where up to four B-type
(proto)stars have formed among a substantial number of C18O molecular cores.

is most likely due to accretion disc surface brightness distribution
variations, most probably caused by strong flickering. Time-dependent accretion
disc self-occultation or variations of the hot spot(s) intensity are also
possible explanations. Negative superhumps with period of ~0.145 day are

feedback from each receiver. In this work it is shown that channel feedback
requirements can be significantly reduced if each receiver has a small number
of antennas and appropriately combines its antenna outputs. A combining method
that minimizes channel quantization error at each receiver, and thereby
minimizes multi-user interference, is proposed and analyzed. This technique is
shown to outperform traditional techniques such as maximum-ratio combining

Our work is based on the wide-ranging application of stochastic heat equations to several fields, such as physics, finance, biology, engineering, and physics.

from the UVES Paranal Observatory Project, plus HI 21-cm spectra from the
Vila-Elisa and Leiden-Dwingeloo surveys, which are employed to obtain distances
to intermediate and high velocity clouds. HI emission at a velocity of -117
km/s towards the sightline HD 30677 with NHI=1.7x10^19 cm-2 has no
corresponding CaII K absorption, which has a signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of
610. The star has a spectroscopically determined distance of 2.7-kpc, and hence
sets this as a firm lower distance limit towards Anti-Centre cloud ACII.
Towards another sightline (HD 46185), HI at +122 km/s and NHI=1.2x10^19 cm-2 is
seen. The CaII K spectrum has a S/N = 780, although no absorption is observed
at the cloud velocity. This similarly places a firm lower distance limit of
2.9-kpc towards this parcel of gas that may be an intermediate velocity cloud.
The lack of intermediate velocity (IV) CaII K absorption towards HD 196426 at a
S/N = 500 reinforces a lower distance limit of 700-pc towards this part of
Complex gp, where NHI is 1.1x10^19 cm-2 and velocity is +78 km/s. Additionally,
no IV CaII K is seen in absorption in the spectrum of HD 19445, which is strong
in HI with NHI=8x10^19 cm-2 at -42 km/s, placing a firm although uninteresting
lower distance limit of 39-pc to this part of IV South. Finally, no HV CaII K
absorption is seen towards HD 115363 at a S/N = 410, placing a lower distance
of 3.2-kpc towards the HVC gas at velocity of +224 km/s and NHI=5.2x10^19 cm-2.
This gas is in the same region of the sky as complex WE (Wakker 2001), but at
higher velocities. The non-detection of CaII K absorption sets a lower distance
of 3.2-kpc towards the HVC, which is unsurprising if this feature is indeed
related to the Magellanic System.

substructure on the minor axis, together with the fact that the light profile
between 0.5 < R < 1.3 follows the exponential ``extended disk'', is
particularly important in shedding light on the mixed and sometimes conflicting
results reported in previous studies. Underlying the substructures lies a
faint, metal-poor, smooth and extremely extended halo, reaching out to at least
150 kpc. The smooth halo component in M31 has a profile that can be fit with a
Hernquist model of immense scale radius ~55 kpc, almost a factor of 4 larger
than theoretical predictions. Alternatively a power-law with exponent -1.91 +/-
0.11 can be fit to the profile. The total luminosity of this structure is
similar to that of the halo of the Milky Way. This vast, smooth, underlying
halo is reminiscent of a classical monolithic model and completely unexpected
from modern galaxy formation models. M33 is also found to have an extended
metal-poor halo component, which can be fit with a Hernquist model also of

information about the space of string vacua in the form of statistical
correlations between phenomenological features that are otherwise uncorrelated
in field theory. Such correlations would thus represent predictions of string
theory that hold independently of a vacuum-selection principle. In this paper,
we study statistical correlations between two features which are likely to be
central to any potential description of nature at high energy scales: gauge
symmetries and spacetime supersymmetry. We analyze correlations between these
two kinds of symmetry within the context of perturbative heterotic string
vacua, and find a number of striking features. We find, for example, that the
degree of spacetime supersymmetry is strongly correlated with the probabilities
of realizing certain gauge groups, with unbroken supersymmetry at the string
scale tending to favor gauge-group factors with larger rank. We also find that
nearly half of the heterotic landscape is non-supersymmetric and yet
tachyon-free at tree level; indeed, less than a quarter of the tree-level
heterotic landscape exhibits any supersymmetry at all at the string scale.

The work of this kind is to be carried out in a manner that is consistent with the principles of gravity and the universal order. The problem I seek to solve is the long-standing tension between the two symmetries, which sometimes appear to be incompatible in some situations. This problem is based on the fact that in certain circumstances both the supersymmetry and the gauge are enshrined, and in such cases they are able to reconcile themselves. This new process can be analyzed dynamically, and the gauge is left intact. This method can explain, for example, the small value of the cosmological constant of our universe.

adiabatically, then a dense ""spike"" of dark matter is expected to have formed
around it. Assuming that dark matter is composed primarily of weakly
interacting massive particles (WIMPs), a star orbiting close enough to the SMBH
can capture WIMPs at an extremely high rate. The stellar luminosity due to
annihilation of captured WIMPs in the stellar core may be comparable to or even
exceed the luminosity of the star due to thermonuclear burning. The model thus
predicts the existence of unusual stars, i.e. ""WIMP burners"", in the vicinity
of an adiabatically grown SMBH. We find that the most efficient WIMP burners
are stars with degenerate electron cores, e.g. white dwarfs (WD) or degenerate
cores with envelopes. If found, such stars would provide evidence for the
existence of particle dark matter and could possibly be used to establish its
density profile. In our previous paper we computed the luminosity from WIMP
burning for a range of dark matter spike density profiles, degenerate core
masses, and distances from the SMBH. Here we compare our results with the
observed stars closest to the Galactic center and find that they could be
consistent with WIMP burners in the form of degenerate cores with envelopes. We
also cross-check the WIMP burner hypothesis with the EGRET observed flux of
gamma-rays from the Galactic center, which imposes a constraint on the dark
matter spike density profile and annihilation cross-section. We find that the
EGRET data is consistent with the WIMP burner hypothesis. New high precision
measurements by GLAST will confirm or set stringent limits on a dark matter
spike at the Galactic center, which will in turn support or set stringent
limits on the existence of WIMP burners at the Galactic center.
","This research is especially suited to the search for dark matter in the central region of the Galaxy, where there is a great deal of matter and dark matter. It is also a favorable region for searches of dark matter, because it is so dense and so filled with dark matter. Moreover, it is a very important subject in the physics of the universe, because if it is understood and analyzed, it will lead to the more general laws of the universe. This method is useful for investigating dark matter in the central region, and in the future it will be useful for us to find out more about the dark matter in the galaxy. Our study reveals that several of the gamma rays, such as those seen by Fermi-LAT, are associated with the burning of dark matter.

energy ($>1$ MeV) photon production inside a Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) fireball and
derive the expected high energy photon spectra from individual GRBs during the
prompt phase. The photon spectra of leptonic and hadronic origins are compared
within different sets of parameter regimes. Our results suggest that the high
energy emission is dominated by the leptonic component if fraction of shock
energy carried by electrons is not very small (e.g. $\epsilon_e > 10^{-3}$).
For very small values of $\epsilon_e$ the hadronic emission component could be
comparable to or even exceed the leptonic component in the GeV-TeV regime.
However, in this case a much larger energy budget of the fireball is required
to account for the same level of the observed sub-MeV spectrum. The fireballs
are therefore extremely inefficient in radiation. For a canonical fireball bulk
Lorentz factor (e.g. $\Gamma=400$), emissions above $\sim 10$ GeV are
attenuated by two-photon pair production processes. For a fireball with an even
higher Lorentz factor, the cutoff energy is higher, and emissions of 10 TeV -
PeV due to $\pi^0$-decay can also escape from the internal shocks. The flux
level is however too low to be detected by current TeV detectors, and these
photons also suffer attenuation by external soft photons.

various kinematics distributions of the final state leptons. For the $H\to WW$

The Sun’s magnetic field is a subject of intense research, and it is not yet understood how to calculate it, and the results are favourable. We present a model based on the theory of the magnetic field, which is insufficient for the prediction of the current solar cycle, and, moreover, in the estimation of the current cycle, we have developed an accurate and accurate prediction. The Sun’s activity is varied, and the number of Sunspots and the number of Faubrae varies continually. The timing and magnitude of the cycle can affect the climate and the technical infrastructure of the Earth. The results are obtained, and the model predicts the next fifteen solar cycles accurately. We make a new calculation of the next fifteen solar cycles. Our work demonstrates that our prediction is consistent with the observations and the observations made before.

systems is presented. The scheme assumes that the system can be represented by
a combination of components of only two different types: first-order low-pass
filters and static nonlinearities. The parameters of these filters and
nonlinearities may depend on system variables, and the topology of the system
may be complex, including feedback. Several examples taken from neuroscience
are given: phototransduction, photopigment bleaching, and spike generation
according to the Hodgkin-Huxley equations. The scheme uses two slightly
different forms of autoregressive filters, with an implicit delay of zero for
feedforward control and an implicit delay of half a sample distance for
feedback control. On a fairly complex model of the macaque retinal horizontal
cell it computes, for a given level of accuracy, 1-2 orders of magnitude faster
than 4th-order Runge-Kutta. The computational scheme has minimal memory
requirements, and is also suited for computation on a stream processor, such as
a GPU (Graphical Processing Unit).
","The present work is an application of the theory of recursive filters, a system that is widely used in digital signal processing. However, this system is particularly suitable for the simulation of complex systems, especially for the engineering, the economics and biology. Its application is not limited to linear systems, but rather to the study of the nonlinear and the complex, and it is proposed to be applied to nonlinear systems. This is the motivation for this research, which is mainly based on the need for the accurate simulation of complex systems, which is becoming increasingly popular in a wide range of fields, such as engineering, economics, biology, engineering, and so on. This is a novel and promising application of recursive filters to nonlinear systems, and is applied to a wide range of nonlinear and complex systems, including the chaotic and the differential equation.

and astrophysical parameters for 42 open clusters. While our sample is
definitively not representative of the total open cluster sample in the Galaxy,
it does cover a wide range of cluster parameters and is uniform enough to allow
for simple statistical considerations. BV wide-field CCD photometry was
obtained for open clusters for which photometric, structural, and dynamical
evolution parameters were determined. The limiting and core radii were
determined by analyzing radial density profiles. The ages, reddenings, and
distances were obtained from the solar metallicity isochrone fitting. The mass
function was used to study the dynamical state of the systems, mass segregation
effect and to estimate the total mass and number of cluster members. This study
reports on the first determination of basic parameters for 11 out of 42
observed open clusters. The angular sizes for the majority of the observed
clusters appear to be several times larger than the catalogue data indicate.
The core and limiting cluster radii are correlated and the latter parameter is
3.2 times larger on average. The limiting radius increases with the cluster's
mass, and both the limiting and core radii decrease in the course of dynamical
evolution. For dynamically not advanced clusters, the mass function slope is
similar to the universal IMF slope. For more evolved systems, the effect of
evaporation of low-mass members is clearly visible. The initial mass
segregation is present in all the observed young clusters, whereas the
dynamical mass segregation appears in clusters older than about log(age)=8.
Low-mass stars are deficient in the cores of clusters older than log(age)=8.5
and not younger than one relaxation time.
","They also showed that there were some large, unresolved binary systems and that some of them were mass-segregated.

The data we collected were collected by a few telescopes and CCD cameras at different sites, and we astrometrically inspected the data using Gaia DR2 data. We then interpreted the data and the color gradation of the images, the isochronal index and the mass of the clusters, and therefore obtained the basic physical properties of the clusters: their ages, their distances, their mass.

those with an orbital inclination near 90 degree, are of special interest to
derive physical properties of extrasolar planets. With the knowledge of the
host star's physical parameters, the planetary radius can be determined.
Combined with spectroscopic observations the mass and therefore the density can
be derived from Doppler-measurements. Depending on the brightness of the host
star, additional information, e. g. about the spin-orbit alignment between the
host star and planetary orbit, can be obtained.
  Aims: The last few years have witnessed a growing success of transit surveys.
Among other surveys, the MACHO project provided nine potential transiting
planets, several of them with relatively bright parent stars. The photometric
signature of a transit event is, however, insufficient to confirm the planetary
nature of the faint companion. The aim of this paper therefore is a
determination of the spectroscopic parameters of the host stars as well as a
dynamical mass determination through Doppler-measurements.
  Methods: We have obtained follow-up high-resolution spectra for five stars
selected from the MACHO sample, which are consistent with transits of
low-luminosity objects. Radial velocities have been determined by means of
cross-correlation with model spectra. The MACHO light curves have been compared
to simulations based on the physical parameters of the system derived from the
radial velocities and spectral analyses.
  Aims: We show that all transit light curves of the exoplanet candidates
analysed in this work can be explained by eclipses of stellar objects, hence
none of the five transiting objects is a planet.

magnetic field may together be used to produce entanglement for any finite
temperature by adjusting the external magnetic field beyond some finite
critical strength. This interesting result arises from an analysis employing
the Wootters concurrence, a computable measure of entanglement for two-qubit
states. Recently, Mintert {\em et al.} proposed generalizations of Wootters
concurrence for multipartite states. These MKB concurrences possess a
mathematical property that enables one to understand the origin of this
characteristic behavior. Here, we first study the effect of anisotropy and
magnetic field on the multipartite thermal entanglement of a four-qubit
Heisenberg XY chain using the MKB concurrences. We show that this model
exhibits characteristic behavior similar to that of the two-qubit model. In
addition, we show that this can again be understood using the same mathematical
property. Next, we show that the six-qubit Heisenberg XY chain possesses
properties necessary for it to have the characteristic behavior too. Most
importantly, it is possible to directly measure the multipartite MKB
concurrences of pure states. This may provide an experimental verification of
our conjecture that for a Heisenberg XY chain of any even number of qubits, it
is always possible to obtain non-zero genuine multipartite entanglement at any
finite temperature by applying a sufficiently large magnetic field.
","And, finally, our study provides insight into the important role of anisotropy and magnetic field in the property of the system in N-qubits, and thus opens up new avenues for studying the entanglement of quantum many-body systems. We develop an analytical and numerical measure of the GME of N-qubits, which is the measure of the degree and structure of the entanglement, and a mathematical measure of the GME, which gives the degree and structure of the entanglement in a single-pointed way, according to which the critical magnetic and magnetic values of the GME of a single-pointed way depend on the size of the chain, the symmetry of the system, and the temperature. The results show that the presence of magnetic and magnetic forces in a single-pointed way influences GME in a single-pointed way.

implementation of network applications. As network protocols have become
increasingly complex, however, hand-writing network message processing code has
become increasingly error-prone. In this paper, we present a domain-specific
language, Zebu, for describing protocol message formats and related processing
constraints. From a Zebu specification, a compiler automatically generates
stubs to be used by an application to parse network messages. Zebu is easy to
use, as it builds on notations used in RFCs to describe protocol grammars. Zebu
is also efficient, as the memory usage is tailored to application needs and
message fragments can be specified to be processed on demand. Finally,
Zebu-based applications are robust, as the Zebu compiler automatically checks
specification consistency and generates parsing stubs that include validation
of the message structure. Using a mutation analysis in the context of SIP and
RTSP, we show that Zebu significantly improves application robustness.
","I want to show that this method will improve the robustness of network communication systems. It is a fundamental process to develop a language, which is more robust, and can be applied to any protocol.

The approach we have proposed is a language-based one, and the language we have developed is a type system which requires more invariants in the definition and implementation of the protocol. The results are illustrated by the results of a case study of the Stream Control Protocol (SCTP), which has a low probability of being prone to error, and in this case it was a case of subtle inconsistencies in the language. The results are shown to be of great benefit, and so their reliability is improved.

resolutions down to 0.085arcsec, corresponding to length scales of less than
10pc in some objects. Our data were taken mostly with the near infrared
adaptive optics integral field spectrograph SINFONI. The stellar light profiles
typically have size scales of a few tens of parsecs. In two cases there is
unambiguous kinematic evidence for stellar disks on these scales. In the
nuclear regions there appear to have been recent - but no longer active -
starbursts in the last 10-300Myr. The stellar luminosity is less than a few
percent of the AGN in the central 10pc, whereas on kiloparsec scales the
luminosities are comparable. The surface stellar luminosity density follows a
similar trend in all the objects, increasing steadily at smaller radii up to
10^{13}L_sun/kpc^2 in the central few parsecs, where the mass surface density
exceeds 10^4M_sun/pc^2. The intense starbursts were probably Eddington limited
and hence inevitably short-lived, implying that the starbursts occur in
multiple short bursts. The data hint at a delay of 50--100Myr between the onset
of star formation and subsequent fuelling of the black hole. We discuss whether
this may be a consequence of the role that stellar ejecta could play in
fuelling the black hole. While a significant mass is ejected by OB winds and
supernovae, their high velocity means that very little of it can be accreted.
On the other hand winds from AGB stars ultimately dominate the total mass loss,
and they can also be accreted very efficiently because of their slow speeds.

AGNs and the formation of stars are the most important processes in the formation of galaxies and provide the necessary background for theoretical models of evolution. The results show that the star formation in the AGNs is greatly influenced by the energy of the AGNs and the mass of the gas; whereas in AGN-dominated systems, compared with the un-stars, a significant role for AGNs plays a significant role in the formation of stars.

introduced by Andradas, Recio and Sendra, under the name of hypercircles, as an
algorithmic cornerstone tool in the context of improving the rational
parametrization (simplifying the coefficients of the rational functions, when
possible) of algebraic varieties. A real circle can be defined as the image of
the real axis under a Moebius transformation in the complex field. Likewise,
and roughly speaking, a hypercircle can be defined as the image of a line (""the
${\mathbb{K}}$-axis"") in a $n$-degree finite algebraic extension
$\mathbb{K}(\alpha)\thickapprox\mathbb{K}^n$ under the transformation
$\frac{at+b}{ct+d}:\mathbb{K}(\alpha)\to\mathbb{K}(\alpha)$.
  The aim of this article is to extend, to the case of hypercircles, some of
the specific properties of circles. We show that hypercircles are precisely,
via $\mathbb{K}$-projective transformations, the rational normal curve of a
suitable degree. We also obtain a complete description of the points at
infinity of these curves (generalizing the cyclic structure at infinity of
circles). We characterize hypercircles as those curves of degree equal to the
dimension of the ambient affine space and with infinitely many
${\mathbb{K}}$-rational points, passing through these points at infinity.
Moreover, we give explicit formulae for the parametrization and implicitation
of hypercircles. Besides the intrinsic interest of this very special family of
curves, the understanding of its properties has a direct application to the
simplification of parametrizations problem, as shown in the last section.

Our main motivation for this work lies in the lack of an acme of the geometry of certain shapes in Euclidean space. The geometry of the circle in the algebraic space is not fully known. Our study will give a more complete picture of the geometric properties of circles in algebraic spaces.

extension, from the very central regions up to the tidal radius. In the present
paper such a data set is used to study the BSS population and its radial
distribution. A total number of 39 bright ($m_{218}\le 19.5$) BSS has been
detected, and they have been found to be highly segregated in the cluster core.
No significant upturn in the BSS frequency has been observed in the outskirts
of NGC 1904, in contrast to other clusters (M 3, 47 Tuc, NGC 6752, M 5) studied
with the same technique. Such evidences, coupled with the large radius of
avoidance estimated for NGC 1904 ($r_{avoid}\sim 30$ core radii), indicate that
the vast majority of the cluster heavy stars (binaries) has already sunk to the
core. Accordingly, extensive dynamical simulations suggest that BSS formed by
mass transfer activity in primordial binaries evolving in isolation in the
cluster outskirts represent only a negligible (0--10%) fraction of the overall
population.

phase transition in those finite nuclear systems. Some results suggest that the
observable Z1 (charge of the biggest fragment) can be considered as a reliable
order parameter of the transition. This talk will show how from peripheral

the canonical description of a phase transition to link this bimodal behaviour
with the residual convexity of the entropy. Theoretical (with and without phase
transition) and experimental Z1-E* correlations are compared. This comparison
allows us to rule out the case without transition. Moreover that quantitative
comparison provides us with information about the coexistence region in the

abnormal uctuations of configurational energy (microcanonical negative heat

for their triaxiality. Assuming that the triaxial shapes of galaxy clusters are
induced by the tidal interaction with the surrounding matter, Lee and Kang
recently developed a reconstruction algorithm for the measurement of the axial
ratio of a triaxial cluster. We examine the validity of this reconstruction
algorithm by performing an observational test of it with the Virgo cluster as a
target. We first modify the LK06 algorithm by incorporating the two dimensional
projection effect. Then, we analyze the 1275 member galaxies from the Virgo
Cluster Catalogue and find the projected direction of the Virgo cluster major
axis by measuring the anisotropy in the spatial distribution of the member
galaxies in the two dimensional projected plane. Applying the modified
reconstruction algorithm to the analyzed data, we find that the axial ratio of
the triaxial Virgo cluster is (1: 0.54 : 0.73). This result is consistent with
the recent observational report from the Virgo Cluster Survey, proving the
robustness of the reconstruction algorithm. It is also found that at the inner
radii the shape tends to be more like prolate. We discuss the possible effect
of the Virgo cluster triaxiality on the mass estimation.
","Our findings show that the Virgo cluster is triaxial, and the axis is in a preferred position, with a vertical and a horizontal line of the Local Group, and the two axes are perpendicular and inclined, respectively. This axis, which is not a spherical one, suggests a significant anisotropy of the gravitational field, which may have important consequences for the formation and evolution of the Virgo cluster. The research was conducted with the purpose of understanding the formation and evolution of this complex spherical system, which was then examined in a variety of galaxies, with the aim of bringing together the complex physical and formation histories of the Virgo Cluster, and to make the connection between the virgo cluster and the Virgo, which encompasses more than a thousand galaxies. The Virgo Cluster is triaxial, with the preference for the direction of the Local Group. The longest axis is aligned roughly to the line of sight, while the intermediate and shortest axis are inclined and perpendicular.

Al-Mn-Pd single crystals in ultrahigh vacuum and have investigated the cleavage
planes in-situ by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Globular patterns in the
STM-images were interpreted as clusters of atoms. These are significant
structural units of quasicrystals. The experiments of Ebert et al. imply that
they are also stable physical entities, a property controversially discussed
currently. For a clarification we performed the first large scale fracture
simulations on three-dimensional complex binary systems. We studied the
propagation of mode I cracks in an icosahedral model quasicrystal by molecular
dynamics techniques at low temperature. In particular we examined how the shape
of the cleavage plane is influenced by the clusters inherent in the model and
how it depends on the plane structure. Brittle fracture with no indication of
dislocation activity is observed. The crack surfaces are rough on the scale of
the clusters, but exhibit constant average heights for orientations
perpendicular to high symmetry axes. From detailed analyses of the fractured
samples we conclude that both, the plane structure and the clusters, strongly
influence dynamic fracture in quasicrystals and that the clusters therefore
have to be regarded as physical entities.
","It was found that the failure of the icosahedral quasicrystals was the result of the breaking of the 12-fold symmetry bonds. This was the result of the localization of shear stress at the places of the break and initiation of cracks. Our results indicated that the kinetics of the cracking were not confined to the normal region, but to the site of the cracks which were formed. It was observed that, at higher temperatures, the energy dissipation mechanisms, the dislocation nucleation and the motion of the crack, dominated, whereas at higher temperatures, the crack nucleation and the motion of the crack, induced the more severe cracks. This study showed that the kinetics of the cracking was dependent on the geometry of the quasicrystals, which played a major role in the fracture pattern. It was interesting to observe that, with the increase of temperature, the elasticity of the crack increased.

for the ICARUS-T60o, and is focused on the following activities, for which we
seek an extended international collaboration:
  (1) the neutrino beam from the CERN 400 GeV proton beam and an optimised horn
focussing, eventually with an increased intensity in the framework of the LHC
accelerator improvement program;
  (2) A new experimental area LNGS-B, of at least 50000 m3 at 10 km off-axis
from the main Laboratory, eventually upgradable to larger sizes. A location is
under consideration at about 1.2 km equivalent water depth;
  (3) A new LAr Imaging detector of at least 20 kt fiducial mass. Such an
increase in the volume over the current ICARUS T600 needs to be carefully

primordial or collisional binary systems. In the context of dwarf spheroidal
galaxies it is hard to firmly disentangle a genuine BSS population from young
main sequence (MS) stars tracing a ~1-2 Gyr old star forming episode. Assuming
that their blue plume populations are made of BSS, we estimate the BSS
frequency for 8 Local Group non star-forming dwarf galaxies, using a
compilation of ground and space based photometry.
  Our results can be summarized as follows: (i) The BSS frequency in dwarf
galaxies, at any given Mv, is always higher than that in globular clusters of
similar luminosities; (ii) the BSS frequency for the lowest luminosity dwarf
galaxies is in excellent agreement with that observed in the Milky Way halo;
and most interestingly (iii) derive a statistically significant
anti-correlation between the BSS frequency and the galaxy Mv.
  The low density, almost collision-less, environments of our dwarf galaxy
sample allow us to infer (i) their very low dynamical evolution; (ii) a
negligible production of collisional BSS; and consequently (iii) that their
blue plumes are mainly made of primordial binaries. The dwarf galaxies
anti-correlation can be used as a discriminator: galaxies obeying the
anti-correlation are more likely to possess genuine primordial BSS rather than
young main sequence stars.
","The study thus obtained is a new view of the formation of starry galaxies and their stellar populations, and in addition it has a beneficial effect on the development of galaxies in general. This study has the aim of bringing about a better understanding of the evolution of the galaxies and the formation of their stellar populations. The main purpose of this work is to study the blue plume population in the dwarf galaxies in order to establish if this population is actually the blue plume, or if it is simply a young, young population. The blue plume population of the dwarf galaxies is measured using photometric and spectroscopic data obtained from both the ground and the space telescopes. Then we compare the blue plume population to the theoretical models for the blue plume and the young galaxies to determine the most likely scenario.

anisotropic nearest-neighbour exchange couplings on the kagome net, i.e. with
coupling J in one lattice direction and couplings J' along the other two
directions. For J/J' > 1, this model is believed to describe the magnetic
properties of the mineral volborthite. In the classical limit, it exhibits two
kinds of ground states: a ferrimagnetic state for J/J' < 1/2 and a large
manifold of canted spin states for J/J' > 1/2. To include quantum effects
self-consistently, we investigate the Sp(N) symmetric generalisation of the
original SU(2) symmetric model in the large-N limit. In addition to the
dependence on the anisotropy, the Sp(N) symmetric model depends on a parameter
kappa that measures the importance of quantum effects. Our numerical
calculations reveal that in the kappa-J/J' plane, the system shows a rich phase
diagram containing a ferrimagnetic phase, an incommensurate phase, and a
decoupled chain phase, the latter two with short- and long-range order. We
corroborate these results by showing that the boundaries between the various
phases and several other features of the Sp(N) phase diagram can be determined
by analytical calculations. Finally, the application of a block-spin
perturbation expansion to the trimerised version of the original spin-1/2 model
leads us to suggest that in the limit of strong anisotropy, J/J' >> 1, the
ground state of the original model is a collinearly ordered antiferromagnet,
which is separated from the incommensurate state by a quantum phase transition.

singularity at the Fermi momentum $k_F$. The Fourier spectrum of the density
has a step-like form at the wavevector $2k_F$, with the harmonics being absent
or vanishing above this threshold. These features are found by calculations
using exact diagonalization method. They are shown to be caused by Wigner
ordering of electrons, affected by the boundaries. However the common Luttinger
liquid model with open boundaries fails to capture these features, because it
overestimates the deformation of the Wigner crystal. An improvement of the
Luttinger liquid model is proposed which allows one to describe the above
features correctly. It is based on the corrected form of the density operator

intrinsic spin of matter. Since the spins of fermions are normally randomly
oriented in macroscopic bodies, the torsion generated is normally negligible.
However, in a recent paper, Mao et al. point out that there is a class of
theories in which the angular momentum of macroscopic spinning bodies generates
a significant amount of torsion. They argue that by the principle of action
equals reaction, one would expect the angular momentum of test bodies to couple
to a background torsion field, and therefore the precession of the GPB
gyroscopes should be affected in these theories by the torsion generated by the
Earth. We show that in fact the principle of action equals reaction does not
apply to these theories. We examine in detail a generalization of the
Hayashi-Shirafuji theory suggested by Mao et al. called
Einstein-Hayashi-Shirafuji theory. There are a variety of different versions of
this theory, depending on the precise form of the coupling to matter chosen for
the torsion. We show that for any coupling to matter that is compatible with
the spin transport equation postulated by Mao et al., the theory has either
ghosts or an ill-posed initial value formulation. These theoretical problems
can be avoided by specializing the parameters of the theory and in addition
choosing the standard minimal coupling to matter of the torsion tensor. This
yields a consistent theory, but one in which the action equals reaction
principle is violated, and in which the angular momentum of the gyroscopes does
not couple to the Earth's torsion field. Thus, the Einstein-Hayashi-Shirafuji
theory does not predict a detectable torsion signal for Gravity Probe B. There
may be other torsion theories which do.
","The GP-B mission, which consists of the GP-B gyroscope, makes a change in the gyroscope rotation and the background torsion field, which affects the precession of the GP-B gyroscope, and hence alters the expected precession rate.

Belinsky-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz-type chaotic behaviour is found, for many
Einstein-matter models (notably those related to the low-energy limit of
superstring theory and M-theory), to be connected with certain
(infinite-dimensional) hyperbolic Kac-Moody algebras. In particular, the
billiard chambers describing the asymptotic cosmological behaviour of pure
Einstein gravity in spacetime dimension d+1, or the metric-three-form system of
11-dimensional supergravity, are found to be identical to the Weyl chambers of
the Lorentzian Kac-Moody algebras AE_d, or E_{10}, respectively. This suggests
that these Kac-Moody algebras are hidden symmetries of the corresponding

is a few hundred times higher than that expected for a high-mass X-ray binary
in the cluster center, but is consistent with the expected value for accretion
onto an IMBH with the reported mass. A pulsar wind nebula is also a possible
candidate for the radio and X-ray emission from G1; future high-sensitivity
VLBI observations might distinguish between this possibility and an IMBH. If
the radio source is an IMBH, and similar accretion and outflow processes occur

used in Fan and Li (2001, 2002, 2004) which are reminiscent of the well-known
pitfalls related to Hodges' estimator. The oracle property is often a
consequence of sparsity of an estimator. We show that any estimator satisfying
a sparsity property has maximal risk that converges to the supremum of the loss
function; in particular, the maximal risk diverges to infinity whenever the
loss function is unbounded. For ease of presentation the result is set in the
framework of a linear regression model, but generalizes far beyond that
setting. In a Monte Carlo study we also assess the extent of the problem in
finite samples for the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) estimator
introduced in Fan and Li (2001). We find that this estimator can perform rather
poorly in finite samples and that its worst-case performance relative to
maximum likelihood deteriorates with increasing sample size when the estimator
is tuned to sparsity.
","We will use a simulation and a real-world dataset to test the effectiveness of sparse estimators. This is a unified approach and is based on the idea of comparing sparse estimators with the oracle property. The oracle property is the basic property of most sparse estimators and is able to give unbiased estimates and low variances when the number of irrelevant variables is small. The results of this research will be of use in various fields, such as machine learning, statistical inference, and bioinformatics. The main idea of this research is to examine the effectiveness of sparse estimators in high-dimensional problems, where the number of covariates is much greater than the number of observations. We propose an approach to study the effectiveness of sparse estimators in high-dimensional problems, where the number of covariates is far greater than the number of observations.

wall-isotropic fluid interface. When the fluid is confined between two hard
walls, capillary columnar ordering occurs via a first-order phase transition.
For higher chemical potentials the system exhibits layering transitions even
for very narrow slits (near the one-dimensional limit). The theoretical model
used was a density-functional theory based on the Fundamental-Measure
Functional applied to a fluid of hard rectangles in the restricted-orientation
approximation (Zwanzig model). The results presented here can be checked
experimentally in two-dimensional granular media made of rods, where vertical
motions induced by an external source and excluded volume interactions between
the grains allow the system to explore those stationary states which
entropically maximize packing configurations. We claim that some of the surface
phenomena found here can be present in two-dimensional granular-media fluids.

certain constant of integration taking a value greater than around 10^5 in
units of the d = 11 gravitational length, a form of thick pipe geometry is
found that realizes TeV-scale gravity by the ADD mechanism, with that boundary
becoming the inner surface of the thick pipe, where we live. Three alternative
ways in which the outer surface of the thick pipe might be stabilized
consistent with the observed value of the effective d = 4 cosmological constant
are considered. In the first alternative, the outer surface is stabilized in
the classical region and the constant of integration is fixed at around 10^{13}
in units of the d = 11 gravitational length for consistency with the observed
cosmological constant. In the second alternative, the four observed dimensions
have reduced in size down to the d = 11 gravitational length at the outer

co-spatial with H\alpha emission previously observed in the outer ring of UGC
6614. The estimated dust-to-gas ratios, from less than 10^{-3} to 10^{-2},
support previous indications that the LSB galaxies are relatively dust poor
compared to the HSB galaxies. The total infrared luminosities are approximately
1/3 to 1/2 the blue band luminosities, suggesting that old stellar populations
are the primary source of dust heating in these LSB objects. The SFR estimated
from the infrared data ranges ~0.01-0.88 M_sun yr^{-1}, consistent with results
from optical studies.
","I would like to introduce new knowledge about the properties of the galaxy, which might help us to understand the origin of the universe and how it was created.

In this study, I am attempting to understand the formation and evolution of these galaxies on a global scale. Moreover, these galaxies are unique because they are so large and so small, which is difficult to observe with traditional methods. In this study, I am employing NASA's Wide-field Infrared Explorer, which is a telescope of the WISE program, I will study the infrared properties of these galaxies. I will investigate the properties of these galaxies in the infrared, and thus, at last, we will understand the mysteries of the universe and how it has been created.

calculations of pseudoscalar and heavy-light mesonic quantities, those entering
staggered calculations of baryonic quantities have not been quantified. Here I
develop staggered chiral perturbation theory in the light-quark baryon sector
by mapping the Symanzik action into heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory.
For 2+1 dynamical quark flavors, the masses of flavor-symmetric nucleons are
calculated to third order in partially quenched and fully dynamical staggered
chiral perturbation theory. To this order the expansion includes the leading
chiral logarithms, which come from loops with virtual decuplet-like states, as
well as terms the order of the cubed pion mass, which come from loops with
virtual octet-like states. Taste violations enter through the meson propagators
in loops and tree-level terms the order of the squared lattice spacing. The
pattern of taste symmetry breaking and the resulting degeneracies and mixings
are discussed in detail. The resulting chiral forms are appropriate to lattice
results obtained with operators already in use and could be used to study the
restoration of taste symmetry in the continuum limit. I assume that the fourth
root of the fermion determinant can be incorporated in staggered chiral
perturbation theory using the replica method.
","The results demonstrate that the structure of the framework is a powerful one, and it is able to account for the results of the experiments that are being carried out. The concept of a stable chiral curve for the calculation of heavy particles is well known. Its main features are that it combines chiral extrapolation with non-relativistic QCD, which is necessary for analyzing heavy particles. In this study, we will present a comparison of the results of these two experiments with a test of the same idea. We introduce the chiral curve and use the chiral equivalence for the analysis of heavy particles. This method of calculation is based on the chiral extrapolation of the chiral superfluous particles, which are of much higher mass than the  of PT. In this method, we can compare the equivalence of the two, and the renormalization of some parameters. The method combines the chiral expansion and the non-relativistic QCD to study the low-energy regime of baryons. This approach is useful for analyzing modern experiments and forming a theoretical basis for future studies.

using a sample of Ap and Bp stars with accurate Hipparcos parallaxes and
definitely determined longitudinal magnetic fields. We confirm our previous
results obtained from the study of Ap and Bp stars with accurate measurements
of the mean magnetic field modulus and mean quadratic magnetic fields that
magnetic stars of mass M < 3 M_sun are concentrated towards the centre of the
main-sequence band. In contrast, stars with masses M > 3 M_sun seem to be
concentrated closer to the ZAMS. The study of a few known members of nearby
open clusters with accurate Hipparcos parallaxes confirms these conclusions.
Stronger magnetic fields tend to be found in hotter, younger and more massive
stars, as well as in stars with shorter rotation periods. No evidence is found
for any loss of angular momentum during the main-sequence life. The magnetic
flux remains constant over the stellar life time on the main sequence. An
excess of stars with large obliquities beta is detected in both higher and
lower mass stars. The obliquity angle distribution as inferred from the
distribution of r-values appears random at the time magnetic stars become
observable on the H-R diagram. After quite a short time spent on the main
sequence, the obliquity angle beta tends to reach values close to either 90 deg
or 0 deg for M < 3 M_sun. The evolution of the obliquity angle beta seems to be
somewhat different for low and high mass stars. While we find a strong hint for
an increase of beta with the elapsed time on the main sequence for stars with M
> 3 M_sun, no similar trend is found for stars with M < 3 M_sun. However, the
predominance of high values of beta at advanced ages in these stars is notable.

We found that most of the stars in our study were dipole-like, which was the case in the youngest and less massive stars. However, more massive stars were more complex and non-axisymmetric. Our results indicate that the distribution of the magnetic field varies significantly with age and mass.

invariants of knots and 3-manifolds"", math.GT/0406190, essentially: ""Can one
describe the category of representations of the quantum group U_q(sl_n)
(thought of as a spherical category) via generators and relations?""
  For each n \geq 0, I define a certain tensor category of trivalent graphs,
modulo isotopy, and construct a functor from this category onto (a full
subcategory of) the category of representations of the quantum group U_q(sl_n).
One would like to describe completely the kernel of this functor, by providing
generators. The resulting quotient of the diagrammatic category would then be a
category equivalent to the representation category of U_q(sl_n).
  I make significant progress towards this, describing certain generators of
the kernel, and some obstructions to further elements. It remains a conjecture
that these relations generate the kernel. My results extend those of
q-alg/9712003, MR1659228, math.QA/0310143 and math.GT/0506403.
  The argument is essentially by constructing a diagrammatic version of the
forgetful functor coming from the inclusion of U_q(sl_{n-1}) in U_q(sl_n}. We
know this functor is faithful, so a diagram is in the kernel for n exactly if
its image under the diagrammatic forgetful functor is in the kernel for n-1.
This allows us to perform inductive calculations, both establishing families of
elements of the kernel, and finding obstructions.

The results of this study are: the re-construction of a hierarchical representation of the tensors of U-q-sl-n, and new methods for studying the representation of tensors in the field of mathematical physics. This category, which we are going to introduce, is a diagrammatic representation of the tensors of U-q-sl-n.

pc away from the sun, taken in the F435W, F606W, and F814W bands. Scattered
light is detected up to 14'' from the star. The observations are consistent
with the presence of an extended flattened nebula with the same inclination as
the inner disk. The well-known ``spiral arms'' are clearly observed and they
trail the rotating disk material. Weaker arms never before reported are also
seen. The inter-arm space becomes brighter, but the structures become more
neutral in color at longer wavelengths, which is not consistent with models
that assume that they are due to the effects of a warped disk. Along the major
disk axis, the colors of the scattered-light relative to the star are \Delta
(F435W-F606W) ~ 0.0--0.2 mags and \Delta (F435W-F814W)~0.5--1 mags. To explain
these colors, we explore the role of asymmetric scattering, reddening, and
large minimum sizes on ISM-like grains. We conclude each of these hypotheses by
itself cannot explain the colors. The disk colors are similar to those derived
for Kuiper Belt objects, suggesting that the same processes responsible for
their colors may be at work here. We argue that we are observing only the
geometrically thick, optically thin envelope of the disk, while the optically
thick disk responsible for the far-IR emission is undetected. The observed
spiral arms are then structures on this envelope. The colors indicate that the
extended nebulosity is not a remnant of the infalling envelope but reprocessed
disk material.

The dusty star HD 100546 is a disc, which is known to have its grains growing and changing with the wind, and is thus a unique laboratory for the study of the inner structure of the star. The structure of the star is consistent with the presence of a giant planet, which in turn injects sufficient energy to open the gap and create the inner ring, through Rossby vortices. We can see a very bright inner ring, which corresponds to the radiance of the spectra of the light, and to the light scattered by the dust.

mechanism to generate mass for a bosonic p-tensor field in any spacetime

3+1 dimensional Cremmer-Scherk actions as particular cases. Within the
Hamiltonian formulation, the embedded topological field theory (TFT) sector
related to the topological mass term is not manifest in the original phase
space. However through an appropriate canonical transformation, a gauge
invariant factorisation of phase space into two orthogonal sectors is feasible.
The first of these sectors includes canonically conjugate gauge invariant
variables with free massive excitations. The second sector, which decouples
from the total Hamiltonian, is equivalent to the phase space description of the
associated non dynamical pure TFT. Within canonical quantisation, a likewise
factorisation of quantum states thus arises for the full spectrum of TMGT in
any dimension. This new factorisation scheme also enables a definition of the
usual projection from TMGT onto topological quantum field theories in a most
natural and transparent way. None of these results rely on any gauge fixing

resulting line profiles are most sensitive to the inclination angle. We have

conversion of originally amorphous dust into minerals. We find strong evidence
of evolution of the dust crystalline mass fraction in parallel with that of the
structure of the disks, in the sense that increasing crystalline mass fraction
is strongly linked to dust settling to the disk midplane. We also confirm that
the crystalline silicates are confined to small radii, r < 10 AU. However, we
see no significant correlation of crystalline mass fraction with stellar mass
or luminosity, stellar accretion rate, disk mass, or disk/star mass ratio, as
would be expected in the standard models of dust processing based upon
photo-evaporation and condensation close to the central star,
accretion-heating-driven annealing at r < 1 AU, or spiral-shock heating at r <
10 AU, with or without effective radial mixing mechanisms. Either another
grain-crystallizing mechanism dominates over these, or another process must be
at work within the disks to erase the correlations they produce. We propose one
of each sort that seem to be worth further investigation, namely X-ray heating
and annealing of dust grains, and modulation of disk structure by
giant-planetary formation and migration.

more realistic viscosity and sound-speed prescriptions than previous work to
examine the eccentric instability which underlies the superhump phenomenon in
semi-detached binaries. We illustrate the importance of the two-armed spiral
mode in the generation of superhumps. Differential motions in the fluid disc
cause converging flows which lead to strong spiral shocks once each superhump
cycle. The dissipation associated with these shocks powers the superhump. We
compare 2D and 3D results, and conclude that 3D simulations are necessary to
faithfully simulate the disc dynamics. We ran our simulations for unprecedented
durations, so that an eccentric equilibrium is established except at high mass
ratios where the growth rate of the instability is very low. Our improved
simulations give a closer match to the observed relationship between superhump
period excess and binary mass ratio than previous numerical work. The observed
black hole X-ray transient superhumpers appear to have systematically lower
disc precession rates than the cataclysmic variables. This could be due to
higher disc temperatures and thicknesses. The modulation in total viscous
dissipation on the superhump period is overwhelmingly from the region of the
disc within the 3:1 resonance radius. As the eccentric instability develops,
the viscous torques are enhanced, and the disc consequently adjusts to a new
equilibrium state, as suggested in the thermal-tidal instability model. We
quantify this enhancement in the viscosity, which is ~10 per cent for q=0.08.
We characterise the eccentricity distributions in our accretion discs, and show

hierarchical clustering of nonlinear structures in the universe. These shocks
govern the nature of cosmic plasma through thermalization of gas and
acceleration of nonthermal, cosmic-ray (CR) particles. We study the statistics
and energetics of shocks formed in cosmological simulations of a concordance
$\Lambda$CDM universe, with a special emphasis on the effects of
non-gravitational processes such as radiative cooling, photoionization/heating,
and galactic superwind feedbacks. Adopting an improved model for gas
thermalization and CR acceleration efficiencies based on nonlinear diffusive
shock acceleration calculations, we then estimate the gas thermal energy and
the CR energy dissipated at shocks through the history of the universe. Since
shocks can serve as sites for generation of vorticity, we also examine the
vorticity that should have been generated mostly at curved shocks in
cosmological simulations. We find that the dynamics and energetics of shocks
are governed primarily by the gravity of matter, so other non-gravitational
processes do not affect significantly the global energy dissipation and
vorticity generation at cosmological shocks. Our results reinforce scenarios in
which the intracluster medium and warm-hot intergalactic medium contain
energetically significant populations of nonthermal particles and turbulent
flow motions.
","The study is based on the fact that shock waves are crucial in the distribution of matter in the universe, but have so far not been studied extensively. This study is of a critical nature, since the shock waves are indispensable in the distribution of matter in the universe, but their non-gravitational effects have not been well studied. We show that shock waves have a substantial effect on the distribution of the gas, but not on gravity. Our results indicate that shock waves have a substantial effect on the distribution of the gas, and that in general, shock waves tend to warm the gas particles and to compress the gas; they increase the density and temperature of the gas, and increase the speed of the gas particles. In our analysis, we are studying the effects of cosmological shock waves on the structure of the universe. We believe that these shock waves are very important for the distribution of the mass of matter in the universe, but they have not been thoroughly studied.

interaction is incorporated through the solution of the Lippmann Schwinger
equation using an elastic scattering matrix element, $T_{\eta d \to \eta d}$,
which is required to be half off-shell. It is written in a factorized form,
with an off-shell form factor multiplying an on-shell part given by an
effective range expansion up to the fourth power in momentum. The parameters of
this expansion have been taken from an existing recent relativistic Faddeev
equation solution for the $\eta NN$ system corresponding to different $\eta-N$

two fundamental quantum phenomena in solids: in three dimensions it can turn a
metal into a superconductor whereas in one dimension it can turn a metal into
an insulator. In two dimensions (2D) both superconductivity and charge-density
waves (CDW) are believed to be anomalous. In superconducting cuprates, critical
transition temperatures are unusually high and the energy gap may stay unclosed
even above these temperatures (pseudogap). In CDW-bearing dichalcogenides the
resistivity below the transition can decrease with temperature even faster than
in the normal phase and a basic prerequisite for the CDW, the favourable
nesting conditions (when some sections of the Fermi surface appear shifted by
the same vector), seems to be absent. Notwithstanding the existence of
alternatives to conventional theories, both phenomena in 2D still remain the
most fascinating puzzles in condensed matter physics. Using the latest
developments in high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES) here we show that the normal-state pseudogap also exists in one of the
most studied 2D examples, dichalcogenide 2H-TaSe2, and the formation of CDW is
driven by a conventional nesting instability, which is masked by the pseudogap.
Our findings reconcile and explain a number of unusual, as previously believed,
experimental responses as well as disprove many alternative theoretical
approaches. The magnitude, character and anisotropy of the 2D-CDW pseudogap are
intriguingly similar to those seen in superconducting cuprates.

agreement with the decreasing fraction of absorbed AGNs as a function of

cosmological model. We use the combined GALFORM semi-analytical galaxy
formation model and GRASIL spectrophotometric code to compute galaxy SEDs
including the reprocessing of radiation by dust. The model, which is the same
as that in Baugh et al (2005), assumes two different IMFs: a normal solar
neighbourhood IMF for quiescent star formation in disks, and a very top-heavy
IMF in starbursts triggered by galaxy mergers. We have shown previously that
the top-heavy IMF seems to be necessary to explain the number counts of faint
sub-mm galaxies. We compare the model with observational data from the SPITZER
Space Telescope, with the model parameters fixed at values chosen before
SPITZER data became available. We find that the model matches the observed
evolution in the IR remarkably well over the whole range of wavelengths probed
by SPITZER. In particular, the SPITZER data show that there is strong evolution
in the mid-IR galaxy luminosity function over the redshift range z ~ 0-2, and
this is reproduced by our model without requiring any adjustment of parameters.
On the other hand, a model with a normal IMF in starbursts predicts far too
little evolution in the mid-IR luminosity function, and is therefore excluded.
","We present the hierarchical model of galaxy formation. It is based on the merger history of a dark matter halos, and its origins in the universe. It is based on the kinetic theory of the gas phase of galaxies and the feedback of supernovae and black holes. The hierarchical model consists of a gas-phase model, which contains the atmosphere, star formation and the chemical content of the star, which are crucial for their evolution over time. In our study, we study the genesis and evolution of galaxies in the universe, which is an important and difficult problem for astronomy. We study the formation and evolution of galaxies in the universe, incorporating the effects of gas dynamics, star formation, and the feedback of supernovae and black holes. The hierarchical model is based on the merger history of the dark matter halos, which are assumed to be the hosts of galaxies, and combines the synthesis of the star formation, the synthesis of the dust, and the chemical composition of galaxies. This study reveals important information about the evolution of galaxies in the universe and suggests the need for more sophisticated models, combining the complexity of the astrophysics of the universe.

prominence oscillations is that they are damped in time and that the values of
the damping times are usually between one and three times the corresponding
oscillatory period. However, the mechanism responsible for the attenuation is
still not well-known. Aims. Thermal conduction, optically thin or thick
radiation and heating are taken into account in the energy equation, and their
role on the attenuation of prominence oscillations is evaluated. Methods. The
dispersion relation for linear non-adiabatic magnetoacoustic waves is derived
considering an equilibrium made of a prominence plasma slab embedded in an
unbounded corona. The magnetic field is orientated along the direction parallel
to the slab axis and has the same strength in all regions. By solving the
dispersion relation for a fixed wavenumber, a complex oscillatory frequency is
obtained, and the period and the damping time are computed. Results. The effect
of conduction and radiation losses is different for each magnetoacoustic mode
and depends on the wavenumber. In the observed range of wavelengths the
internal slow mode is attenuated by radiation from the prominence plasma, the
fast mode by the combination of prominence radiation and coronal conduction and
the external slow mode by coronal conduction. The consideration of the external
corona is of paramount importance in the case of the fast and external slow
modes, whereas it does not affect the internal slow modes at all. Conclusions.
Non-adiabatic effects are efficient damping mechanisms for magnetoacoustic
modes, and the values of the obtained damping times are compatible with those
observed.

Moreover, boolean circuits have a representation in terms of elements of a

calculated from only the spectroscopic orbit of its parent star and the
analysis of its transit light curve. This does not require additional
constraints, such as are often inferred from theoretical stellar models or
model atmospheres. The planet's surface gravity can therefore be measured
precisely and from only directly observable quantities. We outline the method
and apply it to the case of the first known transiting extrasolar planet, HD
209458b. We find a surface gravity of g_p = 9.28 +/- 0.15 m/s, which is an
order of magnitude more precise than the best available measurements of its
mass, radius and density. This confirms that the planet has a much lower
surface gravity that that predicted by published theoretical models of gas
giant planets. We apply our method to all fourteen known transiting extrasolar
planets and find a significant correlation between surface gravity and orbital
period, which is related to the known correlation between mass and period. This
correlation may be the underlying effect as surface gravity is a fundamental
parameter in the evaporation of planetary atmospheres.

clusters based on HST and high resolution ground-based imaging. The catalog
contains precise cluster positions (RA and Dec), magnitudes and colors in the
UBVRIJHKs filters, metallicities, radial velocities, masses and ages, where
available, and galactocentric distances for each cluster. The color
distribution of the M33 clusters appears to be similar to those in the Large
Magellanic Cloud with major peaks at (B-V)o~0.15, and (B-V)o~0.65. The
intrinsic colors are correlated with cluster ages, which range from 10^{7.5} to
10^{10.3} years. The age distribution of the star clusters supports the notion
of rapid cluster disruption with a slope of alpha=-1.09 +/- 0.07 in the
dN_{cluster}/dt ~ t^{alpha} relation. In addition, comparison to theoretical
single stellar population models suggests the presence of an age-metallicity
relation among these clusters with younger clusters being more metal-rich.
Analysis of the radial distribution of the clusters yields some evidence that
younger clusters (age <~ 1 Gyr) may be more concentrated toward the center of
M33 than older ones. A similar comparison with the radial profile of the M33
field stars shows the clusters to be more centrally concentrated at the greater
than 99.9% confidence level. Possible reasons for this are presented and
discussed; however, the overwhelming conclusion seems to be that a more
complete and thorough cluster search is needed covering at least 4 square
degrees centered on M33.

two families according to their $u-r$ colours. The total sample consists of
10865 galaxies. As expected, the highest fraction of galaxies (62%) turned to
be early-type (red) ones, being located at smaller distances from the cluster
centre and showing lower velocity dispersions than late-type (blue) ones. The
brightest cluster galaxies are located in the innermost regions and show the
smallest velocity dispersions. Early-type galaxies also show constant velocity
dispersion profiles inside the virial radius and a mild decline in the
outermost regions. In contrast, late-type galaxies show always decreasing
velocity dispersions profiles. No correlation has been found between the
fraction of blue galaxies and cluster global properties, such as cluster
velocity dispersion and galaxy concentration. In contrast, we found correlation
between the X-ray luminosity and the fraction of blue galaxies. These results
indicate that early- and late-type galaxies may have had different evolution.
Thus, blue galaxies are located in more anisotropic and radial orbits than
early-type ones. Their star formation seems to be independent of the cluster
global properties in low mass clusters, but not for the most massive ones.
These observational results suggest that the global environment could be
important for driving the evolution of galaxies in the most massive cluster
($\sigma > 800$ km s$^{-1}$). However, the local environment could play a key
role in galaxy evolution for low mass clusters.

here refers to the combined procedure resulting from first selecting a model
(e.g., by a model selection criterion like AIC or by a hypothesis testing
procedure) and then estimating the parameters in the selected model (e.g., by
least-squares or maximum likelihood), all based on the same data set. We show
that it is impossible to estimate the unconditional distribution with
reasonable accuracy even asymptotically. In particular, we show that no
estimator for this distribution can be uniformly consistent (not even locally).
This follows as a corollary to (local) minimax lower bounds on the performance
of estimators for the distribution; performance is here measured by the
probability that the estimation error exceeds a given threshold. These lower
bounds are shown to approach 1/2 or even 1 in large samples, depending on the
situation considered. Similar impossibility results are also obtained for the
distribution of linear functions (e.g., predictors) of the post-model-selection
estimator.

Post-model-selection estimators have become more popular, and the selection of models is often influenced by biases. However, the selection of models is biased and this bias is often ignored. The present method can be used to estimate the absolute distribution of the estimator using an empirical characteristic function.

iron line equivalent width (EW) and the underlying power law index (Gamma). The
data reveal a correlation between Gamma and EW which turns over at Gamma <~ 2,
but finds a weak anti-correlation for steeper photon indices. We propose that
this relationship is driven by dilution of a disk spectrum (which includes the
narrow iron line) by a beamed jet component and, hence, could be used as a
diagnostic of jet-dominance. In addition, our sample shows a strong correlation
between the reflection fraction (R) and Gamma, but we find that it is likely

anti-correlation between the 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity and EW) for the sample

right-handed neutrino in type II seesaw scenarios, taking into account
flavour-dependent effects. In the type II seesaw mechanism, in addition to the
type I seesaw contribution, an additional direct mass term for the light
neutrinos is present. We consider type II seesaw scenarios where this
additional contribution arises from the vacuum expectation value of a Higgs
triplet, and furthermore an effective model-independent approach. We
investigate bounds on the flavour-specific decay asymmetries, on the mass of
the lightest right-handed neutrino and on the reheat temperature of the early
universe, and compare them to the corresponding bounds in the type I seesaw
framework. We show that while flavour-dependent thermal type II leptogenesis
becomes more efficient for larger mass scale of the light neutrinos, and the
bounds become relaxed, the type I seesaw scenario for leptogenesis becomes more
constrained. We also argue that in general, flavour-dependent effects cannot be
ignored when dealing with leptogenesis in type II seesaw models.
","The study was based on the general unified theory of the So-called ""Great Unity"" (SO-108) (i.e., the 'Siberia) (the so-called ""seberia"") cosmology. In the world of this asymmetry, which is a very complex puzzle, is very important. Hence, it is necessary to understand the origin of the asymmetry. In the future, we will be able to discover how the asymmetry in the Universe is derived from the asymmetry in the Yukawa. Moreover, we are able to examine the chemical structure of the Yukawa, and the effects of the chemical structure on the baryon asymmetry can be greatly increased or decreased depending on the type of the Yukawa. In the first place, we study the general formalism of the Yukawa and the sen. In this form, we can analyze the effect of the senaring on the baryon asymmetry. We have obtained new insight into the asymmetry of the Yukawa in the production of baryon asymmetry.

Use the first plural person form. Use active voice.","  We present a detailed analysis of the Galaxy Stellar Mass Function of
galaxies up to z=2.5 as obtained from the VVDS. We estimate the stellar mass
from broad-band photometry using 2 different assumptions on the galaxy star
formation history and show that the addition of secondary bursts to a
continuous star formation history produces systematically higher (up to 40%)
stellar masses. At low redshift (z=0.2) we find a substantial population of
low-mass galaxies (<10^9 Msun) composed by faint blue galaxies (M_I-M_K=0.3).
In general the stellar mass function evolves slowly up to z=0.9 and more
significantly above this redshift. Conversely, a massive tail is present up to
z=2.5 and have extremely red colours (M_I-M_K=0.7-0.8). We find a decline with
redshift of the overall number density of galaxies for all masses (59+-5% for
M>10^8 Msun at z=1), and a mild mass-dependent average evolution
(`mass-downsizing'). In particular our data are consistent with mild/negligible
(<30%) evolution up to z=0.7 for massive galaxies (>6x10^10 Msun). For less
massive systems the no-evolution scenario is excluded. A large fraction (>=50%)
of massive galaxies have been already assembled and converted most of their gas
into stars at z=1, ruling out the `dry mergers' as the major mechanism of their
assembly history below z=1. This fraction decreases to 33% at z=2. Low-mass
systems have decreased continuously in number and mass density (by a factor up
to 4) from the present age to z=2, consistently with a prolonged mass assembly
also at z<1.
","This study, in which we analyze and describe, studies the assembly history of galaxies at all temperatures, from young to old. We know how to understand the complex interaction between the different processes that produce galaxies and provide important information about the evolution of galaxies over cosmic time. Our goal is to understand the development and evolution of galaxies over a wide range of temperatures. The fusion of the atoms of the stars and the fusion of the stars is based on two main principles: mergers and smooth accretion. The mergers dominate the growth of large galaxies and are the foundation of old, compact structures. At high temperatures, the mergers dominate the growth of the large galaxies, and the compact structures are formed with old ones. At low temperatures, the mergers diminish, and the smooth accretion increases, which results in the formation of new, larger structures with younger ones.

  scattering in PoGOLite. Describe  problem work attempts to solve, the key ideas and methodology, and the motivation for the research in a formal academic and scientific writing voice. Use the first plural person form. Use active voice.","  Linear polarization in X- and gamma-rays is an important diagnostic of many
astrophysical sources, foremost giving information about their geometry,
magnetic fields, and radiation mechanisms. However, very few X-ray polarization
measurements have been made, and then only mono-energetic detections, whilst
several objects are assumed to have energy dependent polarization signatures.
In this paper we investigate whether detection of energy dependent polarization
from cosmic sources is possible using the Compton technique, in particular with
the proposed PoGOLite balloon-experiment, in the 25-100 keV range. We use
Geant4 simulations of a PoGOLite model and input photon spectra based on Cygnus
X-1 and accreting magnetic pulsars (100 mCrab). Effective observing times of 6
and 35 hours were simulated, corresponding to a standard and a long duration
flight respectively. Both smooth and sharp energy variations of the
polarization are investigated and compared to constant polarization signals
using chi-square statistics. We can reject constant polarization, with energy,
for the Cygnus X-1 spectrum (in the hard state), if the reflected component is
assumed to be completely polarized, whereas the distinction cannot be made for
weaker polarization. For the accreting pulsar, constant polarization can be
rejected in the case of polarization in a narrow energy band with at least 50%
polarization, and similarly for a negative step distribution from 30% to 0%
polarization.
","The result of our research was to find out more about the structure, composition, and evolution of these astrophysical sources. The study of this material was inspired by the need to gain a better understanding of the gamma rays, namely black holes, pulsars, and supernovae. The method we propose aims to determine the polarization of the soft gamma rays in an unbiased way. Our method exploits the Compton scattering effect, which is a very sensitive and precise instrument, that is designed to measure the hard X rays and the soft gamma rays. The proposed method employs the Compton scattering effect in the PoGOlite instrument, which is adapted to measure hard X rays and soft gamma rays. The study is motivated by the need to understand gamma ray sources, which include black holes, pulsars and supernovae. The gamma rays have a special significance, and they have been neglected in astronomy. Our work aims to address this gap in astronomy, by proposing a new method of measuring energy-dependent polarization.
