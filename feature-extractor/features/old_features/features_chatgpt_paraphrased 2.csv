relations of quantum mechanics systems, known as the polymer representation has
gained some attention in recent years, due to its possible relation with Planck
scale physics. In particular, this approach has been followed in a symmetric
sector of loop quantum gravity known as loop quantum cosmology. Here we explore
different aspects of the relation between the ordinary Schroedinger theory and
the polymer description. The paper has two parts. In the first one, we derive
the polymer quantum mechanics starting from the ordinary Schroedinger theory
and show that the polymer description arises as an appropriate limit. In the
second part we consider the continuum limit of this theory, namely, the reverse
process in which one starts from the discrete theory and tries to recover back
the ordinary Schroedinger quantum mechanics. We consider several examples of
interest, including the harmonic oscillator, the free particle and a simple
cosmological model.
","We examine the continuum limit of polymer mechanics, based on the method of path integral representations, and we present the results in numerical simulation. Our work is relevant to the understanding of the thermodynamic properties of polymers, and to the information and the communication of materials. In our research, we aim to explain the behavior of polymer chains and its relation to classical theory. We will investigate the structure of a path in polymer chains, and in the continuum limit, we will give a good idea of how far it can be stretched. We will give a good idea of the relationship between the network and the pattern. The relationship between the two is studied. In this paper, we are addressing the continuum limit of polymer mechanics. We investigate the relationship of the strands to the pattern. In the configuration space, there is a continuous path, and the polymer should display a continuum. We have shown that the spatial variable in this space is quite possible, when stretched out a long distance. In this work, we study the connection of the strands.

of criteria for isolating bona fide young stellar objects, YSO's, from the
extensive background contamination by extra-galactic objects. We then discuss
the properties of the resulting high confidence set of YSO's. We find 235 such
objects in the 0.85 deg^2 field that was covered with both IRAC and MIPS. An
additional set of 51 lower confidence YSO's outside this area is identified
from the MIPS data combined with 2MASS photometry. We describe two sets of
results, color-color diagrams to compare our observed source properties with
those of theoretical models for star/disk/envelope systems and our own modeling
of the subset of our objects that appear to be star+disks. These objects
exhibit a very wide range of disk properties, from many that can be fit with
actively accreting disks to some with both passive disks and even possibly
debris disks. We find that the luminosity function of YSO's in Serpens extends
down to at least a few x .001 Lsun or lower for an assumed distance of 260 pc.
The lower limit may be set by our inability to distinguish YSO's from
extra-galactic sources more than by the lack of YSO's at very low luminosities.
A spatial clustering analysis shows that the nominally less-evolved YSO's are
more highly clustered than the later stages and that the background
extra-galactic population can be fit by the same two-point correlation function
as seen in other extra-galactic studies. We also present a table of matches
between several previous infrared and X-ray studies of the Serpens YSO
population and our Spitzer data set.

in quiescence during 1991 and 2001 are presented. Spin-modulated radial
velocities consistent with an outer disc origin were detected for the first
time in an IP. The spin pulsation was modulated with velocities near ~500-600
km/s. These velocities are consistent with those of material circulating at the
outer edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretion
curtain with material near the Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Doppler
tomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extending
from velocities of ~500 km/s to ~1000 km/s. These findings have confirmed the
theoretical model predictions of King & Wynn (1999), Belle et al. (2002) and
Norton et al. (2004) for EX Hya, which predict large accretion curtains that
extend to a distance close to the Roche lobe radius in this system. Evidence
for overflow stream of material falling onto the magnetosphere was observed,
confirming the result of Belle et al. (2005) that disc overflow in EX Hya is
present during quiescence as well as outburst. It appears that the hbeta and
hgamma spin radial velocities originated from the rotation of the funnel at the
outer disc edge, while those of halpha were produced due to the flow of
material along the field lines far from the white dwarf (narrow component) and
close to the white dwarf (broad-base component), in agreement with the
accretion curtain model.

equations with non-commutative vector fields whose solution evolves on a smooth

along the manifold, we pull back the stochastic flow on the manifold to the Lie
group via the action, and subsequently pull back the flow to the corresponding
Lie algebra via the exponential map. We construct an approximation to the
stochastic flow in the Lie algebra via closed operations and then push back to
the Lie group and then to the manifold, thus ensuring our approximation lies in
the manifold. We call such schemes stochastic Munthe-Kaas methods after their
deterministic counterparts. We also present stochastic Lie group integration
schemes based on Castell--Gaines methods. These involve using an underlying
ordinary differential integrator to approximate the flow generated by a
truncated stochastic exponential Lie series. They become stochastic Lie group
integrator schemes if we use Munthe-Kaas methods as the underlying ordinary
differential integrator. Further, we show that some Castell--Gaines methods are
uniformly more accurate than the corresponding stochastic Taylor schemes.
Lastly we demonstrate our methods by simulating the dynamics of a free rigid
body such as a satellite and an autonomous underwater vehicle both perturbed by
two independent multiplicative stochastic noise processes.

The Euler-Maruyama method, for instance, does not preserve the geometrical structure of Lie groups, which causes errors in time, and which are eventually to be discovered. This method is of great use in the field of deterministic and control analysis, and has opened up new avenues for new applications in the fields of deterministic and control theory. In this paper, we introduce a new method for integrating Lie differential equations on Lie groups, using the Lie-group integrator.

Here we point out the potential of chromospheric observations at millimeter
wavelengths to resolve this long-standing problem. Computations carried out
with a sophisticated dynamic model of the solar chromosphere due to Carlsson
and Stein demonstrate that millimeter emission is extremely sensitive to
dynamic processes in the chromosphere and the appropriate wavelengths to look
for dynamic signatures are in the range 0.8-5.0 mm. The model also suggests
that high resolution observations at mm wavelengths, as will be provided by
ALMA, will have the unique property of reacting to both the hot and the cool
gas, and thus will have the potential of distinguishing between rival models of
the solar atmosphere. Thus, initial results obtained from the observations of
the quiet Sun at 3.5 mm with the BIMA array (resolution of 12 arcsec) reveal
significant oscillations with amplitudes of 50-150 K and frequencies of 1.5-8
mHz with a tendency toward short-period oscillations in internetwork and longer
periods in network regions. However higher spatial resolution, such as that
provided by ALMA, is required for a clean separation between the features
within the solar atmosphere and for an adequate comparison with the output of
the comprehensive dynamic simulations.

propagation through the SN envelope within a three-neutrino framework, paying
special attention to the inclusion of NSI-induced resonant conversions, which
may take place in the most deleptonised inner layers. We study the possibility
of detecting NSI effects in a Megaton water Cherenkov detector, either through
modulation effects in the $\bar\nu_e$ spectrum due to (i) the passage of shock
waves through the SN envelope, (ii) the time dependence of the electron
fraction and (iii) the Earth matter effects; or, finally, through the possible
detectability of the neutronization $\nu_e$ burst. We find that the $\bar\nu_e$
spectrum can exhibit dramatic features due to the internal NSI-induced resonant
conversion. This occurs for non-universal NSI strengths of a few %, and for
very small flavor-changing NSI above a few$\times 10^{-5}$.

Our work is a proof of the importance of studying non-standard neutrino interactions in supernovae, and provides a framework for testing and configuring such interactions. The results show that NSI significantly affects the neutrino signal, and the deviations from the standard value are significant.

based on restriction of nonequilibrium entropy (entropy ""trimming"") and (ii)
based on filtering of nonequilibrium entropy (entropy filtering). The physical
properties of LBM provide some additional benefits: the control of entropy
production and accurate estimate of introduced artificial dissipation are

The key assumptions are that the turbulence is anisotropic with respect to the
mean magnetic field and frequencies are low compared to the ion cyclotron
frequency. The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted
into heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETIC
CASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and
velocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each of
the physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematically
reduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the ""inertial range"" above the
ion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenic
fluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisional
and collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,
which obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated
with the Alfvenic component. In the ""dissipation range"" between the ion and
electron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave
(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive
phase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings the
energy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionless
wave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the
phase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at the
electron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scaling
relations are derived for these cascades. Astrophysical and space-physical
applications are discussed in detail.
","At this stage of our study, we present the kinetic and fluid kinetics of weakly collisional plasmas, which are endemic in astrophysical systems, and play a central role in the transfer of energy.

on the adiabatic evolution of isolated solitary waves and periodic wave trains
in the presence of variable topography and bottom friction, modeled by the
Chezy law, but also importantly, to study the effects of these factors on the
propagation of undular bores, which are essentially unsteady in the system
under consideration. In particular, it is shown that the combined action of
variable topography and bottom friction generally imposes certain global
restrictions on the undular bore propagation so that the evolution of the
leading solitary wave can be substantially different from that of an isolated
solitary wave with the same initial amplitude. This non-local effect is due to
nonlinear wave interactions within the undular bore and can lead to an
additional solitary wave amplitude growth, which cannot be predicted in the
framework of the traditional adiabatic approach to the propagation of solitary
waves in slowly varying media.

a sensor antenna and a general regression neural network, which solves the
location problem based on learning from examples. Locator performance was
tested on different test specimens. Tests have shown that the accuracy of
location depends on sound velocity and attenuation in the specimen, the
dimensions of the tested area, and the properties of stored data. The location
accuracy achieved by the intelligent locator is comparable to that obtained by
the conventional triangulation method, while the applicability of the
intelligent locator is more general since analysis of sonic ray paths is
avoided. This is a promising method for non-destructive testing of aircraft

interlayer binding and thus a consistent account of the nonlocal dispersive
interactions. This is included seamlessly with ordinary DFT by a van der Waals
density functional (vdW-DF) approach [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 246401 (2004)]. The
use of the vdW-DF is found to stabilize the graphite crystal, with crystal
parameters in fair agreement with experiments. For graphite and
potassium-intercalated graphite structural parameters such as binding
separation, layer binding energy, formation energy, and bulk modulus are
reported. Also the adsorption and sub-surface potassium absorption energies are
reported. The vdW-DF description, compared with the traditional semilocal

an orbit indistinguishable from circular, $e=0.012 \pm 0.021$. We demonstrate
generally that the surface gravity of the secondary star in a single-lined

light curve and spectroscopic orbit. This constrains the secondary to a unique
line in the mass-radius diagram with $M/R^2$ = constant. For HAT-TR-205-013, we
assume the orbit has been tidally circularized, and that the primary's rotation
has been synchronized and aligned with the orbital axis. Our observed line
broadening, $V_{\rm rot} \sin i_{\rm rot} = 28.9 \pm 1.0$ \kms, gives a primary
radius of $R_{\rm A} = 1.28 \pm 0.04$ \rsun. Our light curve analysis leads to
the radius of the secondary, $R_{\rm B} = 0.167 \pm 0.006$ \rsun, and the
semimajor axis of the orbit, $a = 7.54 \pm 0.30 \rsun = 0.0351 \pm 0.0014$ AU.

correlation lengths diverge when SAQDs are allowed to form at a near-critical

a stochastic process, and various mathematical aspects regarding statistical

rate of the cohomological class then the expanding cohomological class gives
sufficient ""marching orders"" to the system to prohibit the formation of any
other such invariant current of the same type (say from some local dynamical
subsystem). Because we use subsheaves of the sheaf of currents we give
conditions under which a subsheaf will have the same cohomology as the sheaf
containing it. Using a smoothing argument this allows us to show that the sheaf
cohomology of the currents under consideration can be canonically identified
with the deRham cohomology groups. Our main theorem can be applied in both the
smooth and holomorphic setting.
","It was proposed that a method of analyzing the behaviour of a certain class of dynamical systems should be developed, and it is a method of studying the behavior of a number of different dynamical systems in a manner that is both accurate and efficient. The object of this work was to construct a system of a type of Cohomology, a system of the mathematical algebraic topology, which was very well developed for this purpose, and which, moreover, had been shown to be compatible with the underlying dynamics of the system. These currents, called Cohomological Currents, are derived from the property that the correlations of the CEMs are decayed. The cohomological Currents, in particular, possess the properties of decaying Cohomology, which allow them to be constructed in a way that is compatible with the dynamics of the system. In this work, we are trying to investigate the properties of Cohomologically Expanded Maps, a class of dynamic systems which have been studied extensively. Their behaviour is rich in diversity, and they exhibit a high degree of mixing and expansion in some directions, which makes them an appropriate tool for the study of chaotic systems.

depends on cluster half-mass density (rho_h) in the sense that the turnover
mass M_TO increases with rho_h while the width of the GCMF decreases. We argue
that this is the expected signature of the slow erosion of a mass function that
initially rose towards low masses, predominantly through cluster evaporation
driven by internal two-body relaxation. We find excellent agreement between the
observed GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, central
concentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model in
which the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by
-dM/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1/2}. In particular, we recover the well-known
insensitivity of M_TO to r_gc. This feature does not derive from a literal
``universality'' of the GCMF turnover mass, but rather from a significant
variation of M_TO with rho_h -- the expected outcome of relaxation-driven
cluster disruption -- plus significant scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc.
Our conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are assumed to depend
instead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidal
radii, as mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1/2} or mu_ev ~ Sigma_t^{3/4} -- alternative
prescriptions that are physically motivated but involve cluster properties
(rho_t and Sigma_t) that are not as well defined or as readily observable as
rho_h. In all cases, the normalization of mu_ev required to fit the GCMF
implies cluster lifetimes that are within the range of standard values
(although falling towards the low end of this range). Our analysis does not
depend on any assumptions or information about velocity anisotropy in the
globular cluster system.

manner. According to the behaviors at the infinity, they are classified into
two kinds, domain-wall (DW) type and phase-shift (PS) type. The DW-type implies
the ferromagnetic state with nonzero total spin and the PS-type implies the
polar state, where the total spin amounts to zero. We also discuss two-soliton
collisions. In particular, the spin-mixing phenomenon is confirmed in a

additional term describing bulk energy losses due to inelastic collisions. We
employ Lagrangian coordinates and derive a broad family of exact non-stationary
analytical solutions that depend only on one spatial coordinate. These
solutions exhibit a new type of singularity, where the gas density blows up in
a finite time when starting from smooth initial conditions. The density blowups
signal formation of close-packed clusters of particles. As the density blow-up
time $t_c$ is approached, the maximum density exhibits a power law $\sim
(t_c-t)^{-2}$. The velocity gradient blows up as $\sim - (t_c-t)^{-1}$ while
the velocity itself remains continuous and develops a cusp (rather than a shock
discontinuity) at the singularity. The gas temperature vanishes at the
singularity, and the singularity follows the isobaric scenario: the gas
pressure remains finite and approximately uniform in space and constant in time
close to the singularity. An additional exact solution shows that the density
blowup, of the same type, may coexist with an ""ordinary"" shock, at which the
hydrodynamic fields are discontinuous but finite. We confirm stability of the
exact solutions with respect to small one-dimensional perturbations by solving
the ideal hydrodynamic equations numerically. Furthermore, numerical solutions
show that the local features of the density blowup hold universally,
independently of details of the initial and boundary conditions.

space-time lagrangian density evaluated on a restricted set of field
configurations, called universal sector, turns out to be same around all the
pp-waves, even off-shell, with same transverse space and same profiles for the
background scalars. In this paper we restrict our discussion to tensorial
fields only. In the context of bosonic string theory we consider on-shell
pp-waves and argue that universality requires the existence of a universal
sector of world-sheet operators whose correlation functions are insensitive to
the pp-wave nature of the metric and the background gauge flux. Such results
can also be reproduced using the world-sheet conformal field theory. We also
study such pp-waves in non-polynomial closed string field theory (CSFT). In
particular, we argue that for an off-shell pp-wave ansatz with flat transverse
space and dilaton independent of transverse coordinates the field redefinition
relating the low energy effective field theory and CSFT with all the massive
modes integrated out is at most quadratic in fields. Because of this
simplification it is expected that the off-shell pp-waves can be identified on
the two sides. Furthermore, given the massless pp-wave field configurations, an
iterative method for computing the higher massive modes using the CSFT
equations of motion has been discussed. All our bosonic string theory analyses
can be generalised to the common Neveu-Schwarz sector of superstrings.

Phenomena of branching and long-time refractority (absence of the reaction on
the external pulses) for deterministic chaotic and regular processes of SE were
observed in experiments with various levels of electromagnetic pumping. At the
pumping level growth, the clearly depined increasing of the number of
coexisting SE states has been observed both in real physical experiments and in
computer simulations. This confirms the analytical estimations of the branching
density in the phase space. The nature of the refractority of SE pulses is
closely connected with the pointed branching and reflects the crises of strange
attractors, i.e. their collisions with unstable periodic components of the
higher branches of SE states in the nonautonomous microwave phonon laser.

Bursts. Since bursts fade rapidly, it is desirable to create and disseminate

  Aims. To provide the community with an online repository of X-ray light
curves obtained with Swift. The light curves should be of the quality expected
of published data, but automatically created and updated so as to be
self-consistent and rapidly available. Methods. We have produced a suite of
programs which automatically generates Swift/XRT light curves of GRBs. Effects
of the damage to the CCD, automatic readout-mode switching and pile-up are
appropriately handled, and the data are binned with variable bin durations, as
necessary for a fading source.
  Results. The light curve repository website
(http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_curves) contains light curves, hardness ratios and
deep images for every GRB which Swift's XRT has observed. When new GRBs are
detected, light curves are created and updated within minutes of the data
arriving at the UK Swift Science Data Centre.

nearly extremal Kerr black hole. For very rapidly rotating black holes (spin
a=J/M>0.9524M) we have found a class of very strong field eccentric orbits
whose angular momentum L_z increases with the orbit's inclination with respect
to the equatorial plane, while keeping latus rectum and eccentricity fixed.
This behavior is in contrast with Newtonian intuition, and is in fact opposite
to the ""normal"" behavior of black hole orbits. Such behavior was noted
previously for circular orbits; since it only applies to orbits very close to
the black hole, they were named ""nearly horizon-skimming orbits"". Our analysis
generalizes this result, mapping out the full generic (inclined and eccentric)
family of nearly horizon-skimming orbits. The earlier work on circular orbits
reported that, under gravitational radiation emission, nearly horizon-skimming
orbits tend to evolve to smaller orbit inclination, toward prograde equatorial
configuration. Normal orbits, by contrast, always demonstrate slowly growing
orbit inclination (orbits evolve toward the retrograde equatorial
configuration). Using up-to-date Teukolsky-fluxes, we have concluded that the
earlier result was incorrect: all circular orbits, including nearly
horizon-skimming ones, exhibit growing orbit inclination. Using kludge fluxes
based on a Post-Newtonian expansion corrected with fits to circular and to
equatorial Teukolsky-fluxes, we argue that the inclination grows also for
eccentric nearly horizon-skimming orbits. We also find that the inclination
change is, in any case, very small. As such, we conclude that these orbits are
not likely to have a clear and peculiar imprint on the gravitational waveforms
expected to be measured by the space-based detector LISA.
","To make this work we employed two methods of calculating the behavior of orbits around the horizon. The first is a perturbation technique to study the behavior of orbits which approach the horizon. Then we investigate the effects of eccentricity and inclination on the behavior of orbits. This study provides new insights into the behavior of orbits near the horizon, and thus may be of great interest to the understanding of black hole dynamics and accretion. In this study we have analyzed the properties of orbits near the horizon. We have found that circular orbits near the horizon can be chaotic, due to the strong gravitational field around the black hole. In addition, we have found that non-circular orbits can be subjected to substantial energy dissipation, and which could have important consequences for astrophysics, such as accretion disks. We study a number of interesting phenomena, which are related to the orbits near the horizon, and the behavior of orbits around the horizon.

circulation, superfluids are irrotational, and any rotation or angular momentum
is constrained to occur through vortices with quantized circulation. Quantized
vortices also play a key role in the dissipation of transport in superfluids.
In BECs quantized vortices have been observed in several forms, including
single vortices, vortex lattices, and vortex pairs and rings. The recent
observation of quantized vortices in a fermionic gas was taken as a clear
signature of the underlying condensation and superfluidity of fermion pairs. In
addition to BECs, quantized vortices also occur in superfluid Helium, nonlinear
optics, and type-II superconductors.

We examine the dynamics of vortices, their motion and interactions, both in the presence of external potentials and in homogeneous systems.

to the phonon-induced strain, and the coaction of the

both the spin relaxation time $T_1$ and the spin dephasing time $T_2$, either

temperature, we demonstrate how to obtain the spin relaxation time from the
Fermi Golden rule in the limit of weak spin-orbit coupling. However, at high
temperature and/or for large spin-orbit coupling, one has to use the
equation-of-motion approach when many levels are involved. Moreover, spin
dephasing can be much more efficient than spin relaxation at high temperature,

transfer matrix renormalization group (TMRG) technique is applied to explore
the thermodynamic properties. The local magnetic moments, spin correlation
functions, and static structure factors are discussed in the ground state for
the three cases. It is shown that the static structure factor S(q) shows peaks
at wavevectors $q=a\pi /3$ (a=0,1,2,3,4,5) for different couplings in a zero
magnetic field, which, however in the magnetic fields where the magnetization
plateau with m=1/6 pertains, exhibits the peaks only at q=0, $2\pi /3$ and
$4\pi /3$, which are found to be couplings-independent. The DMRG results of the
zero-field static structure factor can be nicely fitted by a linear
superposition of six modes, where two fitting equations are proposed. It is
observed that the six modes are closely related to the low-lying excitations of
the system. At finite temperatures, the double-peak structures of the
susceptibility and specific heat against temperature are obtained, where the
peak positions and heights are found to depend on the competition of the

foliation on $M$, with isolated singularities of Morse type. The study and
classification of pairs $(M,\F)$ is a challenging (and difficult) problem. In
this setting, a classical result due to Reeb \cite{Reeb} states that a manifold
admitting a foliation with exactly two center-type singularities is a sphere.
In particular this is true if the foliation is given by a function. Along these
lines a result due to Eells and Kuiper \cite{Ku-Ee} classify manifolds having a
real-valued function admitting exactly three non-degenerate singular points. In
the present paper, we prove a generalization of the above mentioned results. To
do this, we first describe the possible arrangements of pairs of singularities
and the corresponding codimension one invariant sets, and then we give an
elimination procedure for suitable center-saddle and some saddle-saddle
configurations (of consecutive indices). In the second part, we investigate if
other classical results, such as Haefliger and Novikov (Compact Leaf) theorems,
proved for regular foliations, still hold true in presence of singularities. At
this purpose, in the singular set, $Sing(\F)$ of the foliation $\F$, we
consider {\em{weakly stable}} components, that we define as those components
admitting a neighborhood where all leaves are compact. If $Sing(\F)$ admits
only weakly stable components, given by smoothly embedded curves diffeomorphic
to $S^1$, we are able to extend Haefliger's theorem. Finally, the existence of
a closed curve, transverse to the foliation, leads us to state a Novikov-type
result.
","In addition, we investigate the relationship between the singularities and the topology, particularly the cohomology and homotopy groups. The results are: the classification of smooth foliated foliations up to isotopy. The classification of foliated foliations to isotopy is based on the bifurcation diagrams of the foliated foliations, and on the intersections of them. It can be used to discover and study the dynamics of foliated foliations. In our research, we are primarily interested in the properties of smooth foliated foliations with Morse.

controversial from a statistical point of view, as the frequentist vs. bayesian
confrontation shows. We analyse several relevant questions which have not
deserved full attention and pervade the extraction of $\alpha$.
Reparametrization Invariance proves appropriate to understand those issues. We
show that some Standard Model inspired parametrizations can be senseless or
inadequate if they go beyond the minimal Gronau and London assumptions: the
single weak phase $\alpha$ just in the $\Delta I=3/2$ amplitudes, the isospin
relations and experimental data. Beside those analyses, we extract $\alpha$
through the use of several adequate parametrizations, showing that there is no
relevant discrepancy between frequentist and bayesian results. The most
relevant information, in terms of $\alpha$, is the exclusion of values around
$\alpha\sim \pi/4$; this result is valid in the presence of arbitrary New
Physics contributions to the $\Delta I=1/2$ piece.
","We study the effects of reparametrization in the extraction of alpha from the decay of B to Pi-pi-pi. This method is based on angular correlations, and we investigate the effects of reparametrization and alpha without requiring the use of strong assumptions about the dynamics of the process. We conclude that reparametrization plays a vital role in the extraction of alpha, and that neglecting it can lead to biased or incorrect determinations. Our results demonstrate that reparametrization invariance is a crucial component of the extraction of alpha, and that it is crucial that we disregard it. Our results are shown to have important implications for the interpretation of future B-factory data and for the ongoing efforts to decipher the mysteries of CP violation.

The calculated transmission spectra of two configurations are strikingly
distinctive. The open form lacks any significant transmission peak within a
wide energy window, while the closed structure has two significant transmission
peaks on the both sides of the Fermi level. The electronic transport properties
of the molecular junction with closed structure under a small bias voltage are
mainly determined by the tail of the transmission peak contributed unusually by
the perturbed lowest perturbed unoccupied molecular orbital. The calculated
on-off ratio of currents between the closed and open configurations is about
two orders of magnitude, which reproduces the essential features of the

from 300K to 900K; Young's modulus and the tensile strengths are decreasing
with increasing temperature while the Poisson ratio is increasing. At higher
temperatures, Young's modulus starts to increase while the Poisson ratio and
tensile strength decrease. In the temperature range from 1200K to 1800K, the
SWCNT is already deformed and softened. Applying strain on these deformed and
softened SWCNTs do not follow the same pattern as in the temperature range of

the two quasars whose intergalactic HeII forest has been resolved with FUSE. By
analysing the HI and the HeII opacity variations separately, no transverse
proximity effect is detected near three foreground quasars of HE2347-4342:
QSOJ23503-4328 (z=2.282, $\vartheta=3.59$ arcmin), QSOJ23500-4319 (z=2.302,
$\vartheta=8.77$ arcmin) and QSOJ23495-4338 (z=2.690, $\vartheta=16.28$
arcmin). This is primarily due to line contamination and overdensities probably
created by large-scale structure. By comparing the HI absorption and the
corresponding HeII absorption, we estimated the fluctuating spectral shape of
the extragalactic UV radiation field along this line of sight. We find that the
UV spectral shape near HE2347-4342 and in the projected vicinity of the three
foreground quasars is statistically harder than expected from UV background
models dominated by quasars. In addition, we find three highly ionised metal
line systems near the quasars. However, they do not yield further constraints
on the shape of the ionising field. We conclude that the foreground quasars
show a transverse proximity effect that is detectable as a local hardening of
the UV radiation field, although the evidence is strongest for QSOJ23495-4338.
Thus, the relative spectral hardness traces the proximity effect also in
overdense regions prohibiting the traditional detection in the HI forest.
Furthermore, we emphasise that softening of quasar radiation by radiative
transfer in the intergalactic medium is important to understand the observed
spectral shape variations. From the transverse proximity effect of
QSOJ23495-4338 we obtain a lower limit on the quasar lifetime of ~25 Myr.
","The result was that the spectral hardness of the absorbed gas was systematically different on either side of the quasar, which indicated that the transverse proximity of the gas was altering the physical properties of the gas in question.

under our [Time Sequential Simulation], it is concluded that the measurement of
the direction of the incident neutrino for the neutrino events occurring inside
the detector in the SK analysis turns out to be unreliable, which holds
irrespective of the existence and/or non-existence of the neutrino oscillation.
","In order to test the accuracy of the fluxes, we studied the results of Monte Carlo simulations of the semi-elastic, and compared the fluxes of the proton to the true direction. Our findings show that the fluxes of the proton can be reliably guessed in a fully-elastic event at an angle of less than one degree, but that in the partially-elastic cases, where a small fraction of the energy passes through the detector, it becomes more difficult to obtain the proper direction for the sub-elastic.

complex knot discovered to date in human ubiquitin hydrolase, and suggest that
its entangled topology protects it against unfolding and degradation by the
proteasome. Knots in proteins are typically preserved across species and
sometimes even across kingdoms. However, we also identify a knot which only
appears in some transcarbamylases while being absent in homologous proteins of
similar structure. The emergence of the knot is accompanied by a shift in the
enzymatic function of the protein. We suggest that the simple insertion of a
short DNA fragment into the gene may suffice to turn an unknotted into a
knotted structure in this protein.

different aspects of the relation between the ordinary Schroedinger theory and

of the subset of our objects that appear to be star+disks. These objects
exhibit a very wide range of disk properties, from many that can be fit with
actively accreting disks to some with both passive disks and even possibly
debris disks. We find that the luminosity function of YSO's in Serpens extends
down to at least a few x .001 Lsun or lower for an assumed distance of 260 pc.
The lower limit may be set by our inability to distinguish YSO's from
extra-galactic sources more than by the lack of YSO's at very low luminosities.
A spatial clustering analysis shows that the nominally less-evolved YSO's are
more highly clustered than the later stages and that the background
extra-galactic population can be fit by the same two-point correlation function
as seen in other extra-galactic studies. We also present a table of matches

velocities consistent with an outer disc origin were detected for the first
time in an IP. The spin pulsation was modulated with velocities near ~500-600
km/s. These velocities are consistent with those of material circulating at the
outer edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretion
curtain with material near the Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Doppler
tomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extending
from velocities of ~500 km/s to ~1000 km/s. These findings have confirmed the
theoretical model predictions of King & Wynn (1999), Belle et al. (2002) and
Norton et al. (2004) for EX Hya, which predict large accretion curtains that
extend to a distance close to the Roche lobe radius in this system. Evidence
for overflow stream of material falling onto the magnetosphere was observed,
confirming the result of Belle et al. (2005) that disc overflow in EX Hya is
present during quiescence as well as outburst. It appears that the hbeta and
hgamma spin radial velocities originated from the rotation of the funnel at the
outer disc edge, while those of halpha were produced due to the flow of
material along the field lines far from the white dwarf (narrow component) and
close to the white dwarf (broad-base component), in agreement with the

along the manifold, we pull back the stochastic flow on the manifold to the Lie
group via the action, and subsequently pull back the flow to the corresponding
Lie algebra via the exponential map. We construct an approximation to the
stochastic flow in the Lie algebra via closed operations and then push back to
the Lie group and then to the manifold, thus ensuring our approximation lies in
the manifold. We call such schemes stochastic Munthe-Kaas methods after their
deterministic counterparts. We also present stochastic Lie group integration
schemes based on Castell--Gaines methods. These involve using an underlying
ordinary differential integrator to approximate the flow generated by a
truncated stochastic exponential Lie series. They become stochastic Lie group
integrator schemes if we use Munthe-Kaas methods as the underlying ordinary
differential integrator. Further, we show that some Castell--Gaines methods are
uniformly more accurate than the corresponding stochastic Taylor schemes.

The Euler-Maruyama method, for instance, does not preserve the geometrical structure of Lie groups, which causes errors in time, and which are eventually to be discovered. This method is of great use in the field of deterministic and control analysis, and has opened up new avenues for new applications in the fields of deterministic and control theory. In this paper, we introduce a new method for integrating Lie differential equations on Lie groups, using the Lie-group integrator. The numerical experiments revealed that our method is more accurate and accurate than previous methods, with lower computational costs. We also present a method of integrating Lie-groups, which is suitable for numerically solving Lie-groups, with the result that we are able to converge with high accuracy and high stability. We have also applied our method to practical problems, which involve the motion of a rigid body in a liquid.

remains far from being properly understood, in spite of intensive research.
Here we point out the potential of chromospheric observations at millimeter
wavelengths to resolve this long-standing problem. Computations carried out
with a sophisticated dynamic model of the solar chromosphere due to Carlsson
and Stein demonstrate that millimeter emission is extremely sensitive to
dynamic processes in the chromosphere and the appropriate wavelengths to look
for dynamic signatures are in the range 0.8-5.0 mm. The model also suggests
that high resolution observations at mm wavelengths, as will be provided by
ALMA, will have the unique property of reacting to both the hot and the cool
gas, and thus will have the potential of distinguishing between rival models of
the solar atmosphere. Thus, initial results obtained from the observations of
the quiet Sun at 3.5 mm with the BIMA array (resolution of 12 arcsec) reveal
significant oscillations with amplitudes of 50-150 K and frequencies of 1.5-8
mHz with a tendency toward short-period oscillations in internetwork and longer
periods in network regions. However higher spatial resolution, such as that
provided by ALMA, is required for a clean separation between the features
within the solar atmosphere and for an adequate comparison with the output of
the comprehensive dynamic simulations.
","The Atacama Observatory’s optical system, which is a millimetre-wave instrument, is of particular use to us in this study. The system is able to be used in different conditions and to obtain data at different wavelengths, and the data collected with ALMA are compared to the solar model. The results of this research are presented, presenting the Atacama Observatory’s unique opportunity to study the chromosphere under various conditions, and comparing it with the solar model. Our work has demonstrated that ALMA has been able to extract valuable information about the chromosphere temperature, density and magnetic field, and thus it is possible to study the thermal properties of the chromosphere, revealing the heat and the source of the particles of matter, and thereby enabling us to better understand the Earth’s climate and the atmosphere of space.

propagation through the SN envelope within a three-neutrino framework, paying
special attention to the inclusion of NSI-induced resonant conversions, which
may take place in the most deleptonised inner layers. We study the possibility
of detecting NSI effects in a Megaton water Cherenkov detector, either through
modulation effects in the $\bar\nu_e$ spectrum due to (i) the passage of shock
waves through the SN envelope, (ii) the time dependence of the electron
fraction and (iii) the Earth matter effects; or, finally, through the possible
detectability of the neutronization $\nu_e$ burst. We find that the $\bar\nu_e$
spectrum can exhibit dramatic features due to the internal NSI-induced resonant
conversion. This occurs for non-universal NSI strengths of a few %, and for
very small flavor-changing NSI above a few$\times 10^{-5}$.

Our work is a proof of the importance of studying non-standard neutrino interactions in supernovae, and provides a framework for testing and configuring such interactions. The results show that NSI significantly affects the neutrino signal, and the deviations from the standard value are significant.

some S-wave I=0 T-matrices is then required. Once this is accounted for, the

based on restriction of nonequilibrium entropy (entropy ""trimming"") and (ii)
based on filtering of nonequilibrium entropy (entropy filtering). The physical
properties of LBM provide some additional benefits: the control of entropy
production and accurate estimate of introduced artificial dissipation are
possible. The constructed limiters are tested on classical numerical examples:
1D athermal shock tubes with an initial density ratio 1:2 and the 2D lid-driven

plasmas (solar wind, interstellar medium, galaxy clusters, accretion disks).
The key assumptions are that the turbulence is anisotropic with respect to the
mean magnetic field and frequencies are low compared to the ion cyclotron
frequency. The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted
into heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETIC
CASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and
velocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each of
the physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematically
reduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the ""inertial range"" above the
ion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenic
fluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisional
and collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,
which obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated
with the Alfvenic component. In the ""dissipation range"" between the ion and
electron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave
(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive
phase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings the
energy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionless
wave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the
phase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at the
electron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scaling
relations are derived for these cascades. Astrophysical and space-physical
applications are discussed in detail.

Chezy law, but also importantly, to study the effects of these factors on the
propagation of undular bores, which are essentially unsteady in the system

variable topography and bottom friction generally imposes certain global
restrictions on the undular bore propagation so that the evolution of the
leading solitary wave can be substantially different from that of an isolated
solitary wave with the same initial amplitude. This non-local effect is due to
nonlinear wave interactions within the undular bore and can lead to an
additional solitary wave amplitude growth, which cannot be predicted in the

theory. The bonding in the potassium-graphite compound is reasonably well
accounted for by traditional semilocal density functional theory (DFT)
calculations. However, to investigate the intercalate formation energy from
pure potassium atoms and graphite requires use of a description of the graphite
interlayer binding and thus a consistent account of the nonlocal dispersive
interactions. This is included seamlessly with ordinary DFT by a van der Waals
density functional (vdW-DF) approach [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 246401 (2004)]. The
use of the vdW-DF is found to stabilize the graphite crystal, with crystal
parameters in fair agreement with experiments. For graphite and
potassium-intercalated graphite structural parameters such as binding
separation, layer binding energy, formation energy, and bulk modulus are
reported. Also the adsorption and sub-surface potassium absorption energies are
reported. The vdW-DF description, compared with the traditional semilocal
approach, is found to weakly soften the elastic response.
","Moreover, it was discovered that the interaction between potassium and graphite is very dependent on the orientation of the potassium atoms, with the (001) orientation being the most important. This is especially relevant for the development of new materials for energy storage. The aim of this study is to determine how the intercalation of potassium and graphite can be tuned by varying the potassium concentration in graphite, and to establish the optimal voltage to be applied to this intercalation, which could be used for the design of new electrochemical materials. This is to determine the optimal voltage at which the intercalation occurs. In the present study we have studied the intercalation of potassium into graphite by using the van der Waals method of density functional calculations. We have found that the optimal voltage for intercalation is approximately 2.5 V, and that the intercalation of potassium is stronger in the adsorption of potassium than sodium.

secondary. The system's period is short, $P=2.230736 \pm 0.000010$ days, with
an orbit indistinguishable from circular, $e=0.012 \pm 0.021$. We demonstrate
generally that the surface gravity of the secondary star in a single-lined
binary undergoing total eclipses can be derived from characteristics of the
light curve and spectroscopic orbit. This constrains the secondary to a unique
line in the mass-radius diagram with $M/R^2$ = constant. For HAT-TR-205-013, we
assume the orbit has been tidally circularized, and that the primary's rotation
has been synchronized and aligned with the orbital axis. Our observed line
broadening, $V_{\rm rot} \sin i_{\rm rot} = 28.9 \pm 1.0$ \kms, gives a primary
radius of $R_{\rm A} = 1.28 \pm 0.04$ \rsun. Our light curve analysis leads to
the radius of the secondary, $R_{\rm B} = 0.167 \pm 0.006$ \rsun, and the
semimajor axis of the orbit, $a = 7.54 \pm 0.30 \rsun = 0.0351 \pm 0.0014$ AU.
Our single-lined spectroscopic orbit and the semimajor axis then yield the
individual masses, $M_{\rm B} = 0.124 \pm 0.010$ \msun and $M_{\rm A} = 1.04
\pm 0.13$ \msun. Our result for HAT-TR-205-013 B lies above the theoretical
mass-radius models from the Lyon group, consistent with results from
double-lined eclipsing binaries. The method we describe offers the opportunity

solved via a redefinition of the dynamical variables, similar to the normal
ordering procedure and containing it as a special case. That implies
corresponding changes in the admissible commutation relations. The introduction
of the concept of the vacuum makes narrow the class of the possible commutation
relations; in particular, the mentioned redefinition of the dynamical variables
is reduced to normal ordering. As a last restriction on that class is imposed
the requirement for existing of an effective procedure for calculating vacuum
mean values. The standard bilinear commutation relations are pointed as the
only known ones that satisfy all of the mentioned conditions and do not

types of order are strongly linked; thus, a study of spatial order will also
have strong implications for size order. Here a study of spatial order is
undertaken using a linear analysis of a commonly used model of SAQD formation
based on surface diffusion. Analytic formulas for film-height correlation
functions are found that characterize quantum dot spatial order and
corresponding correlation lengths that quantify order. Initial atomic-scale
random fluctuations result in relatively small correlation lengths (about two
dots) when the effect of a wetting potential is negligible; however, the
correlation lengths diverge when SAQDs are allowed to form at a near-critical
film height. The present work reinforces previous findings about anisotropy and
SAQD order and presents as explicit and transparent mechanism for ordering with
corresponding analytic equations. In addition, SAQD formation is by its nature
a stochastic process, and various mathematical aspects regarding statistical
analysis of SAQD formation and order are presented.

result that takes advantage of differences in rates of expansion in the terms
of a sheaf cohomological long exact sequence to create unique lifts of finite
dimensional invariant subspaces of one term of the sequence to invariant
subspaces of the preceding term. This allows us to take invariant cohomological
classes and under the right circumstances construct unique currents of a given
type, including unique measures of a given type, that represent those classes
and are invariant under pullback. A dynamically interesting self map may have a
plethora of invariant measures, so the uniquess of the constructed currents is
important. It means that if local growth is not too big compared to the growth
rate of the cohomological class then the expanding cohomological class gives
sufficient ""marching orders"" to the system to prohibit the formation of any
other such invariant current of the same type (say from some local dynamical
subsystem). Because we use subsheaves of the sheaf of currents we give
conditions under which a subsheaf will have the same cohomology as the sheaf
containing it. Using a smoothing argument this allows us to show that the sheaf
cohomology of the currents under consideration can be canonically identified
with the deRham cohomology groups. Our main theorem can be applied in both the
smooth and holomorphic setting.

depends on cluster half-mass density (rho_h) in the sense that the turnover
mass M_TO increases with rho_h while the width of the GCMF decreases. We argue
that this is the expected signature of the slow erosion of a mass function that
initially rose towards low masses, predominantly through cluster evaporation
driven by internal two-body relaxation. We find excellent agreement between the
observed GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, central
concentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model in
which the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by
-dM/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1/2}. In particular, we recover the well-known
insensitivity of M_TO to r_gc. This feature does not derive from a literal
``universality'' of the GCMF turnover mass, but rather from a significant
variation of M_TO with rho_h -- the expected outcome of relaxation-driven
cluster disruption -- plus significant scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc.
Our conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are assumed to depend
instead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidal
radii, as mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1/2} or mu_ev ~ Sigma_t^{3/4} -- alternative
prescriptions that are physically motivated but involve cluster properties
(rho_t and Sigma_t) that are not as well defined or as readily observable as
rho_h. In all cases, the normalization of mu_ev required to fit the GCMF
implies cluster lifetimes that are within the range of standard values
(although falling towards the low end of this range). Our analysis does not
depend on any assumptions or information about velocity anisotropy in the
globular cluster system.

manner. According to the behaviors at the infinity, they are classified into
two kinds, domain-wall (DW) type and phase-shift (PS) type. The DW-type implies
the ferromagnetic state with nonzero total spin and the PS-type implies the
polar state, where the total spin amounts to zero. We also discuss two-soliton
collisions. In particular, the spin-mixing phenomenon is confirmed in a

Use active voice.","  We employ granular hydrodynamics to investigate a paradigmatic problem of
clustering of particles in a freely cooling dilute granular gas. We consider
large-scale hydrodynamic motions where the viscosity and heat conduction can be
neglected, and one arrives at the equations of ideal gas dynamics with an
additional term describing bulk energy losses due to inelastic collisions. We
employ Lagrangian coordinates and derive a broad family of exact non-stationary
analytical solutions that depend only on one spatial coordinate. These
solutions exhibit a new type of singularity, where the gas density blows up in
a finite time when starting from smooth initial conditions. The density blowups
signal formation of close-packed clusters of particles. As the density blow-up
time $t_c$ is approached, the maximum density exhibits a power law $\sim
(t_c-t)^{-2}$. The velocity gradient blows up as $\sim - (t_c-t)^{-1}$ while
the velocity itself remains continuous and develops a cusp (rather than a shock
discontinuity) at the singularity. The gas temperature vanishes at the
singularity, and the singularity follows the isobaric scenario: the gas
pressure remains finite and approximately uniform in space and constant in time
close to the singularity. An additional exact solution shows that the density
blowup, of the same type, may coexist with an ""ordinary"" shock, at which the
hydrodynamic fields are discontinuous but finite. We confirm stability of the
exact solutions with respect to small one-dimensional perturbations by solving
the ideal hydrodynamic equations numerically. Furthermore, numerical solutions
show that the local features of the density blowup hold universally,
independently of details of the initial and boundary conditions.
","... The exact solutions that we obtained yield a wealth of information about the underlying dynamics, and can serve as a benchmark for both numerical simulations and experimental investigations. Our method of study involves the combination of Laplace transforms and asymptotism to find the exact solution of the hydrodynamic equations. We have derived the exact solutions of the hydrodynamic equations from the solution of the exact solutions. We have found that the elasticity of the system is subject to a contest between the cooling process, which results in a uniform decrease in the density, and the elastic collisions, which produce local density enhancements. This result will be shown by examining the formation of density singularities in the ideal hydrodynamics of inelastic gases. It has important implications for the understanding of the dynamics of these gases.

space-time expanded around pp-wave backgrounds. According to this property the
space-time lagrangian density evaluated on a restricted set of field
configurations, called universal sector, turns out to be same around all the
pp-waves, even off-shell, with same transverse space and same profiles for the
background scalars. In this paper we restrict our discussion to tensorial
fields only. In the context of bosonic string theory we consider on-shell
pp-waves and argue that universality requires the existence of a universal
sector of world-sheet operators whose correlation functions are insensitive to
the pp-wave nature of the metric and the background gauge flux. Such results
can also be reproduced using the world-sheet conformal field theory. We also
study such pp-waves in non-polynomial closed string field theory (CSFT). In
particular, we argue that for an off-shell pp-wave ansatz with flat transverse
space and dilaton independent of transverse coordinates the field redefinition
relating the low energy effective field theory and CSFT with all the massive
modes integrated out is at most quadratic in fields. Because of this
simplification it is expected that the off-shell pp-waves can be identified on
the two sides. Furthermore, given the massless pp-wave field configurations, an
iterative method for computing the higher massive modes using the CSFT
equations of motion has been discussed. All our bosonic string theory analyses
can be generalised to the common Neveu-Schwarz sector of superstrings.

by the scattering of data during calibration of experimental setup. A physical
law, which relates measured variables, is optimally extracted from experimental
data by the conditional average estimator. It is derived directly from the
kernel estimator and corresponds to a general nonparametric regression. The
proposed method is demonstrated by the modeling of a return map of noisy
chaotic data. In this example, the nonparametric regression is used to predict
a future value of chaotic time series from the present one. The mean predictor
error is used in the definition of predictor quality, while the redundancy is
expressed by the mean square distance between data points. Both statistics are
used in a new definition of predictor cost function. From the minimum of the
predictor cost function, a proper number of data in the model is estimated.

ratio of quark and gluon distributions in the medium. Such a modification is
not negligible for realistic kinematics and finite medium size. The
modifications to quark (antiquark) fragmentation functions from quark-antiquark
annihilation processes are shown to be determined by the antiquark (quark)

explains the experimentally observed flavor dependence of the leading hadron

configuration). Using up-to-date Teukolsky-fluxes, we have concluded that the
earlier result was incorrect: all circular orbits, including nearly
horizon-skimming ones, exhibit growing orbit inclination. Using kludge fluxes
based on a Post-Newtonian expansion corrected with fits to circular and to
equatorial Teukolsky-fluxes, we argue that the inclination grows also for
eccentric nearly horizon-skimming orbits. We also find that the inclination
change is, in any case, very small. As such, we conclude that these orbits are
not likely to have a clear and peculiar imprint on the gravitational waveforms
expected to be measured by the space-based detector LISA.
","To make this work we employed two methods of calculating the behavior of orbits around the horizon. The first is a perturbation technique to study the behavior of orbits which approach the horizon. Then we investigate the effects of eccentricity and inclination on the behavior of orbits. This study provides new insights into the behavior of orbits near the horizon, and thus may be of great interest to the understanding of black hole dynamics and accretion. In this study we have analyzed the properties of orbits near the horizon. We have found that circular orbits near the horizon can be chaotic, due to the strong gravitational field around the black hole. In addition, we have found that non-circular orbits can be subjected to substantial energy dissipation, and which could have important consequences for astrophysics, such as accretion disks. We study a number of interesting phenomena, which are related to the orbits near the horizon, and the behavior of orbits around the horizon.

flow and hence playing a key role in turbulence. The fluid rotation associated
with a vortex can be parameterized by the circulation $\Gamma=\oint {\rm d}{\bf

fluid velocity field. While classical vortices can take any value of
circulation, superfluids are irrotational, and any rotation or angular momentum
is constrained to occur through vortices with quantized circulation. Quantized
vortices also play a key role in the dissipation of transport in superfluids.
In BECs quantized vortices have been observed in several forms, including
single vortices, vortex lattices, and vortex pairs and rings. The recent
observation of quantized vortices in a fermionic gas was taken as a clear
signature of the underlying condensation and superfluidity of fermion pairs. In
addition to BECs, quantized vortices also occur in superfluid Helium, nonlinear
optics, and type-II superconductors.
","The work is carried out on a theoretical basis. We begin by presenting the basic physics of BECs, a mathematical description of the Gross-Pitaevsky equation. We then describe the formation of vortices in BECs and discuss the resulting vortices, which are quantized to angular momentum and with an angular momentum. We examine the dynamics of vortices, their motion and interactions, both in the presence of external potentials and in homogeneous systems. We examine the dynamics of vortices, and we discuss their asymmetrical properties and their quantized core. The dynamics of vortices is highly nonlinear and can lead to many fascinating phenomena, such as the formation of vortices and the formation of atoms. We conclude that the dynamics of vortices are highly nonlinear, and that, in some cases, they are connected, they are inherently entangled in the structure of the atoms and atoms, and they are not simply a random process, but a very complex one.

to the phonon-induced strain, and the coaction of the

both the spin relaxation time $T_1$ and the spin dephasing time $T_2$, either

Fermi Golden rule in the limit of weak spin-orbit coupling. However, at high
temperature and/or for large spin-orbit coupling, one has to use the
equation-of-motion approach when many levels are involved. Moreover, spin
dephasing can be much more efficient than spin relaxation at high temperature,

transfer matrix renormalization group (TMRG) technique is applied to explore
the thermodynamic properties. The local magnetic moments, spin correlation
functions, and static structure factors are discussed in the ground state for
the three cases. It is shown that the static structure factor S(q) shows peaks
at wavevectors $q=a\pi /3$ (a=0,1,2,3,4,5) for different couplings in a zero
magnetic field, which, however in the magnetic fields where the magnetization
plateau with m=1/6 pertains, exhibits the peaks only at q=0, $2\pi /3$ and
$4\pi /3$, which are found to be couplings-independent. The DMRG results of the
zero-field static structure factor can be nicely fitted by a linear
superposition of six modes, where two fitting equations are proposed. It is
observed that the six modes are closely related to the low-lying excitations of
the system. At finite temperatures, the double-peak structures of the

foliation on $M$, with isolated singularities of Morse type. The study and
classification of pairs $(M,\F)$ is a challenging (and difficult) problem. In
this setting, a classical result due to Reeb \cite{Reeb} states that a manifold
admitting a foliation with exactly two center-type singularities is a sphere.
In particular this is true if the foliation is given by a function. Along these
lines a result due to Eells and Kuiper \cite{Ku-Ee} classify manifolds having a
real-valued function admitting exactly three non-degenerate singular points. In
the present paper, we prove a generalization of the above mentioned results. To
do this, we first describe the possible arrangements of pairs of singularities
and the corresponding codimension one invariant sets, and then we give an
elimination procedure for suitable center-saddle and some saddle-saddle
configurations (of consecutive indices). In the second part, we investigate if
other classical results, such as Haefliger and Novikov (Compact Leaf) theorems,
proved for regular foliations, still hold true in presence of singularities. At
this purpose, in the singular set, $Sing(\F)$ of the foliation $\F$, we
consider {\em{weakly stable}} components, that we define as those components
admitting a neighborhood where all leaves are compact. If $Sing(\F)$ admits
only weakly stable components, given by smoothly embedded curves diffeomorphic
to $S^1$, we are able to extend Haefliger's theorem. Finally, the existence of
a closed curve, transverse to the foliation, leads us to state a Novikov-type
result.

The classification of foliated foliations to isotopy is based on the bifurcation diagrams of the foliated foliations, and on the intersections of them. It can be used to discover and study the dynamics of foliated foliations. In our research, we are primarily interested in the properties of smooth foliated foliations with Morse.

Reparametrization Invariance proves appropriate to understand those issues. We
show that some Standard Model inspired parametrizations can be senseless or
inadequate if they go beyond the minimal Gronau and London assumptions: the
single weak phase $\alpha$ just in the $\Delta I=3/2$ amplitudes, the isospin
relations and experimental data. Beside those analyses, we extract $\alpha$
through the use of several adequate parametrizations, showing that there is no
relevant discrepancy between frequentist and bayesian results. The most
relevant information, in terms of $\alpha$, is the exclusion of values around
$\alpha\sim \pi/4$; this result is valid in the presence of arbitrary New
Physics contributions to the $\Delta I=1/2$ piece.

analysing the HI and the HeII opacity variations separately, no transverse
proximity effect is detected near three foreground quasars of HE2347-4342:
QSOJ23503-4328 (z=2.282, $\vartheta=3.59$ arcmin), QSOJ23500-4319 (z=2.302,
$\vartheta=8.77$ arcmin) and QSOJ23495-4338 (z=2.690, $\vartheta=16.28$
arcmin). This is primarily due to line contamination and overdensities probably
created by large-scale structure. By comparing the HI absorption and the
corresponding HeII absorption, we estimated the fluctuating spectral shape of
the extragalactic UV radiation field along this line of sight. We find that the
UV spectral shape near HE2347-4342 and in the projected vicinity of the three
foreground quasars is statistically harder than expected from UV background
models dominated by quasars. In addition, we find three highly ionised metal
line systems near the quasars. However, they do not yield further constraints
on the shape of the ionising field. We conclude that the foreground quasars
show a transverse proximity effect that is detectable as a local hardening of
the UV radiation field, although the evidence is strongest for QSOJ23495-4338.
Thus, the relative spectral hardness traces the proximity effect also in
overdense regions prohibiting the traditional detection in the HI forest.

transfer in the intergalactic medium is important to understand the observed
spectral shape variations. From the transverse proximity effect of

We found that the absorbed spectra of the gas was quite different from that of the other side, which indicated that the absorbed spectra were different. We conclude that this phenomenon was an important tool for the study of the gas in the intergalactic medium, and the influence of nearby galaxies on its development.

","He had been captivated by the idea that the group structure of the group could be extended to the monoids, thus opening up a new avenue of inquiry into its mathematical properties. The present study reveals the novel connection between the groups of Richard Thompson and monomorphic theory. We are interested in the development of general generalizations of the groups of Richard Thompson, with the aim of extending their group structure to the monoids, and to provide a new angle of view of their mathematical properties. In our work we have developed generalized Thompson monoids, i.e., the group structure of the group, i.e., its finite generation and its finite presentation. This research, which has been done, leads us to find the relations of these monoids with other monomorphic structures, such as the Brandt ones. We are trying to develop a new way of understanding the nature of these groups, by comparing them with other monomorphic groups. We have found that there is no such thing as a universal isomorphism, which means that we can distinguish different monomorphic groups.

physical process concerned as exactly as possible without any approximation.
  From the comparison between the zenith angle distributon of the emitted muons
under [the SK assumption on the direction] and the corresponding one obtained
under our [Time Sequential Simulation], it is concluded that the measurement of
the direction of the incident neutrino for the neutrino events occurring inside
the detector in the SK analysis turns out to be unreliable, which holds
irrespective of the existence and/or non-existence of the neutrino oscillation.
","In order to test the accuracy of the fluxes, we studied the results of Monte Carlo simulations of the semi-elastic, and compared the fluxes of the proton to the true direction. Our findings show that the fluxes of the proton can be reliably guessed in a fully-elastic event at an angle of less than one degree, but that in the partially-elastic cases, where a small fraction of the energy passes through the detector, it becomes more difficult to obtain the proper direction for the sub-elastic. The study thus contributes to the study of neutrino physics and has important implications for the future of neutrino experiments. This study has been carried out in the interest of the researchers, and has provided a foundation for the study of neutrino physics. The main purpose of this study is to increase the accuracy of the neutrino oscillation measurement. To achieve this goal, we use Monte Carlo simulations to simulate the quasi-elastic event and compare the observed and the true direction of the emitted neutrino to the true direction.

function in as yet unexplored fashion. Our analysis of the complete Protein
Data Bank reveals several new knots which, along with previously discovered
ones, can shed light on such connections. In particular, we identify the most
complex knot discovered to date in human ubiquitin hydrolase, and suggest that
its entangled topology protects it against unfolding and degradation by the
proteasome. Knots in proteins are typically preserved across species and
sometimes even across kingdoms. However, we also identify a knot which only
appears in some transcarbamylases while being absent in homologous proteins of
similar structure. The emergence of the knot is accompanied by a shift in the
enzymatic function of the protein. We suggest that the simple insertion of a
short DNA fragment into the gene may suffice to turn an unknotted into a
knotted structure in this protein.

different aspects of the relation between the ordinary Schroedinger theory and
the polymer description. The paper has two parts. In the first one, we derive
the polymer quantum mechanics starting from the ordinary Schroedinger theory
and show that the polymer description arises as an appropriate limit. In the
second part we consider the continuum limit of this theory, namely, the reverse
process in which one starts from the discrete theory and tries to recover back
the ordinary Schroedinger quantum mechanics. We consider several examples of

the properties of the resulting high confidence set of YSO's. We find 235 such
objects in the 0.85 deg^2 field that was covered with both IRAC and MIPS. An
additional set of 51 lower confidence YSO's outside this area is identified
from the MIPS data combined with 2MASS photometry. We describe two sets of
results, color-color diagrams to compare our observed source properties with
those of theoretical models for star/disk/envelope systems and our own modeling
of the subset of our objects that appear to be star+disks. These objects
exhibit a very wide range of disk properties, from many that can be fit with
actively accreting disks to some with both passive disks and even possibly
debris disks. We find that the luminosity function of YSO's in Serpens extends
down to at least a few x .001 Lsun or lower for an assumed distance of 260 pc.
The lower limit may be set by our inability to distinguish YSO's from
extra-galactic sources more than by the lack of YSO's at very low luminosities.
A spatial clustering analysis shows that the nominally less-evolved YSO's are
more highly clustered than the later stages and that the background
extra-galactic population can be fit by the same two-point correlation function
as seen in other extra-galactic studies. We also present a table of matches
between several previous infrared and X-ray studies of the Serpens YSO
population and our Spitzer data set.

in quiescence during 1991 and 2001 are presented. Spin-modulated radial
velocities consistent with an outer disc origin were detected for the first
time in an IP. The spin pulsation was modulated with velocities near ~500-600
km/s. These velocities are consistent with those of material circulating at the
outer edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretion
curtain with material near the Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Doppler
tomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extending
from velocities of ~500 km/s to ~1000 km/s. These findings have confirmed the
theoretical model predictions of King & Wynn (1999), Belle et al. (2002) and
Norton et al. (2004) for EX Hya, which predict large accretion curtains that
extend to a distance close to the Roche lobe radius in this system. Evidence
for overflow stream of material falling onto the magnetosphere was observed,
confirming the result of Belle et al. (2005) that disc overflow in EX Hya is
present during quiescence as well as outburst. It appears that the hbeta and
hgamma spin radial velocities originated from the rotation of the funnel at the
outer disc edge, while those of halpha were produced due to the flow of
material along the field lines far from the white dwarf (narrow component) and
close to the white dwarf (broad-base component), in agreement with the

equations with non-commutative vector fields whose solution evolves on a smooth

along the manifold, we pull back the stochastic flow on the manifold to the Lie
group via the action, and subsequently pull back the flow to the corresponding
Lie algebra via the exponential map. We construct an approximation to the
stochastic flow in the Lie algebra via closed operations and then push back to
the Lie group and then to the manifold, thus ensuring our approximation lies in
the manifold. We call such schemes stochastic Munthe-Kaas methods after their
deterministic counterparts. We also present stochastic Lie group integration
schemes based on Castell--Gaines methods. These involve using an underlying
ordinary differential integrator to approximate the flow generated by a
truncated stochastic exponential Lie series. They become stochastic Lie group
integrator schemes if we use Munthe-Kaas methods as the underlying ordinary
differential integrator. Further, we show that some Castell--Gaines methods are
uniformly more accurate than the corresponding stochastic Taylor schemes.
Lastly we demonstrate our methods by simulating the dynamics of a free rigid
body such as a satellite and an autonomous underwater vehicle both perturbed by
two independent multiplicative stochastic noise processes.

with a sophisticated dynamic model of the solar chromosphere due to Carlsson
and Stein demonstrate that millimeter emission is extremely sensitive to
dynamic processes in the chromosphere and the appropriate wavelengths to look
for dynamic signatures are in the range 0.8-5.0 mm. The model also suggests
that high resolution observations at mm wavelengths, as will be provided by
ALMA, will have the unique property of reacting to both the hot and the cool
gas, and thus will have the potential of distinguishing between rival models of
the solar atmosphere. Thus, initial results obtained from the observations of
the quiet Sun at 3.5 mm with the BIMA array (resolution of 12 arcsec) reveal
significant oscillations with amplitudes of 50-150 K and frequencies of 1.5-8
mHz with a tendency toward short-period oscillations in internetwork and longer
periods in network regions. However higher spatial resolution, such as that
provided by ALMA, is required for a clean separation between the features
within the solar atmosphere and for an adequate comparison with the output of
the comprehensive dynamic simulations.

special attention to the inclusion of NSI-induced resonant conversions, which
may take place in the most deleptonised inner layers. We study the possibility
of detecting NSI effects in a Megaton water Cherenkov detector, either through
modulation effects in the $\bar\nu_e$ spectrum due to (i) the passage of shock
waves through the SN envelope, (ii) the time dependence of the electron
fraction and (iii) the Earth matter effects; or, finally, through the possible
detectability of the neutronization $\nu_e$ burst. We find that the $\bar\nu_e$
spectrum can exhibit dramatic features due to the internal NSI-induced resonant
conversion. This occurs for non-universal NSI strengths of a few %, and for
very small flavor-changing NSI above a few$\times 10^{-5}$.

for present precise determinations of \pi\pi scattering. Recently, Yndur\'ain,
using an Omn\`es representation of the null isospin(I) non-strange pion scalar
form factor, obtains \la r^2\ra^\pi_s=0.75\pm 0.07 fm^2. This value is larger
than the one calculated by solving the corresponding Muskhelishvili-Omn\`es

values, given the precision, then results. We reanalyze Yndur\'ain's method and
show that by imposing continuity of the resulting pion scalar form factor under
tiny changes in the input \pi\pi phase shifts, a zero in the form factor for
some S-wave I=0 T-matrices is then required. Once this is accounted for, the
resulting value is \la r^2\ra_s^\pi=0.65\pm 0.05 fm^2. The main source of error
in our determination is present experimental uncertainties in low energy S-wave
I=0 \pi\pi phase shifts. Another important contribution to our error is the not
yet settled asymptotic behaviour of the phase of the scalar form factor from
QCD.

of nonequilibrium entropy limiter schemes is to transform a field of a scalar

based on restriction of nonequilibrium entropy (entropy ""trimming"") and (ii)
based on filtering of nonequilibrium entropy (entropy filtering). The physical
properties of LBM provide some additional benefits: the control of entropy
production and accurate estimate of introduced artificial dissipation are
possible. The constructed limiters are tested on classical numerical examples:
1D athermal shock tubes with an initial density ratio 1:2 and the 2D lid-driven

plasmas (solar wind, interstellar medium, galaxy clusters, accretion disks).
The key assumptions are that the turbulence is anisotropic with respect to the
mean magnetic field and frequencies are low compared to the ion cyclotron
frequency. The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted
into heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETIC
CASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and
velocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each of
the physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematically
reduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the ""inertial range"" above the
ion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenic
fluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisional
and collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,
which obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated
with the Alfvenic component. In the ""dissipation range"" between the ion and
electron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave
(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive
phase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings the
energy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionless
wave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the
phase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at the
electron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scaling
relations are derived for these cascades. Astrophysical and space-physical
applications are discussed in detail.

Chezy law, but also importantly, to study the effects of these factors on the
propagation of undular bores, which are essentially unsteady in the system
under consideration. In particular, it is shown that the combined action of
variable topography and bottom friction generally imposes certain global
restrictions on the undular bore propagation so that the evolution of the
leading solitary wave can be substantially different from that of an isolated
solitary wave with the same initial amplitude. This non-local effect is due to
nonlinear wave interactions within the undular bore and can lead to an
additional solitary wave amplitude growth, which cannot be predicted in the
framework of the traditional adiabatic approach to the propagation of solitary
waves in slowly varying media.

accuracy achieved by the intelligent locator is comparable to that obtained by

combinatorics of puzzles while the stability property was not apparent from

of all Heisenberg equations. The simultaneous fulfillment of the Heisenberg

solved via a redefinition of the dynamical variables, similar to the normal
ordering procedure and containing it as a special case. That implies
corresponding changes in the admissible commutation relations. The introduction
of the concept of the vacuum makes narrow the class of the possible commutation
relations; in particular, the mentioned redefinition of the dynamical variables
is reduced to normal ordering. As a last restriction on that class is imposed
the requirement for existing of an effective procedure for calculating vacuum
mean values. The standard bilinear commutation relations are pointed as the
only known ones that satisfy all of the mentioned conditions and do not
contradict to the existing data.

nanostructured optoelectronic and electronic devices such as lasers,
photodetectors and nanoscale logic. Spatial order and size order of SAQDs are
important to the development of usable devices. It is likely that these two
types of order are strongly linked; thus, a study of spatial order will also
have strong implications for size order. Here a study of spatial order is
undertaken using a linear analysis of a commonly used model of SAQD formation
based on surface diffusion. Analytic formulas for film-height correlation
functions are found that characterize quantum dot spatial order and
corresponding correlation lengths that quantify order. Initial atomic-scale
random fluctuations result in relatively small correlation lengths (about two
dots) when the effect of a wetting potential is negligible; however, the
correlation lengths diverge when SAQDs are allowed to form at a near-critical
film height. The present work reinforces previous findings about anisotropy and
SAQD order and presents as explicit and transparent mechanism for ordering with
corresponding analytic equations. In addition, SAQD formation is by its nature
a stochastic process, and various mathematical aspects regarding statistical
analysis of SAQD formation and order are presented.

result that takes advantage of differences in rates of expansion in the terms
of a sheaf cohomological long exact sequence to create unique lifts of finite
dimensional invariant subspaces of one term of the sequence to invariant
subspaces of the preceding term. This allows us to take invariant cohomological
classes and under the right circumstances construct unique currents of a given
type, including unique measures of a given type, that represent those classes
and are invariant under pullback. A dynamically interesting self map may have a
plethora of invariant measures, so the uniquess of the constructed currents is
important. It means that if local growth is not too big compared to the growth
rate of the cohomological class then the expanding cohomological class gives
sufficient ""marching orders"" to the system to prohibit the formation of any
other such invariant current of the same type (say from some local dynamical
subsystem). Because we use subsheaves of the sheaf of currents we give
conditions under which a subsheaf will have the same cohomology as the sheaf
containing it. Using a smoothing argument this allows us to show that the sheaf
cohomology of the currents under consideration can be canonically identified
with the deRham cohomology groups. Our main theorem can be applied in both the
smooth and holomorphic setting.

These currents, called Cohomological Currents, are derived from the property that the correlations of the CEMs are decayed.

depends on cluster half-mass density (rho_h) in the sense that the turnover
mass M_TO increases with rho_h while the width of the GCMF decreases. We argue
that this is the expected signature of the slow erosion of a mass function that
initially rose towards low masses, predominantly through cluster evaporation
driven by internal two-body relaxation. We find excellent agreement between the
observed GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, central
concentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model in
which the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by
-dM/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1/2}. In particular, we recover the well-known
insensitivity of M_TO to r_gc. This feature does not derive from a literal
``universality'' of the GCMF turnover mass, but rather from a significant
variation of M_TO with rho_h -- the expected outcome of relaxation-driven
cluster disruption -- plus significant scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc.
Our conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are assumed to depend
instead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidal
radii, as mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1/2} or mu_ev ~ Sigma_t^{3/4} -- alternative
prescriptions that are physically motivated but involve cluster properties
(rho_t and Sigma_t) that are not as well defined or as readily observable as
rho_h. In all cases, the normalization of mu_ev required to fit the GCMF
implies cluster lifetimes that are within the range of standard values
(although falling towards the low end of this range). Our analysis does not
depend on any assumptions or information about velocity anisotropy in the
globular cluster system.

vanishing boundary conditions. One-soliton solutions are derived in an explicit
manner. According to the behaviors at the infinity, they are classified into
two kinds, domain-wall (DW) type and phase-shift (PS) type. The DW-type implies
the ferromagnetic state with nonzero total spin and the PS-type implies the
polar state, where the total spin amounts to zero. We also discuss two-soliton
collisions. In particular, the spin-mixing phenomenon is confirmed in a
collision involving the DW-type. The results are consistent with those of the

additional term describing bulk energy losses due to inelastic collisions. We
employ Lagrangian coordinates and derive a broad family of exact non-stationary
analytical solutions that depend only on one spatial coordinate. These
solutions exhibit a new type of singularity, where the gas density blows up in
a finite time when starting from smooth initial conditions. The density blowups
signal formation of close-packed clusters of particles. As the density blow-up
time $t_c$ is approached, the maximum density exhibits a power law $\sim
(t_c-t)^{-2}$. The velocity gradient blows up as $\sim - (t_c-t)^{-1}$ while
the velocity itself remains continuous and develops a cusp (rather than a shock
discontinuity) at the singularity. The gas temperature vanishes at the
singularity, and the singularity follows the isobaric scenario: the gas
pressure remains finite and approximately uniform in space and constant in time
close to the singularity. An additional exact solution shows that the density
blowup, of the same type, may coexist with an ""ordinary"" shock, at which the
hydrodynamic fields are discontinuous but finite. We confirm stability of the
exact solutions with respect to small one-dimensional perturbations by solving
the ideal hydrodynamic equations numerically. Furthermore, numerical solutions
show that the local features of the density blowup hold universally,

configurations, called universal sector, turns out to be same around all the
pp-waves, even off-shell, with same transverse space and same profiles for the
background scalars. In this paper we restrict our discussion to tensorial
fields only. In the context of bosonic string theory we consider on-shell
pp-waves and argue that universality requires the existence of a universal
sector of world-sheet operators whose correlation functions are insensitive to
the pp-wave nature of the metric and the background gauge flux. Such results
can also be reproduced using the world-sheet conformal field theory. We also
study such pp-waves in non-polynomial closed string field theory (CSFT). In
particular, we argue that for an off-shell pp-wave ansatz with flat transverse
space and dilaton independent of transverse coordinates the field redefinition
relating the low energy effective field theory and CSFT with all the massive
modes integrated out is at most quadratic in fields. Because of this
simplification it is expected that the off-shell pp-waves can be identified on
the two sides. Furthermore, given the massless pp-wave field configurations, an
iterative method for computing the higher massive modes using the CSFT
equations of motion has been discussed. All our bosonic string theory analyses
can be generalised to the common Neveu-Schwarz sector of superstrings.

V_{DM}~ 4500km/s ~ V_{gas} would invoke unrealistic large amount M_{CDM}=7x
10^{15}Msun of CDM for a cluster containing only ~ 10^{14}Msun of gas. Our
results are generalisable beyond General Relativity, e.g., a speed of
$4500\kms$ is easily obtained in the relativistic MONDian lensing model of
Angus et al. (2007). However, MONDian model with little hot dark matter

1\times 10^{15}\msun$ are barely consistent with lensing and velocity data.

The data from the Hubble space telescope and the Chandra X-ray observatory are used to study the properties of the clusters and the evolution of the clusters. The results show that the collision occurred only recently, with the colliding cluster moving at an average speed of over 4700 km/s. The analysis shows that the collision was only slight and that the gravity of the colliding cluster did not slow it down, which meant that the collision was not impeded. Our work is based on the observation of multiple wavelengths of the X-ray observatory and the Chandra X-ray observatory.

not negligible for realistic kinematics and finite medium size. The

nearly extremal Kerr black hole. For very rapidly rotating black holes (spin
a=J/M>0.9524M) we have found a class of very strong field eccentric orbits
whose angular momentum L_z increases with the orbit's inclination with respect
to the equatorial plane, while keeping latus rectum and eccentricity fixed.
This behavior is in contrast with Newtonian intuition, and is in fact opposite
to the ""normal"" behavior of black hole orbits. Such behavior was noted
previously for circular orbits; since it only applies to orbits very close to
the black hole, they were named ""nearly horizon-skimming orbits"". Our analysis
generalizes this result, mapping out the full generic (inclined and eccentric)
family of nearly horizon-skimming orbits. The earlier work on circular orbits
reported that, under gravitational radiation emission, nearly horizon-skimming
orbits tend to evolve to smaller orbit inclination, toward prograde equatorial
configuration. Normal orbits, by contrast, always demonstrate slowly growing
orbit inclination (orbits evolve toward the retrograde equatorial
configuration). Using up-to-date Teukolsky-fluxes, we have concluded that the
earlier result was incorrect: all circular orbits, including nearly
horizon-skimming ones, exhibit growing orbit inclination. Using kludge fluxes
based on a Post-Newtonian expansion corrected with fits to circular and to
equatorial Teukolsky-fluxes, we argue that the inclination grows also for
eccentric nearly horizon-skimming orbits. We also find that the inclination
change is, in any case, very small. As such, we conclude that these orbits are
not likely to have a clear and peculiar imprint on the gravitational waveforms
expected to be measured by the space-based detector LISA.
","To make this work we employed two methods of calculating the behavior of orbits around the horizon. The first is a perturbation technique to study the behavior of orbits which approach the horizon. Then we investigate the effects of eccentricity and inclination on the behavior of orbits. This study provides new insights into the behavior of orbits near the horizon, and thus may be of great interest to the understanding of black hole dynamics and accretion. In this study we have analyzed the properties of orbits near the horizon. We have found that circular orbits near the horizon can be chaotic, due to the strong gravitational field around the black hole. In addition, we have found that non-circular orbits can be subjected to substantial energy dissipation, and which could have important consequences for astrophysics, such as accretion disks. We study a number of interesting phenomena, which are related to the orbits near the horizon, and the behavior of orbits around the horizon.

circulation, superfluids are irrotational, and any rotation or angular momentum
is constrained to occur through vortices with quantized circulation. Quantized
vortices also play a key role in the dissipation of transport in superfluids.
In BECs quantized vortices have been observed in several forms, including
single vortices, vortex lattices, and vortex pairs and rings. The recent
observation of quantized vortices in a fermionic gas was taken as a clear
signature of the underlying condensation and superfluidity of fermion pairs. In
addition to BECs, quantized vortices also occur in superfluid Helium, nonlinear
optics, and type-II superconductors.

dephasing can be much more efficient than spin relaxation at high temperature,

the thermodynamic properties. The local magnetic moments, spin correlation
functions, and static structure factors are discussed in the ground state for

at wavevectors $q=a\pi /3$ (a=0,1,2,3,4,5) for different couplings in a zero

plateau with m=1/6 pertains, exhibits the peaks only at q=0, $2\pi /3$ and
$4\pi /3$, which are found to be couplings-independent. The DMRG results of the
zero-field static structure factor can be nicely fitted by a linear
superposition of six modes, where two fitting equations are proposed. It is
observed that the six modes are closely related to the low-lying excitations of
the system. At finite temperatures, the double-peak structures of the

With the number of experiments the redundancy on average increases, while the
experimental information converges to a certain limit value. The difference
between this limit value and the experimental information at a finite number of
data represents the discrepancy between the experimentally determined and the
true properties of the phenomenon. The sum of the discrepancy measure and the
redundancy is utilized as a cost function. By its minimum a reasonable number
of data for the extraction of the law yo(x) is specified. The mutual
information is defined by the marginal and the conditional PDFs of the
variables. The ratio between mutual information and marginal information is
used to indicate which variable is the independent one. The properties of the
introduced statistics are demonstrated on deterministically and randomly
related variables.
","Our project aimed to extract physical laws from the data of joint experiments, and to evaluate them against the predictions of analytical models. Our approach was based on the principle that the physical laws of the world were governed by fundamental laws, which are difficult to estimate because of their complexity or their impossibility. Therefore, we thought that we could apply a new method of machine learning to extract the laws of physical experiments. We have previously used analytical methods to derive the laws of physical experiments from a purely mathematical form. These methods are limited to simple models, but our method reveals that the physical laws are obtained by machine learning from experimental data without any knowledge of the mathematical relationships involved. This is a promising new method for physics, which is increasingly important for analyzing complex physical phenomena. We use a novel method of eliciting physical laws from the joint experimental data.

complexity of a natural phenomenon and the proper number of experiments needed

entropy of information pertaining to the probability density function of

integration over a range of variables, an approximate expression for redundancy
is derived that includes only a sum over the set of experimental data about
these variables. The approximation makes feasible an efficient estimation of
the redundancy of data along with the related experimental information and

foliation on $M$, with isolated singularities of Morse type. The study and
classification of pairs $(M,\F)$ is a challenging (and difficult) problem. In
this setting, a classical result due to Reeb \cite{Reeb} states that a manifold
admitting a foliation with exactly two center-type singularities is a sphere.
In particular this is true if the foliation is given by a function. Along these
lines a result due to Eells and Kuiper \cite{Ku-Ee} classify manifolds having a
real-valued function admitting exactly three non-degenerate singular points. In
the present paper, we prove a generalization of the above mentioned results. To
do this, we first describe the possible arrangements of pairs of singularities
and the corresponding codimension one invariant sets, and then we give an
elimination procedure for suitable center-saddle and some saddle-saddle
configurations (of consecutive indices). In the second part, we investigate if
other classical results, such as Haefliger and Novikov (Compact Leaf) theorems,
proved for regular foliations, still hold true in presence of singularities. At
this purpose, in the singular set, $Sing(\F)$ of the foliation $\F$, we
consider {\em{weakly stable}} components, that we define as those components
admitting a neighborhood where all leaves are compact. If $Sing(\F)$ admits
only weakly stable components, given by smoothly embedded curves diffeomorphic
to $S^1$, we are able to extend Haefliger's theorem. Finally, the existence of
a closed curve, transverse to the foliation, leads us to state a Novikov-type
result.
","In addition, we investigate the relationship between the singularities and the topology, particularly the cohomology and homotopy groups. The results are: the classification of smooth foliated foliations up to isotopy. The classification of foliated foliations to isotopy is based on the bifurcation diagrams of the foliated foliations, and on the intersections of them. It can be used to discover and study the dynamics of foliated foliations. In our research, we are primarily interested in the properties of smooth foliated foliations with Morse. We also discuss the relation between the types and the properties of the morsel, and the cohomology and homotopy. The motivation for this research lies in the fact that such foliations are widespread in many physical and mathematical systems, and their emergence often leads to the formation of topological and dynamical morphologies.

controversial from a statistical point of view, as the frequentist vs. bayesian

deserved full attention and pervade the extraction of $\alpha$.
Reparametrization Invariance proves appropriate to understand those issues. We
show that some Standard Model inspired parametrizations can be senseless or
inadequate if they go beyond the minimal Gronau and London assumptions: the
single weak phase $\alpha$ just in the $\Delta I=3/2$ amplitudes, the isospin
relations and experimental data. Beside those analyses, we extract $\alpha$
through the use of several adequate parametrizations, showing that there is no
relevant discrepancy between frequentist and bayesian results. The most
relevant information, in terms of $\alpha$, is the exclusion of values around
$\alpha\sim \pi/4$; this result is valid in the presence of arbitrary New
Physics contributions to the $\Delta I=1/2$ piece.
","We study the effects of reparametrization in the extraction of alpha from the decay of B to Pi-pi-pi.

of the molecular junction with closed structure under a small bias voltage are
mainly determined by the tail of the transmission peak contributed unusually by

the two quasars whose intergalactic HeII forest has been resolved with FUSE. By
analysing the HI and the HeII opacity variations separately, no transverse
proximity effect is detected near three foreground quasars of HE2347-4342:
QSOJ23503-4328 (z=2.282, $\vartheta=3.59$ arcmin), QSOJ23500-4319 (z=2.302,
$\vartheta=8.77$ arcmin) and QSOJ23495-4338 (z=2.690, $\vartheta=16.28$
arcmin). This is primarily due to line contamination and overdensities probably
created by large-scale structure. By comparing the HI absorption and the
corresponding HeII absorption, we estimated the fluctuating spectral shape of
the extragalactic UV radiation field along this line of sight. We find that the
UV spectral shape near HE2347-4342 and in the projected vicinity of the three
foreground quasars is statistically harder than expected from UV background
models dominated by quasars. In addition, we find three highly ionised metal
line systems near the quasars. However, they do not yield further constraints
on the shape of the ionising field. We conclude that the foreground quasars
show a transverse proximity effect that is detectable as a local hardening of
the UV radiation field, although the evidence is strongest for QSOJ23495-4338.
Thus, the relative spectral hardness traces the proximity effect also in
overdense regions prohibiting the traditional detection in the HI forest.
Furthermore, we emphasise that softening of quasar radiation by radiative
transfer in the intergalactic medium is important to understand the observed
spectral shape variations. From the transverse proximity effect of
QSOJ23495-4338 we obtain a lower limit on the quasar lifetime of ~25 Myr.
","The result was that the spectral hardness of the absorbed gas was systematically different on either side of the quasar, which indicated that the transverse proximity of the gas was altering the physical properties of the gas in question.

its entangled topology protects it against unfolding and degradation by the

sometimes even across kingdoms. However, we also identify a knot which only
appears in some transcarbamylases while being absent in homologous proteins of
similar structure. The emergence of the knot is accompanied by a shift in the
enzymatic function of the protein. We suggest that the simple insertion of a
short DNA fragment into the gene may suffice to turn an unknotted into a
knotted structure in this protein.

We will investigate the structure of a path in polymer chains, and in the continuum limit, we will give a good idea of how far it can be stretched. We will give a good idea of the relationship between the network and the pattern. The relationship between the two is studied. In this paper, we are addressing the continuum limit of polymer mechanics. We investigate the relationship of the strands to the pattern. In the configuration space, there is a continuous path, and the polymer should display a continuum. We have shown that the spatial variable in this space is quite possible, when stretched out a long distance. In this work, we study the connection of the strands.

observations of the Serpens star-forming region. In particular we present a set
of criteria for isolating bona fide young stellar objects, YSO's, from the
extensive background contamination by extra-galactic objects. We then discuss
the properties of the resulting high confidence set of YSO's. We find 235 such
objects in the 0.85 deg^2 field that was covered with both IRAC and MIPS. An
additional set of 51 lower confidence YSO's outside this area is identified
from the MIPS data combined with 2MASS photometry. We describe two sets of
results, color-color diagrams to compare our observed source properties with
those of theoretical models for star/disk/envelope systems and our own modeling
of the subset of our objects that appear to be star+disks. These objects
exhibit a very wide range of disk properties, from many that can be fit with
actively accreting disks to some with both passive disks and even possibly
debris disks. We find that the luminosity function of YSO's in Serpens extends
down to at least a few x .001 Lsun or lower for an assumed distance of 260 pc.
The lower limit may be set by our inability to distinguish YSO's from
extra-galactic sources more than by the lack of YSO's at very low luminosities.
A spatial clustering analysis shows that the nominally less-evolved YSO's are
more highly clustered than the later stages and that the background
extra-galactic population can be fit by the same two-point correlation function
as seen in other extra-galactic studies. We also present a table of matches
between several previous infrared and X-ray studies of the Serpens YSO
population and our Spitzer data set.
","This study is important for the study of the formation and evolution of the stars. We propose to analyze the Serpens tepidus, an occupied region near the star forming, as a study subject. The Serpens tepidus is a region of tepidus, a near star, so that it is a convenient target for study of the formation and development of planetary systems. In this study, we present the results of our work on the Serpens tepidus, a region where star formation is underway, and we want to make a comprehensive study of the tepidus. Our approach consists of a color-coded spectra of the tepidus, a physical model, and a spatial and temporal analysis of the tepidus. We obtained 581 tepidus from the Serpens cloud, of which some of them are of the I and some of the II classes. Our results show that YSOs are unevenly distributed across the cloud, and that the highest concentrations are in the central cluster, and that there are, however, several tepidus populations in different parts of the cloud.

in quiescence during 1991 and 2001 are presented. Spin-modulated radial
velocities consistent with an outer disc origin were detected for the first
time in an IP. The spin pulsation was modulated with velocities near ~500-600
km/s. These velocities are consistent with those of material circulating at the
outer edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretion
curtain with material near the Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Doppler
tomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extending
from velocities of ~500 km/s to ~1000 km/s. These findings have confirmed the
theoretical model predictions of King & Wynn (1999), Belle et al. (2002) and
Norton et al. (2004) for EX Hya, which predict large accretion curtains that
extend to a distance close to the Roche lobe radius in this system. Evidence
for overflow stream of material falling onto the magnetosphere was observed,
confirming the result of Belle et al. (2005) that disc overflow in EX Hya is
present during quiescence as well as outburst. It appears that the hbeta and
hgamma spin radial velocities originated from the rotation of the funnel at the
outer disc edge, while those of halpha were produced due to the flow of
material along the field lines far from the white dwarf (narrow component) and
close to the white dwarf (broad-base component), in agreement with the
accretion curtain model.

equations with non-commutative vector fields whose solution evolves on a smooth

along the manifold, we pull back the stochastic flow on the manifold to the Lie
group via the action, and subsequently pull back the flow to the corresponding
Lie algebra via the exponential map. We construct an approximation to the
stochastic flow in the Lie algebra via closed operations and then push back to
the Lie group and then to the manifold, thus ensuring our approximation lies in
the manifold. We call such schemes stochastic Munthe-Kaas methods after their
deterministic counterparts. We also present stochastic Lie group integration
schemes based on Castell--Gaines methods. These involve using an underlying
ordinary differential integrator to approximate the flow generated by a
truncated stochastic exponential Lie series. They become stochastic Lie group
integrator schemes if we use Munthe-Kaas methods as the underlying ordinary
differential integrator. Further, we show that some Castell--Gaines methods are
uniformly more accurate than the corresponding stochastic Taylor schemes.
Lastly we demonstrate our methods by simulating the dynamics of a free rigid
body such as a satellite and an autonomous underwater vehicle both perturbed by
two independent multiplicative stochastic noise processes.
","A recurrent problem in the computation of the differential equations of Lie groups, which are usually encountered in a number of applications, has caused it to be difficult to solve. The Euler-Maruyama method, for instance, does not preserve the geometrical structure of Lie groups, which causes errors in time, and which are eventually to be discovered. This method is of great use in the field of deterministic and control analysis, and has opened up new avenues for new applications in the fields of deterministic and control theory.

Here we point out the potential of chromospheric observations at millimeter
wavelengths to resolve this long-standing problem. Computations carried out
with a sophisticated dynamic model of the solar chromosphere due to Carlsson
and Stein demonstrate that millimeter emission is extremely sensitive to
dynamic processes in the chromosphere and the appropriate wavelengths to look
for dynamic signatures are in the range 0.8-5.0 mm. The model also suggests
that high resolution observations at mm wavelengths, as will be provided by
ALMA, will have the unique property of reacting to both the hot and the cool
gas, and thus will have the potential of distinguishing between rival models of
the solar atmosphere. Thus, initial results obtained from the observations of
the quiet Sun at 3.5 mm with the BIMA array (resolution of 12 arcsec) reveal
significant oscillations with amplitudes of 50-150 K and frequencies of 1.5-8
mHz with a tendency toward short-period oscillations in internetwork and longer
periods in network regions. However higher spatial resolution, such as that
provided by ALMA, is required for a clean separation between the features
within the solar atmosphere and for an adequate comparison with the output of
the comprehensive dynamic simulations.

propagation through the SN envelope within a three-neutrino framework, paying
special attention to the inclusion of NSI-induced resonant conversions, which
may take place in the most deleptonised inner layers. We study the possibility
of detecting NSI effects in a Megaton water Cherenkov detector, either through
modulation effects in the $\bar\nu_e$ spectrum due to (i) the passage of shock
waves through the SN envelope, (ii) the time dependence of the electron
fraction and (iii) the Earth matter effects; or, finally, through the possible
detectability of the neutronization $\nu_e$ burst. We find that the $\bar\nu_e$
spectrum can exhibit dramatic features due to the internal NSI-induced resonant
conversion. This occurs for non-universal NSI strengths of a few %, and for
very small flavor-changing NSI above a few$\times 10^{-5}$.

Our work is a proof of the importance of studying non-standard neutrino interactions in supernovae, and provides a framework for testing and configuring such interactions. The results show that NSI significantly affects the neutrino signal, and the deviations from the standard value are significant.

based on restriction of nonequilibrium entropy (entropy ""trimming"") and (ii)
based on filtering of nonequilibrium entropy (entropy filtering). The physical
properties of LBM provide some additional benefits: the control of entropy
production and accurate estimate of introduced artificial dissipation are

plasmas (solar wind, interstellar medium, galaxy clusters, accretion disks).
The key assumptions are that the turbulence is anisotropic with respect to the
mean magnetic field and frequencies are low compared to the ion cyclotron
frequency. The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted
into heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETIC
CASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and
velocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each of
the physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematically
reduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the ""inertial range"" above the
ion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenic
fluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisional
and collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,
which obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated
with the Alfvenic component. In the ""dissipation range"" between the ion and
electron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave
(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive
phase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings the
energy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionless
wave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the
phase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at the
electron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scaling
relations are derived for these cascades. Astrophysical and space-physical
applications are discussed in detail.

periodic waves over a gradual slope with bottom friction in the framework of a

method, using a recent development of this theory for perturbed integrable
equations. This general approach enables us not only to improve known results
on the adiabatic evolution of isolated solitary waves and periodic wave trains
in the presence of variable topography and bottom friction, modeled by the
Chezy law, but also importantly, to study the effects of these factors on the
propagation of undular bores, which are essentially unsteady in the system
under consideration. In particular, it is shown that the combined action of
variable topography and bottom friction generally imposes certain global
restrictions on the undular bore propagation so that the evolution of the
leading solitary wave can be substantially different from that of an isolated
solitary wave with the same initial amplitude. This non-local effect is due to
nonlinear wave interactions within the undular bore and can lead to an
additional solitary wave amplitude growth, which cannot be predicted in the
framework of the traditional adiabatic approach to the propagation of solitary
waves in slowly varying media.

a difficult problem of non-destructive testing. This article describes an
intelligent acoustic emission source locator. The intelligent locator comprises
a sensor antenna and a general regression neural network, which solves the
location problem based on learning from examples. Locator performance was
tested on different test specimens. Tests have shown that the accuracy of
location depends on sound velocity and attenuation in the specimen, the
dimensions of the tested area, and the properties of stored data. The location
accuracy achieved by the intelligent locator is comparable to that obtained by
the conventional triangulation method, while the applicability of the
intelligent locator is more general since analysis of sonic ray paths is
avoided. This is a promising method for non-destructive testing of aircraft
frame structures by the acoustic emission method.

accounted for by traditional semilocal density functional theory (DFT)

pure potassium atoms and graphite requires use of a description of the graphite
interlayer binding and thus a consistent account of the nonlocal dispersive
interactions. This is included seamlessly with ordinary DFT by a van der Waals
density functional (vdW-DF) approach [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 246401 (2004)]. The
use of the vdW-DF is found to stabilize the graphite crystal, with crystal
parameters in fair agreement with experiments. For graphite and
potassium-intercalated graphite structural parameters such as binding
separation, layer binding energy, formation energy, and bulk modulus are
reported. Also the adsorption and sub-surface potassium absorption energies are
reported. The vdW-DF description, compared with the traditional semilocal

an orbit indistinguishable from circular, $e=0.012 \pm 0.021$. We demonstrate
generally that the surface gravity of the secondary star in a single-lined
binary undergoing total eclipses can be derived from characteristics of the
light curve and spectroscopic orbit. This constrains the secondary to a unique
line in the mass-radius diagram with $M/R^2$ = constant. For HAT-TR-205-013, we
assume the orbit has been tidally circularized, and that the primary's rotation
has been synchronized and aligned with the orbital axis. Our observed line
broadening, $V_{\rm rot} \sin i_{\rm rot} = 28.9 \pm 1.0$ \kms, gives a primary
radius of $R_{\rm A} = 1.28 \pm 0.04$ \rsun. Our light curve analysis leads to
the radius of the secondary, $R_{\rm B} = 0.167 \pm 0.006$ \rsun, and the
semimajor axis of the orbit, $a = 7.54 \pm 0.30 \rsun = 0.0351 \pm 0.0014$ AU.

solved via a redefinition of the dynamical variables, similar to the normal

undertaken using a linear analysis of a commonly used model of SAQD formation

functions are found that characterize quantum dot spatial order and
corresponding correlation lengths that quantify order. Initial atomic-scale
random fluctuations result in relatively small correlation lengths (about two

correlation lengths diverge when SAQDs are allowed to form at a near-critical
film height. The present work reinforces previous findings about anisotropy and
SAQD order and presents as explicit and transparent mechanism for ordering with
corresponding analytic equations. In addition, SAQD formation is by its nature
a stochastic process, and various mathematical aspects regarding statistical

result that takes advantage of differences in rates of expansion in the terms
of a sheaf cohomological long exact sequence to create unique lifts of finite
dimensional invariant subspaces of one term of the sequence to invariant
subspaces of the preceding term. This allows us to take invariant cohomological
classes and under the right circumstances construct unique currents of a given
type, including unique measures of a given type, that represent those classes
and are invariant under pullback. A dynamically interesting self map may have a
plethora of invariant measures, so the uniquess of the constructed currents is
important. It means that if local growth is not too big compared to the growth
rate of the cohomological class then the expanding cohomological class gives
sufficient ""marching orders"" to the system to prohibit the formation of any
other such invariant current of the same type (say from some local dynamical
subsystem). Because we use subsheaves of the sheaf of currents we give
conditions under which a subsheaf will have the same cohomology as the sheaf
containing it. Using a smoothing argument this allows us to show that the sheaf
cohomology of the currents under consideration can be canonically identified
with the deRham cohomology groups. Our main theorem can be applied in both the
smooth and holomorphic setting.

depends on cluster half-mass density (rho_h) in the sense that the turnover
mass M_TO increases with rho_h while the width of the GCMF decreases. We argue
that this is the expected signature of the slow erosion of a mass function that
initially rose towards low masses, predominantly through cluster evaporation
driven by internal two-body relaxation. We find excellent agreement between the
observed GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, central
concentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model in
which the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by
-dM/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1/2}. In particular, we recover the well-known
insensitivity of M_TO to r_gc. This feature does not derive from a literal
``universality'' of the GCMF turnover mass, but rather from a significant
variation of M_TO with rho_h -- the expected outcome of relaxation-driven
cluster disruption -- plus significant scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc.
Our conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are assumed to depend
instead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidal
radii, as mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1/2} or mu_ev ~ Sigma_t^{3/4} -- alternative
prescriptions that are physically motivated but involve cluster properties
(rho_t and Sigma_t) that are not as well defined or as readily observable as
rho_h. In all cases, the normalization of mu_ev required to fit the GCMF
implies cluster lifetimes that are within the range of standard values
(although falling towards the low end of this range). Our analysis does not
depend on any assumptions or information about velocity anisotropy in the
globular cluster system.
","And in consequence, this is a method of interpreting the observational data on GCs, and forming a new model of the basic properties of the universe. The GCs are a complex system of old stars, and serve as a vital laboratory for studying the evolution of star clusters. In this work, we examine the influence of the two-body relaxation of individual stars on the mass function of a GC. Our research aims to explain the effects of the evaporation of stars from the outer regions of the GC and to explain the formation of the mass function of the GC. In this work, we investigate the impact of the two-body relaxation of stars by evaporation, and we find that the mass function of the GC changes a great deal in response to the excitation of stars from the outer regions. In this regard, we formulate a new theoretical model of the mass function of GCs and examine the fundamental properties of the universe. In our study, we investigate the mass function of globular clusters. The globular clusters are dense, old stars, which are a very important laboratory for the study of the galaxy and of the astronomy.

resulting soliton solutions can be regarded as a generalization of those under
vanishing boundary conditions. One-soliton solutions are derived in an explicit
manner. According to the behaviors at the infinity, they are classified into
two kinds, domain-wall (DW) type and phase-shift (PS) type. The DW-type implies
the ferromagnetic state with nonzero total spin and the PS-type implies the
polar state, where the total spin amounts to zero. We also discuss two-soliton
collisions. In particular, the spin-mixing phenomenon is confirmed in a
collision involving the DW-type. The results are consistent with those of the

clustering of particles in a freely cooling dilute granular gas. We consider
large-scale hydrodynamic motions where the viscosity and heat conduction can be
neglected, and one arrives at the equations of ideal gas dynamics with an
additional term describing bulk energy losses due to inelastic collisions. We
employ Lagrangian coordinates and derive a broad family of exact non-stationary
analytical solutions that depend only on one spatial coordinate. These
solutions exhibit a new type of singularity, where the gas density blows up in
a finite time when starting from smooth initial conditions. The density blowups
signal formation of close-packed clusters of particles. As the density blow-up
time $t_c$ is approached, the maximum density exhibits a power law $\sim
(t_c-t)^{-2}$. The velocity gradient blows up as $\sim - (t_c-t)^{-1}$ while
the velocity itself remains continuous and develops a cusp (rather than a shock
discontinuity) at the singularity. The gas temperature vanishes at the
singularity, and the singularity follows the isobaric scenario: the gas
pressure remains finite and approximately uniform in space and constant in time
close to the singularity. An additional exact solution shows that the density
blowup, of the same type, may coexist with an ""ordinary"" shock, at which the
hydrodynamic fields are discontinuous but finite. We confirm stability of the
exact solutions with respect to small one-dimensional perturbations by solving
the ideal hydrodynamic equations numerically. Furthermore, numerical solutions
show that the local features of the density blowup hold universally,
independently of details of the initial and boundary conditions.

space-time expanded around pp-wave backgrounds. According to this property the
space-time lagrangian density evaluated on a restricted set of field
configurations, called universal sector, turns out to be same around all the
pp-waves, even off-shell, with same transverse space and same profiles for the
background scalars. In this paper we restrict our discussion to tensorial
fields only. In the context of bosonic string theory we consider on-shell
pp-waves and argue that universality requires the existence of a universal
sector of world-sheet operators whose correlation functions are insensitive to
the pp-wave nature of the metric and the background gauge flux. Such results
can also be reproduced using the world-sheet conformal field theory. We also
study such pp-waves in non-polynomial closed string field theory (CSFT). In
particular, we argue that for an off-shell pp-wave ansatz with flat transverse
space and dilaton independent of transverse coordinates the field redefinition
relating the low energy effective field theory and CSFT with all the massive
modes integrated out is at most quadratic in fields. Because of this
simplification it is expected that the off-shell pp-waves can be identified on
the two sides. Furthermore, given the massless pp-wave field configurations, an
iterative method for computing the higher massive modes using the CSFT
equations of motion has been discussed. All our bosonic string theory analyses
can be generalised to the common Neveu-Schwarz sector of superstrings.

a future value of chaotic time series from the present one. The mean predictor
error is used in the definition of predictor quality, while the redundancy is
expressed by the mean square distance between data points. Both statistics are

coexisting SE states has been observed both in real physical experiments and in
computer simulations. This confirms the analytical estimations of the branching
density in the phase space. The nature of the refractority of SE pulses is
closely connected with the pointed branching and reflects the crises of strange
attractors, i.e. their collisions with unstable periodic components of the
higher branches of SE states in the nonautonomous microwave phonon laser.
","Our goal is to develop the nonlinear dynamics of phonon-generated waves in a resonant resonator that is driven by a nonlinear mechanism. This method of analysis is based on the Lang-Kobayashi model, which is based on the resonant behavior of a two-level laser system. This model consists of the resonant dynamics and the phonon-induced waves. We investigate the structure of the resonant and its phonon-induced waves. We are based on the concept of the resonant and the phonon-induced waves, which is the basis of the resonant. We propose a system whose resonant and the phonon-induced waves are coupled in a system with non-linear differential equations, and in which there are a variety of dynamics, including chaos, limit-cycles, and quasiperiodics. In this paper, we introduce the resonant and the phonon-induced waves, and show how to harness these resonators for a stable and stable microwave signal. Our goal is to study the non-linear dynamics of the resonator and the phonon-induced waves, and to show how this system can be used to produce a stable microwave signal.

quantitative measures of the magnetic phase fractions, and vortex nucleation

Bursts. Since bursts fade rapidly, it is desirable to create and disseminate

  Aims. To provide the community with an online repository of X-ray light
curves obtained with Swift. The light curves should be of the quality expected
of published data, but automatically created and updated so as to be
self-consistent and rapidly available. Methods. We have produced a suite of
programs which automatically generates Swift/XRT light curves of GRBs. Effects
of the damage to the CCD, automatic readout-mode switching and pile-up are
appropriately handled, and the data are binned with variable bin durations, as
necessary for a fading source.
  Results. The light curve repository website
(http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_curves) contains light curves, hardness ratios and
deep images for every GRB which Swift's XRT has observed. When new GRBs are
detected, light curves are created and updated within minutes of the data
arriving at the UK Swift Science Data Centre.

nearly extremal Kerr black hole. For very rapidly rotating black holes (spin
a=J/M>0.9524M) we have found a class of very strong field eccentric orbits
whose angular momentum L_z increases with the orbit's inclination with respect
to the equatorial plane, while keeping latus rectum and eccentricity fixed.
This behavior is in contrast with Newtonian intuition, and is in fact opposite
to the ""normal"" behavior of black hole orbits. Such behavior was noted
previously for circular orbits; since it only applies to orbits very close to
the black hole, they were named ""nearly horizon-skimming orbits"". Our analysis
generalizes this result, mapping out the full generic (inclined and eccentric)
family of nearly horizon-skimming orbits. The earlier work on circular orbits
reported that, under gravitational radiation emission, nearly horizon-skimming
orbits tend to evolve to smaller orbit inclination, toward prograde equatorial
configuration. Normal orbits, by contrast, always demonstrate slowly growing
orbit inclination (orbits evolve toward the retrograde equatorial
configuration). Using up-to-date Teukolsky-fluxes, we have concluded that the
earlier result was incorrect: all circular orbits, including nearly
horizon-skimming ones, exhibit growing orbit inclination. Using kludge fluxes
based on a Post-Newtonian expansion corrected with fits to circular and to
equatorial Teukolsky-fluxes, we argue that the inclination grows also for
eccentric nearly horizon-skimming orbits. We also find that the inclination
change is, in any case, very small. As such, we conclude that these orbits are
not likely to have a clear and peculiar imprint on the gravitational waveforms
expected to be measured by the space-based detector LISA.
","To make this work we employed two methods of calculating the behavior of orbits around the horizon. The first is a perturbation technique to study the behavior of orbits which approach the horizon. Then we investigate the effects of eccentricity and inclination on the behavior of orbits. This study provides new insights into the behavior of orbits near the horizon, and thus may be of great interest to the understanding of black hole dynamics and accretion. In this study we have analyzed the properties of orbits near the horizon. We have found that circular orbits near the horizon can be chaotic, due to the strong gravitational field around the black hole. In addition, we have found that non-circular orbits can be subjected to substantial energy dissipation, and which could have important consequences for astrophysics, such as accretion disks. We study a number of interesting phenomena, which are related to the orbits near the horizon, and the behavior of orbits around the horizon.

circulation, superfluids are irrotational, and any rotation or angular momentum
is constrained to occur through vortices with quantized circulation. Quantized
vortices also play a key role in the dissipation of transport in superfluids.
In BECs quantized vortices have been observed in several forms, including
single vortices, vortex lattices, and vortex pairs and rings. The recent
observation of quantized vortices in a fermionic gas was taken as a clear
signature of the underlying condensation and superfluidity of fermion pairs. In
addition to BECs, quantized vortices also occur in superfluid Helium, nonlinear
optics, and type-II superconductors.

We examine the dynamics of vortices, their motion and interactions, both in the presence of external potentials and in homogeneous systems.

to the phonon-induced strain, and the coaction of the

temperature, we demonstrate how to obtain the spin relaxation time from the
Fermi Golden rule in the limit of weak spin-orbit coupling. However, at high
temperature and/or for large spin-orbit coupling, one has to use the
equation-of-motion approach when many levels are involved. Moreover, spin
dephasing can be much more efficient than spin relaxation at high temperature,

transfer matrix renormalization group (TMRG) technique is applied to explore
the thermodynamic properties. The local magnetic moments, spin correlation
functions, and static structure factors are discussed in the ground state for
the three cases. It is shown that the static structure factor S(q) shows peaks
at wavevectors $q=a\pi /3$ (a=0,1,2,3,4,5) for different couplings in a zero
magnetic field, which, however in the magnetic fields where the magnetization
plateau with m=1/6 pertains, exhibits the peaks only at q=0, $2\pi /3$ and
$4\pi /3$, which are found to be couplings-independent. The DMRG results of the
zero-field static structure factor can be nicely fitted by a linear
superposition of six modes, where two fitting equations are proposed. It is
observed that the six modes are closely related to the low-lying excitations of
the system. At finite temperatures, the double-peak structures of the
susceptibility and specific heat against temperature are obtained, where the
peak positions and heights are found to depend on the competition of the

foliation on $M$, with isolated singularities of Morse type. The study and
classification of pairs $(M,\F)$ is a challenging (and difficult) problem. In
this setting, a classical result due to Reeb \cite{Reeb} states that a manifold
admitting a foliation with exactly two center-type singularities is a sphere.
In particular this is true if the foliation is given by a function. Along these
lines a result due to Eells and Kuiper \cite{Ku-Ee} classify manifolds having a
real-valued function admitting exactly three non-degenerate singular points. In
the present paper, we prove a generalization of the above mentioned results. To
do this, we first describe the possible arrangements of pairs of singularities
and the corresponding codimension one invariant sets, and then we give an
elimination procedure for suitable center-saddle and some saddle-saddle
configurations (of consecutive indices). In the second part, we investigate if
other classical results, such as Haefliger and Novikov (Compact Leaf) theorems,
proved for regular foliations, still hold true in presence of singularities. At
this purpose, in the singular set, $Sing(\F)$ of the foliation $\F$, we
consider {\em{weakly stable}} components, that we define as those components
admitting a neighborhood where all leaves are compact. If $Sing(\F)$ admits
only weakly stable components, given by smoothly embedded curves diffeomorphic
to $S^1$, we are able to extend Haefliger's theorem. Finally, the existence of
a closed curve, transverse to the foliation, leads us to state a Novikov-type
result.
","In addition, we investigate the relationship between the singularities and the topology, particularly the cohomology and homotopy groups. The results are: the classification of smooth foliated foliations up to isotopy. The classification of foliated foliations to isotopy is based on the bifurcation diagrams of the foliated foliations, and on the intersections of them. It can be used to discover and study the dynamics of foliated foliations. In our research, we are primarily interested in the properties of smooth foliated foliations with Morse. We also discuss the relation between the types and the properties of the morsel, and the cohomology and homotopy.

controversial from a statistical point of view, as the frequentist vs. bayesian
confrontation shows. We analyse several relevant questions which have not
deserved full attention and pervade the extraction of $\alpha$.
Reparametrization Invariance proves appropriate to understand those issues. We
show that some Standard Model inspired parametrizations can be senseless or
inadequate if they go beyond the minimal Gronau and London assumptions: the
single weak phase $\alpha$ just in the $\Delta I=3/2$ amplitudes, the isospin
relations and experimental data. Beside those analyses, we extract $\alpha$
through the use of several adequate parametrizations, showing that there is no
relevant discrepancy between frequentist and bayesian results. The most
relevant information, in terms of $\alpha$, is the exclusion of values around
$\alpha\sim \pi/4$; this result is valid in the presence of arbitrary New
Physics contributions to the $\Delta I=1/2$ piece.
","We study the effects of reparametrization in the extraction of alpha from the decay of B to Pi-pi-pi. This method is based on angular correlations, and we investigate the effects of reparametrization and alpha without requiring the use of strong assumptions about the dynamics of the process. We conclude that reparametrization plays a vital role in the extraction of alpha, and that neglecting it can lead to biased or incorrect determinations. Our results demonstrate that reparametrization invariance is a crucial component of the extraction of alpha, and that it is crucial that we disregard it. Our results are shown to have important implications for the interpretation of future B-factory data and for the ongoing efforts to decipher the mysteries of CP violation.

photochromic diarylethene derivatives sandwiched between two gold surfaces with
closed and open configurations are investigated by a fully self-consistent
nonequilibrium Green's function method combined with density functional theory.
The calculated transmission spectra of two configurations are strikingly
distinctive. The open form lacks any significant transmission peak within a
wide energy window, while the closed structure has two significant transmission
peaks on the both sides of the Fermi level. The electronic transport properties
of the molecular junction with closed structure under a small bias voltage are
mainly determined by the tail of the transmission peak contributed unusually by
the perturbed lowest perturbed unoccupied molecular orbital. The calculated
on-off ratio of currents between the closed and open configurations is about
two orders of magnitude, which reproduces the essential features of the
experimental measured results. Moreover, we find that the switching behavior
within a wide bias voltage window is extremely robust to both substituting F or
S for H or O and varying end anchoring atoms from S to Se and Te.
","The goal of this study is to understand the fundamental properties of photochromic materials, their potential application in the electronic industry, and to enable the development of more efficient and reliable cellular switches and memory devices. We are interested in studying the structure of the diarylethene derivatives in closed and open form, utilizing density functional theory and Green's function. Our study will provide a better understanding of the fundamental properties of the materials and their potential use in electronic devices, enabling the creation of more efficient and reliable microswitches. In the first place, we have examined the effect of the orientation of the dipole and the chemical properties of the metal, which, in turn, helps to avoid hysterics and improves the effectiveness of the device.,, and, in this regard, the synthesis of diarylethene derivatives. In this study, we investigated the synthesis of a new, synthesis of diarylethene derivatives. We show that the synthesis of this derivative is influenced by the orientation of the molecular dipole, by the chemical properties of the metal, by the synthesis of the chemical element.

mechanical properties of 20 layered (10,10) single walled carbon nanotubes
(SWCNTs) under tensile loading using an O(N) tight binding molecular dynamics
(TBMD) simulation method. We observed that (10,10) tube can sustain its
structural stability for the strain values of 0.23 in elongation and 0.06 in
compression at 300K. Bond breaking strain value decreases with increasing
temperature under streching but not under compression. The elastic limit,
Young's modulus, tensile strength and Poisson ratio are calculated as 0.10,
0.395 TPa, 83.23 GPa, 0.285, respectively, at 300K. In the temperature range
from 300K to 900K; Young's modulus and the tensile strengths are decreasing
with increasing temperature while the Poisson ratio is increasing. At higher
temperatures, Young's modulus starts to increase while the Poisson ratio and
tensile strength decrease. In the temperature range from 1200K to 1800K, the
SWCNT is already deformed and softened. Applying strain on these deformed and
softened SWCNTs do not follow the same pattern as in the temperature range of
300K to 900K.
","It was discovered that SWCNTs are very sensitive to temperature, and the tensile strength and the Young's modulus decrease with increasing temperature, and that the strain increases. We study the effects of temperature on the tensile properties of SWCNTs, and provide a key insight into the mechanical performance of SWCNTs at different temperatures. Our study reveals that the tensile properties of SWCNTs are highly sensitive to temperature. Moreover, we found that the mechanical properties of SWCNTs vary greatly with temperature. We investigate the temperature dependence of SWCNTs on temperature. The tensile properties of SWCNTs are remarkable, and are used for various devices, and are a perfect material for nanotechnology. The tensile properties of SWCNTs are highly sensitive to temperature, and the ultimate tensile strength and Young's modulus decrease with increasing temperature, and the strain decreases with increasing temperature.

the two quasars whose intergalactic HeII forest has been resolved with FUSE. By
analysing the HI and the HeII opacity variations separately, no transverse
proximity effect is detected near three foreground quasars of HE2347-4342:
QSOJ23503-4328 (z=2.282, $\vartheta=3.59$ arcmin), QSOJ23500-4319 (z=2.302,
$\vartheta=8.77$ arcmin) and QSOJ23495-4338 (z=2.690, $\vartheta=16.28$
arcmin). This is primarily due to line contamination and overdensities probably
created by large-scale structure. By comparing the HI absorption and the
corresponding HeII absorption, we estimated the fluctuating spectral shape of
the extragalactic UV radiation field along this line of sight. We find that the
UV spectral shape near HE2347-4342 and in the projected vicinity of the three
foreground quasars is statistically harder than expected from UV background
models dominated by quasars. In addition, we find three highly ionised metal
line systems near the quasars. However, they do not yield further constraints
on the shape of the ionising field. We conclude that the foreground quasars
show a transverse proximity effect that is detectable as a local hardening of
the UV radiation field, although the evidence is strongest for QSOJ23495-4338.
Thus, the relative spectral hardness traces the proximity effect also in
overdense regions prohibiting the traditional detection in the HI forest.
Furthermore, we emphasise that softening of quasar radiation by radiative
transfer in the intergalactic medium is important to understand the observed
spectral shape variations. From the transverse proximity effect of
QSOJ23495-4338 we obtain a lower limit on the quasar lifetime of ~25 Myr.
","The result was that the spectral hardness of the absorbed gas was systematically different on either side of the quasar, which indicated that the transverse proximity of the gas was altering the physical properties of the gas in question. The effect of transverse proximity was investigated with the help of the Faint Object Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope, in the presence of a bright galaxy, about 45 kpc distant, and then examined the spectral hardness of the absorbed gas at a distance of about 45 kpc. We found that the absorbed spectra of the gas was quite different from that of the other side, which indicated that the absorbed spectra were different. We conclude that this phenomenon was an important tool for the study of the gas in the intergalactic medium, and the influence of nearby galaxies on its development.

","He had been captivated by the idea that the group structure of the group could be extended to the monoids, thus opening up a new avenue of inquiry into its mathematical properties. The present study reveals the novel connection between the groups of Richard Thompson and monomorphic theory. We are interested in the development of general generalizations of the groups of Richard Thompson, with the aim of extending their group structure to the monoids, and to provide a new angle of view of their mathematical properties. In our work we have developed generalized Thompson monoids, i.e., the group structure of the group, i.e., its finite generation and its finite presentation. This research, which has been done, leads us to find the relations of these monoids with other monomorphic structures, such as the Brandt ones. We are trying to develop a new way of understanding the nature of these groups, by comparing them with other monomorphic groups. We have found that there is no such thing as a universal isomorphism, which means that we can distinguish different monomorphic groups.

[Partially Contained Events] on their zenith angle distribution, it is assumed
that the zenith angle of the incident neutrino is the same as that of the
detected charged lepton. In the present paper, we examine the validity of [the

we analyze muon-like events due to QEL. For the purpose, we develop [Time
Sequential Monte Carlo Simulation] to extract the conclusion on the validity of
the SK assumption. In our [Time Sequential Simulation], we simulate every
physical process concerned as exactly as possible without any approximation.
  From the comparison between the zenith angle distributon of the emitted muons
under [the SK assumption on the direction] and the corresponding one obtained
under our [Time Sequential Simulation], it is concluded that the measurement of
the direction of the incident neutrino for the neutrino events occurring inside
the detector in the SK analysis turns out to be unreliable, which holds
irrespective of the existence and/or non-existence of the neutrino oscillation.
","In order to test the accuracy of the fluxes, we studied the results of Monte Carlo simulations of the semi-elastic, and compared the fluxes of the proton to the true direction. Our findings show that the fluxes of the proton can be reliably guessed in a fully-elastic event at an angle of less than one degree, but that in the partially-elastic cases, where a small fraction of the energy passes through the detector, it becomes more difficult to obtain the proper direction for the sub-elastic. The study thus contributes to the study of neutrino physics and has important implications for the future of neutrino experiments. This study has been carried out in the interest of the researchers, and has provided a foundation for the study of neutrino physics. The main purpose of this study is to increase the accuracy of the neutrino oscillation measurement. To achieve this goal, we use Monte Carlo simulations to simulate the quasi-elastic event and compare the observed and the true direction of the emitted neutrino to the true direction. We examined the accuracy of the estimations from the simulations by a number of methods, such as the estimation of the emitted neutrino to the true direction and the estimation of the scattering rate from multiple scatterings.

unexpected structural feature: a knot in the polypeptide backbone. These knots
are extremely rare, but their occurrence is likely connected to protein
function in as yet unexplored fashion. Our analysis of the complete Protein
Data Bank reveals several new knots which, along with previously discovered
ones, can shed light on such connections. In particular, we identify the most
complex knot discovered to date in human ubiquitin hydrolase, and suggest that
its entangled topology protects it against unfolding and degradation by the
proteasome. Knots in proteins are typically preserved across species and
sometimes even across kingdoms. However, we also identify a knot which only
appears in some transcarbamylases while being absent in homologous proteins of
similar structure. The emergence of the knot is accompanied by a shift in the
enzymatic function of the protein. We suggest that the simple insertion of a
short DNA fragment into the gene may suffice to turn an unknotted into a
knotted structure in this protein.

We have found that many complex knots have been found in many protein families and have important biological functions, such as ion transport, signal transduction and catalysis. In short, our study sheds light on the function and evolution of complex knots in proteins and sheds light on the mechanisms for protein evolution and diversity.
