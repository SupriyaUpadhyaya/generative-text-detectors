relations of quantum mechanics systems, known as the polymer representation has
gained some attention in recent years, due to its possible relation with Planck
scale physics. In particular, this approach has been followed in a symmetric
sector of loop quantum gravity known as loop quantum cosmology. Here we explore
different aspects of the relation between the ordinary Schroedinger theory and
the polymer description. The paper has two parts. In the first one, we derive
the polymer quantum mechanics starting from the ordinary Schroedinger theory
and show that the polymer description arises as an appropriate limit. In the
second part we consider the continuum limit of this theory, namely, the reverse
process in which one starts from the discrete theory and tries to recover back
the ordinary Schroedinger quantum mechanics. We consider several examples of
interest, including the harmonic oscillator, the free particle and a simple
cosmological model.
","In this paper, we investigate the continuum limit of polymer quantum mechanics. The aim of our work is to better understand the quantum behavior of polymers and its relationship to the classical theory. Our research attempts to clarify the nature of the continuum limit and determine the correctness of the approximations made. We find that a continuous path can be defined in the polymer configuration space, which is essential for the polymer to display continuum behavior. We show that the approximation of continuous randomness in the spatial variable can certainly be used when the polymer is stretched out over a significant distance. Our methodology involves a careful combination of intuition, formalism and numerical simulations. The ideas proposed in this work are relevant to the understanding of the thermodynamic properties of polymers, as well as to quantum computing and information. The findings of this work present a theoretical framework for the investigation of other polymer properties that are still poorly understood. For a coil-like polymer, our results demonstrate that its behavior is non-classical.

the properties of the resulting high confidence set of YSO's. We find 235 such
objects in the 0.85 deg^2 field that was covered with both IRAC and MIPS. An
additional set of 51 lower confidence YSO's outside this area is identified
from the MIPS data combined with 2MASS photometry. We describe two sets of
results, color-color diagrams to compare our observed source properties with
those of theoretical models for star/disk/envelope systems and our own modeling
of the subset of our objects that appear to be star+disks. These objects
exhibit a very wide range of disk properties, from many that can be fit with
actively accreting disks to some with both passive disks and even possibly
debris disks. We find that the luminosity function of YSO's in Serpens extends
down to at least a few x .001 Lsun or lower for an assumed distance of 260 pc.
The lower limit may be set by our inability to distinguish YSO's from
extra-galactic sources more than by the lack of YSO's at very low luminosities.
A spatial clustering analysis shows that the nominally less-evolved YSO's are
more highly clustered than the later stages and that the background
extra-galactic population can be fit by the same two-point correlation function
as seen in other extra-galactic studies. We also present a table of matches
between several previous infrared and X-ray studies of the Serpens YSO

velocities consistent with an outer disc origin were detected for the first
time in an IP. The spin pulsation was modulated with velocities near ~500-600
km/s. These velocities are consistent with those of material circulating at the
outer edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretion
curtain with material near the Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Doppler
tomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extending
from velocities of ~500 km/s to ~1000 km/s. These findings have confirmed the
theoretical model predictions of King & Wynn (1999), Belle et al. (2002) and
Norton et al. (2004) for EX Hya, which predict large accretion curtains that
extend to a distance close to the Roche lobe radius in this system. Evidence
for overflow stream of material falling onto the magnetosphere was observed,
confirming the result of Belle et al. (2005) that disc overflow in EX Hya is
present during quiescence as well as outburst. It appears that the hbeta and
hgamma spin radial velocities originated from the rotation of the funnel at the
outer disc edge, while those of halpha were produced due to the flow of
material along the field lines far from the white dwarf (narrow component) and
close to the white dwarf (broad-base component), in agreement with the
accretion curtain model.

We also detect narrow emission components from the accretion column and the rapidly rotating white dwarf, which suggests the presence of a hot spot on the surface of the white dwarf. From the analysis of the emission line profiles, we found a broad range of velocities along the line of sight, indicating the presence of a highly inhomogeneous accretion flow.

equations with non-commutative vector fields whose solution evolves on a smooth

along the manifold, we pull back the stochastic flow on the manifold to the Lie

stochastic flow in the Lie algebra via closed operations and then push back to
the Lie group and then to the manifold, thus ensuring our approximation lies in
the manifold. We call such schemes stochastic Munthe-Kaas methods after their
deterministic counterparts. We also present stochastic Lie group integration
schemes based on Castell--Gaines methods. These involve using an underlying
ordinary differential integrator to approximate the flow generated by a
truncated stochastic exponential Lie series. They become stochastic Lie group
integrator schemes if we use Munthe-Kaas methods as the underlying ordinary
differential integrator. Further, we show that some Castell--Gaines methods are
uniformly more accurate than the corresponding stochastic Taylor schemes.

Here we point out the potential of chromospheric observations at millimeter
wavelengths to resolve this long-standing problem. Computations carried out
with a sophisticated dynamic model of the solar chromosphere due to Carlsson
and Stein demonstrate that millimeter emission is extremely sensitive to
dynamic processes in the chromosphere and the appropriate wavelengths to look
for dynamic signatures are in the range 0.8-5.0 mm. The model also suggests
that high resolution observations at mm wavelengths, as will be provided by
ALMA, will have the unique property of reacting to both the hot and the cool
gas, and thus will have the potential of distinguishing between rival models of
the solar atmosphere. Thus, initial results obtained from the observations of
the quiet Sun at 3.5 mm with the BIMA array (resolution of 12 arcsec) reveal
significant oscillations with amplitudes of 50-150 K and frequencies of 1.5-8
mHz with a tendency toward short-period oscillations in internetwork and longer
periods in network regions. However higher spatial resolution, such as that
provided by ALMA, is required for a clean separation between the features
within the solar atmosphere and for an adequate comparison with the output of
the comprehensive dynamic simulations.

propagation through the SN envelope within a three-neutrino framework, paying
special attention to the inclusion of NSI-induced resonant conversions, which
may take place in the most deleptonised inner layers. We study the possibility
of detecting NSI effects in a Megaton water Cherenkov detector, either through
modulation effects in the $\bar\nu_e$ spectrum due to (i) the passage of shock
waves through the SN envelope, (ii) the time dependence of the electron
fraction and (iii) the Earth matter effects; or, finally, through the possible
detectability of the neutronization $\nu_e$ burst. We find that the $\bar\nu_e$
spectrum can exhibit dramatic features due to the internal NSI-induced resonant
conversion. This occurs for non-universal NSI strengths of a few %, and for
very small flavor-changing NSI above a few$\times 10^{-5}$.

To probe NSI, we use a three-flavor neutrino propagation simulation in which we vary the NSI parameters. We simulate the expected neutrino signals from a distant supernova and compare them to the standard neutrino oscillation scenario.

show that by imposing continuity of the resulting pion scalar form factor under
tiny changes in the input \pi\pi phase shifts, a zero in the form factor for
some S-wave I=0 T-matrices is then required. Once this is accounted for, the

assumptions. In fact, we identify the quantum isometry group with the universal
object in a bigger category, namely the category of `quantum families of smooth
isometries', defined along the line of Woronowicz and Soltan. We also construct
a spectral triple on the Hilbert space of forms on a noncommutative manifold
which is equivariant with respect to a natural unitary representation of the
quantum isometry group. We give explicit description of quantum isometry groups
of commutative and noncommutative tori, and in this context, obtain the quantum
double torus defined in \cite{hajac} as the universal quantum group of
holomorphic isometries of the noncommutative torus.

Boltzmann methods (LBM). These limiters erase spurious oscillations without
blurring of shocks, and do not affect smooth solutions. In general, they do the
same work for LBM as flux limiters do for finite differences, finite volumes
and finite elements methods, but for LBM the main idea behind the construction
of nonequilibrium entropy limiter schemes is to transform a field of a scalar
quantity - nonequilibrium entropy. There are two families of limiters: (i)
based on restriction of nonequilibrium entropy (entropy ""trimming"") and (ii)
based on filtering of nonequilibrium entropy (entropy filtering). The physical
properties of LBM provide some additional benefits: the control of entropy
production and accurate estimate of introduced artificial dissipation are
possible. The constructed limiters are tested on classical numerical examples:
1D athermal shock tubes with an initial density ratio 1:2 and the 2D lid-driven
cavity for Reynolds numbers Re between 2000 and 7500 on a coarse 100*100 grid.
All limiter constructions are applicable for both entropic and non-entropic
quasiequilibria.
","We present the development of nonequilibrium entropy limiters in lattice Boltzmann methods that aim to accurately simulate fluid flows with complex physics. Our research represents a significant contribution to the field of lattice Boltzmann methods and opens up possibilities for the simulation of complex flows with high nonequilibrium thermodynamic states. These flows are characterized by nonequilibrium thermodynamic states, which lead to unphysical numerical errors without appropriate modeling. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a new concept of nonequilibrium entropy limiters based on a modified relaxation time, which helps steer the system to equilibrium and reduce the spurious numerical errors. Our simulations show significant improvements in both accuracy and stability of the simulations compared to conventional lattice Boltzmann methods. The key idea behind our approach is to introduce a nonequilibrium entropy limiter that incorporates the nonequilibrium effects into the relaxation process. The methodology is validated through a series of benchmark tests, where we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in capturing complex nonequilibrium flow physics. The motivation for this research comes from the challenges encountered in simulating flows with strong nonequilibrium effects, such as flows with high-speed micro-jets, turbulent mixing and multiphase flows.

plasmas (solar wind, interstellar medium, galaxy clusters, accretion disks).
The key assumptions are that the turbulence is anisotropic with respect to the
mean magnetic field and frequencies are low compared to the ion cyclotron
frequency. The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted
into heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETIC
CASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and
velocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each of
the physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematically
reduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the ""inertial range"" above the
ion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenic
fluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisional
and collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,
which obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated
with the Alfvenic component. In the ""dissipation range"" between the ion and
electron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave
(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive
phase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings the
energy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionless
wave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the
phase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at the
electron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scaling
relations are derived for these cascades. Astrophysical and space-physical
applications are discussed in detail.
","In this work, we investigate the kinetic and fluid turbulent dynamics in magnetized weakly collisional plasmas, focusing on astrophysical gyrokinetics. Our motivation for our research stems from the fact that weakly collisional plasmas are prevalent in astrophysical systems, such as the solar corona, the interstellar medium, and accretion disks around black holes. These plasmas exhibit complex dynamics that cannot be easily described by traditional fluid models, therefore, we employ a kinetic approach to study the turbulent cascades in these plasmas. Our main ideas involve using analytical and numerical tools to study the kinetic and fluid turbulent dynamics in weakly collisional plasmas. We show that the kinetic and fluid cascades are coupled, and their relative strengths depend on the plasma parameters. We also demonstrate the universality of the scaling exponents for the energy spectra of the turbulent fluctuations, which is consistent with observations. Our work provides fundamental insights into the turbulent dynamics of weakly collisional plasmas, which are ubiquitous in astrophysical systems and play a crucial role in driving the energy transfer in these systems.

variable topography and bottom friction generally imposes certain global
restrictions on the undular bore propagation so that the evolution of the
leading solitary wave can be substantially different from that of an isolated
solitary wave with the same initial amplitude. This non-local effect is due to
nonlinear wave interactions within the undular bore and can lead to an
additional solitary wave amplitude growth, which cannot be predicted in the

of free (scalar, spinor and vector) fields are considered from mathematical
view-point. As sources of these relations are employed the Heisenberg
equations/relations for the dynamical variables and a specific condition for
uniqueness of the operators of the dynamical variables (with respect to some
class of Lagrangians). The paracommutation relations or some their
generalizations are pointed as the most general ones that entail the validity
of all Heisenberg equations. The simultaneous fulfillment of the Heisenberg
equations and the uniqueness requirement turn to be impossible. This problem is
solved via a redefinition of the dynamical variables, similar to the normal
ordering procedure and containing it as a special case. That implies
corresponding changes in the admissible commutation relations. The introduction
of the concept of the vacuum makes narrow the class of the possible commutation
relations; in particular, the mentioned redefinition of the dynamical variables
is reduced to normal ordering. As a last restriction on that class is imposed
the requirement for existing of an effective procedure for calculating vacuum
mean values. The standard bilinear commutation relations are pointed as the
only known ones that satisfy all of the mentioned conditions and do not
contradict to the existing data.

important to the development of usable devices. It is likely that these two
types of order are strongly linked; thus, a study of spatial order will also
have strong implications for size order. Here a study of spatial order is
undertaken using a linear analysis of a commonly used model of SAQD formation
based on surface diffusion. Analytic formulas for film-height correlation
functions are found that characterize quantum dot spatial order and
corresponding correlation lengths that quantify order. Initial atomic-scale
random fluctuations result in relatively small correlation lengths (about two
dots) when the effect of a wetting potential is negligible; however, the
correlation lengths diverge when SAQDs are allowed to form at a near-critical
film height. The present work reinforces previous findings about anisotropy and
SAQD order and presents as explicit and transparent mechanism for ordering with
corresponding analytic equations. In addition, SAQD formation is by its nature
a stochastic process, and various mathematical aspects regarding statistical
analysis of SAQD formation and order are presented.

necessarily invertible) smooth self map of a compact manifold. We prove a
result that takes advantage of differences in rates of expansion in the terms
of a sheaf cohomological long exact sequence to create unique lifts of finite
dimensional invariant subspaces of one term of the sequence to invariant
subspaces of the preceding term. This allows us to take invariant cohomological
classes and under the right circumstances construct unique currents of a given
type, including unique measures of a given type, that represent those classes
and are invariant under pullback. A dynamically interesting self map may have a
plethora of invariant measures, so the uniquess of the constructed currents is
important. It means that if local growth is not too big compared to the growth
rate of the cohomological class then the expanding cohomological class gives
sufficient ""marching orders"" to the system to prohibit the formation of any
other such invariant current of the same type (say from some local dynamical
subsystem). Because we use subsheaves of the sheaf of currents we give
conditions under which a subsheaf will have the same cohomology as the sheaf
containing it. Using a smoothing argument this allows us to show that the sheaf
cohomology of the currents under consideration can be canonically identified
with the deRham cohomology groups. Our main theorem can be applied in both the
smooth and holomorphic setting.
","In this work, we address the problem of constructing dynamical objects that characterize the behavior of cohomologically expanding maps (CEMs). CEMs are a class of dynamical systems that have been extensively studied due to their rich and complex behavior. In particular, they have a high level of mixing and expansion in certain directions, which makes them a natural tool in the study of chaotic systems. The main idea of this work is to use cohomology, a powerful tool from algebraic topology, to construct these dynamical objects. These objects, called cohomological currents, have been shown to capture important information about the dynamics of the system, such as the rate of mixing and the asymptotic behavior of orbits. To construct the cohomological currents, we use a combination of tools from measure theory, topology and analysis. In particular, we use the fact that CEMs satisfy a decay of correlations property, which allows us to construct the currents in a way compatible with the system's underlying dynamics.

depends on cluster half-mass density (rho_h) in the sense that the turnover
mass M_TO increases with rho_h while the width of the GCMF decreases. We argue
that this is the expected signature of the slow erosion of a mass function that
initially rose towards low masses, predominantly through cluster evaporation
driven by internal two-body relaxation. We find excellent agreement between the
observed GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, central
concentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model in
which the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by
-dM/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1/2}. In particular, we recover the well-known
insensitivity of M_TO to r_gc. This feature does not derive from a literal
``universality'' of the GCMF turnover mass, but rather from a significant
variation of M_TO with rho_h -- the expected outcome of relaxation-driven
cluster disruption -- plus significant scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc.
Our conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are assumed to depend
instead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidal
radii, as mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1/2} or mu_ev ~ Sigma_t^{3/4} -- alternative
prescriptions that are physically motivated but involve cluster properties
(rho_t and Sigma_t) that are not as well defined or as readily observable as
rho_h. In all cases, the normalization of mu_ev required to fit the GCMF
implies cluster lifetimes that are within the range of standard values
(although falling towards the low end of this range). Our analysis does not
depend on any assumptions or information about velocity anisotropy in the
globular cluster system.
","In this work, we investigate the impact of stellar-dynamical evaporation on the mass function of globular clusters (GCs). GCs are dense clusters of old stars and serve as a crucial laboratory for understanding stellar and galactic dynamics. Despite their importance, the origin of the GC mass function remains an open question with different observational and theoretical approaches providing a wide range of possible values for the present-day mass function slope. In this work, we investigate the impact of stellar-dynamical evaporation on the mass function of globular clusters (GCs). Our main motivation for this research is to understand how GCs, which are often considered as isolated systems, are affected by the dynamical evolution of their stars. To achieve this goal, we use N-body simulations, which enable us to follow the time evolution of a massive cluster consisting of individual stars, through physical processes such as two-body relaxation and encounters. Based on these simulations, we find that GCs lose significant amounts of mass through the evaporation of stars from the outer regions, leading to a change in the steepness of the mass function. Our study provides new insights into the processes that shape the GC mass function and emphasizes the important role of dynamical evolution in shaping the star cluster structure.

two kinds, domain-wall (DW) type and phase-shift (PS) type. The DW-type implies
the ferromagnetic state with nonzero total spin and the PS-type implies the

large-scale hydrodynamic motions where the viscosity and heat conduction can be

additional term describing bulk energy losses due to inelastic collisions. We
employ Lagrangian coordinates and derive a broad family of exact non-stationary
analytical solutions that depend only on one spatial coordinate. These
solutions exhibit a new type of singularity, where the gas density blows up in
a finite time when starting from smooth initial conditions. The density blowups
signal formation of close-packed clusters of particles. As the density blow-up
time $t_c$ is approached, the maximum density exhibits a power law $\sim
(t_c-t)^{-2}$. The velocity gradient blows up as $\sim - (t_c-t)^{-1}$ while
the velocity itself remains continuous and develops a cusp (rather than a shock
discontinuity) at the singularity. The gas temperature vanishes at the
singularity, and the singularity follows the isobaric scenario: the gas
pressure remains finite and approximately uniform in space and constant in time
close to the singularity. An additional exact solution shows that the density
blowup, of the same type, may coexist with an ""ordinary"" shock, at which the
hydrodynamic fields are discontinuous but finite. We confirm stability of the
exact solutions with respect to small one-dimensional perturbations by solving
the ideal hydrodynamic equations numerically. Furthermore, numerical solutions
show that the local features of the density blowup hold universally,
independently of details of the initial and boundary conditions.

configurations, called universal sector, turns out to be same around all the
pp-waves, even off-shell, with same transverse space and same profiles for the
background scalars. In this paper we restrict our discussion to tensorial
fields only. In the context of bosonic string theory we consider on-shell
pp-waves and argue that universality requires the existence of a universal
sector of world-sheet operators whose correlation functions are insensitive to
the pp-wave nature of the metric and the background gauge flux. Such results
can also be reproduced using the world-sheet conformal field theory. We also
study such pp-waves in non-polynomial closed string field theory (CSFT). In
particular, we argue that for an off-shell pp-wave ansatz with flat transverse
space and dilaton independent of transverse coordinates the field redefinition
relating the low energy effective field theory and CSFT with all the massive
modes integrated out is at most quadratic in fields. Because of this
simplification it is expected that the off-shell pp-waves can be identified on
the two sides. Furthermore, given the massless pp-wave field configurations, an
iterative method for computing the higher massive modes using the CSFT
equations of motion has been discussed. All our bosonic string theory analyses

probability density function of measured variables. It is expressed by

by the scattering of data during calibration of experimental setup. A physical
law, which relates measured variables, is optimally extracted from experimental
data by the conditional average estimator. It is derived directly from the
kernel estimator and corresponds to a general nonparametric regression. The
proposed method is demonstrated by the modeling of a return map of noisy
chaotic data. In this example, the nonparametric regression is used to predict
a future value of chaotic time series from the present one. The mean predictor
error is used in the definition of predictor quality, while the redundancy is
expressed by the mean square distance between data points. Both statistics are
used in a new definition of predictor cost function. From the minimum of the
predictor cost function, a proper number of data in the model is estimated.

nearly extremal Kerr black hole. For very rapidly rotating black holes (spin
a=J/M>0.9524M) we have found a class of very strong field eccentric orbits
whose angular momentum L_z increases with the orbit's inclination with respect
to the equatorial plane, while keeping latus rectum and eccentricity fixed.
This behavior is in contrast with Newtonian intuition, and is in fact opposite
to the ""normal"" behavior of black hole orbits. Such behavior was noted
previously for circular orbits; since it only applies to orbits very close to
the black hole, they were named ""nearly horizon-skimming orbits"". Our analysis
generalizes this result, mapping out the full generic (inclined and eccentric)
family of nearly horizon-skimming orbits. The earlier work on circular orbits
reported that, under gravitational radiation emission, nearly horizon-skimming
orbits tend to evolve to smaller orbit inclination, toward prograde equatorial
configuration. Normal orbits, by contrast, always demonstrate slowly growing
orbit inclination (orbits evolve toward the retrograde equatorial
configuration). Using up-to-date Teukolsky-fluxes, we have concluded that the
earlier result was incorrect: all circular orbits, including nearly
horizon-skimming ones, exhibit growing orbit inclination. Using kludge fluxes
based on a Post-Newtonian expansion corrected with fits to circular and to
equatorial Teukolsky-fluxes, we argue that the inclination grows also for
eccentric nearly horizon-skimming orbits. We also find that the inclination
change is, in any case, very small. As such, we conclude that these orbits are
not likely to have a clear and peculiar imprint on the gravitational waveforms
expected to be measured by the space-based detector LISA.
","In this work, we explore the properties of nearly horizon-skimming orbits in Kerr spacetimes, both in circular and non-circular configurations. Our goal is to better understand the dynamics of such orbits near the event horizon of a rotating black hole. To achieve this, we employ a combination of analytical and numerical techniques. First, we use perturbative methods to study the behavior of circular orbits that approach the horizon; then we extend our analysis to non-circular orbits, investigating the effects of inclination and eccentricity. To complement our analytical results, we perform numerical simulations of test particles around a Kerr black hole, using a modified version of the geodesic equation. Our work sheds light on several interesting phenomena that arise in the context of horizon-skimming orbits.

flow and hence playing a key role in turbulence. The fluid rotation associated
with a vortex can be parameterized by the circulation $\Gamma=\oint {\rm d}{\bf
r}\cdot{\bf v}({\bf r})$ about the vortex, where ${\bf v}({\bf r})$ is the
fluid velocity field. While classical vortices can take any value of
circulation, superfluids are irrotational, and any rotation or angular momentum
is constrained to occur through vortices with quantized circulation. Quantized
vortices also play a key role in the dissipation of transport in superfluids.
In BECs quantized vortices have been observed in several forms, including
single vortices, vortex lattices, and vortex pairs and rings. The recent
observation of quantized vortices in a fermionic gas was taken as a clear
signature of the underlying condensation and superfluidity of fermion pairs. In
addition to BECs, quantized vortices also occur in superfluid Helium, nonlinear
optics, and type-II superconductors.

We begin by reviewing the basic physics of BECs, including their mathematical description in terms of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, and then discuss the formation of vortices in BECs and the properties of the resulting vortex structures, including their quantized core with a well-defined angular momentum. We analyze the dynamics of vortices, including their motion and interactions, both in the presence of external potentials and in homogeneous systems. Our results show that the dynamics of vortices are highly nonlinear and can lead to interesting and complex behavior, such as vortex reconnections and the formation of vortex lattices.

mechanisms, such as the hyperfine interaction with the surrounding nuclei, the
Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling together with the electron--bulk-phonon
interaction, the $g$-factor fluctuations, the direct spin-phonon coupling due
to the phonon-induced strain, and the coaction of the
electron--bulk/surface-phonon interaction together with the hyperfine

decoherence mechanisms are compared in detail. In our calculation, the
spin-orbit coupling is included in each mechanism and is shown to have marked
effect in most cases. The equation-of-motion approach is applied in studying
both the spin relaxation time $T_1$ and the spin dephasing time $T_2$, either
in Markovian or in non-Markovian limit. When many levels are involved at finite
temperature, we demonstrate how to obtain the spin relaxation time from the
Fermi Golden rule in the limit of weak spin-orbit coupling. However, at high
temperature and/or for large spin-orbit coupling, one has to use the
equation-of-motion approach when many levels are involved. Moreover, spin
dephasing can be much more efficient than spin relaxation at high temperature,

invoked to study the properties of the system in the ground state, while the
transfer matrix renormalization group (TMRG) technique is applied to explore
the thermodynamic properties. The local magnetic moments, spin correlation
functions, and static structure factors are discussed in the ground state for
the three cases. It is shown that the static structure factor S(q) shows peaks
at wavevectors $q=a\pi /3$ (a=0,1,2,3,4,5) for different couplings in a zero
magnetic field, which, however in the magnetic fields where the magnetization
plateau with m=1/6 pertains, exhibits the peaks only at q=0, $2\pi /3$ and
$4\pi /3$, which are found to be couplings-independent. The DMRG results of the
zero-field static structure factor can be nicely fitted by a linear
superposition of six modes, where two fitting equations are proposed. It is
observed that the six modes are closely related to the low-lying excitations of
the system. At finite temperatures, the double-peak structures of the

peak positions and heights are found to depend on the competition of the

foliation on $M$, with isolated singularities of Morse type. The study and
classification of pairs $(M,\F)$ is a challenging (and difficult) problem. In
this setting, a classical result due to Reeb \cite{Reeb} states that a manifold
admitting a foliation with exactly two center-type singularities is a sphere.
In particular this is true if the foliation is given by a function. Along these
lines a result due to Eells and Kuiper \cite{Ku-Ee} classify manifolds having a
real-valued function admitting exactly three non-degenerate singular points. In
the present paper, we prove a generalization of the above mentioned results. To
do this, we first describe the possible arrangements of pairs of singularities
and the corresponding codimension one invariant sets, and then we give an
elimination procedure for suitable center-saddle and some saddle-saddle
configurations (of consecutive indices). In the second part, we investigate if
other classical results, such as Haefliger and Novikov (Compact Leaf) theorems,
proved for regular foliations, still hold true in presence of singularities. At
this purpose, in the singular set, $Sing(\F)$ of the foliation $\F$, we
consider {\em{weakly stable}} components, that we define as those components
admitting a neighborhood where all leaves are compact. If $Sing(\F)$ admits
only weakly stable components, given by smoothly embedded curves diffeomorphic
to $S^1$, we are able to extend Haefliger's theorem. Finally, the existence of
a closed curve, transverse to the foliation, leads us to state a Novikov-type
result.

Our motivation for this research lies in the fact that such singularities are ubiquitous in many physical and mathematical systems, and their emergence often leads to topological and dynamical transitions.

We analyze the local and global structures of the singularities, identifying their types and their geometric properties, additionally we investigate the relationships between the singularities and the topology of the foliation, in particular its cohomology and homotopy groups.

relevant discrepancy between frequentist and bayesian results. The most
relevant information, in terms of $\alpha$, is the exclusion of values around
$\alpha\sim \pi/4$; this result is valid in the presence of arbitrary New

wide energy window, while the closed structure has two significant transmission
peaks on the both sides of the Fermi level. The electronic transport properties
of the molecular junction with closed structure under a small bias voltage are
mainly determined by the tail of the transmission peak contributed unusually by
the perturbed lowest perturbed unoccupied molecular orbital. The calculated
on-off ratio of currents between the closed and open configurations is about
two orders of magnitude, which reproduces the essential features of the

0.395 TPa, 83.23 GPa, 0.285, respectively, at 300K. In the temperature range
from 300K to 900K; Young's modulus and the tensile strengths are decreasing
with increasing temperature while the Poisson ratio is increasing. At higher
temperatures, Young's modulus starts to increase while the Poisson ratio and
tensile strength decrease. In the temperature range from 1200K to 1800K, the
SWCNT is already deformed and softened. Applying strain on these deformed and
softened SWCNTs do not follow the same pattern as in the temperature range of

the two quasars whose intergalactic HeII forest has been resolved with FUSE. By
analysing the HI and the HeII opacity variations separately, no transverse
proximity effect is detected near three foreground quasars of HE2347-4342:
QSOJ23503-4328 (z=2.282, $\vartheta=3.59$ arcmin), QSOJ23500-4319 (z=2.302,
$\vartheta=8.77$ arcmin) and QSOJ23495-4338 (z=2.690, $\vartheta=16.28$
arcmin). This is primarily due to line contamination and overdensities probably
created by large-scale structure. By comparing the HI absorption and the
corresponding HeII absorption, we estimated the fluctuating spectral shape of
the extragalactic UV radiation field along this line of sight. We find that the
UV spectral shape near HE2347-4342 and in the projected vicinity of the three
foreground quasars is statistically harder than expected from UV background
models dominated by quasars. In addition, we find three highly ionised metal
line systems near the quasars. However, they do not yield further constraints
on the shape of the ionising field. We conclude that the foreground quasars
show a transverse proximity effect that is detectable as a local hardening of
the UV radiation field, although the evidence is strongest for QSOJ23495-4338.
Thus, the relative spectral hardness traces the proximity effect also in
overdense regions prohibiting the traditional detection in the HI forest.
Furthermore, we emphasise that softening of quasar radiation by radiative
transfer in the intergalactic medium is important to understand the observed
spectral shape variations. From the transverse proximity effect of
QSOJ23495-4338 we obtain a lower limit on the quasar lifetime of ~25 Myr.
","The transverse proximity effect refers to the influence that a nearby galaxy has on the absorption properties of gas at large distances, along the same line of sight towards a background quasar. It has been previously observed, but little is known about its influence on the spectral hardness of the radiation. We present an analysis of the transverse proximity effect on the spectral hardness observed along the line of sight towards the quasar HE 2347-4342. We found that the spectral hardness of the radiation is systematically different on either side of the galaxy, indicating that the transverse proximity effect alters the physical properties of the intervening gas. More detailed studies, using a larger sample of quasars and galaxies, will be required to fully understand the physical properties involved and the systematic effects that may be present.

function in as yet unexplored fashion. Our analysis of the complete Protein
Data Bank reveals several new knots which, along with previously discovered
ones, can shed light on such connections. In particular, we identify the most
complex knot discovered to date in human ubiquitin hydrolase, and suggest that
its entangled topology protects it against unfolding and degradation by the
proteasome. Knots in proteins are typically preserved across species and
sometimes even across kingdoms. However, we also identify a knot which only
appears in some transcarbamylases while being absent in homologous proteins of
similar structure. The emergence of the knot is accompanied by a shift in the
enzymatic function of the protein. We suggest that the simple insertion of a
short DNA fragment into the gene may suffice to turn an unknotted into a
knotted structure in this protein.

The SET plays a role of the fluctuating environment affecting the qubit's

Solving these equation we obtain decoherence and relaxation rates of the qubit,
as well as the spectral density of the fluctuating qubit's parameters. We found
that in the weak coupling regime the decoherence and relaxation rates are
directly related to the spectral density taken at Rabi or at zero frequency,
depending on what a particular qubit's parameters is fluctuating. This relation
holds also in the presence of weak back-action of the qubit on the fluctuating
environment. In the case of strong back-action, such simple relationship no
longer holds, even if the qubit-SET coupling is small. It does not hold either
in the strong-coupling regime, even in the absence of the back-action. In
addition, we found that our model predicts localization of the qubit in the
strong-coupling regime, resembling that of the spin-boson model.

out that in these cases Lynch's parameter $\lambda$ is equivalent to the
expectation of average sensitivity of the Boolean functions used to construct
the network. Hence we can apply a known theorem for the expectation of the

accounting statistically for unidentified diskless members. Our Spitzer census

with the T-Tauri members, which comprise the centrally condensed cluster around
a B star. The protostars are instead found mostly at the cluster periphery
about 1 pc from the B star and spread out along a filamentary ridge. We find
that the star formation rate in this protostellar ridge is consistent with that
rate which built the exposed cluster while the presence of fifteen cold,
starless, millimeter cores intermingled with this protostellar population
indicates that the IC 348 nebula has yet to finish forming stars. We show that
the IC 348 cluster is of order 3-5 crossing times old, and, as evidenced by its
smooth radial profile and confirmed mass segregation, is likely relaxed. While
it seems apparent that the current cluster configuration is the result of
dynamical evolution and its primordial structure has been erased, our findings
support a model where embedded clusters are built up from numerous smaller
sub-clusters. Finally, the results of our Spitzer census indicate that the

receiver can be used to specify a transmit precoding matrix, which selectively
activates the strongest channel modes. Here we analyze the performance of
Random Vector Quantization (RVQ), in which the precoding matrix is selected
from a random codebook containing independent, isotropically distributed
entries. We assume that channel elements are i.i.d. and known to the receiver,
which relays the optimal (rate-maximizing) precoder codebook index to the
transmitter using B bits. We first derive the large system capacity of
beamforming (rank-one precoding matrix) as a function of B, where large system
refers to the limit as B and the number of transmit and receive antennas all go
to infinity with fixed ratios. With beamforming RVQ is asymptotically optimal,
i.e., no other quantization scheme can achieve a larger asymptotic rate. The
performance of RVQ is also compared with that of a simpler reduced-rank scalar
quantization scheme in which the beamformer is constrained to lie in a random
subspace. We subsequently consider a precoding matrix with arbitrary rank, and
approximate the asymptotic RVQ performance with optimal and linear receivers
(matched filter and Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE)). Numerical examples show
that these approximations accurately predict the performance of finite-size
systems of interest. Given a target spectral efficiency, numerical examples
show that the amount of feedback required by the linear MMSE receiver is only
slightly more than that required by the optimal receiver, whereas the matched
filter can require significantly more feedback.

approach to the P vs. NP and related problems through algebraic geometry and
representation theory. The basic principle behind this approach is called the
flip. In essence, it reduces the negative hypothesis in complexity theory (the
lower bound problems), such as the P vs. NP problem in characteristic zero, to
the positive hypothesis in complexity theory (the upper bound problems):
specifically, to showing that the problems of deciding nonvanishing of the
fundamental structural constants in representation theory and algebraic
geometry, such as the well known plethysm constants--or rather certain relaxed
forms of these decision probelms--belong to the complexity class P. In this
article, we suggest a plan for implementing the flip, i.e., for showing that
these relaxed decision problems belong to P. This is based on the reduction of
the preceding complexity-theoretic positive hypotheses to mathematical
positivity hypotheses: specifically, to showing that there exist positive
formulae--i.e. formulae with nonnegative coefficients--for the structural
constants under consideration and certain functions associated with them. These
turn out be intimately related to the similar positivity properties of the
Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and the multiplicative structural constants of the
canonical (global crystal) bases in the theory of Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum
groups. The known proofs of these positivity properties depend on the Riemann
hypothesis over finite fields and the related results. Thus the reduction here,
in conjunction with the flip, in essence, says that the validity of the P vs.
NP conjecture in characteristic zero is intimately linked to the Riemann
hypothesis over finite fields and related problems.

of a shallow but conspicuous absorption band around 0.65 microns opens some
questions about the actual mineralogy of these two asteroids. Such band has
never been observed before in basaltic asteroids with the intensity we detected

","In this white paper, we detail our proposal to use radio astrometry as a tool for detecting and characterizing extra-solar planets. Traditional methods of exoplanet detection rely on transit photometry, radial velocity and direct imaging techniques, although these methods have been successful, they are limited by various factors, such as detection bias, challenges in characterizing planetary atmospheres, and sensitivity to instrument noise.

The motivation for this research is twofold: firstly, radio astrometry has the potential to significantly enhance our understanding of exoplanetary systems, providing insights into planetary composition, atmospheric properties and evolution. Secondly, this technique can serve as a complementary approach to existing detection methods, improving our ability to discover and study exoplanets across a broad range of masses, distances and orbital characteristics.

possibility of cloaking objects from the observation by electromagnetic waves.
The basic idea of these invisibility devices \cite{glu1, glu2, le},\cite{pss1}
is to use anisotropic {\it transformation media} whose permittivity and
permeability $\var^{\lambda\nu}, \mu^{\lambda\nu}$, are obtained from the ones,
$\var_0^{\lambda\nu}, \mu^{\lambda\nu}_0$, of isotropic media, by singular
transformations of coordinates. In this paper we study electromagnetic cloaking
in the time-domain using the formalism of time-dependent scattering theory.
This formalism allows us to settle in an unambiguous way the mathematical
problems posed by the singularities of the inverse of the permittivity and the
permeability of the {\it transformation media} on the boundary of the cloaked
objects. We write Maxwell's equations in Schr\""odinger form with the
electromagnetic propagator playing the role of the Hamiltonian. We prove that
the electromagnetic propagator outside of the cloaked objects is essentially
self-adjoint. Moreover, the unique self-adjoint extension is unitarily
equivalent to the electromagnetic propagator in the medium
$\var_0^{\lambda\nu}, \mu^{\lambda\nu}_0$. Using this fact, and since the
coordinate transformation is the identity outside of a ball, we prove that the
scattering operator is the identity. Our results give a rigorous proof that the
construction of \cite{glu1, glu2, le}, \cite{pss1} perfectly cloaks passive and
active devices from observation by electromagnetic waves. Furthermore, we prove
cloaking for general anisotropic materials. In particular, our results prove
that it is possible to cloak objects inside general crystals.
","Our approach is based on a rigorous time-domain analysis of the cloaking mechanism, which involves solving the Maxwell's equations for a cloak of arbitrary shape and refractive index profile.

a 0.50 deg^2 set on a low-extinction region near the dark cloud, and a 5.3
deg^2 subset of the SWIRE ELAIS N1 data that was processed through our

young stellar object candidates in the Serpens Cloud that is not present in

extinction and cool dust emission illustrating a close correlation between the
two, and find that the most embedded YSO candidates are located in the areas of
highest visual extinction.

varied, we find small differences in the amplitude and shape dependence of the
reduced 3PCF, at a level qualitatively consistent with recent measurements from
the SDSS and 2dFGRS. We confirm that discrepancies between previous 3PCF
measurements can be explained in part by differences in binning choices. We
explore the degree to which a simple local bias model can fit the simulated

lends further credence to the straightforward association of galaxies with CDM

","In this paper, we present a novel approach for modeling the three-point correlation function (3PCF) in astronomical data. Our work attempts to address the limitations of previous methods, which primarily rely on computational simulations and traditional perturbation theory, by introducing a new hybrid model that combines perturbation theory and machine learning techniques. We show that our model outperforms existing approaches in accurately predicting the 3PCF for a range of galaxy datasets, with an average improvement of up to 20% in accuracy. Our methodology involves first using perturbation theory to compute the power spectra, bispectra and other relevant features that capture the spatial distribution of galaxies, and then we use these features as inputs to a neural network, which predicts the 3PCF. The key idea in our hybrid approach is to learn a mapping between the 3PCF and a set of perturbative features by training a neural network.

better KBO statistics and more comprehensive calculations, the data are broadly
consistent with KBO formation in a massive disk followed by substantial
collisional grinding and dynamical ejection. However, there are important
problems reconciling the results of coagulation and dynamical calculations.
Contrasting our current understanding of the evolution of KBOs and asteroids
suggests that additional observational constraints, such as the identification
of more dynamical families of KBOs (like the 2003 EL61 family), would provide
additional information on the relative roles of collisional grinding and
dynamical ejection in the Kuiper Belt. The uncertainties also motivate
calculations that combine collisional and dynamical evolution, a `unified'
calculation that should give us a better picture of KBO formation and
evolution.

lensing, and optical observations with numerical simulations of the merging
galaxy cluster 1E0657-56. X-ray observations reveal a bullet-like subcluster
with a prominent bow shock, while lensing results show that the positions of
the total mass peaks are consistent with the centroids of the collisionless
galaxies (and inconsistent with the X-ray brightness peaks). Previous studies,
based on older observational datasets, have placed upper limits on the
self-interaction cross-section of dark matter per unit mass, sigma/m, using
simplified analytic techniques. In this work, we take advantage of new,
higher-quality observational datasets by running N-body simulations of
1E0657-56 that include the effects of self-interacting dark matter, and
comparing the results with observations. Furthermore, the recent data allow for
a new independent method of constraining sigma/m, based on the non-observation
of an offset between the bullet subcluster mass peak and galaxy centroid. This
new method places an upper limit (68% confidence) of sigma/m < 1.25 cm^2/g. If
we make the assumption that the subcluster and the main cluster had equal
mass-to-light ratios prior to the merger, we derive our most stringent
constraint of sigma/m < 0.7 cm^2/g, which comes from the consistency of the
subcluster's observed mass-to-light ratio with the main cluster's, and with the
universal cluster value, ruling out the possibility of a large fraction of dark
matter particles being scattered away due to collisions. Our limit is a slight
improvement over the previous result from analytic estimates, and rules out
most of the 0.5 - 5cm^2/g range invoked to explain inconsistencies between the
standard collisionless cold dark matter model and observations.

2155-304 was observed from May to December 2005. The wavelength interval
explored, the total number of photometric points and the short integration time
render our photometry substantially superior to previous ones for this source.

of the source, each of duration of months, which include all those described in
the literature. In particular, we report the highest state ever detected in the
H band. The source varied by a factor of 4 in this band, much more than in the
V band (a factor ~2). The source softened with increasing intensity, contrary
to the general pattern observed in the UV-X-ray bands. On five nights of
November we had nearly continuous monitoring for 2-3 hours. A variability

for all stars of spectral type K7V or earlier, demonstrating that the donor
star, unless later than K7V, cannot be the sole NIR flux source in A0620-00. In
addition, the atomic absorption lines in the K3V spectrum are too weak with
respect to those of A0620-00 even at 100% donor star contribution, restricting
the spectral type of the donor star in A0620-00 to later than K3V. Comparison
of the A0620-00 spectrum to scaled K star spectra indicates that the CO

high energy (VHE) gamma-ray regime. Here, we use a time-dependent leptonic jet
model to reproduce the SED and optical spectral variability observed during our

the observed SED and optical light curves and predict an intrinsic cutoff value
for the VHE gamma-ray emission at ~ 4 GeV. The effect of the optical depth due
to the intergalactic infrared background radiation (IIBR) on the peak of the

of a broad line region (BLR) in the case of 3C 66A may play an important role
in the emission of gamma-ray photons when the emission region is very close to
the central engine, but further out, the production mechanism of hard X-ray and

planetary formation mechanisms. Aims: This motivates planet searches around
stars which are significantly more massive or less massive than the Sun, and in

Methods: As part of that program, we obtained measurements of GJ 674, an M2.5
dwarf at d=4.5 pc, which have a dispersion much in excess of their internal
errors. An intensive observing campaign demonstrates that the excess dispersion
is due to two superimposed coherent signals, with periods of 4.69 and 35 days.
Results: These data are well described by a 2-planet Keplerian model where each
planet has a ~11 Mearth minimum mass. A careful analysis of the (low level)
magnetic activity of GJ 674 however demonstrates that the 35-day period
coincides with the stellar rotation period. This signal therefore originates in
a spot inhomogeneity modulated by stellar rotation. The 4.69-day signal on the
other hand is caused by a bona-fide planet, GJ 674b. Conclusion: Its detection
adds to the growing number of Neptune-mass planets around M-dwarfs, and
reinforces the emerging conclusion that this mass domain is much more populated
than the jovian mass range. We discuss the metallicity distributions of M dwarf

the cosmic microwave background, indicating the presence of widespread warm
molecular gas at intermediate densities. Overall, the distributions of H$_2$CO
and CO (taken from the literature) are fairly similar, though significant
differences exist at small scales. Most notably, while the CO peak is nearly
coincident with the S140 H${\alpha}$ arc, the maximum H$_2$CO absorption is
clearly separated from it by a full 10$'$ beam ($\sim$ 3 pc). We argue that
these differences result from differing abundances and excitation requirements.
The CO(1-0) line is more optically thick and more biased towards warm gas than
the H$_2$CO 6 cm line. On the other hand, formaldehyde is more easily
photodissociated and is, therefore, a poorer tracer of the molecular gas

envelope of a donor star engulfs a much denser companion, and the core of the
donor plus the dense companion star spiral inward through this dissipative
envelope. As conceived by Paczynski and Ostriker, this process must be
responsible for the creation of short-period binaries with degenerate
components, and, indeed, it has proven capable of accounting for short-period
binaries containing one white dwarf component. However, attempts to reconstruct
the evolutionary histories of close double white dwarfs have proven more
problematic, and point to the need for enhanced systemic mass loss, either
during the close of the first, slow episode of mass transfer that produced the
first white dwarf, or during the detached phase preceding the final, common
envelope episode. The survival of long-period interacting binaries with massive
white dwarfs, such as the recurrent novae T CrB and RS Oph, also presents
interpretative difficulties for simple energetic treatments of common envelope
evolution. Their existence implies that major terms are missing from usual
formulations of the energy budget for common envelope evolution. The most
plausible missing energy term is the energy released by recombination in the
common envelope, and, indeed, a simple reformulation the energy budget
explicitly including recombination resolves this issue.
","In this study, we revisit the concept of common envelope evolution (CEE) of binary systems consisting of a giant star and a companion. We aim to delve deeper into the physics of CEE, which remains one of the most poorly understood aspects of stellar evolution, despite its crucial role in the formation and evolution of a wide range of objects, such as cataclysmic variables, X-ray binaries, and double compact objects.

quasi-ballistic transport and long coherence lengths; properties which may

include a full mass spectrum of stars, stellar evolution, binary evolution and
the tidal field of the Galaxy. We find that the overall binary fraction of a
cluster almost always remains close to the primordial value, except at late
times when a cluster is near dissolution. A critical exception occurs in the
central regions where we observe a marked increase in binary fraction with time
-- a simulation starting with 100000 stars and 5% binaries reached a core
binary frequency as high as 40% at the end of the core-collapse phase
(occurring at 16 Gyr with ~20000 stars remaining). Binaries are destroyed in
the core by a variety of processes as a cluster evolves, but the combination of
mass-segregation and creation of new binaries in exchange interactions produces
the observed increase in relative number. We also find that binaries are cycled
into and out of cluster cores in a manner that is analogous to convection in
stars. For models of 100000 stars we show that the evolution of the core-radius
up to the end of the initial phase of core-collapse is not affected by the

less). We discuss the ramifications of our results for the likely primordial

particles as seeds in an iterative search for stable cones. A longstanding
infrared (IR) unsafety issue in such algorithms is often assumed to be solvable
by adding extra `midpoint' seeds, but actually is just postponed to one order
higher in the coupling. A proper solution is to switch to an exact seedless
cone algorithm, one that provably identifies all stable cones. The only
existing approach takes N 2^N time to find jets among N particles, making it
unusable at hadron level. This can be reduced to N^2 ln(N) time, leading to
code (SISCone) whose speed is similar to that of public midpoint
implementations. Monte Carlo tests provide a strong cross-check of an
analytical proof of the IR safety of the new algorithm, and the absence of any
'R_{sep}' issue implies a good practical correspondence between parton and
hadron levels. Relative to a midpoint cone, the use of an IR safe seedless
algorithm leads to modest changes for inclusive jet spectra, mostly through
reduced sensitivity to the underlying event, and significant changes for some
multi-jet observables.
","In this work, we present a practical Seedless Infrared-Safe Cone (SISCone) jet algorithm in high-energy particle physics. Using a combination of infrared safety and seedlessness, this jet algorithm overcomes the problems faced by the traditional cone algorithm and removes the need for a seed. The efficacy of the SISCone algorithm is evaluated using simulated data from LHC experiments, comparing its performance to other jet algorithms, including the anti-kT and Cambridge/Aachen algorithms. The results obtained show that the SISCone algorithm is highly efficient and produces results that are comparable or superior to those of other jet algorithms. Our key idea is to eliminate the need for a seed by using a recursive clustering procedure. The robustness of the SISCone algorithm, along with its efficient and accurate performance, makes it an excellent choice for jets in high-energy particle physics experiments.

elaborate prescription in which artificial viscosity is essentially absent,
unless a shock is detected, and a much larger number of SPH particles than

region of the merger remnant can, once it has reached quasi-static equilibrium,
be approximated as a differentially rotating CO star, which consists of a
slowly rotating cold core and a rapidly rotating hot envelope surrounded by a
centrifugally supported disc. We construct a model of the CO remnant that
mimics the results of the SPH simulation using a one-dimensional hydrodynamic
stellar evolution code and then follow its secular evolution. The stellar
evolution models indicate that the growth of the cold core is controlled by
neutrino cooling at the interface between the core and the hot envelope, and
that carbon ignition in the envelope can be avoided despite high effective
accretion rates. This result suggests that the assumption of forced accretion
of cold matter that was adopted in previous studies of the evolution of double
CO white dwarf merger remnants may not be appropriate. Our results imply that
at least some products of double CO white dwarfs merger may be considered good

pursuit regression, has proven to be an efficient way of coping with the high
dimensional problem in nonparametric regression. In this paper, based on weakly
dependent sample, we investigate the single-index prediction (SIP) model which
is robust against deviation from the single-index model. The single-index is
identified by the best approximation to the multivariate prediction function of
the response variable, regardless of whether the prediction function is a
genuine single-index function. A polynomial spline estimator is proposed for
the single-index prediction coefficients, and is shown to be root-n consistent
and asymptotically normal. An iterative optimization routine is used which is
sufficiently fast for the user to analyze large data of high dimension within
seconds. Simulation experiments have provided strong evidence that corroborates
with the asymptotic theory. Application of the proposed procedure to the rive
flow data of Iceland has yielded superior out-of-sample rolling forecasts.

We present the results of an empirical study on predicting the success of university students based on their socio-demographic and academic profiles. The data were collected from a large, public university in the United States over a four-year period. Our study demonstrates the potential of SSIPM in analyzing complex data sets with non-linear relationships between predictors and outcomes. The model comprises a combination of cubic spline functions and a single index regression model that emphasizes nonlinearity in the predictors.

rays by collecting fluorescence light emitted from nitrogen molecules along the
extensive air shower cascade. To ensure a reliable energy determination, the
light signal needs to be corrected for atmospheric effects, which not only
attenuate the signal, but also produce a non-negligible background component
due to scattered Cherenkov light and multiple-scattered light. The correction
requires regular measurements of the aerosol attenuation length and the aerosol
phase function, defined as the probability of light scattered in a given
direction. At the Pierre Auger Observatory in Malargue, Argentina, the phase
function is measured on an hourly basis using two Aerosol Phase Function (APF)
light sources. These sources direct a UV light beam across the field of view of
the fluorescence detectors; the phase function can be extracted from the image
of the shots in the fluorescence detector cameras. This paper describes the
design, current status, standard operation procedure, and performance of the
APF system at the Pierre Auger Observatory.
","Our methodology involved collecting fluorescence data from atmospheric nitrogen molecules excited by cosmic ray showers. We analyzed the spectral dependency of the fluorescence light intensity for different zenith angles, and using that information we extracted the aerosol phase function. Our measurement of the aerosol phase function was found to be consistent with the modified Gamma distribution model within the confidence intervals, and we computed the aerosol optical depth as well. Our findings offer valuable insights into the aerosol scattering properties for the fluorescence technique used in the Pierre Auger Observatory, which will help in understanding and reducing the systematic uncertainties in the energy estimation of ultra-high energy cosmic ray events detected by the observatory. Our research thus makes a significant contribution towards improving the accuracy and reliability of cosmic ray measurements, ultimately advancing our understanding of the universe.

their protoplanetary disks, but the extent to which material can flow from the
circumbinary disk across the gap onto the individual circumstellar disks has
been unclear. In binaries with eccentric orbits, periodic perturbation of the
outer disk is predicted to induce mass flow across the gap, resulting in
accretion that varies with the binary period. This accretion may manifest
itself observationally as periodic changes in luminosity. Here we present a
search for such periodic accretion in the pre-main-sequence spectroscopic
binary UZ Tau E. We present BVRI photometry spanning three years; we find that
the brightness of UZ Tau E is clearly periodic, with a best-fit period of 19.16
+/- 0.04 days. This is consistent with the spectroscopic binary period of 19.13
days, refined here from analysis of new and existing radial velocity data. The
brightness of UZ Tau E shows significant random variability, but the overall
periodic pattern is a broad peak in enhanced brightness, spanning more than
half the binary orbital period. The variability of the H-alpha line is not as
clearly periodic, but given the sparseness of the data, some periodic component
is not ruled out. The photometric variations are in good agreement with
predictions from simulations of binaries with orbital parameters similar to
those of UZ Tau E, suggesting that periodic accretion does occur from
circumbinary disks, replenishing the inner disks and possibly extending the
timescale over which they might form planets.
","In this study, we investigate the periodic variability in the infrared excess of the young binary system UZ Tau E and propose a possible mechanism that could account for this variability. Circumbinary disks are known to exist around some binary systems, and we explore the possibility that accretion from such a disk could produce the observed periodic signal. We fit the parameters of these components to the observed data using Bayesian inference, and find that an accretion component that varies periodically with a period of approximately 39 days provides a good fit to the data.

network growth rule which comprises addition and deletion of nodes, and propose
an evolving network model to investigate the effect of node deleting on network

structure is significantly transformed. In particular, degree distribution of
the network undergoes a transition from scale-free to exponential forms as the
intensity of node deleting increases. At the same time, nontrivial
disassortative degree correlation develops spontaneously as a natural result of
network evolution in the model. We also demonstrate that node deleting
introduced in the model does not destroy the connectedness of a growing network
so long as the increasing rate of edges is not excessively small. In addition,
it is found that node deleting will weaken but not eliminate the small-world
effect of a growing network, and generally it will decrease the clustering
coefficient in a network.

both elliptical galaxies and the bulges of disc galaxies makes it
straightforward to estimate accurate black hole masses in early- and late-type

with a Schechter function and find, at the low-mass end, a logarithmic slope
(1+alpha) of ~0.7 for the full galaxy sample and ~1.0 for the early-type galaxy
sample. Considering spheroidal stellar systems brighter than M_B = -18 mag, and
integrating down to black hole masses of 10^6 M_sun, we find that the local
mass density of supermassive black holes in early-type galaxies rho_{bh,
early-type} = (3.5+/-1.2) x 10^5 h^3_{70} M_sun Mpc^{-3}, and in late-type
galaxies rho_{bh, late-type} = (1.0+/-0.5) x 10^5 h^3_{70} M_sun Mpc^{-3}. The
uncertainties are derived from Monte Carlo simulations which include
uncertainties in the M_bh-n relation, the catalogue of Sersic indices, the

independence, is examined first. Then generalized entropies are introduced, all
of which give generalizations to Shannon entropy. It is shown that the nature
of the recursivity postulate automatically determines the logarithmic
functional form for Shannon entropy. Due to the logarithmic nature, Shannon
entropy naturally gives rise to additivity, when applied to situations having
product probability property. It is argued that the natural process is
non-additivity, important, for example, in statistical mechanics, even in
product probability property situations and additivity can hold due to the
involvement of a recursivity postulate leading to a logarithmic function.
Generalizations, including Mathai's generalized entropy are introduced and some
of the properties are examined. Situations are examined where Mathai's entropy
leads to pathway models, exponential and power law behavior and related
differential equations. Connection of Mathai's entropy to Kerridge's measure of
""inaccuracy"" is also explored.
","We aim to formulate an extended framework for the analysis of non-equilibrium systems that enables us to elucidate not only the macroscopic quantities but also the micro-level dynamics of the system. This paper lays the foundation for future work aiming to develop more efficient approaches to analyze and predict the behavior of complex systems. To achieve this goal, we start by introducing the concept of a generalized entropy measure that considers the distinct ways in which the system evolves over time. We then utilize a graph-theoretic formalism to represent the system's pathways, which allows us to examine how the evolution of the system gives rise to different possible states. Through our analysis, we investigate the effects of perturbations on the entropy measures and pathways of the system. Our research provides new insights into the dynamics of complex systems and their response to perturbations.

of neutral fractional diffusion, space-fractional diffusion, and

RDEs play a critical role in this area because they can describe many phenomena, from chemical reactions and polymerization to population growth and heat transfer. However, finding exact solutions of RDEs is a challenging issue. Motivated by this problem, we present a novel approach to solving fractional RDEs in terms of the H-function.

equations of orbital dynamics was analysed in an earlier paper by the authors.
The results showed good agreement with the observed flat rotation curves of
galaxies and the Pioneer Anomaly. This analysis did not require the
modification of Newtonian dynamics, but rather only their restatement in a five
dimensional framework. The same analysis derived a acceleration parameter ar,
which plays an important role in the restated equations of orbital dynamics,
and suggested a value for ar. In this companion paper, the principle of
conservation of energy is restated within the same five-dimensional framework.
The resulting analysis provides an alternative route to estimating the value of
ar, without reference to the equations of orbital dynamics, and based solely on
key cosmological constants and parameters, including the gravitational
constant, G. The same analysis suggests that: (i) the inverse square law of
gravity may itself be due to the conservation of energy at the boundary between
a four-dimensional universe and a fifth large-scale space-time dimension; and
(ii) there is a limiting case for the Tulley-Fisher relationship linking the
speed of light to the mass of the Universe.

with a simple modelling of the stiffness measurements. Local nano-friction
experiments were conducted with the same device in order to determine the
evolution of the friction coefficient as a function of the applied pressure for
the different lubricant formulations. For the MoDTC film, the applied pressure
in the friction test remains low (<0.5 GPa) and the apparent friction
coefficient is high ($\mu$ > 0.4). For the tribofilms containing MoDTC together
with ZDTP, which permits the applied pressure to increase up to a few GPa
through some accommodation process, a very low friction domain appears (0.01 <
$\mu$ < 0.05), located a few nanometers below the surface of the tribofilm.
This low friction coefficient is attributed to the presence of MoS2 planes
sliding over each other in a favourable configuration obtained when the
pressure is sufficiently high, which is made possible by the presence of ZDTP.

i.e., is non-asymptotic (here denoted as \textit{LB inverse kinetic theory}).
The purpose of this paper is theoretical and aims at developing an inverse

requirements. In particular, the discrete kinetic theory can be defined so that
it yields exactly the fluid equation also for arbitrary non-equilibrium (but
suitably smooth) kinetic distribution functions and arbitrarily close to the
boundary of the fluid domain. Unlike previous entropic LB methods the theorem
can be obtained without functional constraints on the class of the initial
distribution functions. Possible realizations of the theory and asymptotic
approximations are provided which permit to determine the fluid equations

of customary LB approaches and comparisons with the Chorin artificial

as compared to the literature's data and allows us to investigate the
properties of objects with estimated diameter smaller than 40--50 km. The
analysis of the spectral slopes and colors versus the estimated diameters shows
that the blue and red objects have indistinguishable size distribution. We

sample was selected to investigate whether objects of this kind could be relics
of radio-loud AGNs switched off at very early stages of their evolution or
possibly to indicate intermittent activity. Initial observations were made
using MERLIN at 5 GHz. The sources have now been observed with the VLBA at 1.7,
5 and 8.4 GHz in a snapshot mode with phase-referencing. The resulting maps are
presented along with unpublished 8.4-GHz VLA images of five sources. Some of
the sources discussed here show a complex radio morphology and therefore a
complicated past that, in some cases, might indicate intermittent activity. One
of the sources studied - 1045+352 - is known as a powerful radio and
infrared-luminous broad absorption line (BAL) quasar. It is a young CSS object
whose asymmetric two-sided morphology on a scale of several hundred parsecs,
extending in two different directions, may suggest intermittent activity. The
young age and compact structure of 1045+352 is consistent with the evolution
scenario of BAL quasars. It has also been confirmed that the submillimetre flux
of 1045+352 can be seriously contaminated by synchrotron emission.
","In this paper, we present the milliarcsecond-scale morphology of compact steep spectrum (CSS) sources based on the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-centimeters survey. The main goal of this study is to provide insight into the physical processes, such as jet propagation and interaction with the surrounding medium, that govern the evolution of CSS sources. To achieve this, we used a sample of 157 CSS sources identified from the FIRST survey and imaged them using Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) at 1.6 GHz. Our analysis reveals that the CSS sources display a diverse range of morphologies, including core jet, double and triple configurations. We also find that the sources with larger linear sizes exhibit more complex morphologies, which may indicate more powerful jets. This study highlights the importance of high-resolution imaging and the utility of the FIRST survey for studying the milliarcsecond-scale morphology of radio sources. The results also provide valuable insights into the physical properties of CSS sources, and their evolution, which may have important implications for our understanding of the formation and growth of massive galaxies. Moreover, the radio emission in most of the objects is found to be confined within a few kiloparsecs from the center, which is consistent with the notion that CSS sources are early stages in the evolution",0.4666666666666667,0.6666666666666666,0.4508670520231214,0.8148148148148148,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0.03409677679413866,0.23055686208539858,0.07142857142857142,0.1836734693877551,1,0,0,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

undertaken to date, trigonometric parallaxes are crucial missing data. Distance
measurements are mandatory to kinematically segregate halo object from disk
objects and hence enable a more reliable estimate of the local density of halo
dark matter residing in such objects.
  We present trigonometric parallax measurements for 15 candidate halo white
dwarfs (WDs) selected from the Oppenheimer et al. (2001) list. We observed the
stars using the ESO 1.56-m Danish Telescope and ESO 2.2-m telescope from August
2001 to July 2004. Parallaxes with accuracies of 1--2 mas were determined
yielding relative errors on distances of $\sim5$% for 6 objects, $\sim12$% for
3 objects, and $\sim20$% for two more objects. Four stars appear to be too
distant (probably farther than 100 pc) to have measurable parallaxes in our
observations. Distances, absolute magnitudes and revised space velocities were
derived for the 15 halo WDs from the Oppenheimer et al. (2001) list. Halo
membership is confirmed unambiguously for 6 objects while 5 objects may be
thick disk members and 4 objects are too distant to draw any conclusion based
solely on kinematics. Comparing our trigonometric parallaxes with photometric
parallaxes used in previous work reveals an overestimation of distance as
derived from photometric techniques. This new data set can be used to revise
the halo white dwarf space density, and that analysis will be presented in a
subsequent publication.

collapse supernovae. In this paper we present high-resolution simulations,

show that the excitation of Kelvin-Helmholtz-like fluid modes outside the
corotation radius of the star leads to the saturation of the bar-mode
deformation. While the overall trends reported in an earlier investigation are
confirmed by our work, we also find that numerical resolution plays an

networks of interaction, such as model social networks, have been shown to have
a fundamental effect on the dynamics and outcome of evolutionary games. These
effects have, however, proved to be sensitive to the details of the underlying
topology and dynamics. Here we introduce a minimal population structure that is
described by two distinct hierarchical levels of interaction. We believe this
model is able to identify effects of spatial structure that do not depend on
the details of the topology. We derive the dynamics governing the evolution of
a system starting from fundamental individual level stochastic processes
through two successive meanfield approximations. In our model of population
structure the topology of interactions is described by only two parameters: the
effective population size at the local scale and the relative strength of local
dynamics to global mixing. We demonstrate, for example, the existence of a
continuous transition leading to the dominance of cooperation in populations
with hierarchical levels of unstructured mixing as the benefit to cost ratio
becomes smaller then the local population size. Applying our model of spatial
structure to the repeated prisoner's dilemma we uncover a novel and
counterintuitive mechanism by which the constant influx of defectors sustains
cooperation. Further exploring the phase space of the repeated prisoner's
dilemma and also of the ""rock-paper-scissor"" game we find indications of rich
structure and are able to reproduce several effects observed in other models
with explicit spatial embedding, such as the maintenance of biodiversity and
the emergence of global oscillations.

Dispersion relations for torsional oscillations are derived analytically in

inhomogeneity strength. It is shown that the inhomogeneous mass density field
leads to the reduction of a wave frequency of torsional oscillations, in
comparison to that of estimated from mass density at the loop apex. This
frequency reduction results from the decrease of an average Alfven speed as far
as the inhomogeneous loop is denser at its footpoints. The derived dispersion

torsional oscillations which result in periodic variations of spectral line
widths. Torsional oscillations offer an additional powerful tool for a

present and study a family of rate-1/2 partially systematic PCCCs, which we
call pseudo-randomly punctured codes. We evaluate their bit error rate
performance and we show that they always yield a lower error floor than that of
their rate-1/3 parent codes. Furthermore, we compare analytic results to

error floor region, owning to the moderate puncturing of their systematic
output. Consequently, we propose pseudo-random puncturing as a means of
improving the bandwidth efficiency of a PCCC and simultaneously lowering its
error floor.

However, they suffer from a well-known issue known as the error floor, which corresponds to a region in which the bit error rate performance is significantly worse than what can be predicted by standard analytical techniques. Our work addresses this limitation by proposing a new puncturing scheme that introduces a controlled amount of randomness into the puncturing pattern. By doing so, we are able to break the correlation between the errors at the output of the constituent encoders, which is the main driver of the error floor. In this way, we are able to significantly reduce the error floor and extend the useful range of turbo codes.

some almost-sure limit results for the long-term behavior of this particle
system, namely the speed at which the population of particles colonizes both
space and type dimensions, as well as the rate at which the population grows
within this asymptotic shape. Our approach will include identification of an
explicit two-phase mechanism by which particles can build up in sufficient
numbers with spatial positions near $-\gamma t$ and type positions near $\kappa
\sqrt{t}$ at large times $t$. The proofs involve the application of a variety
of martingale techniques--most importantly a ``spine'' construction involving a
change of measure with an additive martingale. In addition to the model's
intrinsic interest, the methodologies presented contain ideas that will adapt
to other branching settings. We also briefly discuss applications to traveling
wave solutions of an associated reaction--diffusion equation.
","We begin by introducing the concept of typed branching diffusion, which models the evolution of a population where individuals are categorized into different types. We then focus on the exponential growth rate, defined as the rate at which the total population size increases without bound as time goes to infinity. This growth rate is essential for understanding the long-term behavior of the population and can have important implications for many real-world applications. Our work contributes to the understanding of the long-term behavior of populations in which individuals exhibit different characteristics. Our methodology involves obtaining upper and lower bounds on the exponential growth rate and studying the conditions under which these bounds are tight. Our methodology involves obtaining upper and lower bounds on the exponential growth rate and studying the conditions under which these bounds are tight. We present results that show that the exponential growth rate can be much larger than the constant growth rate observed in the absence of branching. We also show that the tightness of our upper and lower bounds is related to the degree of heterogeneity in the branching types.

$\mathcal{O}(\eVq)$ mass-squared difference, $\Dmq_\Sbl$. We perform our
analysis using the OPERA detector as a reference (our analysis can be upgraded
including a detailed simulation of the ICARUS detector). We point out that the
channel with the largest potential to constrain the sterile neutrino parameter
space at the CNGS beam is $\nu_\mu \to \nu_\tau$. The reason for that is
twofold: first, the active-sterile mixing angle that governs this oscillation
is the less constrained by present experiments; second, this is the signal for
which both OPERA and ICARUS have been designed, and thus benefits from an
extremely low background. In our analysis we also took into account $\nu_\mu
\to \nu_e$ oscillations. We find that the CNGS potential to look for sterile
neutrinos is limited with nominal intensity of the beam, but it is
significantly enhanced with a factor 2 to 10 increase in the neutrino flux.
Data from both channels allow us, in this case, to constrain further the
four-neutrino model parameter space. Our results hold for any value of
$\Dmq_\Sbl \gtrsim 0.1 \eVq$, \textit{i.e.} when oscillations driven by this

This system admits three constants of the motion in absence of radiation
reaction: energy, angular momentum, and a third constant analogous to the
Carter constant. We compute instantaneous and time-averaged rates of change of
these three constants. For a point particle orbiting a black hole, Ryan has
computed the leading order evolution of the orbit's Carter constant, which is
linear in the spin. Our result, when combined with an interaction quadratic in
the spin (the coupling of the black hole's spin to its own radiation reaction
field), gives the next to leading order evolution. The effect of the
quadrupole, like that of the linear spin term, is to circularize eccentric
orbits and to drive the orbital plane towards antialignment with the symmetry
axis. In addition we consider a system of two point masses where one body has a
single mass multipole or current multipole. To linear order in the mass ratio,
to linear order in the multipole, and to the leading post-Newtonian order, we
show that there does not exist an analog of the Carter constant for such a

functional properties of brain networks. Structural properties of networks
recently described allow their characterization as small-world, random

rewired, small-world, scale-free and random networks, using two analysis
strategies, in which we measure the effects of the removal of nodes and
connections on the structural properties of the cortical networks. The brain
networks' structural decay is in most respects similar to that of scale-free

connections as structural basis for some of the conditional robustness of brain
systems. This informs the understanding of the development of brain networks'

solutions of a perturbed Skorokhod problem. We use the invariance principle to
show weak existence of SRBMs under mild conditions. We also use the invariance
principle, in conjunction with known uniqueness results for SRBMs, to give some
sufficient conditions for validating approximations involving (i) SRBMs in
convex polyhedrons with a constant reflection vector field on each face of the

that the source is an embedded protostar viewed at an extremely high

product spacetimes with a one-dimensional Lorentzian (timelike) factor, whereas
warped spacetimes with a two-dimensional Lorentzian factor are restricted to
the types D or O. By exploring the Bianchi identities, we then analyze the
simplest non-trivial case from the above classes - type D vacuum spacetimes,
possibly with a cosmological constant, dropping, however, the assumptions that
the spacetime is static, stationary or warped. It is shown that for ``generic''
type D vacuum spacetimes the corresponding principal null directions are
geodetic in any dimension (this applies also to type II spacetimes). For n>=5,
however, there may exist particular cases of type D spacetimes which admit
non-geodetic multiple principal null directions and we present such examples in
any n>=7. Further studies are restricted to five dimensions, where the type D
Weyl tensor is described by a 3x3 matrix \Phi_{ij}. In the case with
``twistfree'' (A_{ij}=0) principal null geodesics we show that in a ``generic''

70573. The star is a G type dwarf located at a distance of 46 pc with age
estimation between 20 and 300 Myrs. We carried out spectroscopic observations
of this star with FEROS at the 2.2 m MPG/ESO telescope at La Silla. Our
spectroscopic analysis yields a spectral type of G1-1.5V and an age of about
100 Myrs. Variations in stellar radial velocity of HD 70573 have been monitored
since December 2003 until January 2007. The velocity accuracy of FEROS within
this period is about 10 m/s. HD 70573 shows a radial velocity variation with a
period of 852 +/- 12 days and a semi-amplitude of 149 +/- 6 m/s. The period of
this variation is significantly longer than its rotational period, which is 3.3
days. Based on the analysis of the Ca II K emission line, Halpha and Teff
variation as stellar activity indicators as well as the lack of a correlation
between the bisector velocity span and the radial velocity, we can exclude the
rotational modulation and non-radial pulsations as the source of the
long-period radial velocity variation. Thus, the presence of a low-mass
companion around the star provides the best explanation for the observed radial
velocity variation. Assuming a primary mass m1=1.0 +/- 0.1 Msun for the host
star, we calculated a minimum mass of the companion m2sini of 6.1 Mjup, which
lies in the planetary mass regime, and an orbital semi-major axis of 1.76 AU.
The orbit of the planet has an eccentricity of e=0.4. The planet discovery
around the young star HD 70573 gives an important input for the study of debris
disks around young stars and their relation to the presence of planets.
","In this study, we investigate evidence for a new planetary companion around the young star AU Mic. Using high-precision radial velocity measurements with the HARPS spectrograph and radial velocity subtraction techniques, we have detected a signal that is consistent with a planetary companion with a minimum mass of 0.27 Jupiter masses and an orbital period of 8.47 days. The problem that we attempt to solve is the detection of more planetary systems around nearby stars, which will help us understand the formation and evolution of planetary systems. Our results provide evidence for the existence of a planetary companion around AU Mic and add to the growing body of knowledge about exoplanetary systems. AU Mic is a well-studied young star that is thought to be a prime candidate for harboring a planetary system, and a new planetary companion would confirm this hypothesis. Using high-precision radial velocity measurements with the HARPS spectrograph and radial velocity subtraction techniques, we have detected a signal that is consistent with a planetary companion with a minimum mass of 0.27 Jupiter masses and an orbital period of 8.47 days.

we described how to use the tools of geometrical engineering to deform
geometrically-engineered grand unified models into ones with lower symmetry.
This top-down unfolding has the advantage that the relative positions of
singularities giving rise to the many `low energy' matter fields are related by
only a few parameters which deform the geometry of the unified model. And
because the relative positions of singularities are necessary to compute the
superpotential, for example, this is a framework in which the arbitrariness of
geometrically engineered models can be greatly reduced.
  In our earlier paper, this picture was made concrete for the case of
deforming the representations of an SU(5) model into their Standard Model
content. In this paper we continue that discussion to show how a geometrically
engineered 16 of SO(10) can be unfolded into the Standard Model, and how the
three families of the Standard Model uniquely emerge from the unfolding of a
single, isolated E8 singularity.
","In this work, we present a novel approach to geometrically engineer the standard model by locally unfolding three families out of E8. Our methodology requires a combination of algebraic and geometric techniques to construct a new particle model that can accommodate the observed experimental data. The motivation for this research stems from the desire to address the discrepancies between the high-energy physics and the standard model.

Our approach provides a new avenue for understanding the standard model and may open a path towards a more complete theory of the universe.

The lines are associated with highly ionized Ne, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, and Fe,
some of which have been seen in earlier HETGS observations. Surprisingly,
however, we discovered dramatic variability of the lines over the duration of
the present observation. For instance, the flux of the Ne X line at 12.14 \AA\
was about $5 \times 10^{-3}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the early part of
the observation but became subsequently undetectable, with a 99% upper limit of
$0.06 \times 10^{-3}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ on the flux of the line. This
implies that the line weakened by nearly two orders of magnitude on a timescale
of hours. The overall X-ray flux of the source did also vary during the
observation but only by 20--30%. For Cyg X-1, the absorption lines are
generally attributed to the absorption of X-rays by ionized stellar wind in the
binary system. Therefore, they may provide valuable diagnostics on the physical
condition of the wind. We discuss the implications of the results.

probabilistic grounds for any individual candidate system in this separation

there is a significant probability (25%) that at least one pair of low-mass

locations of the Galactic spiral arms. The observed pattern in RMs requries the
presence of at least one large-scale magnetic reversal in the fourth Galactic
quadrant, located between the Sagittarius- Carina and Scutum-Crux spiral arms.
To quantitatively compare our measurements to other recent studies, we consider
all available extragalactic and pulsar RMs in the region we have surveyed, and
jointly fit these data to simple models in which the large-scale field follows
the spiral arms. In the best-fitting model, the magnetic field in the fourth
Galactic quadrant is directed clockwise in the Sagittarius-Carina spiral arm
(as viewed from the North Galactic pole), but is oriented counter- clockwise in
the Scutum-Crux arm. This contrasts with recent analyses of pulsar RMs alone,
in which the fourth-quadrant field was presumed to be directed
counter-clockwise in the Sagittarius- Carina arm. Also in contrast to recent
pulsar RM studies, our joint modeling of pulsar and extragalactic RMs
demonstrates that large numbers of large-scale magnetic field reversals are not
required to account for observations.

the TWA 7 disk (d=55 pc) an order of magnitude more massive than the disk
reported around AU Microscopii (GL 803), the closest (9.9 pc) debris disk
detected around an M dwarf. This is consistent with TWA 7 being slightly
younger than AU Mic. We find that the mid-IR and submillimeter data require the
disk to be comprised of dust at a range of temperatures. A model in which the
dust is at a single radius from the star, with a range of temperatures
according to grain size, is as effective at fitting the emission spectrum as a
model in which the dust is of uniform size, but has a range of temperatures
according to distance. We discuss this disk in the context of known disks in

high-quality data at low energies (below 1 keV) which are critical for reliably
modeling the spectrum of the accretion disk. A key issue examined is the
determination of the so-called ""color correction factor"", which is often
empirically introduced to account for the deviation of the local disk spectrum
from a blackbody (due to electron scattering). This factor cannot be
pre-determined theoretically because it may vary with, e.g., mass accretion
rate, among a number of important factors. We follow up on an earlier
suggestion to estimate the color correction observationally by modeling the
disk spectrum with saturated Compton scattering. We show that the spectra can
be fitted well and the approach yields reasonable values for the color
correction factor. For comparison, we have also attempted to fit the spectra

$\eta = \max\{|V_1|, |V_2|\}$, and $\delta \in (0,1/2]$), no polynomial time
algorithm can approximate $\mathcal{S}$-MWEB within a factor of $n^{\epsilon}$
for some $\epsilon > 0$ unless $\mathsf{RP = NP}$. This hardness result gives
justification of the heuristic approaches adopted for various applied problems
in the aforementioned areas, and indicates that good approximation algorithms
are unlikely to exist. Specifically, we give two applications by showing that:
1) finding statistically significant biclusters in the SAMBA model, proposed in

$n^{\epsilon}$-inapproximable; and 2) no polynomial time algorithm exists for

of the cluster of galaxies Sersic 159-03, which has a strong soft X-ray excess
emission component. The Suzaku observation confirms the presence of the soft
excess emission, but it does not confirm the presence of redshifted OVII lines
in the cluster. Radial profiles and 2D maps derived from XMM-Newton
observations show that the soft excess emission has a strong peak at the
position of the central cD galaxy and the maps do not show any significant
azimuthal variations. Although the soft excess emission can be fitted equally
well with both thermal and non-thermal models, its spatial distribution is
neither consistent with the models of intercluster warm-hot filaments, nor with
models of clumpy warm intracluster gas associated with infalling groups. Using
the data obtained by the XMM-Newton Reflection Grating Spectrometers we do not
confirm the presence of the warm gas in the cluster centre with the expected
properties assuming the soft excess is of thermal origin. The observed
properties of the soft excess emission are consistent with the non-thermal
interpretation. While the high density of relativistic electrons associated
with the peak of the soft emission in the cluster centre might have been
provided by an active galactic nucleus in the central cD galaxy, the underlying
population might have been accelerated in diffuse shocks.
","In this work, we investigate the possible non-thermal nature of the soft-excess emission in the Sersic 159-03 galaxy cluster. The soft-excess emission is a puzzling phenomenon where an excess of soft X-ray radiation is observed in the spectra of several galaxy clusters, including Sersic 159-03. This emission is believed to arise from a thermal component, but its physical origin remains unclear. We aim to test an alternative hypothesis that proposes a non-thermal mechanism to explain the soft-excess emission in Sersic 159-03. We modeled the X-ray spectra of the cluster with a thermal and non-thermal component and compared them to the observed data. We found that the non-thermal component provides a better fit to the data than the thermal component, suggesting that the soft-excess emission in Sersic 159-03 may indeed have a non-thermal origin. Our motivation for conducting this research is to understand the nature of the soft-excess emission, which has been a long-standing challenge in the study of galaxy clusters. Our findings have important implications for the current understanding of the physical processes that occur in these cosmic structures and may provide new insights into the production of non-thermal radiation.

led to a transition from the high-mass star formation mode of Pop III stars, to
the low-mass mode that dominates today. We ran hydrodynamic simulations with
cosmological initial conditions in the standard LambdaCDM model, with
metallicities, from zero to 10^-2 Zsolar, beginnning at redshift, z = 99. The
simulations were run until a dense core forms at the center of a 5 x 10^5
Msolar dark matter halo, at z ~ 18. Analysis of the central 1 Msolar core
reveals that the two simulations with the lowest metallicities, Z = 0 and 10^-4
Zsolar, contain one clump with 99% of the mass, while the two with
metallicities, Z = 10^-3 and 10^-2 Zsolar, each contain two clumps that share
most of the mass. The Z = 10^-3 Zsolar simulation also produced two low-mass
proto-stellar objects with masses between 10^-2 and 10^-1 Msolar. Gas with Z >=
10^-3 Zsolar is able to cool to the temperature of the CMB, which sets a lower
limit to the minimum fragmentation mass. This suggests that the second

massive on average than stars formed in the local universe.

color distribution of stars in the horizontal-branch (HB) phase. This
phenomenon is now best understood as due to the presence of helium enhanced
second generation subpopulations, which has raised a possibility that these
peculiar GCs might have a unique origin. Here we show that these GCs with
extended HB are clearly distinct from other normal GCs in kinematics and mass.
The GCs with extended HB are more massive than normal GCs, and are dominated by
random motion with no correlation between kinematics and metallicity.
Surprisingly, however, when they are excluded, most normal GCs in the inner
halo show clear signs of dissipational collapse that apparently led to the
formation of the disk. Normal GCs in the outer halo share their kinematic
properties with the extended HB GCs, which is consistent with the accretion
origin. Our result further suggests heterogeneous origins of GCs, and we
anticipate this to be a starting point for more detailed investigations of
Milky Way formation, including early mergers, collapse, and later accretion.
","In this study, we investigate the kinematic properties of globular clusters with extended horizontal branches (GCs-EHBs), aiming to decouple their internal kinematics from the overall Galactic motion. The motivation for this research is rooted in the fact that GCs-EHBs display complex kinematic behaviors, such as bimodality in their radial velocity distribution and non-uniform rotation patterns, which suggest the presence of subpopulations with different origins and evolutionary histories. To achieve this goal, we analyzed the multi-object spectroscopy data of 60 GCs-EHBs taken from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Survey (APOGEE-2).

composed of elastic linear-chains and rigid junctions and form a
compartmentalized structure on the surface, and for this reason the vertices of
triangles can diffuse freely only inside the compartments. As a consequence, an
inhomogeneous structure is introduced in the model; the surface strength inside
the compartments is different from the surface strength on the compartments.
However, the rotational symmetry is not influenced by the elastic skeletons;
there is no specific direction on the surface. In addition to the three phases
mentioned above, a collapsed phase is expected to exist in the low bending
rigidity regime that was not studied here. The inhomogeneous structure and the
fluidity of vertices are considered to be the origin of such variety of phases.

localized over the sites of a lattice and the local stochastic updating rules
are inspired on the processes of the Lotka-Volterra model. Two levels of
mean-field approximations are set up. The simple approximation is equivalent to
an extended patch model, a simple metapopulation model with patches colonized
by prey, patches colonized by predators and empty patches. This approximation
is capable of describing the limited available space for species occupancy. The
pair approximation is moreover able to describe two types of coexistence of
prey and predators: one where population densities are constant in time and
another displaying self-sustained time-oscillations of the population
densities. The oscillations are associated with limit cycles and arise through
a Hopf bifurcation. They are stable against changes in the initial conditions
and, in this sense, they differ from the Lotka-Volterra cycles which depend on
initial conditions. In this respect, the present model is biologically more
realistic than the Lotka-Volterra model.

white dwarfs with a rotational period shorter than the binary orbital period.
Evolutionary theory predicts that IPs with long orbital periods evolve through
the 2-3 hour period gap, but it is very uncertain what the properties of the
resulting objects are. Whilst a relatively large number of long-period IPs are
known, very few of these have short orbital periods. We present phase-resolved
spectroscopy and photometry of SDSS J233325.92+152222.1 and classify it as the
IP with the shortest known orbital period (83.12 +/- 0.09 min), which contains
a white dwarf with a relatively long spin period (41.66 +/- 0.13 min). We
estimate the white dwarf's magnetic moment to be mu(WD) \approx 2 x 10^33 G
cm^3, which is not only similar to three of the other four confirmed
short-period IPs but also to those of many of the long-period IPs. We suggest
that long-period IPs conserve their magnetic moment as they evolve towards
shorter orbital periods. Therefore the dominant population of long-period IPs,
which have white dwarf spin periods roughly ten times shorter than their
orbital periods, will likely end up as short-period IPs like SDSS J2333, with
spin periods a large fraction of their orbital periods.

Array (SMA) at sub-arcsecond spatial resolution. The observations resolved the
hot molecular core into six submm continuum sources with the finest spatial
resolution of 0.36''x0.25'' (~1800AU) achieved so far. Four of them located
within 7800(AU)^2 comprise a proto-Trapezium system with estimated protostellar
densities of 1.4x0^5 protostars/pc^3. The plethora of ~80 spectral lines allows
us to study the molecular outflow(s), the core kinematics, the temperature
structure of the region as well as chemical effects. The derived hot core
temperatures are of the order 300K. We find interesting chemical spatial
differentiations, e.g., C34S is deficient toward the hot core and is enhanced
at the UCHII/hot core interface, which may be explained by temperature
sensitive desorption from grains and following gas phase chemistry. The
SiO(8-7) emission outlines likely two molecular outflows emanating from this
hot core region. Emission from most other molecules peaks centrally on the hot
core and is not dominated by any individual submm peak. Potential reasons for
that are discussed. A few spectral lines that are associated with the main
submm continuum source, show a velocity gradient perpendicular to the
large-scale outflow. Since this velocity structure comprises three of the
central protostellar sources, this is not a Keplerian disk. While the data are
consistent with a gas core that may rotate and/or collapse, we cannot exclude
the outflow(s) and/or nearby expanding UCHII region as possible alternative
causes of this velocity pattern.

one-to-many throughput capacity) of IEEE 802.11 multi-hop networks. It has
generally been assumed in prior studies that the many-to-one throughput
capacity is upper-bounded by the link capacity L. Throughput capacity L is not
achievable under 802.11. This paper introduces the notion of ""canonical
networks"", which is a class of regularly-structured networks whose capacities
can be analyzed more easily than unstructured networks. We show that the
throughput capacity of canonical networks under 802.11 has an analytical upper
bound of 3L/4 when the source nodes are two or more hops away from the sink;
and simulated throughputs of 0.690L (0.740L) when the source nodes are many
hops away. We conjecture that 3L/4 is also the upper bound for general
networks. When all links have equal length, 2L/3 can be shown to be the upper
bound for general networks. Our simulations show that 802.11 networks with
random topologies operated with AODV routing can only achieve throughputs far
below the upper bounds. Fortunately, by properly selecting routes near the
gateway (or by properly positioning the relay nodes leading to the gateway) to
fashion after the structure of canonical networks, the throughput can be
improved significantly by more than 150%. Indeed, in a dense network, it is
worthwhile to deactivate some of the relay nodes near the sink judiciously.

done in the normal liquid state, the simulations provided the determination of
both self-diffusion and interdiffusion constants in the undercooled regime as
well. The simulation results show good agreement with the experimental data. In
the temperature range 3000 K >= T >= 715 K, the interdiffusion coefficient is
larger than the self-diffusion constants. Furthermore the simulation shows that
this difference becomes larger in the undercooled regime. This result can be
refered to a relatively strong temperature dependence of the thermodynamic
factor \Phi, which describes the thermodynamic driving force for
interdiffusion. The simulations also indicate that the Darken equation is a
good approximation, even in the undercooled regime. This implies that dynamic
cross correlations play a minor role for the temperature range under

with INTEGRAL and a confirmed member of the new class of High Mass X-ray
Binaries, the Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients (SFXTs). Archival INTEGRAL data
and RXTE observations showed that the outbursts occur with a periodicity of
~330 days. Thus, IGR J11215-5952 is the first SFXT displaying periodic
outbursts, possibly related to the orbital period. We performed a Target of
Opportunity observation with Swift with the main aim of monitoring the source
behaviour around the time of the fifth outburst, expected on 2007 Feb 9. The
source field was observed with Swift twice a day (2ks/day) starting from 4th
February, 2007, until the fifth outburst, and then for ~5 ks a day afterwards,
during a monitoring campaign that lasted 23 days for a total on-source exposure
of ~73 ks. This is the most complete monitoring campaign of an outburst from a
SFXT. The spectrum during the brightest flares is well described by an absorbed
power law with a photon index of 1 and N_H~1 10^22 cm^-2. A 1-10 keV peak
luminosity of ~10^36 erg s^-1 was derived (assuming 6.2 kpc, the distance of
the optical counterpart). These Swift observations are a unique data-set for an
outburst of a SFXT, thanks to the combination of sensitivity and time coverage,
and they allowed a study of IGR J11215-5952 from outburst onset to almost
quiescence. We find that the accretion phase lasts longer than previously
thought on the basis of lower sensitivity instruments observing only the
brightest flares. The observed phenomenology is consistent with a smoothly
increasing flux triggered at the periastron passage in a wide eccentric orbit
with many flares superimposed, possibly due to episodic or inhomogeneous
accretion.
","In this work, we present the analysis of the fifth outburst of IGR J11215-5952, a Supergiant Fast X-ray Transient. This periodic transient was discovered in 2004 and shows recurrent outbursts with a period of approximately 165 days. This periodic transient was detected and monitored by the Swift/XRT telescope in December 2020, and it lasted for about 7 days. The observations of the periodic outbursts of IGR J11215-5952 provide a unique opportunity to study the physics of Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients, and additional monitoring campaigns are needed to shed light on the nature of these sources. The goal of this study is to analyze the timing and spectral properties of the source during the outburst and to compare them with the previous ones.

[SIII] (18um/33um) infrared line flux ratios, traditionally used to estimate
the density of the ionized gas, in a sample of 41 Type 1 and Type 2 active
galactic nuclei (AGNs) observed with the Infrared Spectrograph on board
Spitzer. The majority of galaxies with both [NeV] lines detected have observed
[NeV] line flux ratios consistent with or below the theoretical low density
limit, based on calculations using currently available collision strengths and
ignoring absorption and stimulated emission. We find that Type 2 AGNs have
lower line flux ratios than Type 1 AGNs and that all of the galaxies with line
flux ratios below the low density limit are Type 2 AGNs. We argue that
differential infrared extinction to the [NeV] emitting region due to dust in
the obscuring torus is responsible for the ratios below the low density limit
and we suggest that the ratio may be a tracer of the inclination angle of the
torus to our line of sight. Because the temperature of the gas, the amount of
extinction, and the effect of absorption and stimulated emission on the line
ratios are all unknown, we are not able to determine the electron densities
associated with the [NeV] line flux ratios for the objects in our sample. We
also find that the [SIII] emission from the galaxies in our sample is extended
and originates primarily in star forming regions. Since the emission from
low-ionization species is extended, any analysis using line flux ratios from
such species obtained from slits of different sizes is invalid for most nearby
galaxies.

We interpret this observation as evidence for the torus as the responsible structure. The torus is a hypothesized dusty structure surrounding the central engine of an AGN. Its line-of-sight obscuration can affect the observed properties of AGNs, including their mid-infrared line ratios, which are considered to be powerful diagnostics of their physical conditions.

vector bosons caused by spontaneous Lorentz invariance violation (SLIV). To
this end, the SLIV which evolves in a general Yang-Mills type theory with the
nonlinear vector field constraint $Tr(% \boldsymbol{A}_{\mu
}\boldsymbol{A}^{\mu})=\pm M^{2}$ ($M$ is a proposed SLIV scale) imposed is
considered in detail. With an internal symmetry group $G$ having $D$ generators
not only the pure Lorentz symmetry SO(1,3), but the larger accidental symmetry
$SO(D,3D)$ of the SLIV constraint in itself appears to be spontaneously broken
as well. As a result, while the pure Lorentz violation still generates only one
genuine Goldstone vector boson, the accompanying pseudo-Goldstone vector bosons
related to the $SO(D,3D)$ breaking also come into play in the final arrangement
of the entire Goldstone vector field multiplet. Remarkably, they remain
strictly massless, being protected by gauge invariance of the Yang-Mills theory
involved. We show that, although this theory contains a plethora of Lorentz and
$CPT$ violating couplings, they do not lead to physical SLIV effects which turn
out to be strictly cancelled in all the lowest order processes considered.
However, the physical Lorentz violation could appear if the internal gauge
invariance were slightly broken at very small distances influenced by gravity.
For the SLIV scale comparable with the Planck one the Lorentz violation could
become directly observable at low energies.
","In this paper, we explore the phenomenon of spontaneous Lorentz violation through the lens of non-Abelian gauge fields as pseudo-Goldstone vector bosons. The key idea behind our work is that the breaking of Lorentz symmetry can be manifested in the effective dynamics of gauge fields which undergo spontaneous symmetry breaking. We use a combination of analytical and numerical techniques to demonstrate how the non-Abelian gauge fields can arise as a result of spontaneous Lorentz violation. We rely on the so-called Stückelberg mechanism, which allows for the introduction of additional degrees of freedom in the theory. In this paper, we explore the phenomenon of spontaneous Lorentz violation through the lens of non-Abelian gauge fields as pseudo-Goldstone vector bosons.

relativistic transport approach, we see that the density dependence of the {\it
inelastic} cross sections appreciably affects the pion and kaon yields and
their rapidity distributions. However, the $(\pi^{-}/\pi^{+})$- and
$(K^{0}/K^{+})$-ratios depend only moderately on the in-medium behavior of the
inelastic cross sections. This is particularly true for kaon yield ratios,
since kaons are more uniformly produced in high density regions. Kaon
potentials are also suitably evaluated in two schemes, a chiral perturbative
approach and an effective meson-quark coupling method, with consistent results
showing a similar repulsive contribution for $K^{+}$ and $K^{0}$. As a
consequence we expect rather reduced effects on the yield ratios. We conclude
that particle ratios appear to be robust observables for probing the nuclear

vertex operators, $P_{\frac{1}{m}}(z)$, that replace a subset of the electron
operators in the correlator. The one-quasiparticle wave function is identical
to the corresponding CF wave function, and the two-quasiparticle wave function
has correct fractional charge and statistics and is numerically almost
identical to the corresponding CF wave function. We further show how to exactly
represent the CF wavefunctions in the Jain series $\nu = s/(2sp+1)$ as the CFT
correlators of a new type of fermionic vertex operators, $V_{p,n}(z)$,
constructed from $n$ free compactified bosons; these operators provide the CFT
representation of composite fermions carrying $2p$ flux quanta in the $n^{\rm

time-scales of about 4-8 x 10^4 yr from the stellar explosion. Sputtering by
the hot gas induces a shift of the dust size distribution towards smaller
grains. The resulting dust extinction curve shows a good agreement with that
derived by observations of a reddened QSO at z =6.2. Stochastic heating of
small grains leads to a wide distribution of dust temperatures. This supports
the idea that large amounts (~ 0.1 M_sun) of cold dust (T ~ 40K) can be present
in SN remnants, without being in conflict with the observed IR emission.

leads to a universal scaling behavior for the dipole scattering amplitude. The
running coupling corrections calculated recently significantly change the shape
of the scaling function as compared to the fixed coupling case leading to a
considerable increase in the anomalous dimension and to a slow-down of the
evolution with rapidity. The difference between the two recent calculations is
due to an extra contribution to the evolution kernel, referred to as the
subtraction term, which arises when running coupling corrections are included.
These subtraction terms were neglected in both recent calculations. We evaluate
numerically the subtraction terms for both calculations, and demonstrate that
when the subtraction terms are added back to the evolution kernels obtained in
the two works the resulting dipole amplitudes agree with each other! We then
use the complete running coupling kernel including the subtraction term to find
the numerical solution of the resulting full non-linear evolution equation with
the running coupling corrections. Again the scaling regime is recovered at very
large rapidity.

both in the continuum and in CO. We find strong evidence that the circumstellar
material is in Keplerian rotation around a central star of 2.6 Msun. The disk
inclination with respect to the line of sight is 46+-4 deg with a position
angle of 128+-4 deg. The slope of the dust opacity measured between 0.87 and 7

The dust continuum emission is asymmetric and confined inside a radius of 200

arise from a change in the higgsino mass parameter mu, which enters both via
higher-order radiative corrections and via the kinematics of Higgs decays into

prospective discovery reach (and correspondingly the ``LHC wedge'' region) by
about Delta tan_beta = 10, we find that the discovery reach is rather stable

step-edge diffusion is the dominant mass-transport mechanism, we find that
significant deviations from the usual $t^{1/4}$ scaling of the terrace-width
correlation function occurs for a critical time $\tau$ which is dependent upon
the three energy scales in the problem: $k_{B}T$, the step stiffness, $\gamma$,
and the bias associated with adatom hopping under the influence of an
electromigration force, $\pm \Delta U$. For ($t < \tau$), the correlation
function evolves as a superposition of $t^{1/4}$ and $t^{3/4}$ power laws. For
$t \ge \tau$ a closed form expression can be derived. This behavior is
confirmed by a Monte-Carlo simulation using a discrete model of the step

acting upon an atom at a step-edge can by estimated by a careful analysis of
the statistical properties of step-edge fluctuations on the appropriate

wavelet analysis, we examine the three-year WMAP and the NVSS data for
correlation induced by the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect. The steerable
wavelet constructed from the second derivative of a Gaussian allows one to
define three local morphological measures, namely the signed-intensity,
orientation and elongation of local features. Detections of correlation between
the WMAP and NVSS data are made with each of these morphological measures. The
most significant detection is obtained in the correlation of the
signed-intensity of local features at a significance of 99.9%. By inspecting
signed-intensity sky maps, it is possible for the first time to see the
correlation between the WMAP and NVSS data by eye. Foreground contamination and
instrumental systematics in the WMAP data are ruled out as the source of all
significant detections of correlation. Our results provide new insight on the
ISW effect by probing the morphological nature of the correlation induced
between the cosmic microwave background and large scale structure of the
Universe. Given the current constraints on the flatness of the Universe, our
detection of the ISW effect again provides direct and independent evidence for
dark energy. Moreover, this new morphological analysis may be used in future to
help us to better understand the nature of dark energy.

goals: 1) detecting and characterizing low-mass planets increasingly similar to
the Earth, and 2) improving our understanding of planet formation. We present a
new planet detection method that is capable of making large advances towards
both of these objectives and describe a modest network of telescopes that is
able to make the requisite observations. In a system where a known planet
transits its host star, a second planet in that system will cause the time
between transits to vary. These transit timing variations can be used to infer
the orbital elements and mass of the perturbing planet even if it has a mass
that is smaller than the mass of the Earth. This detection technique
complements other techniques because it is most sensitive in mean-motion
resonances where, due to degeneracies, other techniques have reduced
sensitivity. Small ground-based observatories have already exceeded the
photometric precision necessary to detect sub-Earth mass planets. However, TTV
planet searches are currently limited by the relatively small number of
high-precision transit data and insufficient observing time on existing
telescopes. These issues will be compounded as the number of known transiting
planets suitable for TTV study will increase substantially in the near future.
A relatively modest investment in a ground-based network of small ($\sim 0.5
{\rm m}$ telescopes could provide the needed coverage and so dramatically
increase the effectiveness of transit timing observations.

framework for the calculation of protein mechanical response that facilitates
the incorporation of specific atomic-level interactions into the model,

the Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (\textit{TRACE}). We apply to these
loops the same procedure followed in our previous works, and we compare the
results with real loop observations. We demonstrate that the procedure allows
us to distinguish constant width loops from loops that expand appreciably with
height, as predicted by simple force-free field models. This holds even for
loops near the resolution limit. The procedure can easily determine when loops
are below resolution limit and therefore not reliably measured. We find that
small-scale variations in the measured loop width are likely due to
imperfections in the background subtraction. The greatest errors occur in
especially narrow loops and in places where the background is especially bright
relative to the loop. We stress, however, that these effects do not impact the
ability to measure large-scale variations. The result that observed loops do
not expand systematically with height is robust.

observations presents a unique way to test certain features of string theory.
Current limit on the ratio of tensor to scalar perturbations, r=T/S, is r <

known string theory inflation models predict tensor modes well below the level
of detection. Therefore a possible experimental discovery of tensor modes may
present a challenge to string cosmology.
  The strongest bound on r in string inflation follows from the observation
that in most of the models based on the KKLT construction, the value of the
Hubble constant H during inflation must be smaller than the gravitino mass. For
the gravitino mass in the usual range, m_{3/2} < O(1) TeV, this leads to an
extremely strong bound r < 10^{-24}. A discovery of tensor perturbations with r

superheavy, m_{3/2} > 10^{13} GeV. This would have important implications for
particle phenomenology based on string theory.

behavioral response has been proposed. A neural circuit can be thought of as a
directed multigraph whose each vertex is a neuron and each edge is a synapse.
It has been assumed in this paper that the behavior of such circuits is
manifested through the collective behavior of neurons belonging to that
circuit. Behavioral information of each neuron is contained in the coefficients
of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) over the output spike train. Those
coefficients form a vector in a multidimensional vector space. Behavioral
dynamics of a neuronal network in response to strong aversive stimuli has been
studied in a vector space in which a suitable pseudometric has been defined.
The neurodynamical model of network behavior has been formulated in terms of
existing memory, synaptic plasticity and feelings. The model has an analogy in
classical electrostatics, by which the notion of force and potential energy has
been introduced. Since the model takes input from each neuron in a network and
produces a behavior as the output, it would be extremely difficult or may even
be impossible to implement. But with the help of the model a possible
explanation for an hitherto unexplained neurological observation in human brain
has been offered. The model is compatible with a recent model of sequential
behavioral dynamics. The model is based on electrophysiology, but its relevance
to hemodynamics has been outlined.
","In this study, we present a neurodynamical model of behavioral response to strong aversive stimuli. The model is based on the assumption that the brain works as a complex network of interacting components with multiple timescales that together give rise to the observed behavior. Specifically, we propose that the behavior of the organism can be decomposed into three main stages: an initial phase of orienting towards the stimulus, a second stage of avoidance or escape, and a third stage of recovery or adaptation to the context. To test our model, we simulated the behavior of a virtual organism exposed to a series of aversive stimuli of increasing intensity. Our results show that the model can account for a wide range of behavioral responses, from freezing or immobility to active avoidance or escape, depending on the parameters of the stimulus and the state of the organism. The motivation for this research is twofold. On the one hand, we aim to provide a better understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying aversive behavior, which may help to develop more effective therapeutic interventions for anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder and other conditions. On the other hand, we hope to contribute to the growing field of neurodynamics, which seeks to bridge the gap between neuroscience and complex systems theory and sheds light on the intricate interplay between brain and behavior.

of supernova (SN) feedback and study how galactic winds from star-forming
galaxies affect the features of hydrogen (HI) and metal (CIV and OVI)
absorption systems in the intergalactic medium at high redshift. We find that
the outflows tend to escape to low density regions, and hardly affect the dense
filaments visible in HI absorption. As a result, the strength of HI absorption
near galaxies is not reduced by galactic winds, but even slightly increases. We
also find that a lack of HI absorption for lines of sight (LOS) close to
galaxies, as found by Adelberger et al., can be created by hot gas around the
galaxies induced by accretion shock heating. In contrast to HI, metal
absorption systems are sensitive to the presence of winds. The models without
feedback can produce the strong CIV and OVI absorption lines in LOS within 50
kpc from galaxies, while strong SN feedback is capable of creating strong CIV
and OVI lines out to about twice that distance. We also analyze the mean
transmissivity of HI, CIV, and OVI within 1 h$^{-1}$ Mpc from star-forming
galaxies. The probability distribution of the transmissivity of HI is
independent of the strength of SN feedback, but strong feedback produces LOS
with lower transmissivity of metal lines. Additionally, strong feedback can
produce strong OVI lines even in cases where HI absorption is weak. We conclude
that OVI is probably the best tracer for galactic winds at high redshift.
","In this work, we investigate the signatures of galactic winds around high redshift galaxies. We obtained data from the Keck and Subaru telescopes, including deep imaging and spectroscopy, to identify galaxies at redshifts between 2.2 and 3.5. We then analyzed their spectra to look for evidence of gas outflows, which are thought to play a crucial role in regulating star formation and galaxy evolution. The problem that this work attempts to solve is understanding the role that galactic winds play in shaping the properties of high redshift galaxies. These winds are thought to be a key mechanism for regulating star formation, but their properties and prevalence are not yet well understood. Our methodology involves a combination of deep imaging and spectroscopy of high-redshift galaxies, coupled with detailed modeling of their properties and the outflows that they host. We use our observations to constrain the properties of the outflows, including their kinematics, mass and energy. By examining the relationships between outflow properties and galaxy properties, we aim to shed new light on the physical processes driving galaxy evolution in the early universe.

confirmed objects, we find six statistically significant candidate Ly-alpha
emission line objects. The candidates are identified as having wavelengths
close to the DLA line where the background quasar emission is absorbed. In
comparison with the six currently known Ly-alpha emitting DLA galaxies the
candidates have similar line fluxes and line widths, while velocity offsets
between the emission lines and systemic DLA redshifts are larger. The impact
parameters are larger than 10 kpc, and lower column density systems are found
at larger impact parameters. Assuming that a single gas cloud extends from the
QSO line of sight to the location of the candidate emission line, we find that
the average candidate DLA galaxy is surrounded by neutral gas with an

This method allows for simultaneous measurement of both spatial and spectral information, providing a rich dataset for detailed analysis.

We selected a sample of 24 DLA galaxies at redshifts between 2 and 4 using a combination of imaging and spectroscopic data.

quasars, although they represent only 2% of all sources in the adopted
flux-limited sample. We find that at least 90% of quasars are variable at the
0.03 mag level (rms) and confirm that variability is as good a method for
finding low-redshift quasars as is the UV excess color selection (at high
Galactic latitudes). We analyze the distribution of lightcurve skewness for
quasars and find that is centered on zero. We find that about 1/4 of the
variable stars are RR Lyrae stars, and that only 0.5% of stars from the main
stellar locus are variable at the 0.05 mag level. The distribution of
lightcurve skewness in the g-r vs. u-g color-color diagram on the main stellar

the hot Local Bubble (LB) plasma, assuming that the cloud is evaporating
because of thermal conduction. We create a grid of models covering a plausible

radiative transfer/thermal equilibrium calculations using the Cloudy code. Data
from in situ observations of He^O, pickup ions and anomalous cosmic rays in the

constrain the input parameters. A restricted range of assumed LIC HI column
densities and LB plasma temperatures produce models that match all the

suggests low-metallicity to be a condition for a massive star to evolve to the

evolutionary stages is likely to rule out helium stars with main-sequence
companions as progenitors of hypernovae/GRBs. On the other hand, helium stars
in close binaries with a neutron-star or black-hole companion can, despite the
strong core-envelope coupling in the post-helium burning phase, retain
sufficient core angular momentum to produce a hypernova/GRB.

complemented by semi-empirical quantum mechanical calculations for the states

describe electron hopping in the presence of environmental effects, such as the
presence of stray water molecules on the backbone or structural features of the

leads to electron localization. The localization length is smaller by several

achieved when the signal distribution is Jeffrey's prior, as formed from the
noise distribution, or when the noise distribution depends on the signal
distribution via a cosine relationship. These results provide theoretical
verification and justification for previous work in both computational

To investigate these different alignment types, we analyzed the large-scale dark matter structure, identified and classified halos as central or satellite, and compared their orientation with their respective galaxies. Our results show that radial alignment, where galaxies align with the direction towards their host halo center, is the dominant alignment signal for satellite galaxies. Contrariwise, central galaxies exhibit preferentially parallel alignment—where galaxies tend to align with the orientation of their host halo's major axis. Our motivation lay in exploring the various mechanisms that drive galaxy alignment, which are still not well understood. Our results can help shape current models and theories used to understand the evolution of galaxies in a cosmic context.

investigate the possibility that it may have had its origin in the massive OB
association Cygnus OB2.
  Methods: We present new spectroscopic observations allowing a reliable
spectral classification of the star, and discuss existing MSX observations of
its associated bow shock and astrometric information not previously studied.
  Results: Our observations reveal that BD+43 3654 is a very early and luminous
star of spectral type O4If, with an estimated mass of (70 +/- 15) solar masses
and an age of about 1.6 Myr. The high spatial resolution of the MSX
observations allows us to determine its direction of motion in the plane of the
sky by means of the symmetry axis of the well-defined bow shock, which matches
well the orientation expected from the proper motion. Tracing back its path
across the sky we find that BD+43 3654 was located near the central, densest
region of Cygnus OB2 at a time in the past similar to its estimated age.
  Conclusions: BD+43 3654 turns out to be one of the three most massive runaway
stars known, and it most likely formed in the central region of Cygnus OB2. A
runaway formation mechanism by means of dynamical ejection is consistent with
our results.

Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix including the CP violating phase are
determined by the CKM element |V_{us}| and the ratio of two vacuum expectation
values R=|R|e^{i*alpha} (a magnitude and a phase). It is demonstrated how the
angles phi_i (i=1--3) of the unitarity triangle and the CKM off-diagonal

techniques, we prove that the actual motions of the piston converge in
probability to the predicted averaged behavior on the time scale $M^ {1/2} $
when $M$ tends to infinity while the total energy of the system is bounded and
the number of gas particles is fixed. Neishtadt and Sinai previously pointed
out that an averaging theorem due to Anosov should extend to this situation.
  When $ d=1$, the gas particles move in just one dimension, and we prove that
the rate of convergence of the actual motions of the piston to its averaged
behavior is $\mathcal{O} (M^ {-1/2}) $ on the time scale $M^ {1/2} $. The
convergence is uniform over all initial conditions in a compact set. We also
investigate the piston system when the particle interactions have been
smoothed. The convergence to the averaged behavior again takes place uniformly,
both over initial conditions and over the amount of smoothing.

point mass with a disk in Newtonian gravitational theory. A particle motion in
this system can be chaotic when the gravitational contribution from a surface
density of a disk is comparable with that from a point mass. In such an orbit,
we sometimes find that there appears a phase of the orbit in which particle
motion becomes to be nearly regular (the so-called ``stagnant motion'') for a
finite time interval between more strongly chaotic phases. To study how these
different chaotic behaviours affect on observation of gravitational waves, we
investigate a correlation of the particle motion and the waves. We find that
such a difference in chaotic motions reflects on the wave forms and energy
spectra. The character of the waves in the stagnant motion is quite different
from that either in a regular motion or in a more strongly chaotic motion. This
suggests that we may make a distinction between different chaotic behaviours of
the orbit via the gravitational waves.

suggested that the power spectral density (PSD) of NGC 3783 flattens to a slope
near zero at low frequencies, in a similar manner to that of Galactic black
hole X-ray binary systems (GBHs) in the `hard' state. The low radio flux
emitted by this object, however, is inconsistent with a hard state
interpretation. The accretion rate of NGC 3783 (~7% of the Eddington rate) is
similar to that of other AGN with `soft' state PSDs and higher than that at
which the GBH Cyg X-1, with which AGN are often compared, changes between
`hard' and `soft' states (~2% of the Eddington rate). If NGC 3783 really does
have a `hard' state PSD, it would be quite unusual and would indicate that AGN
and GBHs are not quite as similar as we currently believe. Here we present an
improved X-ray PSD of NGC 3783, spanning from ~10^{-8} to ~10^{-3} Hz, based on
considerably extended (5.5 years) RXTE observations combined with two orbits of
continuous observation by XMM-Newton. We show that this PSD is, in fact, well
fitted by a `soft' state model which has only one break, at high frequencies.
Although a `hard' state model can also fit the data, the improvement in fit by
adding a second break at low frequency is not significant. Thus NGC 3783 is not
unusual. These results leave Arakelian 564 as the only AGN which shows a second
break at low frequencies, although in that case the very high accretion rate
implies a `very high', rather than `hard' state PSD. The break frequency found
in NGC 3783 is consistent with the expectation based on comparisons with other
AGN and GBHs, given its black hole mass and accretion rate.

makes it exceedingly difficult for routers to examine every packet in order to
keep detailed statistics about the traffic which is traversing the router.
Sampling is commonly applied on routers in order to limit the load incurred by
the collection of information that the router has to undertake when evaluating
flow information for monitoring purposes. The sampling process in nearly all
cases is a deterministic process of choosing 1 in every N packets on a
per-interface basis, and then forming the flow statistics based on the
collected sampled statistics. Even though this sampling may not be significant
for some statistics, such as packet rate, others can be severely distorted.
However, it is important to consider the sampling techniques and their relative
accuracy when applied to different traffic patterns. The main disadvantage of
sampling is the loss of accuracy in the collected trace when compared to the
original traffic stream. To date there has not been a detailed analysis of the
impact of sampling at a router in various traffic profiles and flow criteria.
In this paper, we assess the performance of the sampling process as used in
NetFlow in detail, and we discuss some techniques for the compensation of loss
of monitoring detail.

defined but the properties of each subsystem are not. Entanglement is at the
heart of quantum physics, both for its conceptual foundations and for
applications in information processing and quantum communication. Remarkably,
entanglement can be ""swapped"": if one prepares two independent entangled pairs
A1-A2 and B1-B2, a joint measurement on A1 and B1 (called a ""Bell-State
Measurement"", BSM) has the effect of projecting A2 and B2 onto an entangled
state, although these two particles have never interacted or shared any common
past[1,2]. Experiments using twin photons produced by spontaneous parametric
down-conversion (SPDC) have already demonstrated entanglement swapping[3-6],
but here we present its first realization using continuous wave (CW) sources,
as originally proposed[2]. The challenge was to achieve sufficiently sharp
synchronization of the photons in the BSM. Using narrow-band filters, the
coherence time of the photons that undergo the BSM is significantly increased,
exceeding the temporal resolution of the detectors. Hence pulsed sources can be
replaced by CW sources, which do not require any synchronization[6,7], allowing
for the first time the use of completely autonomous sources. Our experiment
exploits recent progress in the time precision of photon detectors, in the
efficiency of photon pair production by SPDC with waveguides in nonlinear
crystals[8], and in the stability of narrow-band filters. This approach is
independent of the form of entanglement; we employed time-bin entangled
photons[9] at telecom wavelengths. Our setup is robust against thermal or

propagate from Alice or Bob's changing magnetic field, through space, to the
other detector, arriving before the particle and thereby allowing a local

Neptune-mass planets with separations of several AU are common. Microlensing is
sensitive to planets that are generally inaccessible to other methods, in
particular cool planets at or beyond the snowline, very low-mass (i.e.
terrestrial) planets, planets orbiting low-mass stars, free-floating planets,
and even planets in external galaxies. Such planets can provide critical
constraints on models of planet formation, and therefore the next generation of
extrasolar planet searches should include an aggressive and well-funded
microlensing component. When combined with the results from other complementary
surveys, next generation microlensing surveys can yield an accurate and
complete census of the frequency and properties of planets, and in particular
low-mass terrestrial planets.

activities co-exist. The ionization structure is maintained by both the AGN
power-law continuum and starburst. The galaxy is a bright X-ray source
possessing a low X-ray column density N_H < 4 x 10^20 cm^{-2}. The Compton-thin
nature of such unabsorbed objects infers that the simple formulation of the
Unified model for SyGs is not applicable in their case. The main goal of this
article is to investigate both gas distribution and ionization structure in the
circumnuclear region of NGC 7679 in search for the presence of a hidden Sy1
nucleus, using the [O III] 5007 luminosity as a tracer of AGN activity. The [O
III] 5007 image of the NGC 7679 shows elliptical isophotes extended along the
PA ~ 80 deg in the direction to the counterpart galaxy NGC 7682. The maximum of
ionization by the AGN power-law continuum traced by [O III] 5007/Halpha ratio
is displaced by ~ 13 arcsec eastward from the nucleus. We conclude that the
dust and gas in the high ionization direction has a direct view to the central
AGN engine. This possibly results in dust/star-formation decay. A large
fraction of the unabsorbed Compton-thin Sy2s with [O III] luminosity > 10^41
erg s^{-1} possesses a hidden AGN source (abridged).
","In this study, we have investigated the luminous infrared composite Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 7679 through the [O III] 5007 emission line. Our main aim was to gain insight into the physical properties of this galaxy's ionized gas and its origin. To achieve this, we used a combination of spectroscopic and imaging data obtained from the Gemini MultiObject Spectrograph Integral Field Unit (GMOS-IFU) and the Hubble Space Telescope. Our analysis revealed that the ionized gas in NGC 7679 is likely to be powered by the active galactic nucleus (AGN), with a strong contribution from star formation in the galaxy. We found that the [O III] emission is highly concentrated in the nucleus, with evidence of outflows and shock-heated gas in the inner region. This suggests that the AGN is driving gas out of the galaxy, which has important implications for galaxy evolution. Overall, our study provides new insights into the complex interplay between AGNs, star formation and gas kinematics in NGC 7679.

local galaxy density, distance from the nearest cluster centre, local surface
mass density from weak lensing, and photometric classification. At high local
galaxy densities, log(Sigma_10 /Mpc^2) > 1.5, a classical morphology-density
relation is found. A correlation is also found between morphology and local
projected surface mass density, but no trend is observed with distance to the
nearest cluster. This supports the finding that local environment is more
important to galaxy morphology than global cluster properties. The breakdown of
the morphological catalogue by colour shows a dominance of blue galaxies in the
galaxies displaying late-type morphologies and a corresponding dominance of red
galaxies in the early-type population. Using the 17-band photometry from
COMBO-17, we further split the supercluster red sequence into old passive
galaxies and galaxies with young stars and dust according to the prescription

incoming characteristic fields, Sommerfeld boundary conditions, and the
constraint-preserving boundary conditions of Kreiss and Winicour. Rather
different approaches to boundary treatments, such as sponge layers and spatial

high uncertainty and correlation among the errors is expected, a careful

correlation between star formation rate and gas surface or volume density,
depend on the molecular line chosen to trace the gas. We show that, for lines
that can be excited at low temperatures, the KS law depends on how the line
critical density compares to the median density in a galaxy's star-forming
molecular clouds. High critical density lines trace regions with similar
physical properties across galaxy types, and this produces a linear correlation
between line luminosity and star formation rate. Low critical density lines
probe regions whose properties vary across galaxies, leading to a star
formation rate that varies superlinearly with line luminosity. We show that a
simple model in which molecular clouds are treated as isothermal and homogenous
can quantitatively reproduce the observed correlations between galactic
luminosities in far infrared and in the CO(1->0) and HCN(1->0) lines, and
naturally explains why these correlations have different slopes. We predict
that IR-line luminosity correlations should change slope for galaxies in which
the median density is close to the line critical density. This prediction may
be tested by observations of lines such as HCO^+(1->0) with intermediate
critical densities, or by HCN(1->0) observations of intensely star-forming high
redshift galaxies with very high densities. Recent observations by Gao et al.
hint at just such a change in slope. We argue that deviations from linearity in
the HCN(1->0)-IR correlation at high luminosity are consistent with the
assumption of a constant star formation efficiency.
","The primary motivation for this study is to establish the correlation between molecular gas content and the Kennicutt-Schmidt laws. Molecular gas tracers have been extensively used to estimate the molecular gas content in various galaxies, which is an essential factor in studying star formation. On the other hand, the Kennicutt-Schmidt laws provide a quantitative understanding of the star formation rate (SFR) per unit area of the gas density. Therefore, understanding their mutual relationship is crucial to formulate a complete understanding of the star formation process. We attempt to solve this problem by performing a comprehensive analysis of the data obtained from various galaxies. We use publicly available datasets that contain information about molecular gas content and SFR. After compiling and standardizing these data, we perform a thorough statistical analysis to determine the relationship between molecular gas tracers and the Kennicutt-Schmidt laws. We observe that the SFR is proportional to the molecular gas density raised to a power of 1.5- 2. This finding supports the well-accepted notion that star formation is closely linked to the molecular gas density.

recovers information about fluctuations lost in passing to the reduced density
matrix. For the case of fluctuations arising from a classical probability
distribution, the hierarchy is formed from expectations of products of pure
state density matrix elements, and can be compactly summarized by a simple
generating function. For the case of quantum fluctuations arising when a
quantum system interacts with a quantum environment in an overall pure state,
the corresponding hierarchy is defined as the environmental trace of products
of system matrix elements of the full density matrix. Only the lowest member of
the quantum noise hierarchy is directly experimentally measurable. The unit
trace and idempotence properties of the pure state density matrix imply descent
relations for the tensor hierarchies, that relate the order $n$ tensor, under
contraction of appropriate pairs of tensor indices, to the order $n-1$ tensor.
As examples to illustrate the classical probability distribution formalism, we
consider a quantum system evolving by It\^o stochastic and by jump process
Schr\""odinger equations. As examples to illustrate the corresponding trace
formalism in the quantum fluctuation case, we consider collisional Brownian
motion of an infinite mass Brownian particle, and the weak coupling Born-Markov
master equation. In different specializations, the latter gives the hierarchies
generalizing the quantum optical master equation and the Caldeira--Leggett
master equation. As a further application of the density tensor, we contrast
stochastic Schr\""odinger equations that reduce and that do not reduce the state
vector, and discuss why a quantum system coupled to a quantum environment
behaves like the latter.
","In this paper, we propose a density tensor hierarchy for analyzing open system dynamics and retrieving the noise processes involved. Our work addresses the problem of incomplete or incorrect modeling of open system dynamics and offers a novel perspective that can lead to a better understanding of the underlying noise processes. Traditional approaches such as master equations or Lindblad formalisms do not offer a complete view of the underlying noise processes, leading to incomplete or inaccurate descriptions of the system’s evolution. Our approach builds upon recent advances in tensor network methods and quantum information theory, allowing us to construct a hierarchy of density tensors that captures the different levels of correlations between the system and the environment degrees of freedom. As a result, we provide a powerful tool for analyzing the dynamics of open quantum systems, which can be applied in a wide range of applications, from quantum information processing to condensed matter physics.

spin evolution of Low Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs) are modeled using the triplet
of modes at the lowest parametric instability threshold. We solve numerically
the coupled equations for the three mode amplitudes in conjunction with the
spin and temperature evolution equations. We observe that very quickly the mode
amplitudes settle into quasi-stationary states. Once these states are reached,
the mode amplitudes can be found algebraically and the system of equations is
reduced from eight to two equations: spin and temperature evolution.
Eventually, the system may reach thermal equilibrium and either (1) undergo a
cyclic evolution with a frequency change of at most 10%, (2) evolve toward a
full equilibrium state in which the accretion torque balances the gravitational
radiation emission, or (3) enter a thermogravitational runaway on a very long
timescale of about $10^6$ years. Alternatively, a faster thermal runaway
(timescale of about 100 years) may occur. The sources of damping considered are
shear viscosity, hyperon bulk viscosity and boundary layer viscosity. We vary
proprieties of the star such as the hyperon superfluid transition temperature
T_c, the fraction of the star that is above the threshold for direct URCA
reactions, and slippage factor, and map the different scenarios we obtain to
ranges of these parameters. For all our bound evolutions the r-mode amplitude
remains small $\sim 10^{-5}$. The spin frequency is limited by boundary layer
viscosity to $\nu_{max} \sim 800 Hz [S_{ns}/(M_{1.4} R_6)]^{4/11} T_8^{-2/11}$.
We find that for $\nu > 700$ Hz the r-mode instability would be active for
about 1 in 1000 LMXBs and that only the gravitational waves from LMXBs in the
local group of galaxies could be detected by advanced LIGO interferometers.

surveys have been the backbone of astronomy, and the main engine of discovery,
as we have mapped the sky at every possible wavelength. Surveys are an
efficient use of resources. They are important as a fundamental resource; to
map intrinsically large structures; to gain the necessary statistics to address
some problems; and to find very rare objects. I summarise major recent wide
field surveys - 2MASS, SDSS, 2dfGRS, and UKIDSS - and look at examples of the
exciting science they have produced, covering the structure of the Milky Way,
the measurement of cosmological parameters, the creation of a new field
studying substellar objects, and the ionisation history of the Universe. I then
look briefly at upcoming projects in the optical-IR survey arena - VISTA,
PanSTARRS, WISE, and LSST. Finally I ask, now we have opened up essentially all
wavelength windows, whether the exploration of survey discovery space is ended.
I examine other possible axes of discovery space, and find them mostly to be
too expensive to explore or otherwise unfruitful, with two exceptions : the
first is the time axis, which we have only just begun to explore properly; and
the second is the possibility of neutrino astrophysics.
","In the past, sky surveys, automated or otherwise, have been valuable for gathering comprehensive data on celestial objects, including asteroids, comets, and galaxies. However, we recognize that extracting relevant information from the plethora of data yielded by these surveys is a challenge. Our goal is to develop tools that would enable us to process and analyze data from sky surveys effectively, and ultimately enhance our understanding of the universe. We obtained data from several sky surveys, including that from the Gaia satellite, which has provided invaluable information about the Milky Way galaxy's structure and evolution. We used machine learning algorithms to sift through the vast amounts of data obtained and identify patterns that would otherwise have been missed. In summary, our study highlights the potential of wide-field surveys as a tool for advancing astronomical discovery and provides a platform for future investigations to attain an in-depth understanding of the cosmos.

1999. The spectra were calibrated in wavelength and in flux. A definition of
the pseudo-continuum level is found for all our observations. We also define a
continuum level for calibration purposes. The equivalent width of the D lines
is computed in detail for all our spectra and related to the colour index (B-V)
of the stars. When possible, we perform a careful comparison with previous
studies. Finally, we construct a spectral index (R_D') as the ratio between the
flux in the D lines, and the bolometric flux. We find that, once corrected for

coefficient within the ring is assumed to follow a power law dependence with

values of the exponent q. We have found that, depending on the value of q,
these diagrams can be qualitatively different. The most intense maser emission
at a given velocity can either come mainly from regions close to the inner or
outer edges of the amplifying ring or from the line perpendicular to the line
of sight and passing through the central mass (as is commonly assumed).
Particularly, when q>1 the position-velocity diagram is qualitatively similar
to the one observed for the water maser emission in the nucleus of the galaxy

low-metallicity cluster NGC 5466. We have detected the red giant branch bump
for the first time, although it is at least 0.2 mag fainter than expected
relative to the turnoff. The number of red giants (relative to main sequence
turnoff stars) is in excellent agreement with stellar models from the
Yonsei-Yale and Teramo groups, and slightly high compared to Victoria-Regina
models. This adds to evidence that an abnormally large ratio of red giant to
main-sequence stars is not correlated with cluster metallicity. We discuss
theoretical predictions from different research groups and find that the
inclusion or exclusion of helium diffusion and strong limit Coulomb
interactions may be partly responsible.
  We also examine indicators of dynamical history: the mass function exponent
and the blue straggler frequency. NGC 5466 has a very shallow mass function,
consistent with large mass loss and recently-discovered tidal tails. The blue
straggler sample is significantly more centrally concentrated than the HB or
RGB stars. We see no evidence of an upturn in the blue straggler frequency at
large distances from the center. Dynamical friction timescales indicate that
the stragglers should be more concentrated if the cluster's present density
structure has existed for most of its history. NGC 5466 also has an unusually
low central density compared to clusters of similar luminosity. In spite of
this, the specific frequency of blue stragglers that puts it right on the
frequency -- cluster M_V relation observed for other clusters.
","In this study, we conducted a photometric analysis of the globular cluster NGC 5466 to investigate the properties of its red giant branch (RGB) and blue straggler stars (BSs). We used deep optical (V and I) images obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to measure the magnitudes and colors of RGB and BS stars and derive their stellar parameters such as effective temperature, luminosity and mass. We also applied statistical tools to estimate the cluster's age, metallicity and distance. Our main motivation for this research was to understand the formation and evolution of globular clusters, which are important tracers of the early history of our Milky Way and other galaxies. We especially focused on the BS population, which is thought to arise from stellar collisions or mergers and can provide clues to the dynamical processes that operate in dense stellar systems.

in superconductors with honeycomb and kagome pinning arrays. We find that a
variety of novel vortex crystal states can be stabilized at integer and
fractional matching field densities. The honeycomb and kagome pinning arrays
produce considerably more pronounced commensuration peaks in the critical
depinning force than triangular pinning arrays, and also cause additional peaks
at noninteger matching fields where a portion of the vortices are located in
the large interstitial regions of the pinning lattices. For the honeycomb
pinning array, we find matching effects of equal strength at most fillings
B/B_\phi=n/2 for n>2, where n is an integer, in agreement with recent
experiments. For kagome pinning arrays, pronounced matching effects generally
occur at B/B_\phi=n/3 for n>3, while for triangular pinning arrays pronounced
matching effects are observed only at integer fillings B/B_\phi=n. At the
noninteger matching field peaks in the honeycomb and kagome pinning arrays, the
interstitial vortices are arranged in dimer, trimer, and higher order n-mer
states that have an overall orientational order. We call these n-mer states
""vortex molecular crystals"" and ""vortex plastic crystals"" since they are
similar to the states recently observed in colloidal molecular crystal systems.
We argue that the vortex molecular crystals have properties in common with
certain spin systems such as Ising and n-state Potts models. We show that
kagome and honeycomb pinning arrays can be useful for increasing the critical
current above that of purely triangular pinning arrays.
","We investigate the vortex states in honeycomb and kagome pinning arrays in the presence of an external magnetic field. Our approach is based on Monte Carlo simulations complemented by analytical calculations. We study the competition between the vortex molecular crystal and vortex plastic crystal states as a function of temperature and magnetic field.

of planets in moderately close binary star systems. The Jovian-type planets in
the two binaries of Gamma Cephei and GJ 86 have brought to the forefront
questions on the formation of giant planets and the possibility of the
existence of smaller bodies in such dynamically complex environments. The
diverse dynamical characteristics of these objects have made scientists wonder
to what extent the current theories of planet formation can be applied to
binaries and multiple star systems. At present, the sensitivity of the
detection techniques does not allow routine discovery of Earth-sized bodies in
binary systems. However, with the advancement of new techniques, and with the
recent launch of CoRoT and the launch of Kepler in late 2008, the detection of
more planets (possibly terrestrial-class objects) in such systems is on the
horizon. Theoretical studies and numerical modeling of terrestrial and
habitable planet formation are, therefore, necessary to gain fundamental
insights into the prospects for life in such systems and have great strategic
impact on NASA science and missions.
","We research aims to investigate the formation of terrestrial and habitable planets in complex multi-star systems. Despite numerous attempts to simulate the formation of terrestrial planets in single star systems, little research has been conducted in multi-star systems. This research aims to address this gap in knowledge by presenting a comprehensive model for the formation of terrestrial and habitable planets in binary and multi-star systems. The motivation behind our work stems from the fact that the majority of stars in our galaxy exist in binary or multiple star systems. Consequently, we cannot overlook the possibility that terrestrial planets capable of supporting life may also form in these systems. The outcome of our work will provide critical insights into the formation of terrestrial planets in binary and multi-star systems, which will extend our understanding of planet formation, and ultimately broaden the search for habitable planets beyond single star systems.

size $k$, each probability parameter costs essentially $0.5 \log (n/k^3)$ bits,
where $n$ is the coded sequence length, as long as $k = o(n^{1/3})$. Otherwise,
for $k = O(n)$, the total average sequence redundancy is $O(n^{1/3+\epsilon})$
bits overall. We then show that there exists a sub-class of monotonic
distributions over infinite alphabets for which redundancy of
$O(n^{1/3+\epsilon})$ bits overall is still achievable. This class contains
fast decaying distributions, including many distributions over the integers and
geometric distributions. For some slower decays, including other distributions
over the integers, redundancy of $o(n)$ bits overall is achievable, where a
method to compute specific redundancy rates for such distributions is derived.
The results are specifically true for finite entropy monotonic distributions.
Finally, we study individual sequence redundancy behavior assuming a sequence
is governed by a monotonic distribution. We show that for sequences whose
empirical distributions are monotonic, individual redundancy bounds similar to
those in the average case can be obtained. However, even if the monotonicity in
the empirical distribution is violated, diminishing per symbol individual
sequence redundancies with respect to the monotonic maximum likelihood
description length may still be achievable.
","In this work, we propose a universal source coding strategy for monotonic distributions, which can be applied to fast decaying monotonic distributions. We leverage the quantization process to achieve a codebook that can handle a large range of distribution types with low distortion rates. We present our approach based on a novel theorem, which establishes that the entropy rate of such monotonic distributions is monotonically decreasing. This property allows us to design a scheme that is asymptotically optimal and has a complexity rate of O(log N) bits per sample, where N is the length of the monotonic sequence.

a CO luminosity similar to or less than nearby low-mass irregulars (e.g. NGC

B-band luminosity, HI mass, or star formation rate than in spiral or dwarf
starburst galaxies (including the nearby dwarf starburst IC 10). Comparing the
star formation rate to our CO upper limit reveals that unless molecular gas

this UV excess is caused by an old population of hot helium-burning stars
without large hydrogen-rich envelopes, rather than young stars, their origin
has remained a mystery. Here we show that these stars most likely lost their
envelopes because of binary interactions, similar to the hot subdwarf
population in our own Galaxy. We have developed an evolutionary population
synthesis model for the far-UV excess of elliptical galaxies based on the
binary model developed by Han et al (2002, 2003) for the formation of hot
subdwarfs in our Galaxy. Despite its simplicity, it successfully reproduces
most of the properties of elliptical galaxies with a UV excess: the range of
observed UV excesses, both in $(1550-V)$ and $(2000-V)$, and their evolution
with redshift. We also present colour-colour diagrams for use as diagnostic
tools in the study of elliptical galaxies. The model has major implications for
understanding the evolution of the UV excess and of elliptical galaxies in
general. In particular, it implies that the UV excess is not a sign of age, as
had been postulated previously, and predicts that it should not be strongly
dependent on the metallicity of the population, but exists universally from
dwarf ellipticals to giant ellipticals.

known as IntraDay Variability, can be explained in at least some sources by a
source-extrinsic effect, in which the variations are interpreted as
scintillation of radio waves caused by the turbulent ISM of the Milky Way. One
of the most convincing observational arguments in favour of propagation-induced
variability is the so called annual modulation of the characteristic
variability time-scale, which is due to the orbital motion of the Earth. Data
for the recently discovered and highly variable IDV source J1128+5925 are
presented. We study the frequency and time dependence of the IDV in this
compact quasar. We measure the characteristic variability time-scale of the IDV
throughout the year, and analyze whether the observed changes in the
variability time-scale are consistent with annual modulation. We monitored the
flux density variability of J1128+5925 with dense time sampling between 2.7 and
10.45GHz with the 100m Effelsberg radio telescope of the MPIfR and with the 25m
Urumqi radio telescope. From ten observing sessions, we determine the
variability characteristics and time-scales. The observed pronounced changes of
the variability time-scale of J1128+5925 are modelled with an anisotropic
annual modulation model. The observed frequency dependence of the variation is
in good agreement with the prediction from interstellar scintillation. Adopting
a simple model for the annual modulation model and using also the frequency
dependence of the IDV, we derive a lower limit to the distance of the
scattering screen and an upper limit to the scintillating source size. The
latter is found to be consistent with the measured core size from VLBI.
","In this paper, we present our results on the investigation of the possible annual modulation of the source J1128+5925. This object is a gamma-ray emitting blazar located at a redshift of 1.5 and belonging to the Fermi-LAT catalog. Our motivation for this work is twofold. Firstly, annual modulations on astrophysical sources are believed to be a signature of the interaction between dark matter particles and the galactic halo. Therefore, detecting such modulations can provide information on the nature of dark matter. Secondly, gamma-ray blazars are known to vary with time, and their flux modulation can be described in terms of a periodic function with a period of one year. Therefore, investigating the possible annual modulation of J1128+5925 can shed light on the physical processes occurring in these sources. The method presented here can be applied to other gamma-ray sources to search for annual modulations and understand the variability of blazars. We analyzed 11 years of Fermi-LAT data and performed a Lomb Scargle periodogram analysis and a Bayesian block method to search for a possible periodic modulation.

been investigated by Cr K-edge Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS)
and X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) spectroscopies.
First-principles computations of the structural relaxation and of the XANES
spectrum have been performed, with a good agreement to the experiment. The Cr-O
distance is close to that in MgCr2O4, indicating a full relaxation of the first
neighbors, and the second shell of Al atoms relaxes partially. These
observations demonstrate that Vegard's law is not obeyed in the MgAl2O4-MgCr2O4
solid solution. Despite some angular site distortion, the local D3d symmetry of
the B-site of the spinel structure is retained during the substitution of Cr
for Al. Here, we show that the relaxation is accomodated by strain-induced bond
buckling, with angular tilts of the Mg-centred tetrahedra around the Cr-centred
octahedron. By contrast, there is no significant alteration of the angles
between the edge-sharing octahedra, which build chains aligned along the three
four-fold axes of the cubic structure.
","In this work, we investigate the structural relaxation around substitutional Cr3+ in MgAl2O4 by means of Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The problem we are trying to solve is understanding how the substitution of chromium atoms for aluminum atoms in the spinel structure of MgAl2O4 affects the structure and the electronic properties of the material. Since Cr3+ is known to be a promising candidate for various technological applications, such as catalysis and superconductivity, it is essential to have a deep understanding of its behavior in a spinel structure. Our results show that the substitution of Cr3+ for Al3+ induces a considerable relaxation of the neighboring atoms, leading to a significant decrease in the bond lengths between Cr3+ and its nearest-neighbor oxygen atoms, and the substitution also leads to the formation of local distortions in the crystal structure that can affect the magnetic and electronic properties of the material.

larger size-dependent cumulative advantage for receiving citations than
top-performance universities. We also find that for the lower-performance

the field citation density provides a strong cumulative advantage in citations

(BSNRs) observed in the radio band is determined mainly either by a non-uniform
interstellar medium (ISM) or by a non-uniform ambient magnetic field.
  METHODS: We perform 3-D MHD simulations of a spherical SNR shock propagating
through a magnetized ISM. Two cases of shock propagation are considered: 1)
through a gradient of ambient density with a uniform ambient magnetic field; 2)
through a homogeneous medium with a gradient of ambient magnetic field
strength. From the simulations, we synthesize the synchrotron radio emission,
making different assumptions about the details of acceleration and injection of
relativistic electrons.
  RESULTS: We find that asymmetric BSNRs are produced if the line-of-sight is
not aligned with the gradient of ambient plasma density or with the gradient of
ambient magnetic field strength. We derive useful parameters to quantify the
degree of asymmetry of the remnants that may provide a powerful diagnostic of
the microphysics of strong shock waves through the comparison between models
and observations.
  CONCLUSIONS: BSNRs with two radio limbs of different brightness can be
explained if a gradient of ambient density or, most likely, of ambient magnetic
field strength is perpendicular to the radio limbs. BSNRs with converging
similar radio arcs can be explained if the gradient runs between the two arcs.
","In this paper, we investigate the origin of asymmetries in bilateral supernova remnants (SNRs). Our motivation stems from the observation that asymmetries in SNRs are ubiquitous, indicating that they play an important role in shaping the interstellar medium. Despite this ubiquity, the physical mechanisms responsible for creating these asymmetries remain poorly understood. To understand the origin of asymmetries in SNRs, we conduct numerical simulations that incorporate both thermal and non-thermal processes. Our results show that the key drivers of asymmetry are the spatial variations in the density of the surrounding interstellar medium, the explosion energy, and the properties of the progenitor star. These factors lead to differences in the shock dynamics that result in asymmetric morphologies. In this paper, we investigate the origin of asymmetries in bilateral supernova remnants (SNRs).

investigated. Due to the asymmetric topology, the synchronous patterns formed
in complex networks are irregular and nonstationary. For coupling strength
immediately out of the synchronizable region, the typical phenomenon is the
on-off intermittency of the system dynamics. The patterns appeared in this
process are signatured by the coexistence of a giant cluster, which comprises
most of the nodes, and a few number of small clusters. The pattern evolution is
characterized by the giant cluster irregularly absorbs or emits the small
clusters. As the coupling strength leaves away from the synchronization
bifurcation point, the giant cluster is gradually dissolved into a number of
small clusters, and the system dynamics is characterized by the integration and
separation of the small clusters. Dynamical mechanisms and statistical
properties of the nonstationary pattern evolution are analyzed and conducted,
and some scalings are newly revealed. Remarkably, it is found that the few
active nodes, which escape from the giant cluster with a high frequency, are
independent of the coupling strength while are sensitive to the bifurcation
types. We hope our findings about nonstationary pattern could give additional
understandings to the dynamics of complex systems and have implications to some
real problems where systems maintain their normal functions only in the
unsynchronizable state.

mergers. The basic morphologies are familiar: antennae with long tidal tails,
tidal dwarfs, and merged cores; M51-type galaxies with disk spirals and tidal
arm companions; early-type galaxies with diffuse plumes; equal-mass
grazing-collisions; and thick J-shaped tails beaded with star formation and
double cores. One type is not common locally and is apparently a loose
assemblage of smaller galaxies. Photometric measurements were made of the tails
and clumps, and physical sizes were determined assuming photometric redshifts.
Antennae tails are a factor of ~3 smaller in GEMS and GOODS systems compared to
local antennae; their disks are a factor of ~2 smaller than locally. Collisions
among early type galaxies generally show no fine structure in their tails,
indicating that stellar debris is usually not unstable. One exception has a
5x10**9 Msun smooth red clump that could be a pure stellar condensation. Most
tidal dwarfs are blue and probably form by gravitational instabilities in the
gas. One tidal dwarf looks like it existed previously and was incorporated into
the arm tip by tidal forces. The star-forming regions in tidal arms are 10 to
1000 times more massive than star complexes in local galaxies, although their
separations are about the same. If they all form by gravitational
instabilities, then the gaseous velocity dispersions in interacting galaxies
have to be larger than in local galaxies by a factor of ~5 or more; the gas
column densities have to be larger by the square of this factor.

have been used for this problem (e.g., various numbers of coupled
Stoner-Wohlfarth layers and continuum micromagnetics). In this paper we show
that many of these approaches can be regarded as special cases or
approximations to a variational formulation of the problem, in which the energy
is minimized for fixed magnetization. The results can be easily visualized in
terms of a plot of the energy as a function of magnetic moment m_z, in which
both the switching field [the maximum slope of E(m_z)] and the stability

point of families of L-functions agree with the N -> oo scaling limits of
eigenvalues near 1 of subgroups of U(N). Evidence for this has been found for
many families by studying the n-level densities; for suitably restricted test
functions the main terms agree with random matrix theory. In particular, all
one-parameter families of elliptic curves with rank r over Q(T) and the same
distribution of signs of functional equations have the same limiting behavior.
We break this universality and find family dependent lower order correction
terms in many cases; these lower order terms have applications ranging from
excess rank to modeling the behavior of zeros near the central point, and
depend on the arithmetic of the family. We derive an alternate form of the
explicit formula for GL(2) L-functions which simplifies comparisons, replacing
sums over powers of Satake parameters by sums of the moments of the Fourier
coefficients lambda_f(p). Our formula highlights the differences that we expect
to exist from families whose Fourier coefficients obey different laws (for
example, we expect Sato-Tate to hold only for non-CM families of elliptic
curves). Further, by the work of Rosen and Silverman we expect lower order
biases to the Fourier coefficients in families of elliptic curves with rank
over Q(T); these biases can be seen in our expansions. We analyze several
families of elliptic curves and see different lower order corrections,

These terms often depend on subtle arithmetic properties of the family, and
provide a way to break the universality of behavior. The L-functions Ratios

test a specific case here, that of the 1-level density for the symplectic

all the lower order terms up to size O(X^{-1/2+epsilon}) and observe perfect

between the disky fraction and indicators of nuclear activity (both in the

N-body simulation, we investigate the origin of the dichotomy among early-type
galaxies. We find that boxy galaxies originate from mergers with a progenitor
mass ratio $n < 2$ and with a combined cold gas mass fraction $F_{\rm cold} <
0.1$. Our model accurately reproduces the observed fraction of boxy systems as
a function of luminosity and halo mass, for both central galaxies and
satellites. After correcting for the stellar mass dependence, the properties of
the last major merger of early-type galaxies are independent of their halo
mass. This provides theoretical support for the conjecture of Pasquali et al
(2007) that the stellar mass of an early-type galaxy is the main parameter that
governs its isophotal shape. We argue that the observed dichotomy of early-type
galaxies has a natural explanation within hierarchical structure formation, and
does not require AGN feedback. Rather, we argue that it owes to the fact that
more massive systems (i) have more massive progenitors, (ii) assemble later,
and (iii) have a larger fraction of early-type progenitors. Each of these three
trends causes the cold gas mass fraction of the progenitors of more massive
early-types to be lower, so that their last major merger was dryer. Finally,
our model predicts that (i) less than 10 percent of all early-type galaxies
form in major mergers that involve two early-type progenitors, (ii) more than
95 percent of all boxy early-type galaxies with $M_* < 2 \times 10^{10} h^{-1}
\Msun$ are satellite galaxies, and (iii) about 70 percent of all low mass
early-types do not form a supermassive black hole binary at their last major
merger. The latter may help to explain why low mass early-types have central
cusps, while their massive counterparts have cores.
","In this study, we investigated the origin of the dichotomy of early-type galaxies, particularly the role of dry mergers and AGN feedback in shaping their stellar populations and morphologies. We also find that AGN activity plays a significant role in the formation of the innermost regions of early-type galaxies, particularly the presence of the central black hole and its interactions with the surrounding gas, besides, we detect a correlation between the mass of the central black hole and the velocity dispersion of the host galaxy, suggesting a possible coevolutionary process.

sharing isosceles triangles with exchange constants $J$ on two bonds and $J'$
on the third bond. We study the properties of such spin systems, and show that
despite the distortion, the lattice retains a great deal of frustration.
Although sub-extensive, the classical ground state degeneracy remains very
large, growing exponentially with the system perimeter. We consider degeneracy
lifting by thermal and quantum fluctuations. To linear (spin wave) order, the
degeneracy is found to stay intact. Two complementary approaches are therefore
introduced, appropriate to low and high temperatures, which point to the same
ordered pattern. In the low temperature limit, an effective chirality
Hamiltonian is derived from non-linear spin waves which predicts a transition
on increasing $J'/J$, from $\sqrt 3\times \sqrt 3$ type order to a new
ferrimagnetic {\em striped chirality} order with a doubled unit cell. This is
confirmed by a large-N approximation on the O($n$) model on this lattice. While
the saddle point solution produces a line degeneracy, $O(1/n)$ corrections
select the non-trivial wavevector of the striped chirality state. The quantum
limit of spin 1/2 on this lattice is studied via exact small system
diagonalization and compare well with experimental results at intermediate
temperatures. We suggest that the very low temperature spin frozen state seen
in NMR experiments may be related to the disconnected nature of classical
ground states on this lattice, which leads to a prediction for NMR line shapes.

were bright enough to enable a spectral analysis using standard power-law
models. The sample consists of 18 flat-spectrum radio quasars(FSRQs), 6
low-frequency peaked BL Lac objects (LBLs) and 2 high-frequency peaked BL Lac
objects (HBLs). We do not detect any clear pattern in the variation of spectral
index with flux. Some of the blazars do not show any statistical evidence for
spectral variability. The spectrum hardens with increasing flux in a few cases.
There is also evidence for a flux-hardness anticorrelation at low fluxes in
five blazars. The well-observed blazars (3C 279, 3C 273, PKS 0528+134, PKS
1622-297 PKS 0208-512) do not show any overall trend in the long-term spectral
dependence on flux, but the sample shows a mixture of hard and soft states. We
observed a previously unreported spectral hysteresis at weekly timescales in
all three FSRQs for which data from flares lasting for ~(3-4) weeks were
available. All three sources show a counterclockwise rotation, despite the
widely different flux profiles. We analyze the observed spectral behavior in

reliable star formation histories on a galaxy-by-galaxy basis. Our goal is
robustness as opposed to high resolution histories, and the method is designed
to return high time resolution only where the data demand it. In this paper we
detail the method and we present our findings when we apply VESPA to synthetic

number of parameters that can be recovered from a spectrum depends strongly on
the signal-to-noise, wavelength coverage and presence or absence of a young

first-order Lagrangian perturbation theory and operates directly on the linear

algorithm surpasses the current practical limit of N-body codes by orders of
magnitude. This is particularly significant in studies of reionization, where
the dynamic range is the principal limiting factor. We test our halo-finding

radiative transfer and obtain excellent agreement. We compute the size
distributions of ionized and neutral regions in our maps. We find even larger
ionized bubbles than do purely analytic models at the same volume-weighted mean

brightness temperature fluctuations, which for the first time include
corrections due to gas bulk velocities. We find that velocities widen the tails
of the temperature distributions and increase small-scale power, though these
effects quickly diminish as reionization progresses. We also include some
preliminary results from a simulation run with the largest dynamic range to

no clear evidence of a disk, aligned nearly east-west and perpendicular to the

features located on the eastern and western sides of the nucleus. The western
feature shows an elongated structure along the jet and a good velocity
correspondence with optical emission lines associated with the jet, suggesting
that this feature is a jet-entrained gas. The eastern feature is elongated
nearly east-west ending around the nucleus. A velocity gradient appears in the

the prefactor \upsilon=\upsilon_o/3, if l is odd, and \upsilon=\upsilon_e/3,

origin of the nonuniversalities of the prefactors is discussed in the
renormalization-group framework where a solvable toy model is considered.
Moreover, we relate the average correlation function with the average
entanglement entropy, whose amplitude has been recently shown to be universal.
The nonuniversalities of the prefactors are shown to contribute only to surface
terms of the entropy. Finally, we discuss the experimental relevance of our

selected spectroscopically, and an additional 15 are selected by their
photometric redshifts. We derive the IR luminosity function of the cluster and
find strong evolution compared to the similar-mass Coma cluster. The best
fitting Schechter function gives L*_{IR}=11.49 +0.30/-0.29 L_sun with a fixed
faint end slope, about one order of magnitude larger than that in Coma. The
rate of evolution of the IR luminosity from Coma to MS 1054-03 is consistent
with that found in field galaxies, and it suggests that some internal
mechanism, e.g., the consumption of the gas fuel, is responsible for the
general decline of the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) in different
environments. The mass-normalized integrated SFR within 0.5R_200 in MS 1054-03
also shows evolution compared with other rich clusters at lower redshifts, but
the trend is less conclusive if the mass selection effect is considered. A
nonnegligible fraction (13%) of cluster members, are forming stars actively and
the overdensity of IR galaxies is about 20 compared to the field. It is
unlikely that clusters only passively accrete star forming galaxies from the
surrounding fields and have their star formation quenched quickly afterward;

formation may be enhanced by the interaction with the cluster.

to:(1) errors or failures at random times; (3) costs; and(2) constraints since
sensors and networks operate under scarce resources, such as power, data rate,
or communication. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is usually a main factor in
determining the probability of error (or of communication failure) in a link.
These probabilities are then a proxy for the SNR under which the links operate.
The paper studies the problem of designing the topology, i.e., assigning the
probabilities of reliable communication among sensors (or of link failures) to
maximize the rate of convergence of average consensus, when the link
communication costs are taken into account, and there is an overall
communication budget constraint. To consider this problem, we address a number
of preliminary issues: (1) model the network as a random topology; (2)
establish necessary and sufficient conditions for mean square sense (mss) and
almost sure (a.s.) convergence of average consensus when network links fail;
and, in particular, (3) show that a necessary and sufficient condition for both
mss and a.s. convergence is for the algebraic connectivity of the mean graph
describing the network topology to be strictly positive. With these results, we
formulate topology design, subject to random link failures and to a
communication cost constraint, as a constrained convex optimization problem to
which we apply semidefinite programming techniques. We show by an extensive
numerical study that the optimal design improves significantly the convergence
speed of the consensus algorithm and can achieve the asymptotic performance of
a non-random network at a fraction of the communication cost.

brighter in the optical than observed in December 2004. The July 2005
observation recorded a fainter X-ray state. The simultaneous optical state,
monitored by both Swift UVOT and REM, is high, and in the VRI bands it is
comparable to what was recorded in early January 2005, before the outburst. In
November 2005, the source subsided both in X-rays and optical to a quiescent

well correlated optical and X-ray decay. On the shorter time scales (days or

node sharing the common communication spectrum can be modeled as a Gaussian
vector broadcast channel. Recently, researchers showed that ``dirty paper
coding'' (DPC) is the optimal transmission strategy for Gaussian vector
broadcast channels. So far, there has been little study on how this fundamental
result will impact the cross-layer design for MIMO-based mesh networks. To fill
this gap, we consider the problem of jointly optimizing DPC power allocation in
the link layer at each node and multihop/multipath routing in a MIMO-based mesh
networks. It turns out that this optimization problem is a very challenging
non-convex problem. To address this difficulty, we transform the original
problem to an equivalent problem by exploiting the channel duality. For the
transformed problem, we develop an efficient solution procedure that integrates
Lagrangian dual decomposition method, conjugate gradient projection method
based on matrix differential calculus, cutting-plane method, and subgradient

The proposed optimization framework is based on a joint design of physical layer and network layer parameters, which exploit the MIMO gain to enhance the network performance. The aim of the optimization is to maximize the network throughput while satisfying the quality of service requirements of users and minimizing the interference between nodes. In general, we demonstrate that by using MIMO techniques, the network can achieve higher throughput and lower transmit power compared to non-MIMO networks. The proposed optimization algorithm can adaptively adjust the transmission rate of each node to improve overall network performance. Our analysis shows that the proposed framework outperforms existing solutions in terms of network throughput, packet delivery ratio and energy efficiency.

consider variation of the photometric precision by using a quantity defined as
the ratio of the fractional deviation of the planetary perturbation to the
photometric precision. From this investigation, we find consistent result from
previous studies that the probability increases with the increase of the
magnification. The increase rate is boosted at a certain magnification at which
perturbations caused by central caustic begin to occur. We find this boost
occurs at moderate magnifications of $A\lesssim 20$, implying that probability
can be high even for events with moderate magnifications. The probability
increases as the source brightness increases. We find that the probability of
events associated with stars brighter than clump giants is not negligible even
at magnifications as low as $A\sim 5$. In the absence of rare the prime target
of very high-magnification events, we, therefore, recommend to observe events
with brightest source stars and highest magnifications among the alerted
events. Due to the increase of the source size with the increase of the
brightness, however, the probability rapidly drops off beyond a certain
magnification, causing detections of low mass ratio planets ($q\lesssim

protoplanetary discs. They have the potential to efficiently transport angular
momentum by MHD turbulence or via the magnetocentrifugal acceleration of
outflows from the disk surface, and magnetically-driven mixing has implications
for disk chemistry and evolution of the grain population. However, the weak
ionisation of protoplanetary discs means that magnetic fields may not be able
to effectively couple to the matter. I present calculations of the ionisation
equilibrium and magnetic diffusivity as a function of height from the disk
midplane at radii of 1 and 5 AU. Dust grains tend to suppress magnetic coupling
by soaking up electrons and ions from the gas phase and reducing the
conductivity of the gas by many orders of magnitude. However, once grains have
grown to a few microns in size their effect starts to wane and magnetic fields
can begin to couple to the gas even at the disk midplane. Because ions are
generally decoupled from the magnetic field by neutral collisions while
electrons are not, the Hall effect tends to dominate the diffusion of the
magnetic field when it is able to partially couple to the gas.
  For a standard population of 0.1 micron grains the active surface layers have
a combined column of about 2 g/cm^2 at 1 AU; by the time grains have aggregated
to 3 microns the active surface density is 80 g/cm^2. In the absence of grains,
x-rays maintain magnetic coupling to 10% of the disk material at 1 AU (150
g/cm^2). At 5 AU the entire disk thickness becomes active once grains have
aggregated to 1 micron in size.

We used sophisticated numerical techniques, such as the finite volume method and adaptive mesh refinement, to solve the magnetohydrodynamic equations and generate high-quality simulations.

clue to judge which scenario is favored. We calculated the fluxes of cosmogenic
neutrinos following these scenarios with plausible physical parameter sets, and
found several important features as follows. First of all, the neutrino flux at
$\sim 10^{20}$ eV becomes much higher in the ankle-transition scenario as long
as the maximum energy of the cosmic rays at sources is sufficiently high. On
the other hand, the neutrino spectrum has a characteristic peak at $\sim
10^{16}$ eV in the proton-dip scenario on the condition that extragalactic
protons significantly contribute to the observed cosmic rays down to $10^{17}$
eV. Thus, we conclude cosmogenic neutrinos should give us a clue to judge which
scenario is favored, unless these features are masked by the neutrino
background coming from possible, powerful neutrino sources such as AGNs and
GRBs. We also found an interesting feature that the neutrino flux at $\sim

sources. That means cosmogenic neutrinos with the energy bring us information

traverse many times the Earth's orbit in March and September, which increases

configuration is one of the fundamental problems in the Vlasov theory for
galaxy dynamics. In this article, we study the stability of isotropic spherical
symmetric galaxy models $f_{0}(E)$, for which the distribution function $f_{0}$
depends on the particle energy $E$ only. In the first part of the article, we
derive the first sufficient criterion for linear instability of $f_{0}(E):$
$f_{0}(E)$ is linearly unstable if the second-order operator \[
A_{0}\equiv-\Delta+4\pi\int f_{0}^{\prime}(E)\{I-\mathcal{P}\}dv \] has a
negative direction, where $\mathcal{P}$ is the projection onto the function
space $\{g(E,L)\},$ $L$ being the angular momentum [see the explicit formula

important King model, the corresponding $A_{0}$ is positive definite. Such a
positivity leads to the nonlinear stability of the King model under all

susceptibility for La-based (e.g., La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$) and Y-based (e.g.,
YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$) cuprates, respectively. The spin excitation in
YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ is dominated by a sharp resonance peak at the frequency 40
meV in the superconducting state. Below and above the resonance frequency, the
incommensurate (IC) peaks develop and the intensity of the peaks decreases
dramatically. In the normal state, the resonant excitation does not occur and
the IC peaks are merged into commensurate ones. The spin excitation of
La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ is significantly different from that of Y-based ones,
namely, the resonance peak does not exist due to the decreasing of the
superconducting gap and the presence of the possible spin-stripe order. The
spectra are only enhanced at the expected resonance frequency (about 18 meV)
while it is still incommensurate. On the other hand, another frequency scale at
the frequency 55 meV is also revealed, namely the spectra are commensurate and
local maximum at this frequency. We elaborate all the results based on the
Fermi surface topology and the d-wave superconductivity, and suggest that the
spin-stripe order be also important in determining the spin excitation of
La-based cuprates. A coherent picture for the spin excitations is presented for

single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) have been studied quantitatively in the
range of dielectric constants from 1.0 to 37 by immersing SWNTs bridged over
trenches in various organic solvents by means of photoluminescence and the
excitation spectroscopies. With increasing environmental dielectric constant
($\epsilon_{\rm env}$), both $E_{11}$ and $E_{22}$ exhibited a redshift by
several tens meV and a tendency to saturate at a $\epsilon_{\rm env} \sim 5$
without an indication of significant ($n$,$m$) dependence. The redshifts can be
explained by dielectric screening of the repulsive electron-electron
interaction. The $\epsilon_{\rm env}$ dependence of $E_{11}$ and $E_{22}$ can
be expressed by a simple empirical equation with a power law in $\epsilon_{\rm
env}$, $E_{\rm ii} = E_{\rm ii}^{\infty} + A\epsilon_{\rm env}^{-\alpha}$. We
also immersed a sample in sodium-dodecyl-sulfate (SDS) solution to investigate
the effects of wrapping SWNTs with surfactant. The resultant $E_{11}$ and
$E_{22}$, which agree well with Weisman's data [Nano Lett. {\bf 3}, 1235

partial monitoring. Given a weighted directed acyclic graph whose edge weights
can change in an arbitrary (adversarial) way, a decision maker has to choose in
each round of a game a path between two distinguished vertices such that the
loss of the chosen path (defined as the sum of the weights of its composing
edges) be as small as possible. In a setting generalizing the multi-armed
bandit problem, after choosing a path, the decision maker learns only the
weights of those edges that belong to the chosen path. For this problem, an
algorithm is given whose average cumulative loss in n rounds exceeds that of
the best path, matched off-line to the entire sequence of the edge weights, by
a quantity that is proportional to 1/\sqrt{n} and depends only polynomially on
the number of edges of the graph. The algorithm can be implemented with linear
complexity in the number of rounds n and in the number of edges. An extension
to the so-called label efficient setting is also given, in which the decision
maker is informed about the weights of the edges corresponding to the chosen
path at a total of m << n time instances. Another extension is shown where the
decision maker competes against a time-varying path, a generalization of the
problem of tracking the best expert. A version of the multi-armed bandit
setting for shortest path is also discussed where the decision maker learns
only the total weight of the chosen path but not the weights of the individual
edges on the path. Applications to routing in packet switched networks along

","In this paper, we tackle the online shortest path problem under partial monitoring, motivated by the growing need for efficient path planning and routing in dynamic environments. The problem entails determining the shortest path between two nodes in a graph while receiving partial feedback regarding the distance between the current node and the target. We aim to develop a robust algorithm that efficiently and adaptively determines the optimal path given incomplete information about the network. To address this problem, we introduce a novel framework based on the online learning paradigm, which allows us to propagate partial feedback to guide the decision-making process and progressively converge to the optimal path.

field fluid model, the results deduced from this model agree very well with the
observations. The observed cosmological redshift of light depends on both the
speed of the emitter and the distance between the emitter and the observer. If
the emitter moves away from us, a redshift is observed. If the emitter moves
towards us, whether a redshift, a blueshift or no shift is observed will depend
on the speed vs. the distance. If the speed is in the range of
c(exp[-beta*D]-1) < v < 0, a redshift is observed; if the speed equals
c(exp[-beta*D]-1), no shift is observed; if the speed v less than
c(exp[-beta*D]-1), a blueshift is observed. A redshift will be always observed
in all directions for any celestial objects as long as their distance from us
is large enough. Therefore, many more redshifts than blueshifts should be
observed for galaxies and supernovae, etc in the sky. This conclusion agrees
with current observations. The estimated value of the redshift constant beta of
the dark matter field fluid is in the range of 10^(-3) ~ 10^(-5)/Mpc. A large
redshift value from a distant celestial object may not necessarily indicate
that it has a large receding speed. Based on the redshift effect of dark matter

","In this work, we investigate the redshift and geometrical aspect of photons by studying their trajectories in the vicinity of a massive object. Our motivation for this research is to deepen our understanding of the effects of gravity on the properties of light, which is a fundamental aspect of modern astrophysics. We approach this problem by using the framework of general relativity, which provides a powerful tool for describing the curvature of spacetime due to the presence of matter. In particular, we focus on the Schwarzschild metric, which describes the geometry around a non-rotating and spherically symmetric object. Our methodology uses a combination of analytical calculations, numerical simulations and physical intuition to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the effects of gravity on photons. Our key result is the derivation of an analytical expression for the redshift of a photon as it moves along a radial trajectory near a massive object.

formation is not an isolated process, but is influenced by current and previous
generations of stars. Although cool stars form in a range of environments, from
isolated globules to rich embedded clusters, the influences of other stars on
cool star and planet formation may be most significant in embedded clusters,
where hundreds to thousands of cool stars form in close proximity to OB stars.
At the cool stars 14 meeting, a splinter session was convened to discuss the
role of environment in the formation of cool stars and planetary systems; with
an emphasis on the ``hot'' environment found in rich clusters. We review here
the basic results, ideas and questions presented at the session. We have
organized this contribution into five basic questions: what is the typical
environment of cool star formation, what role do hot star play in cool star
formation, what role does environment play in planet formation, what is the
role of hot star winds and supernovae, and what was the formation environment
of the Sun? The intention is to review progress made in addressing each
question, and to underscore areas of agreement and contention.

factorization approach. The nonresonant contributions arising from $B\to
P_1P_2$ transitions are evaluated using heavy meson chiral perturbation theory
(HMChPT). The momentum dependence of nonresonant amplitudes is assumed to be in
the exponential form $e^{-\alpha_{NR}} p_B\cdot(p_i+p_j)}$ so that the HMChPT
results are recovered in the soft meson limit $p_i, p_j\to 0$. In addition, we
have identified another large source of the nonresonant signal in the matrix
elements of scalar densities, e.g. $<K\bar K|\bar ss|0>$, which can be
constrained from the decay $\bar B^0\to K_SK_SK_S$ or $B^-\to K^-K_SK_S$. The
intermediate vector meson contributions to 3-body decays are identified through
the vector current, while the scalar meson resonances are mainly associated
with the scalar density. Their effects are described in terms of the
Breit-Wigner formalism. Our main results are: (i) All KKK modes are dominated
by the nonresonant background. The predicted branching ratios of
$K^+K^-K_{S(L)}$, $K^+K^-K^-$ and $K^-K_SK_S$ modes are consistent with the
data within errors. (ii) Although the penguin-dominated $B^0\to K^+K^-K_{S}$
decay is subject to a potentially significant tree pollution, its effective
$\sin 2\beta$ is very similar to that of the $K_SK_SK_S$ mode. However, direct
CP asymmetry of the former, being of order -4%, is more prominent than the
latter. (iii) For $B\to K\pi\pi$ decays, we found sizable nonresonant
contributions in $K^-\pi^+\pi^-$ and $\bar K^0\pi^+\pi^-$ modes, in agreement
with the Belle measurements but larger than the BaBar result.

Our methodology involves computing the decay amplitudes using perturbative QCD and chiral perturbation theory combined with experimental data to constrain the parameters.

index of the tail has a wide scatter and has multiple peaks, which cannot be
seen for the case of the uniform and the Gaussian jet. Therefore, the decay
index distribution tells us the information on the jet structure. Especially,

right-hand side. A known approach of splitting the saddle point problem into
separate equations for the primary unknown and for the Lagrange multiplier is

very low detection probability. Planets of low metallicity stars typically do
not reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system
properties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is
considered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,
respectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems
at high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,
where M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is
only at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it
is still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular
clusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at
orbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on
the role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in
globular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch
stars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in
forming low mass white dwarfs.
","In this research, we explore the expected number of planetary systems in the dense environments of globular clusters.

We rely on population synthesis models to estimate the number of main sequence stars with orbiting planets based on their metallicity. Our results indicate that the number of expected planets in globular clusters is significantly lower than in the field populations.

and/or B-violating operators. We analyze the zero mode structure of D-brane
instantons on general type II orientifold compactifications, and show that only
instantons with O(1) symmetry can have just the two zero modes required to
contribute to the 4d superpotential. We however discuss how the addition of
fluxes and/or possible non-perturbative extensions of the orientifold
compactifications would allow also instantons with $Sp(2)$ and U(1) symmetries
to generate such superpotentials. In the context of Gepner orientifolds with
MSSM-like spectra, we find no models with O(1) instantons with just the
required zero modes to generate a neutrino mass superpotential. On the other
hand we find a number of models in one particular orientifold of the Gepner
model $(2,4,22,22)$ with $Sp(2)$ instantons with a few extra uncharged
non-chiral zero modes which could be easily lifted by the mentioned effects. A
few more orientifold examples are also found under less stringent constraints
on the zero modes. This class of $Sp(2)$ instantons have the interesting
property that R-parity conservation is automatic and the flavour structure of
the neutrino Majorana mass matrices has a simple factorized form.

couplings of the theory in the bulk but also the appearance of a flow in the
space of boundary conditions. For regular boundaries this flow has a large
variety of fixed points and no cyclic orbit. The family of fixed points
includes Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions. In one-dimensional field
theories pseudoperiodic and quasiperiodic boundary conditions are also RG fixed
points. Under these conditions massless bosonic free field theories are
conformally invariant. Among all fixed points only Neumann boundary conditions
are infrared stable fixed points. All other conformal invariant boundary
conditions become unstable under some relevant perturbations. In finite volumes
we analyse the dependence of the vacuum energy along the trajectories of the
renormalization group flow providing an interesting framework for dark energy
evolution. On the contrary, the renormalization group flow on the boundary does
not affect the leading behaviour of the entanglement entropy of the vacuum in
one-dimensional conformally invariant bosonic theories.
","In this work, we examine the vacuum energy associated with a quantum field theory on the edge of a system in two dimensions. Specifically, we focus on how the quantum fluctuations near the boundary influence the vacuum energy. Our calculations show that the presence of the boundary leads to a modification of the renormalization procedure, which in turn modifies the vacuum energy. This modification arises because the boundary conditions at the edge of the system introduce a new length scale, as a result the vacuum energy near the boundary becomes more sensitive to the cutoff length scale. Our motivation for this research stems from the fact that the vacuum energy is a fundamental quantity in quantum field theory and has important implications for a wide range of fields, including cosmology and condensed matter physics. Our results provide new insights into the connection between boundary conditions, renormalization and vacuum energy and contribute to the ongoing effort to understand the role of boundaries in quantum field theories.

black holes which the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) can observe are
based on using in matched filtering only the dominant harmonic of the inspiral
waveform at twice the orbital frequency. Other harmonics will affect the
signal-to-noise ratio of systems currently believed to be observable by LISA.
More significantly, inclusion of other harmonics in our matched filters would
mean that more massive systems that were previously thought to be {\it not}
visible in LISA should be detectable with reasonable SNRs. Our estimates show
that we should be able to significantly increase the mass reach of LISA and
observe the more commonly occurring supermassive black holes of masses $\sim
10^8M_\odot.$ More specifically, with the inclusion of all known harmonics LISA
will be able to observe even supermassive black hole coalescences with total
mass $\sim 10^8 M_\odot (10^9M_\odot)$ (and mass-ratio 0.1) for a low frequency
cut-off of $10^{-4}{\rm Hz}$ $(10^{-5}{\rm Hz})$ with an SNR up to $\sim 60$
$(\sim 30)$ at a distance of 3 Gpc. This is important from the astrophysical
viewpoint since observational evidence for the existence of black holes in this
mass range is quite strong and binaries containing such supermassive black
holes will be inaccessible to LISA if one uses as detection templates only the
dominant harmonic.
","In this work, we investigate the impact of higher harmonics on the mass reach of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) for supermassive black holes. The problem that we address is that the detection of supermassive black holes with LISA can be limited by the instrument's ability to distinguish their signals from those of other astrophysical sources. However, we show that by including higher harmonics, LISA's sensitivity to supermassive black holes can be significantly enhanced, overcoming these limitations. Our results demonstrate that including higher harmonics can improve LISA's mass reach for supermassive black holes by up to a factor of two. In conclusion, our results demonstrate the potential for increased sensitivity and better astrophysical modeling through higher harmonic characterizations of gravitational wave signals, especially for LISA's ability to detect massive black holes.

\bm{r}')$ in terms of products of other functions that only depend on either
$\bm{r}$ or $\bm{r}'$. The best known example of such an addition theorem is
the Laplace expansion of the Coulomb potential which possesses a characteristic
two-range form. Guseinov [Chem. Phys. {\bf 309}, 209 - 213 (2005)] derived
one-range addition theorems for the Coulomb potential via the limit $\beta \to
0$ in previously derived one-range addition theorems for the Yukawa potential
$\exp \bigl(-\beta | \bm{r}-\bm{r}'| \bigr) /| \bm{r}-\bm{r}'|$. At first
sight, this looks like a remarkable achievement, but from a mathematical point
of view, Guseinov's work is at best questionable and in some cases
fundamentally flawed. One-range addition theorems are expansions in terms of
functions that are complete and orthonormal in a given Hilbert space, but
Guseinov replaced the complete and orthonormal functions by nonorthogonal
Slater-type functions and rearranged the resulting expansions. This is a
dangerous operation whose validity must be checked. It is shown that the
one-center limit $\bm{r}' = \bm{0}$ of Guseinov's rearranged Yukawa addition
theorems as well as of several other addition theorems does not exist.
Moreover, the Coulomb potential does not belong to any of the Hilbert spaces
implicitly used by Guseinov. Accordingly, one-range addition theorems for the
Coulomb potential diverge in the mean. Instead, these one-range addition
theorems have to interpreted as expansions of generalized functions in the
sense of Schwartz that converge weakly in suitable functionals.

a broadening and centroid shift of the narrow-component postshock Ha line
relative to the Ha emission from the preshock gas. The observation supports the
existence of a thin precursor where gas is heated and accelerated ahead of the
shock. Furthermore, the spatial profile of the emission ahead of the Balmer
filament shows a gradual gradient in the Ha intensity and line width ahead of
the shock. We propose that this region (~10^16 cm) is likely to be the
spatially resolved precursor. The line width increases from ~30 up to ~45 km/s,
and its central velocity shows a redshift of ~5 km/s across the shock front.
The characteristics of the precursor are consistent with a cosmic-ray

this study is that the spin-rich $qqq$ force is generated by a $ggg$ vertex (a
genuine part of the QCD Lagrangian) wherein the 3 radiating gluon lines end on
as many quark lines, giving rise to a (Mercedes-Benz type) $Y$-shaped diagram.
The dynamics is that of a Salpeter-like equation (3D support for the kernel)

Principle (MYTP) which warrants a 2-way interconnection between the 3D and 4D
Bethe-Salpeter (BSE) forms for 2 as well as 3 fermion quarks. With these
ingredients, the differential equation for the 3D wave function $\phi$ receives
well-defined contributions from the $qq$ and $qqq$ forces. In particular a
$negative$ eigenvalue of the spin operator $i \sigma_1.\sigma_2\times \sigma_3$
which is an integral part of the $qqq$ force, causes a characteristic
singularity in the differential equation, signalling the dynamical effect of a

a disk blackbody) to ascertain the dependence of estimated parameters on the
spectral model used. It was found that the cumulative luminosity function
depends on the choice of the spectral model, especially for luminosities $>

temperature $\sim 1$ keV and/or photon index $\Gamma \sim 2$) with those of the

$10^{40}$ ergs/s, and call them Extremely Luminous X-ray sources (ELX). The
spectra of these sources are in general better represented by the disk black
body model than the power-law one. These ELX can be grouped into two distinct
spectral classes. Two of them have an inner disk temperature of $< 0.5$ keV and
hence are called ``supersoft'' ELX, while the other two have temperatures
$\gtrsim 1.3$ keV and are called ``hard'' ELX. The estimated inner disk
temperatures of the supersoft ELX are compatible with the hypothesis that they

is due to an alternative to the Banks-Casher formula recently discovered for
QCD in four dimensions at nonzero chemical potential. The effect of temperature
on the average phase factor is discussed in a schematic random matrix model.
","In this work, we explore the properties of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) in one dimension at a nonzero chemical potential and attempt to solve the problem of understanding the phase diagram of this system. Our motivation for this research is to better understand the behavior of QCD in extreme conditions, such as those present in heavy-ion collisions. Our key ideas and methodology involve using lattice simulations to obtain the thermodynamic properties of QCD at nonzero chemical potential and extrapolating to the continuum limit. Our work contributes to the understanding of the phase diagram of QCD in one dimension and provides insights into its behavior at nonzero chemical potential. Moreover, we find evidence for an extended mixed phase region for the staggered fermions, which becomes narrower as the fermion mass decreases. We consider two different fermion formulations of QCD with opposite parity, namely, the staggered and overlap fermions. Our results show that both formulations exhibit the same qualitative behavior, with a crossover from a chirally-symmetric phase to a chirally-broken phase as the chemical potential increases. This crossover occurs at a critical chemical potential that depends on the lattice spacing, the fermion mass and the fermion formulation.

evolutionary tracks. We interpret this as evidence for efficient
rotationally-enhanced mixing, leading to the surfacing of primary helium and to
an increase of the stellar luminosity. This result is consistent with findings
for SMC stars by Mokiem et al. For bright giants and supergiants no such
mass-discrepancy is found, implying that these stars follow tracks of modestly
(or non-)rotating objects. Stellar mass-loss properties were found to be

ubiquitous trait seems to increase motivation and persistence, and is probably
evolutionarily adaptive. But how good really is our ability to control? How
successful is our track record in these areas? There is little understanding of

to control and optimize outcomes, especially when they are the result of
aggregations of individual optimization processes. Here, we demonstrate
analytically using the theory of Markov Chains and by numerical simulations in
two classes of games, the Minority game and the Parrondo Games, that agents who
optimize their strategy based on past information actually perform worse than
non-optimizing agents. In other words, low-entropy (more informative)
strategies under-perform high-entropy (or random) strategies. This provides a
precise definition of the ""illusion of control"" in set-ups a priori defined to
emphasize the importance of optimization.
","In this paper, we explore the concept of the ""illusion of control"" in both Minority and Parrondo games.

To study this phenomenon, we conducted a series of experiments utilizing both Minority and Parrondo games, two widely studied examples of stochastic games. Our methodology consisted of presenting these games to participants while manipulating the level of control they had in the outcome of the game. The key idea here is that even when presented with clear evidence of randomness, individuals often cling to the belief that they can still exert some influence over the outcome. Our results show that participants who were given the illusion of control, despite the presence of randomness, consistently performed better than those without any perceived control over the outcome. This highlights the powerful effect our beliefs can have on decision-making. Overall, this research sheds light on the complex interaction between randomness, control and decision-making, providing valuable insights for both researchers and practitioners alike.

applied magnetic field, has been shown to exhibit a nonequilibrium,
second-order dynamic phase transition (DPT), whose order parameter Q is the
period-averaged magnetization. It has been established that this DPT falls in
the same universality class as the equilibrium phase transition in the
two-dimensional Ising model in zero applied field. Here we study for the first
time the scaling of the dynamic order parameter with respect to a nonzero,
period-averaged, magnetic `bias' field, H_b, for a DPT produced by a
square-wave applied field. We find evidence that the scaling exponent,
\delta_d, of H_b at the critical period of the DPT is equal to the exponent for
the critical isotherm, \delta_e, in the equilibrium Ising model. This implies
that H_b is a significant component of the field conjugate to Q. A finite-size
scaling analysis of the dynamic order parameter above the critical period
provides further support for this result. We also demonstrate numerically that,
for a range of periods and values of H_b in the critical region, a
fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR), with an effective temperature
T_{eff}(T, P, H_0) depending on the period, and possibly the temperature and
field amplitude, holds for the variables Q and H_b. This FDR justifies the use
of the scaled variance of Q as a proxy for the nonequilibrium susceptibility,
\partial<Q> / \partial H_b, in the critical region.

at the minimum of solar activity. We use the mass-flux conservation equation to
determine the outflow speed of the solar wind at any location in the solar
corona and take into account the integration along the line of sight (LOS). The
main assumption we make is that no anisotropy in the kinetic temperature of the
coronal species is considered. We find that at distances greater than 1 Rsun
from the solar surface the widths of the emitted lines of O VI and Mg X are
sensitive to the details of the adopted electron density stratification.
However, Ly-$\alpha$, which is a pure radiative line, is hardly affected. The
calculated total intensities of Ly-$\alpha$ and the O VI doublet depend to a
lesser degree on the density stratification and are comparable to the observed
ones for most of the considered density models. The widths of the observed
profiles of Ly-$\alpha$ and Mg X are well reproduced by most of the considered
electron density stratifications, while for the O VI doublet only few
stratifications give satisfying results. The densities deduced from SOHO data
result in O VI profiles whose widths and intensity ratio are relatively close
to the values observed by UVCS although only isotropic velocity distributions
are employed. These density profiles also reproduce the other considered

more pronounced. In fact, almost half the CVs which populate the 3-4.5 h period
interval are definite members of the class. These statistics are confirmed by
our results from the Hamburg Quasar Survey CVs. Remarkably, 54 per cent of the
Hamburg nova-like variables have been identified as SW Sex stars with orbital
periods in the 3-4.5 h range. The observation of this pile-up of systems close
to the upper boundary of the period gap is difficult to reconcile with the
standard theory of CV evolution, as the SW Sex stars are believed to have the
highest mass transfer rates among CVs. Finally, we review the full range of
common properties that the SW Sex stars exhibit.
","In this study, we investigate the SW Sextantis stars, which are considered the dominant population of Cataclysmic Variables (CVs) with orbital periods between 3-4 hours. Our results shed light on the formation and evolution of CVs, and provide a new perspective in understanding the physical processes that govern their behaviour. The SW Sextantis stars are characterized by their high-state behaviour and complex light curves that exhibit an intricate array of periodic variations. This observation implies that the dominant mode of mass transfer in these systems is driven by gravitational radiation, which is the dominant mechanism for the majority of short-period CVs. This study contributes to the field of observational astronomy and provides critical insights for improving our understanding of the complex dynamics and evolution of CVs.

possibilities concerning the history and future of time, the least likely is
the conventional wisdom (time began and will never end) and most likely is a
cyclic model (time never begins or ends), is in the short final Chapter which

popular book, is that it will engender reflection about time. Many a
non-scientist may already hold a philosophical opinion about whether time
begins and ends. This book's aim is to present some recently discovered
scientific facts which can focus the reader's consideration of the two short
questions in my title.

to a new feature of dynamical difference equations which may not have constant

can be evaluated and what lattice refinements imply for semiclassical behavior.
Two detailed examples illustrate that stability conditions can put strong
constraints on suitable refinement models, even in the absence of a fundamental
Hamiltonian which defines changes of the underlying lattice. Thus, a large
class of consistency tests of loop quantum gravity becomes available. In this
context, it will also be seen that quantum corrections due to inverse powers of
metric components in a constraint are much larger than they appeared recently
in more special treatments of isotropic, free scalar models where they were
artificially suppressed.

the stability of the smectic phase may be greatly enhanced, and that this
effect can be rationalised in terms of depletion forces. In the present paper
we first study the effect of orientational order on depletion forces in this
particular binary system, comparing our results with those obtained adopting
the usual approximation of considering the rods parallel and their orientations
frozen. We consider mixtures with rods of different aspect ratios and spheres
of different diameters, and we treat them within Onsager theory. Our results
indicate that depletion effects, and consequently smectic stability, decrease
significantly as a result of orientational disorder in the smectic phase when
compared with corresponding data based on the frozen--orientation
approximation. These results are discussed in terms of the $\tau$ parameter,
which has been proposed as a convenient measure of depletion strength. We
present closed expressions for $\tau$, and show that it is intimately connected
with the depletion potential. We then analyse the effect of particle geometry
by comparing results pertaining to systems of parallel rods of different shapes
(spherocylinders, cylinders and parallelepipeds). We finally provide results
based on the Zwanzig approximation of a Fundamental--Measure
density--functional theory applied to mixtures of parallelepipeds and cubes of
different sizes. In this case, we show that the $\tau$ parameter exhibits a
linear asymptotic behaviour in the limit of large values of the hard--rod
aspect ratio, in conformity with Onsager theory, as well as in the limit of
large values of the ratio of rod breadth to cube side length, $d$, in contrast
to Onsager approximation, which predicts $\tau\sim d^3$.
","In this paper, we investigate the depletion effects in a mixture of hard rod-hard sphere and its implications on the properties of smectic phases. The motivation for this research stems from the fact that the study of smectic phases has significant implications not only for basic science but also for a wide range of practical applications such as in materials science, liquid crystal displays and drug delivery systems. The depletion effects in smectic phases of hard rod-hard sphere mixtures result from the interplay of the competition between the orientational ordering of the rods and the ordering of the spheres. This competition leads to a decrease in the effective excluded volume of the spheres, which, in turn, affects the properties of the smectic phases. We employ a combination of theoretical and simulation approaches to investigate these effects and to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying physics.

these bounds are relaxed for small values of A_t and large values of the

phase contains black hole-like objects. These so-called ``plasma puddles'' are
meta-stable lumps of hot plasma lying in locally un-Higgsed regions of space.
They decay via O(1/N) thermal radiation and, perhaps surprisingly, absorb all
incident matter. We show that an incident particle of energy E striking the
plasma puddle will shower into an enormous number of decay products whose
multiplicity grows linearly with E, and whose average energy is independent of
E. Once these ultra-soft particles reach the interior they are thermalized by
the plasma within, and so the object appears ``black.'' We determine some gross
properties like the size and temperature of the the plasma puddle in terms of
fundamental parameters in the gauge theory. Interestingly, demanding that the
plasma puddle emit thermal Hawking radiation implies that the object is black
(i.e. absorbs all incident particles), which implies classical stability, which
implies satisfaction of the Bekenstein entropy bound. Because of the AdS/CFT
duality and the many similarities between plasma puddles and black holes, we
conjecture that black objects are a robust feature of quantum gravity.
","In this work, we investigate the concept of the plasma puddle (PP) as a perturbative black hole. The PP is a confined plasma system, where gravity is negligible, and the fluid dynamics is the dominant force. We demonstrate that, when the PP is compressed, a density gradient is established that creates a gravitational field which is capable of trapping light, and therefore the PP acts as a black hole.

enhanced by letting the diffusion coefficient depend on the field. A yet less

discussing for this system the second aspect enumerated above, we derive from
it -through an adiabatic-like elimination of the inhibitor field- an effective

the range of the nonlocal kernel and its effect on stochastic resonance, we

twelve fields in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Our fields, located between
~1 and ~4 degrees from the center of the galaxy, are situated in different
parts of the SMC such as the ""Wing'' area, and towards the West and South. In
this paper we perform a first analysis of the stellar content in our SMC fields
through comparison with theoretical isochrones and color functions (CFs). We
find that the underlying spheroidally distributed population is composed of
both intermediate-age and old stars and that its age composition does not show
strong galacto-centric gradients. The three fields situated toward the east, in
the Wing region, show very active current star formation. However, only in the
eastern field closest to the center do we find an enhancement of recent star
formation with respect to a constant SFR(t). The fields corresponding to the
western side of the SMC present a much less populated young MS, and the CF
analysis indicates that the SFR(t) greatly diminished around 2 Gyr ago in these
parts. Field smc0057, the closest to the center of the galaxy and located in
the southern part, shows recent star formation, while the rest of the southern
fields present few bright MS stars. The structure of the red clump in all the
CMDs is consistent with the large amount of intermediate-age stars inferred
from the CMDs and color functions. None of the SMC fields presented here are
dominated by old stellar populations, a fact that is in agreement with the lack
of a conspicuous horizontal branch in all these SMC CMDs. This could indicate
that a disk population is ruling over a possible old halo in all the observed
fields.

by gravity. Such limits arise because both information and its processing
require energy, while gravitational collapse (formation of a horizon or black
hole) restricts the amount of energy allowed in a finite region. Specifically,
I use a criterion for gravitational collapse called the hoop conjecture. Once
the hoop conjecture is assumed a number of results can be obtained directly:
the existence of a fundamental uncertainty in spatial distance of order the
Planck length, bounds on information (entropy) in a finite region, and a bound
on the rate of information processing in a finite region. In the final section
I discuss some cosmological issues related to the total amount of information
in the universe, and note that almost all detailed aspects of the late universe
are determined by the randomness of quantum outcomes. This paper is based on a

noise-induced, ordering phase transition (NIPT) were assumed to be Gaussian and
white in the model of [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{73}, 3395 (1994)]. The
potential scientific and technological interest of this phenomenon calls for a
study of the effects of the noises' statistics and spectrum. This task is
facilitated if these noises are dynamically generated by means of stochastic
differential equations (SDE) driven by white noises. One such case is that of
Ornstein--Uhlenbeck noises which are stationary, with Gaussian pdf and a
variance reduced by the self-correlation time (\tau), and whose effect on the
NIPT phase diagram has been studied some time ago. Another such case is when
the stationary pdf is a (colored) Tsallis' (q)--\emph{Gaussian} which, being a
\emph{fat-tail} distribution for (q>1) and a \emph{compact-support} one for
(q<1), allows for a controlled exploration of the effects of the departure from
Gaussian statistics. As done before with stochastic resonance and other
phenomena, we now exploit this tool to study--within a simple mean-field
approximation and with an emphasis on the \emph{order parameter} and the
``\emph{susceptibility}''--the combined effect on NIPT of the noises'
statistics and spectrum. Even for relatively small (\tau), it is shown that
whereas fat-tail noise distributions ((q>1)) counteract the effect of
self-correlation, compact-support ones ((q<1)) enhance it. Also, an interesting
effect on the susceptibility is seen in the last case.

in the mid-infrared from 5-35 um. These observations allow us to investigate
mid-IR emission mechanisms in the core of M87 and to establish that the
flaring, variable jet component HST-1 is not a major contributor to the mid-IR
flux. The Spitzer data include a high signal-to-noise 15-35 $\mu$m spectrum of
the knot A/B complex in the jet, which is consistent with synchrotron emission.
However, a synchrotron model cannot account for the observed {\it nuclear}
spectrum, even when contributions from the jet, necessary due to the degrading
of resolution with wavelength, are included. The Spitzer data show a clear
excess in the spectrum of the nucleus at wavelengths longer than 25 um, which
we model as thermal emission from cool dust at a characteristic temperature of
55 \pm 10 K, with an IR luminosity \sim 10^{39} {\rm ~erg ~s^{-1}}. Given
Spitzer's few-arcsecond angular resolution, the dust seen in the nuclear

not contain the IR-bright torus that classical unified AGN schemes invoke.

of their properties and allows their characterization. Eighteen remnant
candidates are analyzed by means of photometric and proper motion data. These
data provide information on objects and their fields. We establish criteria for
characterizing open cluster remnants, taking observational uncertainties into
account. 2MASS J and H photometry is employed (i) to study structural
properties of the objects by means of radial stellar density profiles, (ii) to
test for any similarity between objects and fields with a statistical
comparison method applied to the distributions of stars in the CMDs, and (iii)
to obtain ages, reddening values, and distances from the CMD, taking an index
of isochrone fit into account. The UCAC2 proper motions allowed an objective
comparison between objects and large solid angle offset fields. The objective
analysis based on the present methods indicates 13 open-cluster remnants in the
sample. Evidence of the presence of binary stars is found, as expected for
dynamically evolved systems. Finally, we infer possible evolutionary stages
among remnants from the structure, proper motion, and CMD distributions. The
low stellar statistics for individual objects is overcome by means of the
construction of composite proper motion and CMD diagrams. The distributions of
remnants in the composite diagrams resemble the single-star and unresolved

synchronization order parameter and the critical point of 1) the full
phase-locking transition for a system with a finite number of oscillators

sample into 158 metal-rich ([Fe/H] > -1.0) and 178 metal-poor ([Fe/H] < -1.0)
globular clusters. Our results show the kinematics of the metal-rich and
metal-poor subpopulations are quite similar. The kinematics are compared to the
planetary nebula population where differences are apparent in the outer regions
of the halo. The total mass of NGC 5128 is found using the Tracer Mass

random motions, and the spherical component of the Jeans equation to determine
the mass supported by rotation. We find a total mass of (1.0+/-0.2) x 10^(12)

We obtained spectroscopic data using the Two-degree Field (2dF) instrument on the Anglo-Australian Telescope, which allows us to study the distribution and velocity of the globular clusters and PNe across the galaxy. To further understand the dynamics of NGC 5128, we constructed models using the Monte Carlo method and compared our results with observations. Our results reveal a clear spatial correlation between the most luminous PNe and the globular clusters, indicating that these objects may have formed during the same epoch.

exhibited low RMS velocity scatter after three consecutive observations.
However, follow-up observations over the last three years now reveal the
presence of longer period planets with orbital periods ranging from 21 days to
a few years. HD 11506 is a G0V star with a planet of \msini = 4.74 \mjup in a
3.85 year orbit. HD 17156 is a G0V star with a 3.12 \mjup planet in a 21.2 day
orbit. The eccentricity of this orbit is 0.67, one of the highest known for a
planet with a relatively short period. The orbital period for this planet
places it in a region of parameter space where relatively few planets have been
detected. HD 125612 is a G3V star with a planet of \msini = 3.5 \mjup in a 1.4

variability. A transit search conducted for HD 17156 was negative but covered
only 25% of the search space and so is not conclusive.

Synthesis Radio Telescope operated in a tied-array mode at a frequency of 1200
MHz. The PuMa pulsar backend provided voltage recording of X and Y linear
polarization states in two conjugate 10 MHz bands. We restricted the time
resolution to 4 microseconds to match the scattering on the interstellar
inhomogeneities. In total about 18000 giant pulses (GP) were detected in full
intensity with a threshold level of 6 sigma. Cumulative probability
distributions (CPD) of giant pulse energies were analyzed for groups of GPs
with different effective widths in the range 4 to 65 microseconds. The CPDs
were found to manifest notable differences for the different GP width groups.
The slope of a power-law fit to the high-energy portion of the CPDs evolves
from -1.7 to -3.2 when going from the shortest to the longest GPs. There are
breaks in the CPD power-law fits indicating flattening at low energies with
indices varying from -1.0 to -1.9 for the short and long GPs respectively. The
GPs with a stronger peak flux density were found to be of shorter duration. We

sensitivities of AB system colours that relate to u, B, g, V, r, R, i, I, z, J,
H, and K bands are presented, and the abilities of various colour pairs for
breaking the age--metallicity degeneracy are quantified by an uncertainty
parameter (UP) method. Our results suggest that a few pairs of colours can be
used to constrain the two above stellar-population parameters. This will be
very useful for exploring the stellar populations of distant galaxies. In
detail, colour pairs [(r-K), (u-R)] and [(r-K), (u-r)] are shown to be the best
pairs for estimating stellar ages and metallicities. They can constrain two
stellar-population parameters on average with age uncertainties less than 3.89
Gyr and metallicity uncertainties less than 0.34 dex for typical uncertainties

Our results show that the use of colour pairs can significantly improve the accuracy of age and metallicity determinations, reducing the potential biases caused by differences in dust extinction and star formation histories. Furthermore, we demonstrate the versatility of this technique, showing that it can be applied to a wide range of galaxies with varying properties. Overall, our use of colour pairs provides a valuable tool for constraining stellar ages and metallicities, while also improving our understanding of galaxy evolution.

Saturn prevented Type II migration from driving these planets much closer to
the Sun. Our work extends previous results by Masset and Snellgrove (2001), by
exploring a wider set of initial conditions and disk parameters, and by using a
new hydrodynamical code that properly describes for the global viscous
evolution of the disk. Initially both planets migrate towards the Sun, and
Saturn's migration tends to be faster. As a consequence, they eventually end up
locked in a mean motion resonance. If this happens in the 2:3 resonance, the
resonant motion is particularly stable, and the gaps opened by the planets in
the disk may overlap. This causes a drastic change in the torque balance for
the two planets, which substantially slows down the planets' inward migration.
If the gap overlap is substantial, planet migration may even be stopped or
reversed. As the widths of the gaps depend on disk viscosity and scale height,
this mechanism is particularly efficient in low viscosity, cool disks. We
discuss the compatibility of our results with the initial conditions adopted in

orbital eccentricities (< 0.27) indicating that their second-born neutron stars
received only very small velocity kicks at birth. This is similar to the case
of the B-emission X-ray binaries, where a sizable fraction of the neutron stars
received hardly any velocity kick at birth (Pfahl et al. 2002). The masses of
the second-born neutron stars in five of the six low-eccentricity double
neutron stars are remarkably low (between 1.18 and 1.30 Msun). It is argued
that these low-mass, low-kick neutron stars were formed by the electron-capture
collapse of the degenerate O-Ne-Mg cores of helium stars less massive than
about 3.5 Msun, whereas the higher-mass, higher kick-velocity neutron stars
were formed by the collapses of the iron cores of higher initial mass. The
absence of low-velocity single young radio pulsars (Hobbs et al. 2005) is
consistent with the model proposed by Podsiadlowski et al. (2004), in which the
electron-capture collapse of degenerate O-Ne-Mg cores can only occur in binary
systems, and not in single stars.

Our results suggest that both formation mechanisms are important in producing DNS systems, and that the relative contribution of each mechanism depends on the properties of the binary system. We have analyzed a sample of 17 DNS systems and found evidence for two different formation mechanisms. The first mechanism involves the collapse of massive stars into neutron stars, followed by a common envelope phase in which the two neutron stars form a close binary system. The second mechanism involves the evolution of low-mass X-ray binaries, where the neutron star accretes material from a companion star and eventually forms a DNS system.

galactic nuclei (AGN) in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation. We
assume that a fraction of jet energy, which is generated by an AGN, is
transferred to the surrounding gas as thermal energy. Combining a theoretical
model of mass accretion onto black holes with a multiphase description of
star-forming gas, we self-consistently follow evolution of both galaxies and
their central black holes. The novelty in our model is that we consider two
distinct accretion modes: standard radiatively efficient thin accretion disks
and radiatively inefficient accretion flows which we will generically refer to
as RIAFs; motivated by theoretical models for jet production in accretion
disks, we assume that only the RIAF is responsible for the AGN feedback. We
find that, after an initial episode of bursting star formation, the accretion
rate onto the central black hole drops so that the accretion disk switches to a
RIAF structure. At this point, the feedback from the AGN becomes efficient and
slightly suppresses star formation in the galactic disk and almost completely
halts star formation in the bulge. As a result, the nucleus becomes a
stochastically fuelled low-luminosity AGN (Seyfert galaxy) with recurrent
short-lived episodes of activity after the star bursts. Our model predicts
several properties of the low-luminosity AGN including the bolometric
luminosity, jet powers, the effect on kpc-scale of the radio jet and the AGN
lifetime, which are in broad agreement with observations of Seyfert galaxies
and their radio activity. We also find that the mass ratios between the central
black hole and the the host spheroid at z = 0 are ~10^{-3} regardless of the
strength of either supernova feedback or AGN feedback. (abridged)
","In this study, we investigate the impact of radio feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) in cosmological simulations on the formation of disk galaxies. The formation of disk galaxies is a complex process that requires the cooling and condensation of gas in dark matter halos. It has been suggested that feedback from AGN plays a crucial role in regulating this process, but the specifics of this interaction are not well understood. Our research aims to address this knowledge gap by running cosmological simulations of galaxy formation with varying levels of AGN feedback. In simulations with strong feedback, massive black holes actively suppress the formation of extended disks by heating and disrupting gas in the surrounding halo. However, in simulations with weak feedback, the growth of disk galaxies is less inhibited, leading to the formation of more extended and rotationally supported structures.

observation of 2p--2s fine structure lines from the neutral hydrogen outside
the cosmological H {\sc ii} regions enveloping QSOs and other ionizing sources
in the reionization era. We show that for parameters typical of luminous
sources observed at $z \simeq 6.3$ the strength of this signal, which is
proportional to the H {\sc i} fraction, has a brightness temperature $\simeq 20
  \mu K$ for a fully neutral medium. The fine structure line from this redshift
is observable at $\nu \simeq 1 \rm GHz$ and we discuss prospects for the
detection with several operational and future radio telescopes. We also compute
the characteristics of this signal from the epoch of recombination: the peak
brightness is expected to be $\simeq 100 \mu K$; this signal appears in the
frequency range 5-10 MHz. The signal from the recombination era is nearly
impossible to detect owing to the extreme brightness of the Galactic emission
at these frequencies.
","In this work, we investigate the hydrogen 2p--2s transition signals from the epochs of recombination and reionization. Our study aims to solve the problem of understanding the role of the hydrogen 2p--2s transition in the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) and the reionization of the universe. Our motivation for our research arises from the fact that the 2p--2s transition plays a significant role in shaping the CMB due to its resonant nature. Another motivation is that the 2p--2s transition is a probe of the gas temperature and density during reionization. Our main findings show that the 2p--2s transition is indeed a powerful probe of the free electron fraction during reionization. We also find that the 2p--2s absorption feature does not significantly impact the CMB power spectrum but can leave an imprint on the CMB polarization spectrum. In a word, our work highlights the importance of the hydrogen 2p--2s transition in understanding the CMB and the reionization of the universe. Our results provide useful insights for future observations and cosmological simulations aiming to constrain the epoch of reionization.

associated to dust millimeter cores of the Vela Molecular Ridge Cloud D through
new IR observations (H_2 narrow-band at 2.12 micron and N broad band at 10.4

The association of mm continuum emission with infrared sources from catalogues
(IRAS, MSX, 2MASS), JHK data from the literature and new observations, has been
established according to spatial coincidence, infrared colours and spectral
energy distributions. Only 7 out of 29 resolved mm cores (and 16 out of the 26
unresolved ones) do not exhibit signposts of star formation activity. The other
ones are clearly associated with: far-IR sources, H_2 jets or near-IR objects
showing a high intrinsic colour excess. The distribution of the spectral
indices pertaining to the associated sources is peaked at values typical of
Class I objects, while three objects are signalled as candidates Class 0
sources. We remark the high detection rate (30%) of H_2 jets driven by sources
located inside the mm-cores. They appear not driven by the most luminous
objects in the field, but rather by less luminous objects in young clusters,
testifying the co-existence of both low- and intermediate-mass star formation.
The presented results reliably describe the young population of VMR-D. However,
the statistical evaluation of activity vs inactivity of the investigated cores,
even in good agreement with results found for other star forming regions, seems
to reflect the limiting sensitivity of the available facilities rather than any
property intrinsic to the mm-condensations.

$N(t)$ is found to decrease monotonically from one to zero, while the magnitude
of the Stokes vector $|\vec{\zeta}(t)|$ increases monotonically from zero to
one. This property qualifies these observables as arrows of time. Requiring
monotonic behaviour of $N(t)$ for arbitrary values of $\gamma_L, \gamma_S$ and
$\Delta m$ yields a bound on the CP-violating overlap $\delta =
\braket{K_L}{K_S}$, which is similar to, but weaker than, the known unitarity

the CP-violating overlap in the $B^0$-$\bar{B^0}$ system. We obtain the Stokes

relatively small. The variances of partial contributions themselves are quite
different between the smaller and the larger particles, with the larger

partial fill factors increases with the particle size ratio. The additional
variance in the partial contribution of smaller particle originates from the
fluctuations in the size of gaps between larger particles. We discuss the

reported for the peculiar A supergiant, single-lined spectroscopic binary HR
4049. Lines from the CO fundamental and first overtone, OH fundamental, and
several H2O vibration-rotation transitions have been observed in the
near-infrared spectrum. The spectrum of HR 4049 appears principally in emission
through the 3 and 4.6 micron region and in absorption in the 2 micron region.
The 4.6 micron spectrum shows a rich 'forest' of emission lines. All the
spectral lines observed in the 2.3-4.6 micron spectrum are shown to be
circumbinary in origin. The presence of OH and H2O lines confirm the
oxygen-rich nature of the circumbinary gas which is in contrast to the
previously detected carbon-rich material. The emission and absorption line
profiles show that the circumbinary gas is located in a thin, rotating layer
near the dust disk. The properties of the dust and gas circumbinary disk and
the spectroscopic orbit yield masses for the individual stars, M_AI~0.58 Msolar
and M_MV~0.34 Msolar. Gas in the disk also has an outward flow with a velocity
of $\gtrsim$ 1 km/s. The severe depletion of refractory elements but near-solar
abundances of volatile elements observed in HR 4049 results from abundance
winnowing. The separation of the volatiles from the grains in the disk and the
subsequent accretion by the star are discussed. Contrary to prior reports, the
HR 4049 carbon and oxygen isotopic abundances are typical AGB values:
12C/13C=6^{+9}_{-4} and 16O/17O>200.
","We present the results of our high-resolution spectroscopic analysis of the post-Asymptotic Giant Branch (post-AGB) star, HR 4049.

We have analyzed these lines using radiative transfer models to infer the physical properties of the disk, such as its density, temperature and velocity structure. Our results suggest the presence of a fast, collimated outflow in the disk, possibly caused by the interaction between the stellar wind and the disk material, which may be responsible for the observed depletion of refractory elements in the stellar photosphere, known as the ""winnowing effect"".

days with exceptionally good time sampling. The optical photometry was
calibrated through the S-correction technique.
  The UBVRIJHK light curves and the color indices of SN 2003du closely resemble
those of normal SNe Ia. SN 2003du reached a B-band maximum of 13.49 (+/-0.02)
mag on JD2452766.38 (+/-0.5). We derive a B-band stretch parameter of 0.988
(+/-0.003), which corresponds to dM15=1.02 (+/-0.05), indicative of a SN Ia of
standard luminosity. The reddening in the host galaxy was estimated by three
methods, and was consistently found to be negligible. We estimate a distance
modulus of 32.79 (+/-0.15) mag to the host galaxy, UGC 9391. The peak UVOIR
bolometric luminosity of 1.35(+/-0.20) 10^43 erg/s and Arnett's rule implies
that M(Ni56)=0.68 (+/-0.14)M_sun of Ni56 was synthesized during the explosion.
Modeling of the UVOIR bolometric light curve also indicates M(Ni56) in the
range 0.6-0.8 M_sun. The spectral evolution of SN 2003du at both optical and
NIR wavelengths also closely resembles normal SNe Ia. In particular, the Si II
ratio at maximum R(Si II)=0.22 (+/-0.02) and the time evolution of the
blueshift velocities of the absorption line minima are typical. The pre-maximum
spectra of SN 2003du showed conspicuous high-velocity features in the Ca II H&K
doublet and infrared triplet, and possibly in Si II 6355, lines. We compare the
time evolution of the profiles of these lines with other well-observed SNe Ia

In conclusion, our observations highlight the value of continuous follow-up of individual supernovae for a better understanding of their diversity and physical properties. A unique spectroscopic feature, the presence of the Ca II IR triplet at early phases, shows a connection between akin II-P and II-L SN and subclass Ia SN.

ongoing shocks to replenish the SiO. We serendipitously detected SO$_2$ towards
17 sources in the same tuning as HCO$^+$. We detected HCO$^+$ towards all

candidates, we estimate mass infall rates between 1$\times10^{-2}$ and
2$\times10^{-5}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. Seven sources show both SiO detections
(young outflows) and HCO$^+$ infall signatures. We also find that the abundance
of H$^{13}$CO$^+$ tends to increase along with the abundance of SiO in sources
for which we could determine abundances. We discuss these results with respect
to current theories of massive star formation via accretion. From this survey,
we suggest that perhaps both models of ionized accretion and halted accretion

protostars) beyond the formation of an HII region.

large-Nc limit from the mathematical theory of Pade Approximants to meromorphic
functions. These approximants are rational functions which encompass any
saturation with a finite number of resonances as a particular example,
explaining several results which have appeared in the literature. We review the
main properties of Pade Approximants with the help of a toy model for the
<VV-AA> two-point correlator, paying particular attention to the relationship
among the Chiral Expansion, the Operator Product Expansion and the resonance
spectrum. In passing, we also comment on an old proposal made by Migdal in 1977
which has recently attracted much attention in the context of AdS/QCD models.
Finally, we apply the simplest Pade Approximant to the <VV-AA> correlator in
the real case of QCD. The general conclusion is that a rational approximant may
reliably describe a Green's function in the Euclidean, but the same is not true
in the Minkowski regime due to the appearance of unphysical poles and/or
residues.
","In this work, we propose a rational approach to understanding resonance saturation in large-Nc QCD. Our methodology involves a detailed analysis of the low-energy effective Lagrangian, which allows us to extract the necessary information to investigate the resonance saturation phenomenon. The results we obtain demonstrate that the large-Nc limit provides a powerful tool for studying resonance dynamics, and allows us to understand the behaviors of resonances in a theoretically solid way. The results we obtain demonstrate that the large-Nc limit provides a powerful tool for studying the relationship between resonance masses and their coupling strengths.

structural instabilities on magnetic ordering can be understood in terms of how
super-exchange interactions depend on the Cr-O-Cr bond angles and Cr-O bond

Momentum transfer of the dumbbells with the solvent is implemented by an
additional volume forcing term in the Navier-Stokes equations, such that both
components of the resulting viscoelastic fluid are connected by a two-way
coupling. The dynamics of the dumbbells is given then by Newton's second law of
motion including small inertia effects. We investigate the dynamics of the flow

Weissenberg and Stokes numbers, respectively. For the parameters accessible in
our study, the magnitude of the feedback of the polymers on the macroscopic
properties of turbulence remains small as quantified by the global energy
budget and the Reynolds stresses. A reduction of the turbulent drag by up to
20% is observed for the larger particle inertia. The angular statistics of the
dumbbells shows an increasing alignment with the mean flow direction for both,
increasing elasticity and inertia. This goes in line with a growing asymmetry

quantum gravity effects are expected to induce proton instability, indicating
that the higher energy cutoff scale must be above 10^{16}GeV. Quasi-realistic
heterotic string models provide the arena to explore how perturbative quantum
gravity affects the particle physics phenomenology. An appealing explanation
for the proton longevity is provided by the existence of an Abelian gauge
symmetry that suppresses the proton decay mediating operators. Additionally,
such a low-scale U(1) symmetry should: allow the suppression of the left-handed
neutrino masses by a seesaw mechanism; allow fermion Yukawa couplings to the

color. Using the cavity method, we present a detailed and systematic analytical
study of the space of proper colorings (solutions).
  We show that for a fixed number of colors and as the average vertex degree
(number of constraints) increases, the set of solutions undergoes several phase
transitions similar to those observed in the mean field theory of glasses.
First, at the clustering transition, the entropically dominant part of the
phase space decomposes into an exponential number of pure states so that beyond
this transition a uniform sampling of solutions becomes hard. Afterward, the
space of solutions condenses over a finite number of the largest states and
consequently the total entropy of solutions becomes smaller than the annealed
one. Another transition takes place when in all the entropically dominant
states a finite fraction of nodes freezes so that each of these nodes is
allowed a single color in all the solutions inside the state. Eventually, above
the coloring threshold, no more solutions are available. We compute all the
critical connectivities for Erdos-Renyi and regular random graphs and determine
their asymptotic values for large number of colors.
  Finally, we discuss the algorithmic consequences of our findings. We argue
that the onset of computational hardness is not associated with the clustering
transition and we suggest instead that the freezing transition might be the
relevant phenomenon. We also discuss the performance of a simple local Walk-COL
algorithm and of the belief propagation algorithm in the light of our results.

ignore the relationship between the sample point locations and the associated

1-2 M_sun. The models were constructed using a code based on a reformulation of
the self-consistent field method of computing the equilibrium stellar structure
for a specified conservative internal rotation law. [abridged] Relative to
nonrotating stars of the same mass, these models all have reduced luminosities
and effective temperatures, and flattened photospheric shapes (i.e., decreased
polar radii) with equatorial radii that can be larger or smaller, depending on
the degree of differential rotation. For a fixed ratio of the axial rotation
rate to the surface equatorial rotation rate, increasingly rapid rotation
generally deepens convective envelopes, shrinks convective cores, and can lead
to the presence of a convective core (envelope) in a 1 M_sun (2 M_sun) model, a
feature that is absent in a nonrotating star of the same mass. The positions of
differentially rotating models for a given mass M in the H-R diagram can be
shifted in such a way as to approximate the nonrotating ZAMS over ranges in
luminosity and effective temperature that correspond to a mass interval between
M and about 0.7 M. We briefly note a few of the implications of these results,

properties of rotating and nonrotating models of different masses, (ii) a
reduced radiative luminosity for a young, rapidly rotating Sun, (iii) the

transported through its surface layers. We study the resulting differentially
rotating profile, focusing on the impact this has for type I X-ray bursts. The
predominant viscosity is likely provided by the Tayler-Spruit dynamo. The
radial and azimuthal magnetic field components have strengths of ~10^5 G and
~10^10 G, respectively. This leads to nearly uniform rotation at the depths of
interest for X-ray bursts. A remaining small shear transmits the accreted
angular momentum inward to the NS interior. Though this shear gives little
viscous heating, it can trigger turbulent mixing. Detailed simulations will be
required to fully understand the consequences of mixing, but our models
illustrate some general features. Mixing has the greatest impact when the
buoyancy at the compositional discontinuity between accreted matter and ashes
is overcome. This occurs at high accretion rates, at low spin frequencies, or
may depend on the ashes from the previous burst. We then find two new regimes
of burning. The first is ignition in a layer containing a mixture of heavier
elements from the ashes. If ignition occurs at the base of the mixed layer,
recurrence times as short as ~5-30 minutes are possible. This may explain the
short recurrence time of some bursts, but incomplete burning is still needed to
explain these bursts' energetics. When mixing is sufficiently strong, a second
regime is found where accreted helium mixes deep enough to burn stably,
quenching X-ray bursts. We speculate that the observed change in X-ray burst
properties near one-tenth the Eddington accretion rate is from this mechanism.
The carbon-rich material produced by stable helium burning would be important

While previous work has explored the basic features of turbulent mixing, they have not taken into account the unique conditions present in accreting neutron stars. We use a combination of numerical simulations and analytical methods to investigate the behavior of the turbulent mixing process, and compare our results with observations of real-world accreting neutron stars. Our key ideas and methodology involve the development of a new mathematical model that incorporates the relevant physics involved in turbulent mixing in accreting neutron stars.
