Office de Radiodiffusion-Télévision du Mali,"The Office of Radio and Television of Mali (Office de radiodiffusion et de télévision du Mali, ORTM) is the national broadcaster of the West African state of Mali.  History Malian broadcasting began in 1957 as a one kilowatt radio station called Radio Soudan in Bamako, then administrative center of the French colony of French Soudan. After independence in 1960, Radio Nationale du Mali (Radio-Mali) began broadcasting from la maison de la Radio in the Bozola neighbourhood of Bamako.  Technical abilities were bolstered with Czech transmitters ranging from 18 to 30 kilowatts in 1962.  In 1970, the Chinese government constructed four 50 kW radio transmitters about 7 km from Bamako, towards Kati, enabling Radio Mali to reach much of West Africa. In 22 September 1983, a Libyan financed television broadcast centre was opened in Bamako, enabling RTM to broadcast one channel of colour television. French and German grant programmes between 1984 and 1990 enabled news and reporting to expand, with regional stations opening in Ségou (1986), Koulikoro (1989), Sikasso (1990) and Mopti (1993). In 1992, a second national broadcast radio network (Chiffre II) was added.  On 5 October 1992, the Malian government split off the RTM  according to ""Law 92-021"", from direct government control, becoming a publicly financed, independently run entity (an ""Établissement Public à Caractère Administratif (EPA)""). This was part of the national liberalisation process, moving the nation to the ""Third Malian Republic"". Private broadcasters were legalised, and RTM was reorganised as the ORTM on 1 January 1993.  ORTM was seized by National Committee for the Restoration of Democracy and State (CNRDR) forces on 21 March 2012 as part of the 2012 Malian coup d'état. A thousand-person protest was held on 26 March, chanting ""Down with Sanogo"" and ""Liberate the ORTM"".  Current output In 2002, ORTM had 35 local radio and/or television broadcast points or repeaters, with TV/radio broadcast points in all eight Regions of Mali.  From its headquarters in Bamako, ORTM produces two radio networks (RTM and Chiffre II), a national television network (RTM), and directs the work of a number of regional RTM radio stations.  Considered one of the freest news markets in Africa, although government office holders threaten (and sometimes resort to) prosecution of broadcasters under Mali's strict anti-libel laws.  In 2001, the head of OTRM was threatened with jail after the government attempted to prosecute RTM for an interview in which the mayor of Bamako accused the Malian judiciary of corruption.  Since 1992, broadcasting is no longer a state monopoly.  There are two large private multi-channel television providers, and numerous private radio stations.  Mali is also considered a world leader in community radio development, with ORTM helping to set up the Union des Radios et Televisions Libres (URTEL) , a network of over a hundred independently locally operated stations.  OTRM also partners with other government and international organisations in education and development programs throughout Mali.  Programming RTM Radio and television broadcast news and information programming, light entertainment (both foreign and domestic), music and sport.  Most national broadcasts are in French, with several hours of Bambara language programming, as well as regional broadcasting in other languages. Emission Hebdomadaire d'Information, the weekly ORTM news magazine, has been broadcasting each Sunday at noon since 1998, and is anchored by Manga Dembélé and Youssouf Touré.  A daily news program is broadcast twice daily.  Chiffre II radio network is simulcast on the OTRM website, while television broadcasts are carried on regional satellite.  ORTM television regularly broadcasts local sport, mostly  Malien Première Division football matches, to an eager audience at least three days a week.

Before We Go,"Before We Go is a 2014 American romantic drama film directed by Chris Evans in his directorial debut. It stars Evans (who also co-produced) and Alice Eve as two strangers stuck in Manhattan, New York City for the night.  The film had its world premiere in the Special Presentations section of the 39th Toronto International Film Festival on September 12, 2014. It was released on video on demand on July 21, 2015 and had a limited theatrical release in the United States on September 4, 2015.  Plot  While busking in Grand Central Terminal, Nick Vaughan (Chris Evans) sees Brooke Dalton (Alice Eve), drop her phone while running to catch a train. She misses it and passes by and he returns her broken phone.   Nick finds Brooke standing outside and she admits she was just robbed and is trapped in the city. Offering to pay for a cab to Boston for $500, he finds he has only $90 and neither of his cards work. Trying to call a friend to come help, he's out of charge. He offers to pay for a room for Brooke (or walk her to a hotel as she seems to have no sense of direction), but she insists she must travel home.  Nick decides to help Brooke find her missing purse as then she might get her ID and cards back if the thieves just took her cash. They search trash cans in the pub she was in and then bribe the bar owner for information. They track the purse down to a sweatshop with a sideline in stolen purses. As Nick heads inside to retrieve it, Brooke calls her husband on a payphone and he says he is returning home early and they could have breakfast by 8. Evidently, he does not know she is still in New York. After the call, Brooke sends a couple of police officers to investigate the building Nick is in. The sweatshop owners get spooked seeing them on CCTV, and punch Nick, who runs out with the bag.   Nick and Brooke go to the wedding party of a friend of Nick's, hoping to borrow $450 for a hire car for Brooke. Along the way, they open up to each other. Brooke had just sold a painting and was going to surprise her husband by coming home early. Nick has an audition for a band that he has wanted to play with for a long time.   Instead of the wedding, they stumble upon an event where they are mistaken for members of the band and Nick negotiates for a 10% upfront fee of $500 and the organiser goes off to fetch cash. Nick and Brooke perform ""My Funny Valentine"" whilst waiting but then flee when the real band shows up. Alas, they still have no money.   Nick suddenly thinks of Brooke taking a Chinatown bus which might cost as little as $90 - but they don't even have that, since Nick spent his money bribing the bartender. Brooke borrows a phone in a laundrette, asking a friend to retrieve the letter she left for her husband at home that she now does not want him to read.  Elated her problem is now solved, Brooke offers to go to Nick's friend's wedding and act as his girlfriend in front of his ex, Hannah. There, Nick sees Hannah, but after meeting her new boyfriend, he leaves abruptly. Outside, Nick tells Brooke that this was the first time he had seen Hannah since she broke up with him before he could propose six years ago.   At Brooke's insistence, Nick goes back to speak to Hannah and discovers that she is pregnant and their relationship is truly over. Wandering around the city, they find a psychic who is still open. After he reads her future, he allows Brooke to use his phone and she learns her friend could not get into her home to retrieve the letter.  After leaving the psychic, Brooke tells Nick she discovered her husband was cheating on her. Though he ended the affair, she found out he was going to see the woman again. Devastated, she wrote him a letter ending the marriage and went to New York for work. However, when she called him from the payphone earlier that night, she realized he wasn't meeting the woman as he was coming home early. Thus she regretted her decision to leave him.  At a diner, Nick tells Brooke her husband will likely understand why she wrote the letter. She, preoccupied about the possible end of her marriage, sneaks out the back, trying to hail a cab to the airport to fly to her mother's in Indiana - even though she has neither money nor identification. Nick appears, frustrated she had tried to bail on him, and tells the cab driver Brooke is going to rip him off. He tells Brooke that she’s just running away from her problems. The cab drives off.  The two go back to Nick's friend's hotel room to get out of the cold and unwind from the night's adventures. They then share a kiss, write on the back of paintings in the room (a reference to an earlier encounter with a painting with erotic writing on the back of it), and reflect on their night.  In the morning, they return to Grand Central Station where they are about to part. Nick picks up a receiver again from a phone booth and, like earlier, uses it as a ""time machine"", pretending to call himself in the past, saying that he will meet a woman and ""you will need her more than she needs you"". They share one last kiss and finally depart. On her way home, Brooke finds the hotel guest service paper they had filled out together. On the bottom it says, ""Turn over"". After reading what he wrote on the back, she smiles.

The site's critics consensus reads, ""Chris Evans' directorial debut is modest to a fault, with a threadbare story and minimal style leaving his and Alice Eve's likable performances adrift in New York City with nowhere to go."" Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 31 out of 100, based on 10 critics, indicating ""generally unfavorable reviews"".

François Cacault,"François Cacault (1742, Nantes – 10 October 1805, Clisson) was a French diplomat of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic periods.  Life François's father was a master artist in faience, road engineer and designer of a 1775 map of Nantes which served as the basis for plans to embellish the town. François began his career by training at the Ecole militaire in Paris, where he was made professor of fortifications in 1764 and inspector of studies in 1766. He resigned in 1769 and, forced into exile following a duel, travelled around Europe and got to know its artistic and literary circles. In 1775 he became the secretary of marshal d'Aubeterre, governor of Brittany, following him to Italy in 1785. Also in 1785 he began his diplomatic career as secretary to Talleyrand, then ambassador to the court of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies in Naples. In 1788 and 1791, he took on the duties of a chargé d'affaires but was recalled to France due to his meetings with anti-revolutionary émigrés. In 1793, he was sent out as France's ambassador to the Holy See but was forced by the riots of that year to sell all the lands and goods of French foundations in Rome, forcing the closure of the Académie de France there and the repatriation of its French artists. However, also in 1793, he managed to detach Tuscany from the First Coalition against France.  In 1796 Cacault became French minister in Rome to oversee the implementation of the Armistice of Bologna.  On 10 February 1797 he was the second French signatory of the Treaty of Tolentino, at Bonaparte's side as French chargé d'affaires in Italy. On 27 germinal year VI (16 April 1798), he was elected as député for Loire-Inférieure to the Council of Five Hundred. After the 18 brumaire coup d'état, Cacault rallied to Napoleon and on 4 nivôse year VIII (25 December 1799) entered the Corps législatif as député for Loire-Inférieure. He was then one of the negotiators for the Concordat of 1801. From year IX (1802) to year XI (1804) he was minister plenipotentiary in Rome, before joining the Sénat conservateur on 6 germinal year XII (27 March 1804).  A friend of letters and the arts, he translated many German works into French. During his stay in Italy he bought sculptures, more than a thousand paintings and over 5,000 prints, representative of Western European art from the end of the 13th century to the start of the 19th century. Conditions were highly favourable for this collection's formation, and Cacault was probably advised by the painter-collector Jean-Baptiste Wicar. They were both present in the art market, notably with the ""brocanteur"" or market-dealer Corazetto in piazza Navona and amidst works seized from churches and convents by the French occupiers and the suppression between 1798 and 1802 of a ban on exporting works of art from the Papal States. François's younger brother Pierre had stayed in Clisson since 1796, and there they founded a museum that aimed to display François's collection, to contribute to the spread of good taste and beauty and to favour arts studies. This ""museum-school"" arose from a passion for art and witnesses to the political context which affirmed the will to make all works of art accessible, within an ideal of artistic education. The Cacault collection was bought in 1801 by the town of Nantes, forming the foundation of the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Nantes.

Shams-ud-din Harifal,"Shams-ud-din Harifal (Urdu: ) was an (4 May 1944 - 14 March 1974) was an Islamic Sunni Hanafi scholar of the Deobandi school of thought and political leader of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam and Tehreek-e-Khatme-e-Nubuwwat. According to his biographer, Shams-ud-din's major contribution was his support of strong anti-Ahmadiyya feelings among Muslims at the risk and sacrifice of his life.  Early life and education  He was born on 4 May 1944 (21 Jumada al-awwal 1364 AH) in Balkh Province of Afghanistan to a family of religious scholars. His father Muhammad Zahid Harifal was a sufi theologian. He was the founder and teacher of the Madrasa Shams-uloom at Fort Sandeman in Zhob.  Shams-ud-din received elementary religious education from his father. He continued both secular schooling and religious education.  He matriculated from a government high school in Zhob in 1960. He then attended a madrassa boarding school in Akora Khattak, Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa. He stayed there for two years and continued his education under the guidance of Abdul Haq (father of Sami-ul-Haq, the chief of the JUI). He then attended the Madrasa Arabia New Town Karachi, where he studied under Muhammad Yousuf Binori for two consecutive years.  He then went to Khanpur, Rahim Yar Khan and studied at the Madrasa Arabia Makhzan-ul-uloom wa fayuz Eidgah, headed by Pakistani religious scholar Abdullah Darkhawasti.  Realizing the highest spiritual position of his teacher, he immediately became his spiritual student by taking the Bay'ah (oath of allegiance) of the Naqshbandi order of Sufism.  After two years stay he proceeded to his last institution, the Madrasa Nasratul Uloom Gujranwala, to complete the remaining one-year course of Darse Nizami. At that madrasa, Shams-ud-din studied course of Hadiths (narrations of the words and deeds of Muhammad). He gained knowledge of tafseer, Hadith, spiritualism, mysticism, metaphysics, and logic. Thus completing a traditional Dars-i-Nizam course, he acquired his sanad (degree in Islamic knowledge and sciences of Hadith).  After completing his graduation he returned to his native city of Zhob, where his father advised him to engage in revitalizing his madrasa. He became the patron of Madrasa, Shams-ul-Uloom following his father's wishes.  Ancestral background  Shams-ud-din belonged to the Harifal tribe. Shams-ud-din's forefather had been religious scholars for many generations. His first cousin, Obaid-ullah Khan Harifal, was the sardar (tribal chieftain) of the Harifal tribe. His grandfather, Muhammad Rafique, was a saint and had many disciples, as did his father. Another grandfather, Abdul Haq Harifal, had resisted British occupation, in present-day Shinghar.  Political career   Shams-ud-din was a member of Tehreek-e-Khatme Nabuwwat, which demanded the government of Pakistan declare Ahmadis as non-Muslims.  During the general election of 1970, Shams-ud-din participated and contested the election at PB 10, Fort Sandeman (as Zhob was then known), on the platform of his political party Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam. He came in first in the election with 7,578 votes, more than double the total of the second-place finisher, Nawabzada Taimur Shah Jogezai, of the Muslim League (Qayyam), who received 3,726 Votes.  On 2 May 1972, chairman Abdul Samad Khan Achakzai opened the first session of the Provincial Assembly of Balochistan, in the town hall, Quetta. During this session, Nawab Muhammad Khan Barozai of the National Awami Party (NAP) was elected as Speaker of Assembly. The very next day, 3 May 1972, Shams-ud-din was unanimously elected Deputy Speaker.   (Ataullah Mengal had already been elected on 1 May as chief Minister.)  It was a coalition government of NAP and JUI. Shams-ud-din was the youngest member of the assembly at age 28. Unfortunately, the assembly only lasted for ten months, before the Federal Government of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto dismissed the Provincial Government of Balochistan on 13 February 1973.  Arrest On 15 July 1973, Shams-ud-din held a rally in Zarif Sheed Park, Zhob. He delivered a speech against the dissemination of tampered Qurans and literature in his native city, allegedly by Ahmadis. Tampering news inflamed the emotions of the people, which lead to riots and lynchings.  Between 17 and 18 July 1973, Shams-ud-din's Zhob residence was cordoned off by a heavy contingent of Frontier Corps, who arrested him. The next morning, news of his arrest spread through the city, and tribesmen from all around blocked the outgoing roads to prevent him from being taken away. As the public protest grew out of control, authorities took him away by helicopter. This only further inflamed unrest all over the country.  Several days after Shams-ud-din's disappearance, Mufti Mehmood demanded on the floor of the National Assembly that his whereabouts be revealed, even if he were dead. On that demand the Interior Minister Abdul Qayyum Khan confessed that Shams-ud-din was alive and in custody at Ma-wand (Kohlu) District, Balochistan. His arrest was controversial throughout the province.  During his detention period, his father Muhammad Zahid Harifal received a message from then Governor Akbar Bugti, through his special emissary Saleh Muhammad, seeking a meeting at Quetta, so that the release of Shams-ud-din  could be worked out. Muhammad Zahid declined to accede to this proposal.  A writ petition of habeas corpus was filed in Sindh-Balochistan High Court, Karachi, challenging his illegal confinement and petitioning for his release, on the premise that the prisoner had been detained incommunicado. Shams-ud-din was released on 18 August 1973. He received a grand reception when he returned to Zhob.  A couple of days after his release, he held a rally in Central Jama Mosque, Zhob, and expressed his determination to go ahead with his mission.  Meanwhile, his two colleagues, Saleh Muhammad Mardanzai of Muslim Bagh and Hassan Shah, who were elected on the JUI ticket, switched over to the ruling Pakistan People's party. Their actions conjured up illusions of victory in the minds of many hawkish politicians, who believed that Shams-ud-din would also switch parties. He was even offered the position of provincial Chief Minister as a reward, but refused.  Death  In the first week of March 1974, Shams-ud-din left Zhob for Quetta, and along with Muhammad Zaman Khan Achakzai (Provincial General Secretary of the JUI) called on the governor of Balochistan, Khan of Kalat Mir Ahmed Yar Khan, and conveyed him the message of Darkhawasti, and reminded him his commitment for implementing Islamic laws. The governor replied positively, stating, ""we seek your cooperation"".  After his meeting with the governor, Shams-ud-din left Quetta for Khanpur, where he met with his mentor Darkhawasti, who prediction to Shams-ud-din, ""it could be our last meeting"". A few days prior, an attempt had been made on Darkhawasti's life at his official residence in Quetta and Darkhawasti was concerned.  On 10 March 1974,  Shams-ud-din addressed his last gathering near the vegetable market in Rahimyarkhan, Punjab Pakistan. Later that same day he left for Sibi and stayed overnight.   On 13 March 1974, Shams-ud-din was driving home to Zhob along with one of his friends. On the way to Zhob, Shams-ud-din stopped in Akhterzai for his noon prayers. After prayers were over, Shams-ud-din resumed the drive. Thirty-five kilometers from Akhterzai, near a village called ""Khulgai"" (Killa Saifullah District), where his friend shot him thrice in the head from behind the driver's seat.  Later that same day, Malik Gul Hassan, who also happened to be on way to Zhob, saw an abandoned car on the side of the road and went to investigate. He found the body of Maulana Shams-ud-din, and the whole interior of car stained with blood. He turned back to Killa Saifullah and informed police and district authorities. It was learnt later that Shams-ud-din's friend had visited him at Quetta and stayed with him for three days before insisting on accompanying him to Zhob.  Aftermath The next day, people took to the streets in Quetta, chanting slogans against his assassination. At Bacha Khan crossroads, police clashed with demonstrators, opening fire on the crowd, killing six and injuring more than one hundred people; however, the unrest didn't subside. His funeral prayer became a massive demonstration of popular acclaim.   The next day, 14 March 1974, he was laid to rest at Zhob graveyard. At 29 years old, Shams-ud-din was survived by his widow and a daughter, his parents, and his brothers.  Legacy Shams-ud-din's death created such a wave of sympathy that it left political repercussions in the province. North Balochistan is the current political heartland of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam, who control  not only large numbers of radical Madrassas, but a majority of the legislative seats at both the national and provincial level.  A main crossroads in Zhob was renamed ""Maulana Shams-ud-din Shaheed Chowk"" in 2012 by the people of Zhob.  Numerous legends and popular songs have grown around his personality. People still believe that on his burial there was a shower of petals, and his blood continued to ooze from his body 24 hours after his body, with a fragrant smell.

W.A.K.O. World Championships 2005 (Agadir),"W.A.K.O. World Championships 2005 in Agadir were the joint fifteenth world championships held by the W.A.K.O. organization and the first ever to be held in Morocco and the continent of Africa - with the other event to be held later that year in Szeged, Hungary.  The championships were open to amateur men and women from across the world, with about roughly 48 countries providing around 350 athletes (although some would be denied Visas), who all attended despite initial fears about potential terrorist attacks.  There were three styles on offer at Agadir; Low-Kick, Thai-Boxing and Musical Forms.  The other usual styles (Full/Semi/Light-Contact kickboxing) would be held at the event in Szeged.  By the end of the championships regular winners Russia were once again the top nation across all styles, with hosts Morocco doing well in second thanks largely to a great performance in Thai-Boxing, with Belarus way behind in third.  The event was held over seven days at the Palais des Sports in Agadir, Morocco, starting on Monday, 19 September and ending Sunday, 25 September 2005 and was watched by around 10,000 spectators.  Low-Kick  Low-Kick is a form of kickboxing where punches and kicks can be thrown at an opponent with full force at legal targets.  It is similar to Full-Contact kickboxing only that kicks are also allowed to be made to the opponent's lower legs and thighs.  Most fights are won by point's decision victory or via a referee stoppage and as with most forms of amateur kickboxing, suitable head and body protection must be worn.  More information on Low-Kick can be found on the official W.A.K.O. website.  Both men and women had competitions at Agadir, with the men having twelve weight divisions ranging from 51 kg/112.2 lbs to over 91 kg/+200.2 lbs and the women having seven ranging from 48 kg/105.6 lbs to over 70 kg/+143 lbs.  The most notable winner was future K-1 regional and pro world champion Łukasz Jarosz who had also won gold at the last European championships in Budva, while future pro world champions Eduard Mammadov and Michał Głogowski gained podium finishes.  Other gold medallists who had also won at Budva included Dmitry Ayzyatulov (Full-Contact), Ruslan Tozliyan, Artur Tozliyan, Dmitri Krasichkov and Dejan Milosavljevic.  Russia were easily the strongest country in the style with ten gold, four silver and four bronze across the male and female competitions.  Men's Low-Kick Kickboxing Medals Table  Women's Low-Kick Kickboxing Medals Table  Thai-Boxing  Thai-Boxing, more commonly known as Muay Thai, is a type of kickboxing that allows the participants to throw punches, kicks, elbows and knees at full force to legal targets on the opponents body.  Due to the physical nature of the sport, stoppages are not uncommon, although in amateur Thai-Boxing head and body protection must be worn.  At Agadir both men and women took part in the style with the men having twelve weight divisions ranging from 51 kg/112.2 lbs to over 91 kg/+200.2 lbs and the women six, ranging from 52 kg/114.4 lbs to over 70 kg/154 lbs.  There were a number of notable faces amongst the medal positions with fighters such as Faldir Chahbari, L'houcine Ouzgni and Sergei Gur all winning medals.  Also of note was Djamal Kasumov who moved up in weight to add to the gold medal he had won at the last European championships in Budva.  The host nation Morocco were easily the strongest country in Thai-Boxing, winning ten gold, three silver and three bronze medals across the male and female competitions.  Regular winners Belarus did very poorly by her standards only picking up one gold as well as a smattering of silver and bronze medals.  Men's Thai-Boxing Medals Table  Women's Thai-Boxing Medals Table  Musical Forms  Musical Forms is a type of non-physical competition which sees the contestants fighting against imaginary foes using Martial Arts techniques - more information on the style can be found on the W.A.K.O. website.

List of Paul McCartney concert tours,"English musician Paul McCartney has participated in a number of concert tours across several eras of his musical career. With the British–American rock band Wings, he undertook five major tours, with one, the Wings Over the World tour, being worldwide. Following Wings' final 1979 tour of the UK, McCartney did not undergo a major concert tour for ten years. As a solo artist, McCartney has undergone sixteen major concert tours, nine being worldwide. His first was The Paul McCartney World Tour (1989–90) and his most recent being the 2018–20 Freshen Up tour.  With Wings  The British–American rock band Wings was Paul McCartney's post-Beatles band who were active from 1971 to 1981. Their primary line-up was McCartney, his wife Linda and guitarist Denny Laine, formerly of the Moody Blues. Throughout their years as a band, they embarked on a number of concert tours, varying in scale from their initial ""DIY"" tour of British universities to the epic Wings Over the World tour.  Shortly after forming Wings, the McCartneys took the band on an impromptu tour of the United Kingdom's universities in early 1972, showing up unannounced and performing for whoever happened to be on campus. The band's intended first stop on the tour, Ashby-de-la-Zouch, refused to allow them to play, so the band moved on to the more receptive University of Nottingham. Admission to the first show was £0.50, proceeds being split up equally among the band members.  The last Concert for the People of Kampuchea on 29 December 1979, which was the final date of Wings' fifth tour, was Wings' final gig.    However, Wings achieved notoriety for its aborted sixth tour, a January 1980 tour of Japan, which was cancelled before it even started when Paul McCartney was arrested for possession of marijuana while entering Japan on 16 January 1980 and was eventually deported on 25 January after nine days in prison, without Wings ever performing.  Wings never again attempted a tour prior to their breakup in 1981.

The Runaway Skyscraper,"""The Runaway Skyscraper"" is a science fiction short story by American writer Murray Leinster, first appeared in the February 22, 1919 issue of Argosy magazine.  Although Leinster had been appearing regularly in The Smart Set and pulp magazines such as Argosy and Short Stories for three years, ""The Runaway Skyscraper"" was his first published science fiction story (or more accurately, scientific romance, since Hugo Gernsback had yet to coin the phrase ""science fiction"").  Gernsback would reprint the story in the third issue of his science fiction pulp magazine Amazing Stories in June 1926.  Plot summary ""The Runaway Skyscraper"" concerns Arthur Chamberlain, an engineer who works in a midtown Manhattan office building called the Metropolitan Tower.  When the sun suddenly begins moving backwards in the sky, setting rapidly in the east, he is the only one to realize what is actually happening: a flaw in the rock beneath the building has caused it to subside, but instead of moving in space, the building is falling backwards into the past.  When the subsidence finally ends, the building is located several thousand years in the past, and its 2000-odd inhabitants find themselves stranded in pre-Columbian Manhattan.  Chamberlain also realizes that the same seismic forces that caused the building to drop back into the past can also be used to return it to the present, but that doing so will require several weeks of intensive work by the building's inhabitants, and in the meantime they must concentrate on feeding themselves.  Chamberlain convinces the president of a bank on the first floor that he can return them to the present, and together they are able to organize the other inhabitants into hunting and fishing parties.  Two weeks later, Chamberlain is ready to implement his plan.  He forces a jet of soapy water into an artesian well beneath the building, and this allows the pressure that has built up in the rock to be released.

Air-gap flash,"An air-gap flash is a photographic light source capable of producing sub-microsecond light flashes, allowing for (ultra) high-speed photography. This is achieved by a high-voltage (20 kV typically) electric discharge between two electrodes over the surface of a quartz (or glass) tube. The distance between the electrodes is such that a spontaneous discharge does not occur. To start the discharge a high-voltage pulse (70 kV for example) is applied on an electrode inside the quartz tube.  The flash can be triggered electronically by being synchronised with an electronic detection device such as a microphone or an interrupted laser beam in order to illuminate a fast event. A sub-microsecond flash is fast enough to photographically capture a supersonic bullet in flight without noticeable motion blur.  History The person credited with popularising the flash is Harold Eugene Edgerton, though the  earlier scientist Ernst Mach also used a spark gap as a fast photographic lighting system.  William Henry Fox Talbot is said to have created the first spark-based flash photo, using a Leyden jar, the original form of the capacitor. Edgerton was one of the founders of EG&G company who sold an air-gap flash under the name Microflash 549. There are several commercial flashes available today.  Design parameters   The aim of a high-speed flash is to be very fast and yet bright enough for adequate exposure. An air-gap flash system typically consists of a capacitor that is discharged through a gas (air in this case). The speed of a flash is mainly determined by the time it takes to discharge the capacitor through the gas. This time is proportional to  ,  in which L is the inductance and C the capacitance of the system. To be fast, both L and C must be kept small.  The brightness of the flash is proportional to the energy stored in the capacitor:  ,  where V is the voltage across the capacitor. This shows that high brightness calls for a large capacitance and a high voltage. However, since a large capacitance would have a relatively long discharge time that would make the flash slow, the only practical solution is to use a very high voltage on a relatively small capacitor, with a very low inductance. Typical values are 0.05 µF capacitance, 0.02 µH inductance, 10 J energy, 0.5 µs duration and about 20 MW power.  Air (mainly nitrogen) is preferred as a gas because it is fast. Xenon has a much higher efficiency in turning energy into light, but is limited in speed to about 10 microseconds, caused by its own afterglow.  The spark is guided over a quartz surface to improve the light output and benefit from the cooling capacity, making the flash faster. This has a negative effect in the form of quartz erosion because of high energy discharge.  Spectral properties   Since the spark gap discharges in air generating a plasma, the spectrum shows both a continuum and spectral lines, mainly of nitrogen since air is 79% nitrogen. The spectrum is rich in UV but covers the entire visible range down to infra-red. When a quartz tube is used as ignition tube, it shows a clear phosphorescence in blue after the flash, induced by the UV.

Edeowie,"Edeowie may refer to:  Edeowie, South Australia, a ghost town Edeowie glass, a natural glass found in South Australia Edeowie  Station, a pastoral lease in South Australia Hundred of Edeowie, a cadastral unit in South Australia","The name of the town is derived from its founder, Edeochukwu Iheagwara Ojukwu (1845–1928), who was born in 1845 and died on 28 May 1928 at age 73. Edeowoie has been described as ""the most important Igbo town"" by historian Chinwe Nwagbara because it served as the capital city during the reigns of four kings between 1901 to 1927; these were Eze Agwunaike II, Eze Okeke III, Eze Onyekpere IV and Eze Ukwu V.  The first king after Edeochukwu's death was his son-in-law, Prince Uche Obasi Ugboaja, also known as King Agwunaike II.   He ruled until 1917 when he abdicated in favour of his eldest daughter, Princess Ezinne Agwaja.    She reigned under her father's title until 1926 before she too handed over power to her brother, Prince Chukwemeka Ugboaja aka King Okeke III.   In 1929, King Okeke III appointed his younger sister Queen Amaka Ugboaja as regent while he went into exile following the British invasion of Nigeria that year.   During this time period, there are conflicting accounts about whether or not Queen Amaka actually held any official position within the kingdom.   Some sources say she did hold such positions but others state that she never officially took up office.

Pearl gourami,"The pearl gourami (Trichopodus leerii) is a species of gourami native to Southeast Asia.  Description These fish reach about  TL. The body is a brownish-silver colour, covered in a pearl-like pattern with a distinct black line running from the fish's head, and gradually thinning towards the caudal fin. This fish's appearance has given rise to many popular names, such as the lace gourami and the mosaic gourami.  Male specimens of this fish, typical of many gouramis, are generally larger and more colourful than their female counterparts. They exhibit bright orange colouring around the throat region, which at breeding time becomes much brighter and is used to court the female. Males also exhibit somewhat of an orange tinge in their fins, with the exception of the caudal (tail) fin. The male also has longer fins, with a more pointed dorsal fin and extended anal fin rays.  Distribution and habitat The pearl gourami is native to Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia (where it is found on the islands of Sumatra, and Borneo). It occurs in lowland swamps with acidic water. This fish prefers the top and middle levels of the water.  Species description and name Trichopodus leerii was formally described as Trichopus leerii by the Dutch medical doctor and ichthyologist Pieter Bleeker in 1852. The type was collected at Palembang in Sumatra by Lieutenant-Colonel J. M. van Leer who was a medical colleague of Bleeker's and whom Bleeker honoured in its specific name.  In the aquarium  Tank requirements A tank with a volume of 120 litres (30 gallons) or over is generally recommended for a pair of pearl gouramis, although anything above that volume is greatly recommended, since these fish may show signs of stress, abnormal aggression, and illness when confined. Preferred tank temperatures are 22–28°C (72–82F). Tanks with surfaces exposed to fresh, humid air are needed so that the pearl gourami's labyrinth organ can function correctly. As with any tropical aquarium, adequate filtration, lighting, substrate and decorations, plants, and other parts of proper care are required. This fish may be somewhat timid or shy, and should not be kept with fish that are too boisterous or aggressive. In fact, in the first several days or weeks, these fish typically show extreme shyness and timidness, spending a great deal of time hiding, regardless of tank-mates or water properties. If in proper conditions, however, they will outgrow this and become more gregarious, becoming social fish. Although somewhat hardy, pearl gouramis can be vulnerable to disease, so clean water is a must. Many gouramis display bolder behavior when the tank is furnished with plants, decorations, and ornaments which provide safe refuges for the fish in times of stress.  Breeding The pearl gourami is a bubble nest builder that uses plants to help bind together the bubbles. The water level should be reduced to 20 cm (8 in) during spawning  , and the temperature should be approximately 28 °C (82 °F) and with a pH of around 7. After spawning both adults cannot be kept together. The eggs hatch after two days and the fry become free swimming three days later (Ter Morshuizen 2007). When they commence with swimming freely the fry can be fed infusoria and brine shrimp, and a week later finely ground flakes. Freeze-dried tablets may also be fed to older fry. The temperature needs to be high (about 84 °F) and with little or no water movement. Since they are air breathers, filtration is not necessary.  The pearl gourami has a very unusual and beautiful mating dance. The male builds a nest of tiny, durable bubbles. The female takes a position under the nest and the male curves his body tightly around her, from underneath. Her body quivers while she expels a few eggs. Next he releases her and picks up the eggs in his mouth as they are sinking, then he spits them into the bubble nest. This sequence is repeated several times, until the female has laid all of her eggs.  The fry are tiny at hatching (.2 mm or smaller). The male cares for the fry, taking them into his mouth and spitting them back into the nest if they fall out. Some tend to grow faster than others, and will exhibit fratricide, eating their smaller siblings.

Bessarabia,"Bessarabia (; ; ; , Bessarabiya; ; , Bessarabiya; , Besarabiya) is a historical region in Eastern Europe, bounded by the Dniester river on the east and the Prut river on the west. About two thirds of Bessarabia lies within modern-day Moldova, with the Ukrainian Budjak region covering the southern coastal region and part of the Ukrainian Chernivtsi Oblast covering a small area in the north.  In the aftermath of the Russo-Turkish War (1806–1812), and the ensuing Peace of Bucharest, the eastern parts of the Principality of Moldavia, an Ottoman vassal, along with some areas formerly under direct Ottoman rule, were ceded to Imperial Russia. The acquisition was among the Empire's last territorial acquisitions in Europe. The newly acquired territories were organised as the Bessarabia Governorate of the Russian Empire, adopting a name previously used for the southern plains between the Dniester and the Danube rivers. Following the Crimean War, in 1856, the southern areas of Bessarabia were returned to Moldavian rule; Russian rule was restored over the whole of the region in 1878, when Romania, the result of Moldavia's union with Wallachia, was pressured into exchanging those territories for the Dobruja.  In 1917, in the wake of the Russian Revolution, the area constituted itself as the Moldavian Democratic Republic, an autonomous republic part of a proposed federative Russian state. Bolshevik agitation in late 1917 and early 1918 resulted in the intervention of the Romanian Army, ostensibly to pacify the region. Soon after, the parliamentary assembly declared independence, and then union with the Kingdom of Romania. However, the legality of these acts was disputed, most prominently by the Soviet Union, which regarded the area as a territory occupied by Romania.  In 1940, after securing the assent of Nazi Germany through the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, the Soviet Union pressured Romania, under threat of war, into withdrawing from Bessarabia, allowing the Red Army to enter and the Soviet Union to annex the region. The area was formally integrated into the Soviet Union: the core joined parts of the Moldavian ASSR to form the Moldavian SSR, while territories inhabited by Slavic majorities in the north and the south of Bessarabia were transferred to the Ukrainian SSR. Axis-aligned Romania recaptured the region in 1941 with the success of Operation München during the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, but lost it in 1944 as the tide of war turned. In 1947, the Soviet-Romanian border along the Prut was internationally recognised by the Paris Treaty that ended World War II.  During the process of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Moldavian and Ukrainian SSRs proclaimed their independence in 1991, becoming the modern states of Moldova and Ukraine while preserving the existing partition of Bessarabia. Following a short war in the early 1990s, the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic was proclaimed in the Transnistria, extending its authority also over the municipality of Bender on the right bank of Dniester river. Part of the Gagauz-inhabited areas in southern Bessarabia was organised in 1994 as an autonomous region within Moldova.  Etymology and usage of the name   According to the traditional explanation, the name Bessarabia (Basarabia in Romanian) derives from the Wallachian Basarab dynasty, who allegedly ruled over the southern part of the area in the 14th century. However, some scholars question this, claiming that:  the name was initially an exonym applied by Western cartographers  it was first used in local sources only in the late 17th century;  the idea that it referred to Moldavian regions near the Black Sea was explicitly rejected as a cartographic confusion by the early Moldavian chronicler Miron Costin, and;  the confusion may have been caused by medieval Western cartographers, misinterpreting contemporaneous Polish references to Wallachia as Bessarabia as referring to a separate land between Wallachia and Moldavia.  According to Dimitrie Cantemir, the name Bessarabia originally applied only to the part of the territory south of the Upper Trajanic Wall, i.e. an area only slightly bigger than present-day Budjak.  Geography  The region is bounded by the Dniester to the north and east, the Prut to the west, and the lower River Danube and Black Sea to the south. It has an area of . The area is mostly hilly plains and flat steppes. It is very fertile and has lignite deposits and stone quarries. People living in the area grow sugar beet, sunflower, wheat, maize, tobacco, wine grapes, and fruit. They raise sheep and cattle. The main industry in the region is agricultural processing.  The main cities are Chișinău (former capital of the Russian Bessarabia Governorate, now capital of Moldova), and Izmail and Bilhorod-Dnistrovs'kyi (historically called Cetatea Albă and Akkerman; both now within Ukraine). Other towns of administrative or historical importance include: Khotyn, Reni, and Kilia (all now in Ukraine); and Lipcani, Briceni, Soroca, Bălți, Orhei, Ungheni, Bender/Tighina, and Cahul (all now in Moldova).  History   In the late 14th century, the newly established Principality of Moldavia encompassed what later became known as Bessarabia. Afterward, this territory was directly or indirectly, partly or wholly controlled by: the Ottoman Empire (as suzerain of Moldavia, with direct rule only in Budjak and Khotyn), Russian Empire, Romania, the USSR. Since 1991, most of the territory forms the core of Moldova, with smaller parts in Ukraine.  Prehistory   People have inhabited the territory of Bessarabia for thousands of years. Cucuteni–Trypillia culture flourished between the 6th and 3rd millennium BC.  Ancient times   In Antiquity the region was inhabited by Thracians, as well as for shorter periods by Cimmerians, Scythians, Sarmatians, and Celts, specifically by tribes such as the Costoboci, Carpi, Britogali, Tyragetae, and Bastarnae. In the 6th century BC, Greek settlers established the colony of Tyras along the Black Sea coast and traded with the locals. Celts also settled in the southern parts of Bessarabia, their main city being Aliobrix.  The first polity that is believed to have included the whole of Bessarabia was the Dacian polity of Burebista in the 1st century BC. After his death, the polity was divided into smaller pieces, and the central parts were unified in the Dacian kingdom of Decebalus in the 1st century AD. This kingdom was defeated by the Roman Empire in 106. Southern Bessarabia was included in the empire even before that, in 57 AD, as part of the Roman province Moesia Inferior, but it was secured only when the Dacian Kingdom was defeated in 106. The Romans built defensive earthen walls in Southern Bessarabia (e.g. Lower Trajan Wall) to defend the Scythia Minor province against invasions. Except for the Black Sea shore in the south, Bessarabia remained outside direct Roman control; the myriad of tribes there are called by modern historians Free Dacians. The 2nd to the 5th centuries also saw the development of the Chernyakhov culture.  In 270, the Roman authorities began to withdraw their forces south of the Danube, especially from the Roman Dacia, due to the invading Goths and Carpi. The Goths, a Germanic tribe, poured into the Roman Empire from the lower Dniepr River, through the southern part of Bessarabia (Budjak steppe), which due to its geographic position and characteristics (mainly steppe), was swept by various nomadic tribes for many centuries. In 378, the area was overrun by the Huns.  Early Middle Ages   From the 3rd century until the 11th century, the region was invaded numerous times in turn by different tribes: Goths, Huns, Avars, Bulgars, Magyars, Pechenegs, Cumans and Mongols. The territory of Bessarabia was encompassed in dozens of ephemeral kingdoms which were disbanded when another wave of migrants arrived. Those centuries were characterized by a terrible state of insecurity and mass movement of these tribes. The period was later known as the ""Dark Ages"" of Europe, or Age of migrations.  In 561, the Avars captured Bessarabia and executed the local ruler Mesamer. Following the Avars, Slavs arrived in the region and established settlements. Then, in 582, Onogur Bulgars settled in southeastern Bessarabia and northern Dobruja, from which they moved to Moesia Inferior (allegedly under pressure from the Khazars), and formed the nascent region of Bulgaria. With the rise of the Khazars' state in the east, the invasions began to diminish and it was possible to create larger states. According to some opinions, the southern part of Bessarabia remained under the influence of the First Bulgarian Empire until the end of the 9th century.  Between the 8th and 10th centuries, the southern part of Bessarabia was inhabited by people from the Balkan-Danubian culture (the culture of the First Bulgarian Empire). Between the 9th and 13th centuries, Bessarabia is mentioned in Slav chronicles as part of Bolohoveni (north) and Brodnici (south) voivodeships, believed to be Vlach principalities of the early Middle Ages.  The last large-scale invasions were those of the Mongols of 1241, 1290, and 1343. Sehr al-Jedid (near Orhei), an important settlement of the Golden Horde, dates from this period. They led to a retreat of a big part of the population to the mountainous areas in Eastern Carpathians and to Transylvania. The population east of Prut became especially low at the time of the Tatar invasions.  In the Late Middle Age, chronicles mention a Tigheci ""republic"", predating the establishment of the Principality of Moldavia, situated near the modern town of Cahul in the southwest of Bessarabia, preserving its autonomy even during the later Principality even into the 18th century. Genovese merchants rebuilt or established a number of forts along Dniester (notably Moncastro) and Danube (including Kyliya/Chilia-Licostomo).  Principality of Moldavia   After the 1360s the region was gradually included in the principality of Moldavia, which by 1392 established control over the fortresses of Akkerman and Chilia, its eastern border becoming the River Dniester. Based on the name of the region, some authors consider that in the latter part of the 14th century the southern part of the region was under the rule of Wallachia (the ruling dynasty of Wallachia during that period was called Basarab). In the 15th century, the entire region was a part of the principality of Moldavia. Stephen the Great ruled between 1457 and 1504, a period of nearly 50 years during which he won 32 battles defending his country against virtually all his neighbours (mainly the Ottomans and the Tatars, but also the Hungarians and the Poles) while losing only two. During this period, after each victory, he raised a monastery or a church close to the battlefield honoring Christianity. Many of these battlefields and churches, as well as old fortresses, are situated in Bessarabia (mainly along Dniester).  In 1484, the Turks invaded and captured Chilia and Cetatea Albă (Akkerman in Turkish), and annexed the shoreline southern part of Bessarabia, which was then divided into two sanjaks (districts) of the Ottoman Empire. In 1538, the Ottomans annexed more Bessarabian land in the south as far as Tighina, while the central and northern Bessarabia remained part of the Principality of Moldavia (which became a vassal of the Ottoman Empire). Between 1711 and 1812, the Russian Empire occupied the region five times during its wars against Ottoman and Austrian Empires.  Annexation by the Russian Empire   By the Treaty of Bucharest of May 28, 1812—concluding the Russo-Turkish War, 1806-1812—the Ottoman Empire ceded the land between the Pruth and the Dniester, including both Moldavian and Turkish territories, to the Russian Empire. That entire region was then called Bessarabia.  In 1814, the first German settlers arrived and mainly settled in the southern parts, and Bessarabian Bulgarians began settling in the region too, founding towns such as Bolhrad. Between 1812 and 1846, the Bulgarian and Gagauz population migrated to the Russian Empire via the River Danube, after living many years under oppressive Ottoman rule, and settled in southern Bessarabia. Turkic-speaking tribes of the Nogai horde also inhabited the Budjak Region (in Turkish Bucak) of southern Bessarabia from the 16th to 18th centuries but were totally driven out prior to 1812.  Administratively, Bessarabia became an oblast of the Russian Empire in 1818, and a guberniya in 1873.  By the Treaty of Adrianople that concluded the Russo-Turkish War of 1828-1829 the entire Danube Delta was added to the Bessarabian oblast. According to Vasile Stoica, emissary of the Romanian government to the United States, in 1834, the Romanian language was banned from schools and government facilities, despite 80% of the population speaking the language. This would eventually lead to the banning of Romanian in churches, media, and books. According to the same author, those who protested the banning of Romanian could be sent to Siberia.  Southern Bessarabia returned to Moldavia At the end of the Crimean War, in 1856, by the Treaty of Paris, Southern Bessarabia (organised as the Cahul and Ismail counties, with the Bolgrad county split from the latter in 1864) was returned to Moldavia, causing the Russian Empire to lose access to the Danube river.  In 1859, Moldavia and Wallachia united to form the Romanian United Principalities (Romania), which included the southern part of Bessarabia.  The railway Chișinău-Iași was opened on June 1, 1875, in preparation for the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878) and the Eiffel Bridge was opened on , just three days before the outbreak of the war. The Romanian War of Independence was fought in 1877–78, with the help of the Russian Empire as an ally. Northern Dobruja was awarded to Romania for its role in the 1877–78 Russo-Turkish War, and as compensation for the transfer of Southern Bessarabia.  Early 20th century  The Kishinev pogrom took place in the capital of Bessarabia on April 6, 1903, after local newspapers published articles inciting the public to act against Jews; 47 or 49 Jews were killed, 92 severely wounded and 700 houses destroyed. The anti-Semitic newspaper Бессарабец (Bessarabetz, meaning ""Bessarabian""), published by Pavel Krushevan, insinuated that local Jews killed a Russian boy. Another newspaper, Свет (Lat. Svet, meaning ""World"" or Russian for ""Light""), used the age-old blood libel against the Jews (alleging that the boy had been killed to use his blood in preparation of matzos).  After the 1905 Russian Revolution, a Romanian nationalist movement started to develop in Bessarabia. In the chaos brought by the Russian revolution of October 1917, a National Council (Sfatul Țării) was established in Bessarabia, with 120 members elected from Bessarabia by some political and professional organizations and 10 elected from Transnistria (the left bank of Dniester where Moldovans and Romanians accounted for less than a third and the majority of the population was Ukrainian. See Demographics of Transdniestria).  The Rumcherod Committee (Central Executive Committee of the Soviets of Romanian Front, Black Sea Fleet and Odessa Military District) proclaimed itself the supreme power in Bessarabia.  On the pretext of securing supply lines against raids by Bolsheviks and armed bandits, members of the Moldavian legislative council Sfatul Țării and the Entente Powers requested military assistance from Romania, and the Romanian Army crossed the republic's border on ; following several skirmishes with Moldovan and Bolshevik troops, the occupation of the whole region was completed in early March. The occupation of Bessarabia by the Romanians was not universally welcomed, and the members of the Bessarabian government denied that the Romanian troops had ever been invited to occupy the republic.  After Ukraine issued its Fourth Universal, breaking ties with Bolshevik Russia and proclaiming a sovereign Ukrainian state, Sfatul Țării declared Bessarabia's independence on January 24, 1918, as the Moldavian Democratic Republic.  Unification with Romania   On March 5 [O.S. 20 February] 1918, in a secret agreement signed along the Treaty of Buftea, the German Empire allowed Romania to annex Bessarabia in exchange for free passage of German troops toward Ukraine. The county councils of Bălți, Soroca and Orhei were the earliest to ask for unification of the Moldavian Democratic Republic with the Kingdom of Romania, and on April 9 [O.S. March 27] 1918, in the presence of the Romanian Army, The Country Council, called ""Sfatul Țării"", voted in favour of the union, with the following conditions:   The Country Council would undertake an agrarian reform, which the Romanian Government would accept.  Bessarabia would remain autonomous, with its own diet, the Country Council, elected democratically  The Country Council would vote for local budgets, control the councils of the zemstva and cities, and appoint the local administration  Conscription would be done on a territorial basis  Local laws and the form of administration could be changed only with the approval of local representatives  The rights of minorities had to be respected  Two Bessarabian representatives would be part of the Romanian government  Bessarabia would send to the Romanian Parliament a number of representatives equal to the proportion of its population  All elections must involve a direct, equal, secret, and universal vote  Freedom of speech and of belief must be guaranteed in the constitution  All individuals who had committed felonies for political reasons during the revolution would be amnestied.  86 deputies voted in support, three voted against and 36 abstained. The Romanian prime minister at the time, Alexandru Marghiloman, would later admit that the union was decided in Bucharest and Iași, the seats of the Romanian government.  The first condition, the agrarian reform, was debated and approved in November 1918. The Country Council also decided to remove the other conditions and made unification with Romania unconditional. The legality of this vote was considered highly debatable since the meeting had not been publicly announced, there was no quorum (only 44 of the 125 members took part in it, mostly Moldavian conservatives), and then the Country Council voted for its self-dissolution, preventing the protests of the Moldavians and minorities members who had not participated in the parliamentary session from being taken into account.  In the autumn of 1919, elections for the Romanian Constituent Assembly were held in Bessarabia; 90 deputies and 35 senators were chosen. On December 20, 1919, these men voted, along with the representatives of Romania's other regions, to ratify the unification acts that had been approved by the Country Council and the National Congresses in Transylvania and Bukovina.  The union was recognized by France, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Japan in the Treaty of Paris of 1920. However, the treaty never came into force, as Japan did not ratify it. The United States refused to sign the treaty on the grounds that Russia was not represented at the Conference. The US also considered Bessarabia a territory under Romanian occupation, rather than Romanian territory, despite existing political and economic relations between the US and Romania. Soviet Russia (and later, the USSR) did not recognize the union, and by 1924, after its demands for a regional plebiscite were declined by Romania for the second time, declared Bessarabia to be Soviet territory under foreign occupation. On all Soviet maps, Bessarabia was highlighted as territory not belonging to Romania.  Aftermath A Provisional Workers' & Peasants' Government of Bessarabia was founded on May 5, 1919, in exile at Odessa, by the Bolsheviks.  On May 11, 1919, the Bessarabian Soviet Socialist Republic was proclaimed as an autonomous part of Russian SFSR, but was abolished by the military forces of Poland and France in September 1919 (see Polish–Soviet War). After the victory of Bolshevist Russia in the Russian Civil War, the Ukrainian SSR was created in 1922, and in 1924 the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was established on a strip of Ukrainian land on the west bank of Dniester where Moldovans and Romanians accounted for less than a third and the relative majority of the population was Ukrainian. (See Demographics of the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic).  Part of Romania  Historiography Svetlana Suveică considers that historical discourse regarding interwar Bessarabia was heavily influenced by the political association of the authors, and sought mainly to argue for or against the legality of Romanian rule in Bessarabia. The impact of the various reforms on the progress of the province was mostly ignored.  Romanian historiography, for the most part, consistently sought to demonstrate the legitimacy of the regime established after the Union of Bessarabia with Romania. During the interwar period, Romanian historians countered Soviet historians' description of it as the establishment of an ""occupation regime"". The agrarian reform, considered one of the most radical in Europe (an idea also supported by Western historians), was appreciated as having a positive role, emphasizing the national emancipation of the Romanian peasantry, while the modernization of agriculture was presented as a complex phenomenon, which also required further mechanism to support the new owner. However, agriculture was ignored by the state, and the new owners were greatly affected by the lack of credit, Romanian authors of the time suggested various ways this situation could have been overcome. Ultimately, as the state failed to create an adequate agricultural policy, by the end of the 1920 authors were hoping progress could be made through private initiative. Romanian authors also paid particular attention to the unification of administrative legislation, norms, and principles of administrative law, as well as their application in Romanian practice. The institute of the zemstvo was regarded by some of them as the most democratic form of government, and its dissolution by the Romanian authorities was deplored; authors such as Onisifor Ghibu expressed a critical view on the relation between Romanian administrative personnel from outside Bessarabia and the locals, as well as the general structure of the administrative corps.  During the Communist period, Romanian historians initially treated the reforms applied after World War I mainly from social class perspectives. Starting with the 1960s, the first studies that mentioned the existence of a ""Bessarabian historical problem"" appeared. From the second half of the 1970s, studies on the agrarian reform considered that while this led to a ""natural and rational distribution of agricultural property"", it also led to fragmentation of agricultural land. This made the practice of intensive agriculture difficult, since peasants had reduced opportunity to purchase agricultural equipment. Towards the end of the Communist period, the two interwar concepts of development and modernization were re-embraced.  After the fall of Communism, Romanian historiography treated Bessarabia mainly in the context of Romanian nation-building, seen as the main issue affecting Greater Romania; authors focused mainly on issues related to the general and specific context of Bessarabia after the Union, the state's efforts for social-political and economic integration, and cultural development of Bessarabia. The internal and external factors that determined the specifics of the province's integration into the Romanian common framework are also of interest. Romanian authors mainly blamed the lasting effects of Russian domination and the destabilizing role of Soviet Russia (USSR) for the malfunctioning of the Romanian administration, with some also pointing to the difficult and non-uniform character of the integration generated by the non-uniform character of the development of the provinces until 1918, of a different degree of their adaptability to the new conditions. The modernization interwar period is also seen as the third phase of a continuous process, begun in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and brutally interrupted by the establishment of Communism. In this context, some authors consider the comparative studies of the interwar and post-Communist periods in different fields as particularly current.  Soviet historiography considered the changes that took place in interwar Bessarabia expressed were directed either towards strengthening the political, economical, and social position of the bourgeoisie, to the detriment of the peasantry, or towards creating a favourable position for the Romanian population, to the detriment of the national minorities; Soviet authors thus reportedly rejected the notion that any modernization and progress took place in the region during Romanian rule. The transformations that took place on different levels of the Bessarabian society at that time were treated from a social class and/or ethnopolitical positions; Svetlana Suveică states ""the writings from the Soviet period, directly determined by the interference of politics in historical science, alternated the ideas regarding the ""Moldovan"" nation and the national identity, with severe condemnations of the Romanian interwar period"". In Suveică's opinion, the conception of Soviet historiography was based on distorted facts that would serve as ""indisputable arguments"" for the establishment of an illegal ""occupation"" regime. According to Wim P. van Meurs ""the legitimation of the political regime has been the main function of (the Soviet) historiography and such a legitimation has usually been based on a number of historical myths"". The discussion of the social-economic and politico-administrative situation in the region was also closely related to the Romanian-Soviet conflictual relations of the 1960s and 1970s, during which both communist countries treated the Bessarabian problem for political purposes.  The presence of the ideological factor in writing the history of Bessarabia was manifested itself not only at the central level, but also at the level of the historiography of Soviet Moldavia. It was not until the second half of the '80s that the Moldovan historiography raised the issue of the Soviet political and ideological pressures.  After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Moldovan historiography, largely marked by the public identity discourse, deals with the problems of the interwar Bessarabian history, depending on the context. On the one hand, the supporters of the idea of Moldovan statehood reject the option of modernization and progress of Bessarabia after the Union with Romania while, on the other hand, the historians who, starting from the idea of the Romanian character of Bessarabia, and using new sources, ""contribute to the in-depth knowledge of the integrating and modernizing processes that marked the history of the (Bessarabian) land in the interwar period"". This ongoing controversy highlights the two antagonistic geopolitical tendencies present in the contemporary Moldovan historiography: the pro-East current versus the pro-West current.  The Western historiography pointed out that the reforms at the beginning of Romania's rule were mainly directed at easing the social tensions existing across Easter Europe and were, therefore, similar to the ones taking place elsewhere in the region. In the case of the agrarian reform, G. Clenton Logio states that the Romanians were pressed into legislating it, as expropriation had begun before the Union and there was the danger that Bessarabians would undo this act; he notes that no planning took place regarding the effects of the reform and the problems of the peasantry were ignored, transforming the latter in ""a numerous and profitable mass of clients for the banks"". According to the analysis Western authors, the reform only changed the distribution of the land, and not agricultural policies; as a result of the economical and social policies of the Romanian governments, small and medium-sized farms remained unprofitable, while the large farms not affected by the reform also lost their economic role. Western authors also criticized the administrative corps of Bessarabia - ""an unstable and corrupt stratum"" - observing that transfer of administrative personnel from Romania to Bessarabia was regarded as a severe punishment, and the clerks affected generally sought personal enrichment; the local administration was also considered rigid and unwilling to reform. In general, Western historiography analyzed the modernization of Bessarabia in a general Romanian context in relation to the previous Russian period, as well as the uneven and not so fast modernization process, determined by both internal and external factors.  Overview According to Vladimir Solonar and Vladimir Bruter, Bessarabia under Romanian rule experienced low population growth due to high mortality (highest in Romania and one of the highest in Europe) as well as emigration; Bessarabia was also characterized by economic stagnation and high unemployment. Access to social services declined after the abolition of the zemstvos in the early 1920s, as these had previously provided local autonomy in managing education and public health. In the late 1930s, the Bessarabian population had among the highest incidences of several major infectious diseases and some of the highest mortality rates from these diseases.  According to Dan Dungaciu, the only European modernization process of Bessarabia was carried out during the Romanian interwar period, despite the all unfavorable domestic and international conditions (post-war recession, actions backed by the Soviet Union, worldwide Great Depression). Gheorghe Duca considers that, in terms of science, economy, art, political and social life, Bessarabia made considerable progress in the interwar period.  Nicolae Enciu appreciates that, through the political, social-economic, and cultural modernization, the interwar period meant a progress of the Romanian society, with beneficial effects in all its historical regions. At the same time, the interwar period also experienced failures, being too short to be able to produce radical transformations, in order to reduce the economic and social polarization.  Politics According to Wim P. van Meurs, after 1918 Bessarabia remained for a long time in a state of emergency, under a military administration, due to border incidents and agitation among the peasantry and the minorities. Strict censorship was imposed in order to restrain Bolshevik propaganda. Three major revolts or Soviet raids took place in the province during the first decade of Romanian rule. In January 1919, local peasants, with support from across the Dniester, rebelled against the Romanian army in the area of Hotin. A similar uprising took place later that year in Tighina. While in the first case Soviet participation is not documented, the latter was probably a Soviet raid, though van Meurs indicates it was most likely a local initiative not coordinated with the central government in Moscow. The longest-lasting rebellion took place for several weeks in 1924 in the area of Tatarbunary when the local population was instigated by agitators from the Soviet Union and proclaimed a Bessarabian Soviet Republic. In all cases, the rebellions were brutally suppressed by the Romanian army, which at times fielded artillery against the rebels.  According to Anatol Petrencu, during the most of the Romanian period, Bessarabia benefited by democracy, with a multiparty and a modern electoral system, based on the 1923 Constitution and laws. In November 1919, Romania elected the first post-war parliament based on the proportional representation of the mandates according to the number of the population. As of mid 1919, the population of Bessarabia was estimated at around 2 million. With a voter turnout of 72.2%, the Bessarabians elected and sent to the Romanian Parliament 90 deputies and 37 senators.  According to Charles King, in Romania ""the budding democracy [...] was soon crushed beneath the weight of corruption, court intrigues, and right-wing reaction"". The same author notes that corrupt and heavy-handed Romanian administrators were especially prevalent in the region, and the Siguranța, the Romanian secret police, conducted extensive surveillance among the minorities and regarded Transnistrian refugees and Bessarabian students as potential Bolshevik agents. This resulted in ""a sense among locals that Bessarabia had been occupied by Romania rather than united with"". Russians, in particular, were regarded as ""Bolsheviks in disguise"", with their churches and libraries closed down or Romanianized.  Economy At the beginning of World War I, around 80% of the population worked in agriculture. While the Sfatul Țării envisioned distributing land freely to the peasants, Romanian pressure resulted in a significant modification of the plans, bringing the reform more in line with similar ones taking place in the Old Kingdom and Transylvania. While more radical than elsewhere, as it provided lower payments, lower limits for land exempt from expropriation and larger plots, the Romanian land reform also reverted some of the ad-hoc land distribution that had taken place during the Russian Revolution, raising discontent among the peasantry. Thus, of the 1.5 million dessiatin (40% of the agricultural land) held by the large landowners in 1917, more than one third (38.6%) was distributed to peasants, another third was restored to its previous owners, while the rest became state property and was to a large degree later awarded to officers of the Romanian army, officials and clergy. A significant number of plots were awarded to Romanians immigrants from Wallachia and Western Moldavia, while Romanian offices who married Bessarabian women were eligible to receive 100 hectares. Though the reform set the lot at 6 hectares, more than two-thirds of the peasant households received less than 5 hectares each, and, as of 1931, 367.8 thousand peasant families were still landless. The average size of the peasant household further dropped after the land reform due to land division among heirs.  According to Alla Skvortsova, while the reform stimulated the development of commodity farming in the countryside and expanded the market for industrial products, it failed to produce the expected results. The peasants had to pay for the land they received during the following 20 years, there was little to no state support provided for them to acquire technical equipment required for the development of successful farms and credit was only accessible to the more prosperous among them and therefore insignificant overall. The region also lacked qualified specialists and lagged behind in infrastructure, as the government had few resources and other priorities. The main factors which impeded the creation of a prosperous peasant class were the payments for land redemption, peasant debts, and taxes, lack of access to the traditional Russian market, difficulties to break into the Romanian and European agricultural market and frequent droughts (1921, 1924, 1925, 1927–28 and 1935). Winemaking, one of the mainstays of the local economy, was particularly affected by the external policy of the Romanian state: the most favoured nation status awarded to France brought inexpensive French wine to the local market, access to the Soviet market was blocked, while exports to the traditional markets in Poland were hindered by the trade war started in 1926.  According to Alla Skvortsova, the peasant situation was further aggravated by the Great Depression in Romania, with prices for agricultural products dropping catastrophically and not recovering until the end of the decade. While only 2.8% of the national agricultural credit was directed by the National Bank of Romania towards Bessarabia in 1936, by 1940 70% of the peasants were in debt to the large landowners and moneylenders. In order to pay debts, many of the poorer peasants had to sell their livestock and even their land. Failure to pay the redemption payments for 2.5 years also resulted in the land reverting to state property; thus, by 1938, in the district of Soroca only a quarter of the peasant households had retained their allotment. By 1939 farms of up to 5 hectares throughout the region had lost a seventh of their land, while farms with more than 10 hectares had increased their land by 26%. According to a study of the new Soviet administration, in June 1940 7.3% of the peasant households in the Bessarabian regions of the Moldavian SSR were completely landless, 38.15% had up to 3 hectares (an average of 1.7 hectares per lot) and 22.4% had 3 to 5 hectares (an average of 2.6 hectares per one household), i.e. more than two-thirds of the peasant households were farm laborers and poor peasants. Better off was the middle peasantry, which owned 5 to 10 hectares, and constituted 22.73% of peasant farms. The rest, constituting 9.4% of the farms, owned more than 10 hectares each, but held under their control 36% of peasant land, i.e. more than all small farms taken together. The 818 large landowners held an average of 100 hectares each, while institutional owners (the state, churches, and monasteries) held another 59 thousand hectares. About 54% of peasant households had no livestock, about two-thirds had no horse, a little more than a sixth had one horse each, and only 13.2% had two or more working horses. In the whole of Bessarabian region of the Moldavian SSR there were at the beginning of Soviet administration only 219 obsolete tractors, mostly owned by larger farms and used primarily as threshing engines. With little serviceable equestrian equipment, tillage, sowing, and harvesting of all crops were mostly carried out manually. Throughout the interwar era, Bessarabia witnessed several negative phenomena: further social stratification in the countryside, deepening poverty, lowering yields, worsening of the structure of crops grown, reduction of the total agricultural production. The number of cattle fell by 26% between 1926 and 1938, the number of sheep by 5%, the number of pigs by 14%. Average grain yield also decreased from 1920/1925 to 1935/1939 from 850 kg per hectare to 800 kg. The area used in wine-making grew by 15,000 hectares between 1930 and 1938. However, wine quality dropped, as slightly over 80% of the vineyards were planted with lower quality grape varieties. According to V.I. Tsaranov, adding to the lack of land, small plots, poor crop yields, unemployment was also high among rural residents, with around 550 thousand recorded in June 1940.  According to Alla Skvortsova, the Romanian government, either directly or through the banking system, encouraged the development of industry in the areas of prewar Romania, while hindering the process in new territories. As a consequence, even Bessarabian entrepreneurs preferred to invest their capital in those areas instead of using it within the region. Local industry faced fierce competition from larger Romanian companies, which had access to preferential rail tariffs, limited credit to local entrepreneurs, and flooded the local market with cheaper industrial goods produced in Romania or imported from abroad. Nevertheless, some new small-scale industrial enterprises were established in the 1920s, using primarily local raw materials and producing for the local market. The total engine power rose from 7.8 thousand hp in 1925 to 12.2 thousand in 1929. Although the number of industrial enterprises more than doubled after 1918, small semi-handicraft production prevailed, seldomly using hired labor: in 1930 there were an average of only 2.4 employees per enterprise. During the 22 years of Romanian rule, only one large enterprise was built in Bessarabia: the Bălți sugar plant.  According to Alla Skvortsova, not all new enterprises survived for long, and the Great Depression had a particularly strong impact on the region, many of the companies going bankrupt or closing in 1929–1933. Governmental policy, influenced by the banking system and the industrial cartels, prevented a rebound, the industry of the Old Kingdom again receiving preferential treatment. The main factors that affected the development of Bessarabia in the 1930s were severe credit restrictions, increases in transport tariffs and customs restrictions, and special tax policies. The tax burden was notably high, with enterprises required to fully provide the assigned tax agent with housing, heating, lighting, and office space. Bessarabia was reduced mostly to a supplier of raw materials and a market for industrial goods of Romanian or foreign origin. By the end of the 1930s, the only industrial sectors that managed to rebound were the food and woodworking industries, the rest witnessing either stagnation or a decrease compared to pre-Depression levels. Most industrial facilities in the food industry worked significantly below their installed capacity even in prosperous years such as 1937. Several large factories, such as the Basarabeasca, Cetatea Albă, Florești and Tighina, railway workshops, the Cetatea Albă and Chișinău textile and knitwear factories and the Cetatea Albă canning factory and distillery were dismantled and relocated to the Old Kingdom by 1938. Between 1929 and 1937, fixed capital in the industry dropped by 10%, and the number of industrial workers in Bessarabia dropped from 5,400 in 1925 to 3,500 in 1937, while their overall number in Romania had increased by almost 27% during the same period. Between 1926 and 1937 the share of the food industry in the total production of large manufacturing industries increased from 77.1% to 92.4%, with sharp decreases observed in sectors with higher added value, such as the metalworking, textile and leather processing industries. Even so, the food industry failed to fulfill local needs; most industries heavily relied on manual labor and primitive technologies. Electricity production in Chișinău, Bessarabia's center and Romania's second-largest city, recorded in 1925 at 4.47 million kWh, only increased by 6.7% during the following decade, lagging far behind other Romanian cities: 572.3% in Galați, 238.2% in Bucharest, and over 101% in Iași. By the end of the 1930s, only one in seven Bessarabians had access to electricity, compared to one in four among the general Romanian population.  The Romanian administration carried out many projects aimed at improving the infrastructure of the province to introduce European gauge and reorient it towards Romania. The total length of the railway lines in Bessarabia increased only by 78 km (from 1140 in 1918 to 1218 in 1940). Local businessmen remained dissatisfied with the pace of the construction of new railways (the Chișinău-Căinari was the only one built anew) and the closure of a number of lines. Road infrastructure was also improved, as new highways and bridges over the Prut were built, while part of the existing roads were repaired and paved, increasing the length of highways from 150 to 754 km. However, most other roads remained impassable during rainy periods. Shipping on the Dniester was closed, and was never established on the Prut. In the 1930s, new airports were built, telephone lines were laid out, and radio transmitters were installed; nevertheless, the region still lagged behind Transylvania and the Old Kingdom.  According to Alla Skvortsova, overall, the share of Bessarabian enterprises in the Romanian industry fell between 1919 and 1937 from 9% to 5.7%, while the number of enterprises employing at least 20 employees dropping from 262 to 196. The share of investments in Bessarabian industry also fell from 0.3% in 1923 to 0.1% in 1936. Sociologist T. Al. Ştirbu observed, commenting on the Romanian government's apparent long-term economical plans, that ""Bessarabia can only be considered as a reserve of labor and cheap bread for the industry of the rest of the country"". In a 1938 review, the Bessarabian Federation of Chambers of Commerce noted that ""the decline in industrial production in Bessarabia hinders the rational processing of local raw materials, thereby turning our province into a colony for industry in the rest of the country"". According to V.I. Tsaranov, throughout the period, industrial workers in the region faced long working hours (up to fourteen per day), lack of proper safety measures, unsanitary conditions, the perspective of unemployment and a general decrease in the standard of living: the real wage of a Chișinău worker dropped 60% between 1913 and 1937.  Education In 1919, Bessarabia became the Romanian region with the highest illiteracy rate. Although the Romanian/Moldovan population was the largest, no Romanian language school operated in Bessarabia before 1918. As a result, among them, only 10.5% of men and 1.77% of women were literate. By 1930, although Bessarabia continued to be the region with the most illiterate people in Romania, the number of literates doubled, to 38,1% of the total population. In the 1920-1938 period, the number of primary schools increased from 1,747 to 2,718, and the number of students from 136,172 to 346,747. In 1940, there were also 24 gymnasiums and middle schools and 26 high schools. Despite a large number of minorities (over 870,000 Russians, Ukrainians, and Jews), education in minority languages was curtailed: private schools were allowed to function after 1925 only if the instruction was in Romanian and, by 1938, there were no state-  sponsored Russian or Ukrainian schools and only one each in private hands. In 1939, after the German and Soviet attacks on Poland, the government reverted on its earlier policy and decided to reintroduce minority language classes in state schools and allow a greater degree of cultural expression for the Slavic minorities, in an effort to improve its image among the local population.  Also, in the interwar period, the foundations were laid for the first higher education institutions in Bessarabia. In 1926, the Faculty of Theology was established in Chișinău, followed by the National Conservatory in 1928, and the Faculty of Agricultural Sciences in 1933. The two faculties were sections of the University of Iași, in pre-war Romania.  World War II   The Soviet Union did not recognize the incorporation of Bessarabia into Romania and throughout the entire interwar period engaged in attempts to undermine Romania and diplomatic disputes with the government in Bucharest over this territory. The Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact was signed on August 23, 1939. By Article 4 of the secret Annex to the Treaty, Nazi Germany recognized Bessarabia as belonging to the Soviet ""sphere of interest"".  In the spring of 1940, Western Europe was overrun by Germany. With world attention focused on those events, on June 26, 1940, the USSR issued a 24-hour ultimatum to Romania, demanding immediate cession of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina under threat of war. Romania was given four days to evacuate its troops and officials. The two provinces had an area of , and were inhabited by about 3.75 million people, half of them Romanians, according to official Romanian sources. Two days later, Romania yielded and began evacuation. During the evacuation, from June 28 to July 3, groups of local Communists and Soviet sympathizers attacked the retreating forces and civilians who chose to leave. Many members of the minorities (Jews, ethnic Ukrainians and others) joined in these attacks. The Romanian Army was also attacked by the Soviet Army, which entered Bessarabia before the Romanian administration finished retreating. The casualties reported by the Romanian Army during those seven days consisted of 356 officers and 42,876 soldiers dead or missing.  On August 2, the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic was established on most of the territory of Bessarabia, merged with the western parts of the former Moldavian ASSR. Bessarabia was divided between the Moldavian SSR (65% of the territory and 80% of the population) and the Ukrainian SSR. Bessarabia's northern and southern districts (now Budjak and parts of the Chernivtsi oblast) were allotted to Ukraine, while some territories (4,000 km2) on the left (eastern) bank of Dniester (present Transnistria), previously part of Ukraine, were allotted to Moldavia. Following the Soviet takeover, many Bessarabians, who were accused of supporting the deposed Romanian administration, were executed or deported to Siberia and Kazakhstan.  Between September and November 1940, the ethnic Germans of Bessarabia were offered resettlement to Germany, following a German-Soviet agreement. Fearing Soviet oppression, almost all Germans (93,000) agreed. Most of them were resettled to the newly annexed Polish territories.  On June 22, 1941 the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union commenced with Operation Barbarossa. Between June 22 and July 26, 1941, Romanian troops recovered Bessarabia and northern Bukovina with the help of Wehrmacht. The Soviets employed scorched earth tactics during their forced retreat from Bessarabia, destroying the infrastructure and transporting movable goods to Russia by railway. At the end of July, after a year of Soviet rule, the region was once again under Romanian control, being organized as the Bessarabia Governorate.  As the military operation was still in progress, there were cases of Romanian troops ""taking revenge"" on Jews in Bessarabia, in the form of pogroms on civilians and murder of Jewish POWs, resulting in several thousand dead. The supposed cause for murdering Jews was that in 1940 some Jews welcomed the Soviet takeover as liberation. At the same time the notorious SS Einsatzgruppe D, operating in the area of the German 11th Army, committed summary executions of Jews under the pretext that they were spies, saboteurs, Communists, or under no pretext whatsoever.  The political solution of the ""Jewish Question"" was apparently seen by the Romanian dictator Marshal Ion Antonescu more in expulsion rather than extermination. That portion of the Jewish population of Bessarabia and Bukovina which did not flee before the retreat of the Soviet troops (147,000) was initially gathered into ghettos or Nazi concentration camps, and then deported during 1941–1942 in death marches into Romanian-occupied Transnistria, where the ""Final Solution"" was applied.  After three years of relative peace, the German-Soviet front returned in 1944 to the land border on the Dniester. On August 20, 1944, a c. 3,400,000-strong Red Army began a major summer offensive codenamed Second Jassy–Kishinev offensive. The Soviet armies overran Bessarabia in a two-pronged offensive within five days. In pocket battles at Chișinău and Sărata the German 6th Army of  650,000 men, newly reformed after the Battle of Stalingrad, was obliterated. Simultaneously with the success of the Russian attack, Romania broke the military alliance with the Axis and changed sides. On August 23, 1944, Marshal Ion Antonescu was arrested by King Michael, and later handed over to the Soviets.  Part of the Soviet Union   The Soviet Union regained the region in 1944, and the Red Army occupied Romania. By 1947, the Soviets had imposed a communist government in Bucharest, which was friendly and obedient towards Moscow. The Soviet occupation of Romania lasted until 1958. The Romanian communist regime did not openly raise the matter of Bessarabia or Northern Bukovina in its diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. At least 100,000 people died in a post-war famine in Moldavia.  Between 1969 and 1971, a clandestine National Patriotic Front was established by several young intellectuals in Chișinău, totaling over 100 members, vowing to fight for the establishment of a Moldavian Democratic Republic, its secession from the Soviet Union and union with Romania.  In December 1971, following an informative note from , the President of the Council of State Security of the Romanian Socialist Republic, to Yuri Andropov, the chief of KGB, three of the leaders of the National Patriotic Front, Alexandru Usatiuc-Bulgar, Gheorghe Ghimpu and Valeriu Graur, as well as a fourth person, Alexandru Soltoianu, the leader of a similar clandestine movement in northern Bukovina (Bucovina), were arrested and later sentenced to long prison terms.  Rise of independent Moldova   With the weakening of the Soviet Union, in February 1988, the first non-sanctioned demonstrations were held in Chișinău. At first pro-Perestroika, they soon turned anti-government and demanded official status for the Romanian (Moldavian) language instead of the Russian language. On August 31, 1989, following a 600,000-strong demonstration in Chișinău four days earlier, Romanian (Moldavian) became the official language of the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic. However, this was not implemented for many years. In 1990, the first free elections were held for Parliament, with the opposition Popular Front winning them. A government led by Mircea Druc, one of the leaders of the Popular Front, was formed. The Moldavian SSR became SSR Moldova, and later the Republic of Moldova. The Republic of Moldova became independent on August 31, 1991; it took over unchanged the boundaries of the Moldavian SSR.  Population  According to Bessarabian historian Ștefan Ciobanu and Moldovan philologist Viorica Răileanu, in 1810, the Romanian (Moldavian) population was approximately 95%. During the 19th century, as a result of the Russian policy of colonization and Russification, the Romanian population decreased to (depending on data sources) 47.6% (in 1897), 52% or 75% for 1900 (Krusevan), 53.9% (1907), 70% (1912, Laskov), or 65–67% (1918, J. Kaba).  The Russian Census of 1817, which recorded 96,526 families and 482,630 inhabitants, did not register ethnic data except for recent refugees (primarily Bulgarians) and certain ethno-social categories (Jews, Armenians and Greeks). Official records indicated 3,826 Jewish families (4.2%), 1,200 Lipovan families (1.5%), 640 Greek families (0.7%), 530 Armenian families (0.6%), 482 Bulgarian and Gagauz families (0.5%). In the 20th century, Romanian historian Ion Nistor extrapolated the number of Romanians at 83,848 families (86%) and Ruthenians at 6,000 families (6.5%). The estimate was based on the assumption that Ruthenes constituted up to a third of the population of the Khotyn county, and the rest of the recorded population was exclusively Moldavian or Romanian. An alternative estimate for the same year indicates 76.4% Romanians, 8.7% Ukrainians, 5.1% Bulgarians and Gaguzes, 4.5% Jews and 2% Russians. An 1818 statistic of three counties in southern Bessarabia (Akkerman, Izmail and Bender) that had witnessed strong emigration of the Muslim population and immigration from other regions, including Ottoman lands south of the Danube, recorded a total population of 113,835. There are conflicting figures regarding the national distribution (first figure cited by Poștarencu, second by Ungureanu): 48.64/37% Moldavians, 7.07/8.9% Russians, 15.65/17.9% Ukrainians, 17.02/21.5% Bulgarians and 11.62/14.7% others. Still in 1818, statistics for the Khotyn county in northern Bessarabia indicated 47.5% Moldavians and 42.6% Ukrainians.  The Moldovan historian Ion Gumenâi records the population of Bessarabia in 1828 as 517,135, and states that 376,910 were Romanians (72.88%), 52,000 Ruthenians (10.05%), 30,929 Jews (5.9%), 8,846 Germans (1.71%), 7,947 Russians (1.53%), 5,974 Lipovans (1.15%), 2,384 Poles (0.46%), 2,000 Greeks (0.38%), 2,000 Armenians (0.38%), and 27,445 (5.3%) settlers in the south of Bessarabia.  The first statistic to record ethnic groups throughout Bessarabia was an incomplete administrative census made in 1843–1844 at the request of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The following proportions were recorded, in a total of 692,777 inhabitants: 59.4% Moldavians, 17.2% Ukrainians, 9.3% Bulgarians, 7.1% Jews, and 2.2% Russians. In the case of some urban centres, figures were not reported for all ethnic groups. Furthermore, the size of the total populations differs from other official reports of the same period, which put the population of Bessarabia at 774,492 or 793,103.  Church records gathered around 1850–1855 put the total population at 841,523, with the following composition: 51.4% Moldavians, 4.2% Russians, 21.3% Ukrainians, 10% Bulgarians, 7.2% Jews and 5.7% others. On the other hand, official data for 1855 record a total population of 980,031, excluding the population on the territory under the authority of the Special Administration of the town of Izmail.  According to Ion Nistor, the population of Bessarabia in 1856 was composed of 736,000 Romanians (74%), 119,000 Ukrainians (12%), 79,000 Jews (8%), 47,000 Bulgarians and Gagauz (5%), 24,000 Germans (2.4%), 11,000 Romani (1.1%), 6,000 Russians (0.6%), adding to a total of 990,274 inhabitants. Historian Constantin Ungureanu provides significantly different figures for the same year: 676,100 Romanians (68.2%), 126,000 Ukrainians (12.7%), 78,800 Jews (7.9%), 48,200 Bulgarians and Gaguz (4.9%), 24,200 (2.4%) Germans and 20,000 Russians (2%) for a total of 991,900.  Russian data, 1889 (Total: 1,628,867 inhabitants)  The Russian census in 1897 had a total of 1,935,412 inhabitants. By language:  920,919 Moldavians and Romanians (47.6%)  379,698 Ukrainians (19.6%)  228,168 Jews (11.8%)  155,774 Russians (8%)  103,225 Bulgarians (5.3%)  60,026 Germans (3.1%)  55,790 Turks (Gagauzes) (2.9%)  However, some scholars believed in regard to the 1897 census that ""[...] the census enumerator generally has instructions to count everyone who understands the state language as being of that nationality, no matter what his everyday speech may be"". Thus a number of Moldavians (Romanians) might have been registered as Russians.  According to N. Durnovo, the population of Bessarabia in 1900 was (1,935,000 inhabitants):  Notes: 1 The two counties were merged.  The Romanian estimates in 1919 (1922) gave a total populations of 2,631,000 inhabitants:   1,685,000 Romanians (64.0%)  254,000 Ukrainians (9.7%)  287,000 Jews (10.2%)  75,000 Russians (2.8%)  147,000 Bulgarians (5.6%)  79,000 Germans (3.0%)  59,000 Lipovans and Cossacks (2.2%)  67,000 Others (2.5%)  According to the 1930 Romanian census, the total population of Bessarabia was 2,864,662 inhabitants:  Notes: 1 Includes Lipovans. 2 Poles, Armenians, Albanians, Greeks, Gypsies, etc. and non-declared  The data of the Romanian census of 1939 was not completely processed before the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia. However, estimates had the total population rise to approximately 3.2 million.  The census of 1941, during the Romanian wartime administration (Total: 2,733,563 inhabitants):  1,793,493 Romanians (65.6%)  449,540 Ukrainians (16.4%)  177,647 Bulgarians (6.5%)  164,410 Russians (6.0%)  115,683 Gagauz (4.2%)  9,086 Poles (0.3%)  6,882 Jews (0.3%)  2,058 Germans (0.1%)  14,794 Others (0.6%)  In the 1979 Soviet census for the Moldavian SSR (including Transnistria, but without northern and southern Bessarabia, now both part of Ukraine): 63.9% identified themselves as Moldovans and 0.04% as Romanians. For the Soviet census of 1989 (conducted in the Moldavian SSR), 64.5% declared themselves as Moldovans and 0.06% Romanians. In the Moldovan census of 2014 (not including Transnistria), 75% declared themselves Moldovans and 7% Romanians.  Economy   1911: There were 165 loan societies, 117 savings banks, 43 professional savings and loan societies, and eight Zemstvo loan offices; all these had total assets of about 10,000,000 rubles. There were also 89 government savings banks, with deposits of about 9,000,000 rubles.  1918: There was only  of railway; the main lines converged on Russia and were broad gauge. Rolling stock and right of way were in bad shape. There were about 400 locomotives, with only about 100 fit for use. There were 290 passenger coaches and 33 more out for repair. Finally, out of 4530 freight cars and 187 tank cars, only 1389 and 103 were usable. The Romanians reduced the gauge to a standard , so that cars could be run to the rest of Europe. Also, there were only a few inefficient boat bridges. Romanian highway engineers decided to build ten bridges: Cuzlău, Țuțora, Lipcani, Șerpenița, Ștefănești–Brăniște, Cahul-Oancea, Bădărăi-Moara Domnească, Sărata, Bumbala-Leova, Badragi and Fălciu (Fălciu is a locality in Romania. Its correspondent in Bessarabia is Cantemir.) Of these, only four were ever finished: Cuzlău, Fălciu, Lipcani, and Sărata.  See also  References    Thilemann, Alfred.

Nadir Ali Khan,"  Early life  Khan was born on 16 June 1931 in Rataul, into a family of Islamic scholars.  He was appointed as reader in Aligarh Muslim University, later becoming professor of Urdu Language and then honorary consultant of the department.   Khan journeyed to acquaint himself with the centres of Islamic importance in India, where he met Sheikh ul-Hadith Muhammad Zakariya al-Kandahlawi (1898–1982) and the reformer Maulana Muhammad Yusuf Kandhalawi, from whom he learned dawah and reformation.  Soon after, he attended Lucknow University and earned a PhD.  Work  Khan is a prolific writer in Urdu.  Perhaps his best-known work is A history in Urdu Journalism (1822–1857) (1991), which examines newspapers from nine different cities.  His works are part of the syllabi in various universities, and several have been translated into English.  His wide-ranging study of Urdu journalistic literature is a contribution of abiding value to the appreciation of India ethos at a crucial moment in Indian history.  His extensive study of contemporary Urdu literature, his rare insight into the process of social change and, above all, his unique faculty of analysis and interpretation are each reflected in his study which opens fresh vistas for the interpretation of socio-political history of modern India.  Lately the French historian Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie has studied the culture of the small French village Montaillou on the basis of Jacques Fouiern's Register's.  His work is rightly claimed as constituting a landmark in modern historiography.  No such work has so far been undertaken in India.  The newspapers from Mirzapur, Benaras, Meerut, Bareilly, Rampur, etc., brought to light by Khan, will hopefully one day attract scholars to undertake similar studies of the intellectual and social milieu of the Indian towns.  He prepared grounds for the utilization of journalistic literature for the reconstruction of the cultural history of India during the 19th century.  Due to his sermons and simple and modest lifestyle, Dr Nadir Ali Khan commands respect from Muslims all over the world.  He has a simple, eloquent and distinctive style of explaining the purpose of human life and its creation and often uses scientific examples to support his argument. He has delivered lectures to all types of communities in the society with the attendees being doctors, engineers, professors, businessmen, landlords, government officials, TV/film artists, ministers/politicians and sports celebrities. His untiring efforts brought real Islamic values in the lives of many Muslims.

Yavoriv,"Yavoriv (, ,  Yavorov) is a city located in Lviv Oblast (region) of western Ukraine near the Polish border. It is the administrative center of Yavoriv Raion and rests approximately  west of the oblast capital, Lviv. Its population is approximately .  Not far from it is the watering-place of Shklo with sulfur springs.  History The town was first mentioned in written documents in 1436. It received Magdeburg rights in 1569, from Polish King Sigismund II Augustus. Jaworów was a royal town of Poland. It was a favorite residence of king John III Sobieski. In 1675 John III signed the Polish-French Treaty of Jaworów in the town, and there he also received the congratulations from the Pope on his success against the Turks at Vienna (1683).  Until the Partitions of Poland, Jaworów was an important center of commerce, located along main merchant route from Jarosław to Lwów. In 1772 it was annexed by the Habsburg Empire, as part of Austrian Galicia, where it remained until late 1918. In Galicia, it was the seat of a county, with the population of almost 11,000 (Poles, Jews, Ukrainians and Czechs).  In the immediate post-World War I period, the area of Jaworów witnessed fights of the Polish-Ukrainian War. After the war, the town became part of the Second Polish Republic, where it remained until the joint German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II, in September 1939. The Jews of the village were merchants or artisans. There was a synagogue.   During the invasion of Poland, on September 14–16, 1939, Poles defeated invading Germans in the Battle of Jaworów. Despite the victory, the town soon fell to the Soviets, and was under Soviet occupation from 1939 to 1941, and then under German occupation until 1944.  The Jewish population before the German occupation on June 26, 1941 was around 3000. Immediately after the Germans arrived, antisemitic Ukrainians launched a pogrom, robbing and killing Jews.  German forces took 15 Jews to a nearby forest and shot them. After that, for several months, Jews lived in their own homes but were banned on the main street and had a 6 pm curfew.  The Ukrainian police brutalized them, with beatings and some plunder and rape.  Several hundred Jews were sent to local forced labor camps.  In November 1942, German security forces, along with German and Ukrainian police, rounded up 1200 Jews, killed 200 on the spot, and sent the others to the Belzec killing camp where they were immediately murdered. A few days later, German and Ukrainian police hunted Jews in hiding and murdered about 200 at the Jewish cemetery.  After that, the Germans established a Jewish ghetto which housed about 600 Jews.  Soon after, Jews from a few neighboring villages were brought to Yavoriv bringing the ghetto population to 6000.  More than 70 people lived in each of the 80 small houses in the ghetto.  The overcrowding, starvation, and poor sanitary conditions soon led to a typhus epidemic.  After about 500 more able-bodied Jews were sent to a labor camp, on April 16, 1943, the German and Ukrainian police took more than 3500 Jews  to the Porudno forest and murdered them.  More than 2500 Jews were murdered before noon on the 16th, the rest over the next few days.  The Germans and Ukrainians burned the ghetto and searched for those in hiding.  Those found were shot.  A few were transferred to a labor camp in Lwow.  In 1944 the town was re-occupied by the Soviets, and in 1945 it was eventually annexed from Poland by the Soviet Union.  After the war, the Soviet Extraordinary State Commission reported that more than 4900 people, most of them Jews, had been killed in Yavoriv, in addition to those sent to Belzec.  Only about 20 of the town's Jews were thought to have survived.  Notable people Among notable people born here are Władysław Langner (General of the Polish Army), Stanisław Nowakowski (president of the Polish Scouting and Guiding Association), and mathematician Wawrzyniec Żmurko.

Andreas Heusler,"Andreas Heusler (10 August 1865 – 28 February 1940) was a Swiss philologist who specialized in Germanic studies. He was a Professor of Germanic Philology at the University of Berlin and a renowned authority on early Germanic literature.  Life  Andreas Heusler was born into a prestigious family in Basel, the third in a line of fathers and sons bearing the same name (his father was Andreas Heusler (1834–1921) and his grandfather Andreas Heusler (1802–1868); both worked in law and government). Andreas enjoyed a stellar career as a student in Basel, Freiburg im Breisgau, and Berlin, completing his studies in 1887 in Freiburg with the doctoral thesis ""Beitrag zum Consonantismus der Mundart von Baselstadt"".  In 1890, when Heusler was 25 years old, he began lecturing in Berlin and was a professor of Nordic textual studies there from 1894 to 1913. He focused on research into Old Norse literature, especially the Poetic Edda and Íslendingasögur, translating many works into German and travelling twice to Iceland. From 1914 to 1919, Heusler was professor of Germanic textual studies at Berlin University. He moved back to Switzerland in 1920 and lived in Arlesheim near Basel, where a place was made for him at Basel University, where he worked until he reached the age limit in 1936.    Besides ancient Germanic and Nordic culture, Heusler was noted for his love of music (he played the violin); around 1889 he switched from a strongly held Christianity to being a confirmed atheist. There is some debate as to where Heusler stood on German nationalism in the 1930s. He seems at first to have been swayed by it, but it is thought that he turned his back on Adolf Hitler around 1938. A good insight into his thoughts is offered by the four hundred letters to Wilhelm Ranisch which he wrote in the period 1890–1940.  In 1893, Heusler married the singer Auguste Hohenschild, who was fourteen years his senior. The marriage was unhappy and they divorced in 1922, having been separated since 1901. Heusler died in Basel in 1940 after a short illness.  Influence  Andreas Heusler was among the most influential figures in early Germanic studies in the first half of the twentieth century, and much of his work still resonates today.

History  In 1921, João Alves Cerqueira opened his first coffee shop at number 91 of what was then known as ""Rua dos Mercadores"" or Merchants' Street.  The name ""Mercadores"" refers to merchants who traded along this street during medieval times.   In 1927 he moved into premises that had previously been occupied by another cafe called ""A Brasileira"" which dated from 1905.    By 1929 it became one of the most popular cafés in town attracting many famous people including writers such as Eça de Queiroz and Camilo Castelo Branco;  musicians like Alfredo Keil; actors like Sarah Bernhardt and Charlie Chaplin; politicians like António Salazar and Winston Churchill among others.  During World War II, the building suffered severe damage when bombs fell nearby but reopened after the war under new management.   It has since changed hands several times before being bought by its current owners in 1988.   Since 1997 there have also been two other branches opened:   one in Lisbon near Rossio Square and another branch in Braga.   Both are now closed down although they were both very successful businesses until their closure.",wikipedia,bigscience/bloomz,Café Majestic,0.016985138004246284,0.5333333333333333,0.010745293561420097,0.43636363636363634,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0.022222717443068574,0.03636289901318723,0.019862180786380218,0.04903677758318739,3,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1
Incarnate (film),"Incarnate is a 2016 American supernatural horror film directed by Brad Peyton and written by Ronnie Christensen. It stars Aaron Eckhart, Carice van Houten,  Catalina Sandino Moreno, David Mazouz,  Keir O'Donnell, Matt Nable, and John Pirruccello.  The film was released on December 2, 2016, by Blumhouse Tilt and High Top Releasing.  Plot An 11-year-old boy named Cameron Sparrow is attacked by a hooded stranger who tries to kill him. However, Cameron kills her instead and looks at the camera with red eyes, revealing that he is actually possessed by a demon named ""Maggie"".  Meanwhile, Dr. Seth Ember approaches a man named Henry in a club and makes him realize he is dreaming. Ember reveals that the woman Henry has been with is a demon who has possessed his body. The two escape and return to reality, and Henry is freed from the demon. In the waking world, Ember actually uses a wheelchair. Ember's assistant Oliver warns that the demons have started to adapt to Ember's efforts and that soon he may not be able to escape back to reality.  Ember is approached by Camilla, a representative from the Vatican, who asks him to exorcise Cameron. Ember refuses, stating that his methods are not ""exorcisms,"" but Camilla reveals that she believes the demon is one Ember knows. Ember visits a priest named Felix to question whether the demon could indeed be Maggie, which Felix affirms. Felix offers him a vial of blood from a possessed man which, when injected, would allow Ember about ten seconds of lucidity - just enough time to commit suicide, but he refuses.  Ember meets the boy's mother Lindsay and explains that he does not exorcise demons but evicts them by entering their host's subconscious to make them realize they are dreaming. Demons do not have the power to truly control those they possess; instead, they lull their hosts into comforting dreams so they will be unaware while the demon uses their body. He visits the possessed Cameron and the demon recognizes him.  Ember, Oliver, and, the third member of their team, Riley prepare for the eviction. Riley explains that by entering a near-death state, Ember will be able to synchronize his brain frequencies to Cameron's and enter his subconscious. However in this state, Ember has only about eight minutes before his heart will give out. Ember enters Cameron's dream and sees him with his father, Dan, but has a seizure and has to be pulled out of the dream to be revived.  Ember demands that Dan be present to help evict the demon. Lindsay refuses, explaining that the couple separated after Dan broke Cameron's arm in a drunken rage, but she agrees when Ember insists that Cameron's father might be the only way to save Cameron. Dan's presence initially seems to help, but Maggie lashes out at him. Ember pleads with Maggie to release Dan since Ember is the one Maggie wants. The demon does so but Dan dies from his injuries. Lindsay, alarmed, demands to know Ember's history with the demon. Ember reveals he discovered that he had the power to perform astral projection and enter the dreams of other people, but hid his power to live a normal life. However, this made him a target for demons. One day, while driving with his wife and child, the three were hit by a car driven by a possessed driver. The attack left Ember's family dead and is the reason that he needs to use a wheelchair, and ever since, he's been hunting the demon ""Maggie,"" whom he named after the woman it had possessed.  Ember visits Felix to acquire the blood vial but discovers that Felix has been possessed. Felix attacks Ember and commits suicide. Returning to Cameron's dream, Ember uses a ring Cameron had received as a gift from his real father to make the boy realize he is in an illusion. The pair flee from Maggie, and Ember helps Cameron escape. Ember and Cameron wake up, but Ember wakes up again in a hospital with his wife and son. He realizes he's now inside his own dream and begs Maggie to release Cameron and take him instead, to which the demon agrees. However, when Ember wakes up, Riley administers the blood and Ember uses his ten seconds to throw himself through the apartment window. As he dies, Riley warns everybody not to touch Ember's body.  Paramedics attempt to resuscitate Ember, joined by Camilla. They succeed in getting a heartbeat, allowing Maggie to possess Camilla, before Ember dies.

Plot summary[edit] In this movie we see how God sent His son into our world as man so that He could die on the cross in order to save us all.  The story begins at night when Mary receives word she will give birth to God's Son within three days' time.   She travels down through Judea where she gives birth to her firstborn child who they name ""Jesus"".    As he grows up, Jesus becomes very popular among people because of his miracles which include healing many sick people by touching them or speaking words over their heads.     At age 12 years old, Jesus goes off to live with John the Baptist until he returns home after being baptized by him in water.   After returning home, Jesus continues preaching throughout Israel teaching everyone what it means to love one another like Himself did.   During Passover week, Jesus calls together twelve disciples whom are chosen out of thousands of men; these would be known as ""The Apostles"".   On Palm Sunday, Jesus enters Jerusalem riding on a colt while crowds cheer ""Hosanna! Blessed Is He Who Cometh In The Name Of The Lord!""   When questioned why he's entering Jerusalem, Jesus says ""Blessed Are Those That Fear Not For I Am With You All Days Until A Thousand Years And More...""",wikipedia,bigscience/bloomz,Incarnate (film),0.11464968152866242,0.6666666666666666,0.09464454568898822,0.4954545454545455,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0.021808991289977354,0.02299693690210831,0.029185245237130116,0.03327495621716287,6,0,5,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

List of Mass Effect characters,"The Mass Effect series, a military science fiction media franchise developed by Canadian video game developer BioWare and owned by American publisher Electronic Arts, features an extensive cast of characters. It is primarily based on a series of third-person role-playing shooter video games which currently consists of four mainline instalments and two spin-off mobile games. The first three Mass Effect games takes place in the Milky Way Galaxy during the 22nd century and revolves around a space navy soldier named Commander Shepard. The fourth Mass Effect game is a standalone sequel to the original trilogy but set in a different galaxy, Andromeda, and focuses on the Andromeda Initiative and the Ryder family. The spin-off games, Mass Effect Galaxy and Mass Effect Infiltrator, feature different protagonists.  This article describes characters who appear in video games set in the  Mass Effect universe, which includes a diverse cast of alien, human and synthetic characters. This list describes only player characters, squad members, major antagonists, and other notable characters that appear in the games. Certain characters have names chosen by the player; these characters are designated the name they are addressed by in-game. The appearance and story arcs of certain characters in Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3 are conditional upon decisions from prior Mass Effect titles being carried over via an imported save file.  Player characters  Commander Shepard   Commander Shepard is the central protagonist of the original Mass Effect trilogy of video games. On an assignment to investigate a besieged human colony, Shepard is affected by a Prothean artifact that grants them insight on the Reapers, making them the key entity to help protect the species of the Milky Way from being wiped out by the Reapers. Shepard is later named the first human Spectre by the Citadel Council, and given command of the SSV Normandy and its crew to complete their mission.  The character's given name, gender, background, and appearance are determined by the player on starting a new game, with both Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3 allowing the player to import saves from previous games to carry over that version of Shepard. Depending on the choice of gender, Shepard is voiced by either Mark Meer or Jennifer Hale. The default male version's face and body is based on the likeness of fashion model Mark Vanderloo.  Jeff ""Joker"" Moreau   Jeff Moreau, better known by his nickname ""Joker"", is the pilot of the Normandy. Joker is a skilled pilot who has osteogenesis imperfecta. His nickname alludes to his tendency to behave as a sarcastic foil to other individuals he interact with. In Mass Effect 2, Joker briefly becomes a playable character when the Collectors invade the Normandy to capture its crew in the absence of Shepard and the squad. He can develop a romantic relationship with EDI in Mass Effect 3 if encouraged.  Joker is voiced by Seth Green.  Jacob Taylor Jacob Taylor is the protagonist of Mass Effect Galaxy, a tie-in iOS game to Mass Effect 2. He is a former Systems Alliance soldier who is recruited by Miranda Lawson in Galaxy to investigate a conspiracy involving batarian terrorists. Jacob is encountered in Mass Effect 2 as an official member of Cerberus and Shepard's starting squad member, as well as a potential romantic option for a female Shepard. Unless the player imports a Mass Effect 2 saved game where Jacob does not survive the suicide mission, in Mass Effect 3 he returns as a supporting character who has defected from Cerberus, and attempts to protect other Cerberus defectors from reprisals by their former employer.  The iconic look of all Cerberus clothing in the series is derived from the designs for Jacob's armor and clothing; some involved fully armored looks, while others had only cloth, or a mix of cloth and armor. For airless or toxic environments, Jacob wears a small breather device, which allows for more facial expressivity. According to a former BioWare employee, Jacob was originally meant to be a bisexual romance option, and that animation work for romance scenes with Commander Shepard of both genders, ""matching shot-for-shot from Brokeback Mountain"", was completed prior to intervention from management requesting that the same sex romantic content be removed, blaming backlash from news outlets like Fox News in response to the previous game.  Jacob Taylor is voiced by Adam Lazarre-White.  Chris Thursten from PC Gamer called Jacob ""the worst companion"" and the culmination of his romance arc ""the worst moment in Mass Effect"".  Randall Ezno Randall Ezno is the protagonist of Mass Effect Infiltrator, a third-person shooter tie-in video game to Mass Effect 3 developed for mobile devices. He is a cybernetically modified Cerberus operative who discovers that his employer is up to something nefarious, goes rogue and embarks on a mission to save his friend from Cerberus.  Randall is voiced by Jay Anthony Franke.  Pathfinder Ryder Pathfinder Ryder is the main protagonist of Mass Effect: Andromeda, the fourth mainline installment of the Mass Effect series, and the child of Alec Ryder. Their twin sibling is Sara or Scott Ryder, depending on the player's chosen gender. The player can change their character's first name, but if the default names of Sara or Scott are kept, NPCs will occasionally refer to the character's first name in voiced dialogue.  The Ryder siblings are cryogenically frozen and dispatched alongside their father and tens of thousands of other colonists on a 600-year journey to the Andromeda galaxy, departing before the events of Mass Effect 3. The ark carrying the humans, the Hyperion, arrives at the wrong drop point, far from the forward command centre of the Andromeda Initiative, the Nexus, and cut off from contact with both it and the other arks. The player-controlled Ryder later succeeds their father as the Hyperion's Pathfinder, and is tasked with leading their crew on the command ship The Tempest, successfully settling the Heleus Cluster, and improving life aboard the Nexus, a galactic hub for the colonizer races from the Milky Way.  Scott and Sara Ryder are voiced by Tom Taylorson and Fryda Wolff, respectively.  Andromeda was known for its technical issues, particularly for the awkward facial animations of some of its characters; notably, the default face for Sara Ryder received negative reception from fans prior to  and after the game's launch, attracting comments such as ""It's a perfect representation of the uncanny valley"" and a ""robot-like model that had dead eyes syndrome"" prior to a patch fix released in early April 2017.  Squad members  Original trilogy  Kaidan Alenko   Kaidan Alenko is a human Alliance Navy officer with biotic powers, who serves aboard the SSV Normandy as Staff Lieutenant and head of the ship's Marine detail. In a late-game choice on the planet Virmire, the player must choose whether to save Ashley Williams or Kaidan; this choice leads to the other character's death. If Kaidan survives, he returns in a cameo in Mass Effect 2 and as a full squad member in 3, where he has been promoted to the rank of Major and commands the 1st Special Operations Biotic Company, a covert operations unit. He is later bestowed Spectre status by the council. He is a potential romance option for a female Shepard throughout the entire trilogy, and for a male Shepard only in Mass Effect 3.  Kaidan is voiced by Raphael Sbarge.  Ashley Williams   Ashley Williams is a human Alliance Marine, who becomes part of Shepard's squad during the first observed Reaper attack in the first Mass Effect. In a late-game choice on the planet Virmire, the player must choose whether to save Ashley or Kaidan Alenko; this choice leads to the other character's death. If Ashley is saved, she will return in a cameo appearance in Mass Effect 2 and as a member of Shepard's squad for Mass Effect 3, where she has attained the rank of Lieutenant Commander and commands an unspecified covert operations unit. She is later bestowed Spectre status by the council. She is a potential romance option for a male Shepard throughout the original trilogy.  Ashley Williams is voiced by Kimberly Brooks.  Garrus Vakarian   Garrus Vakarian is a male turian who serves as a squad mate in all three of the games. Garrus is initially a C-Sec officer who joins up with Shepard to escape from all the ""red tape"" in his job but becomes a vigilante under the alias Archangel on Omega in Mass Effect 2 before his squad is killed. Garrus is a potential romance option for a female Shepard in 2.  In Mass Effect 3, he leads a ""Reaper task force"" for the Turians, with the option to continue their relationship from 2 if he was Shepard's paramour. The character is also the star of the third issue of Mass Effect: Homeworlds. Garrus's blue-and-black armour colour scheme was kept consistent throughout the series, as was his visor, although grey was added in the third game to reflect his new rank.  Garrus is voiced by Brandon Keener.  Urdnot Wrex   A famous bounty hunter and mercenary, Wrex is among the last of the Krogan Battle Masters. They are rare individuals who can combine biotic abilities with advanced weaponry and tactics. He joins the crew of the SSV Normandy in the first Mass Effect to hunt the rogue Spectre Saren, but is later drawn into a stand-off with Commander Shepard in Virmire when he discovers that Saren's scientists have uncovered a cure for the genophage. Depending on the outcome, he may return in later sequels and eventually become a leader of the krogan.  Wrex is voiced by Steven Barr.  Tali'Zorah   Tali'Zorah, initially known by her full name Tali'Zorah nar Rayya, is the first quarian character to appear in the series. She is a squad mate in each of the three games. While she is known as a genius in the field of mechanical engineering. as the daughter of Admiral Rael'Zorah there is much pressure for Tali to excel. In the first game, she is on her Pilgrimage, before handing Shepard incriminating evidence about Saren and joining their crew. In the second game, now Tali'Zorah Vas Neema, where she joins Shepard on a suicide mission to rescue human colonists from the Collectors, and she is a potential romance option for a male Shepard. If she survives the suicide mission, she will appear as a squad member in Mass Effect 3, with the option to continue their relationship from 2 if she was Shepard's paramour. If Shepard sides with the geth over the quarians during the latter's attempt to retake Rannoch, she will commit suicide after witnessing the annihilation of the quarian Migrant Fleet.  Tali is voiced by Ash Sroka, also credited as ""Liz Sroka"".  Liara T'Soni   Liara T'Soni is an asari scientist, that joins Shepard's squad in the first game and appears in 2 as a non-player character (available as a temporary squad member in Mass Effect 2: Lair of the Shadow Broker) and as a full squad member in 3. She is one of the experts on Prothean history and technology. Liara is a potential romance option for Shepard throughout the entire trilogy. Following Shepard's death in Mass Effect 2, Liara gradually became emotionally hardened, and began working as an information broker, eventually leading to the events of Lair of the Shadow Broker which conclude with her becoming the new Shadow Broker.  Liara is voiced by Ali Hillis.  Miranda Lawson   Miranda Lawson is an officer of the pro-human group Cerberus, first appearing in Mass Effect Galaxy and then serving as a squad mate in Mass Effect 2. In addition to these, the character also makes an appearance in the Mass Effect: Redemption comic series and in Mass Effect 3 (provided the player does not import a save where she dies). She is revealed to have been genetically designed by her father to be perfect and ran away from home to join Cerberus. Lawson is leader of Cerberus' Lazarus Cell, tasked with reviving Commander Shepard. Aboard the Normandy SR-2, she is Shepard's second-in-command and Executive Officer, and files mission reports directly to the Illusive Man.  Miranda Lawson is voiced by and modeled after actress Yvonne Strahovski.  EDI  EDI is an AI entity who first appears in Mass Effect 2 as the Normandy SR-2's artificial intelligence and speaks with an aurally feminine voice. Her name stands for ""Enhanced Defense Intelligence"", and is visually represented on the Normandy by a holographic blue sphere. For Mass Effect 3, the developers wanted to give EDI a body that is ""sexy, chrome, and robotic"", akin to the Maria character, also known as the Maschinenmensch, from Metropolis. EDI's facial and body design went through multiple iterations, which includes an eyeless visage, and partially completed 3-D models which differ from the EDI's appearance in terms of body shape, the split between solid and transparent surfaces, and finer points of her two-tone appearance. After some discussion about how robotic would the extent of her appearance be, the team decided that the body she would come to possess is an infiltration unit, which once had skin over its metal frame and is capable of the same facial effects as a living human being to avoid being easily spotted.  Mass Effect 2 establishes that EDI's highly advanced nature is a result of modifications achieved with technology salvaged from the Reaper Sovereign. She is initially ""shackled"" with programming which inhibits her decision making, until it was later removed by Joker. In Mass Effect 3, Shepard's team recovers a Cerberus infiltration unit named Eva to be analyzed after an incident at the Mars research station. EDI assists in doing so, and in the process, struggles with the synthetic entity and eventually seizes control of its platform in the process, allowing her to accompany Shepard as a squad mate on missions. Now possessing a physical body with humanlike characteristics, her relationship with Joker develops further, and, if Shepard supports the idea, the two may start a romantic relationship. She often asks Shepard about the context and nature of human behaviour so that she can better understand human psychology and, in a sense, taking on more human traits herself. During the Alliance raid on Cerberus Headquarters, a Cerberus report discovered in the base retroactively establishes EDI's original identity as a rogue VI which somehow achieved sentience and took over an Alliance training ground located on Earth's moon during an optional mission of the first Mass Effect game. If Shepard chooses to control the Reapers or the synthesis of all organic and synthetic life at the conclusion of the game, EDI will be present in the ending cutscene alongside Joker.  EDI is voiced by Tricia Helfer.  PC Gamer praised EDI's characterization, noting that she ""might have had some fine dialogue and ruminations on what it means to be human"". EDI is also included in PC Gamer's definitive list of the best squad mates around, citing her utility as a solid fighter and being an actual spaceship. GameRevolution included EDI in their list of ""Women Who Rock Modern Gaming""; praise was focused on her unique contribution to the squad dynamic in Mass Effect 3 with her new body, her inexperience in interacting with humanity which often leads to humorous situations, as well as her integration into the game's main plot during the final act of the game. On the other hand, Wes Fenlon indicated in his articles written for PC Gamer and Gamesradar that he was disturbed by BioWare's decision to give EDI a sexy robot body, and involving the character in a romance subplot with Joker. Stacey Henley from TheGamer also disapproved of EDI's costume design in Mass Effect 3, and criticized the sexualization of the character's physical appearance as not only unnecessary, but also uncomfortable as it detracts from her role in Mass Effect 3s team dynamic, as well as her ""brilliant"" characterization which Henley summarized as ""engaging, philosophical, layered"".  Mordin Solus   Mordin Solus is a salarian scientist who possesses a hyperactive and eccentric personality, a rapid and stilted manner of speaking, and  a flawless autobiographical and eidetic memory which is a typical salarians trait. He is a key member in the science team that researched the remodification of the Krogan Genophage, an action that he initially considered the best possible solution to a once growing problem, as he believes in acting in the best interests of the galaxy.  The character returns in Mass Effect 3, providing he survives the suicide mission in Mass Effect 2; otherwise, another salarian scientist named Padok Wiks fulfills Mordin's role within the narrative. Mordin is encountered on the salarian homeworld, Sur'Kesh, when Shepard is sent there to aid in the evacuation of a fertile female krogan codenamed Eve, the only survivor of his student Maelon's experiments. If Maelon's research data was saved in the previous game, he uses it to aid in Eve's treatment and produce a viable cure for the Genophage.  Mordin Solus is voiced by Michael Beattie in Mass Effect 2, and by William Salyers in Mass Effect 3.  Jack   Jack, also known as Jacqueline Nought or ""Subject Zero"", is the powerful product of unethical Cerberus experiments to enhance human biotic ability, which molded her antisocial temperament. Shepard may recruit Jack from the prison facility that she is confined in to join the suicide mission against the Collectors, in exchange for files aboard the Normandy about the science facility where Cerberus scientists tortured and abused her. She is a potential romance option for a male Shepard in Mass Effect 2. Jack reappears in Mass Effect 3 if a save game is imported where she survives the events of the suicide mission, with the option to continue their relationship from 2 if she was Shepard's paramour.  Jack is voiced by Courtenay Taylor.  Grunt Grunt is a tank-bred genetically engineered super-krogan that can be recruited as a squad member. Grunt's design is intended to be youthful but also tough, invoking the look of a linebacker with large shoulder pads and exposed muscular arms. Compared to Wrex who is a much older krogan, Grunt's crest is smaller and does not fully cover his entire skull due to his age. Early designs for Grunt's armor varied widely, which eventually settled into a polished and sleek look, almost like a ""show-room finish"" on a brand new car. A confrontation scene in Mass Effect 2 between Grunt and Mordin over the latter's role in strengthening the Genophage was planned but ultimately cut during development.  Initially in Mass Effect 2, Shepard is meant to recruit Okeer, a krogan warlord and radical scientist who has been developing a small army of krogan to weather the Genophage. When Shepard arrives to recruit him, Okeer is working for the Blue Suns mercenary group, but was betrayed by the latter. Though Shepard and crew defeat the Blue Suns leader, it is too late to save Okeer, who leaves Shepard with a tank containing his ""legacy"", his ""perfect krogan"". If and when Shepard decides to awaken him, the krogan recalls Okeer's last words and chooses one of them, ""grunt"", as his name. While initially hostile towards Shepard, Grunt may be recruited as a squad mate. He comes to respect Shepard's leadership, partly because Shepard faces great battles and has powerful enemies. If Grunt becomes loyal, he declares Shepard his battlemaster. If the player imports a save game where Grunt survives the suicide mission in 2, he appears in Mass Effect 3 in a small role.  Grunt is voiced by Steve Blum.  Grunt showing Shepard his strength in Mass Effect 2 is considered to be one of the original trilogy's most iconic moments by Kotaku's Gergo Vas.PC Gamer staff noted that while there is not much to the character ""beyond punching things and talking about fighting"", dealing with Grunt could be a ""refreshing change from the philosophizing and soul-searching of the rest of the crew.""  Thane Krios  Thane is a mysterious drell assassin who is terminally ill from a disease known as Kepral's Syndrome, which is exclusive to drell due to their physiology. While a coldblooded killer, Thane possesses a conscience that struggles against his own profession. Shepard may recruit him on the asari-dominated world of Ilium for the suicide mission in Mass Effect 2. At the time of his recruitment, Thane states he has nothing left to lose, and he hopes to right many wrongs he has found in the galaxy before his death. Thane Krios is a possible romantic interest for a female Shepard.  Thane returns in Mass Effect 3 provided he survived the suicide mission in Mass Effect 2. Thane may play a role in the narrative depending on the player's prior decisions, but will ultimately succumb to his wounds from Kai Leng if he plays a role in preventing the assassination of a Citadel councilor, or to Kepral's Syndrome.  Thane Krios is voiced by Keythe Farley.  Samara  Samara is an Asari Justicar, a member of a highly respected and feared ascetic order of mystic warriors. Samara is on a quest to track down her fugitive daughter Morinth, who is a biological deviant known as an Ardat-Yakshi. Shepard meets Samara on Illium, where she is found investigating the Eclipse mercenary group who smuggled her daughter off-world. Samara will join Shepard for the suicide mission at the conclusion of the investigation; if Shepard chooses to participate in her quest, a decision has to be made between siding with Samara or Morinth at the climax of the story arc. If the player imports a save game where Samara survives the events of Mass Effect 2, she returns in a small role in Mass Effect 3 where she is encountered by Shepard at an Ardat-Yakshi monastery; confronted by a duty to comply with the Justicar Code by executing her only living child, who is also Ardat-Yakshi like Morinth and forbidden from leaving an asari monastery, she will attempt to commit suicide unless Shepard stops her.  Samara is voiced by Maggie Baird, while Rana McAnear provides her likeness.  Morinth Morinth is the fugitive daughter of Samara. She is an Ardat-Yakshi, asari who are born with an inherited trait which kills their mates during sexual encounters by burning out their nervous systems. Morinth joins Shepard's squad in Mass Effect 2 if she is assisted with trapping and killing Samara. She will then disguise herself as her mother and takes up residence at Samara's quarters on board The Normandy, so that only Shepard knows of Samara's death. Shepard may choose to mate with Morinth, although it will result in his or her death. If the player imports a save game where Morinth is recruited and survives the events of Mass Effect 2, she will appear in Mass Effect 3 as an indoctrinated husk-like enemy type known as a banshee.  Morinth is voiced by Natalia Cigliuti. Her face was modeled after Rana McAnear. Morinth originally had a different face and character model and could not pass as Samara, and that Shepard would have had to either disclose the truth about Samara's fate to the rest of the crew or lie to them. Unlike most other squadmates in Mass Effect who had more complete arcs, Morinth only has two full-fledged conversations with Shepard, which mainly deals with her backstory with Samara and her experiences growing up as an Ardat-Yakshi. Morinth's planned dialogue options were trimmed down due to scope reasons and time constraints encountered during development, and the team opted to give the character an appearance which is identical to Samara, instead of cutting her from the game completely.  Video game developer Brian Kindregan, who wrote Morinth for Mass Effect 2, described her as a free spirit, a character who decides her own destiny and flaunt society's rules even if others are harmed in the process. To explore the dark underside of sapient or sentient beings that Morinth is drawn to, the decision was made to shift her original role from the leader of an underground cult to a hedonistic sexual predator who prowls for victims at a nightclub on Omega space station. Inspired by nightclub scenes depicted in Blade and The Matrix, Kindregan wanted to convey the feeling of an ""alternative culture just underneath the surface of one, and one that represents hedonism but also a slightly scary, predatory feel."" Kindregan emphasized that the mission was not intended to be social commentary on drugs and nightclubs, but rather the underlying concepts they represent in fiction, as nightclubs in his view represent ""unbridled human impulse and desire"" and material excess by privileged youth similar in spirit to the symbolism presented by the depiction of jungles and wild nature in Heart of Darkness.""  Unlike most other levels in Mass Effect 2, Morinth's nightclub scene does not involve any combat sequences; instead, it entirely revolves around a story-driven gameplay mechanic Kindregan called a ""puzzle conversation"". Kindregan said it is difficult to write and implement a puzzle conversation as the player is supposed to be able to intuit the correct answers by interpreting Morinth's facial expressions and body language, and that he had considered incorporating a ""safety valve"" at the beginning of the mission for the benefit for the player, which would have served as a foolproof way to acquire all the correct answers to the conversation and complete the mission. Kindregan credited the positive feedback for the mission to the success of the final product's narrative and design as well as his teamwork with senior level senior level designer Dusty Evermore.  PC Gamer staff considers Morinth to be a poor replacement for her mother, ""the more interesting and conflicted justicar"". She is rated better as an antagonist instead, the ""cat-and-mouse game of catching Morinth"" being lauded as one of Mass Effect 2's most exciting moments. András Neltz from Kotaku commented that ""the sheer audacity of a scam this huge—setting out to recruit a virtuous Asari Justicar, and coming back with her black widow of a daughter instead, passing her off as the real thing—is truly amazing.""  Legion   Legion is the name, inspired by the ""Gospel of Mark 5:9 – Exorcism of the Gerasene demoniac"", given to the gestalt intelligence hosted within a geth mobile unit eleven times more powerful than standard geth mobile platforms. Legion belongs to the true Geth Consensus, and is designed to operate outside of geth space and interact diplomatically with organic lifeforms. In contrast to other Geth, Legion is capable of independent thought, and demonstrates emotional attachment as they are particularly fascinated with Shepard.  Legion is voiced by D. C. Douglas.  Zaeed Massani  Zaeed is a human bounty hunter who is integrated into Mass Effect 2 through the DLC pack Zaeed - The Price of Revenge and later as part of the Mass Effect Legendary Edition compilation. He holds the reputation as the galaxy's most feared bounty hunter and co-founder of the Blue Suns mercenary group. Unlike most other characters, Zaeed joins Shepard's squad as soon as he is spoken to, and only tells short stories when conversed with. For his loyalty mission, he asks that Shepard help his vendetta against the Blue Suns' other co-founder, Vido Santiago. If the player imports a save game where Zaeed survives the events of 2, Zaeed returns in Mass Effect 3 with a small role.  Originally cut from the base game due to budget and time constraints, the Zaeed - The Price of Revenge DLC allowed the character's writer Jay Turner to repurpose unused content and use the constraints as a core part of his character. As Zaeed's loyalty mission is the only opportunity for players to get to know him, Turner had to ensure that all aspects of the character, ""from his dialogue to the identity of the villain to the events along the way"" must speak to his personality and backstory. To establish a simple but compelling motive for him, Turner pitched Zaeed's loyalty mission as one based on revenge, with his personality shaped into that of a grizzled survivor who has endured all kinds of death-defying situations with the stories and scars to prove it. Turner intended Zaeed to be an exploration of the themes of PTSD and trauma, and also as a ruthless antithesis to the ""BioWare Paladin"" archetype who is willing to complete his mission at all costs. Zaeed initially had a mechanic leg and a dog companion during early concept stages. Head models for the character went through various iterations, which included scarring, tattoos with the Blue Suns insignia, and potential breathers inspired by hocket masks and welding helmets for intimidation purposes.  Zaeed is voiced by Robin Sachs.  PC Gamer staff member Wes Fenlon calling Zaeed a ""less interesting retread of KotOR's Mandalorian Canderous Ordo"" and expressed doubt about his ineffectiveness as a squad mate.  Kasumi Goto   Kasumi is a human master thief who is integrated into Mass Effect 2 through the DLC pack, Kasumi – Stolen Memory and later as part of the Mass Effect Legendary Edition compilation. The character's core concept is “the best thief in the galaxy”. Unlike other characters, Kasumi does not have a recruitment mission and joins Shepard's squad as soon as she is spoken to, only making brief remarks or observations when interacted with. For her loyalty mission, Kasumi requests Shepard's help in retrieving the memory box of her dead lover Keiji Okuda. Kasumi returns in Mass Effect 3 with a small role, provided a save game is imported where her eponymous DLC was played and she survives the suicide mission.  Originally cut from the base game, Kasumi allowed the character's writer Jay Turner the chance to provide a ""glimpse into a wild underground where there are art heists and Bond villains and respect among thieves"" in Mass Effect 2. Turner wrote Kasumi's personality to be ""irreverent and quirky and confident"", with the intention to position her as Shepard's ""best friend"" as opposed to being yet another female character who Shepard could romance or sleep with. Describing Kasumi as his favorite character, Turner thought of her as a cheerful change from the game's often serious and severe tone. Kasumi presented Turner with an opportunity to explore the series' tropes from a different angle as she comments on Shepard's world from the perspective of an outsider who is a master of her world, one which is unfamiliar to Shepard. Turner compared her to the Batman character, in that she is always prepared and composed for any given situation, in spite of her flighty or flippant demeanor. Kasumi's visual design drew inspiration from Middle Eastern culture; her outfit echoes that of a typical thief from the European Middle Ages, the hood in particular gives her a mysterious and stealthy look.  Kasumi Goto is voiced by Kym Hoy. Hoy noted that Kasumi's cultural background is specifically stated to be of Japanese descent, and that the casting call required a candidate who could carry the mystique of an elusive personality along with projecting a vaguely Asian-sounding accent. With the guidance of her voiceover directors, Hoy made necessary preparations to develop a blend of Japanese and British English accents for Kasumi's soft-spoken voice; as she wanted a little mystery surrounding where Kasumi is truly from, she was mindful about not making the accent overly modern-sounding and not too precise. Hoy credits her past experience in performing ethnic Asian characters as well as her classical theatre and singing training for her ability to perform Kasumi's accent at a consistent pace, and ensuring the character sounds natural in terms of timing and delivery without it becoming a caricature. Hoy noted that while BioWare had specifications about how they wanted the character to sound like, with ""1940s movie star sass"" being an ideal, they were also open to feedback and questions from her about the development of the character's personality.  PC Gamer staff praised Kasumi as one of more visually interesting Mass Effect squad mates. IGN's Steven Hopper ranked Kasumi #9 in his list of best Mass Effect teammates.  James Vega  Lieutenant James Vega is a human Systems Alliance Marine and Shepard's squad member in Mass Effect 3. James is tasked to escort Shepard to an Alliance defense committee hearing, however the hearing is interrupted when the Reapers attack Earth. James and Ashley or Kaidan, depending on who survived Virmire, retrieve the Normandy SR-2 and pick Shepard up from Earth. James is the main focus of the  anime film, Mass Effect: Paragon Lost.  James Vega is voiced by Freddie Prinze, Jr. in all media.  Javik Javik is the endling of the Prothean race, and is only available if the Mass Effect 3: From Ashes DLC is installed. His stasis pod is uncovered and opened by Commander Shepard and Liara T'Soni during his recruitment mission, who were investigating Cerberus activity on the human colony of Eden Prime. Flashbacks of Javik's memories happen during the mission which reveals insights on the Prothean's struggle against the Reapers. Javik reacted with shock that he had awaken after 50,000 years and everything he knew was gone, but agrees to join Shepard to stop the Reapers no matter the cost.  The Protheans were first depicted in the form of visually ambiguous statues on the planet Ilos in the first game, as at the time BioWare was unsure as to the extent of the role the Protheans would play over the course of the original trilogy. Javik's final design is based on the look of the Collectors from Mass Effect 2, particularly the shell shape of the head which is a signature feature of the Collectors, along with multiple pupils to the eyes and secondary nostrils to evoke a very alien feel. As the Protheans of his time were known for their highly advanced technological capabilities, Javik is intended to look more intelligent than a mindless Collector drone. Javik's armor, which is influenced by the aesthetics of samurai armor, is intended to be technologically advanced yet with an ancient feel, thematically appropriate for a being who had been placed in stasis for over 50,000 years.  Javik is voiced by Ike Amadi.  Mass Effect: Andromeda  Cora Harper Cora Harper is a human biotic commando and operations specialist in charge of the Pathfinder team's ground missions. She began a career in the Alliance military, before serving with an asari commando unit as part of a Council inter-species integration scheme. She is second-in-command of the human Pathfinder team and meant to be Alec Ryder's appointed successor as Pathfinder. Cora is a romance option for a male Pathfinder.  Cora is voiced by Jules de Jongh.  Liam Kosta Liam Kosta is a human security and crisis response specialist for the Pathfinder team, and was “hand-picked” by Alec Ryder due to his multidisciplinary skills. Liam is a romance option for a female Pathfinder.  Liam is voiced by Gary Carr.  Vetra Nyx Vetra Nyx is from the turian homeworld of Palaven and a well traveled drifter, who at some point ""drifted into the wrong crowd"". She has well honed street smarts and adaptability from years of working with smugglers and mercenaries, and is fiercely loyal once her trust is earned. Vetra is a romance option for a Pathfinder of either gender.   Vetra is voiced by Danielle Rayne.  Pelessaria ""Peebee"" B'Sayle Pelessaria B'Sayle, better known by her nickname Peebee is a rogue-ish young academic from Port Lerama, capital of the planet Hyetiana, a hub for asari science and education. She has developed an obsessive interest in studying the Remnant, an umbrella term coined for technology, structures, and autonomous bots that have been sighted across the Heleus Cluster. She is considered to be an atypical member of asari culture, “pathologically independent”, and has little regard for rules or teamwork. She is rivals with Kalinda, another asari who competes with Peebee in her search for Remnant technology. Peebee is a romance option for a Pathfinder of either gender.  Peebee is voiced by Christine Lakin.  Nakmor Drack Nakmor Drack is a veteran krogan warrior who has well over 1,400 years of life experience as a soldier, mercenary, and occasional pirate in the Milky Way galaxy. He is vocal about the genophage and the Citadel community's treatment of his species. Unlike other members of the Nakmor clan, he is loyal to the Nexus, the seat of government and power for the Andromeda Initiative, and to his granddaughter, Nakmor Kesh. Drack's preferred weapon is a ""Ruzad"" shotgun, and his favorite ability is Blood Rage, which ""enhances his melee damage, damage resistance, and health regeneration"".  Drack is voiced by Stanley Townsend.  Jaal Ama Darav Jaal Ama Darav is a high-ranking member of the Angaran Resistance who are at war with the kett, and joins the Pathfinder's team as a liaison between the Andromeda Initiative and the resistance fighters. Jaal's preferred weapon is a sniper rifle. Jaal was initially a romance option for a female player character only, and was an early fan favorite among Andromeda's new cast of characters. A patch  for the game released in June 2017 made Jaal available as a potential romance option for a male player character.  Jaal is voiced by Nyasha Hatendi.  Major antagonists  The Reapers  The Reapers are a highly advanced machine race of synthetic-organic starships residing in dark space: the vast, mostly starless space between galaxies. They hibernate and remain dormant for a cycle of fifty thousand years, before returning to the Milky Way galaxy and harvest all sentient organic life. The Reapers and their various agents are the overarching antagonists of the original trilogy.  Saren Arterius Saren Arterius is a turian Spectre, an elite operative who represented the Citadel Council and operated above the law, and one of the two main antagonists of the first Mass Effect game . Saren was originally designed as an older, weaker character who is a powerful biotic. Saren's head design went through several iterations: the team experimented with structure, scarring, and decorations. His final appearance is similar to other turians but with a distinctive crest, and a lack of tattoos unlike most of his kind. It was intended for the character to show signs of severe indoctrination, yet does not look like an obvious monstrosity and is still able to blend into society. The character's final design incorporates a mechanical arm and some visible cybernetic features to reflect Reaper indoctrination.  He first appears in the novel Mass Effect: Revelation, which takes place 18 years before to the events of Mass Effect and before he was indoctrinated and working with Sovereign. Saren later takes command of a dissident geth faction through the use of a Reaper known as Sovereign. With a machine army at his command, he uses them to both do his bidding and oppose Shepard across the story of the Mass Effect video game. Saren's main base is situated on the planet Virmire, where he is conducting experiments such as a cure for the Krogan Genophage to bolster his army. Throughout the course of the game, the Reaper slowly began to manipulate Saren through subtle subliminal messages into helping it bring back the Reapers. During the geth invasion of the Citadel, Saren uses the Prothean Conduit to gain access to the Citadel to allow Sovereign to activate the Citadel mass relay. The player can then either attempt to kill Saren or appeal to Saren to fight his indoctrination, which if successful will prompt him to commit suicide. Shepard later has to fight a revived and mutated Saren, who is possessed by Sovereign through his grafted cybernetics. Upon defeat of the Sovereign-manipulated Saren, Sovereign itself loses its defenses and is destroyed.  IGN included the moment Saren commits suicide in their list of 13 Best Mass Effect Moments.  Saren is voiced by Fred Tatasciore.  Matriarch Benezia Matriarch Benezia is the mother of Liara T'Soni, and was a highly regarded spiritual leader among the asari until she was mind controlled by the Reaper Sovereign and forced to become Saren's second in command. Her appearance is intended to capture the beauty and mystical power of the asari, and also to associate her with Saren's malevolence through its darker and more enigmatic qualities. The design of her headdress references religious and royal clothing.  In Mass Effect Shepard travels to the planet Noveria and confronts Benezia, discovering that she has found and captured a surviving queen of the rachni. Benezia intends to use the rachni queen to breed an army of rachni to fight Saren's enemies. Although Benezia has a lucid moment during their fight, where she reveals the next phase of Saren's plans and warns Shepard about Sovereign's corrupting influence, Shepard has to fight her to the death after she completely succumbs to the indoctrination.  Matriarch Benezia is voiced by Marina Sirtis.  Donnel Udina Donnel Udina first appears in the original Mass Effect as the human ambassador based in the Citadel. Udina is depicted as self-serving politician who has an antagonistic relationship with Shepard and their mentor David Anderson throughout the original trilogy. By the events of Mass Effect 3, he is the representative for humanity in the Citadel Council, regardless of the player's choice in the ending of the first game. Later in 3, Udina allies with Cerberus to stage a coup in a desperate attempt to overthrow his fellow Councillors as part of his plan to prioritize the liberation of planet Earth from the Reapers, but he is killed when the coup fails.  Donnell Udina is voiced by Bill Ratner.  The Thorian The Thorian, also called Species 37, is an ancient sentient fungal creature tens of thousands of years old, with unique mind-controlling and telepathic abilities, the ability to create clone duplicates of a being it has absorbed, and a massive sensory network stretching over the surface of the planet Feros. It releases spores into the air that infect those who inhale them, and uses pain to control the behavior of its thralls. In Mass Effect, the Thorian encounters Shiala, an asari and former acolyte of Matriarch Benezia who had been absorbed by the Thorian, which used clone duplicates of her as an avatar to interact with Shepard's team. Shiala will be set free after the Thorian is killed, and she grants Shepard the Prothean cipher which enables the mental decryption of the mental message transmitted from the Prothean beacon. Shepard has the choice to either spare or execute her.  Cerberus   Cerberus, an anthropocentric group advocating militarism and a ""humanity-first"" supremacist agenda, appears as recurring antagonists in the series. Cerberus is founded and led by the Illusive Man, voiced by Martin Sheen. Cerberus forms an alliance with Commander Shepard against the human-abducting Collectors in Mass Effect 2, whereas in Mass Effect 3 they work against Shepard's attempts to destroy the Reapers, as the Illusive Man wishes to control them instead. The organization experienced numerous defections between the events of Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3, including operatives who specialize in close combat electric whips.  Megan Logan from Inverse praised the depiction of Cerberus in the series as a villainous entity, and opined that ""nuanced complexity built upon an understandable motivation is what makes a compelling antagonist"".  Kai Leng Kai Leng is a former lieutenant N7 marine and Cerberus assassin, who first appears in the novel Mass Effect: Retribution, as well as its subsequent sequels. Kai Leng is the Illusive Man's most trusted agent, who used him as his best infiltration and wet-work operative for over a decade, and appears in Mass Effect 3 as one of the game's main antagonists. He wears a coat similar to Thane's over a uniform with Cerberus colors, and his face and body is equipped with visible cybernetic implants to compensate for the injuries he sustained in Retribution courtesy of David Anderson. Early direction of Kai Leng's concept involve inhuman-looking metallic legs and hard armor as upgrades, which were streamlined during the later period of the development cycle of 3 into a stealthier appearance along with his hairstyle, coat length and visor type.  In Mass Effect 3 he was among the forces deployed during Udina's coup on the Citadel Council, and will succeed in assassinating the salarian councilor unless Thane Krios or Kirrahe are available in Mass Effect 3 to intervene. Kai Leng is next encountered on the asari homeworld Thessia, where he successfully claims an ancient Prothean-made VI from the asari on the Illusive Man's orders. Shepard's final encounter with Kai Leng is in the Illusive Man's observation deck on Cronos Station, the Cerberus headquarters. Despite his lethal skills, he is unable to overwhelm Shepard, and is wounded. He later retrieves his blade and makes a final attempt to kill the Commander from behind. At that moment, Shepard detects him and counters his attack, finishing him off with an omni-blade.  Kai Leng is voiced by Troy Baker.  Kai Leng's execution by Shepard is considered to be one of the original trilogy's most iconic moments by Kotaku's Gergo Vas, and one of the 13 best Mass Effect Moments by IGN.  Oleg Petrovsky Oleg Petrovsky is a general of Cerberus' armed forces, who first appears in the comic Mass Effect: Invasion, where he seizes control of the Omega space station from Aria T'Loak using adjutants, a type of husk-like creature engineered by Cerberus through co-opting Reaper technology. He makes his first video game appearance as the main antagonist of the Mass Effect 3 DLC Omega.  The Collectors The Collectors are mysterious aliens first mentioned in the 2008 novel Mass Effect: Ascension, who are known to trade hyper-advanced technology in exchange for living beings from various species. They were widely dismissed as myths within the Mass Effect universe, but are in fact the deformed versions of the original Prothean race. Prior to the events of Mass Effect 2, all known expeditions to investigate the Collectors failed, and no vessel that ventured to their space beyond Omega 4 Relay ever returned save those of the Collectors themselves. Led by a Collector General, a unique being who controls the rest of the Collectors from their base beyond the Omega Four mass relay, they collect humans by incapacitating them using flying insect-like ""seeker swarms"" to create a new Reaper on their masters' behest following Sovereign's defeat and destruction at the end of the first game. The Collectors are assisted by a variety of husk units made from Reaper technology, with some created from multiple husks strung together in a grotesque manner such as Scions who provide ranged fire support with their arm cannons, as well as large floating monstrosities called Praetorians. The Collectors' look is based on crabs and microscopic closeups of insect species like beetles and mosquitoes. The Collectors were initially envisioned as robed walking bipedal aliens for a dark, cultlike feel; as Collector soldier units had to fulfill in-game combat mechanic requirements, their design shifted to a more humanoid appearance, while the Collector General has multiple limbs that resemble arthropod legs.  András Neltz from Kotaku consider the Collectors to be tragic figures, and ""a demonstration of what evil the Reapers are capable of; a twisted shadow of a once-proud race, forced to serve the ones who destroyed them.""  The Shadow Broker The Shadow Broker is the elusive and enigmatic head of an expansive organization which trades in data and information, always selling to the highest bidder. The Shadow Broker's identity is unknown to the general public and always operates through an agent. For the Shadow Broker's design, two disparate concepts were combined: that of the galaxy's greatest information broker whose suit evokes a mob boss look and is fully integrated into the galactic community, as well as that of an unfamiliar alien and a frighteningly inhuman challenge for Shepard. The Broker's final facial design, with his triangular mouth and multiple eyes, is unlike anything BioWare has done in the past, and custom work had to be done to animate his face properly as Mass Effect 2 digital-acting system could not handle the graphical stress.  In Mass Effect Tali wanted to trade evidence incriminating Saren to the Shadow Broker in exchange for a safe place to hide; the Broker sends a thug named Fist to deal with her, although he later dispatches Wrex to eliminate Fist, who had turned traitor. Other notable agents of the Broker include the volus financial adviser Barla Von, and Wilson, Miranda Lawson's assistant in the Lazarus Project who joins Shepard as a temporary squad mate on Lazarus Station in Mass Effect 2. Following the events of Mass Effect: Redemption, Liara pursues the Shadow Broker for revenge over her friend Feron's imprisonment and torture. In Mass Effect 2: Lair of the Shadow Broker, Liara survives an assassination attempt by an agent of the Broker, a rogue asari Spectre named Tela Vasir. She then travels to the Shadow Broker Base on the planet Hagalaz with Shepard, where they confront the Shadow Broker, who is revealed to be a member of a pre-spaceflight race called the yahg. They killed the Broker following a boss fight, and Liara succeeds him as the new Shadow Broker.  Shepard's meeting and confrontation with the Shadow Broker is considered to be one of the original trilogy's most iconic moments by Kotaku's Gergo Vas, and one of the 13 best Mass Effect Moments by IGN.  Dr. Amanda Kenson Dr. Amanda Kenson is a human scientist known for her groundbreaking discoveries on the origins of the mass relays. She appears as a deep cover agent in the Mass Effect 2 DLC Arrival, and is saved from batarian captivity by Shepard on her friend Admiral Hackett's behest. She claims to have found evidence of an imminent Reaper invasion, revealing that her team have set a massive asteroid to collide into a mass relay located within the Bahak system in batarian space in order to slow the Reapers' arrival. After her entire team is revealed to have been indoctrinated by the Reapers, Shepard has to stop Dr. Kenson from interrupting the asteroid's course, which culminates in Dr. Kenson killing herself after detonating an explosive device. If the player imports a save where the Arrival DLC is completed, Shepard's action of facilitating the destruction of the Bahak system's mass relay in order to delay the Reapers' invasion resulted in the loss of over 300,000 batarian lives, which leads to their imprisonment and impending trial in the beginning of Mass Effect 3.  Maya Brooks Maya Brooks is the alias of a former Cerberus operative who serves as the main antagonist of the story campaign of the Mass Effect 3 DLC Citadel; she initially presents herself to Shepard as a Systems Alliance staff analyst. She is also responsible for sabotaging Lazarus Station, which housed the Lazarus Project that brought Shepard back from the dead, in order to steal a dormant clone of Shepard. Her actions led to the sequence of events following Shepard's awakening from a coma in Mass Effect 2. She later appears in Mass Effect: Foundation, a 13-issue comic book series starring most of Shepard's squad mates in the original trilogy, which is framed as reconnaissance by Brooks as the point-of-view character.  The Kett The kett are a hostile militaristic species with dense formations of bone growing externally as armor protrusions on their bodies. They serve as the main antagonists of Mass Effect Andromeda. The kett are led by the Archon, who is voiced by Robert Kazinsky.  Other characters  Original trilogy  David Anderson Captain David Edward Anderson is a protagonist of the novel Mass Effect: Revelation, an experienced N7 marine and Commander Shepard's mentor throughout the Mass Effect trilogy. He is also the love interest of Kahlee Sanders. In the first game he was relieved of command of the SSV Normandy by Donnel Udina, and the starship was transferred to Shepard's command. By the events of Mass Effect 3 he is promoted to the rank of Admiral, and joins Shepard as a temporary squad mate early in the game during the early stages of the Reaper invasion. He appears dressed for battle in fatigues that would not reflect his rank but also wouldn't look out of place in a battlefield.  Anderson is voiced by Keith David.  IGN included the Finale in Mass Effect 3, where Shepard shares an emotional scene with Anderson and the Illusive man, in their list of 13 Best Mass Effect Moments.  Kahlee Sanders Kahlee Sanders is a protagonist of Mass Effect: Revelation and its sequels, Ascension, Retribution, and Deception She is cited as one of the most important characters in the series, and the main heroine of Mass Effect spin-off fiction. She makes her first video game appearance in Mass Effect 3 as a staff member of the Grissom Academy.  Dr. Chakwas Dr. Karin Chakwas is a recurring character in the Mass Effect series as the human doctor of the SSV Normandy, and later the Normandy SR-2. Dr. Chakwas survives the destruction of the SSV Normandy in Mass Effect 2, and later accepts Cerberus' offer to join Shepard in their fight against the Collectors, getting a position on the Normandy SR-2 as the ship's Chief Medical Officer. Dr. Chakwas returns in Mass Effect 3, provided she survives the suicide mission in Mass Effect 2. She may be recruited back to the Normandy, or be convinced to stay at the Citadel and assist in the war effort.  Dr. Chakwas is voiced by Carolyn Seymour.  Richard L. Jenkins Corporal Richard L. Jenkins is an Alliance Marine from the rural world of Eden Prime under the command of Captain Anderson, and a member of the SSV Normandy's crew. He joins Shepard as a squadmate during their incursion to his homeworld in Mass Effect, where he is killed shortly afterwards. He is based on the Leeroy Jenkins character.  Conrad Verner Conrad Verner is a human fanatic who is obsessed with Commander Shepard. András Neltz from Kotaku notes that he is a ""crazy fan archetype taken to the next level"", and an example of a character whose personality and fate could be shaped by the player throughout the original trilogy depending on how their player character reacts to Verner's antics.  Khalisah al-Jilani Khalisah bint sinan al-Jilani is a human reporter from Westerlund News. She appears in all three games as a reporter who employs a belligerent  line of questioning whenever she is granted an opportunity to interview Shepard. She also appears in Mass Effect Andromeda: Initiation, a prequel novel to Mass Effect: Andromeda.  IGN included the running gag where Shepard can prematurely end their interview sessions with al-Jilani by punching her as a renegade action throughout the original trilogy in their list of 13 Best Mass Effect Moments. Beth Elderkin of Gizmodo referred to the aforementioned running gag as the ""Al-Jilani Saga"" and one of her favorite moments.  Administrator Anoleis  Administrator Bel Anoleis manages Port Hanshan, the capital of the planet Noveria, in the first Mass Effect. In order to obtain a garage pass to leave the port, Shepard could either prove the salarian bureaucrat's corruption to an undercover investigator named Gianna Parasini, side with Anoleis and turn over all the evidence to him, or pit Anoleis and Parasini against each other which leads to both of their deaths. András Neltz from Kotaku noted that the mission dealing with Anoleis was one of the most complex ones in the first game, and it was an early example ""showing how differently the story can go depending on the player's decisions"".  Captain Kirrahe  Captain Kirrahe was the Salarian Special Tasks Group (STG) intelligence officer who uncovered Saren's facility on Virmire, and fights alongside Shepard's squad during the assault. Kirrahe's determination to destroy Saren's base, and thus the cure with it, causes a rift between Shepard and Wrex which may be resolved by the player in a number of ways. If he survives the battle, he will be promoted to Major and appears in Mass Effect 3 as an ally at various instances. Kirrahe's speech amidst a thunderstorm in Mass Effect is considered to be one of the original trilogy's most iconic moments by Kotaku's Gergo Vas.  Steven Hackett Admiral Steven Hackett is a high-ranking official of the Earth Systems Alliance Navy's Fifth Fleet. He first appears as a minor character in Mass Effect who commands the Systems Alliance reinforcements which arrive to assist in the defense during the attack on the Citadel by Sovereign and the geth. During the course of the battle, he will defer to Shepard's wishes to either save the Citadel Councillors aboard the asari dreadnought the Destiny Ascension, or press the attack on Sovereign's forces. After the battle, he is promoted to head of the Alliance Navy. By the events of Mass Effect 3, he leads the entire Alliance forces in their struggle against the Reaper invasion.  Hackett is voiced by Lance Henriksen.  Kelly Chambers Kelly Chambers is Shepard's yeoman on the Normandy SR-2 in Mass Effect 2 whose primary role is administrative and clerical work. She keeps Commander Shepard notified of new e-mails and pass on meeting requests from Shepard's squad mates. In addition, Kelly utilizes her degree in psychology to provides counseling support and monitors the psychological state of Shepard and the crew. She is a romance option for a male or female Shepard, but does not grant the ""Paramour"" achievement. If she survives the suicide mission in Mass Effect 2, she will appear in Mass Effect 3. She informs Shepard that she is on the run from Cerberus, her former employers. Shepard may ask her to continue assisting with the war effort, or go into hiding.  Patrick Lee from AV Club brought up Chambers' potential fate in Mass Effect 3 as an example where a Paragon-aligned Shepard is ""not a saintly warrior-poet whose every decision is ethically and practically airtight"".  Aria T'Loak Aria T'Loak, also known as ""the Pirate Queen"", is an asari organized crime boss who serves as the de facto ruler of Omega Station, an important hub in the lawless Terminus Systems. She owns the Afterlife Club, which serves as the station's central hub. Her first chronological appearance is in Mass Effect: Incursion, an 8-page prequel comic to Mass Effect 2. She then makes a cameo in Mass Effect: Redemption, briefly assisting Liara's search for the missing Shepard. In Mass Effect 2, Aria provides Shepard with information on Omega. She then appears in Mass Effect: Retribution, and in the Mass Effect 3 DLC Omega, she appears as a temporary squad mate who wields powerful biotic abilities.  Aria T'Loak is voiced by Carrie-Anne Moss.  Armando-Owen Bailey  Captain Armando-Owen Bailey is a human C-Sec officer stationed in the Zakera Ward of the Citadel in Mass Effect 2. In Mass Effect 3, he is promoted to C-Sec Commander in-charge of C-Sec operations of the Citadel Embassies quarters. He is a mostly upstanding officer, but is pragmatic enough to bend the rules if it is more convenient or rewarding for him.  Bailey is voiced by Michael Hogan.  Kal'Reegar Kal'Reegar is a marine of the quarian Migrant Fleet who is assigned to protect Tali'Zorah, who is on a mission to perform research work on the planet Haestrom in Mass Effect 2. If he survives the mission, he will participate as a witness in Tali'Zorahs trial before the quarian Admiralty Board where she is accused of treason.  Kal'Reegar is voiced by Adam Baldwin.  Shala'Raan vas Tonbay Admiral Shala'Raan vas Tonbay is a member of the quarian Admiralty Board, an administrative council of admirals which oversees the quarian civilian government. Along with other members of the Board, she plays a pivotal role in Tali'Zorah's's loyalty mission in Mass Effect 2, and leads the quarian Migrant Fleet to retake their homeworld Rannoch from the geth in Mass Effect 3. A family friend of Tali'Zorah, Shala'Raan fulfills a portion of the character's role within the narrative of Mass Effect 3 in imported saved games where she is deceased and cannot appear in-game.  Shala'Raan is voiced by Shohreh Aghdashloo.  Daro'Xen vas Moreh Admiral Daro'Xen vas Moreh is a member of the quarian Admiralty Board, an administrative council of admirals which oversees the quarian civilian government. Along with other members of the Board, she plays a pivotal role in Tali'Zorah's's loyalty mission in Mass Effect 2, and leads the quarian Migrant Fleet to retake their homeworld Rannoch from the geth in Mass Effect 3. Known for her keen scientific intellect, she fulfills a portion of Tali'Zorah's role within the narrative of Mass Effect 3 in imported saved games where she is deceased and cannot appear in-game.  Daro'Xen is voiced by Claudia Black, who also voices Matriarch Aethyta, the former partner of Matriarch Benezia and Liara T'Soni's other parent.  Gatatog Uvenk Gatatog Uvenk is a Krogan Battle Master who appears as a minor antagonist in Grunt's loyalty mission on Tuchanka. He is voiced by Michael Dorn.  Niftu Cal Niftu Cal is a self-styled ""biotic god"" and a member of the volus merchant Pitne Four's trade delegation in Mass Effect 2. He has chemically induced delusions of grandeur after being administered with biotic-enhancing drugs, manifesting minor biotic talents as a result. Game writer Brian Kindregan created Niftu Cal and added him into Mass Effect 2 as a joke character, where he became popular with fans as an internet meme.  Niftu Cal is voiced by Mark Meer.  Fenlon from PC Gamer called Niftu Cal the ""funniest throwaway character BioWare ever created."" A similar character archetype, a volus adept, was later added into Mass Effect 3's multiplayer mode as a result of the character's popularity.  Samantha Traynor Communications Specialist Samantha Traynor appears in Mass Effect 3, serving in a similar role to that of her predecessor, Yeoman Kelly Chambers as Commander Shepard's personal assistant. She also serves as an information manager as well as a telecommunications expert on the SSV Normandy SR-2. Traynor is a lesbian and as such is available romantically for a female Shepard only.  Traynor is voiced by Alix Wilton Regan.  Steve Cortez Lieutenant Steve Cortez is a Systems Alliance supply procurement specialist aboard the SSV Normandy SR-2 in Mass Effect 3, and also serves as the Normandy's UT-47A Kodiak shuttle pilot that transports Commander Shepard and the squad to various mission locations. Recently widowed after the death of his husband, Cortez may be helped through his grief by Shepard, and eventually may become an optional romance for a male Shepard.  Cortez is voiced by Matthew Del Negro.  Diana Allers Diana Allers is a human Alliance News Network war correspondent and regular on the Alliance News Network's ""Battlespace"" in Mass Effect 3. She is a romance option for a male or female Shepard, but does not grant the ""Paramour"" achievement.  Allers is voiced by Jessica Chobot; the character is modelled in her likeness, which has attracted criticism from gaming journalists.  Eve Urdnot Bakara, nicknamed Eve by her supervising salarian scientists, is a fertile female krogan who plays a pivotal role in the conclusion of the Krogan Genophage storyline in Mass Effect 3. Eve is a moderate figurehead among the krogan leadership who is eager to secure a cure for the genophage and bring about a new start for her people.  Jondum Bau Jondum Bau is a salarian Spectre and colleague of Commander Shepard.  András Neltz from Kotaku considers the brief interaction with the character in Mass Effect 3 to expose a traitor as unique, as the player gets to experience the Spectres as independent agents who sometimes meet up to assist each other, noting that previous Spectre characters either end up dying or were antagonists to the player character. The character is named after BioWare writer John Dombrow.  Nyreen Kandros Nyreen Kandros is the turian leader of the Talons mercenary organization on Omega, who joins Shepard as a temporary squad mate in the Mass Effect 3 DLC Omega. She utilizes a mixture of biotic and tech powers, and has a complicated history with Aria T'Loak. Nyreen fights to free the people of Omega station who have been enslaved by the human supremacist group Cerberus. She also appears as a supporting character in the prequel tie-in comic to Andromeda, Mass Effect: Deception.  Kandros is voiced by Sumalee Montano.  The Stargazer The Stargazer is a humanoid entity of indeterminate race and background from the far future who narrates Commander Shepard's deeds, a legendary figure in their timeline, to a child companion in the ending of Mass Effect 3. Depending on the player's choices in the final battle for Earth, one of the Stargazer's iterations may be voiced by Buzz Aldrin.  Mass Effect: Andromeda  Alec Ryder Alec Ryder is a character in Mass Effect: Andromeda and the father of Scott and Sara Ryder. A veteran of galactic exploration, Ryder was a member of the original team that travelled through the Charon mass relay which marked the first step of Humanity's expansion into the galactic community. He is later accepted for Interplanetary Combatives Training which he completes and is subsequently awarded his N7 designation. A veteran of the First Contact War, Ryder became interested in the use of Artificial Intelligence as a method to help human advancement, however such research and experimentation is illegal under Citadel law. Once his work is discovered, he is dishonourably discharged from the Systems Alliance military. Alec Ryder later joins the Andromeda Initiative as a Pathfinder, the title for leader of each of the Initiative's arkships, and is responsible for the human-majority population aboard his ship Hyperion.  Alec is voiced by Clancy Brown.  SAM SAM, which stands for Simulated Adaptive Matrix, is an AI designed by Alec Ryder and was connected to him; he later passes on the connection to his child who succeeds him as the human Pathfinder. SAM is permanently connected to the Pathfinder, and sees and feels as they do via a neural link, which was originally created by Alec's wife Dr. Elen Ryder. SAM handles a number of tasks as well as assists the Tempest's crew from its node in the Hyperion ark. Through the neural link and a quantum entanglement communication system, SAM can provide the Pathfinder with support in the form of “situational awareness, problem solving and even tactical enhancements”. SAM's computing power also enhances the Pathfinder's combat abilities in the form of six ""profiles"", which in gameplay terms is analogous to the class system from the original trilogy.  SAM is voiced by Alexia Traverse-Healy.  Lexi T'Perro Dr. Lexi T'Perro is the asari doctor on the human ark ship Hyperion, who is later transferred to the Tempest as the resident doctor. She  checks on one of the Ryder siblings, who would go on to become the next human Pathfinder, after they are thawed out of cryosleep. Lexi monitors the Pathfinder team's physical and mental wellbeing, and provides general advice to the Pathfinder.  Lexi is voiced by Natalie Dormer.  Kallo Jath Kallo Jath is the salarian pilot of the Tempest and one of its co-designers. He narrates the Andromeda Initiative's introductory briefing to the ND1 Nomad and Tempest vehicles.  Kallo is voiced by Garett Ross.  Suvi Anwar Suvi Anwar is a Scot who is the Tempest's science officer. She sees science and religion as complementary, with the former as a means of understanding “the divine intelligence behind all of creation"", and speaks openly about her faith. She is a potential romance option for a female Pathfinder.  Suvi is voiced by Katy Townsend.  Gil Brodie Gil Brodie is the Tempest's engineer, and is described as having a ""pretty colourful personality with a bizarre sense of humour"". He is a potential romance option for a male Pathfinder.  Gil is voiced by Gethin Anthony.  Jarun Tann Jarun Tann is a salarian politician, who plays a prominent role in the Andromeda Initiative's efforts to establish a government in the new galaxy, though his actual competence as an administrator may be called into question. He is described as meaning well, ""but also likes power, and plays up his own effectiveness and importance"". The Pathfinder may find themselves navigating the moral shades of grey the Mass Effect series is known for in their dealings with Jarun. He also appears in the tie-in novel to Andromeda, Mass Effect Andromeda: Nexus Uprising, where he is portrayed as the central character of the uprising led by former security chief Sloane Kelly at the Nexus. Ben Gilbert from Business Insider mentioned Tann as an example of the best aspects of the Mass Effect series: characters ""who respond in realistic ways, who are just as likely to be honest as they are to be manipulative"".  Tann is voiced by Kumail Nanjiani.  Tiran Kandros Tiran Kandros is the turian leader of the de facto volunteer militia for the Andromeda Initiative based in the Nexus, known as APEX, and the cousin of Nyreen Kandros. He also appears in the tie-in novel to Andromeda, Mass Effect Andromeda: Nexus Uprising, and is the central character of the prequel comic Mass Effect: Deception, which follows his attempt to infiltrate the Andromeda Initiative.  Kandros is voiced by Steve Pirot.  Foster Addison Foster Addison is the Director of Colonial Affairs for the Andromeda Initiative based in the Nexus. The character gained notoriety as a meme after numerous screenshots and videos of her poorly animated facial animations circulated various internet sites as an example of Andromeda's technical issues.  Foster is voiced by Zoe Telford.  Nakmor Kesh Nakmor Kesh is the granddaughter of Nakmor Drack, who serves as the superintendent of the Nexus space station, the administrative hub for the Andromeda Initiative. Ben Gilbert from Business Insider mentioned Kesh as an example of the best aspects of the Mass Effect series: characters ""who respond in realistic ways, who are just as likely to be honest as they are to be manipulative"".  Kesh is voiced by Allegra Clark.  Hainly Abrams Hainly Abrams is a researcher assigned to Prodromos on the planet Eos. During an introductory conversation with the Pathfinder shortly after they met, Abrams reveals that she was known as Stephan prior to her gender transitioning, which motivated her to join the Andromeda Initiative and depart from the Milky Way galaxy to start a new life. The presentation of the character and her gender identity was met with criticism shortly after the launch of Andromeda, prompting BioWare to issue an apology as well as a pledge to adjust the character's dialogue.

Packet switching,"In telecommunications, packet switching is a method of grouping data  into packets that are transmitted over a digital network. Packets are made of a header and a payload. Data in the header is used by networking hardware to direct the packet to its destination, where the payload is extracted and used by an operating system, application software, or higher layer protocols. Packet switching is the primary basis for data communications in computer networks worldwide.  In the early 1960s, American computer scientist Paul Baran developed the concept Distributed Adaptive Message Block Switching, with the goal of providing a fault-tolerant, efficient routing method for telecommunication messages as part of a research program at the RAND Corporation, funded by the US Department of Defense. This concept contradicted then-established principles of pre-allocation of network bandwidth, exemplified by the development of telecommunications in the Bell System. The new concept found little resonance among network implementers until the independent work of British computer scientist Donald Davies at the National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom) in 1965. Davies is credited with coining the modern term packet switching and inspiring numerous packet switching networks in the decade following, including the incorporation of the concept into the design of the ARPANET in the United States.  Concept  A simple definition of packet switching is:  Packet switching allows delivery of variable bit rate data streams, realized as sequences of packets, over a computer network which allocates transmission resources as needed using statistical multiplexing or dynamic bandwidth allocation techniques. As they traverse networking hardware, such as switches and routers, packets are received, buffered, queued, and retransmitted (stored and forwarded), resulting in variable latency and throughput depending on the link capacity and the traffic load on the network. Packets are normally forwarded by intermediate network nodes asynchronously using first-in, first-out buffering, but may be forwarded according to some scheduling discipline for fair queuing, traffic shaping, or for differentiated or guaranteed quality of service, such as weighted fair queuing or leaky bucket. Packet-based communication may be implemented with or without intermediate forwarding nodes (switches and routers). In case of a shared physical medium (such as radio or 10BASE5), the packets may be delivered according to a multiple access scheme.  Packet switching contrasts with another principal networking paradigm, circuit switching, a method which pre-allocates dedicated network bandwidth specifically for each communication session, each having a constant bit rate and latency between nodes. In cases of billable services, such as cellular communication services, circuit switching is characterized by a fee per unit of connection time, even when no data is transferred, while packet switching may be characterized by a fee per unit of information transmitted, such as characters, packets, or messages.  A packet switch has four components: input ports, output ports, routing processor, and switching fabric.  History  The concept of switching small blocks of data was first explored independently by Paul Baran at the RAND Corporation in the early 1960s in the US and Donald Davies at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in the UK in 1965.  In the late 1950s, the US Air Force established a wide area network for the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) radar defense system. Recognizing vulnerabilities in this network, the Air Force sought a system that might survive a nuclear attack to enable a response, thus diminishing the attractiveness of the first strike advantage by enemies (see Mutual assured destruction). Baran developed the concept of distributed adaptive message block switching in support of the Air Force initiative. The concept was first presented to the Air Force in the summer of 1961 as briefing B-265, later published as RAND report P-2626 in 1962, and finally in report RM 3420 in 1964. Report P-2626 described a general architecture for a large-scale, distributed, survivable communications network. The work focuses on three key ideas: use of a decentralized network with multiple paths between any two points, dividing user messages into message blocks, and delivery of these messages by store and forward switching.  Davies independently developed a similar message routing concept in 1965. He coined the term packet switching, and proposed building a commercial nationwide data network in the UK. He gave a talk on the proposal in 1966, after which a person from the Ministry of Defence (MoD) told him about Baran's work. Roger Scantlebury, a member of Davies' team met Lawrence Roberts at the 1967 Symposium on Operating Systems Principles and suggested it for use in the ARPANET. Davies had chosen some of the same parameters for his original network design as did Baran, such as a packet size of 1024 bits. In 1966, Davies proposed that a network should be built at the laboratory to serve the needs of NPL and prove the feasibility of packet switching. To deal with packet permutations (due to dynamically updated route preferences) and to datagram losses (unavoidable when fast sources send to a slow destinations), he assumed that ""all users of the network will provide themselves with some kind of error control"", thus inventing what came to be known the end-to-end principle. After a pilot experiment in 1969, the NPL Data Communications Network entered service in 1970.  Leonard Kleinrock conducted research into queueing theory for his doctoral dissertation at MIT in 1961-2 and published it as a book in 1964 in the field of message switching. In 1968, Lawrence Roberts contracted with Kleinrock to carry out theoretical work at UCLA to model the performance of the ARPANET, which underpinned the development of the network in the early 1970s. The NPL team also carried out simulation work on packet networks, including datagram networks.  The French CYCLADES network, designed by Louis Pouzin in the early 1970s, was the first to implement the end-to-end principle of Davies, and make the hosts responsible for the reliable delivery of data on a packet-switched network, rather than this being a service of the network itself. His team was thus first to tackle the highly complex problem of providing user applications with a reliable virtual circuit service while using a best effort network service, an early contribution to what will be Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).  In May 1974, Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn described the Transmission Control Program, an internetworking protocol for sharing resources using packet-switching among the nodes. The specifications of the TCP were then published in  (Specification of Internet Transmission Control Program), written by Vint Cerf, Yogen Dalal and Carl Sunshine in December 1974. This monolithic protocol was later layered as the Transmission Control Protocol, TCP, atop the Internet Protocol, IP.  Complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) VLSI (very-large-scale integration) technology led to the development of high-speed broadband packet switching during the 1980s1990s.  Beginning in the mid-1990s, Leonard Kleinrock sought to be recognized as the ""father of modern data networking"". However, Kleinrock's claims that his work in the early 1960s originated the concept of packet switching and that this work was the source of the packet switching concepts used in the ARPANET are disputed, including by Robert Taylor, Paul Baran, and Donald Davies. Baran and Davies are recognized by historians and the U.S. National Inventors Hall of Fame for independently inventing the concept of digital packet switching used in modern computer networking including the Internet.  Connectionless and connection-oriented modes Packet switching may be classified into connectionless packet switching, also known as datagram switching, and connection-oriented packet switching, also known as virtual circuit switching. Examples of connectionless systems are Ethernet, Internet Protocol (IP), and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). Connection-oriented systems include X.25, Frame Relay, Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), and the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).  In connectionless mode each packet is labeled with a destination address, source address, and port numbers. It may also be labeled with the sequence number of the packet. This information eliminates the need for a pre-established path to help the packet find its way to its destination, but means that more information is needed in the packet header, which is therefore larger. The packets are routed individually, sometimes taking different paths resulting in out-of-order delivery. At the destination, the original message may be reassembled in the correct order, based on the packet sequence numbers. Thus a virtual circuit carrying a byte stream is provided to the application by a transport layer protocol, although the network only provides a connectionless network layer service.  Connection-oriented transmission requires a setup phase to establish the parameters of communication before any packet is transferred. The signaling protocols used for setup allow the application to specify its requirements and discover link parameters. Acceptable values for service parameters may be negotiated. The packets transferred may include a connection identifier rather than address information and the packet header can be smaller, as it only needs to contain this code and any information, such as length, timestamp, or sequence number, which is different for different packets. In this case, address information is only transferred to each node during the connection setup phase, when the route to the destination is discovered and an entry is added to the switching table in each network node through which the connection passes. When a connection identifier is used, routing a packet requires the node to look up the connection identifier in a table.  Connection-oriented transport layer protocols such as TCP provide a connection-oriented service by using an underlying connectionless network. In this case, the end-to-end principle dictates that the end nodes, not the network itself, are responsible for the connection-oriented behavior.  Packet switching in networks Packet switching is used to optimize the use of the channel capacity available in digital telecommunication networks, such as computer networks, and minimize the transmission latency (the time it takes for data to pass across the network), and to increase robustness of communication.  Packet switching is used in the Internet and most local area networks. The Internet is implemented by the Internet Protocol Suite using a variety of link layer technologies. For example, Ethernet and Frame Relay are common. Newer mobile phone technologies (e.g., GSM, LTE) also use packet switching. Packet switching is associated with connectionless networking because, in these systems, no connection agreement needs to be established between communicating parties prior to exchanging data.  X.25 is a notable use of packet switching in that, despite being based on packet switching methods, it provides virtual circuits to the user. These virtual circuits carry variable-length packets. In 1978, X.25 provided the first international and commercial packet switching network, the International Packet Switched Service (IPSS). Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) also is a virtual circuit technology, which uses fixed-length cell relay connection oriented packet switching.  Technologies such as Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) create virtual circuits on top of datagram networks. MPLS and its predecessors, as well as ATM, have been called ""fast packet"" technologies. MPLS, indeed, has been called ""ATM without cells"". Virtual circuits are especially useful in building robust failover mechanisms and allocating bandwidth for delay-sensitive applications.  Packet-switched networks  The history of packet-switched networks can be divided into three overlapping eras: early networks before the introduction of X.25 and the OSI model; the X.25 era when many postal, telephone, and telegraph (PTT) companies provided public data networks with X.25 interfaces; and the Internet era.  Early networks Research into packet switching at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) began with a proposal for a wide-area network in 1965, and a local-area network in 1966. ARPANET funding was secured in 1966 by Bob Taylor, and planning began in 1967 when he hired Larry Roberts. The NPL network, ARPANET, and SITA HLN became operational in 1969. Before the introduction of X.25 in 1973, about twenty different network technologies had been developed. Two fundamental differences involved the division of functions and tasks between the hosts at the edge of the network and the network core. In the datagram system, operating according to the end-to-end principle, the hosts have the responsibility to ensure orderly delivery of packets. In the virtual call system, the network guarantees sequenced delivery of data to the host. This results in a simpler host interface but complicates the network. The X.25 protocol suite uses this network type.  AppleTalk AppleTalk is a proprietary suite of networking protocols developed by Apple in 1985 for Apple Macintosh computers. It was the primary protocol used by Apple devices through the 1980s and 1990s. AppleTalk included features that allowed local area networks to be established ad hoc without the requirement for a centralized router or server. The AppleTalk system automatically assigned addresses, updated the distributed namespace, and configured any required inter-network routing. It was a plug-n-play system.  AppleTalk implementations were also released for the IBM PC and compatibles, and the Apple IIGS. AppleTalk support was available in most networked printers, especially laser printers, some file servers and routers. AppleTalk support was terminated in 2009, replaced by TCP/IP protocols.  ARPANET The ARPANET was a progenitor network of the Internet and one of the first networks, along with ARPA's SATNET, to run the TCP/IP suite using packet switching technologies.  BNRNET BNRNET was a network which Bell-Northern Research developed for internal use. It initially had only one host but was designed to support many hosts. BNR later made major contributions to the CCITT X.25 project.  CYCLADES The CYCLADES packet switching network was a French research network designed and directed by Louis Pouzin. First demonstrated in 1973, it was developed to explore alternatives to the early ARPANET design and to support network research generally. It was the first network to use the end-to-end principle and make the hosts responsible for reliable delivery of data, rather than the network itself. Concepts of this network influenced later ARPANET architecture.  DECnet DECnet is a suite of network protocols created by Digital Equipment Corporation, originally released in 1975 in order to connect two PDP-11 minicomputers. It evolved into one of the first peer-to-peer network architectures, thus transforming DEC into a networking powerhouse in the 1980s. Initially built with three layers, it later (1982) evolved into a seven-layer OSI-compliant networking protocol. The DECnet protocols were designed entirely by Digital Equipment Corporation. However, DECnet Phase II (and later) were open standards with published specifications, and several implementations were developed outside DEC, including one for Linux.  DDX-1 DDX-1 was an experimental network from Nippon PTT. It mixed circuit switching and packet switching. It was succeeded by DDX-2.  EIN The European Informatics Network (EIN), originally called COST 11, was a project beginning in 1971 to link networks in Britain, France, Italy, Switzerland and Euratom. Six other European countries also participated in the research on network protocols. Derek Barber directed the project and Roger Scantlebury led the UK technical contribution; both were from NPL. Work began in 1973 and it became operational in 1976 including nodes linking the NPL network and CYCLADES. The transport protocol of the EIN was the basis of the one adopted by the International Networking Working Group. EIN was replaced by Euronet in 1979.  EPSS The Experimental Packet Switched Service (EPSS) was an experiment of the UK Post Office Telecommunications, based on the Coloured Book protocols defined by the UK academic community in 1975. It was the first public data network in the UK when it began operating in 1977. Ferranti supplied the hardware and software. The handling of link control messages (acknowledgements and flow control) was different from that of most other networks.  GEIS As General Electric Information Services (GEIS), General Electric was a major international provider of information services. The company originally designed a telephone network to serve as its internal (albeit continent-wide) voice telephone network.  In 1965, at the instigation of Warner Sinback, a data network based on this voice-phone network was designed to connect GE's four computer sales and service centers (Schenectady, New York, Chicago, and Phoenix) to facilitate a computer time-sharing service.  After going international some years later, GEIS created a network data center near Cleveland, Ohio. Very little has been published about the internal details of their network. The design was hierarchical with redundant communication links.  IPSANET IPSANET was a semi-private network constructed by I. P. Sharp Associates to serve their time-sharing customers. It became operational in May 1976.  IPX/SPX The Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX) and Sequenced Packet Exchange (SPX) are Novell networking protocols from the 1980s derived from Xerox Network Systems' IDP and SPP protocols, respectively which date back to the 1970s. IPX/SPX was used primarily on networks using the Novell NetWare operating systems.  Merit Network Merit Network, an independent nonprofit organization governed by Michigan's public universities, was formed in 1966 as the Michigan Educational Research Information Triad to explore computer networking between three of Michigan's public universities as a means to help the state's educational and economic development. With initial support from the State of Michigan and the National Science Foundation (NSF), the packet-switched network was first demonstrated in December 1971 when an interactive host-to-host connection was made between the IBM mainframe systems at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and Wayne State University in Detroit. In October 1972, connections to the CDC mainframe at Michigan State University in East Lansing completed the triad. Over the next several years, in addition to host-to-host interactive connections, the network was enhanced to support terminal-to-host connections, host-to-host batch connections (remote job submission, remote printing, batch file transfer), interactive file transfer, gateways to the Tymnet and Telenet public data networks, X.25 host attachments, gateways to X.25 data networks, Ethernet attached hosts, and eventually TCP/IP; additionally, public universities in Michigan joined the network. All of this set the stage for Merit's role in the NSFNET project starting in the mid-1980s.  NPL In 1965, Donald Davies of the National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom) designed and proposed a national commercial data network based on packet switching. The proposal was not taken up nationally but, in 1966, he designed a local network using  ""interface computers"", today known as routers, to serve the needs of NPL and prove the feasibility of packet switching.  By 1968 Davies had begun building the NPL network to meet the needs of the multidisciplinary laboratory and prove the technology under operational conditions. In 1976, 12 computers and 75 terminal devices were attached, and more were added until the network was replaced in 1986. NPL, followed by ARPANET, were the first two networks to use packet switching, and were interconnected in the early 1970s.  Octopus Octopus was a local network at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. It connected sundry hosts at the lab to interactive terminals and various computer peripherals including a bulk storage system.  Philips Research Philips Research Laboratories in Redhill, Surrey developed a packet switching network for internal use. It was a datagram network with a single switching node.  PUP PARC Universal Packet (PUP or Pup) was one of the two earliest internetworking protocol suites; it was created by researchers at Xerox PARC in the mid-1970s. The entire suite provided routing and packet delivery, as well as higher level functions such as a reliable byte stream, along with numerous applications. Further developments led to Xerox Network Systems (XNS).  RCP RCP was an experimental network created by the French PTT. It was used to gain experience with packet switching technology before the specification of TRANSPAC was frozen. RCP was a virtual-circuit network in contrast to CYCLADES which was based on datagrams. RCP emphasised terminal-to-host and terminal-to-terminal connection; CYCLADES was concerned with host-to-host communication. TRANSPAC was introduced as an X.25 network. RCP influenced the X.25 specification.  RETD Red Especial de Transmisión de Datos (RETD) was a network developed by Compañía Telefónica Nacional de España. It became operational in 1972 and thus was the first public network.  SCANNET ""The experimental packet-switched Nordic telecommunication network SCANNET was implemented in Nordic technical libraries in the 1970s, and it included first Nordic electronic journal Extemplo. Libraries were also among first ones in universities to accommodate microcomputers for public use in the early 1980s.""  SITA HLN SITA is a consortium of airlines. Its High Level Network (HLN) became operational in 1969 at about the same time as ARPANET. It carried interactive traffic and message-switching traffic. As with many non-academic networks, very little has been published about it.  Systems Network Architecture Systems Network Architecture (SNA) is IBM's proprietary networking architecture created in 1974. An IBM customer could acquire hardware and software from IBM and lease private lines from a common carrier to construct a private network.  Telenet Telenet was the first FCC-licensed public data network in the United States. Telenet was incorporated in 1973 and started operations in 1975. It was founded by Bolt Beranek & Newman with Larry Roberts as CEO as a means of making packet switching technology public. Telenet initially used a proprietary virtual connection host interface, but changed the host interface to X.25 and the terminal interface to X.29. It went public in 1979 and was then sold to GTE.  Tymnet Tymnet was an international data communications network headquartered in San Jose, CA that utilized virtual call packet switched technology and used X.25, SNA/SDLC, BSC and ASCII interfaces to connect host computers (servers) at thousands of large companies, educational institutions, and government agencies. Users typically connected via dial-up connections or dedicated asynchronous serial connections. The business consisted of a large public network that supported dial-up users and a private network business that allowed government agencies and large companies (mostly banks and airlines) to build their own dedicated networks. The private networks were often connected via gateways to the public network to reach locations not on the private network. Tymnet was also connected to dozens of other public networks in the U.S. and internationally via X.25/X.75 gateways.  XNS Xerox Network Systems (XNS) was a protocol suite promulgated by Xerox, which provided routing and packet delivery, as well as higher level functions such as a reliable stream, and remote procedure calls. It was developed from PARC Universal Packet (PUP).  X.25 era  There were two kinds of X.25 networks. Some such as DATAPAC and TRANSPAC were initially implemented with an X.25 external interface. Some older networks such as TELENET and TYMNET were modified to provide a X.25 host interface in addition to older host connection schemes. DATAPAC was developed by Bell-Northern Research which was a joint venture of Bell Canada (a common carrier) and Northern Telecom (a telecommunications equipment supplier). Northern Telecom sold several DATAPAC clones to foreign PTTs including the Deutsche Bundespost. X.75 and X.121 allowed the interconnection of national X.25 networks. A user or host could call a host on a foreign network by including the DNIC of the remote network as part of the destination address.  AUSTPAC AUSTPAC was an Australian public X.25 network operated by Telstra. Started by Telecom Australia in the early 1980s, AUSTPAC was Australia's first public packet-switched data network and supported applications such as on-line betting, financial applications—the Australian Tax Office made use of AUSTPAC—and remote terminal access to academic institutions, who maintained their connections to AUSTPAC up until the mid-late 1990s in some cases. Access was via a dial-up terminal to a PAD, or, by linking a permanent X.25 node to the network.  ConnNet ConnNet was a packet-switched data network operated by the Southern New England Telephone Company serving the state of Connecticut.  Datanet 1 Datanet 1 was the public switched data network operated by the Dutch PTT Telecom (now known as KPN). Strictly speaking Datanet 1 only referred to the network and the connected users via leased lines (using the X.121 DNIC 2041), the name also referred to the public PAD service Telepad (using the DNIC 2049). And because the main Videotex service used the network and modified PAD devices as infrastructure the name Datanet 1 was used for these services as well. Although this use of the name was incorrect all these services were managed by the same people within one department of KPN contributed to the confusion.  Datapac DATAPAC was the first operational X.25 network (1976). It covered major Canadian cities and was eventually extended to smaller centres.  Datex-P Deutsche Bundespost operated this national network in Germany. The technology was acquired from Northern Telecom.  Eirpac Eirpac is the Irish public switched data network supporting X.25 and X.28. It was launched in 1984, replacing Euronet. Eirpac is run by Eircom.  Euronet Nine member states of the European Economic Community contracted with Logica and the French company SESA to set up a joint venture in 1975 to undertake the Euronet development, using X.25 protocols to form virtual circuits. It was to replace EIN and established a network in 1979 linking a number of European countries until 1984 when the network was handed over to national PTTs.  HIPA-NET Hitachi designed a private network system for sale as a turnkey package to multi-national organizations. In addition to providing X.25 packet switching, message switching software was also included. Messages were buffered at the nodes adjacent to the sending and receiving terminals. Switched virtual calls were not supported, but through the use of ""logical ports"" an originating terminal could have a menu of pre-defined destination terminals.  Iberpac Iberpac is the Spanish public packet-switched network, providing X.25 services. Iberpac is run by Telefonica.  IPSS In 1978, X.25 provided the first international and commercial packet switching network, the International Packet Switched Service (IPSS).  JANET JANET was the UK academic and research network, linking all universities, higher education establishments, publicly funded research laboratories. The X.25 network, which used the Coloured Book protocols, was based mainly on GEC 4000 series switches, and run X.25 links at up to 8 Mbit/s in its final phase before being converted to an IP based network. The JANET network grew out of the 1970s SRCnet, later called SERCnet.  PSS Packet Switch Stream (PSS) was the UK Post Office (later to become British Telecom) national X.25 network with a DNIC of 2342. British Telecom renamed PSS under its GNS (Global Network Service) name, but the PSS name has remained better known. PSS also included public dial-up PAD access, and various InterStream gateways to other services such as Telex.  TRANSPAC TRANSPAC was the national X.25 network in France. It was developed locally at about the same time as DATAPAC in Canada. The development was done by the French PTT and influenced by the experimental RCP network. It began operation in 1978, and served both commercial users and, after Minitel began, consumers.  VENUS-P VENUS-P was an international X.25 network that operated from April 1982 through March 2006. At its subscription peak in 1999, VENUS-P connected 207 networks in 87 countries.  Venepaq Venepaq is the national X.25 public network in Venezuela. It is run by Cantv and allow direct connection and dial up connections. Provides nationalwide access at very low cost. It provides national and international access. Venepaq allow connection from 19.2 kbit/s to 64 kbit/s in direct connections, and 1200, 2400 and 9600 bit/s in dial up connections.  Internet era  When Internet connectivity was made available to anyone who could pay for an ISP subscription, the distinctions between national networks blurred. The user no longer saw network identifiers such as the DNIC. Some older technologies such as circuit switching have resurfaced with new names such as fast packet switching. Researchers have created some experimental networks to complement the existing Internet.  CSNET The Computer Science Network (CSNET) was a computer network funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) that began operation in 1981. Its purpose was to extend networking benefits, for computer science departments at academic and research institutions that could not be directly connected to ARPANET, due to funding or authorization limitations. It played a significant role in spreading awareness of, and access to, national networking and was a major milestone on the path to development of the global Internet.  Internet2 Internet2 is a not-for-profit United States computer networking consortium led by members from the research and education communities, industry, and government. The Internet2 community, in partnership with Qwest, built the first Internet2 Network, called Abilene, in 1998 and was a prime investor in the National LambdaRail (NLR) project. In 2006, Internet2 announced a partnership with Level 3 Communications to launch a brand new nationwide network, boosting its capacity from 10 Gbit/s to 100 Gbit/s. In October, 2007, Internet2 officially retired Abilene and now refers to its new, higher capacity network as the Internet2 Network.  NSFNET  The National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET) was a program of coordinated, evolving projects sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF) beginning in 1985 to promote advanced research and education networking in the United States. NSFNET was also the name given to several nationwide backbone networks operating at speeds of 56 kbit/s, 1.5 Mbit/s (T1), and 45 Mbit/s (T3) that were constructed to support NSF's networking initiatives from 1985-1995. Initially created to link researchers to the nation's NSF-funded supercomputing centers, through further public funding and private industry partnerships it developed into a major part of the Internet backbone.  NSFNET regional networks In addition to the five NSF supercomputer centers, NSFNET provided connectivity to eleven regional networks and through these networks to many smaller regional and campus networks in the United States. The NSFNET regional networks were: BARRNet, the Bay Area Regional Research Network in Palo Alto, California; CERFNET, California Education and Research Federation Network in San Diego, California, serving California and Nevada; CICNet, the Committee on Institutional Cooperation Network via the Merit Network in Ann Arbor, Michigan and later as part of the T3 upgrade via Argonne National Laboratory outside of Chicago, serving the Big Ten Universities and the University of Chicago in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin; Merit/MichNet in Ann Arbor, Michigan serving Michigan, formed in 1966, still in operation as of 2016; MIDnet in Lincoln, Nebraska serving Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and South Dakota; NEARNET, the New England Academic and Research Network in Cambridge, Massachusetts, added as part of the upgrade to T3, serving Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont, established in late 1988, operated by BBN under contract to MIT, BBN assumed responsibility for NEARNET on 1 July 1993; NorthWestNet in Seattle, Washington, serving Alaska, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, Oregon, and Washington, founded in 1987; NYSERNet, New York State Education and Research Network in Ithaca, New York; JVNCNet, the John von Neumann National Supercomputer Center Network in Princeton, New Jersey, serving Delaware and New Jersey; SESQUINET, the Sesquicentennial Network in Houston, Texas, founded during the 150th anniversary of the State of Texas; SURAnet, the Southeastern Universities Research Association network in College Park, Maryland and later as part of the T3 upgrade in Atlanta, Georgia serving Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia, sold to BBN in 1994; and Westnet in Salt Lake City, Utah and Boulder, Colorado, serving Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming.  National LambdaRail The National LambdaRail was launched in September 2003. It is a 12,000-mile high-speed national computer network owned and operated by the U.S. research and education community that runs over fiber-optic lines. It was the first transcontinental 10 Gigabit Ethernet network. It operates with high aggregate capacity of up to 1.6 Tbit/s and a high 40 Gbit/s bitrate, with plans for 100 Gbit/s. The upgrade never took place and NLR ceased operations in March 2014.  TransPAC, TransPAC2, and TransPAC3 TransPAC2 and TransPAC3, continuations of the TransPAC project, a high-speed international Internet service connecting research and education networks in the Asia-Pacific region to those in the US. TransPAC is part of the NSF's International Research Network Connections (IRNC) program.  Very high-speed Backbone Network Service (vBNS) The Very high-speed Backbone Network Service (vBNS) came on line in April 1995 as part of a National Science Foundation (NSF) sponsored project to provide high-speed interconnection between NSF-sponsored supercomputing centers and select access points in the United States. The network was engineered and operated by MCI Telecommunications under a cooperative agreement with the NSF. By 1998, the vBNS had grown to connect more than 100 universities and research and engineering institutions via 12 national points of presence with DS-3 (45 Mbit/s), OC-3c (155 Mbit/s), and OC-12c (622 Mbit/s) links on an all OC-12c backbone, a substantial engineering feat for that time. The vBNS installed one of the first ever production OC-48c (2.5 Gbit/s) IP links in February 1999 and went on to upgrade the entire backbone to OC-48c.  In June 1999 MCI WorldCom introduced vBNS+ which allowed attachments to the vBNS network by organizations that were not approved by or receiving support from NSF. After the expiration of the NSF agreement, the vBNS largely transitioned to providing service to the government. Most universities and research centers migrated to the Internet2 educational backbone. In January 2006, when MCI and Verizon merged, vBNS+ became a service of Verizon Business.

Warsaw Theatre Directorate,"The Warsaw Theatre Directorate (Warszawskie Teatry Rządowe) was the chief authority for theatres in the Duchy of Warsaw in Warsaw during the 19th and early 20th centuries. It was set up by decree of Frederick Augustus I of Saxony on 14 April 1810 as the Rządowa Dyrekcja Teatru (Government Directorate for Theatre), its draft statute having been developed by Wojciecha Bogusławskiego. In 1822 it changed its name to Dyrekcja Teatrów i Wszelkich Widowisk Dramatycznych i Muzycznych w Królestwie (Directorate of all theatres and dramatic and musical performance in the Kingdom), then in 1833 to the Warsaw Theatre Directorate. It ceased to exist in July 1915.  It guided theatrical output and provided theatres with financial stability, enabling shows in Polish to be put on and new theatre buildings to be constructed. Its companies included ones for operettas, ballets, dramas, comedies, the National Theatre and later opera and farce.  It had 5 buildings:  from 1833 - Teatr Wielki and the Teatr Rozmaitości  from 1870 - Teatr Letni  from 1880 - Teatr Mały  from 1881 - Teatr Nowy  from 1901 - Teatr Nowości  Presidents  The body's president was supported by a board of governors and by directors, and from 1907 by literary managers.

"The Wheatsheaf, Fitzrovia","The Wheatsheaf is a pub in Rathbone Place, Fitzrovia, London, that was popular with London's bohemian set in the 1930s. Its customers included George Orwell, Dylan Thomas, Edwin Muir and Humphrey Jennings, who were known for a while as the Wheatsheaf writers  Other habitués included the singer and dancer Betty May, and the writer and surrealist poet Philip O'Connor, Nina Hamnett, Julian Maclaren-Ross, Anthony Carson and Quentin Crisp.  Dylan Thomas In spring 1936, the poet Dylan Thomas met Caitlin Macnamara (1913–1994), a 22-year-old blonde-haired, blue-eyed dancer of Irish descent. She had run away from home, intent on making a career in dance, and aged 18 joined the chorus line at the London Palladium. Introduced by the artist Augustus John, Caitlin's lover, they met in The Wheatsheaf. Laying his head in her lap, a drunken Thomas proposed. Thomas liked to comment that he and Caitlin were in bed together ten minutes after they first met. Although Caitlin initially continued her relationship with John, she and Thomas began a correspondence, and in the second half of 1936 were courting.

"Mineral, Washington murders","The Mineral, Washington murders, dubbed by the media as ""the Tube Sock Killings,"" is a series of unsolved murders that occurred in remote areas of Lewis and Pierce County, Washington, near the remote community of Mineral, Washington, in 1985. The murder cases were widely publicized, and were featured on the television series Unsolved Mysteries in 1989.  Case  Harkins and Cooper On August 10, 1985, Steven Harkins, 27, and his girlfriend, Ruth Cooper, 42, left their Tacoma, Washington home for a weekend camping trip at Tule Lake in Pierce County. When the two did not return to their jobs at a Tacoma vocational school the following Monday, their families reported them missing. Four days later, on August 14, hikers passing through Pierce County found Harkins' body near a remote campsite. He had been shot in the head, and his body, still in a sleeping bag, suggested he had been murdered while sleeping. Nearby, searchers also found Harkins' and Cooper's pet dog, who had been shot to death as well. At the time, law enforcement suspected that the case may have been connected to the murders of Edward Smith and Kimberly Diane La Vine, a couple from Kent, Washington who were abducted, murdered, and disposed of in a gravel pit near the Columbia River in March 1985.  On October 26, a skull was found at the dead end of Eighth Avenue South, near Harts Lake, about   from where Harkins' body was found. Dental records confirmed the skull belonged to Cooper, and two days later on October 28, her body and her purse were also recovered from the area,  from where her skull had been found. A tube sock had been tied around Cooper's neck. According to the autopsy, Cooper had died of ""homicidal violence,"" though a spokesman later stated she had died of a gunshot wound to the abdomen. After the discovery of Cooper, the murders were publicized by Crime Stoppers in an attempt to recover information leading to the arrest of those responsible.  Riemer and Robertson  Over a month after the discovery of Ruth Cooper, on December 12, 1985, Mike Riemer, 36, his girlfriend, Diana Robertson, 21, and their daughter, Crystal Louise Robertson, age 2, traveled from their Tacoma home to Pierce County, planning to find a camp site near the Nisqually River. Riemer, an animal trapper, also planned to check on traps he had set in the area. Later that evening, customers at a Kmart store  north in Spanaway found the couple's daughter, Crystal, standing outside the store entrance. Crystal was placed in temporary foster care until her maternal grandmother saw her photograph on a local news broadcast two days later. When asked where her mother was, the dazed two-year-old told her grandmother that her ""Mommy was in the trees."" According to investigators, the two-year-old was ""not nearly verbal enough"" to provide any information.  Police searched the area both on foot and by air, looking for evidence of Riemer's red 1982 Plymouth pickup truck, but efforts remained fruitless. On February 18, 1986, over two months after the couple's disappearance, the body of Diana Robertson was discovered half-buried in snow by a motorist near a logging road off of Washington State Route 7 in Mineral. Bloodhounds scoured the area in the following days, but  of snowfall impeded the search. Riemer's pickup truck was also found near Robertson's body.  In the truck, police discovered a note on the dashboard that read ""I love you, Diana."" It was written on a manila envelope. Robertson's mother claimed the handwriting was that of Riemer. Bloodstains were also found on the seat of the truck. An autopsy revealed that Diana Robertson had been stabbed seventeen times, and, as with Ruth Cooper, was also found with a tube sock tied around her neck.  Due to Riemer's disappearance, investigators believed he may have been responsible for Robertson's murder, and had abandoned his daughter at the Kmart store and then subsequently fled. Police theorized that Riemer may have been responsible for Harkins' and Cooper's murders as well; an alternate theory, however, claimed that Riemer was also a victim of the same killer who had murdered Robertson, Harkins, and Cooper.  In February 1986, after the discovery of Robertson's body, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer published an article revealing that Riemer had been charged with domestic assault against Robertson on October 19, 1985. However, the couple had reconciled by December, the month in which they disappeared. Riemer, who worked as a roofer at Seattle’s Queen City Sheet Metal and Roofing Inc., was described by his employer as a ""typical roofer who worked hard and played hard.""  2011 development On March 26, 2011, hikers discovered a partial human skull later determined to be that of Mike Riemer. It was found in an area within a mile radius of where Robertson's body had been discovered in 1986. After recovery of the skull, Lewis County investigators stated that they believed Riemer could have been a possible victim of homicide as well, though his cause of death could not be determined. Based on the condition of the skull, however, authorities were able to rule out a gunshot wound to the head.

Energy efficient mortgage,"An energy efficient mortgage (EEM) (or ""green mortgage"") is a loan product that allows borrowers to reduce their utility bill costs by allowing them to finance the cost of incorporating energy-efficient features into a new housing purchase or the refinancing of existing housing.  Borrowers who qualify for an EEM need to complete a home inspection by an energy rater working off qualification standards created by the U.S. Department of Energy. The results of this energy audit can then be used when applying for an EEM.  First introduced in 1980, EEMs are currently sponsored by all mortgage programs insured by the U.S. federal government. To date, the popularity of the product has been somewhat limited: The New York Times estimates less than 1% of all U.S. home loans are EEMs.  References  External links   U.S. Department of Housing & Urban Development's Energy Efficient Mortgages Program  CNN coverage of EEMs   Mortgage Energy conservation","An energy-efficient home is one that has been designed, built or renovated to use less energy than conventional homes in similar climates and conditions. Energy efficiency can be achieved by using more insulation (thermal mass), better windows, improved heating systems such as heat pumps instead of furnaces, solar panels on the roofs etc., which all lead to lower utility bills over time.  Energy-efficient houses are also known as ""green houses"" because they have low environmental impact during their life cycle from design through construction until demolition/recycling at end-of-life compared to traditional housing designs.   The U.S Department of Housing & Urban Development defines green building as: ""A building that uses resources efficiently throughout its lifecycle while minimizing negative impacts on human health and the environment.

Cursor grass mouse,"The cursor grass mouse or cursorial akodont (Akodon cursor), is a sigmodontine rodent from South America.  Description The cursor grass mouse is a moderately sized rodent, with a head-body length of , and a tail  long. Males are larger than females, weighing an average of , compared with  for females. They have a typical mouse-like appearance, with short whiskers and stubby claws on the feet. They have dark to golden brown fur over most of their body, with paler greyish or yellowish underparts. Some have a whitish spot between the ears, but this is not present on all individuals.  Cursor grass mice are members of the A. cursor species group, and very similar in appearance to other members of the group. In particular, they cannot easily be distinguished from the closely related montane grass mouse, which inhabits neighbouring regions to the immediate south. Although the cursor grass mouse is, on average, slightly larger than the montane species, there is too much overlap for this to be a reliable guide. Instead, they can most readily be distinguished by the presence of a gall bladder in A. cursor (absent in the montane species), by karyotypic analysis, or by means of PCR based techniques.  Distribution and habitat The exact geographic range of the cursor grass mouse is disputed. It is definitively known to inhabit eastern Brazil from Paraiba to Paraná, where it lives in patches of tropical Atlantic Forest and restinga scrubland at elevations from sea level to . Some sources also report it as being found further south, in extreme southern Brazil, in eastern Paraguay, and in northern Argentina. These latter sources lack a definitive genetic analysis of the individuals identified, and it has been argued that they may represent members of other species, such as the montane grass mouse. No subspecies are recognised.  Biology and behaviour Cursor grass mice are omnivorous. Their primary diet consists of small arthropods, especially Hymenoptera, beetles, and spiders; this is supplemented by seeds of Cecropia and other plants. They search for food through leaf litter and patches of dense vegetation, and are strictly terrestrial. Individuals have a home range of , with the ranges of males being larger than those of females. Although the size of their home ranges does not change, the population density of cursor grass mice becomes significantly higher during the rainy season, when insects are most abundant.  Cursor grass mice breed throughout the year, although most births occur during the dry season between June and September. Pregnant females construct globular nests, and give birth to a litter of two to nine young, with an average of four, after a gestation period of 23 days.  This species is particularly important for public health since it has been implied as a Hantavirus reservoir.  A cell line derived from a liposarcoma in a cursor grass mouse has been used by biomedical scientists in the construction of a panel for the identification of human chromosomes in hybrid cells.

"Riversdale, Western Cape","Riversdale () is a town located on the N2 highway between Cape Town and George on the Agulhas Coastal Plain of the southern Western Cape province of South Africa.  It is an agricultural service oriented town, being a hub for shopping and other services for surrounding farming communities, smaller towns, and coastal resorts, like Witsand and Stilbaai.  It is located beneath the imposing Langeberg Mountains to the north, with Sleeping Beauty Mountain overlooking the town.  History The town was founded as a church on the farm, Doornkraal, and was subsequently named after Harry Rivers, the then incumbent Civil Commissioner of Swellendam.  It was proclaimed a town on 30 August 1838.  Riverdale is the seat of the Hessequa Local Municipality.  It is also sometimes considered the westernmost point in the Garden Route region.

The town was founded by Huguenot settlers from France who arrived at St Helena Island (now called Saint Helena) off the coast of East London during 1688–1689 as part of French privateer Jacques Cassard's fleet.  The name Riversdale comes from the English translation of the Dutch word ""rivierdell"" meaning ""by the river banks"".   It has been suggested that this may be where the first European settlement took place after the arrival of Captain James Cook to the east coast of southern Africa in 1778.    In 1820, it became one of three towns established along the south-east coastline between Port Elizabeth and East London under British rule; these were intended to protect against attacks by Arab slave traders operating out of Zanzibar.

Reinberg,"Reinberg is a village and in the municipality of Sundhagen and lies between Stralsund and Greifswald on the B 105 federal road in northeastern Germany. To the north the former municipality of Reinberg borders on the Strelasund From the village of Stahlbrode that used to belong to it, there is a car ferry to the island of Rügen (Zudar peninsula).  History  In 1220 construction began on the church and in 1325 Reinberg was mentioned for the first time in the records.  On the dissolution of the Principality of Rügen in 1325, the village transferred to the Duchy of Pomerania.  From the end of the Thirty Years' War to the year 1815 the region belonged to Swedish Pomerania and thereafter to the Prussian Province of Pomerania.  Until 1952 Reinberg was part of the district of Grimmen within the Bezirk of Rostock to 1994. Since 1990 it has also bee part of the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.  On 7 June 2009 the hitherto independent municipality of Reinsberg merged with those of Behnkendorf, Brandshagen, Horst, Kirchdorf, Miltzow and Wilmshagen to form the new municipality of Sundhagen. The former municipality consists of the villages of Oberhinrichshagen, Falkenhagen, Dömitzow and Stahlbrode.  Sights  Amongst the sights of Reinberg are its Gothic village church, the Sühnestein monument on the cemetery wall that dates to the 15th century and the Reinberg Lime, which was the largest tree in Germany in the 19th century. The age of the tree is around 1,000 years. It is possible that the lime had been planted before the foundation and consecration of the church. Near the tree is the grave of the father of surgeons, Theodor Billroth.  The Sühnestein (""Atonement Stone"") has a kneeling figure with hands clasped, next to Christ on the cross. Above the cross, between two roses, are the initials ""J.N.R.J."" and the words: ""domini miserere mei"". The weathered inscription above the crucified Jesus probably originally ran: ""orate pro ravno van barneko"". It may also be read as ""orate pro heyno van der beken"", however there is no record of a van der Beken family. The princely councillor and  Landvogt, Raven Barnekow, however, was sentenced to death and executed in Stralsund in 1453 as a result of false allegations. This suggests this expiatory cross (Sühnekreuz) was erected in his memory.

Willie Wallace,"William Semple Brown Wallace (born 23 June 1940) is a Scottish former football player and coach. He won the European Cup with Celtic in 1967 along with several domestic honours. His other clubs included Stenhousemuir, Raith Rovers, Heart of Midlothian and Dumbarton in the Scottish leagues, and Crystal Palace in English football.  Wallace played for Scotland seven times and was inducted into the national Hall of Fame in 2017 for his club achievements.  Club career  Early career He started his senior playing career with Stenhousemuir as a teenager in 1958 (having played alongside Jim Storrie at Kilsyth Rangers), moving to Raith Rovers a year later. It was in Kirkcaldy that ""Wispy"", as Wallace was nicknamed, developed his reputation as a top-class goal poacher, his skills being rewarded with a first Scottish League cap.  Hearts Wallace's form attracted attention from larger clubs, Heart of Midlothian eventually spending £15,000 to take him to Edinburgh in April 1961. The increased pressure for success at Tynecastle initially curtailed his scoring exploits, for he was expected to replace no less a figure than Alex Young, the ""Golden Vision"", whom Hearts had sold to Everton a couple of months earlier. By season 1962–63, however, Wallace was fully settled into the tactics of manager Tommy Walker, and he would become Hearts' top scorer for the next four seasons through to 1965–66. In doing so, he helped Hearts win the Scottish League Cup in 1962 and come within a goal of winning the 1964–65 Scottish Football League title, while gaining full international recognition for Scotland.  In 1966, however, his form plummeted and his goalscoring ceased and, amid rumours that he had been ""tapped"" up by another club, his departure from Tynecastle was widely anticipated. The surprise was that his destination wasn't boyhood favourites Rangers but their nemesis Celtic, for whom Jock Stein paid £30,000 to secure his services. He played a total of 248 matches for Hearts in all competitions, scoring 131 goals.  Celtic Within six months of joining Celtic, Wallace was to attain Scottish footballing immortality, as one of the ""Lisbon Lions"", the famous team who won the European Cup in 1967. He was later part of the team that reached the 1970 European Cup Final but was defeated 2–1 by Feyenoord. He also won the league championship in each of the four seasons he was at the Glasgow club, plus the Scottish Cup in 1967, 1969 and 1971 and the League Cup in 1968 and 1968 during an era widely considered the greatest in the club's history. In total, he scored 140 goals for Celtic in 239 games.  Later career After five fruitful years with Celtic, Wallace and team-mate John Hughes were sold to Crystal Palace in October 1971 for a combined fee of £30,000. Neither enjoyed great success in Croydon and Wallace was back in Scotland with Dumbarton less than a year later. As his career wound down, he moved to Australia in March 1975 to play for APIA, where he won two league titles before returning to Scotland in March 1977, first to Partick Thistle for a week, before becoming player-coach at Ross County for the rest of the 1976–77 season.  International career In total, Wallace was capped seven times for Scotland and four times for the Scottish Football League XI. He was part of the Scotland team that defeated England at Wembley in 1967.  Career after retirement Retiring as a player in June 1977, he joined the coaching staff at Dundee. When this role ended he returned to APIA as a coach, eventually settling in Sydney and starting his own sports shop.  In 2008, Tommy Burns, a former Celtic player and manager, died; Wallace helped organise a tribute match played on 31 May 2009 at Celtic Park, attended by over 35,000 people. The Celtic squad of the time defeated the 'Tommy Burns Select' team 11–4. In July of the same year, Wallace arranged a friendly match in Australia (where he had lived for the past 30 years) between Celtic and the local professional club Brisbane Roar; Celtic won 3–0.

Chaesang,"Chaesang  are woven boxes or baskets constructed from strips of bamboo. The art of constructing such baskets (chaesang-jang) is represented by the sole surviving master craftsman, Seo Han-gyu, who, along with the art itself, is one of the Important Intangible Cultural Properties of Korea.  Historically, chaesang were used by women of the Korean aristocracy to store clothing or jewels. They were constructed by married couples, and were often used to store the items needed for a daughter's dowry.  Construction First, the craftsman peels long strips from a bamboo plant, using his teeth. The strips are cut to length, arranged in a thin layer, soaked in water, and dyed using natural pigments. The strips are then woven together in various designs, each with a symbolic meaning, and the ends are trimmed. Each box is covered with silk or satin, and finally, a double layer of paper is used to line the base. Chaesang are usually created in nested groups of three, although five or even seven nested boxes are not unheard of. It can take two weeks, or even as long as a month to produce a set.

Nel Erasmus,"Nel Erasmus (born 1928 in Bethal, Transvaal Province, South Africa) is a South African artist.  Erasmus once stated, “I am happiest when heart and head seem to walk a tightrope on the canvas – where feeling and thought seem to be in tension. For me these two sometimes manage to contain me and my shadow, my heart and my head…”.  Erasmus studied at the Académie Ranson, Ecole des Beaux Arts and the Sorbonne in Paris in 1953 and exhibited her works for the first time in Paris in 1955. Her first solo exhibition was in South Africa in 1957 and she is one of the earliest abstract artists of South Africa. Erasmus has produced thirty solo exhibitions, taken part in more than seventy group exhibitions and her writing has been widely published. Although Erasmus was never a ‘popular’ painter, her work received much critical acclaim and she was the only South African artist to be included in Michel Seuphor’s 1964 survey of abstraction, Abstract Painting: 50 Years of Accomplishment.  Three other South Africans who spent time with Erasmus in Paris in the early 1950s and who appeared to have been inspired by the intuitive processes of post-war abstract painting in Paris were Christo Coetzee, Paul du Toit, and Eric Loubser.  Abstract Art in Africa  Nel Erasmus was an early proponent of Abstract Art in South Africa – both as a practice and a principle. Erasmus also influenced the South African art scene as director of the Johannesburg Art Gallery (JAG) (1966–1977).  The New Church Museum curator Marilyn Martin, who curated the Museum's Thinking, Feeling, Head, Heart exhibition, describes Erasmus' abstract content through two of her works, Space Dance II and Whirlwind, which are both characterised by brightly coloured forms in flux.  Martin says, “The time bound object dissolves and reshapes itself into symbols, images and signs, which it actually and secretly contains within itself. These signs can point more directly towards the essence of a thing, its energy; its relatedness to things other than itself.""  Education and influencers   1950 University of the Witwatersrand, BA Fine Arts (under Joyce Leonard and Heather Martienssen, with Christo Coetzee, Gordon Vorster, Cecil Skotnes, and Larry Scully)  1952 National Arts Teacher’s Certificate, Wits Technikon  1952 Private study under Gina Berndtson  Henry Focillon’s La vie des Formes - Nel Erasmus calls this book the “bible” for her work.

She has contributed to the acquisition of artworks to public and corporate (especially Sanlam and Sasol) collections in South Africa, in particular the international modern and contemporary collection at the Johannesburg Art Gallery (JAG).  Erasmus’ notorious acquisition in 1973, the year Picasso died, of Pablo Picasso’s Tête d’Arlequin (1971) was made possible by funding from The Friends of the Museum organization. The acquisition of this painting of a clown met with resistance from conservative, censored, isolated, apartheid South Africa, “No normal person would like this painting”, and provoked Erasmus to write a paper about why the acquisition was made.  Nel Erasmus writes in response to visitors to Picasso’s Tête d’Arlequin, that art is not there to please or depict, it is there to reveal. Erasmus says that because Picasso had such an impact on art in our times, museums should have an example of his work in their permanent collections. With this acquisition JAG now had an example of Picasso’s mature post-cubist work. Erasmus asks the public not to refer to the painting as that of a clown, but as a harlequin and so give him the respect he is due.  Erasmus explained that it was policy of other art museums in South Africa to make collections of South African art and JAG did have a policy to focus on international art. During her tenure she also grew the South African collection extensively. By 1975 an exhibition of 40 artists was held of JAG's holdings.  Current work  Nel Erasmus is in her 80s and still paints daily. The most recent exhibitions she has participated in were solo exhibitions in 2009 in the Dawid Ras Art Gallery (Johannesburg) and in 2015 in the Dawid Ras Gallery (Cape Town), and since then various group exhibitions.

Jürgen Mulert,"Jürgen Mulert (August 16, 1938 – December 28, 2008) was an economist, Fulbright Scholar, and Acting Director General of the German-American Fulbright Program.  The ""Mulert Memorial Award on Mutual Understanding"" is granted annually in his honor.  Early life and education  In 1948, Mulert and his family (father, mother, three brothers and an older sister) fled from East Germany and took refuge with the grandparents in Wiesbaden. Later the family moved to Herrenberg by Stuttgart, where Mulert earned his high school diploma in 1958. Afterwards he served four years in the German Military. From 1962 to 1967 he studied economics at the Rheinischen Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität in Bonn. Afterwards he went to Fort Collins with a Fulbright Scholarship to Colorado State University, and he extended his stay with a Teaching Assistant position and earned his Ph.D. in Economics in 1972.  Professional career  In 1973 the family moved to Heidelberg where Mulert taught Business Administration. His research focussed on the role of Robert Bosch as social entrepreneur. From 1975 to 1986 he was in charge of the German Program Unit at the German American Fulbright Commission in Bonn, in 1975/76 and 1980/81 Mulert served as Acting Director General. In 1987, Mulert moved to Frankfurt to work at the City University. In 1991, he founded the ""Institut für Internationale Studien"" in Erfurt, as well as the ‘Verein zur Förderung von Auslandskontakten’ in 1993. Both  organizations aimed at improving intercultural communication.  German Fulbright Alumni Association  Mulert was the initiator of the first Fulbright Alumni Association outside the US, based in Frankfurt, Germany. He inspired hundreds of former grantees, so that on January 24, 1986, the founding documents of the German Fulbright Alumni association were signed. The association nowadays has appr. 1.300 members from 30 countries.  Legacy  As a former Fulbright Fellow, he believed in Senator J. William Fulbright's idea of ""waging peace through understanding"". Professionally, he supported thousands of students and professors before, during and after their academic exchange from and to the USA. In his personal life, he tirelessly campaigned for an improvement of transatlantic relations.

Yuval Cherlow,"Yuval Cherlow (born 1957) is a Modern Orthodox rabbi and posek. He is Rosh Yeshiva of Yeshivat Hesder Amit Orot Shaul in Tel Aviv, Israel. Cherlow was one of the founders of Tzohar, an organization of religious Zionist Orthodox rabbis in Israel.  Biography  Yuval Cherlow was born in Herzliya, Israel. His parents were American-Jewish immigrants who moved to Israel in 1949. He was educated in Yeshivat Har Etzion. As part of his Hesder studies, he served as an armor officer in the IDF. In the reserves he was a company commander in the armoured corps. He lives in Efrat with his wife, who is a lecturer in the department of Jewish philosophy in Bar Ilan University.  Rabbinic career  Cherlow's rabbinic career began in Kibbutz Tirat Tzvi, where he served as a rabbi and teacher. Later he served as a rabbi in Yeshivat HaGolan in Hispin, in the southern Golan Heights. After the Rabin assassination, he helped found Tzohar, whose aim was to lessen the tensions between religious and non-religious communities. In 1998 he founded a Yeshivat Hesder in Petach Tikva, later to become Yeshivat Hesder Amit Orot Shaul in Kfar Batya, Raanana. He justified his decision to start a new yeshiva in the central area of Israel by saying that it is the place where the most important debates about the identity of the country take place.  Since 2001 Cherlow has answered more than 30,000 questions about Halakha and other issues related to Judaism via the Moreshet website. He published two books based on his internet responsa. He has also published books that deal with Bible commentary as well as the writings of Rabbi Avraham Yitzhak Kook.  Cherlow is a member of the ethics committee of the Israeli Ministry of Health and the committee which allocates the budget for new drugs. He is active in the BeMaagalei Tzedek (""Circles of Justice"") movement. In 2011, he took part in the Israeli social justice protests.  Views and opinions  Cherlow has voiced empathy for the difficulties faced by religious homosexual people, and has called for the Orthodox community to treat them with compassion. However, he still maintains that homosexual relationships are prohibited by Halakha. Cherlow has voiced liberal positions on some issues, such as allowing the use of artificial insemination by unmarried women in certain circumstances and supporting coed activities in Bnei Akiva. His view on Jewish marriage in Israel is that all Jews should be married according to Halakha, but if the Chief Rabbinate refuses to marry a couple, there should be an alternate method of being recognized as a couple according to secular law. He is opposed to civil disobedience, an issue that rose to the fore during Israel's unilateral disengagement from Gaza and evacuation of Israeli settlements in the region.  In 2012, Cherlow called on the State of Israel to recognise non-Orthodox streams of Judaism and Reform conversions. In response, Tzohar distanced itself from his remarks. Yizhar Hess of the Masorti Movement in Israel has suggested that Cherlow does not represent the mainstream of Zionist Orthodoxy in Israel, and Rabbi Yehoshua Shapira described Cherlow as a ""neo-Reform rabbi in the Orthodox sector.""  Cherlow is also interested in interfaith dialogue, and currently sits on the Board of World Religious Leaders for the Elijah Interfaith Institute.  Rabbi Cherlow deals mainly with ethical issues. He writes articles and tweets about ethics in Israel. In 2015, he established the ethics department at Tzohar. His book ""BeTzalmo"" (In His Image), published in 2015 by Maggid Press, deals with the religious meanings of God's image in people.  In March of 2018 he garnered attention for stating that genetically cloned pig or any other animal would be Kosher.

Plexon,"Plexon (from ""plexus,"" a term describing a network of nerve cells) is an American company that ""invents, develops, and manufactures hardware and software that acquires, amplifies, records, and analyzes signals from individual brain cells.""  It is based in Dallas, Texas and is very close to the campus of Southern Methodist University with a satellite office in Brussels, Belgium.  It primarily services academic researchers doing work in neuroscience and electrophysiology. Plexon equipment has been used in ""areas of study including autism, prosthetic limb control for paralysis patients, and the effects of drugs on brain processing and memory."" In addition, it also develops equipment and software for behavioral video tracking.  History Harvey Wiggins of Dallas, Texas founded Spectrum Scientific in 1983.  In the early days of Spectrum Scientific, design and manufacturing was conducted solely by Wiggins with backing and most funding being provided by Don Woodward at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School and the National Institutes of Health.  In 1988, the original Multichannel Data Acquisition system (abbreviated as MAP or ""Harvey box"") was developed and uses hardware filtering of data signals.  The replacement for the MAP, the Omniplex system, was released in 2009 and replaces the hardware filtering components with filtering in software. Due to many contributions like these, Plexon and Harvey Wiggins have become iconic in the neuroscience community.  Dr. Regina Carelli, a professor of psychology at the University of North Carolina, describes Harvey as ""wonderful--A scientist much more than a salesman.""  Spectrum Scientific became known as Plexon in 1996.  Plexon celebrated its 30th anniversary in February 2013.

Neuse River waterdog,"The Neuse River waterdog, Necturus lewisi, is a medium-sized waterdog, family Proteidae, found in two rivers of North Carolina.  Range The range of the Neuse River waterdog is limited to the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico River basins in the eastern Piedmont and Coastal Plain of North Carolina.  Appearance and physiology N. lewisi has a rusty-brown dorsal side with many large, bluish-black spots. The ventral side is dark brown to grey and also spotted. The snout is compressed dorsally and truncated. The tail is compressed laterally and ridged. Each hind limb has four toes, and the gills are dull red and bushy. Sexually active males have sowled cloacae and two enlarged cloacal papillae that point to the rear. Males and females are of a similar size. Adults measure 16.5–28.0 cm from the tip of snout to tip of tail. The young possess a dorsal stripe along their length along with a dark lateral stripe.  Males and females become sexually mature after reaching 102 mm and 100 mm, respectively, measured from tip of the snout to the posterior end of the cloaca. This size is reached at 5.5 years in males and 6.5 years in females.  Habitat  Neuse River waterdogs prefer streams with a flow >10 cm/s and streams which are >15 m wide, and 1 m deep, in areas with a hard clay or soil bottom, as well as areas covered with leaf bed. Larvae are found in leaf beds of quieter waters which provide cover and foraging sites. Males have a greater range than females, and both males and females increase their range after moderate rains, but decrease it after large rains (>40 mm). During winter, adults mostly reside in burrows in banks or under granite rocks. During the spring, the adults move to large bedrock outcrops or beneath large boulders in relatively fast current where nesting occurs. Home ranges contain animal burrows or rock overhangs, large flat rocks on sand gravel substrates, and slack-water areas with detritus mats of leaves.  Adults create retreats by shoveling sand and gravel with their snouts, forming a cavity beneath cover objects. Sometimes, gravel is picked up in the mouth and moved to the periphery of the retreat. Entrances to these retreats face downstream. Females, and to a lesser extent males, actively defend their retreats from intruders. Threat displays include flaring and pulsating the gills and curling the upper lip. Intruders which do not flee after this display are attacked and bitten, usually on the end of the tail.  Reproduction Males have sperm in the vasa deferentia from November through May, and females have been found with this sperm from December through May. Females move to nesting sites beneath fast-moving current during the spring. Oviposition occurs in April and May, corresponding to the time when ovarian eggs reach their maximum size. Eggs are 8–9 mm in diameter and attach to the substrate by a blunt stalk.  Courtship A pair of Neuse River waterdogs crawl slowly, with the male trailing the female by 2–4 cm. The male positions his snout behind the rear legs of the female when she stops. The female has her gills flared, while the male has his close to the neck.  The male then moves across her body at the base of her tail. Once parallel, the male begins to stroke the female with his chin. This stroking begins at the top of the head, moves roughly halfway down the female and back to the head. The female then raises her head each time the male's chin contacts her neck or head. This sequence repeats many times over a period of roughly 18 minutes. The male then circles the female in a clockwise direction while maintaining contact with her. After several slow circles are made, the males moves parallel to the female and places his limbs over her back. The pair remains in this position for 30 minutes and retreats.  Diet and feeding Adults feed from the mouths of their retreats or move about in search of prey at night. Olfaction and sight play important roles in locating food. Animals are active away from cover at night, and also during raised water levels and increased turbidity. Individuals are inactive when stream temperatures exceed 18 °C.  Adults mainly prey on snails, earthworms, isopods, amphipods, mayflies, stoneflies, caddisflies, true flies, and fish. Other prey include: slugs, leeches, spiders, crayfish, centipedes, millipedes, odonates, hellgrammites, beetles, caterpillars, and salamanders. Prey of larvae are mainly ostracods, copepods, mayflies, true flies, and beetles. Other prey items of larva include: earthworms, caldocerans, isopods, amphipods, collembolans, odonates, and stoneflies along with other insects.  Predation Mainly preyed on by fish, Neuse River waterdogs produce chemical defenses to ward off these predators.  References Petranka, James W.

Hasan Awad,"Hasan ʿAwad al-Qatshan (born 1912–13) was a Bedouin archaeologist associated with the Jordanian Department of Antiquities. Working with his partner Gerald Lankester Harding and other western archaeologists, he played a role in a number of major discoveries, including those of the Lachish letters and the Dead Sea Scrolls.  Archaeological career  ʿAwad was born to the Negev Bedouin Hanajira of Beersheba. Though not formally educated in archaeology, he began his training as a teenager, on Flinders Petrie's excavations at Tell Jemmeh (1926–1927). He went on to acquire a reputation as a skilled excavator and the ""best archaeological foreman in Jordan"", working with James Leslie Starkey at Tell ed-Duweir (Lachish, 1932–1939), George Ernest Wright at Tell Balata (Shechem, 1956–1973), the American Schools of Oriental Research at Dhiban (1950–1953), Henri de Contenson at Tell esh-Shuna (1953), and Diana Kirkbride at Petra (1955–1956). Harding credited ʿAwad with the discovery of the Lachish letters, and he was the first archaeologist to recognise the importance of the El-Kerak Inscription, which he bought from a Bedouin in Tafilah.  ʿAwad's most frequent collaborator was Gerald Lankester Harding, who he first met at Tell Jemmeh. They were partners for nearly twenty years and lived together in Amman, where Harding was the director of the Department of Antiquities. ʿAwad conducted a excavated a number of sites in Jordan on Harding's behalf, including the Iron Age tombs at Sahab. In 1952, Harding heard that local Bedouin had found a new cave at Qumran Caves, the site of the discovery the Dead Sea Scrolls. ʿAwad joined Harding's expedition to the caves along with Dominique Barthélemy, Józef Milik, Henri de Contenson, Roland de Vaux, Azmi Khalil, and Ibrahim Assula, and was responsible for supervising the party's Bedouin labourers.

Romaine Sawyers,"Romaine Theodore Sawyers (born 2 November 1991) is a Kittitian professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for  club Stoke City, on loan from West Bromwich Albion. He plays international football for the Saint Kitts and Nevis national team.  A West Bromwich Albion academy graduate, he had brief spells on loan at Port Vale, Shrewsbury Town and Walsall. He signed with Walsall in July 2013, following his release from West Brom. He played on the losing side in the 2015 final of the Football League Trophy. He was named in League One's PFA Team of the Year for his performances in the 2015–16 season. He joined Brentford in July 2016 and went on to serve as club captain before he returned to West Bromwich Albion for an undisclosed fee in July 2019. He helped the club to win promotion out of the Championship at the end of the 2019–20 season and was also named in the PFA Team of the Year. West Brom were relegated the following year and he was loaned out to Stoke City for the 2021–22 season.  Early life Sawyers was raised by Diane, a single mother who also raised foster children and did many hours of community work in Birmingham. She remained a big influence on her son, who went on to work closely with the community development teams at his football clubs, as well as with the charity Kick It Out.  Club career  West Bromwich Albion Sawyers first made the West Bromwich Albion substitute bench for the final game of the 2008–09 season. Following this, he won his first professional contract with the club. However, he spent most of the 2009–10 season nursing a knee injury. On 21 January 2011, he joined Jim Gannon's Port Vale on a one-month loan, along with Kayleden Brown. He made his debut for the League Two club two days later, in a 1–0 defeat to Cheltenham Town at Vale Park, replacing Adam Yates. However this was to be his only game for the club, as the pair returned to The Hawthorns after the loan spell ended with Sawyers having made no further first team appearances.  On 27 January 2012, he joined Graham Turner's League Two Shrewsbury Town on a one-month loan, and the following day he was named as an unused substitute for the 2–0 win at Hereford United. He made his first league start against Torquay United at Plainmoor on 11 February. On 25 February, it was announced his loan had been extended until the end of the 2011–12 season. In total he made two starts and five substitute appearances for Shrewsbury.  Walsall Sawyers joined League One club Walsall on loan in March 2013; manager Dean Smith said that ""He's a talented lad who can play-off the front-man... I know that Albion rate him highly, so it's good to have him on board."" He made four substitute appearances for the club. He was released by West Brom in June 2013. Following his release from West Brom, Sawyers signed a permanent one-year deal at Walsall in July 2013; Dean Smith stated that he saw potential and an excellent attitude in the player despite his limited playing time on loan. On 17 August 2013, he marked his first senior start for Walsall with his first goal from 25 yards in a 1–1 draw with Notts County at the Bescot Stadium. He finished the 2013–14 season with seven goals in 49 appearances, and signed a new two-year deal with the club.  On 13 September 2014, he was described as a ""shining light throughout"" in a 3–1 home win over Preston North End, earning a place on the Football League team of the week. He played in the 2015 final of the Football League Trophy, a 2–0 defeat to Bristol City, which was Walsall's first appearance at Wembley Stadium. In total he scored five goals in 51 appearances in the 2014–15 season, and was praised by manager Smith despite being criticised by some supporters. He won a place on the Football League team of the week after scoring a brace – including a ""25-yard rocket into the top corner of the net"" – in a 4–0 triumph at Blackpool on 29 August 2015. He was named in League One's PFA Team of the Year for his performances in the 2015–16 season, alongside teammate Rico Henry. He was also nominated for the PFA League One 'Player of the Year', and finished as runner-up to Gillingham's Bradley Dack. He rejected the club's offer a new contract and departed as a free agent at the end of the season.  Brentford On 1 July 2016, Sawyers signed with Championship club Brentford in a move that reunited him with former Walsall boss Dean Smith. He made his debut for the ""Bees"" in a 2–1 away defeat to Huddersfield Town on the opening day of the 2016–17 season. He scored his first goal for Brentford in a 2–0 win over West London derby rivals Queens Park Rangers on 28 October. He ended the 2016–17 campaign with three goals in 45 matches, helping Brentford a tenth-place finish as the key link between defence and attack. He scored five goals and contributed five assists in 44 appearances across the 2017–18 season as Brentford finished in ninth position, and was described as ""one of the standout players at Griffin Park this season with his touch and passing range impressing many"". He was voted Players' Player of the Year by the Brentford squad and was also named as Community Player of the Year.  He was reported to be a transfer target of West Bromwich Albion manager Darren Moore in June 2018. Soon after taking charge at Brentford, new manager Thomas Frank named Sawyers as the new club captain in November 2018. Frank moved Sawyers further down the pitch as part of two central midfielders with Kamohelo Mokotjo rather than as one of three. He made 46 appearances during the 2018–19 season and was linked with a move to Aston Villa in the summer.  Return to West Bromwich Albion On 27 July 2019, Sawyers returned to West Bromwich Albion, signing a three-year contract after being bought for an undisclosed fee (reported to be £2.9 million); Sawyers stated that ""this is the team that I have always wanted to play for"". Manager Slaven Bilić said that ""we targeted him as a player who will raise the quality in our midfield"". He chose to wear the #19 shirt in homage to former midfielder Jason Koumas. On 22 February 2020, he was sent off after putting his hand to the throat of former Walsall teammate Jamie Paterson during a 3–0 win at Bristol City. During break in play due to the COVID-19 pandemic in England, FourFourTwo magazine listed Sawyers as the ninth best player in the EFL. He ended the 2019–20 season with one goal in 43 appearances as the ""Baggies"" secured the Championship's second automatic promotion place. He was also named in the Championship's PFA Team of the Year.  On 29 December 2020, he scored what The Guardian's Paul Doyle described as a ""slapstick own goal"" in a 5–0 defeat to Leeds United at The Hawthorns. Sawyers took to Twitter to say that ""I take full responsibility for setting the tone for what went on to be a difficult night for us all to stomach!"" Sawyers barely featured in the second half of the 2020–21 season as the club suffered relegation under the stewardship of Sam Allardyce.  Loan to Stoke City On 20 August 2021, Sawyers joined Championship rivals Stoke City on loan for the 2021–22 season. Manager Michael O'Neill stated that ""we didn't anticipate that Romaine would become available"" but acted quickly to sign Sawyers after he had fallen behind Jake Livermore and Alex Mowatt in the pecking order at West Brom.  International career Sawyers represented Saint Kitts and Nevis national under-23 football team in the second round of the Caribbean Football Union's qualifying phase for the 2012 CONCACAF Men's Olympic Qualifying Championship. In the three games the team played, he scored four goals. He was called up to the full team for the qualification for the 2012 Caribbean Cup. He scored a goal and claimed an assist on his debut, in a 2–0 win over Anguilla at the Warner Park Sporting Complex in Basseterre.  Style of play Sawyers has a languid style of play, which can make him appear lazy at times despite statistics indicating a relatively high work rate. He can play as an attacking midfielder, playmaker or as a central midfielder. He played most his career as a 'number 10' under his former manager Dean Smith who managed him at Walsall and Brentford, before being converted into a central midfielder under Manager Thomas Frank at Brentford who also made him captain due to his leadership qualities. Sawyers is known for his ability to dictate games from midfield, his range of passing, and his ability to carry out successful difficult passes and help his team-mates start attacks.  Personal life In January 2021, a 49-year-old man from Kingswinford was arrested after a racist message was sent to Sawyers on social media during West Brom's loss to Manchester City. In September 2021, the man was jailed for eight weeks.  Career statistics  Club  International  International goals Scores and results list Saint Kitts and Nevis' goal tally first.

Cast King,"Joseph D. ""Cast"" King (February 16, 1926 – December 13, 2007) was a country musician and songwriter from Old Sand Mountain, Alabama. King released the album, ""Saw Mill Man"", in 2005. He was aged 79 at the time of recording. A song from the album entitled ""Outlaw"" was included in the score of Gus Van Sant's 2007 film, Paranoid Park. ""Saw Mill Man"" drew comparisons to Johnny Cash's American Recordings series. King's baritone voice and acoustic guitar have been praised as possessing a raw and affecting quality. The narratives of the songs dealt with characteristic country themes such as poverty, broken relationships, and murderous outlaws. Although his opportunity to record a full-length album came late in life, Cast King had previously recorded for Sun Records in 1955. With his band, The Country Drifters, he cut around a dozen songs at this time. It was musician, Matt Downer, who located King and encouraged him to come out of a long musical retirement and record. Downer also played electric guitar throughout ""Saw Mill Man"". The record was met with favourable reviews from Rolling Stone, Arthur Magazine, Mojo, and No Depression among other publications. King was preparing a second collection of songs when it was discovered that he was suffering from cancer. He died at the age of 81 on December 13, 2007.

Harry Hiestand,"Harry Hiestand (born November 19, 1958) is an American football coach who is currently the offensive line coach at the University of Notre Dame. Hiestand earned his bachelor's degree in health and physical education from East Stroudsburg University in 1983. He and his wife, Terri, have three sons, Michael, Matthew and Mark, and one daughter, Sarah.  He previously coached the at University of Tennessee and University of Notre Dame. Hiestand has also coached at East Stroudsburg University, University of Pennsylvania, University of Southern California, University of Toledo, University of Cincinnati, University of Missouri, University of Illinois. Professionally, he served as an offensive line coach for the Chicago Bears on two stints.  Playing career Hiestand played college football as an offensive lineman at Springfield College and East Stroudsburg between 1978 and 1980. He played at the latter alongside future New York Giants offensive line coach Pat Flaherty, but injuries shortened his playing career in his junior year.  Coaching career  Early career In his first coaching jobs, Hiestand was an offensive line coach at Toledo (1988), graduate assistant coach at Southern California (1987) and tight ends and assistant line coach at Penn (1986). He began his coaching career at his alma mater, East Stroudsburg University, after an injury ended his playing days. Hiestand has been a part of league championship teams at five of his seven stops, at East Stroudsburg (1982–83), Penn (1986), USC (1987), Cincinnati (1993) and Illinois (2001). He was on the Trojan staff at the 1988 Rose Bowl.  Cincinnati Hiestand came to the University of Cincinnati in 1989 after a year at Toledo. He served as run game coordinator with the Bearcats in 1992 and offensive coordinator in 1993.  As offensive coordinator, running back David Small broke Cincinnati's record for rushing touchdowns while the offense posted the 7th most points in school history.  Cincinnati's 1993 team went 8-3 after a 3-8 record the previous campaign.  Missouri After a five-year stint at Cincinnati, went to the University of Missouri. With the Tigers, Hiestand helped MU to a No. 9 national ranking in rushing at 250.7 yards per game in 1996. In that same year, three of Hiestand's offensive lineman garnered All-Big 12 honors.  Illinois From 1997–2004, Hiestand served as offensive line coach in Ron Turner's system and also was assistant head coach from 2000 until his departure.  During his tenure, Hiestand has produced 10 All-Big Ten selections on the offensive line. In 2002, Illinois marched out one of the nation's most balanced offensive attacks thanks in large part to Hiestand's offensive front. Illinois topped 5,300 yards in total offense for the first time in school history and running back Antoineo Harris topped the Illinois single season rushing yardage list with 1,330 yards. Seniors Tony Pashos and David Diehl each earned All-Big Ten accolades, and were fifth-round picks in the 2003 NFL Draft.   In 2001, Hiestand tutored a pair of linemen to first team All-Big Ten accolades. Both Jay Kulaga and Pashos were named to the Big Ten's first team by the coaches and media, while senior center Luke Butkus was a second-team selection. Illinois topped the 5,000-yard total offense mark for the first time in school history.   In 2000, Marques Sullivan and Ray Redziniak earned second-team All-Big Ten honors for the second straight year and Sullivan was named to the Football Writers Association All-America third-team. That season the line allowed only 20 sacks, the 17th lowest in the nation.   In 1999, Hiestand's line led Illinois to the highest scoring offense in school history with 388 points scored in 12 games. The UI offensive line cleared paths for Illini running backs to rush for 2,082 yards and provided quarterback Kurt Kittner the room to throw for 2,702 yards and 24 touchdown passes. Sullivan and Redziniak earned second-team All-Big Ten honors.  During his tenure at Illinois, Hiestand tutored 12 all-Big Ten selections on the offensive line. Every senior starting offensive lineman in Hiestand's first seven years with the Illini was signed to an NFL contract: Ryan Schau (1995–98), J. P. Machado (1995–98), Marques Sullivan (1997–2000), Ray Redziniak (1997–2000), Luke Butkus (1998–2001), Dave Diehl (1999–2002), and Tony Pashos (1999–2002).  Chicago Bears Hiestand was hired on January 11, 2005 as Chicago’s offensive line coach. The Bears were one of six teams to have the same five offensive linemen start all 16 games in 2008 (C Olin Kreutz, LG Josh Beekman, RG Roberto Garza, LT John St. Clair and RT John Tait), marking the first time since 2001 that Chicago had the same five players start all 16 contests along the line.   The offensive line would become the most experienced unit on the Bears roster over the next couple of years, led by 11-year veteran and six-time Pro Bowl C Kreutz, who entered the 2009 season having started a team-high 102 consecutive games.   In 2008, Chicago’s offense attempted 557 pass plays and absorbed 29 sacks. In 2006, the Bears attempted 539 pass plays and allowed just 25 sacks, the lowest total given up by the team since allowing 17 in 2001, as Chicago went on to win the 2006 NFC Championship leading to the organization’s first Super Bowl appearance in 21 years.  Tennessee and Notre Dame  After spending two years coaching the offensive line at the University of Tennessee from 2010–2012, Hiestand was hired to the same post at the University of Notre Dame under head coach Brian Kelly. Since reaching the BCS National Championship Game during his first season at Notre Dame, Hiestand has developed a number of current and former NFL offensive linemen with the Fighting Irish, including:  Mike Golic Jr., Former Pittsburgh Steelers offensive guard   Braxston Cave, Former Detroit Lions center   Zack Martin, Dallas Cowboys offensive guard  Chris Watt, Former New Orleans Saints offensive guard   Ronnie Stanley, Baltimore Ravens offensive tackle   Nick Martin, Las Vegas Raiders offensive guard  Quenton Nelson, Indianapolis Colts offensive guard  Mike McGlinchey, San Francisco 49ers offensive tackle  Alex Bars, Chicago Bears offensive guard (graduated after 2018 season)  Sam Mustipher, Chicago Bears center (graduated after 2018 season)  Second stint with Bears On January 10, 2018, Hiestand returned to the Bears after being hired by new head coach Matt Nagy as the offensive line coach.  Under Hiestand, the 2018 Bears allowed 33 sacks, tied for the eighth-fewest in the NFL. Center Cody Whitehair and left tackle Charles Leno Jr. were named to their first Pro Bowl to become the first Bears offensive linemen teammates to make the all-star game since 2006.  In 2019, however, Chicago's offensive line allowed 43 sacks (12th most in the league) and helped the offense record just 91.1 rushing yards per game (sixth worst). Hiestand was fired on December 31.

Anna Swanwick,"Anna Swanwick (22 June 1813 – 2 November 1899) was an English author and feminist.  Life Anna Swanwick was the youngest daughter of John Swanwick and his wife, Hannah Hilditch. She was born in Liverpool on 22 June 1813.  The Swanwicks descended from Philip Henry, the 17th century nonconformist divine. Anna was educated chiefly at home, but, wishing to carry on her education beyond the typical age for girls in this country at that time, she went in 1839 to Berlin, where she studied German and Greek, and gained knowledge of Hebrew.  She returned to England in 1843 and began translating some of the German dramatists. Her first publication, Selections from the Dramas of Goethe and Schiller appeared in 1843. The selections included Goethe's Torquato Tasso and Iphigenia in Tauris, and Schiller's Maid of Orleans.  In 1850, she released a volume of translations from Goethe containing the first part of Faust, Egmont, and the two plays of the former volume. The translations are in blank verse.  In 1878, she published the second part of Faust; the two parts with Moritz Retzsch's illustrations appeared together in one volume the same year.  Miss Swanwick's Faust passed through many editions and was included in Bohn's series of translations from foreign classics. Her English version is accurate and spirited, and is regarded as one of the best in existence.   About 1850, Bunsen advised her to try her hand at translating from the Greek, with the result that in 1865 she published a blank-verse translation of the Trilogy of Aeschylus, and in 1873 of the whole of his dramas. The choruses are in rhymed metres. Her translation has passed through many editions and ranks high among English versions. It keeps fairly close to the original.   Miss Swanwick did not confine herself to literary work. She took a keen interest in many social issues of the day, especially women's education, and in raising the moral and intellectual tone of the working classes. She was a member of the councils both of Queen's College and Bedford College, London, and was for some time president of the latter.  She assisted in the founding of Girton College, Cambridge, and Somerville Hall, Oxford, and in extending the King's College lectures to women. To all these institutions she subscribed liberally. She was associated with Anthony John Mundella and Sir Joshua Girling Fitch in carrying out the provisions of the will of Mrs. Emily Jane Pfeiffer, who left in 1890 large sums of money for the promotion of the higher education of women. She strongly advocated the study of English literature in the universities, and herself lectured privately on the subject to young working men and women.   Miss Swanwick's life was thus divided between literary pursuits and active philanthropy. She never sought publicity, but her example and influence had an important and invigorating effect on women's education and on their position in the community. She signed John Stuart Mill's petition to parliament in 1865 for the political enfranchisement of women. The University of Aberdeen conferred on her the honorary degree of LL.D. She was a Unitarian. Miss Swanwick was the centre of a large circle of distinguished friends, who included Crabb Robinson, Tennyson, Browning, Gladstone, James Martineau, and Sir James Paget, and these, with many others, were frequent visitors at her house. Her marvellous memory made her a delightful talker, and she was full of anecdotes in her later years about the eminent persons she had known.   She died on 2 Nov. 1899 at Tunbridge Wells, and was buried in the Swanwick family plot on the western side of Highgate Cemetery five days later.  Her name appears on the south side of the Reformers Memorial in Kensal Green Cemetery in London.  References  Attribution  Sources  Mary L.

Among the earliest was Isaac Benjamin (also known as the ""Ninan Inspector"") who was followed by K.C. George in 1911. K.C. George laid the foundation of the Mar Thoma Church in Malaya by actively encouraging the movement of Syrian Christians from Kerala to Malaya, in spite of the dangers posed by malaria, rampant this country at that time.  Early Mar Thoma services generally took the form of prayer meetings in private homes. The first service following the Mar Thoma Service Order was held on the first Sundays of every month in the Jubilee School in Klang. This was followed in 1929 by regular services in the Penuel High School in Kuala Lumpur led by K. G. Mathew.  The first clergy arrives In 1928, the Very Rev. V.P. Mammen (later Vicar General V. P. Mammen Kasseessa), the General Secretary of the Sunday School Samajam, visited Malaya and upon his return to India strongly recommended to the Sabha Council that a Syrian Christian priest be sent there,to meet the desire of Marthomites to hold formal worship services in Malayalam. In 1932, Mar Thoma members in Klang, Kuala Lumpur, Banting and Kuala Selangor passed a resolution to request a priest from India, who would be resident in Malaya for a few years.  The call was answered when the Rev. T.N. Koshy arrived from India in August 1936. Rev. T.N. Koshy travelled the length and breadth of Malaya and Singapore to minister to the spiritual needs of the Syrian Christian community who were already here and those who were still coming to Malaya. This led to the setting up of one single parish covering the whole of Malaya and Singapore and laid the foundations of another era in the history of the Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church marking the establishment of the first Mar Thoma parish outside of India.  War and peace While there were those who doubted the viability of creating a parish out of this scattered community, they had not reckoned on the steady growth of the population. While most Syrian Christians still thought of Malaya as a temporary sojourn, there were signs of increasing commitment to this country; one of the most important was the purchase of a piece of land in Kuala Lumpur, on which to construct a church. What was significant was that this purchase was made right at the height of the Japanese Occupation.  With the conclusion of the war, a spurt in migrations of Syrian Christians was seen as further opportunities in the plantation, civil/administrative services and educational sectors opened up. The Rev. V.E. Thomas (later Senior Vicar for Malaysia-Singapore); who was here during the war years; received ordination in 1947 in India and returned to assist to meet the need of the increasing membership. In September/October 1953, the first three church buildings of the Mar Thoma community in Malaya; all named after St. Thomas; (in Kuala Lumpur, Klang and Singapore) were consecrated by the Rt. Rev. Dr. Mathews Mar Athanasius during the first ever Episcopal visit to the fledgling Mar Thoma Church in Malaya and Singapore.  In 1958, the Rev. T.N. Koshy was elevated as the Vicar-General for Malaya in recognition of the valuable services he rendered in encouraging and fostering the growth of the church in Malaya.  Elevation as diocese With the independence of Malaya in 1957, the number of parishes grew steadily and in 1962, the Diocese of Malaysia and Singapore was constituted comprising 27 parishes. Although the community suffered from emigration, especially after the May 13 Incident of 1969, activity continued apace indicating the further indigenisation of the Mar Thoma Church in Malaysia.  In 1982, the parishes in Malaysia and Singapore were constituted as the ""Malaysian Zone and the Singapore Zone of the Diocese of Malaysia and Singapore respectively (now the Diocese of Malaysia, Singapore and Australia).  Organisation and Symbols  The Zonal Assembly The church convenes a Zonal Assembly annually as the highest decision making body of the church and it consists of elected representatives of the various parishes and organisations. Zonal assembly members are elected for a 3-year period. The Zonal council consisting of all the vicars, the zonal secretary, the zonal treasurer and three council members function as the decision making and operational arm of the church.  Logo of the Mar Thoma Church The logo of the Mar Thoma Church consists of a shield emblazoned with a Christian cross with the representation of the Ashoka Chakra at its centre. It is flanked on the right and left by a lotus and a hand lamp respectively. The motto; Lighted To Lighten; is written in English above the cross.  The Motto The role of the church is to spread the good news of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Every believer and member of the Church here in their position, wherever they are, are given the light so that they can lighten others.  The Cross The cross placed in the centre represents the centrality of Jesus Christ in the church and its mission. It is a proclamation that God (Purusha) himself came and atoned for all mankind and the redemption is freely available by faith in Jesus Christ without regard to any form of karma.  The Ashoka Chakra The Ashoka Chakra is the symbol of India and represents the Indian roots of the church. Traditionally the Chakra as presented by the Emperor Ashoka, was a symbol in denoting the Wheel of Life and Cosmic Order (or Dharmachakra). By placing the wheel at the heart of the Cross, it is a declaration that life finds its ultimate salvation in the atoning sacrifice of Jesus once and for all. It symbolises the completion and closing of the wheel of life for all those who follow the Bhakthi Marga (path of righteousness) in Jesu Maseeh'' (Jesus Christ).  The Hand Lamp The hand lamp represents the lamp that is carried in all believers. It reminds all believers to be the light of the world and act as a witness to give the light of salvation for others in their daily life. It also seeks to remind to pay diligent attention to the study of the word of God.  The Lotus The lotus represents holy living and is traditionally part of the offering of sacrifices of praise and adoration in the Indian tradition to God. It reminds believers to live holy despite the circumstances around them and exude the fragrance of God.

History  Saint Thomas arrived at Malankara (present-day Kerala) from India on his way to preach Christianity in China during the reign of King Cola II of Calicut Kingdom around 52 AD.  He was accompanied by twelve disciples who were also sent out as missionaries along with him.   They founded several churches throughout southern India including one church near Vembanad Lake which became known as St Mary's Orthodox Church.    In 1545, Portuguese invaders destroyed this church but rebuilt it later under the name Igreja de Nossa Senhora da Conceicao or Our Lady of Conception Church.     It still stands today after undergoing many renovations over time.  In 1653, Saint Thomas' disciple Jacob Appuhamy established the first Mar Thoma parish in Changanassery, Thrissur district, Kerala state where he served as priest until his death in 1710.       During that period there were only two parishes in the whole country - Changanassery and Kottayam.      By the end of 18th century,  there are about twenty-five  parishes across Kerala.    During British rule,   the number of parishes increased rapidly due to immigration into the area from other parts of India such as Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.        Thereafter   the growth continued steadily till independence when the population boomed further because of migration from Indonesia, Burma/Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam etc., especially among those fleeing communist persecution.

Ted Thorn,"Edward Joseph ""Ted"" Thorn (born c. 1896) was an Australian rugby union player, a state and national representative flanker who made 36 appearances for the Waratahs. He played in fifteen Test matches and was captaining the national side on thirteen occasions (six Test matches) between 1924 and 1926.  Rugby career Thorn, a flanker, was born in Sydney and claimed a total of fifteen international rugby caps for Australia. His brother Joe, though Ted's junior by three years, represented the Waratahs first in 1921. Ted made his state representative debut in 1922, appearing three times for the New South Wales Waratahs against the visiting All Blacks for two victories. With no Queensland Rugby Union competition in place at that time, the New South Wales Waratahs were the top Australian representative rugby union side of the period and a number of Waratah matches of the 1920s played against full international opponents were in 1986 decreed by the Australian Rugby Union as Test matches – including fifteen such appearances made by Ted Thorn.  Thorn made the 1923 New South Wales tour of New Zealand playing in every one of the ten tour matches. Although the tour was not a success with only two matches being won, Thorn returned with his reputation intact. In 1924 when the All Blacks visited Australia, Thorn played in all three matches and in the final match he debuted as captain for the Waratahs, now in the record books as national captain. In the 1925 season he again captained New South Wales in two Tests against New Zealand, withdrawing with injury from the third match of the series. On the tour to New Zealand later that year he was selected as tour captain and played in the first seven matches before a wrist injury saw him stand down from the Test, passing the captaincy to Tom Lawton.

Fortified position of Liège,"The fortified position of Liège ( [PFL]) was established after the First World War by Belgium to block the traditional invasion corridor through Belgium between Germany and France. In the First World War the Belgian Army held up the Germans for a week at Liège, delaying the German invasion of France, caused Belgium to consider a similar defensive strategy. Belgium rebuilt the Liège fortifications and extended them onto the Pays de Herve (Herve plateau) closer to Germany, using the most advanced fortification technology available.  The PFL was divided into the modern defensive line, anchored on the Albert Canal by Fort Eben-Emael and extending to the south through a planned five additional forts, designated PFL I and the ring of forts around Liège. Liège commanded crucial road and rail crossings of the Meuse and was as strategically important in the 1930s as in 1914. The modernized Liège forts were called PFL II.  In 1936, Belgium's neutrality was proclaimed again by King Leopold III of Belgium in a vain attempt to forestall another invasion, preventing France from being able to make use of the Belgian defences and territory in the forward defence of France. At the outbreak of the Second World War, Belgian defences had to resist alone until France could advance into Belgium after its neutrality had been violated. Again the fortifications could not hold the Germans.  Background  When Belgium gained its independence from the Netherlands in 1830, it inherited four lines of Napoleonic forts called the Wellington Barrier that the state could not and did not want to maintain. The forts faced France, a nation that Belgium had fought for its independence alongside. The dismantling of the Wellington Barrier forts began in 1839, but after the Revolutions of 1848 and the establishment of the Second French Empire in 1851, Belgium faced the possibility of invasion by France. Belgian leaders sought a new defensive strategy and struggled with popular anti-military sentiment or opposing commercial interests regarding existing forts, but settled by 1859 on a plan championed by Belgian general . Beginning in 1847, Chazal called for Antwerp to be fortified and expanded into the National Redoubt as a fallback stronghold for the Belgian Army. The task of constructing the National Redoubt was given to a protégé of Chazal, Captain Henri Alexis Brialmont. Brialmont completed the National Redoubt in 1868, but technological advancements in artillery and another change in the geopolitical landscape of Europe again rendered Belgium's defensive strategy inadequate.  The Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71 had enormous geopolitical consequences for Belgium. A now-united Germany in the German Empire had annexed Alsace-Lorraine from France and thus ensured another war between the two nations. The new path for French or German soldiers into each other's nations was through the lightly defended Meuse river valley – through lightly defended southern Belgium and the unfortified French border. According to Chazal's doctrine, the forts of the Meuse were to be the fulcrum and crossing points for the army at Antwerp. At that moment, those fortresses numbered two: the citadels of Liège and Namur, which together controlled 18 out of 26 crossing over the Meuse. Within Liège alone were seventeen roads with twelve bridges over the Meuse and three train stations linking seven rail lines. The heights near the city commanded not only the nearby Herve and Hesbaye plains, but a  gap between Liège and the Dutch border. For over a decade following the Franco-Prussian War, several Belgian Ministers of War and even Otto von Bismarck urged the fortification of the Meuse. In 1882, Prime Minister Walthère Frère-Orban finally commissioned draft plans for fortresses to be built at Liège and Namur, and the strategically important crossings at Visé and Huy.  Brialmont was tasked with those drafts, but again political debate slowed the militarization of the Meuse until 31 December 1886, when Brialmont was invited to conduct another study. He finished and presented his report on 15 January 1887, calling for a system of military installations around Liège and Namur similar to the one he built around Antwerp. His plans were approved on 1 February 1887, but political squabbling delayed the passing of a budget for Brialmont to June 1887.  Design and construction  By the 1870s, technological advances in artillery such as rifling, melinite, and delayed fuzes, had given it greater range, accuracy, and destructive power. Bastion forts – the tradition in European military architecture for a century – had become obsolete. In response to artillery's increased reach, military architects began in the 1850s to build detached polygonal forts farther away from cities to protect them from bombardment. To counter its new destructive power, architects began making those forts more durable.  In 1887, French military engineer Henri-Louis-Philippe Mougin produced plans for a ""fort of the future"" (Fort de l'Avenir) that would be mostly underground, be built of concrete, and be armed with artillery in retractable steel gun turrets. Concrete, invented early in the 19th century, was found to be much more resistant to new artillery shells and following its use in the upgrading of the Séré de Rivières system in 1887 it became the standard building material for fortresses. The success of ironclad warships in the Crimean War inspired the other innovations of Mougin's design: gun turrets and metal armour. The initial strides in this field were made by Germans Hermann Gruson and , but Frenchmen like Mougin himself perfected fort gun turrets and made them retractable using counterweights. The Swiss built a prototype of Mougin's fort , as did the French , near Verdun. Mougin's plan was never adopted by the French military, but Brialmont was likely familiar with it.  At Liège, 12 forts – six small and six large – were to be placed in a ring  from the city. The circumference of the city's fortress ring was about , with a gap of around  between some of the forts, held by intermediate works. The ring forts were placed away from ravines or depressions that could conceal attackers. There was also to be a fort at Visé to guard its ford over the Meuse, and at Huy, half-way between Liège and Namur. Construction of the Meuse forts was first estimated to cost 24 million francs, and this was the sum given to Brialmont on 1 June 1887 even before his geological surveys were complete. To his consternation, no funds were allotted for Visé or Huy, and Brialmont had to economize his plans for the forts he could build. His forts had two traces, a triangular or a trapezoidal shape, depending on the terrain, and their structures were similarly regimented. There were three plans for the gorges and two for the central bunker, its casemates, and connecting galleries. The Meuse fortresses would be the first to be built entirely of concrete. The 'base' of a fort faced Liège, as did its entry ramp. During the battle of Liège, the fortress ring was bolstered with the addition of 31 redoubts and 63 trenches, behind and in front of the forts and surrounded by barbed wire.  The Belgian government awarded the contract to build the forts on 1 July 1888 to the French firm Hallier, Letellier Brothers, and Jules Barratoux. Construction began on 28 July 1888 with the clearing and excavation of the sites and building of storage and work structures. Work was finished three years later, on 29 October 1891, and cost ₣71,600,000. Around Liège, workers excavated  of earth, poured  of concrete, and laid  of brick.  Protection  Brialmont designed the Meuse forts to withstand the power of the heaviest artillery of his day:  pieces whose shells put out  of force. As a response to the 1886 melinite tests, he covered the masonry in the walls with a thick layer of concrete which itself was then covered with  of soil. The mixtures of concrete used, of which there were two, were determined by testing at the . Concrete was poured into wooden frames and left in place for over two weeks. Once dry, mortar would be brushed over the concrete until smoothed on the interior, and covered in soil on the exterior. The vulnerability of a structure determined the thickness of the concrete protecting it; the gorge wall of a barrack was  thick, while the exposed top of the massif was  thick. Protection against infantry was offered by a sea of barbed wire on the glacis around the ditch and the casemates of the gorge, housing 5.7 cm cannons and garrison infantry. These troops were also to be mustered in the massif for a sortie in case of a hostile infantry assault.  The German siege artillery that engaged the Meuse forts in World War I generated an excess of  of force. Compounding the deficit between modern artillery and the Meuse forts was that concrete could not be poured at night because of a lack of illumination equipment. Left to dry overnight, concrete poured the day before would not fully bond with the concrete of the next day. The consequences of this were severe. The explosion that annihilated the Fort de Loncin in August 1914 dislocated many different layers of concrete, resulting in immense damage to the entire fort. The relative thinness of the gorge front concrete would allow the Belgian Army to, in the event of a fort's capture, shell it from the city—from behind. The concrete and armour around the windows would be thus eroded until shells were exploding inside the barracks, forcing the garrison deeper within. The Imperial German Army, by entering Liège and Namur while attacking their forts, were able to do exactly this and to devastating effect.  Armament  The Meuse forts were armed with a total of 171 gun turrets, whose manufacture, transportation, and installation cost ₣24,210,775 in total. They were made of steel and placed in a concrete well in the massif or main redoubt. A turret itself sat on top a set of rollers, allowing it to turn 360°, and moved up and down its well with tracks running the length of the well. While smaller turrets could completely retract into the fortress, larger-calibre guns could not because of the length of their barrels. A steel collar protected the lip of the turret well and to prevent the displacement of the turret in case the nearby concrete was damaged. In October 1912, however, a cycle of artillery tests held in Russia and attended by Belgian officials showed that collar to be ineffective. 15 cm shells could jam a turret in place, while 28 cm shells could entirely dislodge them.  The turret and the guns within were moved, aimed, and fired from within the turret. This was done either by an observer within the turret directly, or indirectly with the use of a graduated ring that showed 1/20ths of a degree. According to Brialmont's specifications, a gun turret should make a complete rotation in 1.5 minutes, and three rotations in five minutes. Once the right angle and elevation was found, a brake was engaged to hold the turret in place. Ordinance was hoisted in a basket with a manual elevator to the gun, which was fitted with a hydraulic recoil brake containing a solution that was 80% glycerine and 20% water. The turret was kept under negative pressure using a manual ventilator to expel fumes from the gun and to keep fumes from incoming shells out of the fort. In case of a malfunction, a gun could be removed and replaced within a few hours. Munitions were held beneath the turrets in separate form, and without cartridge casings for larger-calibre guns and in a complete shell for 5.7 cm guns. Every one of the Meuse forts' guns used black powder and were never modified to use a smokeless alternative.  The smallest artillery employed in the Meuse forts was the  Nordenfelt cannon, used against attacking infantry at close range. These were usually mounted on a wheeled triangular carriage but sometimes also in turret form. In large forts, there were nine 5.7 cm guns in casemates – two in each gorge casemate, four in the head casemate, and one in the casemate guarding the entry ramp. In small forts, there were also nine 5.7 cm guns. Four were placed in gorge ditch casemates near the entrance, while another defended the ramp. Every trapezoidal fort had two of their nine 5.7 cm guns in the casemaste defending the fourth angle of the fort. Large forts had four 5.7 cm turrets, while small forts had three. These all contained a single gun, crewed by six men, and exclusively fired grapeshot. The casemate guns were produced by Cockerill and Krupp, while the turret versions were manufactured by Gruson.  The rest of a fort's armament was contained in turrets and its makeup depended on its size. Large forts received a single two-gun 15 cm turret, two two-gun 12 cm turrets, and two one-gun 21 cm turrets. Small forts had two one-gun 12 cm turrets and a one-gun 21 cm turret. These were produced by Gruson, Creusot, Saint-Chamond, , and Chatillon-Commentry. Additional guns were supplied by Marcinelle-Couillet, but only at the Fort de Boncelles and the large forts at Namur, and by Vanderkerhove, but only for Liège's large forts. All of the forts possessed a 60 cm searchlight in a turret produced by Ateliers de la Meuse.  Garrison and utilities The Meuse forts were garrisoned by a mix of infantry, artillerymen, engineers, and support staff. During peacetime, they lived in temporary wooden barracks. During hostilities, the garrison dismantled those barracks and moved into the gorge caserne, eight to twelve men to a room. Power was supplied by a steam engine apparatus in the lower levels of a fort's massif, although petrol lamps lit most of a fort. About  of coal and  of petroleum were stored within a fort. The primary means of communication between the forts were above-ground telegraph or telephone fires operated by civilians. Latrines were poorly planned and ventilation nonexistent, except at the Fort de Loncin. The drainage system was also poorly designed. Water was pulled from underground wells or collected during and after rains in a cistern to be used by the fort. During the battle of Liège, shell fire created debris that blocked the water pipes to the engine room, or flooded the munitions rooms and living areas.  World War I  War came in 1914, and Liège became the early focus of German attack on the way to France. The forts were known to have shortcomings in their ability to resist heavy artillery, and had never been modernised. During the battle of Liège the forts were pounded by heavy German artillery of 21 cm, 28 cm and 42 cm. The forts had never been designed to resist such heavy artillery. The bombardment exposed the forts' shortcomings in living arrangements, sanitation, ventilation, construction and protection, culminating with the explosion of the Fort de Loncin under bombardment. Even before this the forts had begun to surrender one by one as they became uninhabitable and unable to respond to attack. German forces defeated the troops assigned to defend the intervals between forts, penetrating to Liège and taking it before the first fort had surrendered.  The forts' mission was to delay the progress of an enemy for the time required for the Belgian Army to mobilise. Left to themselves, the forts were planned to resist a siege for about a month, based on estimates made in 1888. In 1914 the forts were completely outclassed by the much more powerful German artillery, which included the enormous Big Bertha 42 cm howitzer. It was therefore a surprise that the forts resisted as long and as successfully as they did. However, the forts' poor ability to deal with powder gases, pulverized dust and the stench from inadequate sanitary facilities became a determining factor in the endurance of the forts' garrisons. None of the forts, apart from the Fort de Loncin, possessed forced ventilation.  The Belgian forts made little provision for the daily needs of their wartime garrisons, locating latrines, showers, kitchens and the morgue in the fort's counterscarp, a location that would be untenable in combat. This had profound effects on the forts' ability to endure a long assault. These service areas were placed directly opposite the barracks, which opened into the ditch in the rear of the fort (i.e. in the face towards Liège), with lesser protection than  the two ""salient"" sides. This arrangement was calculated to place a weaker side to the rear to allow for recapture by Belgian forces from the rear, and in an age where mechanical ventilation was in its infancy, allowed natural ventilation of living quarters and support areas. However, the concept proved disastrous in practice. Heavy shellfire made the rear ditch untenable, and German forces were able to get between the forts and attack them from the rear. The massive German bombardments drove men into the central massif, where there were insufficient sanitary facilities for 500 men, rendering the air unbreathable, while the German artillery destroyed the forts from above and from the rear.  Battle of Liège   The Liège fortifications fulfilled their role, stopping the German Army long enough to allow the Belgian and French Armies to mobilize. The battle revealed shortcomings in the performance of the forts and in the Belgian strategy. The forts themselves suffered from inherent weakness of construction through poor understanding of concrete technology, as well as overall inadequate protection for the garrison and ammunition stores from heavy-caliber artillery bombardment. Unbreathable air from bombardment, the fort's own gun gases and from human waste compelled the surrender of most of the positions.  Position Fortifiée de Liège (PFL)  The Fortified Position of Liège was conceived by a commission charged with recommending options for the rebuilding of Belgium's defences. The 1927 report recommended the construction of a line of new fortifications to the east of the Meuse. Work was seriously delayed by budget crises, forcing work on all fortifications but Eben-Emael to be delayed. Work finally began on the forts at Battice, Aubin-Neufchâteau and Tancrémont in 1933. Two other planned positions were never pursued, with Aubin-Neufchâteau taking over the role of forts planned at Mauhin and Les Waides. There were five layers to the system:  Positions avancées: 66 small bunkers positioned close to the border as a delaying position.  PFL I: Four modern forts supported by 178 bunkers.  PFL II: The southern and eastern portions of the Brialmont fortress ring around Liège, modernized and provided with interval bunkers and anti-tank obstacles. There were 62 infantry shelters and 6 forts in this section.  PFL III: Small fortifications defending three crossings of the Meuse, comprising 42 bunkers on the eastern side of the river.  PFL IV: Three layers of defences on the west side of the Meuse, comprising a line on the Meuse with 31 bunkers, a line on the Albert Canal with nine bunkers, and ten bunkers with the Forts de Pontisse and Flémalle.  PFL II The Belgians initially rebuilt eight forts of the ring to the south and east of Liège, with later work on the west side of the fortress ring. It was not possible to repair the Fort de Loncin, which had been completely destroyed. The improvements addressed the shortcomings revealed by the battle of Liège, allowing the fortress ring to be a backstop to the primary line of fortifications farther east.  The Liège ring was designated PFL II, although the forts on the west side of the river were part of PFL IV.  Improvements included replacing 21 cm howitzers with longer-range 15 cm guns, 150mm howitzers with 120mm guns, and adding machine guns. Generating plants, ventilation, sanitation and troop accommodations were improved, as well as communications.  The work incorporated alterations that had already been made by the Germans during their occupation of the forts in World War I. Most notably, the upgraded forts received defended air intake towers, intended to look like water towers, that could function as observation posts and emergency exits.  PFL I Four new forts were built about  to the east of Liège, of a planned six. In contrast to the ring of forts protecting Liège, the new fortification line was similar in concept to the French Maginot Line: a series of positions in a line along the frontier, intended to prevent an enemy advance into Belgian territory, rather than to defend a specific strong point. This new line was designated PFL I, the primary defence line against an advance from Germany, as well as a German advance through Dutch territory at Maastricht. Fort Eben-Emael was positioned to defend the water obstacle of the Albert Canal and to anchor the northern end of the line, with a field of fire all the way north to Maastricht. The Fort de Battice occupied the second strategic point on the main road and rail lines from Aachen. The forts de Tancrémont and Aubin-Neufchâteau filled in the intervals. The cancelled Fort de Sougné-Remouchamps was to be similar to the smaller forts, while plans for two small forts at Comblain-du-Pont and Les Waides were abandoned early in the planning process. The big forts had as many as 2000 men, the smaller 600.  While the organization  of the overall defensive line mimicked the Maginot Line, the design of the individual forts was conservative.  In contrast to the French fortifications, distributed along a single main gallery in the fort palmé concept, the Belgian forts remained a set of powerfully-armed, tightly grouped combat blocks surrounded by a defended ditch. Eben-Emael and Battice featured 120mm gun turrets with a range of , and all four forts were equipped with 75mm gun turrets () and French 81mm mortars in pit emplacements.  Eben-Emael, with its site along the artificial cliff of the Albert Canal cutting, was the only fort to be equipped with artillery casemates.  The sheer face also provided a naturally-defended location for the fort's air intakes. The new forts featured extreme levels of concrete and armour protection, with between  and  of concrete cover and up to  of armour on turrets. Learning from World War I, the intervals between forts were liberally supplied with observation positions and infantry shelters.  Second World War battles  The Belgian command was counting on Eben-Emael to be the key defense of the northern frontier at Liège. It naturally attracted the first German attacks. Its enormous dimensions dictated an unconventional attack strategy, using airborne troops. The fort was attacked on 10 May 1940 and rendered ineffective in a few hours by a team of 75 men armed with new shaped-charge explosives. Ineffective Belgian defense of the fort's surface allowed the German assault team to use their explosive charges to destroy or render the fort's gun turrets and machine gun cloches uninhabitable.  With Eben-Emael out of action, the Germans could attack the other new forts with more conventional means, continuing attacks from 10 May. The forts of both PFL I and II attempted to support each other with covering fire, but to little effect. The PFL I forts quickly fell, with Battice and Aubin-Neufchâteau surrendering on 22 May. Tancrémont was bypassed.  The PFL II forts were assaulted starting 12 May after Belgian field forces retreated from Liège. Isolated, the forts fought on. Fort de Flémalle came under air attack on 15 May, surrendering the next day. On 18 May Fort de Barchon was assaulted by the same infantry battalion that had attacked Eben-Emael, supported by a 420mm howitzer. The fort surrendered the same day, as did Fléron and Pontisse. Evengnée surrendered on 20 May. The other forts to the south were bypassed and surrendered on 28 May, part of the general Belgian surrender.  Tancrémont held out until the next day, the last fort to surrender.  During the Second World War Eben-Emael was abandoned, apart from use for propaganda films and weapons effects experiments, including armor-piercing shells. Battice and Aubin-Neufchâteau were also used for these experiments.  Present day   Of the dozen Brialmont forts, seven are open to the public and may be visited – Loncin, Lantin,  Flémalle, Hollogne, Pontisse, Barchon and Embourg. Chaudfontaine may also be visited under certain circumstances, but has not been rehabilitated. The Fort de Loncin has since the explosion of 15 August 1914, been a military cemetery and memorial. The Fort de Lantin has been extensively restored, and since it was not re-armed between the wars, it presents the appearance of an 1888 fort.  Other forts have been partially buried (Fléron, Boncelles) and are not visitable, apart from the air intake tower of Boncelles. Others are supply depots for the Belgian Army.  The four inter-war forts are in varying states of preservation, though all may be visited. Tancrémont is notably intact, with all equipment present. Eben-Emael and the others remain military property, but Eben-Emael is administered by the Association Fort Eben-Emael as a museum.

Ferdinand Johann Adam von Pernau,"Ferdinand Johann Adam von Pernau, Count of Rosenau (7 November 1660, Steinach am Brenner, Austria – 14 October 1731, Schloss Rosenau, Coburg) was an Austrian ornithologist.  Ferdinand Pernau entered the University of Altdorf (near Nuremberg) at age 16. He traveled for some time in Italy, France and the Netherlands, finally settling in Rosenau, near Coburg where he remained until his death. Fascinated by birds he built large aviaries where numerous species bred. Here he made observations of bird behavior and also he devised ways to tame birds and studied homing behaviour.  In 1702 he anonymously published a narrative of his experiments and observations. The work entitled Unterricht was mit dem lieblichen Geschöpff, denen Vögeln, auch ausser dem Fang Nur durch die Ergründung Deren Eigenschafften und Zahmmachung oder ander Abrichtung Man sich vo Lust und Zeitvertreib machen könne : gestellt Durch den Hoch- und Wohlgebohrnen was popular and quickly reprinted in 1707 and 1716 (as Angenehmer Ziet-Vertreib, welchen das liebliche Geschöpf Die Vögel, Auch ausser dem Fang in Ergründung deren Eigenschaften Zahmmachung oder anderer Abrichtung dem Menschen schaffen können ; Mit vielen Anmerckungen versehen und mit schönen Kupffern gezieret Durch einen Die erschaffenen Creaturen beschauenden Liebhaber)  In 1720 he published an essay (Angenehme Land-Lust Deren man in Städten und auf dem Lande, ohne, sonderbare Kosten, unschuldig geniessen kan, oder von Unterschied Fang Einstellung und Abrichtung der Vögel) in which he said, for the first time that the singing of birds is not necessarily instinctive but is the result of learning. He was also the first to recognize the migration trigger factor was not hunger or cold, but some hidden mechanism. His work anticipated further developments of ornithology including that of Konrad Lorenz. He was also one of the first to show his disgust at the killing of birds : I have no intention of describing how to catch birds [...] but to describe the pleasure of watching these beautiful creatures of God without killing them.

Mohicans,"The Mohican ( or , alternate spelling: Mahican) are an Eastern Algonquian Native American tribe that historically spoke an Algonquian language. As part of the Eastern Algonquian family of tribes, they are related to the neighboring Lenape, who occupied territory to the south as far as the Atlantic coast. The Mohican occupied the upper tidal Hudson River Valley, including the confluence of the Mohawk River (where present-day Albany, New York, developed) and into western New England centered on the upper Housatonic River watershed. After 1680, due to conflicts with the powerful Mohawk to the west during the Beaver Wars, many were driven southeastward across the present-day Massachusetts western border and the Taconic Mountains to Berkshire County around Stockbridge, Massachusetts.   They combined with Lenape Native Americans (a branch known as the Munsee) in Stockbridge, and later the people moved west away from pressure of European settlement. They settled in what became Shawano County, Wisconsin. Most eastern American Indian populations were forced to reservations in Indian Territory during the 1830s, and other reservations in the American West later. Decades later they eventually formed the federally recognized Stockbridge-Munsee Community with registered members of the Munsee people and have a  reservation.  Following the disruption of the American Revolutionary War, most of the Mohican descendants first migrated westward to join the Iroquois Oneida on their reservation in central New York. The Oneida gave them about 22,000 acres for their use. After more than two decades, in the 1820s and 1830s, the Oneida and the Stockbridge moved again, pressured to sell their lands and relocate to northeastern Wisconsin under the federal Indian Removal program. A group of Mohican also migrated to Ontario, Canada to live with the predominately Iroquois Six Nations of the Grand River reserve.  The tribe identified by the place where they lived:  (or ""people of the continually flowing waters""). The word  refers to a great sea or body of water, and the Hudson River reminded them of their place of origin, so they named the Hudson River , or the river where there are people from the continually flowing waters. Therefore, they, along with other tribes living along the Hudson River (such as the Munsee to their west, known by the dialect of Lenape that they spoke, and Wappinger) to the south, were called ""the River Indians"" by the Dutch and English.   The Dutch heard and transliterated the term for the people of the area in their own language, variously as: Mahigan, Mahikander, Mahinganak, Maikan and Mawhickon, among other variants, which the English later expressed as Mohican or Mahican, in a transliteration to their own spelling system. The French, adopting names used by their Indian allies in Canada, knew the Mohican as the  (or wolves). They referred to the Iroquois Confederacy as the ""Snake People"", as they were called by some competitors, or ""Five Nations"", representing their original tribes).  Like the Munsee and Wappinger peoples, the Mohican were Algonquian-speaking, part of a large language family related also to the Lenape people, who occupied coastal areas from western Long Island to the Delaware River valley to the south.  In the late twentieth century, the Mohican joined other former New York tribes, including the Oneida and some other Iroquois nations, in filing land claims against New York for what were considered unconstitutional purchases of their lands after the Revolutionary War. Only the federal government had constitutional authority to deal with the Indian nations. In 2010, outgoing governor David Paterson announced a land exchange with the Stockbridge-Munsee that would enable them to build a large casino on  in Sullivan County in the Catskills, as a settlement in exchange for dropping their larger claim in Madison County. The deal had many opponents.  Territory In their own language, the Mohican identified collectively as the , ""people of the great tidal river"".  At the time of their first contact with Europeans traders along the river in the 1590s, the Mohican were living in and around the Hudson River (or ). After 1609, at the time of the Dutch settlement of New Netherland, they also ranged along the eastern Mohawk River and the Hoosic River, and south along the Hudson to the Roeliff Jansen Kill, where they bordered on the Wappinger people. This nation inhabited the river area and its interior southward to today's New York City.  Most of the Mohican communities lay along the upper tidal reaches of the Hudson River and along the watersheds of Kinderhook-Claverack-Taghkanic Creek, the Roeliff Jansen Kill, Catskil Creek, and adjacent areas of the Housatonic watershed. Mohican territory reached along Hudson River watersheds northeastward to Wood Creek just south of Lake Champlain.  Culture The Mohican villages were governed by hereditary sachems advised by a council of clan elders. They had a matrilineal kinship system, with property and inheritance (including such hereditary offices) passed through the maternal line. Moravian missionary John Heckewelder and early anthropologist Lewis H. Morgan both learned from Mohican informants that their matrilineal society was divided into three phratries (Turkey, Turtle, and Wolf). These were divided into clans or subclans, including a potentially prominent Bear Clan. This finding is supported by the evidence of Mohican signatures on treaties and land deeds (see the works of Shirley Dunn).  A general council of sachems met regularly at Scodac (east of present-day Albany) to decide important matters affecting the entire confederacy. In his history of the Indians of the Hudson River, Edward Manning Ruttenber described the clans of the Mohican as the Bear, the Turkey, the Turtle, and the Wolf. Each had a role in the lives of the people, and the Wolf served as warriors in the north to defend against the Mohawk, the easternmost of the Five Nations of the Iroquois.  Like the Munsee-speaking communities to their south, Mohican villages followed a dispersed settlement pattern, with each community likely dominated by a single lineage or clan. The villages usually consisted of a small cluster of small and mid-sized longhouses, and were located along floodplains. During times of war, they built fortifications in defensive locations (such as along ridges) as places of retreat. Their cornfields were located near their communities; the women also cultivated varieties of squash, beans, sunflowers, and other crops from the Eastern Agricultural Complex. Horticulture and the gathering and processing of nuts (hickory, butternuts, black walnuts and acorns), fruits (blueberries, raspberries, juneberries among many others), and roots (groundnuts, wood lilies, arrowroot among others) provided much of their diet. This was supplemented by the men hunting game (turkeys, deer, elk, bears, and moose in the Taconics) and fishing (sturgeon, alewives, shad, eels, lamprey and striped bass).  Language The now extinct Mohican language belonged to the Eastern Algonquian branch of the Algonquian language family.  History  Mohican Confederacy The Mohican were a confederacy of five tribes and as many as forty villages.  Mohican proper, lived in the vicinity of today's Albany (, ""the fireplace of the Mahican Nation"") west towards the Mohawk River and to the northwest to Lake Champlain and Lake George  , lived along the west shore of the Hudson River above the Catskill Creek Wawyachtonoc (or ,  ""eddy people"" or ""people of the curving channel""), lived in Dutchess County and Columbia County eastward to the Housatonic River in Litchfield County, Connecticut, main village was Weantinock, additional villages: Shecomeco, Wechquadnach, Pamperaug, Bantam, Weataug, Scaticook  Westenhuck (from , ""on the other side of the mountains""), the name of a village near Great Barrington, Massachusetts. Often called the ""Housatonic people"", they lived in the Housatonic Valley in Connecticut and Massachusetts and in the vicinity of Great Barrington, which they called , meaning ""the place downstream""  Wiekagjoc (from , ""upper reaches of a river""), lived east of the Hudson Rivers near the city of Hudson, Columbia County, New York  Conflict with the Mohawk   The Algonquians (Mohican) and Iroquois (Mohawk) were traditional competitors and enemies. Iroquois oral tradition, as recorded in the Jesuit Relations, speaks of a war between the Mohawks and an alliance of the Susquehannock and Algonquin (sometime between 1580 and 1600). This was perhaps in response to the formation of the League of the Iroquois.  In September 1609 Henry Hudson encountered Mohican villages just below present day Albany, with whom he traded goods for furs. Hudson returned to Holland with a cargo of valuable furs which immediately attracted Dutch merchants to the area. The first Dutch fur traders arrived on the Hudson River the following year to trade with the Mohicans. Besides exposing them to European epidemics, the fur trade destabilized the region.  In 1614, the Dutch decided to establish a permanent trading post on Castle Island, on the site of a previous French post that had been long abandoned; but first they had to arrange a truce to end fighting which had broken out between the Mohicans and Mohawks. Fighting broke out again between the Mohicans and Mohawks in 1617, and with Fort Nassau badly damaged by a freshet, the Dutch abandoned the fort. In 1618, having once again negotiated a truce, the Dutch rebuilt Fort Nassau on higher ground. Late that year, Fort Nassau was destroyed by flooding and abandoned for good. In 1624, Captain Cornelius Jacobsen May sailed the  upriver and landed eighteen families of Walloons on a plain opposite Castle Island. They commenced to construct Fort Orange.  The Mohicans invited the Algonquin and Montagnais to bring their furs to Fort Orange as an alternate to French traders in Quebec. Seeing the Mohicans extended their control over the fur trade, the Mohawk attacked, with initial success. In 1625 or 1626 the Mohicans destroyed the easternmost Iroquois ""castle"". The Mohawks then re-located south of the Mohawk River, closer to Fort Orange. In July 1626 many of the settlers moved to New Amsterdam because of the conflict. The Mohicans requested help from the Dutch and Commander Daniel Van Krieckebeek set out from the fort with six soldiers. Van Krieckebeek, three soldiers, and twenty-four Mohicans were killed when their party was ambushed by the Mohawk about a mile from the fort. The Mohawks withdrew with some body parts of those slain for later consumption as a demonstration of supremacy.  War continued to rage between the Mohicans and Mohawks throughout the area from Skahnéhtati (Schenectady) to Kinderhoek Kinderhook. By 1629, the Mohawks had taken over territories on the west bank of the Hudson River that were formerly held by the Mohicans. The conflict caused most of the Mohican to migrate eastward across the Hudson River into western Massachusetts and Connecticut.  The Mohawks gained a near-monopoly in the fur trade with the Dutch by prohibiting the nearby Algonquian-speaking tribes to the north or east to trade.  Stockbridge Many Mohicans settled in the town of Stockbridge, Massachusetts, where they gradually became known as the ""Stockbridge Indians"". , one of their chiefs, accompanied three Mohawk chiefs on a state visit to Queen Anne and her government in England in 1710. They were popularly referred to as the Four Mohawk Kings.  The Stockbridge Indians allowed Protestant missionaries, including Jonathan Edwards, to live among them.  In the 18th century, many converted to Christianity, while keeping certain traditions of their own.  They fought on the side of the British colonists in the French and Indian War (also known as the Seven Years' War).  During the American Revolution, they sided with the colonists.  In the eighteenth century, some of the Mohicans developed strong ties with missionaries of the Moravian Church from Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, who founded a mission at their village of  in Dutchess County, New York. Henry Rauch reached out to two Mohican leaders, , also known as ; and , who took him back to Shekomeko. They named him the new religious teacher. Over time, Rauch won listeners, as the Mohicans had suffered much from disease and warfare, which had disrupted their society. Early in 1742, Shabash and two other Mohicans accompanied Rauch to Bethlehem, where he was to be ordained as a deacon. The three Mohicans were baptized on 11 February 1742 in John de Turk's barn nearby at Oley, Pennsylvania. Shabash was the first Mohican of Shekomeko to adopt the Christian religion. The Moravians built a chapel for the Mohican people in 1743. They defended the Mohican against European colonists' exploitation, trying to protect them against land encroachment and abuses of liquor.  On a 1738 visit to New York, the Mohicans spoke to Governor Lewis Morris concerning the sale of their land near Shekomeko. The Governor promised they would be paid as soon as the lands were surveyed.  He suggested that for their own security, they should mark off their square mile of land they wished to keep, which the Mohicans never did. In September 1743, still under the Acting-Governor George Clarke the land was finally surveyed by New York Assembly agents and divided into lots, a row of which ran through the Indians' reserved land. With some help from the missionaries, on 17 October 1743 and already under the new Royal Governor George Clinton, Shabash put together a petition of names of people who could attest that the land in which one of the lots was running through was theirs. Despite Shabash's appeals, his persistence, and the missionaries' help, the Mohicans lost the case. The lots were eventually bought up by European-American colonists and the Mohicans were forced out of Shekomeko. Some who opposed the missionaries' work accused them of being secret Catholic Jesuits (who had been outlawed from the colony in 1700) and of working with the Mohicans on the side of the French. The missionaries were summoned more than once before colonial government, but also had supporters. In the late 1740s the colonial government at Poughkeepsie expelled the missionaries from New York, in part because of their advocacy of Mohican rights. European colonists soon took over the Mohican land.  Revolutionary War  In August 1775, the Six Nations staged a council fire near Albany, after news of Bunker Hill had made war seem imminent. After much debate, they decided that such a war was a private affair between the British and the colonists (known as Rebels, Revolutionaries, Congress-Men, American Whigs, or Patriots), and that they should stay out of it. Mohawk Chief Joseph Brant feared that the Indians would lose their lands if the Colonists achieved independence. Sir William Johnson, his son John Johnson and son-in-law Guy Johnson and Brant used all their influence to engage the Iroquois to fight for the British cause. The Mohawk, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca ultimately became allies and provided warriors for the battles in the New York area. The Oneida and Tuscarora sided with the Colonists. The Mohicans, who as Algonquians were not part of the Iroquois Confederacy, sided with the Patriots, serving at the Siege of Boston, and the battles of Saratoga and Monmouth.  In 1778 they lost forty warriors of their Stockbridge Militia, around half ""Stockbridge Indians"" who were remnants of both Mohican and Wappinger tribes, in a British attack on the land of the van Cortlandt family. (In 1888, the property became Van Courtland Park in the Bronx, New York.) The Battle of Kingsbridge decimated the troop's ranks.  It received a commendation from George Washington, was paid $1,000 and dismissed.  Move to Oneida, New York After the Revolution the citizens of the new United States forced many Native Americans off their land and westward. In the 1780s, groups of Stockbridge Indians, today regarded as Stockbridge Munsee, moved from Massachusetts to a new location among the Oneida people in central New York, who had been granted a  reservation for their service to the Patriots, out of their former territory of . They called their settlement New Stockbridge. Some individuals and families, mostly people who were old or those with special ties to the area, remained behind at Stockbridge.  The central figures of Mohican society, including the chief sachem, Joseph Quanaukaunt, and his counselors and relatives, were part of the move to New Stockbridge. At the new town, the Stockbridge emigrants controlled their own affairs and combined traditional ways with the new as they chose. After learning from the Christian missionaries, the Stockbridge Indians were experienced in English ways. At New Stockbridge they replicated their former town. While continuing as Christians, they retained their language and Mohican cultural traditions. In general, their evolving Mohican identity was still rooted in traditions of the past.  Removal to Wisconsin In the 1820s and 1830s, most of the Stockbridge Indians moved to Shawano County, Wisconsin, where they were promised land by the US government under the policy of Indian removal. In Wisconsin, they settled on reservations with the Lenape (called Munsee after one of their major dialects), who were also speakers of one of the Algonquian languages.  Together, the two formed a band and are federally recognized as the Stockbridge-Munsee Community.  Their 22,000-acre reservation is known as that of the Stockbridge-Munsee Band of Mohican Indians and is located near the town of Bowler. Since the late twentieth century, they have developed the North Star Mohican Resort and Casino on their reservation, which has successfully generated funds for tribal welfare and economic development.  Land claims In the late twentieth century, the Stockbridge-Munsee were among tribes filing land claims against New York, which had been ruled to have unconstitutionally acquired land from Indians without Senate ratification. The Stockbridge-Munsee filed a land claim against New York state for  in Madison County, the location of its former property. In 2011, outgoing governor David Paterson announced having reached a deal with the tribe. They would be given nearly  in Madison County and give up their larger claim in exchange for the state's giving them 330 acres of land in Sullivan County in the Catskill Mountains, where the government was trying to encourage economic development. The federal government had agreed to take the land in trust, making it eligible for development as a gaming casino, and the state would allow gaming, an increasingly important source of revenue for American Indians. Race track and casinos, private interests and other tribes opposed the deal.  In 2011, the Stockbridge-Munsee Community Band of the Mohican Indians regained ownership 156 acres along the Hudson River, a tract known as Papscanee Island Nature Preserve near East Greenbush and Schodack. The land was donated to descendants of its indigenous inhabitants by the Open Space Initiative. Prior to colonization, the island was used for ceremonies by the Mohicans before it was acquired by Dutch merchant Kiliaen Van Rensselaer in 1637. The property is managed by Rensselaer County and the Rensselaer Land Trust for public access and protection, while owned by the Mohicans.  Representation in media James Fenimore Cooper based his novel, The Last of the Mohicans, on the Mohican tribe. His description includes some cultural aspects of the Mohegan, a different Algonquian tribe that lived in eastern Connecticut.

Social order,"The term social order can be used in two senses: In the first sense, it refers to a particular system of social structures and institutions. Examples are the ancient, the feudal, and the capitalist social order. In the second sense, social order is contrasted to social chaos or disorder and refers to a stable state of society in which the existing social structure is accepted and maintained by its members. The problem of order or Hobbesian problem, which is central to much of sociology, political science and political philosophy, is the question of how and why it is that social orders exist at all.  Sociology Thomas Hobbes is recognized as the first to clearly formulate the problem, to answer which he conceived the notion of a social contract. Social theorists (such as Karl Marx, Émile Durkheim, Talcott Parsons, and Jürgen Habermas) have proposed different explanations for what a social order consists of, and what its real basis is. For Marx, it is the relations of production or economic structure which is the basis of social order. For Durkheim, it is a set of shared social norms. For Parsons, it is a set of social institutions regulating the pattern of action-orientation, which again are based on a frame of cultural values. For Habermas, it is all of these, as well as communicative action.  Principle of extensiveness Another key factor concerning social order is the principle of extensiveness. This states the more norms and the more important the norms are to a society, the better these norms tie and hold together the group as a whole.  A good example of this is smaller religions based in the U.S., such as the Amish. Many Amish live together in communities and because they share the same religion and values, it is easier for them to succeed in upholding their religion and views because their way of life is the norm for their community.  Groups and networks In every society, people belong to groups, such as businesses, families, churches, athletic groups, or neighborhoods. The structure inside of these groups mirrors that of the whole society. There are networks and ties between groups, as well as inside of each of the groups, which create social order.  Some people belong to more than one group, and this can sometimes cause conflict. The individual may encounter a situation in which he or she has to choose one group over another. Many who have studied these groups believe that it is necessary to have ties between groups to strengthen the society as a whole, and to promote pride within each group. Others believe that it is best to have stronger ties to a group, enabling social norms and values to be reinforced.  Status groups ""Status groups"" can be based on a person's characteristics such as race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, caste, region, occupation, physical attractiveness, gender, education, age, etc. They are defined as ""a subculture having a rather specific rank (or status) within the stratification system. That is, societies tend to include a hierarchy of status groups, some enjoying high ranking and some low."" One example of this hierarchy is the prestige of a school teacher compared to that of a garbage man.  A certain lifestyle usually distinguishes the members of different status groups. For example, around the holidays a Jewish family may celebrate Hanukkah while a Christian family may celebrate Christmas. Other cultural differences such as language and cultural rituals identify members of different status groups.  Smaller groups exist inside of one status group. For instance, one can belong to a status group based on one's race and a social class based on financial ranking. This may cause strife for the individual in this situation when he or she feels they must choose to side with either their status group or their social class. For example, a wealthy African American man who feels he has to take a side on an issue on which the opinions of poor African Americans and wealthy white Americans are divided and finds his class and status group opposed.  Values and norms Values can be defined as ""internal criteria for evaluation"". Values are also split into two categories, there are individual values, which pertains to something that we think has worth and then there are social values. Social values are our desires modified according to ethical principles or according to the group, we associate with: friends, family, or co-workers. Norms tell us what people ought to do in a given situation. Unlike values, norms are enforced externally – or outside of oneself. A society as a whole determines norms, and they can be passed down from generation to generation.  Power and authority An exception to the idea of values and norms as social order-keepers is deviant behavior. Not everyone in a society abides by a set of personal values or the group's norms all the time. For this reason, it is generally deemed necessary for a society to have authority. The adverse opinion holds that the need for authority stems from social inequality.   In a class society, those who hold positions of power and authority are among the upper class. Norms differ for each class because the members of each class were raised differently and hold different sets of values. Tension can form, therefore, between the upper class and lower class when laws and rules are put in place that do not conform to the values of both classes.  Spontaneous order The order does not necessarily need to be controlled by the government.  Individuals pursuing self-interest can make predictable systems.  These systems, being planned by more than one person, may actually be preferable to those planned by a single person.  This means that predictability may be possible to achieve without a central government's control.  These stable expectations do not necessarily lead to individuals behaving in ways that are considered beneficial to group welfare.  Considering this, Thomas Schelling studied neighborhood racial segregation. His findings suggest that interaction can produce predictability, but it does not always increase social order.  In his researching, he found that ""when all individuals pursue their own preferences, the outcome is segregation rather than integration,"" as stated in ""Theories of Social Order"", edited by Michael Hechter and Christine Horne.  Social honor Social honor can also be referred to as social status. It is considered the distribution of prestige or ""the approval, respect, admiration, or deference a person or group is able to command by virtue of his or its imputed qualities or performances"". The case most often is that people associate social honor with the place a person occupies with material systems of wealth and power. Since most of the society finds wealth and power desirable, they respect or envy people that have more than they do. When social honor is referred to as social status, it deals with the rank of a person within the stratification system. Status can be achieved, which is when a person position is gained on the basis of merit or in other words by achievement and hard work or it can be ascribed, which is when a person position is assigned to individuals or groups without regard for merit but because of certain traits beyond their control, such as race, sex, or parental social standing. An example of ascribed status is Kate Middleton who married a prince. An example of achieved status is Oprah Winfrey, an African American woman from poverty who worked her way to being a billionaire.  Attainment Two different theories exist that explain and attempt to account for social order. The first theory is ""order results from a large number of independent decisions to transfer individual rights and liberties to a coercive state in return for its guarantee of security for persons and their property, as well as its establishment of mechanisms to resolve disputes,"" as stated in Theories of Social Order by Hechter and Horne. The next theory is that ""the ultimate source of social order as residing not in external controls but in a concordance of specific values and norms that individuals somehow have managed to internalize."" also stated in Theories of Social Order by Hechter and Horne. Both arguments for how social order is attained are very different. One argues that it is achieved through outside influence and control, and the other argues that it can only be attained when the individual willingly follows norms and values that they have grown accustomed to and internalized. Weber's insistence on the importance of domination and symbolic systems in social life was retained by Pierre Bourdieu, who developed the idea of social orders, ultimately transforming it into a theory of fields.

Ada Bittenbender,"Ada Matilda Cole Bittenbender (August 3, 1848 – December 15, 1925) was an American lawyer and feminist activist. She became the first woman admitted to practice before the Nebraska Supreme Court and the third woman admitted to practice before the U.S. Supreme Court.  Early life Ada Matilda Cole was born in Asylum Township, Pennsylvania on August 3, 1848. Her father was Daniel Cole, an inventor, and her mother was Emily A. Madison. She graduated from Lowell’s Commercial College in Binghamton, New York in 1869 and from the Pennsylvania State Normal School at Bloomsburg in 1875. After teaching for one year, she attended the Froebel Normal Institute in Washington, D.C. from 1876 to 1877. After graduation, she worked as principal of the Pennsylvania State Normal School for a year before resigning due to health reasons.  On August 9, 1878, she married lawyer Henry Clay Bittenbender, a Princeton College graduate. After marrying, the couple moved to Osceola, Nebraska. While studying law, she began editing the Record, the only paper in Polk county. She later edited Nebraska's first Farmers' Alliance paper, which was dedicated to temperance, morality, and Republican politics. The Bittenbenders also reorganized the Polk County Agricultural Association, where Ada Bittenbender served as secretary, treasurer, orator, and the 1881 representative at the annual meeting of the State Board of Agriculture, the first woman to fill this role.  When the Nebraska Woman Suffrage Association was organized in 1881, Bittenbender was elected recording secretary, and she worked with others to secure the submission of a woman's suffrage amendment to the state constitution in 1881. At the first suffrage convention following the submission, she was made one of the three woman campaign speakers, and at the next she was elected president.  Career In 1882, Bittenbender passed the Nebraska bar examination, and became the first woman admitted to the bar in Nebraska. Along with her husband, she became a partner in the law firm H.C. & Ada M. Bittenbender, which they established in Lincoln in December 1882.  Bittenbender was described as a very successful lawyer, and won every case she brought before the Nebraska Supreme Court. She was admitted to the United States District and Circuit courts of Nebraska. While practicing law, Bittenbender worked as a legislative advocate. She worked for passage of a scientific temperance instruction bill, a bill restricting tobacco sales to minors, and a law giving a mother equal guardian status as the father. She also helped establish a home for women and girls as well as an industrial school, both established by the Nebraska legislature.  In 1888, at the International Council of Women held in Washington, D.C., she addressed the council with a speech entitled ""Women in the Law."" She also represented the Woman's Christian Temperance Union in Washington, D.C., for many years, eventually becoming its national attorney and advocating for legislative reform on temperance and the advancement and protection of women. In that position, she drafted The National Prohibitory Amendment Guide, a document promoting a federal amendment on prohibition.  In 1888, Bittenbender was admitted to practice in the Supreme Court of the United States and was elected to the International Woman's Christian Temperance Union. In 1891, Bittenbender was nominated for Judge of the Supreme Court of Nebraska.  Bittenbender authored a chapter on ""Women in Law"" in Woman's Work in America in 1891. She also wrote a book titled Tedos and Tisod: A Temperance Story.  Later life In her later years, Bittenbender retired from law and devoted herself to philosophical studies. She died at her sister's home in Lincoln on December 15, 1925.

"Coonalpyn, South Australia","Coonalpyn  is a town and a locality in the Australian state of South Australia located about  south-east of the state capital of Adelaide and about  south-east of the municipal seat in Tailem Bend.  It is situated in  the local government area of the Coorong District Council and is in the State electoratal district of MacKillop and the Federal division of Barker.  At the 2016 census, the locality had a population of 353 of which 195  lived in its town centre.  Origin of the name  This town's name is derived from the Aboriginal word Coonalpyn, meaning Barren Woman. Coonalpyn Downs was chosen by John Barton Hack to name the property and the railway station within this property.  History  The town of Coonalpyn was proclaimed on 25 November 1909.  In 1927, the Congregational Church in Coonalpyn erected its church building, and is now the Coonalpyn Uniting Church.  Coonalpyn was originally known as part of the Ninety Mile Desert, until in approximately 1949 when the land was developed by the AMP Society.  The town became the seat for the District Council of Coonalpyn Downs  which was established on 30 May 1957.  Electricity came to Coonalpyn through ETSA in 1962 and the Tailem Bend–Keith pipeline was constructed in 1968.  In 1997, the District Council of Coonalpyn Downs  amalgamated with the Peake District Council and Meningie District Council to form The Coorong District Council.  Boundaries for the locality of Coonalpyn were created on 24 August 2000.  Lutheran History of the Area A group of Lutheran Settlers moved to the Coonalpyn District in the early 1920s, the first congregation, Bethlehem Lutheran Congregation, being formed on 9 March 1930.  A second congregation, Immanuel Lutheran Congregation, was formed on 28 July 1940.  In 1952, the two congregations conjointly decided to erect a church and move out of the old town institute into the new Coonalpyn Lutheran Church.  The church was finished and dedicated in 1953.  When Lutheran Amalgamation occurred in 1966, the United Evangelical Lutheran Church in Australia (UELCA) & Evangelical Lutheran Church of Australia  (ELCA) congregations merged to form the Redeemer Lutheran Congregation, and a new parish was formed which included congregations at Tintinara and Meningie.  Sporting Teams  In 1992, the Border-Downs Magpies and Tintinara Blues amalgamated to form the Border-Downs Tintinara Crows Football Club.  The club was then a member of the River Murray Football League, and in 2001 joined the Mallee Football League. This also includes the Crows Netball Club.  Coonalpyn also has a tennis club which belongs to the Border-Downs Tennis Association including towns such as Malinong, Culburra, Yumali, Coomandook, Tintinara & Ki Ki  There is also an active lawn bowls club which has a series of ""community bowls"" nights during the summer months to encourage the community to come and try lawn bowls.

Mortal Kombat (comics),"The Mortal Kombat comic books series included the official Mortal Kombat comics by Midway and a licensed adaptation series by Malibu Comics that was published in 1994-1995. There are thus two different lineups of Mortal Kombat comics: the tie-ins published by Midway (some of them made by Mortal Kombat co-creator John Tobias) and DC Comics that closely followed the storyline of the games, and the Malibu series, which took a few liberties with the source material.  Comics published by Midway Games The Midway comics were tie-ins published to coincide with the launches of Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat II, and Mortal Kombat 4. They offered insight into the backstory to each of the games as well as providing exposition of events occurring before each game.  Mortal Kombat Collector's Edition  Mortal Kombat Collector's Edition Midway's comic book prologue to the original Mortal Kombat was only released by mail order when the original arcade version was released in 1992. The mail order deal was displayed during the attract mode of the game. (This mode of advertising was also used in Mortal Kombat II.) The comic book would later be sold normally around the country, although it was close to impossible to get a copy outside of the United States. The comic was written and illustrated by John Tobias, the early Mortal Kombat series' designer artist. The final few pages offer character profiles for the seven playable characters in the original MK and the boss, Goro.  The comic begins by filling in the backstory of Shang Tsung, the Great Kung Lao, and Goro, whose victory in Mortal Kombat had meant a new dark era for the tournament. In the present day, where Liu Kang receives permission from Master Wu to fight in Mortal Kombat. Two weeks later, in Hong Kong, he boards a boat that will take him to the tournament island. Johnny Cage is also seen there, reassuring his agent and personal secretary who are afraid for his safety and the legitimacy of the tournament. Meanwhile, Kano and some members of his Black Dragon attempt to evade Sonya Blade, Agent Beran (whose name is not revealed here), and a man who is apparently Jax, as well as the rest of a U.S. Special Forces unit. Chased by Sonya, Kano leaps aboard the boat, all in accordance with his plan to loot all the riches he can find from Shang Tsung's palace.  In the mountains of rural Japan, Shang Tsung issues a challenge to Raiden, God of Thunder, inviting him to compete and reminding him that the tournament will be fought in his domain and under his rule. Back on the boat, Kano is trying to intimidate Cage and a fight breaks out, during which Liu Kang takes down Kano's associates. Sub-Zero watches the scene from above, unaware of the lurking spectre of Scorpion, who ambushes him from behind. Scorpion vows to kill Sub-Zero just as Sub-Zero killed Scorpion exactly two years ago. However, he states he is no mere murderer and, instead of killing the Sub-Zero on the boat, he will do so at the tournament. Sub-Zero says Scorpion is a fool to spare his life.  At the island, after a day of practice and training, Shang Tsung and Goro welcome the participants in the tournament and introduce the latest entrant, Sonya Blade, who had been trying to track Kano down to the island, but was captured and brought in by guards. Shang Tsung says that not only does Sonya's life depend on her performance, but so do the lives of her accompanying unit, who have also been captured. Goro then announces the start of the tournament and the story ends with the caption ""To be continued...at an arcade near you!""  Mortal Kombat II Collector's Edition Midway's comic book prologue to Mortal Kombat II was published by mail order during the release of the arcade version, much like with the original game's comic. Likewise, the second comic book reflects the events that were raised in the game and was also written, penciled, and colored by John Tobias. 100 million copies are said to had been printed.  The story begins with Johnny Cage recounting the events of the first game's final moments. He explains that Shang Tsung unleashed a horde of warriors on the Earthrealm fighters following Liu Kang's victory over Goro; and that Kano, Sonya, and himself were rushed by Goro at The Pit. Suddenly, an explosion knocked out the bridge from underneath them and everyone fell. Cage was saved, however, by Raiden, who informed him that Liu Kang had killed Shang Tsung and the island, which was held together by Tsung's presence, is self-destructing. Raiden further elaborates that Liu Kang has already escaped and, following the battle with Shang Tsung's army, Sub-Zero was killed by Scorpion, who then burst into flames and burned to ash before Raiden's eyes. The ensuing explosion apparently knocked Cage out and the next thing he recalls is seeing a U.S. military vessel. As it turns out, Cage has been telling the story to a disbelieving Jax and Lt. Steve Beran (a reference to Mortal Kombat series art director Steve Beran), who is more open to the story considering Cage has recounted the story five times with exactly the same details each time. Jax does not believe Cage's story on account of a distress signal from Sonya pinpointed to where they found Cage and because he thinks Sonya would never fight alongside Kano, even if, as Cage says, she had no choice. He nevertheless releases Cage due to lack of evidence.And   Meanwhile, in Outworld, Shao Kahn is being addressed by King Gorbak, who laments his son, Goro's, apparent death and places the blame on the shoulders of Shang Tsung, who is alive in Outworld. Gorbak calls for Tsung's death, but Kahn gives the him one chance to impress upon him why he should not personally slay him. Tsung instantly comes up with a plan: to lure the Earthrealm warriors to Outworld by breaching the dimensional gate and challenging them to Mortal Kombat. Only this time, the tournament will take place in Outworld and will be against the wishes of the Elder Gods. Kahn consults a Shadow Priest for advice and is told that due to the plan being against the wishes of the Elder Gods, it is impossible to clearly foresee the outcome. Should Kahn be victorious, his power will be unmatched and he will live for eternity. If the plan fails, however, Kahn will face eternal damnation. Gorbak says that if Tsung is to live then he will offer the services of Kintaro. As Shang Tsung's presence on Earthrealm no longer exists, Shao Kahn gives him a new physical form, one that is much younger in appearance. Kahn then sends Kitana, Mileena, Baraka, Kintaro, and Shang Tsung to destroy the Shaolin Monastery.  At the Special Forces base, a recording is received from Sonya and Kano that confirms Cage's story as true. Jax decides to make a trip to Hollywood to track down Cage. In China, Liu Kang has returned to Shaolin to find it ruined. The apparent sole survivor of the attacks, Kung Lao, appears from the shadows and sides with his friend by offering his word that he will fight against Outworld. At that moment, a Lin Kuei hover jet lands and a man in a suit claiming to be Sub-Zero hands Liu Kang his calling card. Liu Kang states that he saw Sub-Zero die and this man cannot possibly be the same person, but the ninja says he is the brother of the original Sub-Zero and remarks that his brother's unwillingness to adapt to technological change within the Lin Kuei is what made him obsolete. He shows the monks surveillance pictures the Lin Kuei took of Shang Tsung who appears to be searching for Cage, and the three then decide to journey to Hollywood. Cage is on set, filming a commercial for ""Cage Cologne."" (The director's name is ""E. Boon"" and bears resemblance to the franchise co-creator of the same name whilst the cameraman looks like fellow co-creator John Tobias.) At this point, Shang Tsung and the Outworld warriors sent by Kahn, flanked by numerous Masked Guards, arrive through a portal in the studio. As Jax and Beran demand to see Cage, he is blasted through the wall right in front of them and a massive fight breaks out. Sub-Zero's hover jet arrives about this time, being piloted by Smoke and a red-clad Lin Kuei member. Kung Lao and Liu Kang join the fight on Jax's side. Sub-Zero (now in his ninja uniform) leaps down and makes an attempt on Shang Tsung's life, but rebounds off an invisible Reptile. Before Reptile can kill Sub-Zero, however, Scorpion intervenes and attacks Reptile, saying he will defend Sub-Zero as penance for killing his brother. Before anything else can happen, though, Raiden arrives to stop the conflict. Shang Tsung now makes his challenge before returning to Outworld with his allies, leaving the Earthrealm warriors with the choice of accepting the challenge or forfeiting. Raiden informs Liu Kang that forfeit would weaken Earthrealm's standing with the Elder Gods and Liu Kang must accept the challenge. Jax is reluctant to join the tournament but is spurred on when Cage reveals Beran has been killed by Mileena. Sub-Zero also offers to compete. Raiden tells the gathered group of Jax, Liu Kang, Kung Lao, Johnny Cage, and Sub-Zero to ""Prepare yourselves, Mortals—for Kombat in the Outworld!"" The comic ends with the caption, ""To be continued on a game screen near you!""  Mortal Kombat 4 Limited Edition This comic book/artbook hybrid was created jointly by artists Alé Garza, Tomm Coker, Keron Grant, Garry Leach, Steve Pugh, and Mark Texeira. It was produced as a tie-in to the PlayStation and Nintendo 64 versions of Mortal Kombat 4, initially available as a pre-order incentive, and was later packaged with the PC CD-ROM version of the game.  Shinnok, ruler of the Netherrealm, is the first to emerge from the portal, followed by hundreds of demons, as well as the mysterious Reiko, and Scorpion, who is likely looking for another chance at life outside the Netherrealm. As Quan Chi, the one who gave Sindel the orb, discusses the success of the plan and says Tanya is to be thanked, Shinnok claims his true goal is to reach the heavens and confront the Elder Gods, and now he has that chance.  Several days later, in Earthrealm, Sub-Zero has travelled to the Temple of the Elements in China. He recalls what his elder brother, the original Sub-Zero, said: that the temple is home to an amulet designed to keep Shinnok in the Netherrealm. The amulet is protected by the elements of Wind, Earth, Water, and Fire (a reference to Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero). As Sub-Zero prepares to make peace with the elemental Gods, he sees what he believes to be a sign falling from the sky and decides to follow it after symbolically donning his mask once more out of respect not to the Lin Kuei, but to his brother. Miles away, Liu Kang quickly gets the upper hand, Kai jokes that this is easy enough for the Immortal Champion of Mortal Kombat. Suddenly, what Sub-Zero had seen falling from the sky collides with the ground near the monks. They inspect the scene and discover demons about to slit the throat of a white-haired man. Elsewhere, Sonya Blade is battling Jarek. Unable to get the upper hand over the last remaining Black Dragon clan member, Jarek escapes. Jax then contacts Sonya and tells her she is needed to investigate an interdimensional flux in southwestern China and a helicopter piloted by Johnny Cage is sent to pick her up. At the crater, Liu Kang and Kai battle the demons until Raiden shows up and destroys the demons. Raiden then explains that the man who fell from the sky is Fujin, God of Wind. He elaborates that he and Fujin are the last two remaining of Earth's Gods and that the Elder Gods have been weakened by Shinnok. He and Fujin withdraw to the Eternal Palace to formulate a plan of attack, after telling Liu Kang and Kai they must go to Edenia. Just as Kai is lamenting the impossibility of such a task, the helicopter carrying Sonya and Cage arrives. Sub-Zero too shows up to offer his help, correctly guessing that his brother may have played some part in Shinnok's return. Sonya uses Outer World Investigation Agency technology to open a portal to Edenia. On the other side, they are all greeted by Quan Chi, who welcomes the Earthrealm Warriors to a ""Mortal Kombat like you've never seen before."" The comic ends with the caption, ""To be continued in Mortal Kombat 4.""  Comics published by Malibu Comics  Comics published by DC Comics  Mortal Kombat VS DC Universe: Beginnings This short comic was illustrated by returning John Tobias and written by John Vogel, another of the original four co-creators of the Mortal Kombat franchise. It is the backstory comic for the 2008 game Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe, merging the worlds of Mortal Kombat and the DC Universe.  Mortal Kombat X: Blood Ties DC Comics announced a prequel comic book series for Mortal Kombat X that ""will feature many favorite characters and the next generation of Kombatants"" as being written by Shawn Kittelsen with interior art by Dexter Soy and covers by Ivan Reis. The series debuted in January 2015.  Blood Ties begins several years after the end of the ""Netherrealm War"", when Shinnok led Netherrealm in an attempt to conquer Earth and the other realms in the wake of Shao Khan's death. Shinnok was defeated and his undead armies pushed back, save for a number of dead warriors who were restored to life. Meanwhile, Outworld fell into a civil war as Mileena was overthrown by her warchief Kotal Kahn. In the Himalayan wilderness, Kenshi and his son Takeda flee from members of the Red Dragon and are saved by Scorpion and his rebuilt Shirai Ryu clan. Kenshi explains that he was infiltrating the Red Dragon when he was exposed, causing the group to target his son, whom he did not know he had. Kenshi leaves Takeda with Scorpion and leaves to complete his mission and find the Red Dragon's leader. Meanwhile, Kuai Liang, the younger Sub-Zero (who has also been returned to life) attacks a Red Dragon Temple in China. He enters the inner chamber only to be attacked by Kano, who has taken the Kamidogu (which are daggers in this timeline) within and scars him with it, stating that the Kamidogu are cursed.   Years later, Scorpion is approached by Raiden. After ensuring the Kamidogu is safe, he warns Scorpion of a demon from another realm that seeks to kill Earth's champions. Takeda's friend Fox is driven mad by voices: taking the Kamidogu, he is possessed by the demon and kills the rest of the Shirai Ryu, before being killed by Takeda and Scorpion. After paying their respects to the fallen, the two leave to find Raiden to seek answers. At the Sky Temple, Raiden converses with the Wind God Fujin, before using another dagger to invoke blood magic to find the demon. He discovers that they are too late and that events are already in motion. At a Special Forces base, Sonya Blade meets with Kotal Khan, Emperor of Outworld, who was captured entering Earth. Kotal explains that Mileena's resistance in Outworld is in league with the Red Dragon, and that he and his warriors are there to eliminate them. He asks for their cooperation, though Sonya refuses, and a fight ensues, but Raiden intervenes and Kotal departs, threatening to make them pay. Elsewhere, Sonya's daughter Cassie Cage, takes Jax's daughter Jacqui Briggs to what she believes to be a legal fight club, but are forced into an illegal death match against Frost. The match is interrupted by Black Dragon members Jarek and Tasia, who attempt to take Cassie and Jacqui. The two are sucked through a portal, but Cassie is able to take a picture of one of their abductors from her phone, Erron Black, one of the warriors who had been with Kotal, leaving it for Sonya. Sonya finds Cassie's phone and prepares to take her men and Johnny Cage (Cassie's father) to Outworld.  In Outworld, Kotal Khan sends his father to find Prince Goro who has disappeared while looking for Mileena. Unknown to Kotal, Goro has betrayed him and joined Mileena. Goro kills Kotal's father, driving Kotal to empower himself with his Kamidogu and face Goro personally, tearing his arms off. As Kotal and his warriors leave, they are confronted by Sonya demanding her daughter's location. Kotal denies involvement but agrees to help after Erron Black is shown to be involved. Elsewhere, Erron, Kano and the Black Dragon are taking Jacqui and Cassie to an unknown location when they are ambushed by Mavado and the Red Dragon. Kano abandons Erron who is wounded and the girls kill Mavado before being taken prisoner once more. In Earthrealm, Scorpion and Takeda near the Sky Temple and are attacked by Raiden, who is under the effects of the Kamidogu's curse. Takeda is seemingly killed, causing Scorpion to savagely beat Raiden, freeing him from the curse. Raiden saves Takeda's life and explains that following Shinnok's defeat the Elder Gods locked him away in another dimension. The Kamidogu were empowered with Blood Magic to act as the keys to his prison, and entrusted to powerful warriors by Raiden, keeping their true purpose and power hidden. Scorpion is furious at the deception. Raiden apologizes, explaining that he had not foreseen the demon corrupting the magic and cursing the blades. He informs him that all the blades are accounted for, save for one which has been stolen by Sub-Zero, who was possessed when Kano scarred him with one years earlier, and Scorpion agrees to help track him down. In Outworld, Mileena's chief advisor Reiko plots with the demon cleric Havik, who promises to grant him the power to become ruler of Outworld if he brings him the Kamidogu. Meanwhile, Sonya's team finds Erron Black who delivers a message that Reiko and Havik are waiting for them on Shang Tsung's island.

Morris Swadesh,"Morris Swadesh (; January 22, 1909 – July 20, 1967) was an American linguist who specialized in comparative and historical linguistics.  Swadesh was born in Massachusetts to Bessarabian Jewish immigrant parents. He completed bachelor's and master's degrees at the University of Chicago, studying under Edward Sapir, and then followed Sapir to Yale University where he completed a Ph.D. in 1933. Swadesh taught at the University of Wisconsin–Madison from 1937 to 1939, and then during World War II worked on projects with the United States Army and Office of Strategic Services. He became a professor at the City College of New York after the war's end, but was fired in 1949 due to his membership in the Communist Party. He spent most of the rest of his life teaching in Mexico and Canada.  Swadesh had a particular interest in the indigenous languages of the Americas, and conducted extensive fieldwork throughout North America. He was one of the pioneers of glottochronology and lexicostatistics, and is known for his creation of the Swadesh list, a compilation of basic concepts believed to present across cultures and thus suitable for cross-linguistic comparison. Swadesh believed that his techniques could discover deep relationships between apparently unrelated languages, thus allowing for the identification of macrofamilies and possibly even a ""Proto-Human"" language. His theories were often controversial, and some have been deprecated by later linguists.  Early life and education Swadesh was born in 1909 in Holyoke, Massachusetts, to Jewish immigrant parents from Bessarabia. His parents were multilingual, and he grew up with Yiddish, some Russian, and English as his first languages.  Swadesh earned his B.A. and M.A. from the University of Chicago, where he began studying with the linguist Edward Sapir. He followed Sapir to Yale University, where he earned his Ph.D. in 1933. Inspired by Sapir's early lists of word similarities among Native American languages, he began a life work in comparative linguistics.  Early career In the 1930s, Swadesh conducted extensive fieldwork on more than 20 indigenous languages of the Americas, with travels in Canada, Mexico, and the US.  He worked most prominently on the Chitimacha language, a now-extinct language isolate found among indigenous people of Louisiana.  His fieldnotes and subsequent publications constitute the main source of information on this extinct language. He also conducted smaller amounts of fieldwork on the Menominee and Mahican languages, in Wisconsin and New York, respectively; both are part of the Algonquian language family.  Swadesh taught linguistics and anthropology at the University of Wisconsin in Madison from 1937 to 1939. During this time he devised and organized the highly original ""Oneida Language and Folklore Project."" This program hired more than a dozen Oneida Indians in Wisconsin for a WPA project (under the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration) to record and translate texts in the Oneida language. (The Oneida were historically one of the five nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, with their historic territory located in central New York state, but some had moved to Wisconsin in the 19th century.) In this same period in other WPA projects, writers were recording state histories and guides, and researchers were collecting oral histories of African Americans who had been born into slavery before the end of the Civil War.  Swadesh was let go by the University of Wisconsin just as he was to begin the project. Floyd Lounsbury, then an undergraduate, was assigned to finish it. Lounsbury continued his studies in linguistics, later serving as Sterling Professor of Anthropology and Linguistics at Yale University.  In May 1939 Swadesh went to Mexico, where he had been hired to assist the government of Mexican President Lázaro Cárdenas, who was promoting the education of indigenous peoples. Swadesh learned the Purépecha language for this work. Together with rural school teachers, Swadesh worked in indigenous villages, teaching people to read first in their own languages, before teaching them Spanish. He worked with the Tarahumara, Purépecha, and Otomi peoples. Swadesh also learned Spanish in less than a year; he was fluent enough that he was able to give a series of linguistics lectures (in Spanish) at the Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolás de Hidalgo and publish his first book, ""La Nueva Filologia,"" in Spanish in 1941.   Returning to the U.S., during the Second World War Swadesh worked on military projects for the U.S. Army and the OSS to compile reference materials on Burmese, Chinese, Russian, and Spanish. He also wrote easy-to-learn textbooks for troops to learn Russian and Chinese.  Swadesh served in Burma, where Lt. Roger Hilsman described his linguistic skills as extraordinary. Swadesh learned enough of the Naga language, after spending only one day with a local guide, that he was able to give a ten-minute thank-you speech in that language. Hilsman recalled that Swadesh had been strongly opposed to racial segregation in the United States.  Red Scare In May 1949, Swadesh was fired by the City College of New York (CCNY) due to accusations that he was a Communist. That was during the Red Scare, and he was one of a number of anthropologists and other academics to be opposed by anticommunists during the McCarthy Era. Swadesh had been a member of the Denver Communist Party and was active in the protest movement against the execution of convicted spies,  Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. Swadesh continued to work in the United States until 1954, aided by limited funding from the American Philosophical Society of Philadelphia.  Later career In 1956 Swadesh returned to Mexico, where he took a position as researcher at the National Autonomous University of Mexico and taught linguistics at the National School of Anthropology and History (Escuela Nacional de Antropología e Historia), in Mexico City.  In 1966, he was appointed Professor of General Linguistics at the University of Alberta in Canada. He was developing plans for a major research project in Western Canada at the time of his death, in the summer of 1967.  Work in historical linguistics Swadesh is best known for his work in historical linguistics. Any language changes over centuries (consider, for example, the changes in English since the Middle Ages). Some languages diverge and become separate dialects, or languages that still belong to the same language family. Tracking similarities and differences between languages is part of historical linguistics.  Swadesh proposed a number of distant genetic links among languages.  He was the chief pioneer of lexicostatistics, which attempts to classify languages on the basis of the extent to which they have replaced basic words reconstructible in the proto-language, and glottochronology, which extends lexicostatistics by computing divergence dates from the lexical retention rate.  Swadesh became a consultant with the International Auxiliary Language Association, which standardized Interlingua and presented it to the public in 1951 (Esterhill 2000). In this role, he originated the lists of 100 and 200 basic vocabulary items, used (with some variation) in both lexicostatistics and glottochronology for comparison among languages. They have since been known as the Swadesh lists.  Some scholars considered Swadesh as a supporter of monogenesis, the theory that all languages have a common origin: ""Swadesh sought to show that all the world's languages are related in one large family"" (Ruhlen 1994:215). Others believe that Swadesh proposed early linkages, but believed that languages diverged immediately among peoples, as he expressed in his major, but unfinished work, The Origin and Diversification of Language (1971), published posthumously.  Personal life Swadesh was married for a time to Mary Haas, a fellow American linguist. He later married Frances Leon, with whom he worked in Mexico in the 1930s; they divorced in the late 1950s.  He married linguist Evangelina Arana after his return to Mexico in 1956.  He died in Mexico City in July 1967.

Stranger in the City,"Stranger in the City was the second solo album by John Miles and was released in 1977. It was awarded BPI Silver Certification on 19 July 1977.  Recording sessions with its producer and orchestral arranger Rupert Holmes started in the summer of 1976 in the United States when Miles was promoting his first album Rebel. The bulk of the album was recorded in England. For this album, Miles recruited Australian keyboardist Gary Moberley because Miles felt that his previous album was missing something funky. Both ""Remember Yesterday"" and ""Slow Down"" charted in the UK (respectively 32 and 10) and would be the last Miles singles to chart in Britain until 1983. Although the singles did fairly well, the album itself barely cracked the top 40 of the UK chart and reaching No. 82 in Canada. However, the cut ""Slow Down"" proved to be Miles' biggest US chart hit, peaking at No. 2 on the Billboard Disco chart, No. 34 on the Billboard Hot 100 in June 1977, but just No. 68 in Canada.  ""Remember Yesterday"" was written about Bob Marshall, who was according to Miles a very romantic type, because he drifted around from girl to girl.  A track of the title song had been recorded during the sessions of Rebel and was originally planned to be released as the B-side of ""Highfly"", but was shelved. It was orchestrated by Holmes who added percussion in New York performed by recording legend Jimmy Maelen. ""Manhattan Skyline"" was written about the first impressions Miles and Marshall had of New York and was recorded entirely in Manhattan. In 1977, singer-songwriter Melissa Manchester covered the Miles-Marshall ballad ""Time,"" which on Stranger in the City was performed solely by Miles at the piano, accompanied by strings and brass.  In 2007, the album was rereleased and remastered with several bonus tracks.

Tremembé people,"The Tremembé or Teremembé people are an indigenous people in the state of Ceará in Brazil.  Existing members of this ethnicity are centered in the Almofala district of the municipality of Itarema, and a few more in the neighboring municipalities of Acaraú and Itapipoca, on the Atlantic coast of Ceará, some 150 km north of the state capital of Fortaleza.   CEDI (1990) estimates that the Tremembé were 3,060 until 1986, but a more recent estimate places their numbers at merely 1,175. The Tremembé people live in tipis.  The Tremembé were one of the few Tapuia (""non-Tupi people"") that lived on the Brazilian coast on the advent of European contact c. 1500.  The Tremembé ranged over a large coastal area ranging across the modern states of Pará, Maranhão, Piauí and Ceará.  The ethno-historical map of Nimuendajú situates the traditional territory of the Tremembé in two segments along the northern Atlantic coast of Brazil.  The first segment stretched some 160 km from the bay of the Caeté river (by modern Bragança, Pará) to the bay of Turiaçu (Maranhão).  The second and principal segment stretched some 500 km, from the environs of São Luís, Maranhão as far as the region of Fortaleza, (Ceará).  The small interruption between the two stretches was occupied by a Tupinambá tribe.  The Tremembé population are estimated to have once numbered 20,000.  The Tremembé, a Tapuia tribe, were virtually surrounded by Tupi peoples - on the coast, there were Tupinambá to the west, and the Potiguara and Tabajara to the east.  In their hinterlands were other Tupi ethnicities, like the Guajá, the Urubú and the Guajajara.  In the 17th century, the Tremembé began to settle in the Jesuit mission of Aracati-mirím, at Aldeia do Cajueiro (now Almofala) by the Acaraú River in Ceará.  There was also a (non-Jesuit) mission at Tutóia (in Maranhão).  When the Portuguese minister, the Marquis of Pombal, issued his 1759 decrees expelling the Jesuits and dismantling their missions, the settled Tremembé population moved, along with a handful of priests, to Vila Nova do Soure (Caucaia).  However, they did not adapt well to their new environment, and were allowed to return to their old mission settlement, the Aldeia do Cajueiro, which was renamed Almofala and incorporated as an Indian town in 1766.  The Tremembé were dispossessed of most their remaining lands in the aftermath of the 1854 ""Lei da Terra"" (land tenure decree) of the Empire of Brazil.  The state governor of Ceará issued a decree in 1863 declaring the Tremembé an extinct people, remaining Indians officially regarded as caboclos (mixed-race) or ""descendents"" of Indians, but not an existing ethnicity.  Nonetheless, the Tremembé resurged and received recognition from the Fundação Nacional do Índio in the 1980s.  Language   The original language of the Tremembé is extinct. Current members of the ethnicity speak Portuguese as their mother tongue.  The language is unclassified, but generally believed to have not been part of the Tupi–Guarani family (thus, ""Tapuia"", or non-Tupi). Nonetheless, the Tremembé may have borrowed a considerable number of Tupi words through interaction with their Tupi neighbors.

Sitana visiri,"Sitana visiri, the palm leaf fan-throated lizard, is a species of agamid lizard. It is endemic to the Tamil Nadu region of India.  Etymology The Sitana visiri species epithet is derived from the regional Tamil language word for a hand-crafted fan made from palm leaf (also the source of the common name), because the dewlap of S. visiri resembles a local palm-leaf fan.  Description Sitana visiri can be distinguished from other members of Sitana genus in the spinaecephalus clade by a strongly serrated dewlap with a large orange spot surrounded by extensive blue color. The dewlap of S. visiri extends up to 56% of its trunk, which is proportionally larger than that of Sitana ponticeriana, S. bahiri, and S. devakai. S. visiri is differentiated from the species in the ponticeriana clade in having a larger snout-vent length.  Ecology Sitana visiri is endemic to the Tamil Nadu region of India where it lives in coastal sand dunes, grasslands, plains, and areas dominated by Prosopis juliflora. S. visiri occurs in similar regions alongside Eutropis carinata, Eutropis bibronii, and Calotes versicolor. S. virisi is a oviparous or egg laying species, with breeding males been observed in fall (September and October) and hatchlings observed in January.

Dongas road protest group,"The Dongas Tribe was a collection of road protesters and travellers in England, noted for their occupation of Twyford Down outside Winchester, Hampshire. The name Dongas comes from the Matabele word for ""gully"", given by Winchester locals to the deep drovers' tracks on Twyford Down.  John Vidal, writing in The Guardian in 2012, said of The Dongas that ""the 15-20 urban youths who camped out to try to defend Twyford Down in 1992 are recognised to have fired up British environmental protest and kickstarted a major shift in green attitudes in both government and the public.""  History  The Twyford Down protest was a protest against the M3 motorway extension which destroyed some rich ecological sites, one of the very few habitats of the Chalkhill Blue butterfly and six species of rare orchid, and ancient monuments there (SSSI and Scheduled Ancient Monument). The Conservative government was planning to construct a new roadway through the area in order to save three minutes of transit time between London and Southampton.  Following ""Yellow Wednesday"", when hordes of police and security guards invaded the camp to bulldoze the area, the Dongas Tribe left Twyford Down for Bramdean Common.  Earth First!, who had been heavily involved in the setting up and support of the camp and actions, continued the protests and restarted a camp in Plague Pits Valley.  They constituted about twenty people. Of them, seven were sent to prison in 1993 for breaking an injunction. In one incident, around fifty protesters chained themselves to a bridge, leading to the arrest of some. At least one protester (Paul Kingsnorth) subsequently sued the police and received a $5000 settlement.  Some of the 'original Dongas' (as they became called) of the mid 1990s were musicians who made a living by busking, sometimes using traditional music from Brittany.  The first child born in the Dongas tribe, to Rosie Lambert, was named May Brigit ""Donga"" Lambert and was born on 1 May 1994, Beltane and May Day.  In late 2012, original members of the Dongas, as well as hundreds of others, returned to the hillside on the protest's 20th anniversary. They expressed warnings about the government's more than forty new road plans.  Influence  The Dongas road protests inspired a major change in green attitudes among both the public and the government, radicalizing a generation of British youth. Among them, Paul Kingsnorth of The Dark Mountain Project credits his arrest at Twyford Down as his impetus for engaging in further protests.

Casablanca (novella),"Casablanca is a novella written by Edgar Brau in Nevada, United States, in November–December 2002. In the story, set in Buenos Aires Province, Argentina, a rich Argentine ranch owner builds a replica of Rick's Café Américain on his estate, with the idea of reproducing in it, by means of doubles, the most important scenes of the movie  Casablanca.  Plot summary Casablanca begins when the narrator, who is driving his car to Mar del Plata seaside resort, is caught by a big storm. While looking for some shelter he comes across a place similar to Rick's Café Américain. He gets out of the car and, almost blinded by the rain, hurries to the entrance door. Just then somebody starts playing ""As Time Goes By""  on a piano at the back of the room. The player is identical to Sam, but much older; he is wearing the same suit jacket that is shown in the film, but worn out now. In one of the corners, an old man in dark glasses, who looks like Humphrey Bogart, is dozing at a table. When the song is over, the black man starts to tell the narrator the story of the place and of the people who lived there.  It all started, he says, in the early fifties, when the owner of those lands, a rich man very similar to  Sydney Greenstreet —the actor who interpreted señor Ferrari— decides to build a replica of Rick's café to reproduce in it the main scenes of the movie. With this purpose, he sends agents around the country and abroad, to look for people whose physical appearance is identical to the characters. He keeps for himself the role of Señor Ferrari. When the cast is ready, they rehearse for some months; their voices and accents must sound like the English spoken in the original version. To imitate the black-and-white movie, everything in the place is in lighter or darker shades of grey.  When the café is opened, success is enormous. The people who visit it have the feeling they are “inside” the famous movie. Señor Ferrari's dream (“Ferrari” is the name given to the ranch owner in the story) Señor Ferrari's dream of turning the movie Casablanca into reality has come true.  Some years of splendor follow, but an epidemic of hoof-and-mouth disease and an unexpected flood affect Señor Ferrari's property, and he goes bankrupt. He speaks with President Perón to get a license to play for real money at the roulette wheel and the poker tables (up to that moment people pretended that they were gambling). President Perón —who had visited the place some months before and had an affair with Ilsa (Ferrari's lover) — agrees to it.  The café manages to survive, although far from its past magnificence. Then a military coup overthrows Perón, and the casino is closed. It is a hard blow for Ferrari, who commits suicide. In his will, he states that the café will remain the property of his employees, provided that they never shut it down or put it up for sale.  In the following weeks, they try to do their best to make ends meet, but after a while, some of them give up and desert the place. In a few months, the only ones who remain are Rick, Ilsa, Sam, Renault, and Ugarte. To make a living they decide to perform isolated scenes, which are shown to the few tourists who happen to go by.  Time passes, and not only the place deteriorates but the health of its dwellers as well. The moment the narrator arrives, Sam can offer nothing but an account of what happened in that fantastic Casablanca, and introduce Rick and Ilsa, who are much older now (Rick is blind; Ilsa makes a brief appearance, dressed as Ingrid Bergman in one of the scenes of the movie). In a vase placed near the exit door, visitors leave a few coins.  Meanwhile, the storm has subsided.  Sam plays ""As Time Goes By"" once again, to say goodbye now. The narrator gets into his car and, with the feeling that he has witnessed a sequel to the movie that Hollywood never made, leaves the place.  Background In 2002 Edgar Brau was invited by the University of Nevada, Reno, as visiting professor and writer-in-residence for the fall 2002 – spring 2003. As writer-in-residence he had to write a work of fiction during his stay. He had been considering the possibility of writing a fantastic narration (in the line of his The Poem or The Buddha's Eyes) that would be a tribute to his father's movie-theater, where he had spent his childhood years. As he said:  “I started Casablanca with the idea of writing a fantastic story that would pay tribute to my father's cinema, where I spent my early years. I wanted that cinema, the building itself, to be very much present in the work. But I soon realized that the narration was leading somewhere else, and as one must never go against the way a story unfolds, I decided to put off that homage for another occasion. Later on I will do it, and with a fantastic story, as I said”.  So, the novella developed a realistic tone and it had little to do with that cinema of his childhood. It was written in November–December 2002, in Reno, and corrected in February 2003 at Lake Tahoe.  Main characters Señor Ferrari A rich Argentine ranch owner, who offers all his possessions to his admired Ingrid Bergman as long as she marries him. His proposal is rejected, so he decides to create his own Casablanca on his estate, and to play the role of Señor Ferrari.  Sam He is from Uruguay. He was working as a bellhop at a hotel in the City of Buenos Aires when Señor Ferrari came across him. He's the true narrator in the novella.  Rick Argentinean, a former high school literature teacher. He's very fond of French authors and given to drinking. When the novella starts he is over eighty years old and blind.  Ilsa Australian. She earned her living as a trapeze artist at an American circus. On a Brazil tour she was hired by one of Señor Ferrari's agents to work as Ingrid Bergman's double. Foul mouthed and energetic, she becomes Ferrari's mistress and protégée. In the story, Sam calls her “Elsa”.  Ugarte Before being hired by Señor Ferrari, he sang tangos at a strip-tease night club in the City of Buenos Aires.  Fortunato A homeless child adopted by Ilsa and Sam when he was a few months old. In the story he is around ten. Although he does not know the language, he reads French books to Rick.  The Narrator Nothing is said about his age, physical appearance or profession.  Theme  The novella Casablanca is a perfect metaphor of Argentina. In the story, the Argentine Casablanca is a copy of the famous movie; in real life, Argentina was built as a copy of certain European countries, a copy, so to say, that “Europeans in exile” (as Borges defined himself and Argentines) made of a movie entitled “Europe”.  The splendor of the Argentine Casablanca was weakened, at first, by certain natural disasters, and later on by catastrophical political events; the splendor of Argentina, was eroded mainly by those unfortunate political events. Among them (and as a parallel between real life and fiction which Brau's work reflects perfectly), are the military coups that shook the nation in the period 1930-1980.  In the novella, the coup d´état which overthrew President Perón in 1955 was the beginning of the end for Ferrari's fabulous work, for his Casablanca —which had already been “hurt” by the flood and the hoof-and-mouth disease—. In real life, the beginning of the end for that other “Casablanca”, Argentina, took place some years earlier, in 1930 (when José Félix Uriburu led a military coup against President Hipólito Yrigoyen), and the signs of decadence were revealed more slowly.  The novella has an open ending. The same thing sometimes happens in real life.  Translation into English The translation of Casablanca by Andrea G. Labinger was finalist in 2007 Pen USA Literary Award in the category of Translation.

In April 2008 Drinkhall signed with the German team TTC Indeland Jülich for the 2008–09 season, having previously played for another German club, Goennern. In December 2008 he was runner-up at the World Junior Table Tennis Championships in Madrid, losing to Chen Chien-an in the final. In 2010 Drinkhall signed with the Belgian Super Division club Nodo TTC Ekeren.  At the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi he won a silver medal in the Men's Team event and a bronze medal in the Mixed Doubles events.  Drinkhall has been National Champion in every age group so far eligible to compete in - Under 10, Under 11, Under 12, Under 14, Under 17, and Senior Men. Paul became the youngest player since Chester Barnes to win the English Senior Men's title in Sheffield in March 2007 when he overcame the much more experienced former champion Alex Perry from Devon in the 4 - 1 contest.  Drinkhall moved to Italy in September 2011, joining the Sterilgarda club with the intention of raising his performances in the run-up to the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.  2012 Olympic Games Paul Drinkhall qualified for the 2012 Olympic games through a host nation place. In the singles event, Paul defeated Kuwait's Ibrahim Alhasan 4–0 in the preliminary round then beat world ranked 52, Yang Zi from Singapore. In the last 32 stage, Paul lost to Germany's Dimitrij Ovtcharov.  Post-2012 Olympics In 2012 Drinkhall joined Werder Bremen's table tennis team and returned to the table tennis Bundesliga after previous spells with Goennern, TTC Indeland Jülich and SV Plüderhausen. Paul was part of the Werder Bremen team that won the Bundesliga that season.  Paul Drinkhall married Joanna Parker, also a professional table tennis player and a multiple English champion, in August 2013.  Drinkhall became only the second English player (after Carl Prean) to win a tournament on the ITTF World Tour Open circuit when he won the Spanish Open in April 2014. This was the first win for a British player in a World Tour singles event in 18 years.  The following month he was part of the England men's team which clinched promotion to the top level of world table tennis at the World Team Championships in Japan.  In June 2014 it was announced that he would be leaving Werder Bremen and rejoining TTC Nodo for the 2014–15 season in order to obtain more playing time, although Werder said that Drinkhall would continue to train with the German club when he was not playing for Nodo or the English national team. Paul won the Belgian League that same season with Nodo.  Drinkhall represented England at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, winning a silver medal in the team competition as Singapore took gold in a repeat of the 2010 result. Paul and Joanna Drinkhall subsequently won a gold in the mixed doubles competition, defeating fellow English pairing Liam Pitchford and Tin-Tin Ho in the final.   In November 2014, Drinkhall reached the final of the Russian Open, beating several top-25 players along the way, including top seed Dimitrij Ovtcharov and third seed Marcos Freitas. His results on the ITTF World Tour meant he qualified for the Grand Finals to be played in Bangkok in December, becoming the first Englishman to compete at the event since 1996. His performances also lifted him to a new career high of No 33 in the ITTF world rankings.  At the inaugural European Games in Baku in June 2015, Drinkhall was seeded 16 and reached the semi-finals, losing to top seed Dimitrij Ovtcharov. He was then beaten in the bronze medal play-off by Lei Kou.  In November 2015, Drinkhall won the men's singles at the Aquece Rio International Tournament - the test event for the Rio Olympics.  In March 2016, Drinkhall was part of the England team, alongside Liam Pitchford and Sam Walker, which won bronze medals at the World Team Championships in Malaysia, England's first medal at that level since 1983 and the first time a newly promoted team had earned a podium place at the event.  The same month, he won the national men's singles title for the fifth time in his career.  Drinkhall represented Team GB in singles and team event at the Rio 2016 Olympics, becoming only the third Brit in history to reach the last 16 stage of the singles. In the team event, alongside Liam Pitchford and Sam Walker, he helped GB beat France in the first round, before GB were knocked out by China.  In March 2017, Paul became the English Senior National Champion for the 6th time with a 4–2 victory over Sam Walker in the final.  In February 2018, Drinkhall was part of the England squad alongside Liam Pitchford, Sam Walker, David McBeath and Tom Jarvis which won bronze medals by reaching the semi-finals of the ITTF Team World Cup in front of a home crowd at the Copper Box Arena in London.  At the Commonwealth Games in Australia in 2018, Drinkhall won the gold medal in the men's doubles alongside Liam Pitchford and was part of the England squad which won men's team bronze, alongside Pitchford, Sam Walker and David McBeath.  In 2019, Drinkhall became the first English player to win two ITTF World Tour events when he won the Serbia Open.  In 2021, Drinkhall qualified for the Tokyo Olympics at the last minute following Samsonov's abrupt withdrawal from the event.

Empress Ma (Han dynasty),"Empress Ma (馬皇后, personal name unknown) (40 – August 16, 79), formally Empress Mingde (明德皇后, literally, ""the understanding and virtuous empress""), was an empress during the Eastern Han Dynasty from the year 60 until her death. Her husband was Emperor Ming of Han.  Family background and marriage to Crown Prince Zhuang  In 40, the eventual Empress Ma was born to Emperor Guangwu's General Ma Yuan, known for his expeditions against Vietnamese rebellions and his exhortations on personal living, and his wife Lady Lin (藺夫人). Ma was a marquess, and Lady Ma was therefore born into comfort and wealth, as a member of a noble family.  In 49, however, things would change. Ma, while on expedition against the Wulin tribes (in modern eastern Guizhou and northwestern Hunan), died during the campaign from a plague, which also killed a large number of his soldiers. After his death, Ma's deputy Geng Shu (耿舒), who had disagreed with Ma's strategy, and Emperor Guangwu's son-in-law Liang Song (梁松), who had prior grudges against Ma, falsely accused Ma of many crimes — most of which is unknown to us. Two specific accusations that are known are that Ma, by the route he took against the Wulin tribes, was responsible for the plague, and that he had, while on campaigns, embezzled pearls and rhinoceros horns. (The later accusation was a misunderstanding in that one of Ma's favorite foods — which he considered capable of warding off plagues — was Job's tears (Chinese pearl barley), which was produced in southern China and northern Vietnam, which Ma had transported in large quantities back to the capital Luoyang.) Guangwu believed these false accusations and posthumously stripped Ma of his marquess title and fief, thus depriving the Ma family of its major source of income.  The other noble families began to look down on the Ma family. Lady Ma had been previously engaged to marry a son of another noble family, the Dous. The Dous began to have second thoughts of the marriage, believing that Lady Ma was no longer worthy to marry their son. Ma's cousin Ma Yan (馬嚴) and mother Lady Lin were angered by the Dous' attitude, and resolved to dissolve the engagement and offer Lady Ma to Crown Prince Liu Zhuang as a consort instead.  As consort to the crown prince  As a consort to the crown prince, Consort Ma was described to be excellent at serving her mother-in-law, Empress Yin Lihua, and she quickly became Empress Yin's favorite.  She was also cordial and warm to her fellow consorts.  As a result, she also became a favorite of Crown Prince Zhuang.  One of her virtues was said to be her willingness, or indeed, eagerness, to find appropriate beautiful ladies in waiting for Crown Prince Zhuang to have sexual relations with, because at that point Crown Prince Zhuang had not had many sons.  Consort Ma herself was childless.  Her older sister's daughter, Consort Jia, was also a consort to the crown prince, and Consort Jia bore a son named Liu Da (劉炟).  Crown Prince Zhuang instructed Consort Ma to adopt Prince Da as her son, and she did so.  She raised him so carefully and lovingly that he never regarded anyone but her as his mother.  As empress  In 57, Emperor Guangwu died, and Crown Prince Zhuang ascended the throne as Emperor Ming.  Consort Ma became an imperial consort.  In 60, he created her empress and created Prince Da crown prince.  As empress, Empress Ma was described as humble and solemn, and she loved reading.  She often wore the less expensive white silk without elaborate designs.  The imperial consorts and princesses were all surprised by how thrifty she was and yet impressed by her.  Emperor Ming often consulted her on important matters of state when he could not make a decision quickly.  She would analyze the issues carefully and come up with good suggestions.  One thing she was described of having never done was to request favors for her brothers and cousins.  Because of this, Emperor Ming continued to respect and love her.  In 71, as mass tortures and executions were being carried out as a result of a conspiracy engaged in by Emperor Ming's brother Liu Ying, the Prince of Chu, Empress Ma interceded on the accused people's behalf, and as a result, Emperor Ming tapered off on his efforts to eliminate anyone who might be even remotely connected with the conspiracy.  In 72, when Emperor Ming created his sons princes, he gave them relatively small principalities.  Empress Ma objected — she did not understand why these principalities were only half as large as the ones for Emperor Guangwu's sons.  Emperor Ming responded that of course his sons could not be compared with his father's sons — a response that she would remember and agree with.  In 75, Emperor Ming died, and Crown Prince Da ascended the throne as Emperor Zhang. Empress Ma became empress dowager.  As empress dowager  Empress Dowager Ma continued to be known for her humility and good judgment as empress dowager. Emperor Zhang, who was close to his uncles – Empress Dowager Ma's brothers Ma Liao (馬廖), Ma Fang (馬防), and Ma Guang (馬光) – wanted to promote them quickly, but Empress Dowager Ma did not urge it. They did all become important court officials, however. In 77, when Emperor Zhang wanted to further create his uncles marquesses, Empress Ma refused, and issued an edict stating that – just as how Emperor Ming had told her that his sons could not be compared with his father's sons – the Mas could not be compared with the Yins and the Guos (the family of Emperor Guangwu's first empress Guo Shengtong).  She further ordered the local governments not to accept improper requests from the Ma family.  If there were members of Ma or other closely related families who live exuberantly, Empress Dowager Ma would remove their names from the rolls of the nobles and exile them.  Empress Dowager Ma also established a textile factory and a mulberry garden for silkworms, which became a fairly productive industry for the imperial household.  In her spare time, she often discussed important matters of state with Emperor Zhang and taught his sons the Confucian classics – particularly the Analects of Confucius.  In 79, over Empress Dowager Ma's objection, Emperor Zhang created his uncles marquesses.  However, under pressure from the empress dowager, the new marquesses, after their requests to decline the fiefs were denied by Emperor Zhang, resigned their government posts.  Later that year, Empress Dowager Ma died at the age of 39. She was buried with her husband.  References    Book of Later Han, vols. 10, Part 1, 24.  Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 44, 45, 46.

The new emperor's mother Empress Dowager Dou was not only the widow but also the grandmother of her husband's predecessor; she thus became known as Grandmother Dou.   She ruled alongside her grandson until he reached adulthood when she retired to private life. The reigns of both Emperor Cheng and his father were marked by political turmoil caused by factional struggles between rival princes over control of government posts.    In addition there were frequent rebellions against imperial rule from various parts of China including Shanyuan Commandery on China's northern border which threatened the safety of the capital Luoyang.   To deal with these problems Emperor Cheng appointed several generals whose loyalty could be trusted such as Liu Bang, Zhang Liang, Guan Zhong, Xun You, Sun Shangxiang, Zhou Cang, and others.   He also sent out expeditions led by some of them into enemy territory where they defeated rebels or foreign invaders and brought back large amounts of plunder that greatly increased their prestige among the people.

Sydney lockout laws,"The Sydney lockout laws were introduced by the Government of New South Wales from February 2014 to January 2020 in the CBD and Oxford Street (and until March 2021 for Kings Cross) with the objective of reducing alcohol-fuelled violence. The legislation required 1.30am lockouts and 3am last drinks at bars, pubs and clubs in the Sydney CBD entertainment precinct. The precinct, defined in regulations, was bounded by Kings Cross, Darlinghurst, Cockle Bay, The Rocks and Haymarket.  While data showed that the lockout laws helped reduce alcohol-related violence, concerns were raised about the impact of the law on Sydney's night-time economy.  In 2016, the law was subject to an independent review, conducted by Ian Callinan. In response, the NSW Government announced it would ""maintain Sydney’s lockout laws and implement the key recommendations"" which included relaxing the last drinks and lockout laws by half an hour for live entertainment venues in a two-year trial.  In September 2019, a NSW Parliamentary committee recommended that the lockout laws should be removed by the end of the year, with the exception of Kings Cross, where restrictions will be retained. Medical professionals and representatives of emergency services workers opposed repeal.  On 28 November 2019, the NSW Government announced that the lockout laws would be lifted in Sydney's CBD and Oxford Street from 14 January 2020. On 8 February 2021, the NSW government announced the lockout laws would be lifted from the remaining area Kings Cross from 8 March 2021.  Context  Teenager Daniel Christie died in January 2014, the victim of a one-hit punch. He had been out celebrating New Year's Eve in Kings Cross. His assault, a random attack at 9pm, was just metres from the site where teenager Thomas Kelly had been fatally punched in July 2012.   Similar killings on the streets of Kings Cross and the Sydney CBD in that period included those of Calum Grant in 2011, Wilson Duque Castillo in 2012 and Lucio Rodrigues in 2013, bringing the tally to ""five deaths in three years"".  Christie's family called upon politicians to set laws that would help to stop alcohol-related violence. Within weeks of Christie's death, the O'Farrell ministry met to discuss a new package of measures to address community concerns on the issue.  Legislation  Legislative change Barry O'Farrell announced his Government's plan for the new lockout laws on 21 January 2014. The Government introduced the Liquor Amendment Bill 2014 to parliament on 31 January 2014, to amend the Liquor Act 2007 and the Liquor Regulations 2008. The Bill would give the minister a regulation-making power to declare areas as prescribed precincts and impose conditions on licensed premises within those precincts. The regulations defined the new 'CBD entertainment precinct' as the region bounded by Kings Cross, Darlinghurst, Cockle Bay, The Rocks and Haymarket, including parts of Surry Hills. The Government also increased maximum prison sentences and introduced new mandatory minimums for various drug-fuelled violent offences.  Exemptions  Within the CBD entertainment precinct  The regulations exempt venues within the defined CBD entertainment precinct that have poker machines installed. These venues may permit entrance to patrons on the condition that they do not serve alcohol past 1.30am and do not provide entertainment other than poker machines and background entertainment. Most licensed small bars (maximum 60 people), restaurants and tourist accommodation may stay open past 3am, although alcohol service is not permitted after this time.  Outside the CBD entertainment precinct  The entertainment precinct defined in regulations ends at Darling Harbour and does not include The Star Casino, which is one of Sydney's most violent licensed venues.  Impact  Effect on reducing offences A report from the NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research (BOCSAR) released in April 2015 showed a 26% reduction in assaults in the lockout area, and a 32% reduction in assaults in Kings Cross. In a March 2017 report, however, areas adjacent to the lockout precinct showed a 12% increase in assaults, with a 17% increase in ""easy-to-reach"" areas. Representatives from peak medical organisations such as the Australian Medical Association NSW and hospitals such as St Vincent's testified to the efficacy of the laws in reducing violence, trauma and injury, saying they made a difference: “We've gone from a time when people were dying, to a time when people are not dying.”  Effect on CBD business  Several venues in Kings Cross have closed since 2014, with several owners blaming the lockout laws for shutting down the late-night economy or a decrease in trade.   Pedestrian traffic dropped by 40% in Kings Cross, falling from a Saturday peak of 5,590 per hour between 1am and 2am in 2010, to a Saturday peak of 3,888 between 12am and 1am in 2015. Industry groups have claimed an 80 per cent reduction of foot traffic in Kings Cross, while the Foundation for Alcohol Research and Education claimed the decline is closer to 19 per cent.  Controversy  Controversy over the lockout laws centred around finding a balance between encouraging ""night life"" with the associated sale of alcohol and preventing injury resulting from alcohol-related violence.  Support  Support for the laws came from medical personnel who ""have to pick up the pieces"". A Fairfax-commissioned ReachTEL poll of 1,600 voters taken in August 2016 found ""broad support within the community for keeping a 1.30am lockout (70 per cent) and retaining the 3am 'last drinks' time (72 per cent)"". It further found that ""three-quarters of young people support existing laws"" and that a majority of NSW voters said the lockout laws should be extended across the state.  Opposition  Opposition to the laws came mainly from the hotel industry and business. When the law was first introduced, the NSW branch of the Australian Hotels Association said that the law would negatively impact Sydney's nighttime economy. As at April 2016, they were advocating for the lockouts to be replaced with a 'no new patrons' policy, whereby patrons arriving after 3am would have to book ahead and alcohol service could continue after 1.30am.  In September 2015, a 1000-member group named 'Reclaim the Streets' marched in protest of the lockout laws, claiming that the lockout had not solved the problem of alcohol-fuelled violence, instead pushing it into neighbouring suburbs, including Newtown. Other protests organised by 'Keep Sydney Open' such as one on 21 February 2016, attended by members of bands to protest the lockout laws, and another in October of the same year, called for the NSW Government to lift lockout laws. Organisers claimed that the laws alienated young people and destroyed the live music scene, while allowing The Star casino to remain open.   A ReachTel poll commissioned by The Sun-Herald in October 2018 found a decline in support for the laws. Citing a decline in patronage in parts of the city, Lord Mayor Clover Moore supported reversing the lockouts.  Callinan and other reviews An independent review of the lockout laws, conducted by Ian Callinan, was released in September 2016. The review considered the impact and effectiveness of the laws, but did not address some of the complaints the community had about the laws, including the impact on employment in the precincts. While largely backing the laws, the review recommended relaxing the 1.30am lockout to 2am for live entertainment venues.  In December 2016, the NSW Government released its response to the review and said it would relax the lockout law for live music venues by a half-hour in a two-year trial. In line with the review, takeaway and home delivery alcohol sales will be extended from 10pm to 11pm across the State.  In October 2018, Members of the NSW Government were reported to be considering relaxing the laws due to the negative impact on businesses and the reputation of Sydney on people seeking to holiday in the city.   In September 2019, the Premier hoped to introduce legislation to change or scrap them and a Parliamentary committee recommended that the sale of takeaway alcohol be extended, although retained in Kings Cross because the area was ""not yet sufficiently changed to warrant a complete reversal"". While the point was made that the lockout laws hoped to pre-empt crimes by predicting them, others did not see any urgency in changing the laws, arguing instead for ""gradual easing of restrictions and monitoring the changes at each stage"".

Lockouts are enforced by police and occur on weekends (Friday night until Sunday morning) from 1 November through 31 March each year; they also apply over public holidays such as Christmas Day or New Year's Eve when there has been no prior agreement between employers and employees about working those days.  Lockouts do not affect people who live outside city limits but work within them nor do they prevent workers leaving their place of employment if required under contract law.   The current system was introduced after a series of violent confrontations at Kings Cross pubs following the introduction of new licensing laws which allowed bars to stay open later than previously permitted.

West London Orbital,"The West London Orbital is a proposed extension to the London Overground railway system in London, UK. The extension would make use of a combination of existing freight and passenger lines including the Dudding Hill Line, North London Line and Hounslow Loop. The route would run for approximately 11 miles (17 km) from  and  at the northern end to  at the western end via , Neasden, Harlesden, , South Acton and .  If the extension were opened, it would improve rail connectivity across West and North-West London and establish a number of new connections to existing radial rail infrastructure including Thameslink, the Jubilee line, the Bakerloo line, High Speed 2, Crossrail and the Piccadilly line. It is anticipated the line would be operational by the mid-2020s, due to the fact that it makes use of existing underused rail infrastructure rather than requiring significant lengths of new track or tunnels to be built. The planned line would follow a portion of the route of the former Super Outer Circle that was operated by the Midland Railway from 1878 to 1880.  The scheme is supported by the Mayor and Transport for London's Transport Strategy; it is still at the proposal stage, although TfL published a business case for the plans in August 2019.  Detail of the scheme  The West London Orbital line consists of a number of distinct sections: The Dudding Hill Line, the North London Line and the Hounslow Loop. The Dudding Hill line itself has had no scheduled passenger service for over a century. It has no stations, no electrification and a  speed limit with semaphore signalling, and is lightly used by freight and very occasional passenger charter trains. It is roughly  long.  Near the site of  the West London Orbital would connect to the existing North London Line, and then further south at Acton, use the link down to the Hounslow Loop to reach  and . Taken together, this set of routes would be known as the “West London Orbital” railway.  In March 2017 the West London Alliance group of local authorities commissioned a study to assess the feasibility of the line so that a decision could be taken as to whether it merited pursuing further. This study found that:   The route is technically feasible.  The scheme represents a high value for money, with a benefit-cost ratio (BCR) of 2.2.  Peak three-hour demand at 3,000 passengers southbound and 2,500 passengers northbound in 2031. This suggests that the level of passenger demand may be able to sustain a regular four-trains-per-hour or more service along the line.   The line would enable significant new development to be undertaken along its length, supporting the creation of new homes and jobs.  It would drastically improve orbital travel times around West London compared with the equivalent journey by car. For example, a journey from Barnet to Park Royal (enabling a change on to Crossrail or HS2 services) would take approximately  minutes. A trip from Acton to Cricklewood or Brent Cross would take approximately  minutes. A journey along the whole line from Barnet to Hounslow would take approximately 39 minutes (times the same for reverse journeys).   Eight trains per hour in each direction would be achievable given existing traffic along the length of the route.  It would connect town centres and regeneration areas, including the 45,000 new homes and 86,000 new jobs that will be created at Old Oak Common, Wembley and Brent Cross regeneration areas, putting a greater number of jobs and homes within easy reach of one another and supporting intensification in growth areas.  It would remove a significant number of cars from the road, reducing congestion and improving journey times, particularly along the North Circular Road, as the population of London approaches 10 million over the next 20 years.   It would allow passengers in outer London to access new services on Crossrail and HS2 via an interchange at .  Potential to unlock significant amount of new housing.  It would help to reduce passenger demand for central London stations such as King's Cross and  for orbital journeys that currently require travellers to go into central London before then travelling back out to reach their destination. In June 2017 Transport for London published the Mayor's Transport Strategy, which stated that London government would work with the relevant boroughs to explore the feasibility of the proposed service, that would become the West London Orbital. In March 2018 the Mayor's Transport Strategy was published, which includes a proposal for this orbital connection to Old Oak between Hounslow and Brent Cross.

West London Orbital railway line under Proposal 88. The mayor's proposal for the service highlights that utilising new and existing orbital connections in west London could also improve public transport connections in the city centre.  The West London Alliance group of local authorities have expressed support for the West London Orbital Scheme, and have confirmed that it will be incorporated in to all Local Plans. Discussions are currently underway between West London councils and London government on the future of the scheme.  A number of independent analyses of the scheme have been published, including by Modern Railways magazine and the independent blogging community  In April 2019, £320 million of funding was approved for a new Brent Cross West railway station, that would also serve the potential new service.  In June 2019, Transport for London published the Strategic Outline Business Case for the scheme and concluded that there was a strong case for the scheme as it had a medium to high benefit-cost ratio. TfL found that for 8 trains per hour in the core the BCR was between 1.4 and 1.8 and for 4 trains per hour it would be 1.7 to 2.0. As the scheme was found to have a strong business case, TfL stated that it intended to proceed to the next stage which will look at how the scheme can be funded. A more detailed business case is expected to be developed in the next 18 months.  Earlier proposals  A number of routes have previously been examined for new orbital tube lines and improved connectivity across West and North London. It was considered that the most likely route of the previous proposal would be a north–south route running from Brent Cross to Surbiton, via Wembley Park, Ealing Broadway, Richmond and Kingston fully underground, connecting several London Underground and National Rail lines, including the forthcoming Crossrail (Elizabeth Line) at Ealing Broadway.  The proposal envisaged an underground driverless light rail train system similar to the Docklands Light Railway, and updated ""to the most modern standards"". The transit time from Brent Cross to Surbiton was quoted as 28 minutes, with a maximum train speed of .  The promoters cited a number of reasons why they believed an underground scheme would be cost-effective at £1.75 billion: with lower tunnelling costs as the tunnel diameter would be smaller than for a heavy rail scheme; there are no other rail tunnels to avoid (as in central London); and the subsoil strata are suitable for modern tunnel boring machines.  An unrelated scheme of the same name was previously proposed in June 2008 by the West London Business group. That proposal involved the construction of a new underground line across West and South West London and did not progress beyond concept stage.  Additionally, Regional Eurostar proposals meant to send trains from Eurostar lines into Waterloo International station to London Heathrow Airport used parts of the orbital between Willesden Junction and Acton.  Alternative orbital schemes A number of other notable orbital rail schemes for London have been previously proposed: R25 railway orbital around the Zone 3 area of London. First proposed in the Mayor of London's £1.3trn London Infrastructure 2050 plan, the line would use some existing National Rail and London Overground lines, linked by stretches of new railway.  Orbirail was a 2012 proposal for an outer ""super loop"" service roughy equivalent to a M25 for rail. The West London Orbital proposal makes use of some elements of this concept.   The Park Royal Partnership promoted a 'FastBus' scheme of branded, limited-stop buses, between  and  stations and possibly beyond.   The 'North and West London Light Railway' (or the 'Brent Cross Railway') is a proposed rapid transit network. The scheme was originally developed by the London group of the Campaign for Better Transport, and mainly uses existing or abandoned surface railway corridors.

The group was formed by former slaves who had escaped from their masters or been freed after the Civil War; they also included free blacks living near the border between Kentucky and Tennessee. In 1866, the organization began recruiting members among newly emancipated African Americans across southern West Virginia.  They recruited men willing to risk death rather than return to bondage.   In 1867,  the  recruits numbered more than 200.    By 1868,   the number reached 400.   Many of these new recruits came from northern states where there were few opportunities available to them because of racial discrimination.   Some joined up simply out of curiosity about what it would be like to live without white supervision.   Others wanted revenge on those responsible for enslaving them; some even hoped to find land grants promised to Union Army soldiers fighting alongside Confederate troops at Gettysburg.  King's Warriors operated primarily along the Ohio River Valley but also raided slaveholders’ homes throughout southwestern Virginia and eastern Kentucky.   Their attacks caused panic amongst plantation owners and local authorities alike.   On May 16, 1869, the group attacked the home of Colonel James Huston, killing him and his wife while taking several others hostage including children aged three months old through twelve years old.   After holding the hostages overnight, the warriors released most of them unharmed except for four young girls whom they sold into slavery.   On June 15, 1870, the group killed another prominent planter named Captain William McNairy when he refused to surrender his family to the guerrillas' custody.

Automatic weather station,"An automatic weather station (AWS) is an automated version of the traditional weather station, either to save human labour or to enable measurements from remote areas. An AWS will typically consist of a weather-proof enclosure containing the data logger, rechargeable battery, telemetry (optional) and the meteorological sensors with an attached solar panel or wind turbine and mounted upon a mast. The specific configuration may vary due to the purpose of the system. The system may report in near real time via the Argos System and the Global Telecommunications System, or save the data for later recovery.   In the past, automatic weather stations were often placed where electricity and communication lines were available. Nowadays, the solar panel, wind turbine and mobile phone technology have made it possible to have wireless stations that are not connected to the electrical grid or hardline telecommunications network.  Sensors  Most automatic weather stations have  Thermometer for measuring temperature  Anemometer for measuring wind speed  Wind vane for measuring wind direction  Hygrometer for measuring humidity  Barometer for measuring atmospheric pressure  Some stations can also have  Ceilometer for measuring cloud height  Present weather sensor and/or visibility sensor   Rain gauge for measuring liquid-equivalent precipitation  Ultrasonic snow depth sensor for measuring depth of snow  Pyranometer for measuring solar radiation  Unlike manual weather stations, automated airport weather stations cannot report the class and amount of clouds. Also, precipitation measurements are difficult, especially for snow, as the gauge must empty itself between observations. For present weather, all phenomena that do not touch the sensor, such as fog patches, remain unobserved. The change from manual observations to automatic weather stations is a major non-climatic change in the climate record. The change in instrumentation, enclosure and location can lead to a jump in, for example, the measured temperature or precipitation values, which can lead to erroneous estimates of climate trends. This change, and related non-climatic changes, have to be removed by homogenization.  Data-logger  The data-logger is the heart of the Automatic Weather Station. In high quality weather stations, the data-logger may be designed by the supplier to be the perfect solution for a particular meteorological client. Indeed, usually data-loggers found in the market don't fit the requirement in terms of power consumption, inputs, communication, protection against animals (ants, rats, etc.),  humidity, salty air, sand, etc. The main functions of a data-logger are:  Measurement: the data-logger collects the information from every sensor and archives it.  Calculation: the data-logger processes most of the meteorological data for the users (avg, min, max...).  Data storage: the data-logger saves all the data either on its own memory or on uSD memory card.  Power supply: the data-logger manages the power supply of the Automatic Weather Station, using a solar panel for instance.  Communication: the data-logger manages the communication protocols with the remote server. The different communication protocols are usually GSM, GPRS, RTC, WiFi, uSD, and RS232.  Enclosures  Enclosures used with automatic weather stations are typically weather proof fiberglass, ABS or stainless steel, With ABS being the cheapest, cast aluminium paint or stainless steel the most durable and fiberglass being a compromise.  Power supply The main power source for an automatic weather station depends on its usage.  Many stations with lower power equipment usually use one or more solar panels connected in parallel with a regulator and one or more rechargeable batteries. As a rule of thumb, solar output is at its optimum for only 5 hours each day. As such, mounting angle and position are vital. In the Northern Hemisphere, the solar panel would be mounted facing south and vice versa for the Southern Hemisphere. The output from the solar panels may be supplemented by a wind turbine to provide power during periods of poor sunlight, or by direct connection to the local electrical grid.  Most automated airport weather stations are connected to the commercial power grid due to the higher power needs of the ceilometer and present weather sensors, which are active sensors and emit energy directly into the environment.  Mast  The standard mast heights used with automatic weather stations are 2, 3, 10 and 30 meters. Other sizes are available, but typically these sizes have been used as standards for differing applications. The 2 meter (6.6 feet) mast is used for the measurement of parameters that affect a human subject. The mast height is referenced to head height. The 3 meter (9.8 feet) mast is used for the measurement of parameters that affect crops (such as wheat, sugar cane etc.) The mast height is referenced to crop top. The 10 meter (32.8 feet) mast is used for the measurement of parameters without interference from objects such as trees, buildings or other obstructions. Typically the most important weather parameter measured at this height is wind speed and direction. The 30 meter (98.4 feet) mast is used for the measurement of parameters over stratified distances for the purposes of data modelling. A common application is to take measurements of wind, humidity and temperature at 30, 10, and 2 meters. Other sensors are mounted around the 2 meter or lower height.

Benjamin F. Tracy,"Benjamin Franklin Tracy (April 26, 1830August 6, 1915) was a United States political figure who served as Secretary of the Navy from 1889 through 1893, during the administration of U.S. President Benjamin Harrison.  Biography He was born in the hamlet of Apalachin located in the Town of Owego, New York on April 26, 1830.  Tracy was a lawyer active in Republican Party politics during the 1850s. He was a member of the New York State Assembly (Tioga Co.) in 1862.  He served in the Union Army during the Civil War, and commanded the 109th New York Infantry Regiment. At the Battle of the Wilderness in May, 1864, he was able to rally his men and hold the Union line. For his actions he subsequently was awarded the Medal of Honor. His citation reads: Tracy ""seized the colors and led the regiment when other regiments had retired and then reformed his line and held it."" Later that year, he became commandant of the Elmira prisoner of war camp, before being appointed Colonel of the 127th Infantry, U.S. Colored Troops, on August 23, 1864. Tracy was discharged from the volunteer service on June 13, 1865. On January 18, 1867, President Andrew Johnson nominated Tracy for appointment to the brevet grade of brigadier general of volunteers, to rank from March 13, 1865, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on February 21, 1867.  He resumed the practice of law after the war, and became active in New York state politics. He was United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York from 1866 to 1877. In December 1881, he was appointed by Governor Alonzo B. Cornell to the New York Court of Appeals to fill the vacancy caused by the appointment of Judge Charles Andrews as Chief Judge after the resignation of Charles J. Folger. Tracy remained on the bench until the end of 1882 when Andrews resumed his seat after being defeated by William C. Ruger in the election for Chief Judge.  In 1875, Tracy defended the well-known preacher Henry Ward Beecher during his highly publicized trial for adultery.  Tracy was noted for his role in the creation of the ""New Navy"", a major reform of the service, which had fallen into obsolescence after the Civil War.  Like President Harrison, he supported a naval strategy focused more on offense, rather than on coastal defense and commerce raiding.  A major ally in this effort was naval theorist Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan, who had served as a professor at the new Naval War College (founded 1884).  In 1890, Mahan published his major work, The Influence of Sea Power upon History, 1660–1783—a book that achieved an international readership.  Drawing on historical examples, Mahan supported the construction of a ""blue-water Navy"" that could do battle on the high seas.  Tracy also supported the construction of modern warships. On June 30, 1890, Congress passed the Naval Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1891 (also known as the Battleship Act of 1890), a measure which authorized the construction of three battleships. The first three were later named , , and . The battleship  was authorized two years later.  Tracy's wife and child died in a fire at their residence in Washington, DC in 1890.  In the 1896 presidential election, Tracy was a presidential elector for William McKinley and Garret Hobart.  After leaving the Navy Department, Tracy again took up his legal practice. In 1896 he defended New York City Police commissioner Andrew Parker from accusations of negligence and incompetence by fellow commissioner Theodore Roosevelt in a performance that significantly embarrassed Roosevelt. He also helped end the Venezuela Crisis of 1895 by assisting Venezuela in negotiating a settlement to their boundary dispute with Great Britain.  Tracy was the Republican candidate to be the first Mayor of Greater New York City when the five boroughs consolidated in 1898. He came in third behind Democrat Robert A. Van Wyck and Seth Low of the Citizens' Union, winning 101,863 of the 523,560 votes cast in the election of 1897.  Tracy was the president of the New York State Agricultural Society in 1897 and 1898, during which time he invited Van Wyck to attend the society's annual fair.  On April 3, 1900, seven men from the International Banking and Trust Company were elected as directors of the North American Trust Company. They included president Oakleigh Thorne of the International, as well as Tracy.  Family and death Tracy died at his farm in Tioga County, New York on August 6, 1915 at 3:30 am at the home of his daughter.

Person to Person,"Person to Person is a popular television program in the United States that originally ran from 1953 to 1961, with two episodes of an attempted revival airing in 2012. Edward R. Murrow hosted the original series from its inception in 1953 until 1959, interviewing celebrities in their homes from a comfortable chair in his New York studio (his opening: ""Good evening, I'm Ed Murrow. And the name of the program is 'Person to Person'. It's all live – there's no film""). In the last two years of its original run, Charles Collingwood was the host.  Although Murrow is best remembered as a reporter on programs such as Hear It Now and See It Now and for publicly confronting Senator Joseph McCarthy, on Person to Person he was a pioneer of the celebrity interview.  The program was well planned but not strictly scripted, with as many as six cameras and TV lighting installed to cover the guest's moves through his home, and a microwave link to transmit the signals back to the network. The guests wore wireless microphones to pick up their voices as they moved around the home or its grounds. The interviews were done live. The two 15-minute interviews in each program were typically with very different types of people, such as a movie star and a scientist. Guests often used the appearance to promote their latest project or book.  Guests The first guest was Roy Campanella who had just hit a Home run to win Game 3 for the Brooklyn Dodgers against the New York Yankees in the 1953 World Series. He later appeared in a wheelchair in 1959 following his automobile accident.  The long list of guests included then-Senator John F. Kennedy and his wife Jacqueline, Elizabeth Taylor, Andy Williams (1960), Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, Mae West, Jerry Lewis, Marlon Brando, Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, Liberace, Ethel Waters, Sammy Davis Jr., Groucho and Harpo Marx, Margaret Mead, Harry Truman, Marilyn Monroe, W.C. Handy, Duke Ellington, Tallulah Bankhead, Noël Coward, Ethel Merman, Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh, Fidel Castro, Bing Crosby, Julie Newmar, Leopold Stokowski, Kirk Douglas and John Steinbeck.  The show featuring Bing Crosby and Mary Margaret McBride in December 1953 was the first time the show appeared in the Top 10 TV shows as measured by Trendex. The highest-rated featured Elizabeth Taylor, Mike Todd and Mark Van Doren with a 35 Trendex.  Revivals On December 15, 2011, CBS News announced they would bring back the news series with Charlie Rose and Lara Logan as hosts.   The network announced plans for two separately-scheduled episodes, based on pre-taped rather than live interviews.   According to Susan Zirinsky, an executive producer of the new show and of 48 Hours, they ""tried to stay true to Edward R. Murrow's concept.  The two reporters remain in New York, and we are taken in by the artist or the newsmaker into a special place.  There's an intimacy when someone allows you into their home.""  The first episode, airing on February 8, 2012, featured interviews with George Clooney, Jon Bon Jovi, and Warren Buffett.  The premiere attracted 5.9 million viewers, less than a third of the viewers watching American Idol and fewer than the 8.44 million who watched The Middle; it outrated One Tree Hill and Whitney, though the latter attracted a larger share of the 18–49 audience.  Had the two specially-scheduled episodes been well-received, Person to Person could have become a regularly scheduled series. The second episode aired on November 23, 2012 (Black Friday), featuring Sean Penn, Alicia Keys and Drew Brees.  In the rebranding of CBSN into CBS News in 2022, a second revival was announced to run on the service and be hosted by Norah O'Donnell.

Pokémon the Movie: Secrets of the Jungle,"Pokémon the Movie: Secrets of the Jungle is a 2020 Japanese anime film based on Satoshi Tajiri's Pokémon media franchise and produced by OLM. It is the twenty-third film in the Pokémon universe, covering Generation VIII. The film returns to the series’ traditional 2D art style rather than using the CGI animation used in Mewtwo Strikes Back: Evolution. It features the new Generation VIII Mythical Pokémon Zarude and a shiny Celebi.  In Japan, the film was released on December 25, 2020, by Toho. The original release date of July 10, 2020, was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. The film released worldwide (excluding Japan, Korea, and China) on Netflix on October 8, 2021.  For a limited time, if players of Pokémon Sword and Shield preordered tickets for this film's premiere, they would get the Mythical Pokémon Zarude in its ""Dada"" form and a Shiny Celebi.  Plot In the Forest of Okoya, the Mythical Pokémon Zarude finds an infant boy in a cradle washed up on a riverbank. Unable to leave the child on his own, Zarude adopts him as a son, giving him the name ""Koko"". Zarude leaves his tribe, which inhabits a Great Tree deep in the jungle where humans are forbidden to venture, to raise Koko who grows up as a feral child.  Ten years later, Ash Ketchum and Pikachu visit the Forest of Okoya from nearby Milyfa Town. While attempting to capture a wild Cramorant, Ash and Pikachu encounter a research team from the Biotope Company, a scientific organization studying the jungle. Team Rocket, covertly following them, look up information on the Biotope Company and its leader Dr. Zed, and decide to infiltrate the group.  Later, Ash sees Koko go over a waterfall, after he got knocked out from a pipe while swinging on a vine with a wild Skwovet, and retrieves him from the water, bringing him to Milyfa Town's Pokémon Center for treatment. When Koko awakens, he becomes alarmed and escapes the building, having never seen other humans before. Discovering that Koko believes himself to be a Pokémon, Ash and Pikachu spend time with him in the town, helping him to learn about humans for the first time.  Ash, Pikachu and Koko later encounter Zarude, who is forced to admit the truth about Koko's heritage. Zarude brings them to an abandoned laboratory he found shortly after adopting Koko, where he shows them a photograph he found of an infant Koko with his human parents. Zarude then leaves, returning to the Great Tree alone.  Discovering a wallet from Biotope Company, Ash brings Koko to their headquarters, where they meet with Dr. Zed. He reveals that Koko's parents are Chrom and Phossa Molybden, a pair of scientists who led the organization in researching the healing springs, and that Koko's real name is Al Molybden. However, Chrom and Phossa were killed in a car accident ten years ago, which was presumed to have killed Al as well. Dr. Zed scans Koko's pendant and discovers partially corrupted data on it that reveals an image of the Great Tree. Distraught over the news of his parents' fate, Koko flees to the Great Tree as well.  As soon as he reaches the Great Tree, Koko discovers a tracking chip planted on him by Dr. Zed. Zed arrives with his research team, which Team Rocket have infiltrated, along with a giant, spider-like tank. Koko and Ash try to stop Zed's actions, but he restrains them using his Ariados and throws them into the back of one of his trucks. He then fires missiles at the Great Tree, blasting open holes from which the spring water gushes forth. Ash, Pikachu and Koko escape with unwitting help from Team Rocket as they wrestle with the Cramorant from earlier and confront Dr. Zed, who suffers a psychotic breakdown and admits that, when Chrom and Phossa Molybden discovered the Great Tree's location but refused to continue researching it out of respect for the Zarude tribe, he killed the couple by running them off a road and stealing their supply of the spring water before leaving them to die in the explosion of their wrecked car. Before they perished, Chrom and Phossa sent the infant Al down the river with a drive containing the rest of their research, leading to Zarude finding him.  Dr. Zed seizes control of the tank from his henchmen, and Ash, Pikachu and Koko try to fight him to no avail. Zarude's tribe arrives, having been convinced to help save the jungle by Zarude who raised Koko. Koko's father figure also brings a group of wild Pokémon, who previously disliked his tribe due to their selfish behavior, to assist. Zarude is injured in the battle and nearly succumbs, but Koko manages to harness the power of the jungle as if he were indeed a Pokémon, healing him. With all their combined forces, they manage to break the tank's power source, disabling it. Zed attempts to escape, but is captured by Koko.  In the aftermath, the humans and Pokémon work together to restore the damage done to the jungle. Dr. Zed is arrested for his crimes and is loaded into a police van by Officer Jenny, based on evidence leaked by Team Rocket. Koko decides to leave to explore the human world and become the bridge between humans and Pokémon, taking the photograph of his parents along with him. As he and Ash leave the Forest of Okoya, they see Zarude turn the healing springs into a geyser to send Koko off.

BiTrektual,"BiTrektual is the ninth studio album by Cuban American dark cabaret singer Aurelio Voltaire, released on September 2, 2012. It is a concept album containing songs parodying the Star Wars and Star Trek franchises – Voltaire is a fan of both. It also contains a Doctor Who-related song, ""It's Bigger on the Inside"". The album's title is intended to be a pun on the word ""bisexual"".  ""The Trouble with Tribbles"" excepted, all the Star Trek-related songs were previously featured on Voltaire's currently out-of-print 2001 EP Banned on Vulcan; they were all re-recorded for this release. A re-recorded, extended version of ""Cantina"", a song previously featured on his 2007 album Ooky Spooky, is also present. ""Poopin' on the Enterprise"", ""Yoda"" and ""Damn You, George Lucas!"" are not songs, but rather spoken-word monologues by Voltaire originally included on his 2006 live album Live!. ""Screw the Ocampa"" is a parody of the Bahamian folk song ""The John B. Sails"", with lyrics heavily modified by Voltaire.  Robert Picardo, Garrett Wang and Tim Russ, all actors of Star Trek fame, and Jason C. Miller as well, provide additional vocals for some of the tracks.  Voltaire also made a contest on which fans would design the BiTrektual logo and cover art; the winner was eventually revealed to be artist Shamine King.  The cover features Voltaire dressed like Obi-Wan Kenobi kissing Hikaru Sulu.

Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer,"Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) is a discontinued software tool which is no longer available from Microsoft that determines security state by assessing missing security updates and less-secure security settings within Microsoft Windows, Windows components such as Internet Explorer, IIS web server, and products Microsoft SQL Server, and Microsoft Office macro settings. Security updates are determined by the current version of MBSA using the Windows Update Agent present on Windows computers since Windows 2000 Service Pack 3.  The less-secure settings, often called Vulnerability Assessment (VA) checks, are assessed based on a hard-coded set of registry and file checks. An example of a VA might be that permissions for one of the directories in the /www/root folder of IIS could be set at too low a level, allowing unwanted modification of files from outsiders.  Version history Versions 1.2.1 and below run on NT4, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003, provide support for IIS versions 5 through 6, SQL Server 7 and 2000, Internet Explorer 5.01 and 6.0 only, and Microsoft Office 2000 through 2003. Security update assessment is provided by an integrated version of Shavlik's HFNetChk 3.8 scan tool.  MBSA 1.2.1 was localized into English, German, French and Japanese versions and supported security assessment for any locale.  Version 2.0 retained the hard-coded VA checks, but replaced the Shavlik security assessment engine with Microsoft Update technologies which adds dynamic support for all Microsoft products supported by Microsoft Update. MBSA 2.0.1 was released to support the revised Windows Update (WU) offline scan file (WSUSSCN2.CAB). MBSA 2.1 added Vista and Windows Server 2008 support, a new Vista-styled GUI interface, support for the latest Windows Update Agent (3.0), a new Remote Directory (/rd) feature and extended the VA checks to x64 platforms.  In the August 2012 Security Bulletin Webcast Q&A on Technet it was announced that ""The current version of MBSA (2.2) will not support Windows 8 and Microsoft currently has no plans to release an updated version of the tool.""  In November 2013 MBSA 2.3 was released. This release adds support for Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2. Windows 2000 will no longer be supported with this release.  Microsoft support and updates for MBSA has ended. The current version 2.3 does not offer official support for Windows 10 or Windows Server 2016. The Microsoft MBSA webpage has been removed.

Dawachi,"Dawachi (; ; died 1759) was the last khan of the Dzungar Khanate from 1753 until his defeat at the hands of Qing and Mongol forces at Ili in 1755.  Dawachi belonged to the highest rank of Dzungar aristocracy. He traced his ancestry back directly to Erdeni Batur (died 1635), the founder of the Dzungar Khanate. His grandfather was Tsering Dondup. His brother, Tsewang Rabtan (1643-1727), led the Dzungar invasion and occupation of Tibet in 1717. His father was the second cousin of Galdan Tseren, the Khong Tayiji of the Dzungar Khanate from 1727 to 1745.  Background Dawachi, whose pasture lands were centered in the Tarbagatai region first came to prominence when he and his Khoit-Oirat ally Amursana opposed the rule of Lama Dorji (1728-1753), who had seized the Dzungar throne after assassinating his brother Tsewang Dorji Namjal in 1750. The reign of Lama Dorji's father, Galdan Tseren, represented a resurgence of the Dzungar Khanate's political, military and economic influence in central Asia after the defeats of Galdan Boshugtu Khan's forces by the Qing army fifty years earlier. However, when Galdan Tseren died in 1745, his three sons battled over succession. The political anarchy that ensued all but eliminated the gains made under Galdan Tseren. In 1751, Lama Dorji's pre-emptive military strike defeated forces loyal to Dawachi, who was forced to flee across the border into Kazakh Khanate territory. With a thousand of his men, he and Amursana marched to Ili where they surprised Lama Dorji and killed him on 13 January 1753. Other sources claim that Lama Dorji was killed by his own troops in December 1752.  Dawachi seizes power  Following the death of Lama Dorji, Dawachi claimed the title taisha of the Dzungars based on his aristocratic lineage. Amursana, although a prince, was of considerably simpler descent and was of Khoit rather than Dzungar origin. Nevertheless, Amursana, who had married the daughter of Ablai Khan, leader of the neighboring Kazakh Khanate, and had negotiated the support of various Oirat clan leaders, called on Dawachi to divide the Khanate's lands between them as Amursana said he was promised. Dawachi refused and instead attacked Amursana in 1754, forcing him to flee east to Khovd where he swore allegiance to the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing Empire. The Qianlong Emperor agreed to support Amursana's plans to defeat Dawachi, which included the retaking of Ili and neighboring Kashgar. Meanwhile, most of the Oirat Khoshut had followed Amursana and had defected to the Qing, leaving Dawachi with only the Dzungars under his control.  The Ili Campaign  Late 1754 and early 1755, in an attempt to definitively settle the 60-year-old Dzungaria problem, the Qianlong Emperor gave orders for a final advance on Ili. Approximately 200,000 soldiers were mobilized for a campaign against Dawachi. Many were Khalkha Mongols, who contributed tens of thousands of horses and mules to the effort. Amursana was made Border Pacification Vice-general of the Left of the Northern Route Army. General Ban Di took supreme command of the army, which set out from Uliastai in March 1755 and linked up with the Western Route Army under Yong Chang and Salar (薩喇勒) three months later. The combined forces reached Bortala in June 1755. Militarily, the campaign was much more successful than expected. There were mass desertions among Dawachi's forces when they learned that Amursana was part of the approaching army. In desperation, Dawachi sent a delegation to Beijing led by his son, who expressed his father's desire to become a vassal of the Qing Empire. The Qing army did not respond and continued the campaign.  After several skirmishes and small scale battles along the Ili River, the Qing army led by Zhaohui approached Ili and forced Dawachi to withdraw south west to the Gedeng Mountains where he made a last stand with his remaining 10,000 men. Dawachi's army was routed and Dawachi himself was captured by Hakim Beg Hojis who sent him on to Beijing. There, the Qianlong Emperor showed leniency, granting Dawachi a princely title and permitting him to marry a princess from the Qing imperial family. The last years of Dawachi's life were spent in Kalgan where, in 1759, he died from excessive alcohol consumption.

On January 9, 2009, Collie announced in a press conference that he would forgo his senior year and enter the 2009 NFL Draft. The Indianapolis Colts drafted him in the fourth round, 127th overall.  Professional career  Indianapolis Colts Collie impressed Indianapolis Colts Head Coach Jim Caldwell in the preseason and was placed third on the depth chart at the wide receiver position for the 2009 season, placing ahead of Pierre Garçon for the slot receiver position. However, Garçon soon jumped Collie on the depth chart shortly thereafter. Collie finished his rookie season in the NFL among the top statistical leaders for all rookies at the wide receiver position.  Collie started his second year strong, making numerous touchdown catches and establishing himself as Peyton Manning's ""go-to guy"" after Dallas Clark suffered a season-ending injury. However, on November 7, 2010, Collie was involved in a collision against the Philadelphia Eagles, in which he was hit on both sides of his head by Quintin Mikell and Kurt Coleman. Collie was taken off the field on a stretcher. According to a televised ESPN update, Collie was seen sitting up and moving after several minutes working with medics. Collie suffered a concussion as a result of the collision. Coleman was penalized for unnecessary roughness for the hit on Collie, but neither player was fined, as the NFL later ruled that the contact that caused the injury was incidental as a result of Mikell's initial hit. On December 19, 2010, Collie was hit in the head by Jaguars linebacker Daryl Smith and was down for several minutes. It was his second concussion-related injury that year and ultimately ended his 2010 season. Despite the fact that no fines were assessed, the highly visible injuries to Collie have added to the debate about violent hits in football. On December 22, 2010, Collie was placed on injured reserve.  Collie played in all 16 games, making 5 starts, during the 2011 regular season, but managed to only catch one touchdown pass among his 54 receptions.  During a 2012 preseason game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Collie suffered his third concussion of his career. During the third game of the 2012 season against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Collie suffered a ruptured patellar tendon in his right knee, causing him to miss the rest of the 2012 season.  On February 15, 2013, Collie was told he would not be re-signed by the Colts.  San Francisco 49ers On August 2, 2013, the San Francisco 49ers signed Collie to a 1-year contract. He was released on August 31, 2013, during final roster cuts.  New England Patriots The New England Patriots signed Collie as a free agent on October 3, 2013. He was signed for a one-year, veteran-minimum contract, which is $715,000 but prorated to $546,765. Due to Collie's previous injuries, the contract included an injury waiver, meaning the Patriots could release him if he was injured and only owe him a ""split"" (50%) of the contract. He was released November 5, 2013 because of a knee injury, after only 3 catches for 34 yards. He was re-signed by the Patriots on December 5, 2013 to add depth with rookie wideouts Aaron Dobson and Kenbrell Thompkins dealing with nagging injuries. He was released once more on December 27, 2013, only to be re-signed on January 2, 2014. The Patriots released Collie again after the playoffs.  BC Lions On January 29, 2015, the BC Lions of the Canadian Football League announced they had signed Collie to a contract. In his only CFL season, Collie played in 16 games, catching 43 passes for 439 yards with 7 touchdowns. Collie also recorded a touchdown as a passer, throwing a 21-yard score to quarterback Jonathon Jennings on a trick play.   On April 8, 2016, Collie announced his retirement from professional football.

Colombian spider monkey,"The Colombian spider monkey (Ateles fusciceps rufiventris), is a subspecies of the Black-headed spider monkey, a type of New World monkey, found in Colombia and Panama.  Some authorities, such as Froelich (1991), Collins and Dubach (2001) and Nieves (2005), do not recognize the Black-headed spider monkey as a distinct species and so treat the Colombian spider monkey as a subspecies of Geoffroy's spider monkey.  The Colombian spider monkey lives in dry forests, humid forests and cloud forests, and can live up to  above sea level. It is entirely black with some white on its chin while the Brown-headed spider monkey (A. f. fusciceps) has a black or brown body and a brown head.  The spider monkey has a black body and long limbs with thumb-less hands.  It has a prehensile and extremely flexible tail, which acts as an extra limb.  The tail has a hairless patch on the tip that is used for grip.  This hairless patch is unique in its markings, just like the human fingerprint.  Colombian spider monkeys can weigh up to 9.1 kg (20 pounds).  Fruit makes up eighty percent of the spider monkey's diet, which also includes leaves, nuts, seeds, bark, insects, and flowers. Spider monkeys contribute to the dispersion of undigested seeds from the fruits they eat. This monkey lives approximately 24 years.  Spider monkeys are found in social groups of up to 30 individuals; however, they are usually broken up into smaller foraging groups of 3-4 individuals.  They move and climb through the forest by hand over hand (brachiation) motion.

Princess Euncheon,"Princess Euncheon of the Im clan () or Princess Sagi () was a Korean Royal Consort and the 4th wife of King Chunghye of Goryeo. She was also known as Princess Oji ().  Biography  Early life and background The future Princess Euncheon was born as the daughter of merchant Im-Sin (임신) who served Grand Prince Danyang, a grandson of Chungnyeol of Goryeo. While she and her father made their living by selling porcelain vessels, she then was found and favored not long after that by King Chunghye, also become his concubine and most favourite wife.  Palace life In 1340, Im then entered the palace by Chunghye's order and become Palace Lady Im (궁인 임씨, 宮人 林氏) and two years later, in February, Lady Hong was chosen as became Chunghye's 3rd wife and given a royal title. Seeing about this, Im was jealous and tried to stop it, but for comforted her, the King then trusted the royal title Princess Euncheon (은천옹주, 銀川翁主) to her. However, peoples recently called Im as Princess Sagi (사기옹주, 沙器翁主) which came from she whom selling a porcelain vessels (사기, 沙器) and Princess Oji (오지옹주).  It was said that King Chunghye usually took an energized drug called Yeoryak (열약) and after contracted the effects while he still a Crown Prince in the Yuan Dynasty, he then transmitted this to the women with whom they had a night together.

Haj Ali Razmara,"Ali Razmara, also known as Haj Ali Razmara (; 30 March 1901 – 7 March 1951), was a military leader and prime minister of Iran.  He was assassinated by 26-year-old Khalil Tahmassebi of the Fadayan-e Islam organization outside the Shah Mosque in Tehran at the age of 49. Razmara was the third Iranian prime minister to be assassinated.  Early life and education Razmara (an adopted name loosely translated as ""war planner"" or more accurately ""battle organizer"") was born in Tehran and studied at the military academy of Saint-Cyr in France.  Career  Razmara was appointed prime minister by the Shah in 1950. He promoted a plan for decentralization of government together with decentralization of the seven-year plan for infrastructure development and improvement. His idea was to bring government to the people; an unheard-of idea in Iran. His plan called for setting up local councils in Iran's 84 districts to run local affairs such as health, education and agricultural programs. One of his most enduring achievements was the institution of the Point IV program via agreement with US President Harry Truman.  Razmara began trimming the government payrolls, eliminating a large number of officials out of a total of 187,000 civil servants. At one stroke he terminated nearly 400 high-placed officials. By so doing, Razmarra earned the wrath of the powerful land-owning and merchant families and most conservatives without gaining the confidence of the radical Tudeh Party. Additionally, his opposition to the expropriation of AIOC assets at Abadan earned him the wrath of the small but powerful group of Majlis deputies known as the National Front. The National Front was led by Majlis Member, Mohammed Mossadegh, whose leading ally in Parliament was the Assembly Speaker, Ayatollah Kashani.  Anglo-Iranian oil negotiations Ali Razmara came closer than any other prime minister to ratifying the supplemental oil agreement between Iran and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC).  The agreement drew the ire of most Iranians and Majlis of Iran deputies because it provided far less favorable terms than the Venezuela agreement between Standard Oil of New Jersey and the Venezuelan government, or the agreement between the Arabian-American Oil Company and the Saudi Arabian government. In addition, it gave continuous control of Iran's oil industry to a foreign company and country; the living and working conditions of its Iranian workers were extremely poor; it refused to allow Iranians a greater voice in the company's management; and it denied them the right to audit the company's books. The AIOC did, however, offer a few improvements: it guaranteed that its annual royalty payments would not drop below 4 million pounds; it would reduce the area where it would be allowed to drill; and it promised to train more Iranians for administrative jobs. Razmara asked Anglo-Iranian to revise some of the agreement terms, namely to allow Iranian auditors to review their financial activities, offer Iranians managerial jobs, and pay some of the royalties to the Iranian government in advance.  The British refused and lost the opportunity.  Razmara was in office at the direct urging of the British Foreign Office and the AIOC to the Shah. They wanted a stronger figure than Razmara's predecessor, Prime Minister Mansur, to ensure the success of the Supplemental Agreement.  ""Only a man with [Razmara's] fierce determination, they believed, would be strong enough to face down Mossadegh and the National Front.""  Assassination On 7 March 1951, Razmara went to the Shah Mosque for a memorial service. The police opened a corridor through the inner courtyard for him. The assassin, in the crowd, fired three quick shots, fatally wounding the Prime Minister. Khalil Tahmassebi, a member of the group Fadayan-e Islam, was arrested at the scene.  At a public demonstration the following day attended by more than 8,000 Tudeh Party members and National Front supporters, Fadayan-e Islam distributed leaflets carrying a threat to assassinate the Shah and other government officials if the assassin, Tahmassebi, was not set free immediately. Threats were also issued against any Majlis member who opposed oil nationalization.  The National Front was led by Mohammed Mossadegh, who became prime minister within two months of Razmara's assassination. Ayatollah Seyid Abol Ghasim Kashani, the leader of the country's mullahs, ended his support for the Fadayan-e Islam after the assassination. Kashani then became closer to the National Front. On the other hand, the assassin, Tahmassebi, was freed by the Iranian Parliament in 1952, but then he was tried and executed in 1955.  In 1954 Navab Safavi, founder of the Fadayan-e Islam, in a speech to the Muslim Brotherhood meeting in Egypt, declared that he himself had killed Razmara.  Effects on Iranian government  On 12 March 1951 the Majlis voted to nationalize Iran's oil. Not one Majlis member voted against the Act. A spectator in the gallery is reported to have shouted ""Eight grains of gunpowder have brought this about."" This was followed by a vote on 28 March to expropriate the AIOC properties at Abadan.  The Shah appointed Hussein Ala to succeed Razmara as prime minister. This move was met by further assassinations, riots, and demonstrations throughout the country. Ala ultimately resigned his post as prime minister. The Shah opted to go with former Prime Minister Sayyid Ziya al-Din Tabatabai but the Majlis, led by the National Front, voted Mohammed Mossadegh to the post.  The nationalization of the oil industry was supported by the vast majority of the Iranian public, who believed it would lead to prosperity for all. After a series of further assassinations of several more government ministers by their then ally Fadā'iyān-e Islam, Prime Minister Mossadegh and the National Front were finally able to nationalize the oil and expel the AIOC. As this move dealt a severe blow to the monarchy as well as to British interests in Iran, the US and Britain orchestrated the now well-known coup d'état in 1953, code-named Operation Ajax, removing Mossadegh as Prime Minister and convincing the Shah to appoint a Prime Minister of their choosing. Mohammad Reza Shah remained in power until the 1979 revolution, which led to the establishment of the Islamic Republic.

Cristallo,"Cristallo is a glass which is totally clear (like rock crystal), without the slight yellow or greenish color originating from iron oxide impurities. This effect is achieved through small additions of manganese oxide. Often Cristallo has a low lime content which makes it prone to glass corrosion (otherwise known as glass disease).  The invention of Cristallo glass is attributed to Angelo Barovier around 1450.  Materials  In addition to common glass making materials manganese, quartz pebbles, and alume catino, a particularly suitable form of soda ash, are used in the making of cristallo glass.  Rather than using common sand, crushed quartz pebbles were used instead. The quartz pebbles were typically from the Ticino and the Adige rivers. The quartz pebbles went through a rigorous screening process before being selected for use in cristallo production. The quartz pebbles had to be free of yellow and black veins and also had to be able to produce sparks when struck with steel.  If the quartz pebbles passed the selection process then the pebbles were heated to the point where the stones began to glow and then placed into cold water. Then the pebbles were crushed and ground.  The typical flux used in the production of cristallo was called alume catino. Alume catino was derived from the ash of the salsola soda and salsola kali bushes that grew in the Levantine coastal region. It was found to contain high and constant amounts of sodium and calcium carbonates, necessary to make workable and chemically stable glass.  The ash of the plants was carefully sieved and then placed into water to be gently boiled with constant mixing. Then the ashen mixture was placed into shallow pans to be dried. The alume catino would repeatedly undergo the boiling and drying process until all of the salt was extracted from the ashes.  Process  The crushed and ground quartz was mixed with the purified alume catino and constantly mixed at high temperatures. The top of the molten batch would then be skimmed off. By skimming the top of the molten glass, unreacted and undissolved chlorides and sulfates in the mixture were removed.  The molten glass would then be ladled into vats of water. The water removed chloride and sulfate impurities from the mixture. The process of remelting and placing the molten mixture into vats of water was repeated several times until the glass-makers were satisfied.  Next the glass was placed into a furnace that was heated to the highest temperature possible and left there for several days. The material was stirred continually to eliminate defects, such as bubbles.  Then the refined mixture was taken, heated and shaped into blocks called frit. The frit was then taken and remelted and skimmed once again in order to remove impurities. The batch then had manganese added to the mixture at this time. The addition of manganese helps to rid the cristallo of any color tints. This step is repeated until the glass-maker is satisfied.  Now the molten mixture is ready to be shaped by glass-makers into pieces of cristalloware.

Dirofilaria,"Dirofilaria is a filarial (arthropod-borne) nematode (roundworm), in the family Onchocercidae. Some species cause dirofilariasis, a state of parasitic infection, in humans and other animals.  There are about 27 species in the genus. These are generally divided into two subgenera, Dirofilaria and Nochtiella.  Some species are well-known parasites, including Dirofilaria immitis, the dog heartworm, Dirofilaria repens, which affects many types of nonhuman mammals, and Dirofilaria tenuis, which usually parasitizes raccoons, but can infect humans, as well.  Human dirofilariasis is generally caused by D. immitis and D. repens.  The former can cause pulmonary dirofilariasis, which may have no symptoms.  Another form of the infection can be characterized by a painful lump under the skin or infection of the eye.  The nematodes are spread by mosquitoes.  Etymology From Latin dīrus 'fearful; ominous' + fīlum 'thread', Dirofilaria is a genus of nematodes of the superfamily Filarioidea. The first known description of Dirofilaria may have been by Italian nobleman Francesco Birago in 1626 in his Treatise on Hunting: “The dog generates two worms, which are half an arm’s length long and thicker than a finger and red like fire.” Birago erroneously identified the worms as a larval stage of another parasite, Dioctophyme renale. The dog heartworm was named Filaria by American parasitologist Joseph Leidy in 1856, and the genus was renamed Dirofilaria by French parasitologists Railliet and Henry in 1911.  Taxonomy Species in the genus include:  Dirofilaria acutiuscula Dirofilaria aethiops Dirofilaria ailure Dirofilaria asymmetrica Dirofilaria cancrivori Dirofilaria conjunctivae Dirofilaria corynodes Dirofilaria desportesi Dirofilaria fausti Dirofilaria freitasi Dirofilaria genettae Dirofilaria hystrix Dirofilaria immitis – dog heartworm Dirofilaria indica Dirofilaria louisianensis Dirofilaria macacae Dirofilaria macrodemos Dirofilaria magalhaesi Dirofilaria magnilarvata Dirofilaria pongoi Dirofilaria reconditum Dirofilaria repens Dirofilaria roemeri  Dirofilaria tawila Dirofilaria tenuis Dirofilaria timidi Dirofilaria uniformis Dirofilaria ursi  References This article uses public domain text from the CDC as cited  Spirurida Secernentea genera","Dirofilaria immitis is the species of heartworm that infects dogs and cats, causing dirofilariasis or canine cardiopulmonary dirofilariosis (heartworm disease). It was first described in 1885 by Leuckart as Dirofilaria immitis; however it had been known to exist since at least 1877 when Dr. George Mellanby reported finding what he called ""larvæ"" in the lungs of two dogs from India who died after being bitten by mosquitoes. The adult worms are large filarial nematodes which live within pulmonary arteries where they feed on blood; their presence causes severe respiratory distress due to right-sided congestive heart failure caused by pressure exerted upon the lung tissue surrounding them.  The larvae develop into microfilariae which circulate freely through the dog's body until ingested by mosquitos during feeding.   Adult female worms lay eggs which hatch inside the intestines of the insect vector before migrating back to the dog via its saliva.   Once mature adults have developed, male and female worms mate and produce more eggs.",wikipedia,bigscience/bloomz,Dirofilaria,0.025477707006369428,0.3333333333333333,0.025616779850425514,0.32954545454545453,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0.03422357238075723,0.04354478972322596,0.02107823267126064,0.047285464098073555,2,0,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0

"Teodósio, Prince of Brazil","Dom Teodósio, Prince of Brazil, Duke of Braganza (Teodósio de Bragança; ; 8 February 1634 – 15 May 1653) was the heir-apparent son of John IV of Portugal (first king of the House of Braganza) and his wife Luisa de Guzmán (Luísa de Gusmão). In 1645 he was given the title of Prince of Brazil, a new crown-princely position thus created. Also, his father granted him the duchy as 10th Duke of Braganza, presumably after his uncle Duarte died in 1649.  Biography  He was born on 8 February, 1634 in Vila Viçosa and was the heir to the throne of Portugal from 1641 until his death at only 19 years of age.  When the prince was 13 years old he took part in the State Council's reunions.  Teodósio's death, on 15 May, 1653, due to tuberculosis, caused great unrest in the kingdom. His next brother, the medically and mentally problem-ridden Infante Afonso, succeeded him as Prince of Brazil, Duke of Braganza and heir-apparent of the kingdom. Due to mental incapacity and impotence, Afonso would eventually be deposed by Pedro, Duke of Beja and died childless.  Interests Teodósio was a very gifted young man. He knew Greek and Latin, was keen on philosophy and well respected amongst the great intellectuals of the time.  The Prince had a great interest in Astrology. He had a collection of charts of his family and made predictions on several political subjects. His astrological interests were encouraged and aided by his tutor, the Jesuit priest António Vieira.

He also fought at the Siege of Badajoz and at the Battle of Alcantara during the War of the Spanish Succession. He went on to be Master General of the Ordnance in Ireland.  Military career  Born the son of Charles-Louis de La Rochefoucauld, 2nd marquis of Montandre of the Doudeauville branch of the family and Madeline-Anne de La Rochefoucauld (née Pithou), de La Rochefoucauld was brought up in France as a Roman Catholic but converted to Protestantism. After arriving in England as a Huguenot refugee in the aftermath of the Edict of Fontainebleau of 1685, La Rochefoucauld joined William III's Army and served under the Earl of Galway during the Williamite War in Ireland. He was commissioned as a brevet lieutenant colonel and given command of Francis du Cambon's Regiment of Foot on 15 February 1692. He went with his regiment to the Low Countries in September 1692 during the Nine Years' War and in 1702 succeeded his brother Isaac, who died without issue, as 4th marquis de Montandre.

Break of Hearts (album),"Break of Hearts is the fifth studio album by rock band Katrina and the Waves, released in 1989 (see 1989 in music). It is their last album to reach the Billboard 200, reaching #122, and contains their last top 40 hit in the United States, ""That's the Way"", which reached #16. It was their last studio album released in the United States and the first and only release for the SBK label (the band would briefly move to Virgin Records just before it was sold to Capitol's then-owner EMI).  Background and critical reception After being dropped by Capitol Records following 1986's Waves album, Katrina and the Waves secured a new deal with SBK Records, which released the more rock-oriented Break of Hearts. Despite a US Top 20 hit with ""That's the Way"", it was their only album for the label. Singer Katrina Leskanich said on the band's website, ""SBK told us that they could see us as a stadium band, Bryan Adams style, and [guitarist Kimberley Rew] was coming up with this stuff that was perfect for rock radio."" Retrospective reviews were less than positive. Trouser Press described the album as a ""horrendously wrongheaded comeback bid that shows the Waves to be utterly oblivious to their own strengths,"" calling it ""bland, overprocessed commercial slop."" The Rolling Stone Album Guide felt that the writing was ""empty and mannered."" Rew was quoted on the website saying, ""We've never been successful enough to be immune from the influences of producers and marketing men ... the more we fell for those 80s trademarks, the more we diluted the band.""

Calgary Tigers,"The Calgary Tigers, often nicknamed the Bengals, were an ice hockey team based in Calgary, Alberta, Canada from 1920 until 1927 as members of the Big-4 League, Western Canada Hockey League and Prairie Hockey League. The Tigers were revived in 1932, playing for a short-lived four years in the North Western Hockey League. They played their games at the Victoria Arena.  Created ostensibly as an amateur team in hopes of competing for the Allan Cup, the Tigers helped form the Western Canada Hockey League in 1921 to become the first major professional team in Calgary. In 1924, after winning both the league and Western Canadian championships, the Tigers became the first Calgary based club to compete for the Stanley Cup.  After succumbing to financial pressures in 1927, the Tigers were briefly revived in the mid-1930s as a minor professional club. The Tigers competed for a total of eleven seasons in four leagues, winning four championships during their existence. Five Tigers players would later gain election to the Hockey Hall of Fame.  History  Big-4 League In 1919, under the guidance of Alberta Amateur Hockey Association league president Allan McCaw, a new elite senior amateur league was established in Alberta with two teams each in Calgary and Edmonton. The Big-4 League's intention was to compete for the Allan Cup, emblematic of Canada's national senior championship. The Tigers were created in 1920, along with the Canadians, to represent Calgary in the Big Four after the city's two original teams, the Wanderers and Columbus Crew, withdrew following the league's first season.  The Tigers also faced the Edmonton Eskimos and Dominions who served as representatives of Alberta's capital.  The Calgary teams were hosted at the Victoria Arena, which had been converted into a hockey rink in 1918.  While the Big-4 billed itself as an amateur circuit, it became known as a notorious example of a ""shamateur"" league, as amateur teams secretly employed professional players in an attempt to gain an upper hand on their competition.  When the Big Four announced their intention to compete in the Allan Cup playdowns, the Pacific Coast Hockey Association sent a letter of protest to the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association demanding that the league be declared professional, thus ineligible to compete for the Allan Cup. The Big Four ultimately chose to withdraw from the AAHA, and operated as an independent league in 1920–21.  The Tigers' inaugural game was played at home on December 29, 1920 as 2,500 fans saw them defeat the Edmonton Dominions 6–1 on the strength of a goal and two assists by Gordon Fraser.  Late in the season, the Canadians protested the use of goaltender Bill Tobin by the Edmonton Eskimos, arguing that he had not lived in Alberta long enough to be eligible per the league's residency rules. Following a last minute change of one of the arbitrators, a three-man panel denied the protest.  The decision led the front-running Tigers to refuse to play any series against the second-place Eskimos for the league championship as the team felt the Canadians' protest was improperly handled.  Efforts to reach a compromise failed as the Edmonton clubs refused to allow the protest to be reconsidered, resulting in the collapse of the league on February 24, 1921.  The Tigers remained active despite the demise of the league, playing a series of exhibition games against the Saskatoon Crescents and a team from Moose Jaw.  The Eskimos eventually agreed to face the Tigers without Tobin in an informal championship that was known as the  Intercity Championship.  The Tigers claimed the title on total-goals as they defeated Edmonton 2–0 in the first game at Calgary before dropping the second 2–1 at Edmonton.   The Tigers ended their season with a 2–0 exhibition loss to the defending Stanley Cup champion Ottawa Senators, who were touring the country as they travelled west to defend their title against the PCHA champion Vancouver Millionaires.  Western Canada Hockey League  The former Big Four teams joined with the Saskatoon Sheiks in forming a new professional league in 1921 that intended to compete against the National Hockey League and Pacific Coast Hockey Association. The Western Canada Hockey League was recognized as a major league and granted the right to compete for the Stanley Cup. Shortly before the inaugural season was set to begin, Calgary Canadians president Dr. C.E. Coleman and Tigers manager Eddie Poulin agreed amalgamate the two franchises under the Tigers name, allowing Calgary to present a unified front in the new league.  The Tigers played the first professional hockey game in Calgary on December 19, 1921, defeating the Regina Capitals 3–2 before a crowd of 3,000 fans.   The Tigers, Eskimos and Capitals battled for first place in the league, each team holding the top spot numerous times throughout the season. The Tigers and Capitals finished tied for second, forcing a two-game, total-goals playoff to determine who would meet the Eskimos for the league championship.  In the series, the Capitals defeated the Tigers 1–0 in Calgary, while the two teams tied 1–1 in Regina sending the Capitals through by a 2–1 aggregate total.  Prior to the start of the 1922–23 season, the Tigers faced the Stanley Cup champion Toronto St. Patricks in two exhibition games.   They defeated the St. Pats 7–5 in Calgary, and again 6–2 in a game held in Winnipeg, Manitoba.  The WCHL and PCHA adopted an interlocking schedule for this season, with the Tigers struggling against their pacific coast opposition, winning just two of six games. Calgary finished third in the standings, behind Edmonton and Regina, as former Tiger Barney Stanley scored the winning goal against Calgary in a 2–1 victory by the Regina Capitals that eliminated Calgary from playoff contention. They ended the season with a 4–0 exhibition victory over the NHL's Ottawa Senators in a game described as one of the ""most sensational"" games ever held in Calgary.  The 1923–24 season began with tragedy, as Tigers' forward Foley Martin died of blood poisoning during the team's season opening road trip to the pacific coast.  The Tigers played on despite Martin's death, winning two of three games against their PCHA rivals.  The Tigers finished atop the league standings with 37 points. They met the Regina Capitals in the league championship in a two-game, total goals series. After battling Regina to a 2–2 draw in the Saskatchewan capital, the Tigers returned home to Calgary, capturing the championship on home ice in a 2–0 victory. They then moved on to face the Vancouver Maroons of the PCHA in the best-of-three Western Canadian final. After dropping the first game in Vancouver, the Tigers came back to defeat the Maroons 6–3 at home, and again 3–1 at a neutral site game in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The victory earned the Tigers the right to play for the Stanley Cup, the first such opportunity for a Calgary-based club.  Despite defeating the Maroons, the PCHA champions were not eliminated. Rather, the Tigers earned a bye into the finals, while Vancouver met the Montreal Canadiens in the semi-final. The blue, blanc et rouge swept Vancouver in two games, setting the matchup for the 1924 Stanley Cup Finals where the Canadiens easily handled the Tigers. In the first game, played at Mount Royal Arena in Montreal, Canadiens rookie Howie Morenz recorded a hat trick as Montreal won 6–1. Due to poor ice conditions, the second game was moved to the Ottawa Auditorium in Ottawa. Led by goaltender Georges Vezina, Montreal won 3–0 to sweep the series, and claim the Cup.  Calgary began the 1924–25 season with a series of exhibition games in eastern Canada.  They faced the St. Pats and Senators, proving to be a popular draw in the capital as Ottawa fans lined up for tickets for the pair of games played. Additionally, the Tigers negotiated to face the NHL's expansion Montreal Maroons if the newly constructed Montreal Forum was ready in time. Those games did not come to pass. In WCHL league play, the Tigers once again finished the regular season in first place.  Led by Oliver's team leading 20 goals, the Tigers earned a bye into the WCHL championship. Their opponent was the Victoria Cougars, who moved over to the WCHL following the collapse of the PCHA the previous summer. The Tigers were unable to earn a return trip to the Stanley Cup Finals, losing the two-game total-goals series 3–1.  The Cougars went on to become the last non-NHL team to win the Stanley Cup. The Tigers struggled throughout the 1925–26 season, languishing in last place for most of the season until a 2–0 victory over Victoria on the last day of the season moved Calgary one point ahead of Vancouver to end the season.  The financial pressures of trying to keep up with rapidly escalating salaries took its toll on the league.  The prairie clubs, including the Tigers, were struggling under financial hardships while a mild winter of 1925–26 reduced the quality of the natural ice at Victoria arena which, coupled with the team's poor performance, reduced attendance.  Manager Lance Turner confirmed on May 4, 1926 that the Tigers were sold to the National Hockey League, along with the franchises in Edmonton, Regina, Victoria, Vancouver and Portland, and that the league had ceased operations. The six franchises were sold for $300,000.  Turner immediately began efforts to form a new team and league that would operate as a ""class B"" league, one level below the NHL. Three weeks after the collapse of the Western League, the Tigers were reformed as a charter member of the five team Prairie Hockey League. The team struggled to attract fans in the Prairie League, and consequently announced late in the season that it would cease operations after one year. The Tigers were successful on the ice, however, as they finished atop the league standings and met the Saskatoon Sheiks in a best-of-three series for the league title. Calgary dropped the first game, 2–1 in Saskatoon, but tied the series with a 2–1 victory in Calgary on the strength of two goals in the last five minutes by Andy Aikenhead. The Tigers were then awarded the league championship after the Sheiks defaulted the third game, refusing to play in opposition to the referee assigned for the deciding game. As Prairie champions, the Tigers traveled east to face the Winnipeg Maroons for the western Canadian professional championship. Calgary won the first game, then were awarded the title after the Maroons were unable to play the second game when the American Hockey Association rescheduled their league playoff series and created a conflict. The Tigers ended their season with exhibition games in the United States before the team was disbanded.  North Western Hockey League  In 1932, the Tigers were revived as a charter franchise of a reformed, minor-professional, Western Canada Hockey League. They opened the season with a 1–0 defeat in Edmonton on December 7, 1932 in what was the first professional game for either city in six years, while a near capacity crowd of 4,100 fans witnessed a 7–0 victory by the Tigers over the Eskimos two nights later in Calgary. The Tigers finished the season in first place with on the strength of giving up the fewest goals against during the season, but struggled to attract fans.  Attendance declined throughout the season to a low of just 560 for their victory over Saskatoon in early March that clinched the league's top record.  Overall, the team averaged 2,270 fans per game. Having earned a bye to the championship series, the Tigers faced the Eskimos in a best-of-five series marred by poor ice caused unseasonably warm weather in both cities. Following a 1–1 tie in the first game at Calgary, the league ordered the remaining games of the series be played in Edmonton due to the poor condition of the ice surface. The second game was also tied at 1 after bad ice in Edmonton forced it to be ended early. Two victories for the Eskimos pushed Calgary to the brink of elimination before the Tigers rebounded with a 5–1 victory in the fifth game.  The ties earlier in the series forced the teams to a sixth game that also went to overtime tied at 1 before the Eskimos scored to win the championship after four minutes of an extra period.  The league reformed as the North Western Hockey League following the season after the Saskatchewan clubs dropped out and were replaced with three teams on the Pacific Coast.  Calgary again won the regular-season title in 1933–34, advancing directly to the league championship, on the strength of a 12–3 victory over the Vancouver Lions in the final game of the regular season. Dutch Gainor won the league scoring title with 43 points. Fearing a repeat of the previous season's playoff disaster, the league ordered Calgary to play their championship series against the Lions in Seattle and Vancouver as both cities had arenas capable of making artificial ice. The disadvantage did not affect the Tigers in the opening game of the series, a 5–2 victory at Seattle. The teams traded victories in the next three contests, ending in a 2–1 Vancouver win in the fourth game that tied the series at 2 wins apiece. Calgary won the championship with a 6–1 victory before a Vancouver crowd of over 6,000 fans.  The 1934 championship would prove to be the Tigers' last hurrah, as the team fell to the bottom of the NWHL standings in 1934–35, winning only three games. They once again finished in last place in 1935–36 and were embroiled in another disputer with Edmonton over the rights to a player as the Eskimos claimed they had gained the rights to Tony Savage from the Montreal Canadiens though he had already been sent to Calgary on loan.  The Tigers issued an ultimatum to the league, threatening to disband for the season if Savage did not remain in Calgary. Savage ultimately remained with Calgary for the entire season.  1936 proved to be the final year for the Tigers, as the Great Depression and declining interest in professional hockey in favour of the senior game had threatened the team's viability. After the Eskimos announced intentions to relocate to Victoria, British Columbia as part of a realignment of the league, Tigers' manager Clair Manning contemplated relocating the franchise to Spokane, Washington. The team instead hoped to operate for another season in Calgary, but met its final demise after the NWHL reformed into the Pacific Coast Hockey League for 1936–37 and denied the Tigers' application to join the new league.

Exhibition games played after are not included  Hall of Famers  The WCHL's short and unstable existence was a result of salary escalation caused by having three leagues competing for top talent. As a result, by the mid-1920s, hockey players were among the highest paid athletes in North America, with top players able to demand even higher salaries than the top baseball stars of the time. Though the WCHL lasted only five years, the Tigers boasted five future Hockey Hall of Famers on their roster during that time.  Barney Stanley, a former PCHA star, spent two seasons with the Tigers from 1920–22. Joining the Tigers in the last season of the Big Four League, he once again turned pro when the Tigers joined the WCHL.  Stanley led the Tigers in scoring with 26 goals in 1921–22 before being traded to Regina.  Red Dutton, a World War I veteran who refused doctors orders to have his leg amputated after suffering a shrapnel wound, played 123 games with the Tigers before moving to the NHL where he played 449 more with the Montreal Maroons and New York Americans.  Rusty Crawford, a former standout in the National Hockey Association and National Hockey League before the war, spent three seasons in Calgary from 1922–25.  Crawford recorded 19 goals in 64 games as a Tiger.  Herb Gardiner began his professional career in Calgary in 1920, remaining with the Tigers until he was sold to the Montreal Canadiens in 1926, where he would go on to win the Hart Memorial Trophy as NHL Most Valuable Player in 1927.  Harry Oliver also began his pro career in Calgary, playing with the Tigers from 1921–26 where he scored 90 goals before being sold to the Boston Bruins. Oliver would go on to play eleven seasons in the NHL with the Bruins and New York Americans.  Head coaches Barney Stanley (1921–22) Herb Gardiner (1922–26)  Legacy The uniform of the Calgary Tigers served as the inspiration for the ""vintage"" uniform of the Calgary Flames which was worn in the Heritage Classic game in February 2011. While the Calgary Flames do not trace their ancestry back to the Tigers (the Atlanta Flames club was purchased by Calgary businessmen in the 1980s), the organization had wanted to recognize the first professional hockey club in Calgary history for this event and selected the colourful uniforms of the Tigers.

Heleen Mees,"Heleen Mees (born Heleen Nijkamp, 1968) is a Dutch opinion writer, economist, and lawyer. Involved with politics and public policy in the Netherlands and the US, she has also taught at universities in both countries.  Biography Mees graduated in Economy and Law at University of Groningen. From 1992 to 1998, she worked for the Dutch Treasury in The Hague, for two years as spokeswoman for former State Secretary Willem Vermeend. She then worked for the European Commission in Brussels from 1998 to 2000. In 2000 she emigrated to the US, where she changed her surname from Nijkamp to Mees.  In New York Mees was initially employed as a European affairs consultant for Ernst & Young. When her contract was not renewed, Mees stayed in New York and worked as an independent consultant on European affairs. Mees also started writing opinion pieces for several Dutch newspapers.  Mees' breakthrough as an opinion writer (she is credited as a third wave feminist) in the Netherlands came in 2006 when she wrote ""The time is long overdue that women should go to work"", her first feminist opinion piece in NRC Handelsblad. The same year, she co-founded Women on Top, an organization that until 2011 advocated more women in top jobs. As a firm advocate of female ambition and a promoter of more women in the supervisory and executive boards of big companies, Mees has been described as a ""power feminist"".  From 2006 to 2010 she wrote a bi-weekly column in NRC Handelsblad, and from 2012 to 2013 a weekly column for Het Financieele Dagblad. She has written for publications such as Foreign Policy and for Project Syndicate In September 2015 she was a guest columnist for de Volkskrant, and in 2016 began a biweekly column for that same paper.  She was vice-president of the chapter of the Dutch Labour Party (PvdA) in New York. From 2005 to 2008 she worked as volunteer-fundraiser for the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton. In July 2013, Mees was arrested in New York on charges of stalking her former lover, the chief economist of Citigroup, Willem Buiter. In March 2014, the court decided that the case against Mees was to be dismissed in one year provided that she complies with two conditions. Later that year, in September 2014, Mees responded by filing for damages against Buiter.  In November 2016, Mees simultaneously lost both lawsuits in Amsterdam and New York.  In August 2012, Mees completed a doctoral thesis at the Erasmus School of Economics, in which she argued that the primary cause of the 2008 global financial crisis was the flourishing economy in China and resulting savings and government investments by the Chinese. While completing her research, she worked as an Adjunct Assistant Professor at Tilburg University. From September 2012 until July 2013, Mees was employed as an Adjunct Associate Professor of Public Administration at New York University's Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service.

"Henry Cavendish, 3rd Baron Waterpark","Henry Manners Cavendish, 3rd Baron Waterpark (8 November 1793 – 31 March 1863), was a British nobleman and Whig politician.  Waterpark was the son of Richard Cavendish, 2nd Baron Waterpark, and his wife Juliana (née Cooper). He succeeded his father in the barony in 1830 but as this was an Irish peerage it did not entitle him to an automatic seat in the House of Lords. The same year he was instead elected to the House of Commons as one of two representatives for Knaresborough, a seat he held until 1832, and then sat for Derbyshire South from 1832 to 1835. He served as a Lord-in-waiting between 1846 and 1852, and again from 1853 to 1858. He returned to the House of Commons in 1854 when he was elected for Lichfield, and sat for this constituency until 1856. Between 1859 and 1861 he was a Lord of the Bedchamber to Albert, Prince Consort. Waterpark was also a Colonel in the Derbyshire Militia. He was the lieutenant-colonel of the King's Own Staffordshire Militia until he resigned in June 1832.  Lord Waterpark married the Hon. Eliza Jane, daughter of Thomas Anson, 1st Viscount Anson, in 1837. He died in March 1863, aged 69, and was succeeded in the barony by his son, Henry.

Until 2011, the station was owned by Trevecca Nazarene University, and played Contemporary Christian music.  A key figure in the station's history is former General Manager David Deese. Deese, who still teaches at the university, led the radio station as a student, then as a faculty member. He was able to increase the station's transmission power on a couple of occasions and helped the university purchase 760 AM WENO and later put WNRZ, a repeater at 91.5 MHz in Dickson, on the air.  WECV is simulcast on WNRZ (covering western Middle Tennessee) and translator stations on 93.9 in Gallatin and 99.5 in Clarksville.  In the fall of 2010, Trevecca Nazarene University announced the sale of WNAZ, WNRZ and its translator stations to Bott Radio Network. On February 18, 2011 at noon, the station was transferred to Bott, at which time it began airing Bott Radio Network programming.

Monroe piercing,"A Monroe piercing is a lip piercing placed off-center, above the upper lip on the left-hand side and is meant to resemble Marilyn Monroe's beauty spot, although Monroe's beauty spot was on her cheek, not her lip. The Madonna piercing is similar but worn on the right-hand side.  Description This piercing is typically fitted with a 14, 16, or 18 gauge labret barbell, the bars of which are usually shortened after healing.  A variation on this piercing are angel bites, with both the Madonna and Monroe style piercings worn on either side of the upper lip. This piercing may also be referred to as a Crayfish, Angel Bites, or Anti Bites, being the anti version of snake bites. When long barbells are worn in this piercing, they look similar to the antennae on a crayfish, hence the name. Most people with a Monroe piercing favor a metal ball or a jewel on the outer-end. The lip can often swell considerably after the piercing and will need both facial and oral aftercare to keep both sides of the jewelry clean at all times. Monroes, like all piercings, are prone to infection and it is vital that the piercing is cleaned regularly. Scarring is minimal to none if properly taken care of.  Health impacts An advantage of a monroe piercing is that the lip area generally heals faster than other piercings.  The estimated healing time given by professional piercers for this type of lip piercing is between 8–12 weeks, but many find it heals in 3–6 weeks.  The monroe can be a very painful piercing process, as this area of the body contains a large system of nerves. There is a small risk of piercing the superior labial artery, which lies just above the upper lip.  The amount of pain experienced during the piercing process differs from person to person and depends on the specific location of the piercing. Those with thicker lips or well-exercised facial muscles will have more flesh or muscle to pierce, so they may experience more discomfort. Men may experience slightly more pain than women, as repeated shaving can make the skin of the upper lip tougher and harder to pierce. The orbicularis oris (the sphincter muscle around the mouth) is used in the playing of brass and woodwind instruments; as a result, players of these instruments tend to have a larger muscle around the mouth and may experience more discomfort during the piercing process.  As with similar piercings, monroes can cause long-term damage to the gums and teeth. The back-disk of metal jewellery worn in this piercing rubs against them, potentially resulting in gum recession or damage to tooth enamel. Plastic labret-studs are available to minimize this problem.

3850 Peltier,"3850 Peltier, provisional designation , is a Florian asteroid and suspected interloper from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 4 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 7 October 1986, by American astronomer Edward Bowell at Lowell's Anderson Mesa Station, near Flagstaff, Arizona. The asteroid was named after American amateur astronomer Leslie Peltier.  Orbit and classification   In the SMASS taxonomy, Peltier is a V-type asteroid but possesses the orbital characteristics of a member of the Flora family, which is one of the largest groups of stony S-type asteroids in the main-belt. It is therefore thought to be an unrelated interloper that does not origin from the Flora family's parent body. Peltier orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 1.9–2.6 AU once every 3 years and 4 months (1,220 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.16 and an inclination of 5° with respect to the ecliptic. In 1949, it was first identified as  at Johannesburg. The body's observation arc begins at Crimea-Nauchnij in 1979, when it was identified as , 10 years prior to its official discovery observation at Anderson Mesa.  Physical characteristics  Rotation period   A rotational lightcurve of Peltier was obtained by Czech astronomer Petr Pravec at Ondřejov Observatory in October 2006. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of 2.4287 hours with a brightness variation of 0.09 magnitude (). In December 2013, photometric observations by Australian amateur astronomer Julian Oey gave a concurring period of 2.4289 hours and an amplitude of 0.10 magnitude ().  Diameter and albedo   Peltier has not been observed by any space-based surveys such as the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite, or NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for V-type asteroids of 0.40 and calculates a diameter of 4.00 kilometers using an absolute magnitude of 13.6.  Naming   This minor planet was named in memory of American amateur astronomer Leslie Peltier (1900–1980), who has discovered 12 comets and several novae including Nova Herculis 1963. Naming citation was provided by David H. Levy and published by the MPC on 20 May 1989 ().

Epimenides,"Epimenides of Cnossos (or  Epimenides of Crete) (; ) was a semi-mythical 7th or 6th century BC Greek seer and philosopher-poet, from Knossos or Phaistos.  Life While tending his father's sheep, Epimenides is said to have fallen asleep for fifty-seven years in a Cretan cave sacred to Zeus, after which he reportedly awoke with the gift of prophecy (Diogenes Laërtius i. 109–115). Plutarch writes that Epimenides purified Athens after the pollution brought by the Alcmeonidae, and that the seer's expertise in sacrifices and reform of funeral practices were of great help to Solon in his reform of the Athenian state. The only reward he would accept was a branch of the sacred olive, and a promise of perpetual friendship between Athens and Cnossus (Plutarch, Life of Solon, 12; Aristotle, Ath. Pol. 1).  Athenaeus also mentions him, in connection with the self-sacrifice of the erastes and eromenos pair of Cratinus and Aristodemus, who were believed to have given their lives in order to purify Athens. Even in antiquity there were those who held the story to be mere fiction (The Deipnosophists, XIII. 78–79). Diogenes Laërtius preserves a number of spurious letters between Epimenides and Solon in his Lives of the Philosophers. Epimenides was also said to have prophesied at Sparta on military matters.  He died in Crete at an advanced age; according to his countrymen, who afterwards honoured him as a god, he lived nearly three hundred years. According to another story, he was taken prisoner in a war between the Spartans and Cnossians, and put to death by his captors, because he refused to prophesy favourably for them. Pausanias reports that when Epimenides died, his skin was found to be covered with tattooed writing. This was considered odd, because the Greeks reserved tattooing for slaves. Some modern scholars have seen this as evidence that Epimenides was heir to the shamanic religions of Central Asia, because tattooing is often associated with shamanic initiation. The skin of Epimenides was preserved at the courts of the ephores in Sparta, conceivably as a good-luck charm. Epimenides is also reckoned with Melampus and Onomacritus as one of the founders of Orphism.  According to Diogenes Laërtius, Epimenides met Pythagoras in Crete, and they went to the Cave of Ida.  Works  Several prose and poetic works, now lost, were attributed to Epimenides, including a theogony, an epic poem on the Argonautic expedition, prose works on purifications and sacrifices, a cosmogony, oracles, a work on the laws of Crete, and a treatise on Minos and Rhadymanthus.  Cretica Epimenides' Cretica (Κρητικά) is quoted twice in the New Testament. Its only source is a 9th-century Syriac commentary by Isho'dad of Merv on the Acts of the Apostles, discovered, edited and translated (into Greek) by Prof. J. Rendel Harris in a series of articles.  In the poem, Minos addresses Zeus thus:  The ""lie"" of the Cretans is that Zeus was mortal; Epimenides considered Zeus immortal. ""Cretans, always liars,"" with the same theological intent as Epimenides, also appears in the Hymn to Zeus of Callimachus. The fourth line is quoted (with a reference to one of ""your own poets"")  in Acts of the Apostles, chapter 17, verse 28.  The second line is quoted, with a veiled attribution (""a prophet of their own""), in the Epistle to Titus, chapter 1, verse 12, to warn Titus about the Cretans. The ""prophet"" in Titus 1:12 is identified by Clement of Alexandria as ""Epimenides"" (Stromata, i. 14). In this passage, Clement mentions that ""some say"" Epimenides should be counted among the seven wisest philosophers.  Chrysostom (Homily 3 on Titus) gives an alternative fragment: For even a tomb, King, of you They made, who never died, but ever shall be.  Epimenides paradox It is not clear when Epimenides became associated with the Epimenides paradox, a variation of the liar paradox. Epimenides himself does not appear to have intended any irony or paradox in his statement ""Cretans, always liars."" In the epistle to Titus, there is a warning that ""One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, the Cretians are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies."" In the Middle Ages, many forms of the liar paradox were studied under the heading of insolubilia, but these were not associated with Epimenides.

53rd Army (Soviet Union),"The 53rd Army was a field army of the Soviet Union's Red Army which was formed in August 1941, disbanded in December 1941, and reformed in May 1942.  It fought throughout World War II before again being disbanded after the war in October 1945. The army was first formed for the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran and was disbanded there in December 1941. The army reformed in May 1942. It fought in the Demyansk Pocket, the Battle of Kursk, the Battle of Belgorod, the Battle of the Dnieper, the Battle of the Korsun–Cherkassy Pocket, the Uman–Botoșani Offensive, the Second Jassy–Kishinev Offensive, the Battle of Debrecen, the Budapest Offensive, and the Prague Offensive. At the end of the war in Europe it was moved to the Far East and fought in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria. The army was disbanded in October 1945.  History  First formation  The 53rd Army was created by a Stavka directive on August 23, 1941.  Its immediate task was to occupy Iran in conjunction with the British Army and other Commonwealth armed forces in August and September 1941.  The purpose was to secure Iranian oil fields as well as safeguard the shipment of Lend-Lease war material from the US through Iran to the USSR.  Units of the 53rd Army crossed the border on August 27, overcame resistance from Iranian border guards, and advanced towards Mashad. The 53rd Army was disbanded in December 1941.  Second formation  The 53rd Army was reformed on May 1, 1942 from divisions of the 34th Army with the mission of fighting on the Northwestern Front. Until March 1943 it fought the German 16th Army in the Demyansk Offensive and unsuccessfully attempted to cut the Ramushevo corridor. After the German breakout the 53rd Army was transferred to the Stavka reserve on March 22 and then to the Reserve Front on April 10.  On April 15, it was transferred a third time, to the Steppe Front, where it received new units and fought in the Battle of Kursk. On July 16 its troops took defensive positions on a line from Podolhi to Poidjarug.  It fought subsequently in the Battle of Belgorod, pushing back German troops from July 19 onwards.  In August and September 1943 the Army fought in the Belgorod-Kharkov Offensive and the capture of eastern Ukraine.  Units of the 53rd Army advanced more than 200 km and in cooperation with other armies captured Kharkov on August 23 and Poltava a month later.  On October 5 it reached the Dnieper.  The 53rd Army forced the Dnieper, captured a bridgehead southeast of Kremenchug, and fought hard until mid-November to retain its foothold on the right bank.     The Army was transferred to the 2nd Ukrainian Front on October 20 and attacked along the Kirovohrad axis.  By December 24 it had reached the line of Krasnosele and Znamianka, where it was stopped by German reserves.  On January 5, 1944 the attack was resumed and the defending German units were destroyed.  At the end of January the 53rd Army fought in the Korsun-Shevchenkovsky Offensive and attacked in the direction of Zlatopol.  In the Uman–Botoșani Offensive it captured Balta on March 29, Kotovsk three days later and, at the end of the offensive, a bridgehead on the Dniester near Dubăsari.   Then it fought in the Second Jassy–Kishinev Offensive, attacking along the Focșani axis, and entered Bucharest on August 31.  At the end of September it was on the Hungarian border northeast of Arad.  In October it fought in the Battle of Debrecen, during which Army commander German Tarasov was killed on 19 October.  In cooperation with the 1st Guards Mechanized Cavalry Group, it broke through German defenses and advanced 100 kilometers to the Tisza near Polgár.  Between November 7 and 10, 1944, the 53rd Army forced the Tisza during the Budapest Offensive north of Abádszalók.  In conjunction with the 110th Guards Rifle Division and 3rd Guards Airborne Division of the 27th Army it captured Eger on November 30.  The 53rd Army then attacked along the Lučenec axis, reached the Hron at the end of February 1945, and then went on the defensive.    During the Bratislava-Brno Operation the 53rd Army crossed the Hron on March 25 and captured Vráble on March 28, Nitra on March 30, Hlohovec on April 1, and Hodonín on April 13.  Brno was captured on April 26 in cooperation with the 6th Guards Tank Army and 1st Guards Cavalry Mechanized Group. In the last days before the German surrender the 53rd Army fought in the Prague Offensive.  From June to July 1945 it was deployed in Mongolia near Choibalsan, and at the beginning of August the 53rd Army was transferred to the Transbaikal Front.  It fought in the Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation and was disbanded in October 1945.

Delta-v budget,"In astrodynamics and aerospace, a delta-v budget is an estimate of the total change in velocity (delta-v) required for a space mission. It is calculated as the sum of the delta-v required to perform each propulsive maneuver needed during the mission. As input to the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation, it determines how much propellant is required for a vehicle of given empty mass and propulsion system.  Delta-v is a scalar quantity dependent only on the desired trajectory and not on the mass of the space vehicle. For example, although more fuel is needed to transfer a heavier communication satellite from low Earth orbit to geosynchronous orbit than for a lighter one, the delta-v required is the same. Delta-v is also additive, as contrasted to rocket burn time, the latter having greater effect later in the mission when more fuel has been used up.  Tables of the delta-v required to move between different space regime are useful in the conceptual planning of space missions. In the absence of an atmosphere, the delta-v is typically the same for changes in orbit in either direction; in particular, gaining and losing speed cost an equal effort. An atmosphere can be used to slow a spacecraft by aerobraking.  A typical delta-v budget might enumerate various classes of maneuvers, delta-v per maneuver, and number of each maneuver required over the life of the mission, then simply sum the total delta-v, much like a typical financial budget. Because the delta-v needed to achieve the mission usually varies with the relative position of the gravitating bodies, launch windows are often calculated from porkchop plots that show delta-v plotted against the launch time.  General principles The Tsiolkovsky rocket equation shows that the delta-v of a rocket (stage) is proportional to the logarithm of the fuelled-to-empty mass ratio of the vehicle, and to the specific impulse of the rocket engine. A key goal in designing space-mission trajectories is to minimize the required delta-v to reduce the size and expense of the rocket that would be needed to successfully deliver any particular payload to its destination.  The simplest delta-v budget can be calculated with Hohmann transfer, which moves from one circular orbit to another coplanar circular orbit via an elliptical transfer orbit. In some cases a bi-elliptic transfer can give a lower delta-v.  A more complex transfer occurs when the orbits are not coplanar. In that case there is an additional delta-v necessary to change the plane of the orbit. The velocity of the vehicle needs substantial burns at the intersection of the two orbital planes and the delta-v is usually extremely high. However, these plane changes can be almost free in some cases if the gravity and mass of a planetary body are used to perform the deflection. In other cases, boosting up to a relatively high altitude apoapsis gives low speed before performing the plane change, thus requiring lower total delta-v.  The slingshot effect can be used to give a boost of speed/energy; if a vehicle goes past a planetary or lunar body, it is possible to pick up (or lose) some of that body's orbital velocity relative to the sun or another planet.  Another effect is the Oberth effect—this can be used to greatly decrease the delta-v needed, because using propellant at low potential energy/high speed multiplies the effect of a burn. Thus for example the delta-v for a Hohmann transfer from Earth's orbital radius to Mars's orbital radius (to overcome the sun's gravity) is many kilometres per second, but the incremental burn from low Earth orbit (LEO) over and above the burn to overcome Earth's gravity is far less if the burn is done close to Earth than if the burn to reach a Mars transfer orbit is performed at Earth's orbit, but far away from Earth.  A less used effect is low energy transfers. These are highly nonlinear effects that work by orbital resonances and by choosing trajectories close to Lagrange points. They can be very slow, but use very little delta-v.  Because delta-v depends on the position and motion of celestial bodies, particularly when using the slingshot effect and Oberth effect, the delta-v budget changes with launch time. These can be plotted on a porkchop plot.  Course corrections usually also require some propellant budget. Propulsion systems never provide precisely the right propulsion in precisely the right direction at all times, and navigation also introduces some uncertainty. Some propellant needs to be reserved to correct variations from the optimum trajectory.  Budget  Launch/landing   The delta-v requirements for sub-orbital spaceflight are much lower than for orbital spaceflight. For the Ansari X Prize altitude of 100 km, Space Ship One required a delta-v of roughly 1.4 km/s. To reach the initial low Earth orbit of the International Space Station of 300 km (now 400 km), the delta-v is over six times higher, about 9.4 km/s. Because of the exponential nature of the rocket equation the orbital rocket needs to be considerably bigger.  Launch to LEO—this not only requires an increase of velocity from 0 to 7.8 km/s, but also typically 1.5–2 km/s for atmospheric drag and gravity drag Re-entry from LEO—the delta-v required is the orbital maneuvering burn to lower perigee into the atmosphere, atmospheric drag takes care of the rest.  Earth–Moon space—high thrust   Delta-v needed to move inside the Earth–Moon system (speeds lower than escape velocity) are given in km/s. This table assumes that the Oberth effect is being used—this is possible with high thrust chemical propulsion but not with current (as of 2018) electrical propulsion.  Earth–Moon space—low thrust   Current electric ion thrusters produce a very low thrust (milli-newtons, yielding a small fraction of a g), so the Oberth effect cannot normally be used. This results in the journey requiring a higher delta-v and frequently a large increase in time compared to a high thrust chemical rocket. Nonetheless, the high specific impulse of electrical thrusters may significantly reduce the cost of the flight. For missions in the Earth–Moon system, an increase in journey time from days to months could be unacceptable for human space flight, but differences in flight time for interplanetary flights are less significant and could be favorable.  The table below presents delta-vs in km/s, normally accurate to 2 significant figures and will be the same in both directions, unless aerobraking is used as described in the high thrust section above.   Earth Lunar Gateway—high thrust   The Lunar Gateway space station is planned to be deployed in a highly elliptical seven-day near-rectilinear halo orbit (NRHO) around the Moon.  Spacecraft launched from Earth would perform a powered flyby of the Moon followed by a NRHO orbit insertion burn to dock with the Gateway as it approaches the apoapsis point of its orbit.   Interplanetary   The spacecraft is assumed to be using chemical propulsion and the Oberth effect.  According to Marsden and Ross, ""The energy levels of the Sun–Earth  and  points differ from those of the Earth–Moon system by only 50 m/s (as measured by maneuver velocity).""  We may apply the formula  (where μ = GM is the standard gravitational parameter of the sun, see Hohmann transfer orbit) to calculate the Δv in km/s needed to arrive at various destinations from Earth (assuming circular orbits for the planets, and using perihelion distance for Pluto). In this table, the column labeled ""Δv to enter Hohmann orbit from Earth's orbit"" gives the change from Earth's velocity to the velocity needed to get on a Hohmann ellipse whose other end will be at the desired distance from the sun. The column labeled ""v exiting LEO"" gives the velocity needed (in a non-rotating frame of reference centred on Earth) when 300 km above Earth's surface. This is obtained by adding to the specific kinetic energy the square of the speed (7.73 km/s) of this low Earth orbit (that is, the depth of Earth's gravity well at this LEO). The column ""Δv from LEO"" is simply the previous speed minus 7.73 km/s. The transit time is calculated as  years.  Note that the values in the table only give the Δv needed to get to the orbital distance of the planet. The speed relative to the planet will still be considerable, and in order to go into orbit around the planet either aerocapture is needed using the planet's atmosphere, or more Δv is needed.  The New Horizons space probe to Pluto achieved a near-Earth speed of over 16 km/s which was enough to escape from the sun. (It also got a boost from a fly-by of Jupiter.)  To get to the sun, it is actually not necessary to use a Δv of 24 km/s. One can use 8.8 km/s to go very far away from the sun, then use a negligible Δv to bring the angular momentum to zero, and then fall into the sun. This can be considered a sequence of two Hohmann transfers, one up and one down. Also, the table does not give the values that would apply when using the moon for a gravity assist. There are also possibilities of using one planet, like Venus which is the easiest to get to, to assist getting to other planets or the sun. The Galileo spacecraft used Venus once and Earth twice in order to reach Jupiter. The Ulysses solar probe used Jupiter to attain polar orbit around the sun.   Delta-vs between Earth, Moon and Mars   Delta-v needed for various orbital manoeuvers using conventional rockets.

Lower-delta-v transfers than shown can often be achieved, but involve rare transfer windows or take significantly longer, see: fuzzy orbital transfers.  Electric propulsion vehicles going from Mars C3 = 0 to Earth C3 = 0 without using the Oberth effect need a larger Delta-v of between 2.6 km/s and 3.15 km/s. Not all possible links are shown.  The Delta-v for C3 = 0 to Mars transfer must be applied at pericentre, i.e. immediately after accelerating to the escape trajectory, and do not agree with the formula above which gives 0.4 from Earth escape and 0.65 from Mars escape.  The figures for LEO to GTO, GTO to GEO, and LEO to GEO are inconsistent. The figure of 30 for LEO to the sun is also too high.  Near-Earth objects   Near-Earth objects are asteroids whose orbits can bring them within about 0.3 astronomical units of the Earth.  There are thousands of such objects that are easier to reach than the Moon or Mars.  Their one-way delta-v budgets from LEO range upwards from , which is less than 2/3 of the delta-v needed to reach the Moon's surface. But NEOs with low delta-v budgets have long synodic periods, and the intervals between times of closest approach to the Earth (and thus most efficient missions) can be decades long.  The delta-v required to return from Near-Earth objects is usually quite small, sometimes as low as , with aerocapture using Earth's atmosphere. However, heat shields are required for this, which add mass and constrain spacecraft geometry. The orbital phasing can be problematic; once rendezvous has been achieved, low delta-v return windows can be fairly far apart (more than a year, often many years), depending on the body.  In general, bodies that are much further away or closer to the sun than Earth, have more frequent windows for travel, but usually require larger delta-vs.  See also  Bi-elliptic transfer Gravity assist Hohmann transfer Oberth effect Orbital speed Tsiolkovsky rocket equation Pork-chop plot Synodic period  Notes  References  External links JavaScript Delta V calculator Decorative Delta-V Map Atomic Rockets - What's The Mission?

Third Mind Records,"Third Mind Records was a British independent record label, founded in February 1983 by Gary Levermore.  Name The label derived its name from the book The Third Mind, a work compiled by Beat Generation author William S. Burroughs and artist Brion Gysin using the cut-up technique.  History Third Mind originated from the group and fanzine Tone Death that Levermore had founded in the middle of 1982 together with two friends. During that time Levermore started contacting bands he had discovered through diverse media and on concerts which would finally be featured in Tone Death. While writing the editorial for the second issue of the fanzine, to be released around February 1983, Levermore ""began considering the possibility of releasing a cassette containing contributions by some of the groups that had been featured in the two issues to date."" His considerations led to the double cassette release Rising From The Red Sand Vols. I&II which was followed by volumes III and IV in 1983. The compilations featured a number of post-punk, electronic and industrial bands some of which would be later on the label's roster, and sped up Levermore's ""transition from zine enthusiast into label owner.""  The Rising From The Red Sand series was met with stronger demands than Levermore had anticipated. Sending promo copies to some shops and getting a five star review in Sounds magazine led to a great number of order requests. The London-based shop of Rough Trade ordered a substantial number of copies. ""Those compilations sold quite well"", remembered Levermore, ""and more or less provided the fund base to actually put out three or four albums.""  After this initial success Third Mind developed slowly, with an annual quantity of seven or eight records in the first years. Levermore had to deal with tight budgets, the label's artists recorded ""for very, very low sums of money."" Signing Canadian industrial band Front Line Assembly and British singer-songwriter Bill Pritchard in 1987 meant a major step forward for the label making them the label's flagships in different markets and entailing also further post-Third Mind management duties.  All of the label's releases until after Front Line Assembly's 1990 album Caustic Grip were licensed to American independent label Wax Trax.  Third Mind started off with Rough Trade as distributor which changed between 1987 and 1988 when the label switched to Play It Again Sam. Due to ""policy differences"" Third Mind and Play It Again Sam terminated their partnership and in 1992 Levermore moved on to partner with American metal label Roadrunner Records. In 1991, Roadrunner had already bought a 50 percent stake of Third Mind which gave Levermore a greater financial leeway since Roadrunner paid Levermore ""a salary for three years to continue running the label while they financed new releases."" Before Roadrunner, Levermore said, ""there's been many occasions over the years when I've seen a band that I wanted to work with go somewhere else and have a bit of success.""  Levermore and Roadrunner ended their collaboration in April 1994. When Third Mind ended its business activities in the same year, it had released more than 100 titles. The rights to all releases passed over to Roadrunner.  Fourth Dimension Records In 1983 Levermore started Fourth Dimension Records as an offshoot of Third Mind. After two releases he handed over business to Richard Johnson from British fanzine Grim Humour. The second release was born out of collaboration between Levermore and Johnson as flexi disc for Grim Humour. Johnson had already thought about starting a label by himself and ""when Gary told me he wouldn’t be operating FD after this second release, it just made sense for me to continue with the name.""

Mostyska,"Mostyska (, , both in the plural, is a small city in Yavoriv Raion, Lviv Oblast (region) of Ukraine. It hosts the administration of Mostyska urban hromada, one of the hromadas of Ukraine. Population: . The city is located in western portion of Sian Lowland near the border with Poland ().  Description The names Mościska and Mostyska share a common etymological Slav root ""most"", which means ""bridge"", or the place associated with ""river crossings"".   In 1340, Mostyska, together with the territory of Red Ruthenia, was annexed by Polish King Kazimierz Wielki, and the town remained in Poland for over 400 years, until 1772 (see Partitions of Poland). Mościska, as it was called, was in the Przemyśl region, and the Ruthenian Voivodeship. In 1404, King Wladyslaw Jagiello granted it a Magdeburg town charter. Mościska was the seat of a starosta, and the town was several times destroyed during Tatar, Turkish and Wallachian raids. In the late 18th century, when it was already part of Austrian Galicia, the population of Mościska was 2,200, with a large Jewish minority. During the Second Polish Republic, Mościska was a county seat in Lwow Voivodeship, with its population reaching 5,000.   In late September 1939, during the Invasion of Poland, Mościska was seized by the Red Army. Its ethnic Polish population was routed, with thousands sent to Siberia. In June 1941, the town was captured by the Wehrmacht, which remained there until July 1944. In the autumn of 1945, the deportation, or so-called ""repatriation"", of Poles began (see Polish population transfers (1944–46)). It lasted until 1948, and as a result, most ethnic Poles were forced out of the town, together with monks from the foundation monastery of the Redemptorist fathers. This was the redemptorists' ""Mother house"" re-established in Poland for a third time in 1883 after the order's expulsion by Napoleon in 1809. Most of the priests left in the summer 1946, taking with them the holy icon and everything they were allowed to carry with them, including sculptures and clothes. Those who remained were arrested in May 1948 by the NKVD secret police, with two of the priests sent to Siberia. Afterwards, the complex of the monastery was turned into a warehouse. Currently, it serves as a hospital.   Today, Mostyska is one of main centres of the Polish minority in Ukraine. In 1989, a regional office of the Association of Polish Culture of the Lviv Land was opened. At present Poles make up 36% of population. In 2002, a Polish - language middle school was opened with 250 students.  Until 18 July 2020, Mostyska was the administrative center of Mostyska Raion. The raion was abolished in July 2020 as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Lviv Oblast to seven. The area of Mostyska Raion was merged into Yavoriv Raion.  In popular culture Mostyska is mentioned regularly in repertoire of Ukrainian music band ""Kurwa Matj"".

Winiges of Spoleto,"Winiges (or Winichis) (contemporary , ) (died 822) was the Duke of Spoleto (dux Spolitanus) from 789 to his death. He was probably a Lombard in the entourage of Charlemagne when he was sent in 788 to lead Hildeprand of Spoleto and Grimoald III of Benevento in cooperation with Frankish troops against a Byzantine invasion.  In this, his first recorded action, he was successful, defeating the Greeks led by Theodoros in Apulia. Hildeprand, however, died on the campaign and Charlemagne appointed Winiges to succeed him in the Duchy of Spoleto.  Winiges was appointed by Charlemagne to act as his missus dominicus in the Ducatus Romae and he was at Saint Peter's Basilica when Pope Leo III was assaulted on 25 April 799. It was then he who brought him to shelter in Spoleto until he could safely return to Rome.  Winiges got involved in a war with Grimoald of Benevento, however, and was captured while being besieged at Lucera in 802. He was held captive for a year before being released in 803.  While Leo III was nearing death in 815, the Roman citizens revolted, but King Bernard sent Winiges to Rome to quell the unrest.  In 822, Winiges abdicated his worldly office and retired to a monastery, where he died not too long after (probably that same year). His successor was Suppo I, Brixiæ civitatis comes (""Count of the city of Brescia"").  References  Sources Hodgkin, Thomas. Italy and her Invaders. Clarendon Press: 1895.

Charles Spinola,"Charles Spinola (1564 – 10 September 1622), also known as Carlo Spinola, was a Jesuit missionary from Genoa, Italy, martyred in Japan as a missionary.  Life Charles (or Carlo) Spinola was born in January 1564 in Genoa, Italy, the son of Ottavio Spinola, Count of Tassarolo. He was educated in Spain and in the Jesuit school in Nola, Italy, where he lived with his uncle, Philip Cardinal Spinola, Bishop of Nola. He entered the Jesuit novitiate in December 1584, and studied in Naples, Milan, and Rome. He was ordained a priest in 1594, and assigned to serve parishes in Cremona.  Travels In 1595, he received a letter appointing him to the missions in Japan. His journey was marked by shipwrecks and delays, which included his being detained in England.  He first left Italy on his way to Japan in December 1595 but reached his destination only in 1602, over six years later. The first ship he took from Genoa struck a rock and was forced to return to Genoa for repairs. Setting out again, he arrived in Barcelona and made his way on foot to Lisbon.  Spinola, with 7 other Jesuits, set sail from Lisbon on 10 April 1596 with the Portuguese India fleet, bound for Goa. A violent storm damaged the ship's rudder and they were forced to make for Brazil, where they landed on 15 July. They stayed for five months while their ship was repaired, leaving on 12 December 1596, to return to Lisbon.  A severe storm damaged their ship again and they made for Puerto Rico, where they disembarked on 25 March 1597. The missionaries found the general state of morality among the Spanish sugar plantations deplorable, and Spinola considered their arrival providential. Based in San Juan, he and the small band of Jesuits preached and taught catechism, visiting outlying settlements. On one occasion, Spinola was nearly drowned when his horse lost its footing crossing a river.  In order to return to Lisbon, the group of Jesuits decided to split up among a number of Portuguese ships which set sail together from Puerto Rico on 21 August 1597. The fleet was soon dispersed in a storm. Spinola's ship was captured by an English ship off the Azores on 18 October and he, with his companion Jerome de Angelis, arrived in 'Arthmuth'  (Dartmouth), England, on 5 November.  The next day, his ship continued to its home port 'Atapson' (Topsham), six leagues from 'Arthmuth', where Spinola and de Angelis spent a month being looked after at the Captain's expense.  With the captain's help, they left 'Atapson' on 6 December in a small boat bound for France, but in a storm were swept back to the English coast, where they spent a further month in a different port.  At the beginning of January 1598, he and de Angelis found passage to Lisbon on a German merchant ship.  Spinola spent another year in Lisbon awaiting permission to resume his journey to Japan before setting out once again with the India fleet in the spring of 1599.  This time he had an easier journey, reaching Japan in May 1602 via Goa, Malacca and Macao.  Missionary activity in Japan and Martyrdom  Spinola studied Japanese in Macao before going to Miyako (Kyoto) where he was minister at the Jesuit College, and a teacher of mathematics and astronomy. For twelve years, he worked at ministering to the growing Christian community in Japan. In 1614, all foreign missionaries were banished so Spinola went into hiding, eluding capture for four years. After being arrested in 1618, he, together with Ambrose Fernandes and their catechist, John Chogoku, were imprisoned for four years in a birdcage-like confinement under harsh conditions.

Dr Benjamin Twist,"Dr Benjamin Twist is a recurring fictional character who appears in several films featuring comedian Will Hay, who portrays the character in all mediums.  Character history  Dr. Benjamin Twist is a bumbling, fraudulent but lovable science teacher of the (fictional) St. Michael's School, which forms the backdrop of the films he appears in. Twist's typical appearance was with a mortarboard at an angle on his head and a pince-nez on his nose, as he squinted in a bewildered way at his unruly pupils.  Appearances  Good Morning, Boys  Twist's first appearance was in the 1937 film Good Morning, Boys, in which he is presented as the laid-back headmaster of St. Michael's, a boys school for the sons of rich gentry, where he also teaches Science.  Initially, he turns a blind eye to the misbehaviour of the boys under his eye, and teaches the children using his method of Twisterism, which is somehow related to Astrology and the signs of the Zodiac. However, he is later ordered by the school's new governor to adopt stricter policies, eventually turning St. Michael's into a military academy, with Twist holding an officer's rank.  Hey! Hey! USA!  Benjamin Twist appeared again in Hay's next film, Hey! Hey! USA! (1938). In this film, however, Twist is working as a porter aboard an oceangoing liner travelling between England and the United States, and during one particular voyage, he is mistaken for a scientist known as Prof. Tavistock by American gangster Bugs Leary (Edgar Kennedy), eventually becoming embroiled in a gangster plot to blackmail an American millionaire.  It is possible that Hey! Hey! USA! portrayed events that took place those before Good Morning, Boys, explaining Twist's sudden change from teacher to steward, and the absence of St. Michael's School.  Convict 99  Benjamin Twist's final appearance in the Will Hay films was in the 1938 film Convict 99, which was released shortly after Hey! Hey! USA!. In this film, Twist is dismissed from St. Michaels for incompetence, and whilst attending a job interview for a position in another school, he is mistaken for Australian disciplinarian John D. Benjamin (Roy Emerton), and accidentally accepts the post of governor of Blackdown Prison in Devon (possibly based on the real-life Dartmoor Prison), where he befriends prison-warden Albert (Graham Moffatt) and inmate Jerry ""The Mole"" (Moore Marriott).  Other appearances  A precursor of the Benjamin Twist character was Dr Alec Smart in Boys Will Be Boys (1935), who was an otherwise identical teaching character.  In The Ghost of St. Michael's (1941) the bumbling-teacher character has changed to William Lamb, but the character still bears similarities in appearance and manner to Benjamin Twist.

"Run, hide, tell","Run, hide, tell is a simple technique used for public security in the United Kingdom in the event of a firearms- or weapons-based terrorist attack. It was introduced by the Metropolitan Police Service in 2017.  The three elements of the advice are: Run to a place of safety. This is a far better option than to surrender or negotiate. If there's nowhere to go, then... Hide – It's better to hide than to confront. Remember to turn your phone to silent and turn off vibrate. Barricade yourself in if you can. Then finally and only when it is safe to do so... Tell the police by calling 999.

Confederacy (British political group),"The Confederacy was a society within the British Conservative Party that enthusiastically promoted Joseph Chamberlain's campaign for Tariff Reform. A founder of the society, Henry Page Croft, later wrote that ""It was started by three or four of us who held the view that nothing was worth fighting for except Chamberlain's battle, and we determined to do our best to drive the enemies of tariff reform out of the Conservative Party"".  It was a secret society in order, according to Croft, ""to appear much more important than we in fact were. Our idea was to endeavour to get large numbers of young men drawn from the aristocracy and country gentlemen who would devote themselves to the cause and fight constituencies wherever and whenever they were required"". At their height they numbered around 50 members, with 30 entering Parliament, 9 gaining office and 4 becoming Cabinet ministers. Sir Arthur Steel-Maitland was a member. Edward Goulding was closely connected with the Confederacy.  The first meetings were held at Fanhams Hall. The organisational skills of Thomas Comyn Platt and others ensured the Confederacy received national attention in the press and elsewhere.

Two Against the World (1932 film),"Two Against the World is a 1932 American pre-Code drama film directed by Archie Mayo and starring Constance Bennett as a woman who tries her best to keep her sister and brother out of trouble. It is based on the play A Dangerous Set by Marion Dix and Jerry Horwin.  The film, as well as Unashamed (1932), is based on a Philadelphia society murder by Eddie Allen, who killed Francis Donaldson III in an ""honor killing"".  Plot Lawyer Dave Norton offers a settlement for the destitute family of a man killed while working for the Hamilton family firm. The upper-class, wealthy Hamiltons gather to decide what to do. They all either vote to fight it in court or, in many cases, simply ignore it. ""Dell"" Hamilton is an irresponsible socialite who does the latter. However, she and Dave are attracted to each other, despite their very different philosophies of life. He takes her to lunch, and she invites him to an elegant party.  At the party, he receives a cold reception from the rest of the family, who consider him far beneath them, but he astonishes them when it is revealed that his family belongs to their own social class. Bob, Adele's drunkard brother, remains hostile, however, and lies, telling Dave that Dell invited him only to make a fool of him. Dave storms out.  The next day, Dell interrupts an unhappy meeting at Dave's office. She overhears Dave tell his client, Mrs. Polansky, that the Hamiltons' lawyers can postpone the case indefinitely. When the client wonders who will feed her hungry children, Dell gives her $100 and promises her the same every month for as long as the case takes.  One night, Vic Linley wins a great deal of money from Bob. When Dell pleads with Vic to go easy on her brother, he reveals that he is interested in her, having just broken off an affair with her married sister Corinne. Later, Bob finds a vanity case with the Hamilton family seal under a pillow in Vic's bedroom. He assumes it belongs to Dell (rather than Corinne).  When he accuses Dell, she pretends it is true in order to protect her sister. Furious and drunk, Bob goes back to Vic's place. Dell chases after him, but is too late. Bob shoots and kills Vic in the elevator. The siblings quickly leave the scene.  Unaware that Bob is the killer, District Attorney Mills agrees to keep the Hamilton name out of the scandal, but public opinion and newspaper reporter Segall will not let the case be forgotten. Blaming Dave for the uproar, Mills forces the lawyer to take over the case as a newly appointed deputy district attorney by threatening to ruin his career. Dell, however, believes he took the job to further his ambitions.  By bad luck, the doorman recognizes Dell when she leaves Dave's office, and she is put on trial. When she is called to the witness stand, however, Dave cannot bring himself to cross examine her too closely and accepts her unconvincing story. However, the doorman catches her in a lie, and the truth mostly comes out (except for Corinne's part in it). Bob is acquitted for defending his sister's honor, and Dell and Dave get back together.

"Chausath Yogini Temple, Ranipur Jharial","Chausath Yogini Temple of Ranipur Jharial in Balangir District, Odisha, is one of the circular, open air Yogini temples of India, dedicated to the 64 Yoginis. It appears to be an early temple from soon after 900 AD, and the presence of other temples indicates that it was an important site at that time. The surviving central shrine holds an image of dancing Shiva; all the Yogini images are, uniquely, similarly shown dancing.  Temple  The Chausath Yogini Temple, built in the 9th or 10th century in Ranipur-Jharial, in an isolated position some miles from the towns of Titilagarh and Kantabanjhi in Balangir district, Odisha, is a circular, hypaethral, 64-yogini temple made of sandstone, some 50 feet in diameter. 62 of the yogini images survive. The site, on an outcrop of rock, must have been important, given the presence of a large temple built of brick and several small temples of stone. The primary entrance is an opening in the circular wall towards the east; unlike at the Hirapur yogini temple, there was once a further opening towards the south, now filled in.  Ranipur-Jharial was the first of the Yogini temples to be discovered; it was described by Major-General John Campbell in 1853.  Shrine to Shiva and Chamunda  At the centre of the temple is the original shrine with four pillars, holding an image of Nateshwar, Shiva as Lord of Dance. The Shiva images is three-faced and eight-armed, and is depicted with urdhva linga, an erection. Elephant-headed Ganesh and the bull Nandi are shown in the image's base. The similar-sized image of the goddess Chamunda in the temple may once have been housed with Shiva in the central shrine.  Yogini images  The Ranipur Jharial Yoginis are made, like the temple walls, of a low-quality coarse sandstone, which has weathered poorly; they were once finely-carved. Uniquely, all the Yogini images are depicted poised about to dance, in the karana pose of Indian classical dance; Vidya Dehejia explains that the posture is taken up at the start of each group of movements. Like the Hirapur temple, but unlike other Yogini temples, there are no Matrikas, mother goddesses, among the Yoginis. 14 of the Yoginis are animal-headed; among them can be seen goddesses with the heads of a cat, an elephant, a snake, a horse, a buffalo, an antelope, and seemingly also of a leopard and a sow. The leopard-headed goddess is holding up a human corpse, suggestive of the corpse rituals (shava sadhana) of the Yogini cult. The absence of haloes or attendant figures as at later Yogini temples suggests that this temple was built relatively early.  The 19th century archaeologist Alexander Cunningham described two further Yogini images. One, uniquely, had the attributes of the Sun-god, Surya; she had two arms, a lotus flower in each hand, and seven horses. The other (now surviving only from the knees down) was dancing on a reclining male; she had 6 or 8 arms, and was depicted pulling her mouth open wide; she held a skull-cup, a kettle-drum, and a sword.

Kalai Kovil,"Kalai Kovil () is a 1964 Indian Tamil-language musical film written and directed by C. V. Sridhar. The film stars S. V. Subbaiah, R. Muthuraman, Chandrakantha and Rajasree, with Nagesh, V. Gopalakrishnan, V. S. Raghavan, Jayanthi and S. N. Lakshmi in supporting roles. It focuses on the rags to riches story of a veena vidwan, whose success is almost derailed when he takes to liquor abuse.  Kalai Kovil was produced under the banner Bhagyalakshmi Productions by M. S. Viswanathan (using the name Visu) and Ganga. Viswanathan also composed the film's soundtrack with T. K. Ramamoorthy under the name Viswanathan–Ramamoorthy, and Ganga also served as the art director. Sridhar's frequent collaborator Chitralaya Gopu served as the film's assistant dialogue writer.  Kalai Kovil was released on 25 September 1964 and received positive reviews from critics for its music, cast performances, writing and direction by Sridhar. It was not commercially successful, but the song ""Thangaratham Vanthathu"", performed by P. Susheela and M. Balamuralikrishna, attained popularity.  Plot   An impoverished man rises from rags to riches by becoming a veena vidwan, but almost loses it in the lap of a danseuse and the lavishness of liquor.  Cast   Male cast S. V. Subbaiah R. Muthuraman Nagesh V. Gopalakrishnan V. S. Raghavan  Female cast Chandrakantha Rajasree Jayanthi S. N. Lakshmi  Production  After the success of Kadhalikka Neramillai (1964), its producer and director C. V. Sridhar decided to make his next directorial venture based on the life of a musician. His frequent collaborator, writer Chitralaya Gopu met up with him at Marina Beach to discuss their next project which he wanted to be a comedy, but Sridhar told him to listen to the story he already finished writing, the story that became the film Kalai Kovil. Gopu was assigned as the film's assistant dialogue writer. After listening to the story, music composer M. S. Viswanathan decided to produce the film along with Ganga under the banner Bhagyalakshmi Productions. Ganga also worked as the art director, while Viswanathan was billed as ""Visu"" for his role as producer in the posters and opening credits. Cinematography was handled by Balu, and editing by N. M. Shankar. Chitti Babu played the veena offscreen for Muthuraman.  Soundtrack   The soundtrack was composed by Viswanathan–Ramamoorthy (a duo consisting of M. S. Viswanathan and T. K. Ramamoorthy) and the lyrics were penned by Kannadasan. The song ""Deviyar Iruvar"" is set in the carnatic raga known as Shree, while ""Thangaratham Vanthathu"" is set in Abhogi. Shyam was the violinist of the latter song, which attained popularity.  Release and reception  Kalai Kovil was released on 25 September 1964. The film received positive reviews from critics who praised the music, performances of the cast, the screenplay, dialogues and direction by Sridhar. On 2 October 1964, The Indian Express praised the first half, but criticised the second half, saying the film maintained a ""richly musical and at times absorbing"" tone till the second half, when ""scripter-director Sridhar's hands, like that of the hero in the movie, begin to slip"". The reviewer called the songs composed by Viswanathan–Ramamoorthy ""a delight to the ears"", but felt they did not exploit the veena, ""the very soul of the film"", fully. They also lauded Balu's cinematography, Ganga's art direction and the performances of Subbaiah and Nagesh, saying they ""try to salvage the film, but in vain"". The film was commercially unsuccessful.

He grew up listening to music from all over the world including American soul music such as James Brown & Aretha Franklin which he listened to at home via radio broadcasts or records bought by his parents.   His first musical experience came when aged four years old singing along to songs sung by his mother's operatic friends during their rehearsals.    At age eight Chris began playing guitar after receiving one as Christmas present from his grandfather.   By eleven years old he had formed his own group called ""The Blackbirds"" where they performed covers of popular bands like Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple and Rolling Stones amongst others.   In 1967 he joined another local band called ""Spike Jones"" before joining the ""Strangers"" later that year.   During this time he also attended art school studying painting but left without completing it due to lack of interest.   After leaving art college he worked briefly as a waiter/barman until being offered work as a roadie for the Stranglers' touring crew.

Garden designer,"A garden designer is someone who designs the plan and features of gardens, either as an amateur or professional. The compositional elements of garden design and landscape design are: terrain, water, planting, constructed elements and buildings, paving, site characteristics and genius loci, and the local climatic qualities.  Services Garden designers are skilled specialists dealing with master planning of landscapes and design of gardens, consulting with advice for clients, providing direction and supervision during construction, and the management of establishment and maintenance once the garden has been created. They are able to survey the site, and prepare drawings for the development of a garden from concepts to construction, and source the plant and building materials. Historically, many gardens have been designed by talented amateurs without formal training, and many others have been designed by people whose artistic or design training was not originally focused on gardens. The complexities in contemporary environmental design issues and technology increase the scope professional garden designers fill.  Methods  A wide range of design methods have been used by garden designers, depending partly on the historical period in which they worked and partly on the professional discipline with which they have the closest relationship. One can, for example, speak of an ""architect's garden"", ""artist's garden"" or a ""plantsman's garden"". Treating the subject historically, one can say that ancient gardens were likely to have been ""drawn"" directly on the ground, that Renaissance gardens were drawn on paper and that modern gardens are drawn on a computer. The design process always has an influence on the design product.  There tends to be a distinction between those designers who start with the plant palette and its needs, called garden design; and those designers who begin with consideration of the space and place-making to create architectural spaces and circulation routes with plants and other elements, called landscape design. Many famous gardens which contain many interesting plants can be incompletely planned as a whole and integrated composition. Also, many gardens which are well planned in overall design can lack the interests from planting detail. Some keen gardeners who are very knowledgeable about plants can be resistant to conceptualizing design. Some very competent designers and landscape architects have a meager amount of diverse botanical and horticultural knowledge and experience. A competent and talented garden designer can synthesize both needs to design sand create beautiful and sustainable landscapes and gardens.  Garden design education Historically, garden designers were trained under the apprentice system, such as André Le Nôtre with his father and Beatrix Farrand with Charles Sprague Sargent. Specialist university-level landscape planning and garden design courses were established in the twentieth century, generally attached to departments of agriculture, horticulture, or architecture. In the second half of the twentieth century many of these courses changed their scale of focus and their nomenclature, from garden design to landscape architecture. Towards the end of the twentieth century a number of BA garden design curricula were established with the emphasis more on design than horticulture. Horticultural colleges, in ornamental horticulture departments, and architecture colleges, in landscape architecture departments, continue to train contemporary garden designers.

Lin Dunn,"Lin Dunn (born May 10, 1947) is an American women's basketball coach, currently a special assistant to the head coach with Kentucky. She is most known for being the first coach and general manager for the Seattle Storm. She has more than 500 wins to her name.  A native of Dresden, Tennessee, Dunn graduated from the University of Tennessee at Martin in 1969. She coached for decades in the college ranks, amassing a 447-257 record in 25 seasons as a college head coach. In her tenure at Austin Peay State University (1970–1976), the University of Mississippi (1977–1978), the University of Miami (1978–1987) and Purdue University (1987–1996), she made the NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship seven times, and the Final Four once, in 1994 with Purdue. She is in the Athletics Hall of Fame at both Austin Peay and Miami. Dunn also was president of the Women's Basketball Coaches Association in 1984-85.  Dunn was abruptly fired at Purdue after the 1995-96 season, but resurfaced in the pros with the American Basketball League's Portland Power in 1996. She was ABL's coach of the year in 1998, right before that league folded. Dunn then became the first coach and GM of the expansion Seattle Storm in the ABL's rival, the WNBA. Her folksy southern personality was a hit in Urbane, Seattle, with fans often wearing Dunn masks and quoting her rustic aphorisms. The team started with a dismal 6-26 season.  Dunn left the Storm just as it was starting to have success. New superstars Lauren Jackson and Sue Bird led the team to the 2002 playoffs, where they were swept by the Los Angeles Sparks. Dunn then resigned, leaving the path open for Anne Donovan to build a championship team just two seasons later.  Dunn is a former head coach of the Indiana Fever. Dunn won the WNBA championship with the Fever on October 21, 2012.  On May 6, 2014, Dunn announced her retirement from coaching at the end of the year.  On June 14, 2014; Dunn was inducted into the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame.  On May 24, 2016, she was introduced as an assistant coach for Matthew Mitchell at Kentucky. On May 26, 2017, UK Athletics announced that Coach Dunn had signed a one-year contract extension.  In 2018, her role at Kentucky changed to special assistant to the head coach.  USA Basketball  In 1990, Dunn was the assistant coach for the USA National team at the World Championships in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The team, behind the 22 point per game scoring of Teresa Edwards, won all eight contests, with only the win over Cuba decided by single digits. The USA team faced Yugoslavia in the gold medal game, and won 88–78.  In 1995, Dunn served as the head coach to the R. William Jones Cup Team. The competition was held in Taipei, Taiwan. The USA team won its first six games, but four of the six were won by single-digit margins. Their seventh game was against Russia, and they fell 100–84. The final game was against South Korea, and a victory would assure the gold medal, but the South Korean team won 80–76 to win the gold medal. The USA team won the bronze medal.

I Am Not an Easy Man,"I Am Not an Easy Man (French: Je ne suis pas un homme facile) is a 2018 French romantic comedy directed by Éléonore Pourriat. The film stars Vincent Elbaz as a chauvinist who ends up in a parallel universe where stereotypical gender roles are reversed. The film was released worldwide on April 13, 2018, by Netflix. It is the second French-language Netflix original film (after Blockbuster) and the first French-language film commissioned by Netflix.  Synopsis Damien is a shameless chauvinist who has all the benefits of living in a patriarchal society. After a bump to the head, Damien passes out. When he wakes up, he finds himself in what seems to be an alternate universe where gender roles are reversed and women have the power. Damien feels confused: now that he experiences sexism he struggles to find his place in this foreign new world. He meets and seduces Alexandra, an influential novelist who is herself a chauvinist.  Cast  Vincent Elbaz as Damien  Marie-Sophie Ferdane as Alexandra  Pierre Bénézit as Christophe  Blanche Gardin as Sybille  Céline Menville as Lolo  Christele Tual as Annie  Moon Dailly as Alexandra's coach  Camille Landru-Girardet as Ludovic  Production The film finds its origins in Oppressed Majority (French: Majorité opprimée), a 2010 short film directed by Pourriat, about a stay-at-home dad who experiences sexism in a parallel, female-dominated world, and eventually becomes the victim of sexual assault. In 2014, after being released on video-sharing platform YouTube with English-language subtitles, the short garnered international attention and Pourriat was approached by Netflix to develop a new, larger project based on the initial premise. Pourriat initially wanted to make a series, but she eventually reached an agreement with Netflix to produce a feature-length romantic comedy with the help of producers Eleonore Dailly and Edouard de Lachomette.  The film premiered on Netflix on April 13, 2018. In accordance with French laws on digital film distribution, the film was not scheduled for theatrical release in France, in order to be immediately available online. Pierre Bénézit, the lead actor in Oppressed Majority, played the supporting character Christophe in I Am Not an Easy Man.

"The Grange, Windsor","The Grange is a heritage-listed detached house at 38 Crowther Street, Windsor, City of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. It was built from  to 1877. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  This small brick house appears to have been constructed  as a family home for Lutwyche brickmaker William Williams, who in that year acquired 9 hectares of land at Lutwyche, including the house site, from Brisbane businessman Nehemiah Bartley. The kitchen was erected in 1877 by contractor John William Young for £69/10/-, being labour only.  Williams was associated with the development of Lutwyche as Brisbane's principal brickmaking district in the 1870s and 1880s, and it is likely that the bricks for his own house and kitchen were supplied from the brickworks on his Lutwyche property. Although Williams had arrived in Queensland from England by early 1864 and was at Lutwyche in 1865, he does not appear to have commenced brickmaking until the 1870s. Some of the first bricks produced by him were used in construction of the Old Government Printery), erected in 1874. By 1888 Williams owned four brickyards, including the Milton Brickworks on River Road at Toowong, and was producing the highest per annum output of bricks in the Lutwyche area. Mrs Williams managed the business from , and Williams and his son William, worked two of the brickyards themselves.  Following Williams' death in the early 1890s, the freehold passed to his widow, who sold the house in 1904. The land has been subdivided since, but the house remains a family home.  Fullers Street at Lutwyche was originally named Williams Street, after the early brickmaker and his family, and nearby Brickfield Street recalls the brickmaking enterprise which Williams established at Lutwyche in the 1870s.  Description   The Grange, located on the crest of a rise at the southwest corner of Crowther and Fuller streets, consists of a residence fronting Crowther Street to the east with a detached kitchen house to the west.  The residence is a single-storeyed rendered masonry structure with an attic and corrugated iron gable roof. The building has verandahs to four sides with curved corrugated iron awnings, timber posts with shaped brackets and brick paving. Timber sash windows have been built to match early windows in the kitchen house, and timber front and rear doors are later additions.  Internally, the building has four rooms with fireplaces to both north rooms and a central entry to the east and west. The northeast room has cedar cupboards either side of the fireplace and the northwest room has an early timber staircase to the attic. The floor consists of a recent  concrete slab laid over sand on a bed of original brick bats. Walls are lime plastered with horse hair, and have original concrete skirting. Internal timber doors are not original. The attic has a recent ensuite at the north end, and a single Velux roof window has been inserted on the southwestern side.  The kitchen house is a single-storeyed masonry structure, partly rendered, with a corrugated iron gable roof. The building has a verandah to the west with a corrugated iron awning, timber posts and brick paving, and early timber doors and sash windows.  Internally, the building is a single room with a fireplace at the north end, a recent timber floor and limewash finish to the walls. A single Velux roof window has been inserted on the eastern side.  A weatherboard boathouse/living area with a corrugated iron gable roof has been added to the northwest of the kitchen house, and a later weatherboard bunkhouse with a hipped corrugated iron roof has been added to the southwest.  A timber pigeon coop is located in the northwest corner of the site, and a timber picket fence surrounds the eastern side of the residence.  Heritage listing  The Grange was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria.  The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.  The Grange is important in demonstrating the 19th century development of Windsor-Lutwyche as a brick-making district, and is significant as a rare surviving brick, gable-style artisan's home of the 1870s, which offers rare surviving evidence of 1870s brick construction in Brisbane.

Luis Redondo,"Luis Rolando Redondo Guifarro (born 20 January 1973 in Tegucigalpa) is a Honduran politician and engineer, serving as deputy and president of the National Congress of Honduras since 25 January 2022.  Early life and career  Reondo began as a businessman in San Pedro Sula. He got involved supporting the Honduran National Team, traveling everywhere they played, becoming head of the barra since 2004. In that same year he met Salvador Nasralla, with whom he began a friendship. He traveled to the 2010 and 2014 World Cups, along with the national team. In 2011, he supported Nasralla for the creation of the Anti-Corruption Party and, in turn, became a candidate for deputy to Congress, in the 2013 election, in which he was elected.  Presidential dispute  In 2016, a crisis began within the Anti-Corruption Party with Nasralla being accused of being ""badly advised"" which led to a dispute between Nasralla and Marlene Alvarenga about which of them would become the party's presidential candidate, the latter winning the dispute, while Nasralla would be appointed as the LIBRE-PINU presidential candidate. Redondo left PAC and joined PINU to run for Congress, being elected.  Congressional president and leadership dispute  In October 2021, the presidential candidates for PSH and LIBRE, Salvador Nasralla and Xiomara Castro, respectively, struck an alliance. Part of the agreement for Nasralla to step down as a candidate and endorse Castro was that if they were able to gain a majority in Congress, the speaker would be a member of the Savior Party. Castro's party won 50 seats, whilst Nasralla's party won 10. On December 23, during a livestream, Nasralla announced his endorsement for Luis Redondo to become the President of the Congress. The next morning, Castro followed suit. When the newly elected congress voted for a congressional president on 21 January 2022, 18 deputies from Castro's party refused to honour the agreement. Instead, they voted for Jorge Cálix, a member of LIBRE, rather than Redondo. Nasralla commented on the incident as ""another coup like in 2009"". As a consequence, the 18 deputies were expelled from LIBRE. The dispute was resolved when Cálix and the expelled deputies agreed to support Redondo. Their membership of LIBRE was restored by Castro.

Opening sentence,"At the beginning of a written work stands the opening sentence or opening line.  The opening line is part or all of the opening sentence that may start the lead paragraph. For older texts the Latin term ""incipit"" (it begins) is in use for the very first words of the opening sentence.  As in speech, a personal document such as a letter normally starts with a salutation; this, however, tends not to be the case in documents, articles, essays, poetry, lyrics, and general works of fiction and nonfiction. In nonfiction, the opening sentence generally points the reader to the subject under discussion directly in a matter-of-fact style. In journalism, the opening line typically sets out the scope of the article.  In fiction, authors have much liberty in the way they can cast the beginning. Techniques to hold the reader's attention include keeping the opening sentence to the point, showing attitude, shocking, and being controversial. One of the most famous opening lines, ""It was the best of times, it was the worst of times ..."", starts a sentence of 118 words that draws the reader in by its contradiction; the first sentence of Yes even contains 477 words. ""Call me Ishmael"" is an example of a short opening sentence. Formulaic openings are generally eschewed, but expected in certain genres, such as fairy tales beginning ""Once upon a time..."".  Inspired by the opening, ""It was a dark and stormy night..."", the annual tongue-in-cheek Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest invites entrants to compose ""the opening sentence of the worst of all possible novels"", and its derivative, the Lyttle Lytton Contest, for its equivalent in brevity.  The opening sentence may sometimes be also used as the title for the work, e.g. Everything I Possess I Carry With Me; papal encyclicals and bulls are titled according to their incipits.

Further work in 1988 at the GSI measured EC and SF branchings in 254No. In 1989, the FLNR used the reaction to measure SF decay characteristics for the two isomers of 254No. The measurement of the 2n excitation function was reported in 2001 by Yuri Oganessian at the FLNR.  Patin et al. at the LBNL reported in 2002 the synthesis of 255–251No in the 1-4n exit channels and measured further decay data for these isotopes.  The reaction has recently been used at the Jyvaskylan Yliopisto Fysiikan Laitos (JYFL) using the RITU set-up to study K-isomerism in 254No. The scientists were able to measure two K-isomers with half-lives of 275 ms and 198 s, respectively. They were assigned to 8− and 16+ K-isomeric levels.  The reaction was used in 2004–5 at the FLNR to study the spectroscopy of 255–253No. The team were able to confirm an isomeric level in 253No with a half-life of 43.5 s.  208Pb(44Ca,xn)252−xNo (x=2) This reaction was studied in 2003 at the FLNR in a study of the spectroscopy of 250No.  207Pb(48Ca,xn)255−xNo (x=2) The measurement of the 2n excitation function for this reaction was reported in 2001 by Yuri Oganessian and co-workers at the FLNR. The reaction was used in 2004–5 to study the spectroscopy of 253No.  206Pb(48Ca,xn)254−xNo (x=1,2,3,4) The measurement of the 1-4n excitation functions for this reaction were reported in 2001 by Yuri Oganessian and co-workers at the FLNR. The 2n channel was further studied by the GSI to provide a spectroscopic determination of K-isomerism in 252No. A K-isomer with spin and parity 8− was detected with a half-life of 110 ms.  204Pb(48Ca,xn)252−xNo (x=2,3) The measurement of the 2n excitation function for this reaction was reported in 2001 by Yuri Oganessian at the FLNR. They reported a new isotope 250No with a half-life of 36 μs. The reaction was used in 2003 to study the spectroscopy of 250No.They were able to observe two spontaneous fission activities with half-lives of 5.6 μs and 54 μs and assigned to 250No and 249No, respectively. The latter activity was later assigned to a K-isomer in 250No. The reaction was reported in 2006 by Peterson et al. at the Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) in a study of SF in 250No. They detected two activities with half-lives of 3.7  μs and 43  μs and both assigned to 250No, the latter associated with a K-isomer. In 2020, a team at FLNR repeated this reaction and found a new 9.1-MeV alpha particle activity correlated to 245Fm and 241Cf, which they assigned to the new isotope 249No.  By hot fusion 232Th(26Mg,xn)258−xNo (x=4,5,6) The cross sections for the 4-6n exit channels have been measured for this reaction at the FLNR.  238U(22Ne,xn)260−xNo (x=4,5,6) This reaction was first studied in 1964 at the FLNR. The team were able to detect decays from 252Fm and 250Fm. The 252Fm activity was associated with an ~8 s half-life and assigned to 256102 from the 4n channel, with a yield of 45 nb.   They were also able to detect a 10 s spontaneous fission activity also tentatively assigned to 256102. Further work in 1966 on the reaction examined the detection of 250Fm decay using chemical separation and a parent activity with a half-life of ~50 s was reported and correctly assigned to 254102. They also detected a 10 s spontaneous fission activity tentatively assigned to 256102. The reaction was used in 1969 to study some initial chemistry of nobelium at the FLNR. They determined eka-ytterbium properties, consistent with nobelium as the heavier homologue. In 1970, they were able to study the SF properties of 256No. In 2002, Patin et al. reported the synthesis of 256No from the 4n channel but were unable to detect 257No.  The cross section values for the 4-6n channels have also been studied at the FLNR.  238U(20Ne,xn)258−xNo This reaction was studied in 1964 at the FLNR. No spontaneous fission activities were observed.  236U(22Ne,xn)258−xNo (x=4,5,6) The cross sections for the 4-6n exit channels have been measured for this reaction at the FLNR.  235U(22Ne,xn)257−xNo (x=5) This reaction was studied in 1970 at the FLNR. It was used to study the SF decay properties of 252No.  233U(22Ne,xn)255−xNo The synthesis of neutron deficient nobelium isotopes was studied in 1975 at the FLNR. In their experiments they observed a 250 s SF activity, which they tentatively assigned to 250No in the 5n exit channel. Later results have not been able to confirm this activity and it is currently unidentified.  242Pu(18O,xn)260−xNo (x=4?) This reaction was studied in 1966 at the FLNR. The team identified an 8.2 s SF activity tentatively assigned to 256102.  241Pu(16O,xn)257−xNo This reaction was first studied in 1958 at the FLNR. The team measured ~8.8 MeV alpha particles with a half-life of 30 s and assigned to 253,252,251102. A repeat in 1960 produced 8.9 MeV alpha particles with a half-life of 2–40 s and assigned to 253102 from the 4n channel. Confidence in these results was later diminished.  239Pu(18O,xn)257−xNo (x=5) This reaction was studied in 1970 at the FLNR in an effort to study the SF decay properties of 252No.  239Pu(16O,xn)255−xNo This reaction was first studied in 1958 at the FLNR. The team were able to measure ~8.8 MeV alpha particles with a half-life of 30 s and assigned to253,252,251102. A repeat in 1960 was unsuccessful and it was concluded the first results were probably associated with background effects.  243Am(15N,xn)258−xNo (x=4) This reaction was studied in 1966 at the FLNR. The team were able to detect 250Fm using chemical techniques and determined an associated half-life significantly higher than the reported 3 s by Berkeley for the supposed parent 254No. Further work later the same year measured 8.1 MeV alpha particles with a half-life of 30–40 s.  243Am(14N,xn)257−xNo This reaction was studied in 1966 at the FLNR. They were unable to detect the 8.1 MeV alpha particles detected when using a N-15 beam.  241Am(15N,xn)256−xNo (x=4) The decay properties of 252No were examined in 1977 at Oak Ridge. The team calculated a half-life of 2.3 s and measured a 27% SF branching.  248Cm(18O,αxn)262−xNo (x=3) The synthesis of the new isotope 259No was reported in 1973 from the LBNL using this reaction.  248Cm(13C,xn)261−xNo (x=3?,4,5) This reaction was first studied in 1967 at the LBNL. The new isotopes 258No,257No and 256No were detected in the 3-5n channels. The reaction was repeated in 1970 to provide further decay data for 257No.  248Cm(12C,xn)260−xNo (4,5?) This reaction was studied in 1967 at the LBNL in their seminal study of nobelium isotopes. The reaction was used in 1990 at the LBNL to study the SF of256No.  246Cm(13C,xn)259−xNo (4?,5?) This reaction was studied in 1967 at the LBNL in their seminal study of nobelium isotopes.  246Cm(12C,xn)258−xNo (4,5) This reaction was studied in 1958 by scientists at the LBNL using a 5% 246Cm curium target. They were able to measure 7.43 MeV decays from250Fm, associated with a 3 s 254No parent activity, resulting from the 4n channel. The 3 s activity was later reassigned to 252No, resulting from reaction with the predominant 244Cm component in the target. It could however not be proved that it was not due to the contaminant250mFm, unknown at the time. Later work in 1959 produced 8.3 MeV alpha particles with a half-life of 3 s and a 30% SF branch. This was initially assigned to 254No and later reassigned to 252No, resulting from reaction with the 244Cm component in the target. The reaction was restudied in 1967 and activities assigned to 254No and 253No were detected.  244Cm(13C,xn)257−xNo (x=4) This reaction was first studied in 1957 at the Nobel Institute in Stockholm. The scientists detected 8.5 MeV alpha particles with a half-life of 10 minutes. The activity was assigned to 251No or 253No. The results were later dismissed as background. The reaction was repeated by scientists at the LBNL in 1958 but they were unable to confirm the 8.5 MeV alpha particles.  The reaction was further studied in 1967 at the LBNL and an activity assigned to 253No was measured.  244Cm(12C,xn)256−xNo (x=4,5) This reaction was studied in 1958 by scientists at the LBNL using a 95% 244Cm curium target. They were able to measure 7.43 MeV decays from250Fm, associated with a 3 s 254No parent activity, resulting from the reaction (246Cm,4n). The 3 s activity was later reassigned to252No, resulting from reaction (244Cm,4n). It could however not be proved that it was not due to the contaminant 250mFm, unknown at the time. Later work in 1959 produced 8.3 MeV alpha particles with a half-life of 3 s and a 30% SF branch. This was initially assigned to 254No and later reassigned to 252No, resulting from reaction with the 244Cm component in the target. The reaction was restudied in 1967 at the LBNL and a new activity assigned to 251No was measured.  252Cf(12C,αxn)260−xNo (x=3?) This reaction was studied at the LBNL in 1961 as part of their search for element 104. They detected 8.2 MeV alpha particles with a half-life of 15 s. This activity was assigned to a Z=102 isotope. Later work suggests an assignment to 257No, resulting most likely from the α3n channel with the 252Cf component of the californium target.  252Cf(11B,pxn)262−xNo (x=5?) This reaction was studied at the LBNL in 1961 as part of their search for element 103. They detected 8.2 MeV alpha particles with a half-life of 15 s. This activity was assigned to a Z=102 isotope. Later work suggests an assignment to 257No, resulting most likely from the p5n channel with the 252Cf component of the californium target.  249Cf(12C,αxn)257−xNo (x=2) This reaction was first studied in 1970 at the LBNL in a study of 255No. It was studied in 1971 at the Oak Ridge Laboratory. They were able to measure coincident Z=100 K X-rays from 255No, confirming the discovery of the element.  As decay products Isotopes of nobelium have also been identified in the decay of heavier elements. Observations to date are summarised in the table below:  Isotopes Twelve radioisotopes of nobelium have been characterized, with the most stable being 259No with a half-life of 58 minutes. Longer half-lives are expected for the as-yet-unknown 261No and 263No. An isomeric level has been found in 253No and K-isomers have been found in 250No, 252No and 254No to date.  Chronology of isotope discovery  Nuclear isomerism 254No The study of K-isomerism was recently studied by physicists at the University of Jyväskylä physics laboratory (JYFL). They were able to confirm a previously reported K-isomer and detected a second K-isomer. They assigned spins and parities of 8− and 16+ to the two K-isomers.  253No In 1971, Bemis et al. was able to determine an isomeric level decaying with a half-life of 31 s from the decay of 257Rf. This was confirmed in 2003 at the GSI by also studying the decay of 257Rf. Further support in the same year from the FLNR appeared with a slightly higher half-life of 43.5 s, decaying by M2 gamma emission to the ground state.  252No In a recent study by the GSI into K-isomerism in even-even isotopes, a K-isomer with a half-life of 110 ms was detected for 252No. A spin and parity of 8− was assigned to the isomer.  250No In 2003, scientists at the FLNR reported that they had been able to synthesise 249No, which decayed by SF with a half-life of 54 μs. Further work in 2006 by scientists at the ANL showed that the activity was actually due to a K-isomer in 250No. The ground state isomer was also detected with a very short half-life of 3.7 μs.  Chemical yields of isotopes  Cold fusion The table below provides cross-sections and excitation energies for cold fusion reactions producing nobelium isotopes directly. Data in bold represents maxima derived from excitation function measurements. + represents an observed exit channel.  Hot fusion The table below provides cross-sections and excitation energies for hot fusion reactions producing nobelium isotopes directly. Data in bold represents maxima derived from excitation function measurements. + represents an observed exit channel.  Retracted isotopes In 2003, scientists at the FLNR claimed to have discovered 249No, which would have been the lightest known isotope of nobelium. However, subsequent work showed that the 54 s activity was actually due to 250No and the isotope 249No was retracted. The discovery of this isotope was later reported in 2020; its decay properties differed from the 2003 claims.

Beeline (album),"Beeline is an album by American singer-songwriter Peter Case, released in 2002.  Critical reception  Writing for Allmusic, music critic Robert L. Doerschuk wrote ""The low-budget production suggests that at least one of the goals here is to maintain Case's credibility as an off-center artist. In the end, though, this only contributes to a derivative quality… there's little to distinguish Bee Line from more insightful, wry, and far brighter highlights in the Case catalog."" Writing for No Depression, David Menconi wrote of the album ""In many ways, Beeline represents Case’s niftiest balancing act to date, adding touches of psychedelic ragtime and exotic raga drones to his steady rolling country blues… Beeline is anything but a downer, although the stoicism is more implied than spelled out.""

After finishing 2014 ranked No. 1 nationally by both major polls (the AP Poll and Coaches' Poll), they were considered one of the favorites to win the 2015 BCS National Championship Game against Wisconsin on December 31, but lost 24–21 after being down 21–0 late in the third quarter.  The loss was the first time since 2002 that UM had failed to reach either the national championship game or bowl game as a top-ranked team.   They finished the regular season undefeated at 12-0 overall and 6-0 in Big East Conference play.    In addition to winning all six conference games, including two wins over then-No. 2 Villanova, the Hurricanes also won four non-conference games, defeating Georgia Tech twice, Notre Dame once, and North Carolina State once before losing to Clemson in the ACC/Big Ten Challenge semifinal round.   For the second consecutive year, head coach Al Golden's squad set numerous records throughout its run through the season; it became only the fourth program ever to have three players named All-Americans within five days, joining Oklahoma Sooners (in 1930), Texas Longhorns (in 1952) and Auburn Tigers (in 2005).

Yunnan box turtle,"The Yunnan box turtle (Cuora yunnanensis) is a species of turtle in the family Geoemydidae (formerly Bataguridae). It is believed to be  endemic to Yunnan, China (in Kunming and Huize) and was suspected to be extinct since the early 20th century; the last verified specimen was collected in 1940.  In 2004, a living female appeared from the pet trade in Kunming; one year later, a male from the same source and again one year later another female were found there. The validity of these specimens was doubted and many believed they were intentionally produced hybrids, a common technique in China to produce turtles that get high prices.  In 2007, He et al. sampled the three living specimens and gave the genetic proof that all three living specimens are indeed C. yunnanensis and not hybrids. In 2008, Kadoorie Conservation China, a department of Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden, together with the Kunming Institute of Zoology and Chinese Academy of Sciences, discovered a small wild population. The distribution of this species remains unclear, but due to its value, it is heavily sought after. Protection measures are needed to save this probably highly endangered species from its return onto the IUCN list of extinct animals.  References   Blanck, T., Zhou, T. & W. P.

Kim Jong-suk,"Kim Jong-suk (; 24 December 1917  – 22 September 1949) was a Korean anti-Japanese guerrilla, a Communist activist, North Korean leader Kim Il-sung's first wife, former leader Kim Jong-il's mother, and current leader Kim Jong-un's grandmother.  Biography Kim Jong-suk was born on 24 December 1917 in Hoeryong County, North Hamgyong Province, Japanese Korea. Suh Dae-sook writes that she was ""the elder of two daughters of a poor farmer."" However, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), states that she had a younger brother, Kim Ki-song(김기송), who was born 9 February 1921.  Kim Jong-suk followed her mother to Manchuria to look for her father, but they discovered that he had already died there. Soon after that, her mother died and she became an orphan. Most sources agree that Kim Jong-suk then joined Kim Il-sung’s guerrilla force in 1935 or 1936 as a kitchen helper.  The KCNA, however, reports that Kim Jong-suk and Kim Ki-song joined the guerrilla forces after their mother and their elder brother’s wife were murdered by the Japanese.  During this time, Kim Jong-suk worked various odd jobs, was arrested by the Japanese in 1937 in an undercover attempt to secure food and supplies. After her release, she rejoined the guerrillas, where she cooked, sewed, and washed.  It was around this time that Kim Jong-suk reportedly saved Kim Il-sung’s life. Baik Bong relates the story in Kim Il-sung's official biography:  Kim Jong-suk married Kim Il Sung in the Soviet Union, most likely in 1941. On 16 February 1941 (or 1942, sources vary), in the Soviet village of Vyatskoye, Kim Jong-suk had Kim Jong-il, who was given the Russian name ""Yuri Irsenovich Kim,"" and the nickname ""Yura."" In 1944, Kim Jong-suk had Kim Man-il, in Korean and ""Alexander"" or ""Shura"" in Russian. In 1946, she gave birth to a daughter, Kim Kyŏng-hŭi. Augustina Vardugina, a woman from Vyatskoye, was in her teens when Kim Il-sung's guerrilla group camped there. She remembers Kim Jong-suk, and how she would come to the village to barter military rations for chicken and eggs. Her son, Kim Jong-il, would be holding her hand.  A year after the establishment of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and until her death, Kim Jong-suk was the first lady of North Korea. According to some accounts, Kim Jong-suk ""was a small, quiet woman, not particularly well educated, but friendly and life-loving."" Major General N.G. Lebedev, an executive Soviet officer during the Soviet occupation of North Korea, recalled Kim Jong-suk as ""a vivacious and generous lady who always cooked enormous amounts of food for the hungry Soviet generals when they visited Kim’s home.""  Death  Kim Jong-suk died in Pyongyang in 1949. The official story is that she died from ""the hardships she had endured during the years as a guerrilla fighter."" The unofficial story is that she died in childbirth while delivering a stillborn child. Her death, however, is omitted from her official biography. Some say she died from tuberculosis, and there are other stories that she was shot and bled to death.  Legacy After Kim Jong-il succeeded Kim Il Sung, he began to make his mother, Kim Jong-suk, into ""a revolutionary immortal."" This campaign created ""a holy trinity known as the ‘Three Generals.’"" Instead of touting Kim Jong-suk as the quiet woman that she was, she became the heroine of the revolution. The website of the National Democratic Front of South Korea (NDFSK) says she was ""a peerless heroine . . . an anti-Japanese heroine . . . a faithful retainer who faithfully carried out General Kim Il Sung’s [Kim Il-sung] will but also a lifeguard who safeguarded the General of every dangerous movement.""  Kim Jong-suk was recorded to have ""conducted on-the-spot guidance sessions"" and was a ""great strategist"". In her home town of Hoeryong, ""a museum, a library, a statue, a square and the house in which she was born"" are ""devoted to the 'Mother of Korea'"". She arranged parachute training and won several shooting competitions. One story says that she would wash Kim Il-sung's socks and dry them in her bosom, or cut her hair and spread it in Kim Il-sung's shoes.  Michael Harrold, in his memoir Comrades and Strangers, relates several stories he heard about Kim Jong-suk while in North Korea. According to him, there is a memorial near Mount Kumgang that marks where Kim Jong-suk stopped ""when she realized she had forgotten to bring the great leader’s lunch, and had turned back to prepare something to eat for when he returned from the mountains."" Kim Jong-suk is also credited with inspiring Kim Jong-il to build the Ryugyong Hotel. Harrold relates that Kim Jong-suk told a young Kim Jong-il that he ""must build tall buildings for the people, of 30 or even 40 stories,"" and the son replied that he would build housing 100 stories high.

Life Khunza Humayun Begum was married to sultan Hussain Nizam Shah I. She became the mother of Murtaza Nizam Shah I.  In 1565, she was widowed, and her son ascended to the throne. As her son was a minor, a regency was appointed to rule, and she became his regent. She was described as a distinguished person of ability, talent and virtues. She appointed first Qasim Beg Tabrezi, then Maulana Inayatullah to the post of Wakil and Peshwa, but they could not come to terms with her, and she finally appointed her three brothers Taj Khan, Ain -ul-Mulk and Itibar Khan to share the office.  She conducted a war against Bijapur in alliance with Venkatadari of Penukonda and Ibrahim Qutb Shah, which however ended in defeat. She conducted a second war in alliance with Tufal Khan against Bijapur, which also ended in defeat.  Her rule was unpopular because of her military failures and her favoritism of her relations. Her unpopularity came to a crucial point when the kingdom was invaded by Ali Adil Shah in 1569, who conquered Kondana and established the fort Dharur there.  In 1569, there was a first attempt to have her deposed from regency and her son declared of legal majority. Her son's Quran tutor Maulana Husain Tabrezi convinced her son to allow him to hire ruffians seize and depose her. However, her son changed his mind and alerted his mother, and the conspirators, among them Khwaja Mirak Dabir and Sayyid Murtaza, fled to Alia Adil Shah. She later pardoned them.  She and her son left for an expedition to inspect the encroachments of Kishwar Khan Lari. Two Nizam Shahi officers convinced her son to send Habsh Khan to inform his mother that ""it was his pleasure that she should no longer engage in public affairs"", and that she should retire to purdah like the other princesses.  As a response, she mounted a horse and armed herself with a bow and sword and dagger arrest the conspirators. She was however defeated by Habsh Khan, who succeeded in having her arrested. Her brothers fled to avoid being arrested by Khwaja Mirak. She was deposed in a coup by her son, who declared himself of majority with the support of the Nizam Shahi nobility.

Convergence of measures,"In mathematics, more specifically measure theory, there are various notions of the convergence of measures. For an intuitive general sense of what is meant by convergence in measure, consider a sequence of measures μn on a space, sharing a common collection of measurable sets. Such a sequence might represent an attempt to construct 'better and better' approximations to a desired measure μ that is difficult to obtain directly. The meaning of 'better and better' is subject to all the usual caveats for taking limits; for any error tolerance ε > 0 we require there be N sufficiently large for n ≥ N to ensure the 'difference' between μn and μ is smaller than ε. Various notions of convergence specify precisely what the word 'difference' should mean in that description; these notions are not equivalent to one another, and vary in strength.  Three of the most common notions of convergence are described below.  Informal descriptions This section attempts to provide a rough intuitive description of three notions of convergence, using terminology developed in calculus courses; this section is necessarily imprecise as well as inexact, and the reader should refer to the formal clarifications in subsequent sections. In particular, the descriptions here do not address the possibility that the measure of some sets could be infinite, or that the underlying space could exhibit pathological behavior, and additional technical assumptions are needed for some of the statements. The statements in this section are however all correct if  is a sequence of probability measures on a Polish space.  The various notions of convergence formalize the assertion that the 'average value' of each 'sufficiently nice' function should converge:  To formalize this requires a careful specification of the set of functions under consideration and how uniform the convergence should be.  The notion of weak convergence requires this convergence to take place for every continuous bounded function .  This notion treats convergence for different functions f independently of one another, i.e., different functions f may require different values of N ≤ n to be approximated equally well (thus, convergence is non-uniform in ).  The notion of setwise convergence formalizes the assertion that the measure of each measurable set should converge:  Again, no uniformity over the set  is required. Intuitively, considering integrals of 'nice' functions, this notion provides more uniformity than weak convergence. As a matter of fact, when considering sequences of measures with uniformly bounded variation on a Polish space, setwise convergence implies the convergence   for any bounded measurable function . As before, this convergence is non-uniform in   The notion of total variation convergence formalizes the assertion that the measure of all measurable sets should converge uniformly, i.e. for every  there exists N such that  for every n > N and for every measurable set . As before, this implies convergence of integrals against bounded measurable functions, but this time convergence is uniform over all functions bounded by any fixed constant.  Total variation convergence of measures This is the strongest notion of convergence shown on this page and is defined as follows. Let  be a measurable space. The total variation distance between two (positive) measures μ and ν is then given by  Here the supremum is taken over f ranging over the set of all measurable functions from X to [−1, 1]. This is in contrast, for example, to the Wasserstein metric, where the definition is of the same form, but the supremum is taken over f ranging over the set of measurable functions from X to [−1, 1] which have Lipschitz constant at most 1; and also in contrast to the Radon metric, where the supremum is taken over f ranging over the set of continuous functions from X to [−1, 1]. In the case where X is a Polish space, the total variation metric coincides with the Radon metric.  If μ and ν are both probability measures, then the total variation distance is also given by  The equivalence between these two definitions can be seen as a particular case of the Monge-Kantorovich duality.  From the two definitions above, it is clear that the total variation distance between probability measures is always between 0 and 2.  To illustrate the meaning of the total variation distance, consider the following thought experiment. Assume that we are given two probability measures μ and ν, as well as a random variable X. We know that X has law either μ or ν but we do not know which one of the two. Assume that these two measures have prior probabilities 0.5 each of being the true law of X. Assume now that we are given one single sample distributed according to the law of X and that we are then asked to guess which one of the two distributions describes that law. The quantity  then provides a sharp upper bound on the prior probability that our guess will be correct.  Given the above definition of total variation distance, a sequence μn of measures defined on the same measure space is said to converge to a measure μ in total variation distance if for every ε > 0, there exists an N such that for all n > N, one has that  Setwise convergence of measures For  a measurable space, a sequence μn is said to converge setwise to a limit μ if  for every set .  For example, as a consequence of the Riemann–Lebesgue lemma, the sequence μn of measures on the interval [−1, 1] given by μn(dx) = (1+ sin(nx))dx converges setwise to Lebesgue measure, but it does not converge in total variation.  Weak convergence of measures  In mathematics and statistics, weak convergence is one of many types of convergence relating to the convergence of measures. It depends on a topology on the underlying space and thus is not a purely measure theoretic notion.  There are several equivalent definitions of weak convergence of a sequence of measures, some of which are (apparently) more general than others. The equivalence of these conditions is sometimes known as the Portmanteau theorem.  Definition. Let  be a metric space with its Borel -algebra . A bounded sequence of positive probability measures  on  is said to converge weakly to the finite positive measure  (denoted ) if any of the following equivalent conditions is true (here  denotes expectation or the  norm with respect to , while  denotes expectation or the  norm with respect to ):    for all bounded, continuous functions ;   for all bounded and Lipschitz functions ;   for every upper semi-continuous function  bounded from above;   for every lower semi-continuous function  bounded from below;   for all closed sets  of space ;   for all open sets  of space ;   for all continuity sets  of measure .  In the case  with its usual topology, if  and  denote the cumulative distribution functions of the measures  and , respectively, then  converges weakly to  if and only if  for all points  at which  is continuous.  For example, the sequence where  is the Dirac measure located at  converges weakly to the Dirac measure located at 0 (if we view these as measures on  with the usual topology), but it does not converge setwise. This is intuitively clear: we only know that  is ""close"" to  because of the topology of .  This definition of weak convergence can be extended for  any metrizable topological space. It also defines a weak topology on , the set of all probability measures defined on .  The weak topology is generated by the following basis of open sets:  where  If  is also separable, then  is metrizable and separable, for example by the Lévy–Prokhorov metric. If  is also compact or Polish, so is .  If  is separable, it naturally embeds into  as the (closed) set of Dirac measures, and its convex hull is dense.  There are many ""arrow notations"" for this kind of convergence: the most frequently used are ,  and .  Weak convergence of random variables  Let  be a probability space and X be a metric space. If  is a sequence of random variables then Xn is said to converge weakly (or in distribution or in law) to X as  if the sequence of pushforward measures (Xn)∗(P) converges weakly to X∗(P) in the sense of weak convergence of measures on X, as defined above.

The concept was introduced by Émile Borel in 1909 and developed further by Fréchet (1912), who showed how to define it using sequences of simple functions.  The idea behind this approach is that if we have two different ways of measuring some quantity then their values should agree when averaged over large enough samples; thus any sequence of measurements made according to either measure will eventually become close together as more data are collected.   This type of convergence has been used extensively since its introduction into statistics where it plays a key role in hypothesis testing such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test which compares empirical distribution functions from sample sets taken from populations whose underlying cumulative distribution functions may differ significantly but still produce similar results under repeated sampling experiments.",wikipedia,bigscience/bloomz,Convergence of measures,0.10828025477707007,0.2,0.1183701538726038,0.31136363636363634,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0.03046313667213597,0.04468424105839955,0.038508309687880014,0.03502626970227671,4,0,14,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
Cerenzia,"Cerenzia is a town, comune (municipality), former bishopric and Latin titular see with a population of 1000 people in the province of Crotone, in Calabria region, southernmost peninsular Italy.  The modern town is besides the Ancient settlement Acerenthia, now a rural site known as Cerenzia vecchia ('old C.'), which includes the ruins of the cathedral dedicated to Saint Theodorus of Amasea, all abandoned to peasantry by the second half of the Ottocento (19th century).  Ecclesiastical history  Circa 960 was founded a Diocese of Cerenz(i)a (Italian) / Pumentum (Latin) / Cerenza /  (Latin adjective), bordering its invariable Metropolitan, the Archdiocese of Santa Severina, as well as the bishoprics of Umbriatico, Rossano and Cosenza. Its tiny territory comprised Cerenzia itself, the (now defunct) hamlets of Verzino and Lucrò and the castrum of Caccuri.  It is first documented in the Notitia Episcopatuum of the Patriarchate of Constantinople, edited under Byzantine emperor Leo VI the Wise (died 912).  Until the Norman conquest of Calabria (mid 11th century), it was in the sway of the above patriarchate and used its Greek-language Byzantine rite. A papal bulla by Pope Lucius III in 1183 explicitly mentions its being a suffragan of Santa Severina.  Noted early (late 11th century) bishop Policronius, recuperated the 'Greek' abbey of Santa Maria di Altilia. The bishoprics rich gifts and possessions aroused greed among the local barons, especially Marchisorto, count of Crotone Stefano, tried to impose in 1205 his chaplain, Madio, instead of legitimate bishop Guglielmo, elected by the (cathedral) chapter.  The arrival of the Angevine rule spelled the diocese's decline, among more conflict with the feudal lords, requiring appeals to Metropolitan and Pope.  Mid Trecento (14th century), the area suffered health problems like malaria and from its poor position, even for drinking water, leading to the city being abandoned and the countryside depopulated by harsh feudal impositions.  In 1342 the phrase 'Bishop of Cerenzia and Cariati' was coined, after the new effective seat, and in 1437[4], Pope Eugenius IV formally erected a Diocese of Cariati, immediately placing it in personal union (aeque principaliter) with the old see of Cerenzia. Given the decay of Cerenzia and its episcopal palace, when the Council of Trento imposed on all bishops a fixed residence, Cariati at sea, despite its exposure to Ottoman Turkish raids, was chosen over sickly isolated Cerenzia.  A pest epidemic in 1528 caused the town of Cerenzia and its five parishes to be abandoned, losing its diocesan archive. È in questa occasione che andò in gran parte perduto anche l'archivio. Visiting in the late Cinquecento, bishop Properzio Resta described its pitiful state, including cathedral and palace (Pesavento). Bishops' attempts in the Seicento and Settecento to restore the cathedral and build a new palace were undone by repeated, demotivating earthquakes.   As part of a reorganization of the dioceses of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, Pope Pius VII in 1818 incorporated the already united territory of the diocese of Cerenza into that of the diocese of Cariati, later merged itself into the present Archdiocese of Rossano-Cariati Vincenzio d'Avino,  As is customary, the bull referred to the see in adjectival form, and called it , suggesting as the Latin substantive (noun) form: .

They are first mentioned as early as 1260 when they appear to have been granted land by King Manfred I of Sicily at Monza; however their origins may be traced back even further than this date.  The name is derived from the Latin word arrigheo meaning ""to dig up or unearth""; it was originally given to one who dug out graves during funerals.   In 1330, Giovanni di Arrigo became podestà (mayor) of Milan under Emperor Louis IV.    They also held important positions within the Church including Cardinal Carlo di Arrigo, Bishop of Como between 1420-1440.     By 1570 there had already been four generations of cardinals among them.

Iain O'Brien,"Iain Edward O'Brien (born 10 July 1976) is a former New Zealand cricketer, who played 22 Tests, 10 ODIs and 4 T20Is. A pace bowler, he took 73 test wickets with best figures of 6 for 75 against West Indies in 2008. He played first class cricket for Wellington, the Leicestershire County Cricket Club and the Middlesex County Cricket Club.  He retired from all cricket in January 2012 due to chronic injury problems.  International career O'Brien made his debut for the national side in March 2005 following injuries to senior international players, such as Shane Bond, Daryl Tuffey and Chris Martin but has been in and out of the side since to replace injured and retired players. He made his One Day International debut against the England cricket team, and had a tough debut, with figures of 1/59 in 6 overs.  However, between 2007 and 2009 he established himself in the Test side, and to a lesser extent, in the ODI side, particularly in the absence of Shane Bond. He was renowned as an 'into-the-wind' bowler who would often bowl at an end that did not offer favourable bowling conditions, especially at the Basin Reserve in Wellington, a ground renowned for strong winds. He enjoyed much success as a fast bowler for the Black Caps, with great performances against England in the UK, and against the West Indies cricket team at home, where he took his best Test figures of 6/75, in a spell of bowling regarded as one of the best in New Zealand. These performance have given him the reputation as a wicket-taking bowler, and being the go-to man for Daniel Vettori, the captain. He continued his consistent spells against the Australia cricket team, home and away, and for Wellington.  During New Zealand's tour of England in 2008, he had had similar success, taking 15 wickets at 26.80. Against the Pakistan cricket team at home in December 2009, he has become well known for bowling New Zealand to victory by taking 3 wickets while suffering from a broken thumb. In this same series, he took 6 wickets in the next game, including 4/66, dismissing the likes of Salman Butt, Imran Farhat and Misbah-ul-Haq.  In December 2009, he announced his decision to retire from international cricket to spend more time with his wife in England and this decision prompted Middlesex to sign O'Brien as their overseas player for the 2010 season.  Domestic career He played at Leicestershire during the 2009 season as their overseas player, impressing by taking 21 first-class wickets at an average of 26.04 in a struggling team, including 9 wickets in a game where he took 6/39 on his birthday.  The 2010 season was a frustrating one for O'Brien, he took 23 wickets at an average of 27.30 for Middlesex in division two of the County championship. However, injury restricted his appearances for Middlesex to just seven championship matches, one CB40 match (in which he took 4–41 in 8 overs) & a single FP Twenty20 match.  Writing  Part of O'Brien's appeal to fans is because of his writing, both for his own blog and for cricinfo. Rarely has an international cricketer been so candid about his own faults during his career. O'Brien's blog is not updated straight away after all games, but he generally talks about all games he has played in. It is a far cry from the ghost written columns of most cricketers, and has got him in hot water with NZC before. O'Brien really enjoys writing and has already been a special guest writer in the book Ashes 09: When Freddie Became Jesus and is contributing to a book on New Zealand Indoor Cricket as well.  O'Brien also is an occasional contributor to Test Match Sofa – an online alternative cricket commentary service as well as BBC and Sky cricket commentary teams.

New London Harbor Light,"New London Harbor Light is a lighthouse in Connecticut on the west side of the New London harbor entrance. It is the nation's fifth oldest light station and the seventh oldest U.S. lighthouse. It is both the oldest and the tallest lighthouse in Connecticut and on Long Island Sound, with its tower reaching 90 feet.  The light is visible for 15 miles and consists of three seconds of white light every six seconds. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. It is currently owned and maintained by the New London Maritime Society as part of the National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act program.  Location New London Harbor Light is located at Lighthouse Point in southern New London, just east of Guthrie Beach off Pequot Avenue.  In addition to the lighthouse, the station includes the keeper's house, a two-and-a-half-story brick residence.  The property once also included a barn, an oil house, and an engine room; all of these structures have been removed.  History  The original New London Harbor Lighthouse was built on the west side of the entrance to New London Harbor in 1760. Connecticut ceded the lighthouse to the United States according to the ""Memoranda of Cessions"" of 7 August 1789.  On May 7, 1800, Congress appropriated funds to rebuild the lighthouse, and it was removed in 1801 when the current stone tower was built. In 1855, a fourth-order Fresnel lens replaced the original 11 lamps with  reflectors.  Illumination was converted to oil-vapor lamp in 1909 and to acetylene in 1912.  The light was electrified in 1930.  The present keeper's house was built in 1863, and was enlarged in 1900 to accommodate the families of married keepers.  The light was acquired by the New London Maritime Society in 2010.

Shchuchyn,"Ščučyn (, ; , ; ; ; Yiddish: שטשוטשין, Shtshutshin) is a city in the Grodno Region of Belarus.  It is the center of Shchuchyn District. The population is nearly 15,000 (2010).  History  The first known official written mention of Shchuchyn is recorded in 1436, but its foundation as a settlement dates back to 1537, when 'Shchuchyn was mentioned in the Book of Acts of the Lithuanian Metrica (the Book of Lithuanian vital records), kept in the Governmental archive in Lithuania.  Ownership of Shchuchyn passed from one noble family to another: The Radziwiłł family, then the Drutskiya-Liubetskis, the Scipions, and others ruled Shchuchyn in turn. In the 15th–18th centuries, Shchuchyn became a member of the Lida council of the Vilnius office of voivode. In the first half of the 17th century, Shchuchyn was governed by the outsider marshal of the Lithuanian principality, Scipio de Campo. Shchuchyn was an average-sized privately owned village in terms of population.  A Catholic Monasterial Order was established 1726 in Shchuchyn by the resolution of the Sejm. The Board of Shchuchyn was considered to be one of the biggest in Belarus.  Shchuchyn was subject to ruin and ravage more than once in its history. The biggest was in the time of the North War, after the town was seized by the Swedish king Karl XII. After the third partition of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1795, Shchuchyn became a part of the Russian Empire. In June 1812 Shchuchyn was occupied by French troops. And again in 1915, by the German Kaiser. In 1919 the Red Army attempted to seize Belarusian land by taking and fortifying the Martinkantsy - Shchuchyn - Shchara - lake Vygonovskoe line. However, the superior defence forces of the ""Land of Grodnenskaya"", together with Poland, forced the Red Army back. In 1939, Western Belarus, together with Shchuchyn, went under the control of the Soviet authorities. In World War II, Shchuchyn was occupied by German troops.  During the Nazi occupation from 25 June 1941 until 13 July 1944 the Nazi forces killed about 2180 Jews from the Shchuchyn ghetto with the majority of them killed on 10(9) May 1942.   In 1962, Shchuchyn was granted town status.  Air base  Until the collapse of the Soviet Union Shchuchyn was a home of one of the biggest Soviet air bases with over 5,000 personnel assigned to it in the 1990s. The history of the Soviet air force presence in the city goes back into 1941 with a wing of Polikarpov I-16. The air base hosted different types of the Soviet planes throughout the years, such as IL-28, MiG-15, MiG-19, An-14, MiG-21, MiG-23, MiG-25, and others. Most famously in the early 1990s it was a home of about 40 MiG-25BM defense-suppression aircraft, which represents the vast majority of this modification of MiG-25 ever produced. The base was controlled by the 95th air wing. The base's runway is 2,500 meters long.  Industry  Important industry: JSC “Shchuchyn plant “Avtoprovod” (found in 1958), JSC ""Shchuchyn butter-cheese factory"" and a bread factory.  Education  Primary and secondary education: three primary schools (each school combines grades one through twelve), a vocational technical school (VTS), a gymnasium. Also there are six government run daycare centres.  Demographics  Population of Shchuchyn:  1833 — 327; 1866 — 1088; 1897 — 1742; 1921 — 1539; 1940 — about 3500;  1959 — about 6500;  1970 — 10.3 thousands;  1991 — 14.4 thousands; 2002 — 16.3 thousands; 2006 — 15.8 thousands; 2009 — 15'042.

Elizabeth Fretwell,"Betty Drina Fretwell  (13 August 1920 – 5 June 2006), known professionally as Elizabeth Fretwell, was an Australian soprano.  She was the prima donna at London's Sadler's Wells Opera (English National Opera) through much of the 1950s and 1960s.  Early life and career  She was born in Murrumbeena, a suburb of Melbourne. As a child, she had hoped to become a ballerina. However, she grew too big for this profession. She focussed instead on singing, taking vocal studies in Melbourne. Her operatic career began in 1950. In 1954, she sang Antonia in Offenbach's The Tales of Hoffmann before Queen Elizabeth II who was on her first tour of Australia. In order to gain greater skill, she moved to London to study under the tenor Joseph Hislop who had also coached Jussi Björling and Birgit Nilsson.  After returning to Australia she quickly started to make a name for herself, taking soprano roles in operas by Mozart and Puccini, amongst others. It was while on an Australian national tour of Tosca that she had an extramarital affair with the Australian baritone Robert Simmons (they were later to marry), with whom she later had a son, John Simmons, now a Melbourne architect, and a daughter Geraldine 'Geri' Roggiero née Simmons now a Sydney wildlife artist.  This caused a scandal in 1950s Australia so she and Simmons headed for the United Kingdom.  Sadler's Wells Once in Britain, Fretwell's first professional engagement was for Dublin's Grand Opera company.  Her performances there came to the attention of Sadler's Wells and in 1955 they engaged her services as principal soprano. It was at this point she became known as Elizabeth Fretwell. Sadler's was where Fretwell's finest performances were given, and she gained rave reviews. This was no small achievement given that at that time Maria Callas was dominant on the London opera stage. From the early 1960s to 1970 she went back and forth between Australia and the UK performing. In 1965 she gave her only performances at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in Aida and Il tabarro. She also performed with Scottish and Canadian companies and in North America.  Later career and death In 1969 Fretwell sang opposite Tito Gobbi in Falstaff, finally joining the ensemble of The Australian Opera in 1970.  During 1973 she sang in the opening season of the Sydney Opera House. She remained a member of the Australian Opera (now Opera Australia) until her retirement. In her later career, she took on smaller roles, to give up-and-coming singers there a chance to further their careers as principal singers.  Her retirement was very low key; no one in the company knew of her impending retirement before she left. She did not want any fanfare or accolades at her last performance, and therefore only the management of the Australian Opera knew of her decision to retire in the late 1980s. She simply gave her last performance, then quietly went to her dressing room, packed up her makeup and personal belongings, and went home to her beloved house at Bayview, on the northern beaches of Sydney, and reverted to her married name of Betty Simmons.   She later served on the Opera Foundation's board for a number of years.   She was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1977.  On 5 June 2006, she died suddenly at her Bayview home, from a ruptured cerebral artery aneurysm, aged 85.   She was survived by her son and daughter, and four grandchildren.

Naval Intelligence Department (United Kingdom),"The Naval Intelligence Department (NID) was the intelligence arm of the British Admiralty from 1887 until 1912 when most of its subsidiary divisions were absorbed during the creation of the Admiralty War Staff department that included a new Naval Intelligence Division that concentrated in that sphere solely. It dealt with intelligence matters concerning British naval plans, and with the collection of naval intelligence in regard to coastal defences, foreign powers, mobilisation, trade and war.  History The Foreign Intelligence Committee was established in 1882 and it evolved into the Naval Intelligence Department in 1887.  The NID staff were originally responsible for fleet mobilisation and war plans as well as foreign intelligence collection; thus in the beginning there were originally two divisions: (1) intelligence (Foreign) and (2) Mobilisation. In 1900 another division, War, was added to deal with issues of strategy and defence, and in 1902 a fourth division, Trade, was created for matters related to the protection of merchant shipping. The Trade Division was abolished in October 1909 in the wake of the Committee of Imperial Defence inquiry into the feud between the First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir John Fisher and former Commander-in-Chief Channel Fleet, Admiral Lord Charles Beresford, when it was discovered that the captain heading the Trade Division had been supplying the latter with confidential information during the inquiry.  In 1910, the NID was shorn of its responsibility for war planning and strategy when the outgoing Fisher created the Navy War Council as a stop-gap remedy to criticisms emanating from the Beresford Inquiry that the Navy needed a naval staff—a role the NID had been in fact fulfilling since at least 1900, if not earlier. After this reorganisation, war planning and strategic matters were transferred to the newly created Naval Mobilisation Department and the NID reverted to the position it held prior to 1887—an intelligence collection and collation organisation.  In 1912 the department was restructured with most of its divisions and functions being absorbed within the Admiralty War Staff organisation the department was abolished and re-emerged as the Naval Intelligence Division of the new department.

Yokohama National University,", or  is a national university located in Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. Founded in 1876, it became a national university in 1949, and currently comprises five graduate schools and four undergraduate faculties.  The university has been evaluated highly from the business world and was ranked 1st in Kantō (including Greater Tokyo Area) and Kōshin'etsu region and 2nd in Japan by personnel departments of leading companies in Japan in 2020. The university was also ranked 10th in Japan according to the ratio of the number of officers and managers produced to the number of graduates.  History  The predecessor of the university, Yokohama Normal School, was founded in 1876. It became a Japanese national university in 1949 by the amalgamation of Kanagawa Normal School, Kanagawa Youth Normal School, Yokohama College of Economics and the Yokohama Institute of Technology.  The university was originally planned to be named as ""Yokohama University"", but at the time the former Yokohama City Economics College and Yokohama Vocational School also wanted to apply their names as Yokohama University. They had a consultation about the name and decided not to use name ""Yokohama University"".  The Faculty of Business Administration was founded in 1967. The university has master's degree programs in engineering (1962), economics (1972), business administration (1972), and education (1979). The Institute of Environmental Science and Technology was established in 1973 under the botanist Akira Miyawaki, and the Graduate School of International and Business Law was established in 1990. The Graduate School of International Development Studies was created in 1994 and the School of Law in 2004.

The college (undergraduate) prides itself in contributing to the advancement of economic theory and empirics. Every year many aspiring students apply for entrance, and after an intensive four-year period of training in economic thought and research, they successfully graduate as competent experts in their fields. Recognized internationally as a center of economic study, an array of nationalities are represented in the college as lecturers, researchers and students. The College of Economics promotes cultural diversity and host many international students both on scholarships and self-funded. At the Master's level, the Faculty of Economics is host to the Joint Japan World Bank Graduate Scholarship Program. In the fall of 2013, YNU Economics began offering M.A. and Ph.D. degrees where the course content, advising, etc. is offered entirely in the English language.  Faculty of Business Administration Yokohama National University's Faculty of Business Administration was established in 1967, and currently composed of four disciplinary areas: the Division of Business Administration, the Division of Accounting and Information, the Division of Management System Science and the Division of International Business. The faculty places emphasis on internationalization, with not only Japanese students, but also many students from overseas currently enrolled. Students are free to register subjects outside of their own division, and so are able to gain an education that covers all aspects of business administration. In the latter half of second year, students are assigned to a seminar, where they do research in a specialized area of an advising professor.  College of Urban Sciences Urban Sciences is an academic field that focuses on an important theme—how cities should be in the future—from a scientific point of view. The College of Urban Sciences was newly established in April 2017, and comprises of the following four departments: (1) the Department of Urban and Social Collaboration for studying cultural and social sciences, with the objective of create a pleasant urban society and culture; (2) the Department of Architecture and Building Science for studying creative architecture, urban environments, and town development; (3) the Department of Civil Engineering for studying technology and management relating to the infrastructure supporting urban activities; and (4) the Department of Risk Management and Environmental Science for studying sustainable urban development with the understanding of natural and social environmental risks. The College pursues the development of talented people who can commit themselves to creating cities from broad perspectives that include liberal arts and scientific viewpoint.

The university was established on March 1, 1877 under Imperial Japanese Government Ordinance No. 1261 to provide higher education opportunities within its borders after it had annexed Taiwan from Qing dynasty rule three years earlier.  It was originally called ""National College of Formosa"" or ""Kōtoku Gakkō"" (公徳学校), but changed its name to ""National Institute of Technology"" when Emperor Meiji granted permission to use his personal seal.   In 1918, the institute became affiliated with Tokyo Imperial University through the Imperial Rescript of Enlightenment.    After World War II ended,  the school resumed operation at its original location in Taipei City, Taiwan until 1949, then moved back to Japan where it continued operating out of temporary facilities before moving into permanent buildings constructed during the 1960s.   Since 1977, the university's main campus has expanded greatly;  currently occupying over 300 hectares along the southern shore of Motomachi Bay near downtown Yokohama.     As part of efforts to promote internationalization among students, faculty members are encouraged to study abroad and/or teach courses taught entirely in English language.

Gateway station (PAAC),"Gateway is a station on the Port Authority of Allegheny County's Pittsburgh Light Rail network, located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Until October 30, 2009, it was the network's westernmost extent within downtown Pittsburgh. The Port Authority closed Gateway Center as part of construction work on the North Shore Connector project, and a new station opened in 2012 (though its name was truncated from ""Gateway Center"" to simply ""Gateway""). The former station entrance was demolished and a new station was built. Gateway station and North Side station lie at the southern and northern ends of the Allegheny River Tunnel, respectively.  History Gateway Center station was opened on 3 July 1985 as part of the new subway system that replaced the remaining downtown street running trolleys. Named for Gateway Center, the adjacent office complex, the station served the western portion of downtown. The stop also served major buildings such as One PPG Place and Fifth Avenue Place, the shopping and dining district at Market Square, and the historical and recreational hub of Point State Park.  Gateway Center closed on October 30, 2009 as part of the North Shore Connector project, and a newly constructed station (named Gateway) opened just north of the original station on March 25, 2012. The original outbound platform under Liberty Ave was left intact, but the inbound platform was demolished to make the curve onto Stanwix Street.  The station features a mural by artist Romare Bearden. Commissioned by the Port Authority as part of the original station complex, the mural is now valued at $15 million. The Heinz Endowments has pledged $250,000 toward the costs of removal and refurbishment.  The mural was removed when the station was demolished, but was reinstalled in the new station. The original mural had one tile which had accidentally been placed upside-down, and the reinstallation of the mural faithfully reproduced this error.

International Knockout Mouse Consortium,"The International Knockout Mouse Consortium (IKMC) is a scientific endeavour to produce a collection of mouse embryonic stem cell lines that together lack every gene in the genome, and then to distribute the cells to scientific researchers to create knockout mice to study. Many of the targeted alleles are designed so that they can generate both complete and conditional gene knockout mice. The IKMC was initiated on March 15, 2007 at a meeting in Brussels. By 2011, Nature reported that approximately 17,000 different genes have already been disabled by the consortium, ""leaving only around 3,000 more to go"".  The consortium encompasses four major, high-throughput gene-targeted mutagenesis programs: the National Institutes of Health (NIH)-sponsored Knockout Mouse Program (KOMP) and state-funded Texas Institute for Genomic Medicine (TIGM) in the U.S., the North American Conditional Mouse Mutagenesis (NorCOMM) Program in Canada, and the European Conditional Mouse Mutagenesis (EUCOMM) Programme in Europe.

Cruciate ligament,"Cruciate ligaments (also cruciform ligaments) are pairs of ligaments arranged like a letter X.  They occur in several joints of the body, such as the knee joint and the atlanto-axial joint.  In a fashion similar to the cords in a toy Jacob's ladder, the crossed ligaments stabilize the joint while allowing a very large range of motion.  Knee  Structure  Cruciate ligaments occur in the knee of humans and other bipedal animals and the corresponding stifle of quadrupedal animals, and in the neck, fingers, and foot.   The cruciate ligaments of the knee are the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL).  These ligaments are two strong, rounded bands that extend from the head of the tibia to the intercondyloid notch of the femur. The ACL is lateral and the PCL is medial.  They cross each other like the limbs of an X.  They are named for their insertion into the tibia: the ACL attaches to the anterior aspect of the intercondylar area, the PCL to the posterior aspect. The ACL and PCL remain distinct throughout and each has its own partial synovial sheath.  Relative to the femur, the ACL keeps the tibia from slipping forward and the PCL keeps the tibia from slipping backward.  Another structure of this type in human anatomy is the cruciate ligament of the dens of the atlas vertebra, also called ""cruciform ligament of the atlas"", a ligament in the neck forming part of the atlanto-axial joint.  In the fingers, the deep and superficial flexor tendons pass through a fibro-osseous tunnel system – the flexor mechanism – of annular and cruciate ligaments called pulleys. The cruciate pulleys tether the long flexor tendons.  The number and extent of these cruciate and annular ligaments varies among individuals, but three cruciate and four or five annular ligaments are normally found in each finger (usually referred to as, for example, ""A1 pulley"" and ""C1 pulley"").  The thumb has a similar system for its long flexor tendon but with a single oblique pulley replacing the cruciate pulleys found in the fingers.  The human foot has a cruciate crural ligament, also known as inferior extensor retinaculum of foot. The equine foot has a pair of cruciate distal sesamoidean ligaments in the metacarpophalangeal joint.  These ligaments can be seen using computed tomography.  Clinical significance  Rupture  Rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament is one of the ""most frequent acquired diseases of the stifle joint"" in humans, dogs, and cats; direct trauma to the joint is relatively uncommon and age appears to be a major factor.  Cruciate ligament injuries are common in animals, and in 2005 a study estimated that $1.32 billion was spent in the United States in treating the cranial cruciate ligament of dogs.  Rupture in canines and surgical repair techniques   In animals the two cruciate ligaments that cross the inside of the knee joint are referred to as the cranial cruciate (equivalent to anterior in humans) and the caudal cruciate (equivalent to the posterior in humans). The cranial cruciate ligament prevents the tibia from slipping forward out from under the femur. Stifle injuries are one of the most common causes of lameness in rear limbs in dogs, and cruciate ligament injuries are the most common lesion in the stifle joint. A rupture of the cruciate ligament usually involves a rear leg to suddenly become so sore that the dog can barely bear weight on it. How a rupture can occur: There are several ways a dog can tear or rupture the cruciate ligament. Young athletic dogs can be seen with this rupture if they take a bad step while playing too rough and injure their knee. Older dogs, especially if overweight, can have weakened ligaments that can be stretched or torn by simply stepping down off the bed or jumping. Large overweight dogs are at more risk for ruptures of the cruciate ligament. In these instances it is common to see a rupture in the other leg within a year's time of the first rupture. Common breeds that are seen with cruciate ligament ruptures: In recent survey's some of the large breed dogs that seem to be at risk for obtaining  these ruptures were: Neapolitan mastiff, Newfoundland, St. Bernard, Rottweiler, Chesapeake Bay retriever, Akita, and American Staffordshire terrier. However, other breeds have been observed with these ruptures, such as: Labradors, Labrador crossbreeds, Poodles, Poodle crossbreeds, Bichon Frises, German Shepherds, Shepherd crossbreeds, and Golden Retrievers. Diagnosis:  History, palpation, observation and proper radiography is important in properly assessing the patient. The key in diagnosing a rupture of the cruciate ligament is the demonstration of an abnormal gait in the dog. Abnormal knee motion is typically observed and diagnosis of a rupture can be made by performing the drawer sign test. The drawer sign: The examiner stands behind the dog and places a thumb on the caudal aspect of the femoral condylar region with the index finger on the patella. The other thumb is placed on the head of the fibula with the index finger on the tibial crest. The ability to move the tibia forward (cranially) with respect to a fixed femur is a positive cranial drawer sign indicative of a rupture (it will look like a drawer being opened).  Another method used to diagnose a rupture is the tibial compression test, in which a veterinarian will stabilize the femur with one hand and flex the ankle with the other hand. The tibia will move abnormally forward if a rupture is present. For proper diagnosis sedation is typically needed since most animals tend to be tense or frightened at the vet's office. If the animal tenses its muscles, temporary stabilization of the knee can be observed which would prevent demonstration of the drawer sign or tibial compression test. Radiographs are typically necessary to identify whether bone chips, from where the ligament attaches to the tibia, are present. This can occur when the cruciate ligament tears, and if found will require surgical repair. Surgical repair Three surgical techniques are commonly used Extracapsular repair Any bone spurs are removed and a large suture is passed around the fabella behind the knee through a drilled hole in the front of the tibia. This surgical procedure tightens the joint to prevent the drawer motion, and the suture that is put in place takes the job of the cruciate ligament for approximately 2 to 12 months after surgery. The suture will eventually break and the dog will have its own healed tissue that will hold the knee in place. Tibial plateau leveling osteotomy  This surgery uses biomechanics of the knee joint and is meant to address the lack of success seen in the extracapsular repair surgery in larger dogs. A stainless steel bone plate is used to hold the two pieces of bone in place. This surgery is complex and typically costs more than the extracapsular repair. Tibial tuberosity advancement  This surgery aims at advancing the tibial tuberosity forward in order to modify the pull of the quadriceps muscle group, which in turn helps reduce tibial thrust and ultimately stabilizes the knee. The tibial tuberosity is separated and anchored to its new position by a titanium or steel cage, “fork”, and plate. Bone graft is used to stimulate bone healing.

Etymology  In the first edition of the official Latin nomenclature (Nomina Anatomica, renamed in 1998 as Terminologia Anatomica), the Latin expression ligamenta cruciata was used, similar to the expression cruciate ligaments currently in use in English. In classical Latin the verb cruciare is derived from crux, meaning cross. It became considered that cruciate was equivalent to cross-shaped.

Post Traumatic Slave Syndrome,"Post Traumatic Slave Syndrome: America's Legacy of Enduring Injury and Healing is a 2005 theoretical work by Joy DeGruy Leary.  The book argues that the experience of slavery in the United States and the continued discrimination and oppression endured by African Americans creates intergenerational psychological trauma, leading to a psychological and behavioral syndrome common among present-day African Americans, manifesting as a lack of self-esteem, persistent feelings of anger, and internalized racist beliefs. The book was first published by Uptone Press in Milwaukie, Oregon in 2005, with a later re-release by the author in 2017.  Post Traumatic Slave Syndrome Expanding on a hypothesis of ""post-traumatic slavery syndrome"" by psychiatrist Alvin Francis Poussaint and journalist Amy L. Alexander, DeGruy wrote in her 2001 doctoral thesis that African Americans ""sustained traumatic injury as a direct result of slavery and continue to be injured by traumas caused by the larger society's policies of inequality, racism, and oppression."" This is summed up in Post Traumatic Slave Syndrome as:  In the book, DeGruy argues that PTSS is a result of unresolved post-traumatic stress disorder arising from the experience of slavery, transmitted across generations down to the present day, along with the stress of contemporary racial prejudice (e.g. via racial microaggressions). This manifests as a psychological, spiritual, emotional, and behavioral syndrome that results in a lack of self-esteem, persistent feelings of anger, and internalized racist beliefs.  DeGruy states that PTSS is not a disorder that can simply be treated and remedied clinically but rather requires profound social change in individuals, as well as in institutions, that continue to reify inequality and injustice toward the descendants of enslaved Africans.  The theory has been generative of subsequent academic work in clinical psychology and black studies.  Reception In addition to forming the basis of public lectures and workshops offered by DeGruy and her contemporaries, the research described in Post Traumatic Slave Syndrome inspired an eponymous play, which was staged at the Henry Street Settlement Experimental Theater, New York, in 2001.

Yiddishkayt (organization),"Yiddishkayt is a Yiddish cultural and educational organization, based in Los Angeles, California.  Its offices are located in the Pellissier Building above the Wiltern Theater in the Koreatown District of Los Angeles. Its name refers to the cultural concept of yiddishkayt, (Yiddish culture, literally ""Jewishness"" or ""Yiddishness""), which the American Jewish critic Irving Howe described not in religious terms, but rather as a humanism based in a ""readiness to live...beyond the clamor of self."" According to the Yiddishkayt website, the organization seeks to ""inspire current and future generations with the artists, writers, musicians, performers, filmmakers, philosophers, and social justice activists whose yiddishkayt — their particular form of critical and compassionate engagement with humanity — emerged from the Jewish communities of Europe as they developed in constant contact with their non-Jewish neighbors.""  Since its founding in 1995, Yiddishkayt has become the largest organization devoted to yiddishkayt west of the Hudson and has produced six Yiddish festivals, a high school Yiddish language education program, two local cultural fellowships, 30 Los Angeles premiere, 16 US premiere and 5 world premiere presentations devoted to Yiddish culture, 10 cross-cultural performances, and partnerships with over 25 organizations and venues, including the Workmen's Circle, REDCAT, University of California, Los Angeles, Hollywood Forever Cemetery, and the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books. In 2009 and 2010, Yiddishkayt was named by Slingshot Fund as the ""50 of the most innovative organizations in Jewish life today.""  History and activities In 1995 cultural festival organizer Aaron Paley — founder of Los Angeles nonprofits Community Arts Resources (CARS) and CicLAvia — produced a one-day festival of Yiddish culture that attracted close to 6,000 people, launching Yiddishkayt Los Angeles as an organization.  Until 2004, the organization's hallmark productions were the Yiddishkayt Festivals, comprising a one-day family festival with a week-long series of events spotlighting Yiddish culture in the mosaic of cultures that thrive in Los Angeles.  The first citywide Yiddishkayt Festival in 1998 featured 26 events in 19 venues, including many cross-cultural collaborations including a Klezmer-Mariachi commission and presentations at non-Jewish venues, such as the first reading of Yiddish at the Los Angeles Central Library. Yiddishkayt then expanded beyond the one-week festival model to a season of diverse, cultural programming including concerts, lectures, films and other events with artists, writers, filmmakers, musicians and academics pushing the boundaries of contemporary Yiddish culture. Examples of events produced by Yiddishkayt in the late 2000s include 2008’s ""The ¡Viva Yiddish! Project: The Yiddish-Latino Sound of Los Angeles"" at California Plaza — in partnership with Grand Performance and featuring members of LA's Ozomatli — and 2009’s Doikayt: A Los Angeles Community-Wide Artist/Yiddish Passover Seder in partnership with the Jewish Artists Initiative (JAI).  Yiddishkayt has also applied the principle of Doikayt through local history programming including tours of the neighborhood of Boyle Heights, Los Angeles, a historically multi-ethnic area that was once the hub of Los Angeles Yiddish cultural life. Stops on the tour have included the Breed Street Shul, the former Soto-Michigan Jewish Community Center, and Phillips Music Company, a store that served a diverse range of musicians including Mickey Katz, Los Lobos, and Thee Midniters.  Aside from producing performances, festivals, and tours, Yiddishkayt has also worked on Yiddish language and cultural educational projects for both youth and adults. In December 2000, Yiddishkayt organized ""The Art of Yiddish: Cultural Nourishment for a New Age,"" a ""two-week immersion in the living language."" Yiddish scholar Jeffrey Shandler has characterized Yiddishkayt's presentation of Yiddish culture and language as ""nature and nurture, art and science, as well as old and new, local and exotic, singular and enduring, inscrutable and accessible."" In 2005, with major funding from the Steven Spielberg-founded Righteous Persons Foundation, Yiddishkayt embarked on a three-year pilot program to reintroduce Yiddish language and culture as a possible systematic course of instruction in American Jewish day schools, including the de Toledo High School.  Since the early 2010s, under the directorship of Robert Adler Peckerar, Yiddishkayt's focus has shifted to occupy a more international, inter-cultural, and digital presence. The most significant venture has been the Wallis Annenberg Helix Fellowship. Originally launched as Helix Project, the program was an immersive summer travel education program for university and graduate students. Beginning in 2011, Yiddishkayt has taken groups of students on subsidized trips through the historic Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (modern-day Belarus, Poland, and Lithuania), a territory that was home to millions of Yiddish-speaking Litvaks and where Yiddish was recognized as an official language. The Helix Project is designed to immerse its participants in the multi-ethnic culture of Jewish Lithuania, and students visit notable sites in Eastern European Jewish cultural and political history, including the urban centers of Minsk, Grodno, Brest-Litovsk, Białystok, and Vilnius, as well as places relevant to the lives of Yiddish cultural figures such as the poets Moyshe Kulbak and Abraham Sutzkever, the actor and director Solomon Mikhoels, anarchist thinker and activist Emma Goldman, and the members of the General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia. Accompanying the Helix Fellows are scholars in the fields of Jewish language, literature, and history, as well as writers, musicians, and artists who incorporate Yiddish language and culture into their work. Early in 2019, Yiddishkayt announced a major gift from Wallis Annenberg to support the Helix project and develop it into a broader program, the Wallis Annenberg Helix Fellowship. The Fellowship now attracts artists and scholars from around the world for a year-long immersive program with a month-long residential component to explore Jewish history, culture, and art.  Activism and controversies In recent years, Yiddishkayt's leadership has been outspoken on Yiddish issues, especially the Los Angeles and broader American Jewish establishment's attitudes towards Yiddish culture.  While leading a tour of Jewish Boyle Heights in 2006, Yiddishkayt founder Aaron Paley discovered that the historic Soto-Michigan Jewish Community Center had been demolished without Boyle Heights community leaders or Jewish historical activists being notified. In the LA Times, Paley denounced the demolition and its consequences for Boyle Heights' historical memory, calling the community center ""a place where multicultural politics began.""  In May, 2013, Yiddishkayt Executive Director Rob Adler Peckerar published an open letter on the organization's website lamenting the ""state of Jewish philanthropy"" in the wake of his attempts to fundraise for the Helix Project. According to Adler Peckerar, his solicitations were met on multiple occasions with criticisms that the trip did not feature ""enough death,"" did not visit Israel, and was open to non-Jewish students. Additionally, a Jewish studies scholar was quoted in a Los Angeles Times article as saying that the Helix Project's focus on the role of secular yiddishkayt in historical Jewish identity was ""just stupid"" and an ""attempt to rewrite Jewish history.""  Also in 2013, the Los Angeles Times published a story documenting Adler Peckerar's discovery of the dilapidated Mount Zion Cemetery in East Los Angeles and the grave of the Yiddish writer Lamed Shapiro. Following the article's publication, Los Angeles philanthropist Shlomo Rechnitz donated $250,000 towards the cemetery's restoration, a project undertaken by a rabbi from Chabad of Downtown Los Angeles.  In a blog post on the Yiddishkayt website, Adler Peckerar criticized the restoration efforts on the part of Chabad and the Jewish Federation of Los Angeles, especially given the leftist politics and secularism of Lamed Shapiro and many other Los Angeles Jews interred at Mount Zion. ""Rather than to look at what a neglected cemetery might tell us about a community’s relationship to its past or reconsider the disregard shown to its once-distinguished cultural icons,"" Adler Peckerar wrote. ""The immediate reaction was to cover our collective shame and get renovations started.""

Route 40 (MTA Maryland),"Route 40 is a limited stop bus route, identified as a ""QuickBus"", operated by the Maryland Transit Administration in Baltimore and its suburbs. The line currently runs from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in Woodlawn to Middle River, both in Baltimore County, Maryland (on opposite sides) with selected trips terminating at Downtown Baltimore City Hall, passing through the west and east sides and the downtown area of Baltimore City. Service operates every 12 minutes during rush hour, and every 15 minutes at most other times during its hours of operation. The line serves the corridors of Edmondson Avenue in West Baltimore, including the communities of Edmondson Village, Allendale, and Rosemont, and Fayette Street and Eastern Avenue in East Baltimore, serving Patterson Park, Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center and Essex.  Unlike a local bus, the 40 does not stop at every bus stop along its route. Rather, its stops are limited to certain locations of importance, including transfer points to other bus lines, major landmarks, and other busy intersections selected by MTA. In all, there are 32 stops along the route in each direction, which are all identified in printed timetables.  History The Route 40 started operating on October 23, 2005 as part of the Greater Baltimore Bus Initiative, a plan of then-governor Robert L. Ehrlich for streamlining and simplifying the Baltimore transit system. Unlike a rail line, this addition did not require any construction. The bus route was intended to resemble the proposed Red Line that is currently being studied for the Baltimore region.  When it started operating, Route 40 ran from Security Square Mall to the Essex Park-and-Ride lot on Eastern Avenue. Weekday service operated every 10 minutes during rush hour and midday. On February 5 the following year, it was extended to Middle River and reduced to one bus every 12–15 minutes.  On June 10, 2007, the eastern layover was moved to a safer location at Old Eastern and Vincent Avenues. The western layover was moved to CMS on February 8, 2009 and the stop at Security Square Mall was moved from the parking lot of the mall to a point along Security Boulevard adjacent to the mall lot.  Quickbus 40 PLUS Service Enhanced service for West Baltimore residents on the QuickBus 40 will begin October 25th, 2015.  The enhanced service will increase frequency and reliability on the line between the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid in Baltimore County and City Hall in Baltimore City.  Customer will find additional bus trips added on west side between CMS and City Hall to enhance off-peak and weekend access to jobs.  Criticism  Route 40 received a lot of criticism following its inauguration from riders, politicians, and the media. This criticism resulted in some changes being made to the route, schedule, and other details.  The service, which was projected to have a daily ridership level of 27,000, fell far short of that goal. Many riders waiting for other buses at common stops complained about seeing a lot of empty Route 40 buses. This resulted in its weekday frequency being reduced.  Low ridership and unrealistic time allocation initially being built into the schedule resulted in poor on-time performance and buses clumping together. As one bus fell behind schedule while busy picking up passengers, the one behind it got ahead after stops had been cleared of waiting passengers, and ultimately caught up to the earlier bus. This left larger gaps between buses.  Financial resources needed in order to operate this service were obtained by cutting back on the amount of local bus service along common streets of operation, mostly on Route 23, which had its level of service cut by nearly 50% when Route 40 was introduced. This brought the number of local buses on these busy streets below the demand.  The service's original route had an eastern terminus at Essex Park-and-Ride lot, which was more than a mile short of the transfer point for some other lines, including Routes 24 and 55. An extension in February 2006 to Middle River allowed riders to transfer directly to those routes.  On the west side of the route, there is no designated Park-and-Ride lot allowing motorists to park their vehicles and catch the bus. Security Square Mall has not allocated any spaces for riders of Route 40, and an existing park-and-ride lot at the end of I-70 is not within a practical or pedestrian friendly walk of a bus stop.  While rapid transit lines are generally modeled for commuter purposes, QuickBus is marketed only to those who do not own vehicles and depend on a neighborhood bus stop.  Tracking of buses At 11 stops along the route, a new experimental system was installed late in 2006. Electronic signs at these stops, tied into a GPS system, indicate the expected time of arrival for the next bus, so riders do not have to rely on a less reliable printed schedule. MTA is considering implementing this system at many more bus stops along other routes in the future.  This system has been highly criticized. It is expensive, and money spent on it has not been spent on improving bus service around the Baltimore area. Even when fully in place, these signs will only be found at a small percentage of bus stops, and will not be useful to everyone.  QuickBus Structuring On December 21, 2006, Bus Route 40 was rebranded as ""QuickBus"" in order to better promote the service. Special pylons were added at selected stops to mark the locations.  The name ""QuickBus"" was synonymous with Bus Route 40 until August 30, 2009, when another QuickBus line, known as Route 48, started operation along the Greenmount Ave/York Rd corridor. The MTA had added two more QuickBus lines: Route 46 and Route 47 on August 29, 2010.

SS Minnesota (1903),"SS Minnesota was an American built ocean-liner operated by the Great Northern Steamship Company which was owned by James J. Hill. From 27 February 1919 until 15 September 1919 the ship was commissioned as USS Troy for U.S. naval service. She was an identical sister ship to the  which sank in Japan in 1907. Both ships built in 1903 were the largest and most luxurious liners built in the United States at the opening of the 20th century. The passenger telephone system, another was installed for ship's use, was advertised by the manufacturer, Electric Gas Lighting Company of Boston, to be the largest shipboard installation.  Minnesota was sold in January 1917 to the Atlantic Transport Company of West Virginia, part of J. P. Morgan's International Mercantile Marine Company, reaching New York in March where she was armed in accordance with measures authorized for merchant ships and received a U.S. Navy armed guard gun crew. The ship was in English waters when the United States declared war and made seven wartime round trips. During one of the New York port calls the ship was inspected and accepted for U.S. Navy use assigned the identification number 1614 until the end of hostilities whereupon the armament and naval personnel were removed.   The Navy chartered Minnesota to bring troops home, renamed the ship Troy and placed her in commission at the Army's Bush Terminal in Brooklyn, N.Y., on 27 February 1919 under the command of Lt. Comdr. Thomas W. Garlick, USNRF. Troy departed 9 May 1919 in the first of a series of voyages until decommissioned on 15 September 1919, returned to her owners and regaining the name Minnesota. The ship was converted for oil use but never operated again at sea. During the  flu pandemic the ship was operated as a floating isolation hospital in New York.  She was scrapped in 1923.

ALCO S-2 and S-4,"The ALCO S-2 and S-4 were  diesel electric switchers produced by ALCO and Canadian licensee Montreal Locomotive Works (MLW).  Powered by turbocharged, 6-cylinder ALCO 539 diesel engines, the two locomotives differed mainly in their trucks: the S-2 had ALCO ""Blunt"" trucks; the S-4, AAR type A switcher trucks. A total of 1,502 S-2s were built from August 1940 to June 1950; 797 S-4s were built from June 1949 to August 1957. The S-4 was first produced in Canada, with ALCO production beginning in June 1949.   The S-2 and S-4 were designed as rail yard switchers, meant to replace older, less efficient, and more demanding steam switchers. They were a success, with many remaining in service today.  The locomotives' exterior was styled by ALCO engineer Ray Patten, who used curves in a mild application of Art Deco principles.   The S-2 and S-4 are distinguishable externally from the very similar S-1 and S-3 660 hp (492 kW) switchers in that they have a larger exhaust stack with an oblong base and a larger radiator shutter area on the nose sides. The S-1/S-3 radiator shutter area is taller than it is wide, while the S-2/S-4 radiator area is wider. The larger stack is due to turbocharging. The carbody and cab of late S-2s are nearly indistinguishable from those of S-4s. Hence, a truck swap can cause many to misidentify a unit.  Survivors A few S-2s and S-4s are still in service on short line railroads around the United States.  Several more are preserved in U.S. and Canadian railroad museums.  Operable   Conrad Yelvington Distributors, an aggregate supplier in Orlando, Florida, owns and operates six S-2 locomotives and one S-4 locomotive. The S-2's include former C&O 5029, B&O 516 Ontario Northland 1202 and 1201, and Seaboard Air Lane 1428 and 1431. They are now Conrad Yelvington locomotives 224, 238, 239, 251, 317, and 366, respectively.  The S-4, formerly C&O 5105, is now Conrad Yelvington locomotive 365.  The Oil Creek and Titusville Railroad operates S-2s #75 and #85 on its tourist/freight railroad.  The Toledo, Lake Erie, and Western owns three ALCO S-2 locomotives and one ALCO S-4. TLEW 62, a S-2 purchased in 2012, ex. Delray Cement 62, TLEW 112, a S-2 that was part of the original TLEW roster, now reduced to a parts unit as of 2010, TLEW 5109, a S-4, and the only operating ALCO on the line currently. 5109 recently was repainted into its original Chesapeake and Ohio colors in September 2013.  An ALCO S-2 built in 1946 was serving the Columbia & Reading Railway as #2-26 in Columbia, Pennsylvania, during 2019 after first operating on the C&O as #5015 and later on six other railroads.  The North Alabama Railroad Museum in Huntsville, Alabama runs one S-2 in regular tourist excursions, Mercury & Chase #213. It also owns another S-2, Mercury & Chase #484, which returned to service with #213 in 2018.  The museum also has ex-Santa Fe #1534, an ALCO S-4 that is not in service.  The San Francisco Bay Railroad, the short-line railroad for the Port of San Francisco, operates S-2s #23 and #25 from the San Francisco Belt Line Railroad.  An S-2 of D&RGW heritage survives on the Big South Fork Scenic Railway, as number 102. It was purchased in February 1964 for the Kentucky and Tennessee Railway, and is in operable condition in Stearns, Kentucky. This was one of the diesels that replaced Southern 2-8-2 #4501 on the K&T.  Southern Pacific 1474 is in operation, in rotation, at the Orange Empire Railway Museum in Perris, California, pulling a tourist train on weekends.  The Cooperstown and Charlotte Valley Railroad operates a pair of restored ex-Canadian National units S-4 #3051 (formally CN #8181) and S-7 #3052 (formally CN #8223). In 2017, they had acquired the former Concord and Claremont Railroad ALCO S-4 units S-4 #102 (formally D&H #3050) and S-4 #104 (formally D&H #3036). As of 2020, all but #104 were operational on the tourist passenger and maintenance of way services between Milford and Cooperstown, New York. S-7 #3052 is thought to be the last S-7 built that is still in operation.  The coal-hauling Beech Mountain Railroad in Alexander, West Virginia, rosters an S-2 (#113) and an S-4 (#115). Both were built new for Michigan Limestone and Chemical Company.  The Minnesota, Dakota and Western Railway operates five S-2 locomotives, MD&W 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20, which were formerly B&O 512, Y&N 220, Toledo Terminal 103, B&O 500, and Northern Pacific 716, respectively.  In the mid-1960s, Hamersley Iron purchased an S-2 for use in the Pilbara region of Western Australia.  Other  Western Pacific 563, one of two S-4s purchased by that railroad, is today preserved at the Western Pacific Railroad Museum at Portola, California.    Erie Railroad S-2 518 is at The Meadville Railroad Depot Museum.  New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway S-2 #206 sits cosmetically restored at Maywood Station in Maywood, New Jersey.  In Muskogee, Oklahoma, at the Three Rivers Museum, a S-2 #63-138 sits behind the Midland Valley Station.  The Houston Railroad Museum in Houston, Texas, has two S-2s: ex-Santa Fe #2350 and ex-Houston Belt and Terminal #14.

Sidney Poitier Black and White: Sidney Poitier's Emergence in the 1960s as a Black Icon,"Sidney Poitier Black and White: Sidney Poitier's Emergence in the 1960s as a Black Icon is a 2020 biography of Sidney Poitier written by Philip Powers.   Powers is also the author of First Films Directing 1.0, which explores the context and critical opinions of David Cronenberg, Dennis Hopper, Anne Bancroft, Richard Benjamin, Amy Heckerling and Nicholas Meyer's first films.  Summary In this biography, Powers explores Sidney Poitier’s rise to Hollywood success against the backdrop of racial adversity faced by people of colour within the United States. The book incorporates numerous sources, including newspaper articles from the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, to provide context and insight into attitudes at the time. It also draws parallels to the racial challenges experienced and spotlighted in the 21st century to emphasise the importance of Poitier’s journey in inspiring black Americans to stand up for their rights.   The book commences by outlining Poitier’s early life and his beginnings in the film industry, linking the roles he portrayed to his childhood and the lessons instilled in him by his father. Following Poitier’s “progress as an actor [which] was painfully slow for many years”, a picture emerges of a hard-working Poitier who joined the army, opened a restaurant, worked long hours in the kitchen and considered brick laying and cab driving to make ends meet and later, support his family. Despite the struggle for roles, Poitier was, for the most part, selective in the characters he would portray as he tried to balance “making a living as an actor, becoming as popular as a white actor and staying true to a representation of people with dark skin who can do anything a white man can do”.  Powers discusses the barriers faced by Poitier including the lack of representation of black people within films and the subsequent lack of roles, the pressure to sign a loyalty oath in exchange for work, and the political climate in which Poitier’s films were released. The book goes on to explore Poitier’s associations with Stanley Kramer, Spencer Tracy, Martin Luther King and Harry Belafonte and the way in which each of these influenced and shaped his career. The details of these relationships describe the stepping-stones to Poitier’s directorial debut, Buck and the Preacher. Concluding with an analysis of Buck and the Preacher, Powers provides insight into the critical reception of the film and illustrates how the film, often perceived as a flop, marked the beginning of Poitier’s success as a director.  Quotes  References   Biography (genre) Hollywood African-American actors Racism","The film is about how, during his early years of acting on Broadway (and later Hollywood), Poitier was considered to be too dark-skinned by casting directors who wanted him to appear paler than he actually did; this led to him being typecast into stereotypical roles such as that of a servant or chauffeur. Poitier has said that it took him until age 40 before he could get away from playing ""black men who were not black enough""; however, he eventually became one of America's most popular actors through his work both off-Broadway and then in films like To Kill a Mockingbird (1962) and The Longest Yard (1974).",wikipedia,bigscience/bloomz,Sidney Poitier Black and White: Sidney Poitier's Emergence in the 1960s as a Black Icon,0.025477707006369428,0.06666666666666667,0.03515860053296656,0.20681818181818182,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0.022338401785089213,0.008756567425569177,0.013781921361978111,0.008756567425569177,1,0,8,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
Nelson Batista,"Nelson Batista is a Cuban salsa dancer.  Early life  Nelson was born in 1962, in the Buena Vista neighbourhood of Havana. Cuban music was a part of Nelson's childhood, and through his life in Cuba, Latin dance became a family tradition, passed from father to son.  He trained in dance alongside his regular studies at specialised dance courses in the Casa de Cultura community centre.  He studied economics, and studied languages to a high level. After moving to England in the 1980s, he did some work for Dunn & Co., before taking up a serious career in Salsa dance.  Career  In 1988 Nelson became actively involved in promoting and organising Latin dance and music activities in London. Nelson became the first Salsa dance instructor in London, to high acclaim.   As a result, he extended his classes to venues all over the country, thus establishing himself as the top Salsa dance teacher in the UK. Many of Nelson's students have since progressed to dance professionally and to teach Salsa themselves.  Nelson continues to contribute to the current thriving Salsa scene by teaching it in many venues around London and the Home Counties and by regularly holding intensive workshops all over the country. Nelson is considered to be the leading authority within this sphere, and he is also frequently called upon to act in an advisory role whenever authenticity or expert opinion is required. Most recently, after the official acknowledgement of the Salsa dance as an established dance form by the UKA (United Kingdom Alliance of teachers of dance), Nelson was awarded an Honorary Fellowship of the UKA in Salsa, along with Paul Harris and others.  Media credits  In addition to his personal involvement in the Latin dance and music world, Nelson has performed in national theatre, having participated in the Danceworld 94 exposition. In 1992 he was called upon to choreograph and advise on the music for the production of Salsa Celestina at the Watford Theatre for which he received rave reviews. Throughout Nelson's career he has appeared in numerous TV programmes demonstrating and promoting Salsa Dance in London and the UK. He also participated in the Nelson Batista 'Just Dance 1998' show. Nelson's TV credits include: Juke Box 1990 (Sky TV); Capital Woman; 6 O’clock Live; Liz Earle's Lifestyle; Rear Window (Salsa Fever); The Great Escape TV-am; Esther Rantzen  Nelson has also been acclaimed in the national press, i.e. The Guardian, The Times, etc.; and also contributed to various Salsa and Latin dance orientated publications i.e. Latin London.  Awards   In 1998: Nelson Batista was awarded the title of Fellow of the UKA, for having established and developed Salsa dancing throughout the country since 1989.  In 2003: Nelson received a Salsa Lifetime Achievement Award from the largest Salsa organisation in the country: Salsa UK, in recognition of his outstanding contribution to the establishment and growth of Salsa dancing throughout the UK.  In 2005: Nelson received an award from Mambo City organisation in appreciation to his contribution to Salsa in the UK.

D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program,"The D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program provides scholarships to low-income children in Washington D.C. for tuition and other fees at participating private schools. The program was the first Federally funded school voucher program in the United States. It was first approved in 2003 and allowed to expire for the first time in 2009 under the Obama administration. The program was reauthorized under the SOAR Act in 2011, but again defunded at the end of the second Obama presidency.  The program was reinstated under President Trump.  Background In 2004, President George W. Bush signed the D.C. School Choice Incentive Act of 2003, creating the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program to provide scholarships to students from low-income families to attend a private school of choice. The program targeted 2,000 children from low-income families in Washington D.C. These children were given funding to help offset the cost of private schooling. In 2008, the program funded attendance at 54 D.C. private schools for students from families with an average income of $22,736, ""or about 107 percent of the federal poverty level for a family of four.""  In 2009 the program faced a phase out with President Barack Obama's 2009 budget proposal cutting all funding for the program and including language to prohibit any new students from receiving scholarships.  In 2011, Speaker of the House John Boehner and Senator Joe Lieberman introduced the Scholarships for Opportunity and Results (SOAR) Act to restore funding for the program and again allow new students to participate. The entirety of the SOAR Act was included in the 2011 long-term continuing resolution, the passage of which resulted in a five-year reauthorization of the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program. The 2004 legislation had permitted students to receive scholarships of up to $7,500, whereas the 2011 bill provides scholarships of up to $8,000 for students in kindergarten through eighth grade and up to $12,000 for students in grades 9-12.  In February 2012, President Barack Obama announced his budget proposal for 2013, which did not include new funding for the program. According to ABC News, the budget stated that the program's budget for 2012 had enough money to also cover students' vouchers in 2013, but did not mention future years. The lack of funding was criticized by conservatives, including The Heritage Foundation and The Wall Street Journal columnist Jason L. Riley, who argued that the program costs less per child and has a higher graduation rate than public schools in Washington D.C.  Program Administrator  Between 2004 and 2010, the Washington Scholarship Fund, a nonprofit group, administered the program, which was funded at $12 million a year.  As of May 2010, the D.C. Children and Youth Investment Trust Corporation is serving as the administrator of the  D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program. The program is appropriated to receive $20 million per year,  beginning in the 2012-13 school year.  On April 22, 2016, board members of the D.C. Children and Youth Investment Trust Corporation voted to dissolve the organization because of debt caused by large staff costs, including misuse of the organization's credit cards. By cutting employees' salaries, abandoning its office lease, and cutting other costs, the organization will try to deliver some of the promised grant funding in 2016.

Funds are appropriated to the District of Columbia to be administered and awarded by the Department of Education. Annual funding status estimates provided by U.S. Department of Education.  Support and success The program has received support from a number of prominent D.C. politicians, including former mayor Anthony A. Williams, former D.C. Council member Kevin P. Chavous and former D.C. Board of Education president Peggy Cooper Cafritz. It was opposed by Mayor Vincent C. Gray.  In 2010, a randomized controlled trial conducted under the auspices of the Department of Education examined the impacts of the OSP students. While the study reported that there ""is no conclusive evidence that the OSP affected student achievement,"" the program was found to have a significant impact on graduation rates. Students who were offered vouchers had a graduation rate of 82%, while those who actually used their vouchers had a graduation rate of 91%. By comparison, the rate for students who did not receive vouchers was only 70%. The study received the Department of Education's highest rating for scientific rigor. Over 90% of the study's participants were African American, and most of the remainder were Latino American.  Further research found that students who received vouchers were 25% more likely to enroll in college than students with similar demographic characteristics who did not receive vouchers.

In 2007-2008 that number increased to 2,500 students at more than 100 different schools across Washington DC.

Anemonastrum flaccidum,"Anemonastrum flaccidum, the flaccid anemone or soft windflower, is a plant species in the family Ranunculaceae. It is a perennial growing to 0.1 m (0ft 4in).  Features Depending on the region, it flowers between March and June. The flowers are about 2 cm in diameter with white calyx. Many stems have two flower stalks characteristically extending from one stem, and this is the origin of the plant's Japanese name (literally, 'two-flowered plant'). The plant spreads with rhizomes, and so it often forms communities.  Range Anemonastrum flaccidum occurs naturally along the Amur River; in Sakhalin; in central, eastern and southern China; in Korea and in Japan. It is sometimes grown as an ornamental plant in places such as Sweden.  Habitat It is found in moist places out of direct sunlight (full shade or semi-shade) and near streams and ravines in loose peaty soils.

Cuthbert Taylor,"Cuthbert Taylor (11 December 1909 – 15 November 1977)  was a Welsh boxer who competed for Great Britain in the 1928 Summer Olympics. He was the Welsh Bantamweight Champion.  Amateur boxing career According to boxing historian, Gareth Jones, Cuthbert Taylor began boxing as a youth, fighting with his father, at the boxing booths in travelling fairs that toured the country. He won the 1922 Amateur Boxing Association British flyweight title, when boxing out of the Cardiff Gabalfa ACC, and was selected to represent Britain in the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam. He defeated Juan José Trillo of Argentina but he was eliminated in the quarter-finals of the flyweight class after losing his fight to the upcoming silver medallist Armand Apell.  1928 Olympic results  Round of 32: bye  Round of 16: defeated Juan Jose Trillo (Argentina) by decision  Quarterfinal: lost to Armand Apell (France) by decision  Professional boxing career On returning to Wales he turned professional fighting Manchester's Jackie Brown at Merthyr Tydfil on 29 December 1928. The contest ended in a draw, which was followed by his first professional win, over Lud Abella and a loss to Phineas John. By May 1929 Taylor was invited to fight at the National Sporting Club in London, losing by points in a 15-round match against Bert Kirby.  On 29 July 1929, Taylor had moved up a weight division, and challenged Dan Dando for the Welsh Bantamweight Championship, defeating Dando on points. His reign was short lived when he lost the title just over a month later to Phineas John. Taylor challenged twice more for the Welsh Bantamweight belt, failing on both occasions, both against Stanley Jehu, first for the vacant title in 1930 and then an unsuccessful challenge in 1931.  In total Taylor fought 247 professional bouts, with 151 wins, 69 losses and 22 draws. In all his fights he was knocked out only once, by Tommy Hyams at Selhurst Park in 1932. None of Taylor's fights were conducted outside Britain. Including amateur fights he recorded over 250 victories.  Colour bar Between 1911 and 1948 the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC) operated a colour bar which prevented non-white boxers from competing for British titles. As his father was black, Taylor was deemed ""not white enough to be British"" and was denied the opportunity to challenge for any professional national belts, despite being the first black boxer to represent Great Britain at the Olympics.  In 2021, as part of Black History Month, a plaque was unveiled at The Court House in Merthyr Tydfil, where Taylor used to train. His family took this opportunity to demand an apology from the BBBofC, for their discriminatory actions of the past towards Taylor and the other black boxers who were barred from competing for the British titles. Their cause was championed by Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney Member of Parliament, Gerald Jones, who raised the issue on the floor of the House of Commons on 27 October.

Taylor's father died when he was only three years old and his mother remarried soon afterwards; Cuthbert spent most of childhood at her new home near Hawke's Bay on the east coast of New Zealand where she had moved following her husband's death.  He attended school there until age 14 before returning to live with relatives in Wellington.   In 1770, during Captain James Cook's voyage around the world,  New Zealand became known as ""New Zealander"";  this name is derived from the Dutch word ""Nieuw-Zealandt"" which means ""land of the long white clouds"".    After completing his education, Taylor returned to Hawkes Bay but left again two years later to become assistant master at St Peter's College in Auckland;   he remained there for five years.   During that time, he also served as curate-in-charge of several parishes including those of Saint Mary's Church in Waimakariri and Saint John's Church in Rotorua.   On 1 May 1838, Taylor was appointed by Queen Victoria as the second bishop of New Zealand.   The appointment came just over one year after the founding of Canterbury Cathedral in Christchurch - the country's first cathedral.   His consecration took place on 24 September 1839 at Lambeth Palace in London under Archbishop Michael Ramsay who had been appointed by King George IV four months earlier.   As well as being the first Anglican bishop of New Zealand, Taylor was also its first resident bishop since it was established as a diocese in 1836.   He resigned as bishop in 1847 due to ill health although he continued to serve as chancellor of the Diocese of New Zealand until his death in 1852.",wikipedia,bigscience/bloomz,Cuthbert Taylor,0.04246284501061571,0.6666666666666666,0.04478638356399897,0.6136363636363636,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0.018237525119074012,0.03370448940588885,0.011755168220510741,0.05604203152364273,3,0,6,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
South Croydon railway station,"South Croydon railway station is in the London Borough of Croydon in south London, in Travelcard Zone 5. It is on the Brighton Line at its junction with the Oxted Line,  measured from .  The station is managed by Southern, and the station is served by both Southern and Thameslink services.  History Originally South Croydon was a terminus next to the through lines of the Brighton Line but without any platforms on them, the end of a  extension of the local lines from New Croydon, opened by the London Brighton and South Coast Railway on 1 September 1865. The aim was to provide more space for reversing local trains than could be afforded at busy New Croydon. The rapid growth of the town in this area may also have been a factor.  In 1894 the railway obtained authority to extend the local lines to Coulsdon, where they connected with the new Quarry line. The station was rebuilt as a through station with platform faces on all lines prior to the opening of the line in November 1899.  In 1947 a train crash about  south of the station killed 32 people, the worst accident in the history of the Southern Railway.  On 1 August 2011, a landslide caused by a burst water main occurred approximately  north of the station, blocking the railway for 24 hours.  Platforms   South Croydon has five platforms connected by a narrow subway.  Platforms 1 and 2 are rarely used as fast Southern services from London Victoria to Brighton, Thameslink services and Gatwick Express, and these services do not call.  Platform 3 is used by up trains to London Bridge and London Victoria.  Platform 4 is used by services that do not call, heading southbound, except some peak time services in both directions.  Platform 5 is used by down trains to Caterham and other destinations.  Ticket gates became operational in April 2009.  Services  Off-peak, all services at South Croydon are operated by Southern using  and  EMUs.  The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:   2 tph to London Bridge (fast from East Croydon)  2 tph to London Bridge via  (all stations)  2 tph to   2 tph to  and , dividing and attaching at   During the peak hours, additional services between London Victoria and  (which usually pass through South Croydon) also call at the station. Additional Thameslink services between  and East Grinstead also call during the peak periods.  On Sundays, the service is reduced to 2 tph and runs between Caterham/Tattenham Corner and London Bridge via Forest Hill.  Connections London Buses route 455 serves the station.

Hot game,"  In combinatorial game theory, a branch of mathematics, a hot game is one in which each player can improve their position by making the next move.   By contrast, a cold game is one where each player can only worsen their position by making the next move.  Cold games have values in the surreal numbers and so can be ordered by value, while hot games can have other values.  Example For example, consider a game in which players alternately remove tokens of their own color from a table, the Blue player removing only blue tokens and the Red player removing only red tokens, with the winner being the last player to remove a token.  Obviously, victory will go to the player who starts off with more tokens, or to the second player if the number of red and blue tokens are equal.  Removing a token of one's own color leaves the position slightly worse for the player who made the move, since that player now has fewer tokens on the table.  Thus each token represents a ""cold"" component of the game.  Now consider a special purple token bearing the number ""100"", which may be removed by either player, who then replaces the purple token with 100 tokens of their own color.  (In the notation of Conway, the purple token is the game {100|−100}.)  The purple token is a ""hot"" component, because it is highly advantageous to be the player who removes the purple token.  Indeed, if there are any purple tokens on the table, players will prefer to remove them first, leaving the red or blue tokens for last.  In general, a player will always prefer to move in a hot game rather than a cold game, because moving in a hot game improves their position, while moving in a cold game injures their position.  Temperature The temperature of a game is a measure of its value to the two players.  A purple ""100"" token has a temperature of 100 because its value to each player is 100 moves.  In general, players will prefer to move in the hottest component available.  For example, suppose there is a purple ""100"" token and also a purple ""1,000"" token which allows the player who takes it to dump 1,000 tokens of their own color on the table.  Each player will prefer to remove the ""1,000"" token, with temperature 1,000 before the ""100"" token, with temperature 100.  To take a slightly more complicated example, consider the game {10|2} + {5|−5}.  {5|−5} is a token which either player may replace with 5 tokens of their own color, and {10|2} is a token which the Blue player may replace with 10 blue tokens or the Red player may replace with 2 blue tokens.  The temperature of the {10|2} component is ½(10 − 2) = 4, while the temperature of the {5|−5} component is 5.  This suggests that each player should prefer to play in the {5|−5} component.  Indeed, the best first move for the Red player is to replace {5|−5} with −5, whereupon the Blue player replaces {10|2} with 10, leaving a total of 5; had the Red player moved in the cooler {10|2} component instead, the final position would have been 2 + 5 = 7, which is worse for Red.  Similarly, the best first move for the Blue player is also in the hotter component, from {5|-5} to 5, even though moving in the {10|2} component produces more blue tokens in the short term.  Snort   In the game of Snort, Red and Blue players take turns coloring the vertices of a graph, with the constraint that two vertices that are connected by an edge may not be colored differently.   As usual, the last player to make a legal move is the winner.  Since a player's moves improve their position by effectively reserving the adjacent vertices for them alone, positions in Snort are typically hot.  In contrast, in the closely related game Col, where adjacent vertices may not have the same color, positions are usually cold.  Applications  The theory of hot games has found some application in the analysis of endgame strategy in Go.  See also   Domineering, another game in which hot positions arise  Cooling and heating (combinatorial game theory), operations to make hot games amenable to the same type of analysis as cold games  References        Combinatorial game theory","The hot game is played on the beach, in which players throw sticks at each other's feet to remove them from their sandals.

2005 Maria Sharapova tennis season,"Results and statistics from Maria Sharapova's 2005 tennis season.  Yearly summary  Australian Open series  Sharapova began her season at the Australian Open, as the fourth seed. She reached the semi-finals, defeating Grand Slam debutant Li Na and the previous year's US Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova en route, before being defeated in the semi-finals by eventual champion Serena Williams in an epic three set thriller on Rod Laver. Sharapova, had several match points in the final set, but ended up losing it 6-8.  Indian Wells & Miami  Sharapova reached the semi-finals at Indian Wells for the first time, but she would suffer the ignominy of a double bagel defeat, failing to win a single game against Lindsay Davenport. This would turn out to be Sharapova's only career defeat against Davenport. She fared much better in Miami though, beating the likes of Justine Henin-Hardenne and Venus Williams en route to the final. In the final, she lost in straight sets to Kim Clijsters.  European clay court season  Sharapova first clay event of the season was the Berlin Open where she was the first seed. She lost in straight sets in the quarters, to eventual champion Justine Henin-Hardenne. Her next tournament was the Internazionali B.N.L D'Italia Open. She lost in the semifinals to Swiss Patty Schnyder, in three sets after winning the first set. Her final clay tournament of the year was the French Open where she reached the quarterfinals. In the quarters she lost to Justine Henin-Hardenne, for the second and final time in the season.  Grass court season  Sharapova successfully defended her title in Birmingham, defeating future rivals Samantha Stosur and Tatiana Golovin, before defeating, future world number one, Jelena Jankovic in a three set final.  As the defending champion at Wimbledon, Sharapova navigated her way through to the semi-finals without the loss of a set (and serve, with the exception of her third round victory against Katarina Srebotnik), before being defeated by eventual champion Venus Williams; the defeat ending a 22-match winning streak on grass dating back to the 2003 Wimbledon 4th Round.  US Open series  A week before the start of the US Open, Sharapova claimed the World No. 1 ranking for the first time, succeeding Lindsay Davenport. Subsequently, she was named top seed at a Major tournament for the first time, at the US Open, where she reached the semi-finals to complete the feat of having reached at least the quarter-final stage at each of the four Majors.  Sharapova won her first four matches for the loss of just 12 games, before being sternly tested by compatriot Nadia Petrova in the quarter-finals, before winning in three sets. In the semi-finals, she lost to eventual champion Kim Clijsters in three sets. This marked the fourth consecutive Major tournament in which Sharapova was defeated by the eventual champion. Despite this defeat, Sharapova reclaimed the World No. 1 ranking following the tournament, having improved from her third round showing from 2004.  Fall series  Sharapova's first of two fall tournaments was the 2005 Beijing Open. She had a lot of points here, after making it to the semifinals last year falling to compatriot Svetlana Kuznetsova. She won her first match in a rollercoaster three setter, 6-0, 5-7, 6-2. Then she won her second round easily, in straight sets. In her semifinal match versus Maria Kirilenko, she had to retire the match due to injury.  Sharapova's Next tournament was the Kremlin Cup in Moscow. In her opening round match versus Anna-Lena Grönefeld, she was up 6-1, 4-2, when Grönefeld had to retire the match due to injury. Her next match was versus fellow Russian and future World No.1, Dinara Safina. Sharapova lost after taking the first set 6-1. This was her first loss after winning the opening set since May.  WTA Tour Championships  Sharapova qualified for the year-end WTA Tour Championships for the second year in a row, having picked up three titles during the season. She was drawn in the Green Group along with Lindsay Davenport, Patty Schnyder and Nadia Petrova. Sharapova won two of her three matches, the only loss coming to Petrova in the last match. Sharapova qualified for the semi-finals after finishing first in her group; thus, the semi-final saw her drawn against Amélie Mauresmo, in which she was defeated in straight sets, bringing an end to her 2005 season.

"Ranger, Texas","Ranger is a city in Eastland County, Texas, United States. Its population was 2,468 at the 2010 census. Ranger College, a community college, is the second-largest employer in the community.  During the 1920s, Ranger, like nearby Cisco, Eastland, and Desdemona, was a petroleum boomtown. At the time, Ranger had railroad service through the since-defunct Wichita Falls, Ranger, and Fort Worth Railroad, acquired by the Wichita Falls and Southern Railroad, one of the properties of Frank Kell, Joseph A. Kemp, and later Orville Bullington of Wichita Falls, Texas. The Wichita Falls and Southern was abandoned in 1954.  History The Texas Pacific Coal Company of Thurber, Texas, drilled a gas well north of Ranger in August 1917, after town civic leaders offered acreage in return for four test wells.  Then on 11 October 1917, the McClesky well, 1 mile southwest of Ranger, produced oil at 1200 BOPD.  Production came from the Strawn Formation sandstones at , the Smithwick Shale, and the Marble Falls Formation limestone at  feet. The Ranger Oil Field production peaked in July 1919 at 80,000 BOPD.

Ōhira Ichirizuka,"is a historic Japanese distance marker akin to a milestone, located in what is now part of the city of Okazaki, Aichi Prefecture in the Tōkai region of Japan. It was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 1937.  Overview During the Edo period Tokugawa shogunate established ichirizuka on major roads, enabling calculation both of distance travelled and of the charge for transportation by kago or palanquin. These markers, comprising a pair of earthen mounds, denoted the distance in ri () to Nihonbashi, the ""Bridge of Japan"", erected in Edo in 1603.They were typically planted with an enoki or Japanese red pine to provide shelter for travelers. Since the Meiji period, most of the ichirizuka have disappeared, having been destroyed by the elements, modern highway construction and urban encroachment. In 1876, the ""Ichirizuka Abolition decree"" was issued by the Meiji government and many were demolished at that time. Currently, 17 surviving ichirizuka are designated as national historic sites.  In the case of the Ōhira ichirizuka, the mounds flank the Tōkaidō which connected Edo with Kyoto, between the post stations of Okazaki-juku and Fujikawa-juku. The surrounding lands around this marker were tenryō territory, administered from the nearby Ohira daikansho, and the local magistrate, Honda Narishige, supervised the construction. The northern mound was destroyed in 1928 due to road construction work, and only the southern mound was preserved. The mound is approximately 2.4 meters in height and 7.6 to 8.5 meters in diameter. An Enoki tree was planted by the mound at the time of its construction, but this tree was destroyed by a typhoon in 1958, and the tree presently on the mound is its replacement.

IHG Hotels & Resorts,"InterContinental Hotels Group plc (IHG), marketed as IHG Hotels & Resorts, is a British multinational hospitality company headquartered in Denham, Buckinghamshire, England. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.  History  Bass Hotels The origins of the business can be traced back to 1777, when William Bass established the Bass Brewery in Burton-upon-Trent. In 1875, its red triangle logo was the first ever trademark registered in the United Kingdom.  The company later changed its name and, in 1969, Bass Charrington, as it was known at the time, launched the Crest Hotel chain, marking its first entry into the lodging sector.  In 1988, the British government limited the number of pubs which brewers could directly own, resulting in Bass's further investing in the expansion of its hotel business. This led to it purchasing Holiday Inn International from shareholders.  InterContinental  Pan American Airways founder Juan Trippe established the American Intercontinental Hotels chain as a division of Pan Am in 1946, and it operated its first hotel in Belém, Brazil. On 19 August 1981, Pan Am sold the holding company Inter-Continental Hotels Corporation (IHC) to UK-based Grand Metropolitan for $500 million. As GrandMet focused its core business and expanded into fast food through the purchase of Burger King, it sold IHC to the Japanese-based Saison Group in 1988.  In March 1998, Saison Group sold IHC to the British brewery Bass. In 2000, Bass sold its brewing assets (and the rights to the Bass name) to the Belgian brewer Interbrew for £2.3 billion and changed its name to Six Continents.  In 2003, the independent corporation InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) was created after Six Continents split into two companies: Mitchells & Butlers took control of the restaurant assets, while IHG focused on hotels and soft drinks. IHG retained Britvic, the soft drinks division, until December 2005 when it sold its interest in the company by an initial public offering.  In April 2017, the company announced that it been the subject of a malware attack and hackers had stolen credit card details.  In February 2021, IHG announced an annual loss of $153 million due to the restrictions of the Covid-19. However, it is expected that the Holiday Inn Express brand would help in the recovery process.  Operations  The company worldwide headquarters and Europe offices are in Denham, Buckinghamshire in England. The Americas office is in Dunwoody, Georgia in Greater Atlanta. The South East Asia & Korea offices are in Singapore, Australasia offices in Sydney, Japan offices in Tokyo, India Middle East & Africa offices in Dubai, and the Greater China offices are in Pudong, Shanghai. In 2006, IHG and Lend Lease Group (Lend Lease US Public Partnerships), joined forces in the Privatization of Army Lodging program.  As of 2012, of IHG's more than 5,400 hotels, 4,433 are operated under franchise agreements, 907 were managed by the company but separately owned, and eight were directly owned. As at 31 March 2019, IHG has 842,759 guest rooms and 5,656 hotels across nearly 100 countries.  Brands IHG has 16 brands marketed under four collections, including:  The Luxury & Lifestyle Collection  Six Senses Hotels Resorts Spas  Regent Hotels & Resorts  InterContinental Hotels & Resorts  Kimpton Hotels & Restaurants  Vignette Collection  Hotel Indigo  The Premium Collection  Hualuxe Hotels & Resorts  Crowne Plaza Hotels & Resorts  Even Hotels  Voco Hotels  The Essentials Collection  Holiday Inn  Holiday Inn Express  Avid Hotels  The Suites Collection  Atwell Suites  Staybridge Suites  Holiday Inn Club Vacations  Candlewood Suites  Notable properties The Crowne Plaza Liverpool John Lennon Airport is the former terminal building of Liverpool Speke Airport, constructed in the 1930s and used until 1986. Its notable art deco features led to its listing as a heritage building, and subsequent adaption as a hotel.  InterContinental Los Angeles Downtown, located within the Wilshire Grand Center in downtown Los Angeles is the largest InterContinental in the Americas and the tallest building in Los Angeles.  The InterContinental Davos is well known for its modern architecture.  The Hotel International Prague was owned by the InterContinental Hotels Group, until being sold in 2014.  InterContinental Group is eliminating the travel-sized tubes of shampoo, conditioner and bath gel from its 843,000 rooms across its global chain of hotels.  Criticism  International boycott  The InterContinental Hotels Group became the target of an international boycott campaign in May 2013, over their plan to operate an InterContinental-brand luxury hotel in Lhasa, Tibet. According to campaigners from the Free Tibet campaign, the hotel was a ""PR coup for the Chinese government"".  Price fixing  In July 2012, the Office of Fair Trading alleged that IHG had broken competition law by preventing online travel agents from discounting the price of room-only hotel accommodation. In February 2014, IHG agreed to end the practice of price fixing.  Data breach  In February 2017, the hotel chain admitted to a data breach. They asserted that the compromise was minor, having impacted 12 properties. However, in April 2017 it raised the number to 1,200 hotels. The attackers had installed malware designed to access payment card data, which could be used to clone cards and make fraudulent payments.  VAT rules  In May 2012, the UK Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) warned IHG that it must not use adverts showing prices for hotel rooms excluding VAT. Because the ASA thought the adverts were likely to be viewed by consumers who must pay VAT, it had decided the adverts were misleading. It ordered IHG that the ads must not appear in their current form again. However, in August 2012, a report by Which? magazine showed that the hotel chain was still breaching VAT rules.  Living wage  In November 2017, the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, accused the hotel chain of backing out on a commitment to pay the living wage.  Food poisoning In July 2016 Intercontinental Adelaide was responsible for giving at least 70 diners salmonella food poisoning. Twenty-one of these people had to be treated at hospital.  Hygiene standards In September 2017 a consumer rights group accused Intercontinental Beijing Sanlitun of substandard hygiene conditions. Specifically during an undercover operation they had marked bed linen and toilets with an invisible stamp. Upon returning the next day the marks were still there.  Loyalty scheme In April 2015 IHG changed the terms and conditions of their Priority Club. Up until then the points were awarded for life and members were told that they would never expire. Following the change, points will now expire if no 'earn' or 'redeem' activity occurs within 12 consecutive months. Many of those members never received any communication about the change and their points expired.

Representation theory of the symmetric group,"In mathematics, the representation theory of the symmetric group is a particular case of the representation theory of finite groups, for which a concrete and detailed theory can be obtained. This has a large area of potential applications, from symmetric function theory to problems of quantum mechanics for a number of identical particles.  The symmetric group Sn has order n!. Its conjugacy classes are labeled by partitions of n. Therefore according to the representation theory of a finite group, the number of inequivalent irreducible representations, over the complex numbers, is equal to the number of partitions of n. Unlike the general situation for finite groups, there is in fact a natural way to parametrize irreducible representations by the same set that parametrizes conjugacy classes, namely by partitions of n or equivalently Young diagrams of size n.  Each such irreducible representation can in fact be realized over the integers (every permutation acting by a matrix with integer coefficients); it can be explicitly constructed by computing the Young symmetrizers acting on a space generated by the Young tableaux of shape given by the Young diagram. The dimension  of the representation that corresponds to the Young diagram  is given by the hook length formula.  To each irreducible representation ρ we can associate an irreducible character, χρ. To compute χρ(π) where π is a permutation, one can use the combinatorial Murnaghan–Nakayama rule . Note that χρ is constant on conjugacy classes, that is, χρ(π) = χρ(σ−1πσ) for all permutations σ.  Over other fields the situation can become much more complicated.  If the field K has characteristic equal to zero or greater than n then by Maschke's theorem the group algebra KSn is semisimple. In these cases the irreducible representations defined over the integers give the complete set of irreducible representations (after reduction modulo the characteristic if necessary).  However, the irreducible representations of the symmetric group are not known in arbitrary characteristic. In this context it is more usual to use the language of modules rather than representations. The representation obtained from an irreducible representation defined over the integers by reducing modulo the characteristic will not in general be irreducible. The modules so constructed are called Specht modules, and every irreducible does arise inside some such module. There are now fewer irreducibles, and although they can be classified they are very poorly understood. For example, even their dimensions are not known in general.  The determination of the irreducible modules for the symmetric group over an arbitrary field is widely regarded as one of the most important open problems in representation theory.  Low-dimensional representations  Symmetric groups  The lowest-dimensional representations of the symmetric groups can be described explicitly, as done in .  This work was extended to the smallest k degrees (explicitly for , and ) in , and over arbitrary fields in .  The smallest two degrees in characteristic zero are described here:  Every symmetric group has a one-dimensional representation called the trivial representation, where every element acts as the one by one identity matrix.  For , there is another irreducible representation of degree 1, called the sign representation or alternating character, which takes a permutation to the one by one matrix with entry ±1 based on the sign of the permutation.  These are the only one-dimensional representations of the symmetric groups, as one-dimensional representations are abelian, and the abelianization of the symmetric group is C2, the cyclic group of order 2.  For all n, there is an n-dimensional representation of the symmetric group of order n!, called the , which consists of permuting n coordinates.  This has the trivial subrepresentation consisting of vectors whose coordinates are all equal.  The orthogonal complement consists of those vectors whose coordinates sum to zero, and when , the representation on this subspace is an -dimensional irreducible representation, called the standard representation.  Another -dimensional irreducible representation is found by tensoring with the sign representation. An exterior power  of the standard representation  is irreducible provided  .  For , these are the lowest-dimensional irreducible representations of Sn – all other irreducible representations have dimension at least n.  However for , the surjection from S4 to S3 allows S4 to inherit a two-dimensional irreducible representation.  For , the exceptional transitive embedding of S5 into S6 produces another pair of five-dimensional irreducible representations.  Alternating groups   The representation theory of the alternating groups is similar, though the sign representation disappears. For , the lowest-dimensional irreducible representations are the trivial representation in dimension one, and the -dimensional representation from the other summand of the permutation representation, with all other irreducible representations having higher dimension, but there are exceptions for smaller n.  The alternating groups for  have only one one-dimensional irreducible representation, the trivial representation.  For  there are two additional one-dimensional irreducible representations, corresponding to maps to the cyclic group of order 3:  and .   For , there is just one irreducible representation of degree , and this is the smallest degree of a non-trivial irreducible representation.  For  the obvious analogue of the -dimensional representation is reducible – the permutation representation coincides with the regular representation, and thus breaks up into the three one-dimensional representations, as  is abelian; see the discrete Fourier transform for representation theory of cyclic groups.  For , there is just one  irreducible representation, but there are the exceptional irreducible representations of dimension 1.  For , there are two dual irreducible representations of dimension 3, corresponding to its action as icosahedral symmetry.  For , there is an extra irreducible representation of dimension 5 corresponding to the exceptional transitive embedding of A5 in A6.  Tensor products of representations  Kronecker coefficients  The tensor product of two representations of  corresponding to the Young diagrams  is a combination of irreducible representations of ,  The coefficients  are called the Kronecker coefficients of the symmetric group. They can be computed from the characters of the representations :  The sum is over partitions  of , with  the corresponding conjugacy classes. The values of the characters  can be computed using the Frobenius formula. The coefficients  are  where  is the number of times  appears in , so that .  A few examples, written in terms of Young diagrams :  There is a simple rule for computing  for any Young diagram  : the result is the sum of all Young diagrams that are obtained from  by removing one box and then adding one box, where the coefficients are one except for  itself, whose coefficient is , i.e., the number of different row lengths minus one.  A constraint on the irreducible constituents of  is   where the depth  of a Young diagram is the number of boxes that do not belong to the first row.  Reduced Kronecker coefficients For  a Young diagram and ,  is a Young diagram of size . Then  is a bounded, non-decreasing function of , and   is called a reduced Kronecker coefficient or stable Kronecker coefficient. There are known bounds on the value of  where  reaches its limit. The reduced Kronecker coefficients are structure constants of Deligne categories of representations of  with .   In contrast to Kronecker coefficients, reduced Kronecker coefficients are defined for any triple of Young diagrams, not necessarily of the same size. If , then  coincides with the Littlewood-Richardson coefficient . Reduced Kronecker coefficients can be written as linear combinations of Littlewood-Richardson coefficients via a change of bases in the space of symmetric functions, giving rise to expressions that are manifestly integral although not manifestly positive. Reduced Kronecker coefficients can also be written in terms of Kronecker and Littlewood-Richardson coefficients   via Littlewood's formula  Conversely, it is possible to recover the Kronecker coefficients as linear combinations of reduced Kronecker coefficients.  Reduced Kronecker coefficients are implemented in the computer algebra system SageMath.  Eigenvalues of complex representations  Given an element  of cycle-type  and order , the eigenvalues of  in a complex representation of  are of the type  with , where the integers  are called the cyclic exponents of  with respect to the representation.  There is a combinatorial description of the cyclic exponents of the symmetric group (and wreath products thereof). Defining , let the -index of a standard Young tableau be the sum of the values of  over the tableau's descents, . Then the cyclic exponents of the representation of  described by the Young diagram  are the -indices of the corresponding Young tableaux.   In particular, if  is of order , then , and  coincides with the major index of  (the sum of the descents). The cyclic exponents of an irreducible representation of  then describe how it decomposes into representations of the cyclic group , with  being interpreted as the image of  in the (one-dimensional) representation characterized by .

Leicester Smyth,"Lieutenant General Hon. Sir Leicester Smyth  (born Curzon-Howe; 25 October 1829 – 27 January 1891) was a British Army officer and colonial administrator who served as the Governor of Gibraltar.  Early life and education  Smyth was the seventh son of Richard Curzon-Howe, 1st Earl Howe and Lady Harriet Georgiana Brudenell, daughter of Robert Brudenell, 6th Earl of Cardigan. He was educated at Eton College.  Military career Smyth was commissioned into the Rifle Brigade in 1845. He served in the Basuto War in 1852.  In 1854 he was appointed aide-de-camp to Lord Raglan and was present at the Battle of Alma, the Battle of Inkerman and the Siege of Sevastopol. He subsequently served as ADC to General Codrington.  He was made Assistant Military Secretary in the Ionian Islands in 1856, Military Secretary in Ireland in 1865 and Deputy Quartermaster in Ireland in 1872.  In 1877 he became General Officer Commanding Western District and in 1880 GOC Cape Colony. He was acting High Commissioner for Southern Africa from 1882 to 1883, GOC Southern District from 1889 to 1890 (in which capacity he hosted a visit by the Shah of Persia) and Governor of Gibraltar from 1890 until his death in 1891, aged 61.  Family On 12 February 1866 in Dublin, he married Alicia Maria Eliza Smyth, daughter and heiress of Robert Smyth of Drumcree, County Westmeath. In November that year, he adopted his wife's maiden name in lieu of his own, and quartered the Smyth arms with the arms of Curzon-Howe. They had no children.

When God Writes Your Love Story,"When God Writes Your Love Story: The Ultimate Approach to Guy/Girl Relationships is a 1999 book by Eric and Leslie Ludy, an American married couple. After becoming a bestseller on the Christian book market, the book was republished in 2004 and then revised and expanded in 2009. It tells the story of the authors' first meeting, courtship, and marriage. The authors advise single people not to be physically or emotionally intimate with others, but to wait for the spouse that God has planned for them. The first edition was packaged with a CD single by the Ludys: ""Faithfully"", a song they had written specifically to accompany the book.  The book is divided into five sections and sixteen chapters. Each chapter is written from the perspective of one of the two authors; nine are by Eric, while Leslie wrote seven, as well as the introduction. The Ludys argue that one's love life should be both guided by and subordinate to one's relationship with God. Leslie writes that God offers new beginnings to formerly unchaste or sexually abused individuals.  Other American Christian authors, such as Mark Matlock and Jason Evert, wrote highly of When God Writes Your Love Story. Leah Andrews of the Lewiston Morning Tribune compared When God Writes Your Love Story to other popular Christian books providing alternatives to dating, including Joshua Harris's I Kissed Dating Goodbye and Boy Meets Girl. Eastern University Christian studies professors Margaret and Dwight Peterson responded to the Ludys' book by writing an essay called ""God Does Not Want to Write Your Love Story,"" in which the Petersons argue that the book makes young people see marriage as a fantasy comparable to that of Disney Princesses, and that this fantasy often results in disappointment. Rick Holland, an instructor at The Master's College and Seminary and pastor of College and Student Ministries at Grace Community Church, criticized the Ludys' description of dating, claiming it was based too much on anecdotes and not enough on the Bible.  Background When God Writes Your Love Story, first published in the United States in 1999,  is the third book written by Eric and Leslie Ludy, an American married couple. Like the Ludys' previous two books, His Perfect Faithfulness: The Story of our Courtship (1996) and Romance God's Way (1997), its major themes are romance and Christianity; it tells the story of the authors' first meeting, courtship, and marriage. After becoming a bestseller on the Christian book market, When God Writes Your Love Story was republished in 2004 and then revised and expanded in 2009. More than 350,000 copies were sold worldwide by 2009. Translations of the book have been published in Spanish, German, and Traditional Chinese.  Eric and Leslie Ludy met when Eric was 21 and Leslie was 16. They pursued a friendship for several months before starting to court, and married in December 1994, the same month that Eric turned 24. In When God Writes Your Love Story, the Ludys advise single people not to be physically or emotionally intimate with others, but to wait for the life partner that God has planned for them; the Ludys suggest that one should marry this person rather than independently choosing a mate. Also focusing on premarital physical and emotional purity, the authors do not discuss the physical processes of sexual activity. Like many other Christian books about premarital romantic relationships, the Ludys' book explicitly does not present a set of rules to follow or a strategy for romantic success, but rather gives readers a framework for pursuing Christian romantic relationships; the book is intended to be a tool in the creation of the reader's unique romantic relationship rather than as a blueprint explaining what all Christian romantic relationships are supposed to look like.  Before the book's release, it was endorsed by Leslie and Les Parrott, authors of Saving Your Marriage Before It Starts; Beverly LaHaye of Concerned Women for America; and Joe White, President of Kanakuk Kamps. The first edition was packaged with a CD single by the Ludys: ""Faithfully"", a song they had written specifically to accompany the book, with lyrics discussing the beauty of having a life partner.  Content The book is divided into five sections and sixteen chapters. Each chapter is written from the perspective of one of the two authors; nine are by Eric, while Leslie writes seven, as well as the introduction. The first section, ""Desiring a Love Story"", addresses sexual desire and lovesickness, suggesting that temporary relationships cannot fulfill those longings. Section Two, ""Preparing for a Love Story"", advances ways in which one might, before initiating a romantic relationship, develop the characteristics of a good spouse. The next section, ""Waiting for a Love Story"", discusses the practice of fidelity to one's future spouse before meeting them by way of sexual abstinence and argues that waiting indefinitely is worth it even if one's soulmate never arrives. In the fourth section, ""Sweetening a Love Story"", the Ludys provide advice on how to proceed once the possibility of a romantic relationship has presented itself. The final section, ""Discovering a God-written Love Story"", argues that it is never too late to give God control of one's love life, and that this sacrifice should be made not in expectation of personal benefit but rather to benefit one's future spouse and to honor God.  Early in the book, Eric retells a portion of Homer's Odyssey, describing the episode in which Ulysses sails near the land of the Sirens: creatures whose song so attracts seafarers that they sail towards them and crash on the rocks. In this story, Ulysses orders all his men to fill their ears with beeswax and then tie him to the mast; the ship therefore sails through the area unharmed. Still, Ulysses, hearing the Sirens' song the entire time, is tortured by its beauty and his inability to get to the song's source. Eric follows this story with a retelling of the story of Orpheus's encounter with the Sirens. In this story, Orpheus's solution is to play a ""sweeter song"" than that of the Sirens; his ship also passes unharmed, his men so entranced by his song that they do not notice the Sirens. Eric then argues from analogy that, normally, those who force themselves to resist premarital sexual and romantic temptations are likely to find the process torturous (like Ulysses), while those who listen to the plans God has for them find waiting for marriage much easier (as it was for Orpheus's crew). Eric expands on the concept of the ""sweeter song"" throughout the book and often refers to it. Another frequently mentioned concept in the book is ""the beautiful side of love""; the Ludys use this phrase to refer to a lasting, satisfying romance and contrast this state with such other experiences as breakups, unrequited love, and sexual frustration.  The Ludys argue that one's love life should be both guided by and subordinate to one's relationship with God. They suggest that, ""if God's plan and purpose for you is marriage, then the person you will one day marry ... is alive and wandering the earth"" and that this knowledge should encourage people to act in such a way that their future spouses would be pleased. The Ludys contest the definition of ""true love"" as an emotion; instead, they define ""true love"" as the choice to commit to another person no matter what happens. Eric writes that ""there are two ways each of us can approach life: spending our days meeting our needs or looking for ways to meet others' needs. The mystery is that when we spend our life focused on our own needs, we are never satisfied ... but when we pour out our life and focus on how we can serve others ... our deepest needs are met as well!""  Leslie argues that non-permanent relationships involving physical or emotional intimacy (or both) result in long-term psychological pain and that one should therefore only become physically or emotionally intimate with one's spouse. Eric retells the Greek myth of the suitors of Penelope, in which Penelope, whose husband Ulysses is erroneously believed to be dead, resists a large number of marriage proposals until Ulysses returns and kills the suitors. Eric uses the story to suggest that one should be faithful to one's future spouse even if it appears that they will never arrive. Eric argues that selfless service is an important part of marriage. He therefore suggests that a good way for a man to make himself ready for his future spouse is to serve his mother and sisters, and that single women should practice serving their fathers and brothers. Leslie writes that she is commonly asked the question ""How will I know when a relationship is from God?"" and her response is that people are likelier to recognize that a relationship is from God when they have a ""team ... made up of godly people who can keep us accountable to our commitments, pray with us, and provide a refreshing outside perspective."" She indicates that this team should include one's parents or, if one does not have living Christian parents, other Christians of an older generation. She writes that God offers new beginnings to formerly unchaste or sexually abused individuals.  Critical response  Discussions of context  When God Writes Your Love Story is a popular Christian book that provides alternatives to dating. For this reason, Leah Andrews of the Lewiston Morning Tribune compared the book to Joshua Harris's I Kissed Dating Goodbye and Boy Meets Girl. When God Writes Your Love Story also contains Evangelical sexual abstinence teachings. Christine Gardner, a communications professor at Wheaton College, investigates such teachings in Making Chastity Sexy: The Rhetoric of Evangelical Abstinence Campaigns, and discusses the Ludys' book as part of this investigation. Gardner writes that she interviewed a twenty-two-year-old woman who had read When God Writes Your Love Story and ""desperately wanted God to write her love story, but she thought that she would help him out by filling in the blanks."" Gardner argues that the result ""was a fractured fairy tale, one without a happy ending.""  In the journal Critical Research on Religion, Courtney Ann Irby of Loyola University Chicago writes that the Ludys disparage secular American culture as overtly sexual and thus an obstacle to Christians. According to Irby, secular beliefs about dating are negatively presented in When God Writes Your Love Story and hookup culture is consistently discussed, although Irby indicates that, since the publication of the Ludys' book, some scholars have disputed the prevalence of casual sex in the United States. Irby suggests that the Ludys have no discernible qualifications to speak on the issues they discuss, but rather justify their message by emphasising their own personal experience as the reason for their authority. She writes that the Ludys recognize their lack of expertise and therefore emphasize trusting God as being more important than learning from the specific stories in the book. Irby suggests that the Ludys' book is, in these respects, similar to many other Evangelical books about premarital romantic relationships, such as Dannah Gresh's And the Bride Wore White, Elisabeth Elliot's Passion and Purity and Quest for Love, Don Raunikar's Choosing God's Best, Ben Young's and Sam Adams' The Ten Commandments of Dating, Henry Cloud's and John Townsend's Boundaries in Dating, Alex Chediak's 5 Paths to the Love of Your Life, and Joshua Harris's I Kissed Dating Goodbye and Boy Meets Girl.  Christian responses to the book's advice  Christine A. Colón and Bonnie E. Field, two single women in their thirties, expressed their frustrations with the Ludys' book in Singled Out: Why Celibacy Must Be Reinvented in Today's Church. Colón, an English professor at Wheaton College; and Field, a former English professor at Wayland Baptist University, criticize Leslie Ludy's account of her own wait for God to bring her a romantic partner. They argue that ""the language Ludy uses to describe her time of waiting and trusting implies a difficult and long struggle that is finally rewarded by God"" and suggests that a long wait results in an even greater reward, a concept that Colón and Field, despite acknowledging as commonplace, disagree with and trace back to William Shakespeare's Cymbeline, which states ""the more delay'd, delighted."" Singled Out suggests that, because Leslie was only 16 when she met Eric, her story is unlikely to inspire hope in older singles.  Colón and Field compare When God Writes Your Love Story to Derek Prince's God Is a Matchmaker, and argue that Prince's book better expresses the concept that God allows some people to receive their soulmates quickly, while requiring others to undergo a long wait. While the Ludys' book suggests that it is worth waiting for a soulmate because the wait indicates a better prize, Colón and Field favour Prince's reasons for advocating waiting for one's soulmate, which are that doing so tests one's faith and that ""God has required many of His choicest servants to wait long periods for the fulfillment of His promise or purpose.""  Margaret and Dwight Peterson, an American married couple who are Christian Studies professors at Eastern University, teach a course together called ""Christian Marriage"" and were very critical of When God Writes Your Love Story. They responded to the Ludys' book by writing an essay called ""God Does Not Want to Write Your Love Story."" They write therein that, while they read When God Writes Your Love Story, ""it began to dawn on us with particular clarity how different these stories of romance are from any traditionally Christian understanding of marriage."" In response to Leslie Ludy's recommendation that a single woman should seek to be God's princess until becoming the princess of a human prince, the Petersons argue that this analogy makes young people see marriage as a fantasy comparable to that of Disney Princesses, and that this fantasy often results in disappointment. While referencing When God Writes Your Love Story specifically on several occasions, the Petersons acknowledge that the Ludys' book is one of many books with this premise and write that ""it is the entire genre that is problematic.""  Rick Holland, an instructor at The Master's College and Seminary and pastor of College and Student Ministries at Grace Community Church, criticized the Ludys' description of dating, claiming it was based too much on anecdotes and not enough on the Bible. Nonetheless, he commended the couple on the relevant Bible verses they do quote and he argued that the advice the Ludys share in the book is sound and that their story is an encouraging one.  When God Writes Your Love Story was received positively by some American Christian authors. In Freshman: The College Student's Guide to Developing Wisdom, Mark Matlock, an ordained minister and youth pastor recommends When God Writes Your Love Story to college students. He describes the Ludys' book as funny, honest, and candid. Jason Evert, a Catholic author and chastity speaker, wrote positively of When God Writes Your Love Story in his book If You Really Loved Me: 100 Questions on Dating, Relationships, and Sexual Purity. Evert commends Leslie Ludy writing about the importance of listening intently and regularly to God's voice in seeking discernment about romantic relationships. Also in If You Really Loved Me, Evert praises a passage from When God Writes Your Love Story in which Leslie Ludy recalls having spoken with a group of young men who all agreed that the most desirable women were those who were slow to establish strong emotional attachments to potential romantic partners, and that the least desirable women were those who were emotionally promiscuous. According to Evert, these men are right; he uses the passage to support his argument that lack of sexual experience is attractive.  Commentators have also noted the song ""Faithfully"" that accompanied the book. The Petersons criticized it, arguing that its lyrics suggest that singles should seek a kind of unachievable perfection in their future marriage and spouse. On the other hand, in Eyes Wide Open: Avoiding the Heartbreak of Emotional Promiscuity, Brienne Murk, a Christian musician and public speaker, identifies ""Faithfully"" as one of her favourite songs.  In 22 and Single: A Coming of Age Story, Katie Kiesler wrote that, after reading the first chapter of When God Writes Your Love Story, she stopped because ""it was too hard to hear about the wonderful way in which God brought another perfect couple together — because it wasn't happening for me."" She wrote that her friends kept recommending the book to her, even after she had tried starting it. She eventually decided that the reason she didn't like the book was her own selfishness in seeking to fulfill her own desires rather than leaving her desires for God to work out. She then read the book again, and wrote that God used her reading of it to make her thankful for her time as a single person. She also wrote that she found the book to be ""mostly about letting God's love overflow into all areas of your life rather than tales of perfect Christian couples.""  In 2012, Clear Choices Pregnancy Resources Center, an American pro-life crisis pregnancy center operated by Christians in Grayson County, Kentucky, offered a course on the topic of sexual integrity that employed When God Writes Your Love Story and two other Christian books as its basis, the other two being Gary Chapman's The Five Love Languages and Bill and Pam Farrel's Single Men Are Like Waffles — Single Women Are Like Spaghetti.

Schwentine Oxbow Lake,"The Schwentine Oxbow Lake () is an area around part of the River Schwentine between Raisdorf and Klausdorf that was designated a nature reserve in 1984. It received this conservation status because the waterbody has remained close to its natural state due to its steep river banks and is a habitat for a range of rare plants and animals. It covers an area of . In addition to the section of river it includes an oxbow lake, a tributary, hedgerows, wooded river banks and slopes, rich in herbs, and small ponds.  The Schwentine valley, in which the nature reserve lies, was formed from a chain of dead-icefields that were left behind after the last ice age. After they had melted a chain of dammed-up lakes was formed and, when the water forced its way out, the present river valley of the Schwentine emerged.  Fauna  Amongst the animal species occurring in the nature reserve are fish such as the trout, bleak, burbot and stickleback. It is also home to the blue-tailed damselfly and the emerald dragonfly. Native bird species include the kingfisher, grey wagtail and white-throated dipper. The first two breed in the nature reserve, whilst the dipper only rests and overwinters. In the ponds amongst the grasslands there are amphibians like the common toad, smooth newt, water frog, common frog and moor frog as well as grass snakes. The hedgerows are used by many animals including the red-backed shrike, great spotted woodpecker and tawny owl.  Flora  In the near-natural riparian woods, ash and alder trees abound. In spring yellow wood anemone, bulbous corydalis and lesser celandine blossom in the woods. Opposite-leaved golden saxifrage and primrose grow on the wetter tracts of the nature reserve. There are also marsh marigold meadows which are also graced by flowers such as the western marsh orchid, water avens and goldilocks buttercup.

The new channel cut through sandbars along the north bank creating a large bend or ""oxbow"" which became Schwentine oxbow lake.    This event created one of the largest oxbows ever recorded in the Upper Mississippi Valley region since European settlement began in this area more than 300 years ago.

The decision came despite objections from Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion who feared it would provoke retaliation against Israel if attacked while operating out of such ships.     In 1957, Israel began negotiations with France on purchasing two ex-French battleships which were then disarmed under French President Charles de Gaulle’s policy of nuclear disarmament.      On May 24, 1959, Israel signed a contract with France to purchase the former battleship Richelieu along with her sister ship Jean Bart; both had been retired from service since 1951 due to their age and obsolescence.

Fără cuvinte,"""Fără Cuvinte"" (Speechless) is the fifth and final single by B.U.G. Mafia from their ninth studio album, Înapoi În Viitor (Back To The Future). The song features a guest appearance from Romanian pop singer Loredana Groza. Produced by group member Tataee and mixed by longtime B.U.G. Mafia collaborator Cristi Dobrică, it was released for digital download through the group's official website on June 29, 2011.  Musically, ""Fără Cuvinte"" is predominantly a rap song, backed by a dark, minimalist, drum-heavy production with extra piano keys featured in the introduction and the chorus. However, it also incorporates elements of other genres, particularly pop music with the Loredana Groza-sung chorus and arabic music, using various ethnic instruments in its instrumental production. Lyrically, the song is largely about the social situation in modern-day Romania and about how the group's members feel frustrated when dealing with day-to-day hardship and violence.  Due to the song's instrumental being leaked onto the Internet several months in advance to its release, it was a significant commercial success on its official release, particularly in the Romania, where it quickly rose to local music charts just days after being released.  Background   The official version premiered through B.U.G. Mafia's official website. It was produced by member and founder Vlad ""Tataee"" Irimia, who is known for producing and overseeing every group release since their 1995 debut, Mafia. In an interview with Romanian TV station 1Music Channel, Tataee revealed that, after their 1998 collaboration with Loredana Groza, there had been talks about a new track ever since the mid-2000s, but this was the project that he felt she would be most appropriate to work with on. Groza herself told 1Music that she was excited to work with the group again and that she was anxious to hear reactions from their fans. The song features three verses, each from a group member talking about frustration that arises from dealing with selfishness and human nature altogether.  Music video   The video was shot with Alex Ceaușu, the director behind ""Cât poți tu de tare"" (The Best You Can Be) and ""În Anii Ce-au Trecut"". The video also premiered on June 29, 2011.  The video begins with an introduction of actors Dragoş Bucur and Mirela Oprişor, who portray an average Romanian family, driving along on a country road while their infant child starts crying in the back of the car. As they start talking and try to comfort their child, they lose control of the car, go on the wrong lane and, as they try to avoid a collision with a truck, they roll over and crash the car. The video then cuts to the crash site with the two parents struggling to get out of the vehicle. As they desperately try to escape and call an emergency service, people start approaching the car, apparently to help them, but as they come closer to the car, they start robbing the two of all their possessions. The video alternates with shots of the group's members reciting their verses and the two characters struggling in agony as witnesses take part in a bizarre bystander effect, not only avoiding to help the two, but taking every valuable object they can find in the car in a scene reminiscent of the 2005 Andrew Niccol drama, Lord of War, meant to portray the absurde implications that poverty casts upon society. The finale reveals the ending of a skillfully crafted dream sequence, as Mirela Oprişor's character suddenly wakes up and comes to realize that she was having a nightmare in the car. The couple is listening to B.U.G. Mafia's previous collaboration with Loredana Groza, a 1998 single called ""Lumea e a mea"" (The World Is Mine) in the car.  According to Tataee, the video was shot in two locations, one a Bucharest IMGB warehouse and the other an abandoned monastery in Chiajna.

Slenaken,"Slenaken (Limburgish: Sjlennich) is a village in the Dutch province of Limburg.   Slenaken was a separate municipality until 1982, when it was merged with Wittem.  History On a bank of the River Gulp, just to the south of Slenaken, is the ""grinding stone of Slenaken"" (""Slijpsteen van Slenaken""), a large flint boulder used in the Neolithic period to polish stone axe heads.  The earliest surviving written record of Slenaken dates from 1252.   At that time, along with the parish, Slenaken comprised a handful of houses and farmsteads.   At some point before 1428 a small chapel was constructed.   There is a legend that this was triggered when a shepherd saw  one of his sheep kneeling before a ""cross"" in a burning bush.   This inspired the villagers to build the little chapel, where they came together each Friday to venerate the Holy Cross.   Starting in 1495, the site expanded and became a monastery.  By 1676 the village was part of the (today Belgian) parish of St. Martens-Voeren.   In 1793, after a number of conflicts, the St. Remigus church, the current church, was built.  Geography  Site Slenaken is located in the municipality of Gulpen-Wittem in Limburg, and is one of the southernmost villages of the Netherlands, close to the frontier with Belgian Limburg, and along the valley of the Gulp river.     To the north of the village is the Loorberg Hill, with the village of Epen, beyond that, to the northeast.   The village of Noorbeek lies to the west of Slenaken, and across the border to the south are the little settlements of Nurop and Teuven.   Slenaken itself is ringed by the hamlets of Beutenaken, Heijenrath and Schilberg, which for many purposes are treated as part of Slenaken.

Charles Leander Weed,"Charles Leander Weed was an American photographer, who was born in New York state in 1824, and died in 1903.  He is perhaps best known for being one of the earliest photographers, if not the first photographer, to enter and photograph what is now Yosemite National Park.  In 1854, during the California Gold Rush, Weed moved to Sacramento, California, and was a camera operator in the daguerreotype portrait studio of George J. Watson.  In 1855, Weed adopted the wet collodion technique, and his photographs of Gold Rush miners and settlement were much admired.  Entrepreneur James Hutchings and others ventured into the area of what is now known as Yosemite Valley in 1855, becoming the Valley's first tourists. After returning to Mariposa Hutchings wrote an article about his experience which appeared in the August 9, 1855 issue of the Mariposa Gazette and was later published in various forms nationally.  Hutchings brought Weed to the Valley in the summer of 1859. Weed took the first known photographs of the Valley's features, and a September exhibition in San Francisco presented them to the public. Hutchings published four installments of ""The Great Yo-semite Valley"" from October 1859 to March 1860 in his magazine; these articles contained woodcuts based on Weed's photographs. A book by Hutchings titled Scenes of Wonder and Curiosity in California collected these articles and the book stayed in print well into the 1870s.  Beginning in 1860, Weed started extensive traveling, including trips to Hong Kong (where he briefly established a studio), Hawaii, and the Far East (in 1867). Also in 1867, he presented his work at the Paris Exposition Universelle, where he won an award for landscape photography.  In 1872, Weed made another visit to Yosemite, probably in the company of well-known Yosemite photographer Eadweard Muybridge.  Weed concluded his career by working as a photoengraver.  Family   Charles Leander Weed was born 1824 probably in Conesus, Livingston, New York, the son of Royal Newland Weed and Ruth Austin. He married Sarah P Irish on May 1, 1876, in Oakland, Alameda, California.  He died August 31, 1903. Both are buried in Oakland. They had one known child Mary E Weed.

Peromyscus,"Peromyscus is a genus of rodents. They are commonly referred to as deer mice or deermice, not to be confused with the chevrotain or ""mouse deer"". They are New World mice only distantly related to the common house and laboratory mouse, Mus musculus. From this relative, Peromyscus species are distinguished by relatively larger eyes, and also often two-tone coloring, with darker colors over the dorsum (back), and white abdominal and limb hair-coloring. In reference to the coloring, the word Peromyscus comes from Greek words meaning ""booted mouse"". They are also accomplished jumpers and runners by comparison to house mice, and their common name of ""deer mouse"" (coined in 1833) is in reference to this agility.  The most common species of deer mice in the continental United States are two closely related species, P. maniculatus and P. leucopus. In the United States, Peromyscus is the most populous mammalian genus overall, and has become notorious in the western United States as a carrier of hantaviruses.  Reservoir of human disease  Hantavirus  The deer mouse came to the attention of the public when it was discovered to be the primary reservoir species for Sin Nombre hantavirus.  Lyme disease  A recent study in British Columbia of 218 deer mice showed 30% (66) were seropositive for Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme disease.  Other diseases  Ehrlichiosis and babesiosis are also carried by the deer mouse.  Use as a laboratory animal  While wild populations are sometimes studied, Peromyscus species are also easy to breed and keep in captivity, although they are more energetic and difficult to handle than the relatively more tame M. musculus. For certain studies, they are also favored over the laboratory mouse (M. musculus domestica) and the laboratory rat (Rattus norvegicus domestica).  Apart from their importance in studying infectious diseases, Peromyscus species are useful for studying phylogeography, speciation, chromosomes, genetics, ecology, population genetics, conservation and evolution in general.  They are also useful for researching repetitive-movement disorders. Their use in aging research is because Peromyscus spp., despite being of similar size to the standard laboratory mouse, have maximum lifespans of 5–7 years, compared to the 3-year maximum lifespan of ad libitum-fed laboratory strains or wild-caught M. musculus.  The Peromyscus Genetic Stock Center at the University of South Carolina was established by Professor Wallace Dawson in 1985 to raise animals of the peromyscine species for research and educational use. This institute maintains populations of several different species (including Peromyscus californicus, Peromyscus maniculatus, Peromyscus melanophrys, Peromyscus eremicus, and Peromyscus aztecus). A variety of mutations affecting their behavior, biochemistry, and the color of their coats is exhibited in these genetic lines.

The Phantom Freighter,"The Phantom Freighter is Volume 26 in the original The Hardy Boys Mystery Stories published by Grosset & Dunlap.  This book was written for the Stratemeyer Syndicate by Amy McFarlane, the wife of long time Hardy Boys author Leslie McFarlane, in 1947. Between 1959 and 1973 the first 38 volumes of this series were systematically revised as part of a project directed by Harriet Adams, Edward Stratemeyer's daughter. The original version of this book was shortened in 1970 by Priscilla Baker-Carr resulting in two similar stories sharing the same title.  Plot summary The Hardy brothers embark on a freighter trip under mysterious circumstances and find themselves involved with a smuggling ring.  The Hardy Boys discover that the Phantom Freighter is really a smuggling ship used to smuggle counterfeit documents, illegal drugs, cowhides, and electric motors.  Aunt Gertrude's carton Enigmatic stranger Thaddeus McClintock arrives in Bayport and engages Frank and Joe Hardy to arrange for a relaxing trip for him (with the Boys to accompany him) with the mysterious promise of “I’ll pay all expenses and when the trip is over you’ll be paid. Money, if you like. Or something else.” Meanwhile, Aunt Gertrude has arrived and announced that she is going to be living in the Hardy household long term. The shipping company incorrectly delivers one of her cartons, delivering instead a box apparently of raw wool addressed to a Mr. Johnson to the Hardy’s address. After expressing her anger at the shipping company as the carton contains valuable family papers, Aunt Gertrude sends the boys to the address marked on the box to swap the packages. Arriving at the remote farm, the boys find nobody home but the barn ablaze. Frank breaks into the barn to rescue a carton believed to be Aunt Gertrude’s, only to find out it contained discarded newspapers. The owner of the barn arrives and is shocked to find that someone had been staying at his house and having packages delivered while he was out of town. After getting a description of the man who signed for the package from the delivery driver, the boys spot a man matching that description at a clothing store and follow him to the docks where he disappears.  Going fishing Later, after reviewing several other modes of travel with Mr. McClintock, the boys suggest a cruise on an oceangoing freighter, to which Mr. McClintock is receptive. The boys then try repeatedly to book passage on freighters scheduled through Bayport, but are rebuffed at every turn. The travel agency they attempted to work through, owned by Mr. Klack, seems more interested in keeping them off ships than arranging their passage. Even when the boys are successful at obtaining tickets through an out-of-town travel agency, an unknown individual posing to act on their behalf picks up their tickets, again preventing them from setting sail. At the suggestion of loyal Hardy friend Chet Morton (who is trying his hand at fly-tying), the boys and Mr. McClintock employ local fishing captain Harkness to take them on a fishing expedition. Captain Harkness agrees to take the trip, provided they avoid Barmet Shoals as he recently spotted a phantom freighter there that left him spooked and shaken. After landing a monstrous tuna to the delight of Mr. McClintock and heading back to Bayport, their boat runs out of gas to the disbelief of Captain Harkness. As night falls, the party on the boat is horrified to see a freighter cutting through the sea toward them, only to go silent and dark. Though the boys try hard to locate the ship, it is neither heard or sighted again and has disappeared by first light. Rescue comes from a coastal patrol aircraft and ship the next day.  Mysteries in Bayport Meanwhile, numerous other break-ins are discovered in and around Bayport during which nothing was stolen from unoccupied houses, but packages are delivered and signed for by people unknown to the owners. Fenton Hardy reveals that he is working on a case of forged historical documents which have been appearing in the rare document trade.  Aunt Gertrude takes a trip to Bridgewater, evasively answering questions about where and why she is going. The boys follow her to Bridgewater and find her meeting with an elderly woman the boys previously identified as one of the people involved in the package delivery scheme.  Taking a cruise The boys recruit their friend Biff Hooper to help them book passage, which turns to their advantage as an out-of-town travel agent arranges their cruise aboard the Father Neptune. Meeting Captain Gramwell of the Father Neptune, the boys learn that one crew member recently left the ship ill and a new hand had been hired. Suspicious, the boys investigate and find the crewman had in fact been kidnapped and the new hand was sent to interrupt the trip. Captain Gramwell reacts quickly and has the new crewman, recognized by the boys as part of the smuggling ring, arrested and questioned to find his missing crewman, who is recovered.  Mr. McClintock, the boys, Biff, and Chet board the Father Neptune in Southport. At sea, the cargo aboard the Father Neptune suddenly shifts, leaving the ship listing badly and in danger of sinking. The crew and passengers rush to redistribute the cargo, eventually restoring the ship upright.  The boys tell Captain Gramwell about the smuggling ring and phantom ship. Captain Gramwell has the ship’s radio operator contact all the ships in the area and discovers that the Lion Tamer spotted just such a ship nearby. Spotting the ship at nightfall, the Father Neptune pursues the mystery ship, identified as the Black Gull, but is unable to overtake it, much to the frustration of Captain Gramwell as the Father Neptune is declared to be the fastest ship in those waters and the mystery ship is obviously older and slower. That night, the mystery ship is again sighted, dark and apparently adrift. Along with the Father Nepture'''s radio operator Sparks, the boys row over to the ship while the Father Neptune keeps a spotlight on the mystery ship to hide the rowboat. This scene is depicted on the cover of the book. Upon boarding the mystery ship, the party finds the ship seemingly abandoned, but are suddenly jumped by the ship’s crew and captured.  Captivity Held captive with Sparks aboard the Black Gull by the chief smuggler Crowfoot, the boys pretend to cast in with the smuggler. Crowfeet tells the boys about the ship’s secret repeller belts around the hull which hold off any motorized vessel or aircraft, allowing the Black Gull (under many different names) to escape from much faster ships and explaining how the boys adrift in the fishing boat were able to get so close with the fishing boat's engine shut down due to fuel exhaustion. After the Black Gull's radio operator falls ill, Crowfeet presses a seemingly reluctant Sparks into service to send messages. The boys then take turns sending coded messages via innocent-sounding nursery rhymes to their father, including the line “sailing, sailing, over the bounding main, for many a sailing ship can go faster…”. Soon a sleek racing sloop under full sail  (immune to the effects of the repeller which only affects motor vessels) approaches and quickly overtakes the slow freighter. Coast Guard officers board and rescue the boys, Sparks, and the captured scientists who had been kidnapped and forced to work for the smuggler. Among them is a chemist who had developed the techniques used to artificially age paper to supply forged documents for sale in the antique / rare document market. The elderly “smuggler” Mitchell turns out to be Mr. McClintock's former business partner and is happily reunited with Mr. McClintock aboard the Father Neptune. With Mitchell rescued, the entire design for the repeller belt is recovered and Mr. McClintock and Mitchell agree to turn the design over to the US Government. The boys, Chet, Biff, and Mr. McClintock then continue their cruise to the Caribbean. The reader is left with a note that the Hardy Boys next mystery will be The Secret of Skull Mountain''.

Secretary of State for Migration,"The Secretary of State for Migration (SEM) is a senior official of the Ministry of Labour, Migrations and Social Security responsible for developing the government's policy on foreigners, immigration and emigration. It also attends and advises the minister in the international meetings about these matters, especially in the European Union meetings.  The SEM is appointed by the Monarch with the advice of the Labour Minister. From the Secretary of State depends a single department, the General Secretariat for Immigration and Emigration, body that in other times has assumed the functions of the secretariat of state.  History Since its inception and its worldwide expansion, Spain has always been a country that has received and sent large amounts of population. Most of the South American population and in a lesser amount the North American population, descends from Spanish ancestry.  That has provoke that a common culture and language link dozens of countries of all the world, not just Latin American countries but also Asian countries like the Philippines, African countries like Morocco or Equatorial Guinea and North American countries like United States and Canada.  It is not clear when migratory issues took center stage within the Spanish administration, although there is evidence that in 1882, a section was created inside the Ministry of Development destinated to these matters. Before this, there are documents that proves that the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of the Navy and the Ministry of Overseas were in charge of overseeing the migrations in the Peninsular Spain and in the Spanish territories in the Americas, Africa, Asia and Oceania and that there were also parliamentary committees to discuss migrations matters.  In the 1920s, the Ministry of Labour assumed the competencies over immigration and emigration that still today maintains. During the dictatorship of Franco, in 1956, it was created the Spanish Institute for Emigration in order to control the emigration of the Spanish population, trying to direct it to countries with cultural links like South American's. This was done through collecting labor information abroad to offer Spaniards more attractive jobs in this type of countries.  In 1985, the Institute was transformed into a Directorate-General being called Directorate-General of the Spanish Institute for Emigration. The name of this directorate was changed in 1991 to Directorate-General for Migration, a more accurate name because since 1985 this directorate had competences not only over emigration, but also over all kind of migrations.  The Directorate-General change its name many times, in 1996 to Directorate-General for Labor and Migration and in 1998 Directorate General for the Regulation of Migrations.  In 2004 was created the current Secretariat of State under the name of Secretariat of State of Immigration and Emigration and depending on it were three directorate-generals: Directorate-General for Immigration, Directorate-General for Emigration and Directorate-General for the Integration of Immigrants. This Secretariat of State was replaced in 2011 by the General Secretariat of Immigration and Emigration and was created again in 2018 by the name of Secretariat of State for Migration and the former General Secretariat of Immigration and Emigration was integrated as a subsidiary department of it.  Structure Under the Secretary of State are the following officials:  The General Secretariat for Immigration and Emigration.  The Directorate-General for Migration.  It is in charge of all administrative affairs regarding immigration and the administrative affairs and public aids to support Spaniards abroad  The Directorate-General for Integration and Humanitarian Attention.

Spoonie Gee,"Gabriel Jackson (born May 27, 1963), better known by his stage name Spoonie Gee, is one of the earliest rap artists, and one of the few to have released rap records in the 1970s. He has been credited with originating the term hip hop and some of the themes in his music were precursors of gangsta rap.  Career  Jackson was born in Harlem, New York City, receiving his 'Spoonie' nickname as a child because the spoon was the only utensil that he used to eat with. His mother died when he was twelve years old, and he went to live with his uncle, the record producer Bobby Robinson, in whose apartment he began to practice rapping.  His first recording came about after Peter Brown visited Robinson's record store and mentioned that he was looking to make a rap record. Spoonie's name was suggested, and he recorded ""Spoonin' Rap"", which was released on Brown's Sound of New York, USA imprint, featuring a lyric that included jailhouse references that would later become common in gangsta rap, and with echo applied to his vocals. Spoonie Gee has been described as ""the original gangsta rapper"".  He then recorded for Robinson's Enjoy! Records; his first release for the label being the similarly minimalistic ""Love Rap"" (on which he was accompanied on congas by his brother Pooche Costello), issued on the B-side of the Treacherous Three's ""New Rap Language"" (on which he also featured), leading to his early nickname of 'The Love Rapper'. Jackson was a founding member of the Treacherous Three, along with L.A. Sunshine and Kool Moe Dee. Although the group added Special K as a member when Jackson left to record his first single, Gee maintained ties and affiliation with the group, and also played a hand in the group getting their first record deal. The group was named Spoonie Gee and the Treacherous Three when Jackson returned for a period before going solo.  He left Enjoy! and moved to Sugar Hill Records, where he enjoyed further hits with ""Spoonie's Back"" and the collaboration with the Sequence on ""Monster Jam"". In 1985, he moved on again to Aaron Fuchs' Tuff City label, on which the majority of his later output was issued, including ""That's My Style"", on which he attacked Schoolly D for copying his style. By the mid-1980s, he was also working in a rehabilitation centre for people with learning disabilities. His career took off once again in 1987 with his debut album The Godfather of Rap, produced by Marley Marl and Teddy Riley, and issued on the Tuff City label. His career has since been hampered by several spells in prison.  In the mid-1990s, a compilation of his work, Godfather of Hip Hop, was issued on the Ol' Skool Flava label. In the mid-2000s, he returned with a new EP, The Boss Is Back.  In 2008, ""Love Rap"" was ranked number 65 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop.

Barbaridactylus,"Barbaridactylus is a nyctosaurid pterosaur from the Ouled Abdoun Basin of Morocco, a basin that dates back to the Maastrichtian stage of the Late Cretaceous. It was published in 2018 by paleontologists Nicholas R. Longrich, David M. Martill, and Brian Andres. In the same publication, two other nyctosaurids from the same basin were described: Alcione and Simurghia. The type and only species is B. grandis.  Discovery and naming  All known specimens of Barbaridactylus were uncovered in a 3-year dig that unearthed about 200 pterosaur specimens. Its type specimen is FSAC-OB 232, which consists of its right femur, left radius, ulna, humerus, and scapulocoracoid, and partial mandible. Four other specimens have been referred to Barbaridactylus, FSAC-OB 8, 9, 10, and 11. They are all humeri.  Barbaridactylus is named after the Barbary Coast of North Africa, and the Greek dactylo, meaning ""finger"". The proper word for ""finger"" in Ancient Greek however, is daktylos (δάκτυλος). Its specific name, grandis means ""great"" in Latin.  Description   Barbaridactylus is a large nyctosaurid, with a humerus length of . Like other nyctosaurids, Barbaridactylus had upward-curving jaws. The only known cervical is also rather typical for nyctosaurids, as it is proportionately short and broad, a morphology also present in the related pteranodontids. The scapulocoracoid is fused, meaning that the animal was probably an adult. It is boomerang shaped, and the two bones (the scapula and coracoid) form a 60 degree angle. The humeral shaft is long and thin. The hatchet-shaped deltopectoral crest (a distinctive feature of nyctosaurids) is in a notably distal location in relation to the humeral head, more similar to that of Nyctosaurus than Alcione. This crest is short and broad, and the expanded tip is weakly developed, which are basal features. The deltopectoral crest appears warped from an anterior view, more so than in other nyctosaurids, but much less than in pteranodontids. There is a pneumatic fossa located on the ventral surface of each humeral head that is unique to this species. The ulna is relatively gracile, unlike the robust ulna of Alcione, and its ends are weakly expanded. The diameter radius is approximately two thirds that of the ulna. The femur of Barbaridactylus is relatively typical for a nyctosaurid, although it lacks the strong distal expansion present in other nyctosaurids. Instead, it expands more gently, similar to that of Pteranodon.  Classification Below is a cladogram showing the results of a phylogenetic analysis first presented by Andres and colleagues in 2014, and updated with additional data by Longrich and colleagues in 2018. In this analysis, they found Barbaridactylus to be the sister taxon of the Nyctosaurus species N. lamegoi, both placed within the family Nyctosauridae.  Paleoecology   Barbaridactylus was discovered in upper Maastrichtian phosphates located in the Ouled Abdoun Basin of Northern Morocco. This geological formation does not belong to a formation. It is divided into couches, with Barbaridactylus being discovered in Couche III. This layer dates back to the latest Maastrichtian, about 1 million years before the extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous. Couche III represents the most diverse marine ecosystem known from the time.  A large variety of marine life is known from the region, including sharks and bony fish, in addition to turtles, plesiosaurs and mosasaurs. A few rare, fragmentary dinosaur fossils are known, including an abelisaur and a sauropod. Other pterosaurs in the formation were originally only represented by the azhdarchid Phosphatodraco mauritanicus. However, in addition to Barbaridactylus, more recent studies have revealed at least five more pterosaur species from this location, including Alcione, Simurghia and Tethydraco.

Nan Hardie,"Agnes ""Nan"" Paterson Hardie (5 October 1885 – 27 June 1947) was a Scottish labour movement activist.  Life Hardie was born in Cumnock in Ayrshire, Hardie was the daughter of Keir and Lilian Hardie.  Hardie was then a prominent mining trade unionist, and he later became the first leader of the Labour Party.  Keir believed that Nan would be his political heir, and spent a large amount of time discussing politics with her, and introduced her to other leading figures in the movement; notably, John Bruce Glasier, with whom she retained a long-term friendship.  Nan left school at the age of fourteen but, three years later, became seriously ill, suffering from pleurisy and appendicitis; although she recovered, she suffered with poor health for the remainder of her life.  She accompanied her father on many speaking trips, including one to Nova Scotia in 1912, until 1915 when he became ill; Nan and her mother looked after him until he died, later in the year.  In 1924, Hardie married Emrys Hughes, a socialist journalist, and she spent much of the next decade assisting him in his journalistic and political career.  In 1933, she herself was elected to Cumnock Town Council, on which she served as convenor of the Public Health Committee.  In 1935, she succeeded her husband as provost, and the two together waged a long campaign for slum clearance and their replacement with council housing.  This was massively successful, and by 1939, three-quarters of the town's population lived in council houses.  Hardie took a particular interest in children's activities, founding a park and lido in the town, and also promoted cycling.  She was appointed as a magistrate, and during World War II chaired the Cumnock War Work Party; although, like her husband, she opposed the conflict, she was keen to assist in the welfare of those serving in the force and their dependents.  In 1946, Hughes became seriously ill, and Hardie tried to resign as provost.  Instead, the council persuaded her to take a leave of absence, but the process of caring for him damaged her own health, and she died in June 1947.

Cor Boonstra,"Cor Boonstra (Leeuwarden, 7 January 1938) is mainly known as president of the Board of Directors of Philips (1996–2001).  Biography   At the age of 16, he quit his study at the Hogere burgerschool and started to work for Unilever. In 1974 he started to work for Sara Lee, where he ultimately became the president of the board of directors.  On 31 December 1993 he withdrew from Sara Lee. In the beginning of 1994 he was asked by former Philips top executive Jan Timmer to participate in the Board of Directors of Philips, to breathe new life to the brand Philips. Boonstra was responsible for the 'Let's make things better'- campaign.  Two years after his commencement of employment with Philips, Boonstra became the successor of Timmer as the president of the board of directors. He held this leading position until 2001. While Boonstra was in charge, the market-value of Philips increased fivefold mainly by focusing on short-term profits and selling off company units like BSO/Origin (now a part of Atos and record company PolyGram. During his leadership he moved the head office (the top 350 employees) of Philips from Eindhoven to Amsterdam, the capital of the country. Since most of the regular staff remained in Eindhoven, the birthplace of the company, this move was not popular among Philips employees. In 2000 Boonstra was chosen 'top executive of the year'. Boonstra divorced two times, and has two children (Cor Boonstra and Roelof Boonstra) of his first wife.  In 1998 Boonstra and his first wife barely survived a hijacking. At that time Boonstra already was having an affair with Sylvia Tóth. A few years later, Boonstra was accused of insider trading in which he allegedly earned several hundreds of thousands of euros by trading in Endemol shares (where Sylvia Tóth was a member of the board) just before that company was acquired by the Spanish Telefónica. Boonstra was ultimately acquitted in court as no hard evidence existed that his partner Tóth had shared the information on the impending deal with him. The Dutch press referred to the inside deal as the ""pillow talk deal"".  A few months later Cor Boonstra was again charged for not reporting trading in Ahold shares where he himself was a member of the board. He was found guilty and charged a 135.000 euro fine.

Juniperus chinensis,"Juniperus chinensis, the Chinese juniper (圆柏, 桧) is a species of plant in the cypress family Cupressaceae, native to China, Myanmar, Japan, Korea and the Russian Far East. Growing  tall, it is a very variable coniferous evergreen tree or shrub,  Growth The leaves grow in two forms, juvenile needle-like leaves 5–10 mm long, and adult scale-leaves 1.5–3 mm long. Mature trees usually continue to bear some juvenile foliage as well as adult, particularly on shaded shoots low in the crown. This species is often dioecious (either male or female plants), but some individual plants produce both sexes of flowers. The blue-black berry-like cones grow to 7–12 mm in diameter, have a whitish waxy bloom, and contain 2–4 seeds; they mature in about 18 months. The male cones, 2–4 mm long, shed their pollen in early spring.  Cultivation and uses This popular ornamental tree or shrub for gardens, parks, and in tough coastal conditions of hot sun and sandy fast-draining soils, has more than 100 named cultivars selected for various characteristics, such as yellow foliage (e.g. cvs. 'Aurea', 'Tremonia'), permanently juvenile foliage (e.g. cv. 'Shoosmith'), columnar crown shape (cv. 'Columnaris'), abundant cones (e.g. cv. 'Kaizuka'), etc. First popular in the United States in the Los Angeles gardens in Mediterranean style homes, and now commonly found along both the West and East Coast in beach and coastal areas.  The Chinese juniper is widely used in bonsai, both as individual plants, such as the 250-year-old ""Omiya tree"" in the Birmingham Botanical Gardens in the UK, and in groups, such as the well-known Goshin on display at the National Bonsai and Penjing Museum at the US National Arboretum.

Nero Forte,"""Nero Forte"" is a song by American heavy metal band Slipknot. Produced by Greg Fidelman, it was released as the fourth single from the band's sixth studio album We Are Not Your Kind on December 16, 2019.  Background   ""Nero Forte"" was released on December 16, 2019 as the band's fourth single off their sixth studio album We Are Not Your Kind, following after the release of ""Birth of the Cruel"" four months previously. The song's title ""Nero"" and ""Forte"" are Italian words that mean ""black"" and ""strong"" respectively. ""Forte"" can also mean something in which you excel.  Recording and meaning   Though the song title does not appear in the lyrics, it describes the darkness that Taylor sunk into. The depression was like an entity that he did not feel he had the strength to fight against. When talking about the song, guitarist Jim Root stated: ""This is also a Clown song, which is amazing. This one is going to be great live. It's very percussive and reminiscent of ""Psychosocial"", but maybe an evolution of ""Psychosocial"". Obviously, Clown is a drummer and percussionist, but he's also a songwriter—and he always has been. Now we're able to collaborate as songwriters, and this is what we end up with. When Corey came in and started diving into the vocals, he came up with this extra melody in the chorus line, very late into the process. That really drew me into this song.""  Music video   Shawn Crahan, Slipknot's percussionist and founder, directed the video along with a 20 minute short film titled Pollution, which would be released on the same day as the ""Nero Forte"". They were both recorded within two days, on both the 29th and 30 October. They were both initially to be released at some point during November, but for some reasons they did not come into fruition until a later date.  The ""Nero Forte"" music video stars the band, who jam out and perform in a white limbo, constantly flashed by coloured beaming lights, at points surrounding what seems to be a fan inside of a cocoon, which has something inside which appears to try to be trying to escape and be reborn.  As of December 2021, the song has 40 million views on YouTube.

School uniforms in South Korea,"Almost all South Korean secondary students wear a prescribed school uniform, gyobok (). The majority of elementary schools except some private elementary schools do not have uniforms; however, the uniform is strictly enforced from the start of middle school and up. A typical South Korean uniform usually consists of a shirt, blazer and tie, with skirts for girls and trousers for boys. More recently, the uniform is often worn by celebrities who target the younger, teen audience to sell entertainment products. The school uniform and school setting is frequently used as a venue for romance. As a result, the uniform has become something akin to an expression of fashion among students.  History The Encyclopedia of Korean Culture divides the history of school uniforms into six parts: the 1800s-1910, 1910–1945, 1945–1968, 1968–1982, 1982–1985, 1986-current. While the first instances of school uniforms were shown in schools established in the late Goryeo period, a general influence is attributed to Confucius students from the Joseon period.  Late 19th and early 20th century  The first school uniform in South Korea is from the Ewha Girl's University, now known as Ewha Womans University. The uniform was designated in 1886. The uniform consisted of a red jeogori and skirt made of cotton. The hair was braided swept-back with a knot. Clothing designed as a veil was used as an outdoor uniform. A heavier version of the clothing was used during the winter. Since the tradition was to wear different colored uniforms, the same red-colored uniform became a matter of curiosity.  The first boys' school uniform in South Korea originates from the boys' school Paichai Hakdang established by Henry Appenzeller. The uniform was created in 1898. The uniform heavily resembled the Japanese school uniform, consisting of red color bands wrapped around the sleeves, pants, and hat. Some scholars argue that the tradition of Korean school uniforms began with this uniform. Hansung Middle School, which was established in 1904, used a black durumagi with a black belt and a hat with the words 'Hansung' for a uniform.  In 1907, the first 'Yangjang' uniform was created in the Sookmyung Women's University. The uniform consisted of a purple serge one-piece clothing with a pink bonnet and heels. The uniform had a strong impact on Korean culture.  20th century  After the Japan-Korea Treaty of 1910, the school uniforms were widely implemented. This movement was heavily influenced by Western missionaries and was centered around girls-only schools. In general, Jeogori was elongated while the skirt was shortened. The previously diverse colors in school uniforms became less and less diverse, with most uniforms becoming shades of black and white.  In the 1920s, most of the girl uniforms came to have the 'white top black bottom' policy. However, schools differentiated their uniforms from others by means such as wave patterns and skirt lengths. Because the skirts were getting shorter, schools implemented an official policy concerning the length of the skirt. However, the skirt lengths kept decreasing. Also in the 1920s, P.E. uniforms were introduced. There were many types of P.E. uniforms, but it mostly consisted of a shirt and bloomers.  In the 1930s, the Empire of Japan, which ruled over Korea, implemented a policy to unify the girls' uniforms as 'yangjang.' The change in policy is attributed to both a growing awareness of Western culture and a movement by Japan to get rid of hanbok. The most widespread school uniform for girls was a white blouse with a brown skirt, and a sailor suit uniform in the winter. However, a few schools still maintained the hanbok uniform.  In the late 1930s to the 1940s, students were forced to wear workwear. This was due to the beginning of World War II and Japan's involvement in the war. The uniform was dubbed 'Mum-Bae (몸빼).' Some schools avoided this policy by designating other pants as uniforms. Other schools such as ChungShim Women's School refused to comply with the policy and wore hanbok.  With the completion of the Korean independence movement and the independence of Korea, the workwear uniform was discarded. Until the 1960s, uniform pants were still worn as the official uniform. The uniforms were generally black or dark brown.  In 1968, the government established the 'Middle School Equalization Policy.' The Middle School uniforms were standardized at this time. The summer uniform was established as a white 'Wing-collar' blouse and the winter uniform as black or dark brown clothing. This policy was maintained until 1982.  From 1983 to 1985, school uniforms were briefly abolished due to a 'free school uniform policy.' The policy was established to diminish the senses of oppression and alienation while encouraging individualism. This policy was removed in 1986 when schools were allowed to mandate uniforms again. Since then, the number of schools mandating uniforms had been increasing.  Current  Schools are currently not compelled to institute school uniforms. However, according to the Ministry of Education (South Korea), 96.4% of female students are wearing uniforms. To combat temperature, sexual harassment, and traditional sexual discrimination, the Ministry of Education (South Korea) has been encouraging the usage of pants as school uniforms, as of 2000.  Components A typical Korean school uniform for a boy usually includes a jacket, a long-sleeved collared white shirt, a tie, dress trousers, and outerwear for the Winter season. A girl's Korean school uniform generally consists of a bow, a collared white shirt with sleeves, a vest, a pleated skirt and outerwear for the winter, and white socks. Nail polish and make-up were generally not allowed until many municipal education departments enacted 'Student's rights acts' which include freedom of uniform and freedom of hair style.

"3rd Battalion, 9th Marines","The 3rd Battalion, 9th Marines (3/9) is an infantry battalion of the United States Marine Corps.  Formed during World War I it served until the early 1990s when it was redesignated as 3rd Battalion, 4th Marines (3/4) during a realignment and renumbering of the Marine Corps' infantry battalions, following the deactivation of the 9th Marine Regiment.  The 3rd Battalion, 9th Marines was initially a subordinate unit of the 9th Marine Regiment, 3rd Marine Division, but was later operationally transferred to the 1st Marine Division as a subordinate unit of the 7th Marine Regiment where it remained until its redesignation as 3/4.  3/9 was reactivated under the 2nd Marine Division in May 2008 as the Marines expanded as a result of the continuing War on Terror.

In September 1942, the battalion was relocated to Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton and reassigned to the 3rd Marine Division.  The battalion was initially deployed to Cape Paerata, New Zealand in February 1943 and then moved to Guadalcanal in July of that year.  3/9 participated in the following campaigns during World War Two: Bougainville, Northern Solomons, Guam, and Iwo Jima. At Iwo Jima, 3/9 had the distinction of making the only battalion size unsupported, non-illuminated night attack against the Japanese in the Pacific War. Attesting to the ferocity of combat on Iwo Jima, all 22 of the battalion's officers who landed on D-Day were killed or wounded by the end of the battle. For their service at Iwo Jima, the battalion received the Presidential Unit Citation. The battalion was disbanded on 31 October 1945.

Ashburn Alley,"Ashburn Alley is the open concourse behind center field at Citizens Bank Park, home of the Philadelphia Phillies. It is named after Hall of Famer Richie Ashburn, Phillies center fielder from 1948 to 1959, and was also a long time broadcaster for the Phillies from 1963 until his death in September 1997. Ashburn Alley spans from the left field gate to ""The Yard"" kids area, and features a ""street-fair"" like atmosphere before and during a game.  Ashburn Alley's name sake began while Ashburn was still playing. During the Phillies playing days at old Shibe Park, Ashburn was known for dropping bunts down the third baseline, which had slightly overgrown grass that helped the ball stay fair. A bronze statue of Ashburn lies in the center of the alley.  Features  Ashburn Alley serves as a history lesson of baseball in Philadelphia. Granite markers on the walk-way feature every Phillies all-star since the first game in 1933. Another feature of Ashburn Alley is Memory Lane. Memory Lane is located directly behind the batter's eye, and gives an extensive look at the history of Philadelphia baseball. It features the history of the Phillies, the history of Philadelphia Athletics, and history of Negro league teams in the city. At the end of the Memory Lane section offers a great view of the stadiums' two tiered bullpen. The upper bullpen, in particular, pulls snug against the concourse.  On the western end of the Alley is Bull's BBQ, named after former Phillies slugger Greg ""The Bull"" Luzinski, who also operates it. Bull's BBQ is an outdoor picnic section and serves barbecue pork sandwiches, chicken, and most notably ribs. Luzinski is at most of the games and often socializes with fans.  On top of the concession buildings in the center of the Alley is the Rooftop Bleachers. This area of the stadium was influenced by the old rooftop seats at the Phillies and Athletics old home Shibe Park. It was common during the 1920s for residents who lived in the rowhouses across from the ballpark to watch the games for free on their rooftops.  There are many concession stands featuring Philadelphia cuisine staples such as the cheesesteak, at both Tony Luke's and Campo's. The Alley also features the '47 Brand store, which sells classic Phillies apparel, classic pennants and banners, and other items.

Midget car racing,"Midget cars, also speedcars in Australia, is a class of racing cars. The cars are very small with a very high power-to-weight ratio and typically use four cylinder engines. They originated in the United States in the 1930s and are raced on most continents. There is a worldwide tour and national midget tours in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand.  Cars  Typically, these four cylinder engine cars have  to  and weigh . The high power and small size of the cars combine to make midget racing quite dangerous; for this reason, modern midget cars are fully equipped with roll cages and other safety features. Some early major midget car manufacturers include Kurtis Kraft (1930s to 1950s) and Solar (1944–46). Midgets are intended to be driven for races of relatively short distances, usually 2.5 to 25 miles (4 to 40 km). Some events are staged inside arenas, like the Chili Bowl held in early January at the Tulsa Expo Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma. There are midget races in dirt track racing and in asphalt (paved tracks).  There are three-quarter (TQ) midgets which developed from ""midget midget"" cars of the late 1940s. Quarter midgets are the one quarter the size of a full midget car.  History   The first organized Midget car race happened on June 4, 1933. The sports' first regular weekly program began on August 10, 1933 at the Loyola High School Stadium in Los Angeles under the control of the first official governing body, the Midget Auto Racing Association (MARA). After spreading across the country, the sport traveled around the world; first to Australia in 1934 at Melbourne's Olympic Park on December 15, and to New Zealand in 1937. Early midget races were held on board tracks previously used for bicycle racing. When the purpose built speedway at Gilmore Stadium was completed, racing ended at the school stadium, and hundreds of tracks began to spring up across the United States. Angell Park Speedway in Sun Prairie, Wisconsin (near Madison) is another major track in the United States operating since the first half of the twentieth century.  The AAA Contest Board soon started sanctioning midget races across the country, facing opposition from independent drivers and racetracks. After the AAA withdrew from sanctioning races in 1955, the United States Auto Club took over as the major sanctioning body of midget car racing in the United States. NASCAR had a midget division from 1952 to 1968.  Soon after in Australia, speedcar racing became popular with the first Australian Speedcar Championship being contested in Melbourne in 1935, its popularity running through the country's ""golden era"" of the 1950s and 1960s. Australian promoters such as Adelaide's Kym Bonython who ran the Rowley Park Speedway, and Empire Speedways who ran the Brisbane Exhibition Ground and the famous Sydney Showground Speedway, often imported drivers from the US, such as the popular Jimmy Davies. Promoters in Australia during this period often staged races billed as either a ""world speedcar championship"" or ""world speedcar derby"". During this time speedcars were arguably the most popular category in Australian speedway with crowds of up to 30,000 attending meetings at the Sydney Showground and over 10,000 in Adelaide and Brisbane.  Speedcars continue to race in Australia, with the major events being the Australian Championship, and the Australian Speedcar Grand Prix (first run in 1938). Along with various state championships, there is also the Speedcar Super Series which travels throughout Australia. Speedcar crowds of 10,000 people are common in Australia for these major events.  In December 2013, POWRi Midget Racing began a 16-event Lucas Oil POWRi Midget World Championship that ran until June 2014. Drivers competed in New Zealand and Australia at the beginning of the 2013–14 season and ended in the United States.  Midget car racing also grew in popularity in the Northeast of the United States, in part due to racers like Bill Schindler and events at tracks like that at Hinchcliffe Stadium.  Stepping stone to high profile divisions  Many IndyCar and NASCAR drivers used midget car racing as an intermediate stepping stone on their way to more high-profile divisions, including Tony Stewart, Sarah Fisher, Jeff Gordon, A. J. Foyt, Mario Andretti, Kasey Kahne, Ryan Newman, Kyle Larson , Art Pollard  and others. The events are sometimes held on weeknights so that popular and famous drivers from other, higher-profiled types of motor racing (who race in those higher-profiled types of racing on the weekends) will be available to compete, and so that it does not conflict with drivers' home tracks.  Notable midget car races  In 1959 Lime Rock Park held a famous Formula Libre race, where Rodger Ward shocked the expensive and exotic sports cars by beating them on the road course in an Offenhauser powered midget car, usually used on oval tracks. Ward used an advantageous power-to-weight ratio and dirt-track cornering abilities to steal the win.

Midgets are generally powered by small engines ranging from 125cc (6 cu in) up through 750 cc (36 cu in). The most common engine size today is 250cc (12 cu in), which produces about 20 horsepower at 7500 rpm; however, some larger tracks allow use of 350cc or 500cc engines as well.  Midgets have no roof but do feature roll bars that protect drivers' heads when they crash into each other on high-speed turns.   Most modern-day midgets weigh between 450–550 lb (204–240 kg).   There were two major series of USAC National Championship Midget Car races held annually until 2009 – one east of the Mississippi River called East Series events, and another west of it known as West Series events.

"Henry Hylton, de jure 12th Baron Hylton","Henry Hylton, de jure 12th Baron Hylton (1586 – 30 March 1641) was an English nobleman.  Hylton was the eldest son of Thomas Hylton (himself the son of William Hylton, de jure 11th Baron Hylton) and his wife, Anne née Bowes (daughter of Sir George Bowes of Streatlam Castle). In 1600, Hylton inherited the right to the barony of Hylton from his grandfather.

He married Mary Stanley, daughter of Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby.   His wife died without issue after only two years; she had been pregnant at her death but miscarried shortly before giving birth to twins who were stillborn.    In 1663, Henry remarried Anne Smythe, widow of John Cope, 2nd Viscount St Alban's, whose mother was also named Anne Smythe.     They had no children together either, although they did have one child from another relationship which Henry adopted into his family lineage.      After his second marriage failed too,  Henry became involved in a series of affairs including those with Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, and Catherine Maria Fisher, sister-in-law of Samuel Pepys.       The barony passed through several hands until it finally came back to him in 1673 when he inherited it again upon the death of his nephew William Hylton, 13th Lord Hylton.

Alpha Rho Upsilon,"Alpha Rho Upsilon ( in Greek, ARU in Latin/English; pronounced A-roo) was a fraternity at Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, from 1946 until it was disbanded in 1990. Until then it occupied a late Victorian wood-frame house at 238 Maine Street.  Founding and history An offshoot of the Thorndike Club, a dining club formed in 1937 for non-fraternity students at the college, ARU was founded in 1946 by a group of Bowdoin students, who included World War II veterans, in reaction to the exclusion of Jewish and African American students from the other campus fraternities at the time. The letters ARU stood for ""All Races United,"" and they lived up to their name by, for example, sponsoring a Japanese student in 1951. History Professor Ernst Christian Helmreich was the faculty adviser to the Thorndike Club from 1937–1946. German Professor Fritz Carl August Koelln was the fraternity's long-time faculty adviser. Recognizing the discriminatory practices of the fraternity system of that era against African American and Jewish students, Professors Helmreich and Koelln played significant roles in the formation of ARU as a fraternity that welcomed students of all religions and ethnic backgrounds into its fellowship. That the Thorndike Club and, hence, ARU came into existence is a testament to the sadness of the family of man divided on the basis of skin color, ethnicity or religious belief. The meaning of ARU was never lost by its Brothers.  ARU initially resided in Moore Hall, one of Bowdoin's dormitories, then moved to a former faculty housing hall at 264 Maine Street before purchasing their 238 Maine Street home from the Sigma Nu fraternity.  An architectural hybrid of Colonial Revival and the Shingle Style featuring Palladian windows, gambrels, peaked dormers and a balconied front porch with Ionic columns, the ARU house was built between 1894 and 1900 as the residence of George Taylor and Edith Davis Files. An 1889 Bowdoin graduate, George Files was a German professor at the college until his death in 1919 upon returning from France, where he had helped the YMCA with the war effort. In 1921, Mrs. Files endowed the George Taylor Files Professorship in Modern Languages at Bowdoin and sold their house to Sigma Nu, who in turn sold it to ARU in 1951 upon relocating to the college's present Hartley Cone Baxter House.  The ""new wing"" was added in the rear in 196? [NEED DATE] with six double rooms and two bathrooms.  The other college-sanctioned fraternities at Bowdoin were local chapters of national fraternities that opposed admission of ""minorities"" and women to their ranks.  Bowdoin first admitted women as freshmen in 1971, but admitted women as exchange students, and then transfers, starting in 196? NEED DATE. ARU voted to become co-ed immediately when women were first female exchange students were accepted, and many joined ARU.  Bowdoin's first woman graduate, transfer Susan Jacobs '70, is an ARU.  Governance The ARU Executive Board, elected by popular vote of the fraternity members, comprised a President, Vice President, Treasurer, Social Chairman, Recording Secretary, Corresponding Secretary, Steward, Freshman Orientation Chairman, Guest Night Chairman and Historian. In honor of the fraternity's World War II veteran origins, coinciding with the ""Flyers"" nickname (see below), the Executive Board was informally called the Strategic Air Command, and its first six positions were nicknamed Pilot, Co-pilot, Navigator, Tailgunner, Log Keeper and Radioman, respectively. Each elected official gave his/her own report at the fraternity's weekly house meetings. For a period in the early 1970s into the mid-1980s there was an ad hoc ""Joint Chiefs"" committee.  Activities and traditions Annual ARU activities and traditions included:  Work Week, the week prior to the start of a new school year, when fraternity members arrived early to clean and prep the house for Rush Week.  Rush Week, the week before college classes began, when all fraternities sought new members from the incoming freshman class by holding open-invitation parties at their houses. Selected freshmen were invited to join a fraternity by receiving ""bids"" from its underclassmen, by consent of the entire membership.  Drop Night, when fraternities held dress-up banquets to welcome new members, who would join by showing up at the fraternity they had chosen.  Hell Night, ARU's new-member initiation, which included a comically spooky ritual in which each new member was asked questions about why they joined ARU, what they planned to contribute to it, etc.  Sacrifice of the Virgin Pumpkin, a purification ceremony that non-believers may have viewed as a Halloween costume parade around campus.  At the high point of the event, a senior class member designated as ""High Priest"", chosen by his predecessor, ritually sacrificed the Virgin Pumpkin - one not tainted by commercialism and procured illicitly - by casting it from ARU's front, second story balcony onto the granite carriage step (removed during street reconstruction) next to the Maine Street curb, smashing the Pumpkin into pieces. A sherry reception (Harvey's Bristol Cream) followed. The rite started in reaction to a notorious event that occurred in the House in the mid-1960s that almost caused the House to be closed.  The Sacrifice warded off the evils that almost destroyed the House. In 1971, a brother composed a processional hymn for the Sacrifice to the tune of an old Yiddish song: ""Holy and pure virgin pumpkin, solemn we follow thee / Holy and pure virgin pumpkin, solemn we follow thee / Fertile, undefiled, regal in satin clad / Blessed vegetable in the ninth year of the bag.""  (The ""ninth year of the bag"" would indicate that the Sacrifice dated back to 1962; presumably, the hymn composer had done some research.)  The emphasis of the Sacrifice ceremony was on purity.  The High Priest, in particular, needed exceptional pureness.  English majors were preferred, although majors in other pure subjects, such as Classics, Religion, and Math, were looked on favorably.  The High Priest would consult with other seniors before selecting his successor from the junior class.  The other celebrants, also selected carefully, were the Pumpkin Bearer, who carried the Blessed Vegetable on a silk pillow, and two Guards who ritualistically defended the entire procession and ceremony from the insults and attacks of the Devil's Advocate.  All ARU's were expected to participate in the ceremony by first getting as purified as possible at the house.  At about 1130 pm the High Priest and his entourage would don their mystical vestments.  All the other Ru's would at least throw a sheet over their shoulders.  The procession crossed Maine Street and went to the Chapel steps for the Consecration of the Virgin.  The priest then led the devoted to the Walker steps where he delivered an Oratory.  The procession then returned to Chapel Walk and crossed to block Maine Street while the High Priest, Pumpkin Bearer, and Guards ascended to the balcony over the front porch.  Raising the Blessed Vegetable over his head, the High Priest would shout something profound (Chris Gahran in '73: ""Cancel my rumba lessons!"") as he threw the Chaste Gourd to the ground to the acclaim of the faithful, now assured that ARU was protected from untoward events for another year.  Light refreshments and further purification followed.  The Art Exhibit, where members showed off their creations. A team of judges picked a winner.  The Butterman, the annual mysterious appearance of a pat of butter on a structural component of the dining hall (a ceiling beam, etc.) with no fraternal knowledge of who put it there.  Beethoven's Birthday, an interfaith winter holiday party for members and invited guests, which included a ""Secret Santa"" gift exchange. The event originally started as a celebration of the founding of the House, which occurred close to Beethoven's Birthday.  Beethoven's evolved into a ""formal"" party.  The Ru's dressed up and Beethoven symphonies played on the downstairs sound system.  The faculty were cordially invited to a good dinner and to partake of an open bar.  ARU's bar was acknowledged as the best on campus, and many faculty attended.  President Howell was a regular.  This event served the dual purpose of a chance to blow off steam before first-semester finals while simultaneously brown-nosing the faculty.  Mr. ARU, a talent contest where selected contestants presented comic acts, song-and-dance acts, etc., vying for the ""Mr. ARU"" and ""Mr. Congeniality"" prizes.  The Prom, a dance for members and their in-house or guest dates.  Shot-A-Minute, a drinking contest to see who could down the most shots of beer without vomiting, running to the bathroom, etc. Each contestant drank one shot-glass full of beer per minute until s/he could hold no more.  These contests were held in the dining room.  The equitable and humanitarian ""one go, no blow"" rule was added to allow a contestant to use the ""new wing"" john to relieve him/herself, once, so long as s/he constantly blew a whistle from the house Risk game.  This assured that the ""no blow"" part of the rule was observed.  The St. Patty's Day Drinkoff, a celebration of St. Patrick's Day (March 17) in the form of a drinking contest or free-for-all boozefest.   Les Biens, This was the name of ARU's intra-fraternity teams in the early 1970s. It was meant as a parody of Les Owls from the Psi Upsilon (Psi U) fraternity down the street.  Of course, it merely looked like it would translate from French to ""The Goods.""  The Green Hornet Construction Company, on-campus construction project on May 4 akin to MIT's ""hacking"" tradition. It evolved from something spontaneous to a more formal project to commemorate some key event on campus at the time. The first project in 1965 was the construction of a temple using smudge pot lanterns and the granite curb stones to be placed along Twelve Rod Road now named Park Row. As it evolved, the projects were sometimes pre-assembled in the confines of the fraternity house. In the dead of night and as silently as possible, construction took place on the Quad. At completion, the Company retreated to the fraternity house ""buzzing"" in unison. Then, with the aid of liquid refreshment, the Bill was written for submission to the Dean of the College. By agreement with the Dean circa 1969, the project could stand for one day and was disassembled by the Company during the next night. Some of the projects were:-1970, The Lake Bowdoin Recreation Facility was constructed to take advantage of the spring flooding of the quad, -1971, Piippo Hall, The first newly constructed women's dormitory named after Mrs. Piippo, the ubiquitous administrative secretary. -1973, Will Hughes Pre-Med Memorial Cemetery, to commemorate the failure of many promising freshmen in an intro science class.  The ""Green Hornet Society"" at contemporary Bowdoin continues the Green Hornet Construction Company's tradition albeit with costumed revelers and in the light of day.  Various campus-wide parties and coffeehouses, some in conjunction with Bowdoin's annual Parents' Day, Winter's Weekend and Ivies Weekend celebrations. Parents' Weekend in particular was another occasion when the quality of ARU's bar impressed guests.  The Hurtdance Corporation Presents, a weekly or biweekly typed recap of unusually funny or off-the-wall events, happenings, actions or quotes members said or did in the house over that one or two weeks. A ""hurtdance"" is an ultimate all-nighter in which a student attempts to complete an unusually large amount of procrastinated schoolwork in one night. The initial letters of The Hurtdance Corporation were THC, an ingredient in marijuana.  Ralph Adolph (or Adolf), the fictitious ARU Brother whose home address was 727&1/2(?) Boylston Street, Boston.  Ralph received magazines to which the fraternity subscribed.  He also became the President of the Green Hornet Construction Company.  Charles Paisley, another fictitious ARU Brother, named for a character in Monty Python's ""The Piranha Brothers"" sketch, whom a non-member posed as on the fraternity's 1979 composite picture. At many special dinners such as Beethoven's Birthday and Winter's Weekend, ""a toast to Charles Paisley"" was proposed.  ARU Flyers, a derogatory nickname embraced by ARUs in the late 60's-early 70's. A flyer was defined by one brother of the era as ""one whose feet are firmly planted in mid-air.""  The ARU Runway, annually the tarmacked walkway across the park separating Twelve Rod Road from Maine Street that led to ARU was painted for the ARU Flyers landing benefit as they returned to the fraternity house.  Defenestration, the act of tossing a fraternity member out of a first-floor window for unbecoming conduct of one kind or another.   Sock-a-Nuck's Heroes of the Week, in the early 1970s, two fraternity brothers recognized people (or things) who demonstrated valor (or not).  This evolved into a weekly Heroes List, posted every Monday by the semi-secret Heroes List Editor, naming the ten most Heroic ARU's of the previous week or weekend accompanied by the editor's summary of the outstanding exploits of each Hero.  Editorial discernment was important.  Legends were born, especially when hither-to unnoticed freshmen vaulted into stardom.   Senior Night, an end-of-the-year banquet where the graduating members received roasts from underclassmen and gave farewell speeches. Awards presented at the banquet included: Freshman of the Year, determined by the Executive Board; Outstanding Junior, chosen by the senior class; the Kitchen Help Award, given by the Steward; the Trashmouth Award, for creativity in the use of expletives; and the Log Keeper's award, for the member mentioned the most often (some years, the least often) in Log Keeper's reports at house meetings.  ""Freshmen Raid"" and ""Freshman Prank"" were designed to inculcate brotherhood among the incoming class.  The Raid required the frosh to plan a secret, middle-of-night attack to take control of the House, waking up upper-classmen by tying them in their beds or locking them in their rooms or such.  The Prank involved a trick played elsewhere on campus, and ideally would add to the reputation for zaniness that ARU enjoyed.  Stealing TD's front door and stealing all the toilet seats at the Zate house were examples.  Both houses got back their missing items, and ARU's reputation for crazy stunts was polished.  ARU also established a college-wide award, the James Bowdoin Cup, given annually to a distinguished scholar-athlete at the school.  Dissolution Arrears with the college forced ARU's closing in 1990, which initiated the conversion of all of Bowdoin's fraternities into a system of college-owned social houses, in which entering students are assigned a ""college house"" affiliation correlating with their first-year dormitory. Each house was thus renamed after a distinguished alumnus of said fraternity. The ARU fraternity house was renamed Helmreich House after Bowdoin history and political-science professor Ernst Christian Helmreich, the faculty adviser to the Thorndike Club. His grandsons, James '81 and Alan '83, were also members.  Distinguished alumni Other distinguished ARU alumni include author & reporter Gordon Weil '54, Judge Berle M. Schiller '65, Congressman Tom Andrews '75, noted economist Larry Lindsey '76, opera singer Kurt Ollmann '77, and science fiction writer Walter H. Hunt '81.

Seshemnefer (III),"Seshemnefer (also labelled Seshemnefer III) was an ancient Egyptian official of the Fifth Dynasty, most likely under king Djedkare Isesi. At the end of his career he became vizier, the highest office in Ancient Egypt, second only to the king.  Seshemnefer was born into an influential family. His father was also called Seshemnefer, his mother Henutsen. The father was overseer of the scribes of the king's document and overseer of all royal works. Seshemnefer III is mainly known from his mastaba (tomb) at Giza (G5170), which was excavated under the direction of Wilhelm Sieglin. The chapel of the mastaba is now in the museum of the University of Tübingen.   Seshemnefer's wife, Hetepheres, was priestess of Neith, but also king's daughter of his body. He had four sons, three of whom were also called Seshemnefer; the fourth was called Neferseshemptah. One of these sons, Seshemnefer (IV), was buried at Dahshur and had mastaba there.   In the chapel of his mastaba, Seshemnefer appears most often as overseer of the scribes of the king's document. At the end of his career he became vizier and overseer of all royal works. He also received the title king's son of his body, albeit evidently not being the son of a king.   The precise dating of Seshemnefer can be concluded only by architectural observations, as no king's name is preserved in his tomb.

History  XEZT-AM 1250 received its concession on November 26, 1970. It was owned by Juan Bautista Ponce de León Terán and sold to the current concessionaire in 1976.  On July 14, 2017, the Federal Telecommunications Institute (IFT) approved the migration of XEZT to FM as XHZT-FM 95.5, but the station did not pay the fee to migrate. The frequency was then awarded to XEHIT-AM to migrate as XHHIT-FM, which signed on in November 2018.  Until 2018, XEZT carried the La Mejor grupera format from MVS Radio. The station left the network in September 2018 but returned to grupera under the ""La Magnífica"" name in October 2019.  It later emerged that an error by the IFT led to Tribuna Comunicación underpaying the required fee to migrate, an error also made with respect to the migration of XEEG-AM 1280. Tribuna sued the IFT in court and successfully won an order to have 95.5 made available for its use. In 2020, XHHIT-FM was moved to 105.5 MHz in compliance with the court order; on November 24, 2021, La Magnífica then launched on FM.

Polyhedral map projection,"A polyhedral map projection is a map projection based on a spherical polyhedron. Typically, the polyhedron is overlaid on the globe, and each face of the polyhedron is transformed to a polygon or other shape in the plane. The best-known polyhedral map projection is Buckminster Fuller's Dymaxion map. When the spherical polyhedron faces are transformed to the faces of an ordinary polyhedron instead of laid flat in a plane, the result is a polyhedral globe.  Often the polyhedron used is a Platonic solid or Archimedean solid. However, other polyhedra can be used: the AuthaGraph projection makes use of a polyhedron with 96 faces, and the myriahedral projection allows for an arbitrary large number of faces. Although interruptions between faces are common, and more common with an increasing number of faces, some maps avoid them: the Lee conformal projection only has interruptions at its border, and the AuthaGraph projection scales its faces so that the map fills a rectangle without internal interruptions. Some projections can be tesselated to fill the plane, the Lee conformal projection among them.  To a degree, the polyhedron and the projection used to transform each face of the polyhedron can be considered separately, and some projections can be applied to differently shaped faces. The gnomonic projection transforms the edges of spherical polyhedra to straight lines, preserving all polyhedra contained within a hemisphere, so it is a common choice. The Snyder equal-area projection can be applied to any polyhedron with regular faces. The projection used in later versions of the Dymaxion map can be generalized to other equilateral triangular faces, and even to certain quadrilaterals.  Polyhedral map projections are useful for creating discrete global grids, as with the quadrilateralized spherical cube and Icosahedral Snyder Equal Area (ISEA) grids.  History  The earliest known polyhedral projection is the octant projection developed by Leonardo da Vinci or his associate around 1514, which transforms the faces of an octahedron to Reuleaux triangles.  Christian Gottlieb Reichard created a polyhedral globe based on the cube in 1803. An icosahedral globe appeared in 1851. Polyhedral globes cheaply constructed from cardboard were popular for a time in Europe.  Projections based on dihedra begin appearing with the Peirce quincuncial projection in 1879, Guyou hemisphere-in-a-square projection in 1887, and Adams hemisphere-in-a-square projection in 1925. Although the dihedra are not traditional polyhedra they are spherical polyhedra, and the methods used in these projections are also used in other polyhedral projections. In the same work as the hemisphere-in-a-square projection, Adams created maps depicting the entire globe in a rhombus, hexagon, and hexagram.  Bernard J. S. Cahill invented the ""butterfly map"", based on the octahedron, in 1909. This was generalized into the Cahill–Keyes projection in 1975 and the Waterman butterfly projection in 1996. Cahill's work was also influential on Fuller's Dymaxion maps: his first version, based on a cuboctahedron, was published in 1943, and his second, based on an icosahedron, was published in 1954.  The quadrilateralized spherical cube was devised in 1975 for the Cosmic Background Explorer project.

Henning Alexander von Kleist,"Henning Alexander von Kleist (1676/77–1749) was an 18th-century Prussian field marshal. He fought in the War of Spanish Succession, the Great Northern War, and in the Wars of Austrian Succession.  In particular, his actions at the Battle of Mollwitz brought him acclaim, although he had long been a stalwart supporter of Prussian military developments by the Prussian kings Frederick (1740–1786) and Frederick William I (1713–1740).  Family Kleist belonged to an old Pomeranian family that stemmed from the year 1175, and the family served the Duke Bogislaw X, Duke of Pomerania in his wars. In the 14th century, the family divided into three lines, from three brothers.  The oldest line was the Dubberow-Tuchow line; the Muttrin-Damen line was second, and the third was Bilnow-Raddatz, which ended in 1784.  In total, the Kleist line produced more than 19 generals, and an assortment of poets, inventors, scientists, and philosophers.  Henning Alexander von Kleist was born on 4 May in 1676 or 1677 in Raddatz in Pomerania. He was the third son of Joachim Daniel von Kleist. and his first wife, Maria Catherine von Ramel.  His father married three times.  The first wife, Maria Catherine von Ramel, 18 May 1644, 1672 married, and died 3 January 1685.  She was the second daughter of Heinrich von Ramel and Else Sophia von Münchow, from Bulgrin.  She bore four sons, and one daughter: Jürgen (died before 1688) Philipp Heinrich. Initially served in Prussian military, but after a duel, left Prussia and settled in Brussels.  There he married Antonia Catharine van der Linden on 26 February 1704.  He entered French service as a lieutenant in the Regiment de la Mare, fought in the War of Spanish Succession and died on 10 September 1709, in the Battle of Malplaquet.  He had one son, Ludwig, who died on 18 May 1780, without legitimate descendants. Henning Alexander (1676–1747) Maria Catherine 10 February 1677, 23 May 1701 married Jürgen Heinrich von Kleist (of Raddtz), 27 February 1753 (in Juchow). Richard Christian, called himself Richard; served in the military, Infantry Regiment Borck (No 33z)., By 7 May 1714, he was Major, 24 July–4 August 1718, stationed in Colberg as commander.  22 October 1718, Lt Colonel with the Infantry Regiment Mosel. Died in Wesel 1723. Leopold, died without male issue. Balthazar Gustav 16 April 1689–8 April 1694.  Military service  Kleist served in the Prussian military during the reigns of three kings: Frederick I, Frederick William I, and Frederick the Great. He joined the Prussian military in the Alt-Anhalt Regiment in 1698 or 1699, and saw active service continuously from the War of Spanish Succession, which began in 1701, until the Peace of Utrecht in 1713: he served in campaigns in the Netherlands, France and the Italian states under the command of Leopold I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau, known as the Old Dessauer (der alte Dessauer). Consequently, he learned the military craft under the leadership of one of the foremost infantry commanders of the age. He fought at the memorable Battle of Blenheim in 1704 in the wing commanded by Prince Eugene of Savoy. During the 1704 campaign, he also saw action under the leadership of the legendary Türken-Louis.  After the victories in southern Germany, his regiment went to northern Italy, where it participated in the fighting of Cassano in 1705.  He also helped to break the siege at Turin in 1706, as part of the relief column that attacked the French army. Subsequently, he served in the Great Northern War (1705–1721), and participated in the lengthy Siege of Stralsund (1711–15). He acquired the patent as Chief (Inhaber) of his regiment in 1718, which he held until retirement in 1723.  In 1726 he was recalled to service by Frederick William I. In 1730 he acquired the patent as proprietor of the Old Prussian Infantry Regiment, which, in 1806 became regiment No. 26.  He held that patent until his death in 1749. During the decade of the 1730s, he was in regular communication with the then-Prince Frederick, and became one of his trusted commanders.  During the War of Austrian Succession, in 1741 as a lieutenant general he commanded the city Kolberg. As a participant in the Battle of Mollwitz, his infantry regiment not only held its line despite the flight of the Prussian cavalry, but subsequently attacked the Austrian line with such ferocity that he and his soldiers received special mention in Kurt Christoph Graf von Schwerin's report. He was wounded in the fighting. The regiment's actions here reflected the iron training imposed by the prince of Anhalt Dessau on his subordinates, and their subsequent training of their own regiments.  In addition, the Prussian infantry benefited not only from the discipline of drill but also the latest in military technology; unlike their Austrian counterparts, they had iron ramrods which allowed them to fire faster and more accurately. After the battle, he was made a Knight of the Order of the Black Eagle on 15 April 1741, and later awarded the Order Pour le Mérite. During the Silesian Wars, in 1744 he acquired as war booty the gold-plated carriage originally belonging to Jan Sobieski; Kleist gave the carriage to his local church.  In 1745 Kleist was promoted to General of Infantry and two years later, in 1747, to field marshal, at the conclusion of a grand troop revue. He was promoted at the same time as Count Friedrich Ludwig, Graf zu Dohna-Carwinden, von Kalckstein (Frederick's educator and lifelong Councillor), Joachim Christof von Jeetze and Dietrich of Anhalt-Dessau. He became ill in 1749; von Kleist died on 22 August, at age of 73.  Descendants Kleist married Albertine Marie von Biedersee, daughter of Georg Burchardt of Biedersee from Ilberstädt, who died on 23 June 1731 in Rindbett. She bore him seven sons and three daughters. Nicholas Valentine, died as a child. Charlotte Louisa, married Conrad von der Golz Friedrich Wilhelm, born c January 1718. but this child also died young. Leopold, born 29 January 1719 in Hall. He entered military service in the Munchow regiment (later regiment No. 36) on 7 September 1738, and was promoted to first lieutenant on 6 August 1741. He attained the rank of colonel, and died in 1787 in Neuenhagen bei Cöslin.

He eventually inherited the family properties of Raddatz line. He purchased a position as an ensign in 1755.  In the Seven Years' War he was a captain of the Pomeranian battalion Stosch,  and served from 1760–1762.  He y advanced to the position of major before he left military service.  In 1768 he lived in Dutzerow, a property he purchased. He married three times.  One wife bore him son, but died in 1760 with the boy. The male Raddatzline ended in 1793, with his death.

Far Eastern University,"Far Eastern University (Filipino: Pamantasan ng Dulong Silangan), also known simply as FEU, is a private research university in Manila, Philippines. Created by the merger of Far Eastern College and the Institute of Accounts, Business, and Finance, FEU became a university in 1934 under the guidance of its first president, Nicanor Reyes Sr.    The first accountancy and business school for Filipinos, the university, through the years, has expanded its course offerings to the arts and sciences, architecture, fine arts, education, engineering, computer studies, graduate studies, tourism and hotel management, law, nursing, and medicine. FEU has five campuses located in Metro Manila and Cavite. It offers programs from elementary, secondary, tertiary, to graduate school.  FEU Manila comprises several Institutes that offer specific programs. The accountancy program, along with its other undergraduate programs, have received the highest Level IV accreditation from the Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities Commission on Accreditation (PACUCOA). The Commission on Higher Education (CHED) has also granted it as a Center of Development in Business Administration and a Center of Excellence for Teacher Education.  Since its establishment in 1928, FEU has produced national artists, business tycoons, ambassadors, justices of the Supreme Court and other judicial bodies, technocrats in private and government sectors, finance wizards, acclaimed physicians, nurses, educators, theater and media luminaries and so many others in different fields of expertise.  History The Far Eastern University was founded in November 1933 when the Far Eastern College and the Institute of Accounts, Business, and Finance (IABF) merged. Far Eastern College, founded in 1919 by Vicente K. Fabella (the first Filipino CPA), Nicanor Maronilla-Seva, Francisco Africa, Pedro Cortez, and Salvador Unson, had been a liberal arts college in Quiapo; while the IABF had been established (originally under the name Institute of Accountancy) by Francisco Dalupan Sr. and Nicanor Reyes Sr., then head of the Department of Economics at the University of the Philippines, with a number of other prominent educators in 1928. IABF had been originally predominately used by night students, and the new University, which was supported by the tuition provided by its students rather than government grants, soon demonstrated that a private university was financially sustainable in the Philippines.  In the early 1930s, FEU was housed in a converted tobacco factory (La Oriente Fabrica de Tabacos y Compania; boundary of Quiapo and Sampaloc district lots) already present on the  property lot owned by Sulucan Hill subdivision. Due to the widening of the street that became Quezon Blvd., the original building designed and built by Architect Pablo Antonio Sr. (National Artist for Architecture) was demolished and had to be rebuilt on a bigger scale on what is the present campus of FEU.  In 1934, the Institute of Law was founded. Two years later, the Institute of Technology was founded, with Fransisco Santana its first dean. In April 1938, the FEU Junior College was opened in Lingayen, Pangasinan.  Nicanor Reyes Sr. was the first founding president of the university, which spent its early years establishing several of its institutes, including those of Law and Technology. Reyes Sr. commissioned Architect Pablo S. Antonio Sr., his brother in law and husband of his sister Marina del Rosario Reyes-Antonio, who would later be titled as National Artist under the National Artist of the Philippines awards, to construct the main building for the school. In 1939, the Nicanor B. Reyes Sr. Hall, which would later house the main library at third level and Institute of Accounts, Business and Finance, opened. Two other buildings by Antonio, the Girls’ High School Building and Boys High School Building, followed in 1940 and 1941, by which year FEU had 10,000 registered students, with an international student population of 400. Then Philippine President Manuel L. Quezon hailed and called FEU ""the best non-sectarian institution in the country.""  In 1941, FEU also had the first ROTC quartermaster and ROTC finance units in the Philippines. During the American colonial period FEU ROTC was notable for having the first Coastal Artillery unit in the Philippines. During World War II, FEU cadets fought in Bataan with the Second Infantry Division. FEU constituted the majority of cadets who received armor training. These cadets were trained to operate the American M5 light tank. At the time that the FEU's coast artillery unit was formed, the Philippine Army's Coast Artillery was equipped with the 155mm GPF gun. During the Philippine–American War, the Philippine coast artillery had one 150mm Ordóñez gun. It is said that of all the Philippine colleges whose students and alumni volunteered for military service at the outbreak of the Pacific War in 1941, FEU men formed the greatest number.  In 1942, the Far Eastern University campus was used as a multi-functional facility by the Imperial Japanese Army Transportation Corps. It was later used as the Prisoner of War Bureau for the Japanese Army.  During World War II, the campus was occupied by the Imperial Japanese Army as their base. The main building sustained bullet damage while the other three buildings (Girls High, Boys High, and the old Technology Building) did not.  Nicanor B. Reyes Sr. having been killed during the Japanese occupation, Hermengildo B. Reyes was appointed the second president of the university when it reopened in 1945.  The university was re-opened in October 1945 despite the use of most of its facilities by the American forces until their departure in May 1946, the post-liberation years saw the renaissance of FEU with its massive expansion of facilities aimed at meeting the demands of modern and relevant education in the country and the increasing student population. FEU was once named as the “Largest University in Asia”, in the early 1950s when its enrollment passed near 50,000 students.  Thereafter, FEU continued to expand, with the opening of the Science Building and the establishment of the Institute of Medicine and the School of Nursing. In 1955, the FEU Hospital was inaugurated. Humanities were introduced in 1959, and in 1970 the Institute of Architecture and Fine Arts opened. Also in 1970, the for-profit status of the Institute of Medicine, School of Medical Technology, FEU Hospital and the Student Health Service Clinic was altered, when these were converted into the Far Eastern University – Nicanor Reyes Medical Foundation, a non-stock, non-profit educational foundation.  In 1989, Nicanor Reyes Jr. introduced substantial revitalization to FEU that took place over a number of years, with renovation and modernization of facilities and grounds and upgrading of the university's educational standard. This resulted in the accreditation of the Institute of Arts and Sciences, the Institute of Education, and the Institute of Accounts, Business and Finance, and, in the mid-1990s, the deregulation of the university by the Commission on Higher Education. The auditorium was upgraded to accommodate modern stage productions and the new twice-monthly presentations by local and international artists established by the President's Committee on Culture. The university also prioritized publication, launching a number of scholarly journals, and began networking with other institutions nationally and abroad.  After careful study of the technology program, the administration in 1992 decided to phase it out in favor of a computer technology program forged with the East Asia Computer Center, Inc. which offered degrees in computer science and certificate courses.  In 2010, FEU established the Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management and the FEU Makati campus, which started its operations by June of the same year. FEU Makati offer master's degree program in Business Administration and Baccalaureate programs in Accountancy, Accounting Technology, Information Technology and Business Administration.  Corporate  The Far Eastern University, Incorporated () is a domestic non-sectarian educational institution founded in June 1928 and was registered and incorporated with the Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission on October 27, 1933. On October 27, 1983, the university extended its corporate life to another 50 years. The university became a listed corporation in the PSE on July 11, 1986. It has been noted as the leading proprietary university in the Philippines.  The company operates through three segments: education, real estate and investment activities. Its geographical segments include Manila, Makati and Cavite.  The university's major subsidiaries include: Far Eastern College – Silang, Inc. (FECSI), East Asia Computer Center, Inc. (EACCI), Fern Realty Corporation (FRC), FEU Alabang, Inc. and FEU High School, Inc. Similar to the university, FECSI, EACCI, FEU Alabang, Inc. and FEU High School, Inc. were established to operate as educational institutions offering general courses of study. In April 2016, FEU entered into a share purchase agreement to acquire an initial 80% of Roosevelt College, Inc.  In 2019, FEU has entered into a joint venture with the Technological Institute of the Philippines to launch Edustria, a senior high school in Batangas.  University emblems  The university seal  The FEU Coat of Arms depicts a Sarimanok holding a kalasag. Inside the kalasag is an 8 pointed star with a bamboo scroll under it, inscribed with the baybayin letters “KKK”. Meanwhile, the university seal has the Coat of Arms housed inside a green ellipse with gold outline, surrounded with the university's name in baybayin-inspired font and the IABF's founding year at the bottom.   The logo and font were designed by Galo Ocampo, the Father of Philippine Heraldry.  FEU is one of the first universities in the country to be established by a Filipino. Thus, in 1961, the university wanted to showcase the Sarimanok-inspired coat of arms, as proposed by former Institute of Arts and Sciences Dean Alejando Roces; for it projects the nationalistic spirit upon which the university was founded. It also serves as the link between the past and present.  The eight pointed star in the kalasag represents the 8 original institutes: Institute of Accounts, Business and Finance, Institute of Education, Institute of Arts and Sciences, Institute of Technology, Institute of Law, Institute of Medicine, Institute of Nursing and Institute of Graduate Studies.  The ""KKK"" inscription means Katotohanan (Truth), Kagandahan (Beauty), and Kabutihan (Goodness).  The university colors  Green and Gold are the university's official colors. Green is for hope, representing Rizal's ""Fair hope of the Fatherland"" while Gold represents the golden opportunity for the university to serve the youth and her alumni to serve the country.The university mascot  The tamaraw is the mascot of every FEU athletic team. Hence, it is the nickname of every FEU student (Tams). Known scientifically as “Bubalus mindorensis”, it is a rare animal found only in the island of Mindoro. Symbolically enough, the tamaraw is one of the most intelligent, pugnacious and aggressive of our animal species just as the university is known for its advanced, progressive policy in contemporary education.  The university mace  The mace is the symbol of the office of the university president. It is used on every formal events.  Manila Campus FEU's campus is noted for a number of historical Art Deco buildings preserved from the first half of the 20th century. Among the buildings on FEU's campus complex, five by late Ar. Pablo S. Antonio Sr., garnered recognition in 2005 from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), who bestowed the Asia Pacific Heritage Award for Cultural Heritage on the university for ""the outstanding preservation of its Art Deco structures.""The buildings include the Nicanor B. Reyes Sr. Hall, the Admissions Building, the Architecture and Fine Arts Building, the Administration Building, and the Science Building. The Cultural Center of the Philippines also recognized the historical legacy of the buildings with a marker. Other historical buildings on the campus include the 1950s FEU Chapel and the Arts Building, which represent the International Style.  The university maintains various facilities, such as an electronic library, various types of laboratories, an auditorium, audio-visual and multimedia rooms, technology-based gate security and enrollment system, and gymnasiums.  Due to  FEU's mission to preserve and care for the environment, the university has a green and eco-friendly campus landscape and is famously called as the ""Oasis of the University Belt"".  History   During the 1930s, there was a heavy influence of American culture especially in the field of technology and construction that was reflected in the lives of the Filipinos. Concrete and steel were used by the Americans and was found to be the suitable materials for the tropical environment. These were materialized by Arch. Pablo S. Antonio Sr. in creating the FEU campus buildings that reflected both the university's and the country's vision and showed his personal transition from Art Deco to the International Style. The buildings were constructed between the years 1939 to 1950.  Heritage Buildings of FEU Manila Campus  Nicanor B. Reyes Sr. Hall The Nicanor B. Reyes Sr. Hall, named after the founder of the FEU, is a long, low-rise U-shaped building facing Quezon Boulevard beside the Alfredo Reyes Hall. The building was constructed in 1939 by National Artist Arch. Pablo Antonio. The distinct character of the massive façade are the sets of protruded vertical volumes located on both ends of the structure.  Attention to details is another design focus of the architecture of Pablo S. Antonio Sr. The heavy influence of Art Deco in his architectural style is seen even in transitional elements like the stairs. The outdoor stairs that joins the walkway at the second floor has layers of thin concrete slabs that swirl in waves above the rigid geometry of the handrail.  The physical envelope of the building is one of the examples of classic Philippine Art Deco emphasizing the play on geometric forms.  Administration Building  The FEU Administration Building was also designed by Arch. Antonio Sr. a decade after the Nicanor B. Reyes Sr. Hall. It is located at the opposite end of the campus quadrangle that features a façade with geometric architectural details, horizontal windows, and a balcony that extends into a viewing deck at the second floor to observe the activities in the quadrangle. The Administration lobby has floor tiles made of Carrara Marble, the same material used by Michelangelo in his mother and child sculpture La Pieta and also used in New York's Grand Central Station.  It houses the works of many known Filipino artists, most of them in the Art Deco era. One work is a mural done by Antonio Gonzales Dumlao, which conveys the university's mission; while Italian sculptor Francesco Ricardo Monti did a bas-relief on the lobby depicting the history of the Philippines. The Art Deco-inspired FEU Auditorium can be found inside the Administration Building.  Architecture and Fine Arts Building  The building is one of the twin edifices flanking the Administration Building. It is the third building designed by Arch. Antonio Sr., still in the Art Deco Style. Constructed in 1941, it used to house the Boys' High School, which was originally in the basic education program of the university. It also used to house the Law and Nursing programs before being handed to the IARFA. Admissions Building Built in 1940, the Admissions Building is the mirror image of the Architecture & Fine Arts Building. The building was initially used by the Girls' High School, and in 1983, became home to the Institute of Medicine. In 2015, the building has been renovated and changed its name from FEU-East Asia College Building to the FEU Main Building, which was formerly used  by FEU-EAC students.  Science Building The seven-story building erected in 1950 was the last designed building by Arch. Antonio Sr. in what is considered a transition of style between Art Deco and the post World War 2 International Style. In 1990, an earthquake caused structural damages to the building making it necessary to demolish the top two floors. By the late 2013, a sixth floor was added. The building now houses the Department of Medical Technology, Psychology, Biology and Mathematics.  Auditorium   FEU's Auditorium is designed by Pablo Antonio Sr., National Artist for Architecture, in 1949. It was regarded as the first ""Cultural Center of the Philippines"", and also, the very first fully air-conditioned auditorium in the country which can accommodate 1000 spectators. The Auditorium was home to renowned orchestras. It featured dances from Manila Ballet Academy, New York City Center Ballet, and Martha Graham – an American dancer and one of the twentieth century revolutionary artists. It also became the venue of major theatrical productions like Bastien and Bastienne – created by two National Artists, Nick Joaquin (on words) and Cesar Legaspi (on scenic designs).In addition, it was in FEU where Sarah Joaquin–actress, writer, director, and former Head of the Drama Department–showcased her talents through presentation of classic and contemporary plays. To this date, the auditorium upholds this legacy by accommodating more notable performances from artists here and abroad.  SCA Chapel   Another masterpiece is within campus is the Student Council Association (SCA) Chapel. Inaugurated on the 8th of December 1957, the SCA Chapel is where religious activities of faculty, personnel, and students are held. Its interior features a mural by Carlos “Botong” Francisco, proclaimed National Artist in 1973 and discoverer of Angono Petroglyphs (which is the oldest known work of art in the Philippines). His painting 14 Stations of the Cross encompasses 260 degrees of one's visual range. The SCA Chapel's façade is the richly colored tile mosaic of Our Lady of Fatima by Vicente Manansala, also a National Artist who developed the transparent cubism technique apparent in this piece of art.  Nicanor B. Reyes Sr. Memorial Square  In the middle of the campus rests this landmark and favorite backdrop for picture-taking in the campus. Erected in commemoration of the university's 40th anniversary, it consists of a 65-foot flagpole on a platform surrounded on all sides with brass sculpture, also done by Manansala, which interprets the late founder's philosophy of education. It represents the professional disciplines offered by the university.  FEU Library   Located on the second and third floors of the Nicanor Reyes Hall, the Library has a collection of books that falls under Circulation, Reserve, Reference, Filipiniana, and Periodical sections. These can easily be accessed using the Online Public Access Catalog (OPAC) of FEU, its online database of all its print and multi-media resources. The Electronic Library is also available to provide members of the academic community highly effective learning experiences and services through the web and internet technologies as an extension of the services of the conventional library.  The Philippine Association of Academic Research Librarians, Inc. (PAARL) honored the library with the Outstanding Academic/Research Library Award during the PAARL 2012 Awards. The FEU library was recognized for its outstanding contribution to academic and research librarianship and library development along with leadership in regional library management, education and training, information and documentation services.  Academics  Far Eastern University offers 24 undergraduate programs, 17 graduate degree programs, and a law school through its seven institutes, while the Institute of Technology offers 9 undergraduate programs leading to engineering and computer studies. The university offers secondary, post-secondary, and certification courses as well. Since 2020, FEU Manila holds extension programs in its Cavite campus   The university runs on a semestral academic system. An academic year starts in the second week of August and ends in May. The university is supervised by the Board of Trustees, which is made up of academic practitioners and specialists from various disciplines.  Students who wish to study in the university must pass the College Entrance Exam (FEUCAT). However, due to the COVID-19 global pandemic, since SY 2020-2021, the FEUCAT is replaced by the FEU Student Placement for Admission to College Education (SPACE), wherein academic performance in Grades 11 and 12 are the basis for admissions.  Grading system  An FEU student's final grade for a course generally comes in the form of a letter, which is a summary of their performance in the formative and summative assessments. A is given a value of 4, B+ 3.5, B 3, C+ 2.5, C 2, D+ 1.5, D 1, and F 0. The passing mark for all university courses regardless of program is 50%.  Scholarship Grants  FEU funds an average of over 3,500 scholars every year, providing about 11% of the total student population. Scholarships are granted to academically qualified students, financially challenged yet deserving individuals, and university representatives in different fields of service and interests.

Dihu,"The dihu (低胡, pinyin: dīhú) is a large bowed string instrument from China. It has a large soundbox covered on one end with snakeskin. Like most other members of the huqin family of instruments, it has two strings and is held vertically. The instrument's name derives from ""dī,"" meaning ""low,"" and ""hú"" (short for huqin).  Sizes The instrument comes in three sizes: The xiaodihu (小低胡, also called dahu or cizhonghu), pitched one octave below the erhu (tuned D-A, with its lowest D one whole step above the viola's lowest C). It is the tenor member of the erhu family (the erhu being the soprano member and the zhonghu being the alto member). The zhongdihu (中低胡, pitched one octave below the zhonghu, (tuned G-D, as the middle strings of the cello). It is the bass member of the erhu family. The dadihu (大低胡, pitched one octave below the xiaodihu and two octaves below the erhu (tuned D-A, with its lowest D one whole step above the cello's lowest C). It is the contrabass member of the erhu family.  Overview The dihu family was developed for orchestral use in the 1930s as lower members of the erhu family (the erhu being the soprano member and the zhonghu being the alto member) to increase the pitch range of the instruments used in a Chinese orchestra and allow music with harmony to be played.  However, by the late 20th century it had largely fallen into disuse, part of the reason being that it is unwieldy to play. Also, the fact that (like other instruments in the huqin family) the bow passes between the instrument's two strings means that playing pizzicato is difficult; thus, the larger four-string gehu and diyingehu (or cello or double bass) are generally used in Chinese orchestras for the lower bowed string voices instead.

Rivière des Chenaux,"The rivière des Chenaux (English: Channel river) is a tributary of the Lombrette River flowing on the north shore of the Saint Lawrence river, in the administrative region of Capitale-Nationale, in the province of Quebec, in Canada. This river flows consecutively through the regional county municipalities (MRC) of:  Charlevoix Regional County Municipality: in the municipality of Petite-Rivière-Saint-François;  La Côte-de-Beaupré Regional County Municipality: in the municipality of Saint-Tite-des-Caps.  This small valley is mainly served by the Route 138 which normally runs along the north shore of the St. Lawrence River; however, it distances itself from the river in this area of Charlevoix. The route 360 serves the lower part. Forestry is the main economic activity in this valley; second-hand tourist activities.  The surface of the Chenaux River is generally frozen from the beginning of December until the end of March; however, safe traffic on the ice is generally from mid-December to mid-March. The water level of the river varies with the seasons and the precipitation; the spring flood occurs in March or April.  Geography  The Chenaux River rises in Petite-Rivière-Saint-François at the mouth of Lac Fortin (length: ; altitude of ). This small lake between the mountains is located south of Lac Gagné and southwest of Lac la Flippe at:   east of the west bank of the St. Lawrence River;   south-west of the center of the village of Petite-Rivière-Saint-François;   north of the village center of Saint-Tite-des-Caps;   northeast of downtown Quebec.  From the mouth of Lake Fortin, the course of the rivière des Chenaux descends with a drop of  over  especially in the forest area and parallel to the edge of the Laurentian plateau, 4 to 5 km away, according to the following segments:    south, to the outlet (from the west) of a small lake;   towards the south-east by forming numerous small snakes in places, up to the outlet (coming from the south-east) of a lake;   first towards the west, then towards the south, until the outlet (coming from the west) of a small lake;   to the south, forming a hook towards the west at the end of the segment and crossing Lac des Chenaux (length: ; altitude: ), up to its mouth;   to the south, branching off mid-segment east, to a stream (coming from the north);   to the south in the forest zone, while winding in places, until the outlet of the unidentified stream (coming from the west);   first towards the east, then towards the south-east in the agricultural and forestry zone by crossing the route 360, until its mouth.  The Chenaux river flows on the west bank of the Lombrette river, in Saint-Tite-des-Caps, in an area near Domaine-Lombrette, between route 360 and route 138. This confluence is located at:   east of the west bank of the St. Lawrence River;   north of the village center of Saint-Tite-des-Caps;   south-west of the center of the village of Petite-Rivière-Saint-François;   northeast of downtown Quebec.  From the mouth of the Chenaux river, the current descends on  southwards the course of the Lombrette River, then on  generally south by the course of the Sainte-Anne River, to the northwest shore of the Saint-Laurent river.  Toponymy  The toponym ""rivière des Chenaux"" was formalized on December 5, 1968 at the Place Names Bank of the Commission de toponymie du Québec.

"Springside (Poughkeepsie, New York)","Springside was the estate of Matthew Vassar in Poughkeepsie, New York, United States. It is located on Academy Street just off US 9. Detailed plans for a landscape, villa, and complex of farm buildings were drawn up by the influential Andrew Jackson Downing with assistance of Calvert Vaux prior to the former's death. The landscaping was completed and remains Downing's most intact surviving landscape, but only a few of the buildings he planned were ever built; most have since been lost to fire and structural failure. A cottage where Vassar resided was dismantled and removed in the mid-1970s. Its facade is on display in the New York State Museum.  Downing's landscape, in the English landscape gardening tradition, has survived several serious efforts to redevelop the property in the last half-century due to opposition from local preservationists. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Matthew Vassar Estate, and further it was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1969, but the estate was not permanently protected for almost two decades, when a lawsuit was settled with the transfer of the land to its current owners, Springside Landscape Restoration.  History  Springside's development took up much of the last two years of Downing's life, and the latter years of Vassar's. The unfinished estate was maintained and developed by several other families for a century afterward. Their descendants were more amenable to selling the land for development in the years afterward, which led in turn to the efforts to protect and restore it.  Planning and development under Vassar  The Springside property was the ""Allen farm"", first a family farm, then an ornamental farm of roughly 45 acres (18 ha), twice its current size. It takes its name from a spring on the property. It was considered as a site for a cemetery by the then-village of Poughkeepsie in 1848. Vassar, a village trustee and founder of the nearby college that bears his name, bought the property from its last owner George Bloom Evertson   for $8,000, intending to sell subscriptions to future plots at the cemetery to local investors, a common practice at the time. However, there were few takers. He had planned to develop the property as a private summer estate himself if the cemetery plan failed, and so he contracted Downing, who lived downriver in Newburgh, to begin planning the landscape for the property.  By 1851, Downing, in collaboration with his associate Calvert Vaux and Vassar, had detailed landscape plans ready. The next year, the city of Poughkeepsie chose another site for the cemetery, ending that possibility. Downing's death in a steamboat boiler explosion the following year did not halt development, as Vassar and Vaux continued along the lines Downing had established. At least two of Downing's planned structures, a barn and a gardeners' cottage, were built, and he eventually invested $100,000 in developing the site. The villa they designed to be the main house of the estate, a semi-Jacobethan work, was abandoned (although artists' renderings survive), since Vassar preferred the cottage as a residence.  As Springside continued to grow and develop, Vassar regularly opened the lands to the public until he retired to it full-time in 1867, the year before his death. It became a popular place to visit and inspired poetry and songs. One visitor, Russell Comstock, wrote:  After Vassar After Vassar's death, the lands were divided among several other local families, who continued to work the landscape. Judge Homer Nelson, New York's Secretary of State, bought the southern half of the property and renamed it Hudson Knolls. He lived elsewhere while a boardinghouse operated on the site. The northern half was purchased by local shoe manufacturer John Whitehouse, who merged it with his own adjoining property to the west of the site, retaining the Springside name. It passed to his son-in-law Eugene Howell upon his death, who kept up the landscape, at one point using it as a golf course, despite the failure of the shoe factory in 1891.  In 1901, the property was reunified under the ownership of William Nelson Jr. (1829 - 1905), who had previously purchased the southern half when Judge Nelson (to whom he was not related) died in 1881, bought Howells' half following the shoe heir's bankruptcy. Nelson, who for the latter half of the 1800s, ran the Red Ball Line shipping company founded by his father, William Nelson Sr. in the 1820s, lived in the former boardinghouse with his family. He bequeathed it to his wife Marie Christiana Nelson (1860 - 1932), and she in turn passed it on to their children, Gerald, Geraldine, and Gertrude.  The two daughters and son kept the property in the family after Marie Christiana passed on, with the daughters, Geraldine and Gertrude, living out most of their lives there. Gertrude Nelson Fitzpatrick and her husband lived in the cottage, while her sister Geraldine Acker and her husband Earnest R. Acker built a house for themselves in 1929 on the site where Downing had intended for Springside's main house, calling the new house ""Spring Gables"".  Late 20th-century preservation  The combination of private ownership and benign neglect had preserved much of Downing and Vassar's original design for a century. This situation would change as Poughkeepsie experienced rapid growth in the years after World War II.  In 1952 development pressure began when the Poughkeepsie City School District considered Springside as a site for a new high school. In the 1960s, historic preservation efforts started in response to increasing development in the area led to the estate being declared a National Historic Landmark (NHL) in 1969. The NHL designation could not protect the barn complex from being totally destroyed by arson later that month, and the other buildings suffered from continued decay and neglect. Development threats continued as the landowner, developer Robert Ackerman, persuaded the city to rezone the property to make it more amenable to the luxury apartment complex he planned to build. He pledged to protect the gatehouse and cottage, but the landscaping would have substantially altered Downing's original design.  The cottage facade was removed to an Albany warehouse by state order to preserve it in 1976; a quarter-century later it was put on display at the State Museum. Only the foundation clearing remains at the site. In 1982, a nearby condominium complex proposed nearby, and approved by the city, would have cleared most of Downing's remaining landscape. A lawsuit two years later alleging an insufficient environmental impact statement was settled in 1986 with the development of the farm portion of the property, close to Route 9 and the river, while the remaining landscape donated to a newly established non-profit organization, Springside Landscape Preservation, which continues to maintain the property. It took formal title to the land in 1990.  Today, only the Carpenter Gothic gatehouse, a building not found on the original plans, survives. It has been restored to its original colors and is still used as a private residence.  Aesthetics  Downing had become a bestselling writer by expounding on his theories of combining that which was beautiful in nature and art. The buildings at Springside, both planned and built, used consciously rustic board-and-batten siding, emphasized by some of the thousand trees he had transplanted from nearby forests. On the ground, the curving pathways follow the contours of the land beneath them and lead to scenic views, sometimes created by planting evergreens around rock outcrops  Statuary embellishments unite the buildings and grounds, and Downing took advantage of the property's natural drainage to create streams and fountains. Above the spring that gave the property its name, later itself named Willow Spring by Vassar, he placed a statue of a dog, since replaced by one of a young maiden. Ponds, too, were created, their irregular, natural shapes accentuated by similarly shaped islands. Many of these features that Downing pioneered were later replicated by Vaux and his fellow associate of Downing's, Frederick Law Olmsted, in their designs for Central Park and other major parks in American cities.  Today, with most of the buildings no longer extant on the site, the landscape still largely reflects Downing's original plan. Some secondary vegetation has grown in, but the pathways have been restored and many of the original trees remain.

All the Boys Love Mandy Lane,"All the Boys Love Mandy Lane is a 2006 American slasher film directed by Jonathan Levine and starring Amber Heard, Michael Welch, Whitney Able, and Anson Mount. The plot centers on a group of popular high schoolers who invite an attractive outsider, Mandy Lane, to spend the weekend at a secluded ranch house, where they are followed by a merciless killer.  Originally completed in 2006, the film premiered at a number of film festivals throughout 2006 and 2007, including the Toronto International Film Festival, Sitges Film Festival, South by Southwest, and London FrightFest Film Festival. It received a theatrical release in the United Kingdom on February 15, 2008. All the Boys Love Mandy Lane received mixed reviews from critics, with some dismissing the film as ""bogus and compromised"", and others praising its ""grindhouse"" aesthetic and likening its cinematography to the early work of Terrence Malick and Tobe Hooper.  Despite its international attention, the film remained unreleased in the United States for over seven years after it was completed; this was due to complications with its distributor, Senator Entertainment, which went bankrupt shortly after purchasing the film from The Weinstein Company. On March 8, 2013, it was announced that The Weinstein Company had re-acquired the rights to theatrically release the film in the United States. The film became available through video on demand in September 2013, and was given a limited release on October 11, 2013, through a joint contract between Senator Entertainment and Weinstein's subsidiary label Radius-TWC.  Plot At a Texas high school, Mandy Lane blossoms over the summer, attracting her male classmates. One of them, Dylan, invites Mandy to a pool party at his house. She accepts with the provision that her best friend, Emmet can come along. At the party, Dylan bullies and humiliates Emmet until Mandy intervenes. As revenge, Emmet convinces a drunken Dylan to jump from the roof into the pool, but Dylan fails to scale the pool, and smashes his head on the concrete, which kills him.  Nine months later, Mandy has since befriended many of Dylan's popular friends, while Emmet has been subjected to even more intense bullying. Their stoner classmate Red plans a weekend party at his father's remote cattle ranch, and Mandy reluctantly accepts an invitation from Chloe, a popular but insecure cheerleader. Mandy accompanies Red and Chloe, along with several other classmates—reserved football player Bird, and couple Jake and Marlin—to Red's ranch. Upon arriving, they are introduced to Garth, the ranch hand.  That night, Jake gets offended over a joke and storms off to a nearby cattle barn, where Marlin performs oral sex on him. They have another argument, and after he walks back to the house, an unseen assailant knocks Marlin out and breaks her jaw with the barrel of a shotgun. Back at the house, Jake unsuccessfully attempts to woo Mandy. Anxious about Marlin, he takes Red's shotgun and pickup truck to go search for her. He eventually finds her sitting by a remote lake. Upon closer look, he sees her mangled face, and is confronted by Emmet, seeking vengeance for the humiliation he has suffered. Emmet shoots Jake in the head and breaks Marlin's neck, killing both.  Emmet drives back to the ranch in Red's truck and sees the rest of the group on the porch. He shoots fireworks at them. Bird gives chase, believing the driver to be Jake, playing a prank. Emmet confronts Bird and attacks him, eventually slashing his eyes with a knife and stabbing him to death. The rest of the group, drunk and high, fall asleep at the house along with Garth.  The next morning, as the group leaves out the front door, Emmet shoots and wounds Garth. While Mandy tends to Garth, Red and Chloe try to run to Chloe's car. Emmet shoots Red and chases after Chloe. In Garth's shack, Mandy retrieves the keys to his Bronco and finds the bloodied knife that Emmet used to kill Bird. She goes outside to find Chloe being chased in her direction. Mandy embraces Chloe, but then stabs her in the stomach, revealing that she is in league with Emmet.  As Chloe bleeds to death, Mandy and Emmet discuss the suicide pact they had planned. Mandy reveals she had no intention of going through with it, convinced that Emmet agreed to the murders only on the basis of winning her affection. Refusing to let her back down, Emmet prepares to shoot her, but Garth intervenes by wounding Emmet with his shotgun, prompting Emmet to stab him multiple times. Emmet chases Mandy into the fields, where they fall into a ditch filled with cattle carcasses. Mandy grabs a log and defends herself against Emmet's machete. Eventually she gets the upper hand and kills him. She returns to an injured Garth and they drive away from the ranch. Garth thanks Mandy for saving him, assuming she was merely a victim.  A flashback shows the group back at a railroad track, where they took a break from their drive. While the rest goof off, Mandy balances on the tracks and watches her future victims.  Cast  Analysis Several film critics have drawn comparisons between the events in the film and those perpetrated by Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, the teenagers responsible for the Columbine massacre—in particular, the character of Emmet, who in one scene is shown wearing a shirt similar to that worn by Eric Harris on the day of the massacre.  Film scholars Cristelle Maury and David Roche, in their introduction to Women Who Kill: Gender and Sexuality in Film and Series of the Post-Feminist Era (2020), note that the film inverts the trope of the ""final girl"" by revealing her to be a ""diabolical mastermind."" Writing of the revelation, they note: ""As Mandy beckons her, Chloe runs right into her friend's arms, impaling herself on a knife in a back shot that prevents us from anticipating such an outcome...  The twist is merely a millennial update of the ending in Friday the 13th (1980), with two significant differences: Mandy's sadism warrants no justification, and as the film's Final Girl, she is the audience's stand-in.""  Production  Development  The film had initially been conceived in 2003 when writer Jacob Forman, producer Chad Feehan, and production designer Tom Hammock were all students at the American Film Institute. ""I actually started it as my thesis at AFI,"" Feehan told Twitch Film. ""The writer, Jacob Forman and the production designer Tom Hammock and I did it as our thesis together at AFI. We started working on it in 2003, then graduated and got it financed and were able to hire our friends that we graduated with to make the movie. It was obviously quite a journey from 2003 to 2006 when we sold it to the Weinstein Company, and after that it's been pretty trying.""  Levine later told the Austin Chronicle that he and screenwriter Jacob Forman had drawn inspiration from Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) as well as the NBC television series Friday Night Lights and John Hughes films. According to Levine, he and cinematography Darren Genet had also drawn inspiration from The Virgin Suicides (1999) and Dazed and Confused (1993) when developing the film's depiction of teenagers.  Lead performer Amber Heard said that when she received the script for the film in Los Angeles, she felt it was noticeably ""different"".  In an interview, she said, ""There are so many [scripts] you get where it feels like you're reading the same girl over and over again. And then I read this script and I thought it was truly different and that it could be done well. This was a movie that was really under the radar; no one was really talking about it. It didn't have much money and subsequently it didn't get much attention right off the bat.""  Casting In conceiving her character, Heard stated that Mandy Lane ""[represents] many, many real girls. Many real teenagers, especially in America. There are a lot of incidents of this kind of violence in school with the perpetrators being cute teenagers against their classmates. Their victims are their classmates and they're often their bullies.... [Mandy]'s a great representation of all those girls who are insecure and uncomfortable with their sexuality and their power and yet they're strangely intrigued by it and tempted by it.""  Filming Principal photography began on location in Austin, Texas, and nearby Bastrop in 2006, on a budget of $750,000. According to Amber Heard, she spent little time with the rest of the cast when filming wasn't taking place in order to maintain a distance necessary to her character. She also said that the shoot was very low-maintenance, saying, ""Everyone has these expectations, whether they're subconscious or not, of the glamour and how much fun that you can have in L.A. and I went with those same expectations. This was my first shoot, my first leading role. I fly to my hometown, funnily enough, to film and I stand out in this field waiting for my hair and make-up. Instead of the chair, instead of the lights, I stand in the middle of a field and have, literally, a bucket of freshly-dug mud dumped on my head.""  Anson Mount recalled the film shoot as being ""very well organized by the producers. All we had to do was show up to work and have a good time. It was a very aggressive production by what was then a very young company, Occupant.""  Release All the Boys Love Mandy Lane premiered on September 10, 2006, at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival, followed by screenings at the Sitges Film Festival, South by Southwest, London FrightFest Film Festival, the IFI Horrorthon, at the French Cinemathèque.  Distribution Upon the film's premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2006, film executive Harvey Weinstein, ""in characteristically aggressive deal-making mode,"" sought to purchase distribution rights after its screening ended around 1:30 am. By 5:00 am on September 11, 2006, an agreement was reached, and a contract was signed later that morning, with The Weinstein Company officially purchasing global distribution rights for a reported $3.5 million. In the contract, Weinstein committed to giving the film a wide release in the United States under the Weinsteins' Dimension Films branch. Harvey Weinstein's brother Bob Weinstein, who managed Dimension Films, reportedly did not feel the film warranted a wide release: ""I didn't feel that it was the right way to approach an artful film like this,"" he said. A test screening was undertaken in New Jersey, after which less than 30% of the audience reported a positive response, leaving the Weinsteins reluctant to give the film a wide release.  Despite the poor test screening, Dimension Films slated the film for a U.S. release of July 20, 2007. However, due to the subsequent financial failure of the studio's Grindhouse, among other horror films, the Weinstein Company instead sold the film to Senator Entertainment US. Senator, a German company who had acquired distribution rights for the film in Germany and Austria, had recently established a U.S. branch. An American release through Senator never materialized, however, after the company's U.S. branch went out of business in April 2009, leaving the film held in limbo with other unreleased projects.  In 2008, the film was screened at the Gérardmer Film Festival, Lyon L'Étrange Festival, and the Fantasia Film Festival, and received a theatrical release in the United Kingdom on February 15, 2008, through Optimum Releasing. Between 2008 and 2010, it continued to open in various foreign markets, receiving theatrical releases in Germany and Austria (through Senator), as well as in Sweden, Mexico, Peru, and the Netherlands, among others.  At Comic-Con 2010, director Levine and star Heard appeared for a screening of the film, and hinted that a North American release was finally forthcoming, though they did not say when or who would be handling the release. In the spring of 2013, it was reported that The Weinstein Company had re-acquired distribution rights to the film. Several months later, the film was released on demand in North American markets through The Weinstein Company subsidiary, Radius-TWC, on September 6, 2013, and given a limited theatrical release on October 11, 2013, in the United States—over seven years after its premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival.  Box office Upon its release in the United Kingdom in February 2008, the film grossed a total of US$400,851. It garnered an additional $482,500 in Germany upon its June 2008 release there. It was released in various other countries over the course of 2008 and 2009, and by April 2010 had grossed an international total of $1,893,697, more than covering its $750,000 budget.  Critical response The film received mixed reviews upon its initial festival screenings and subsequent European theatrical release in 2008. It holds a 46% approval rating on the website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 68 reviews, with an average rating of 5.1/10. The website's consensus states: ""Mandy Lane has enough wit and craft to spark the horror fans' interest, but is not sufficiently original for mainstream audiences."" On the website Metacritic, the film received a score of 44 out of 100, based on 21 critics, indicating ""mixed or average reviews"".  It received a favorable review from The Globe and Mail, who wrote that it ""displays an intelligence lacking in most teen slasher pics,"" and Film Threat called the film ""a well-shot, [...] semi-cerebral horror film."" eFilmCritic wrote that the film's writing of its titular character is flawed, but it ""evokes the rich landscapes of early Terrence Malick and the grimy grindhouse tales of the ‘70s, converging poetically into its heartmashing climax. This is a film where the blood and carnage doesn’t feel like corn syrup or CGI and each death grows in sadness, not quality."" Bloody Disgusting called it ""a solid entry into the slasher genre and a pretty damn good teen thriller too boot."" Other critics gave the film less flattering reviews, with The Guardian calling it ""bogus and compromised: an unreconstructed horror romp in the guise of a nerdish intellectual."" Slant Magazine said the film ""flaunts its knowledge of classic genre fundamentals but fails to do anything very clever or surprising with them,"" and later compared its cinematography and aesthetic mood to The Virgin Suicides (1999). Tim Robey of The Telegraph called the film ""arrestingly well shot for a low-budget horror,"" but noted that it had an ""anorexic plot.""  The film continued to receive mixed reviews upon its theatrical release in the United States in October 2013. Nicholas Rapold of The New York Times praised the film, noting that ""cinematographer Darren Genet draws from long shots of pursuits and a vaguely 1970s look, which wasn’t cutting-edge during the film’s making but suits the real-time nostalgia of high school activities, even murderous ones,"" and Scott Weinberg of FEARnet said the film ""[brings] a quietly artistic taste of teen-aged sexual politics to a subgenre that's generally disinterested in anything resembling brains, wit, or subtext."" The Los Angeles Times gave the film a positive review as well, calling it ""a small, tightly coiled spellbinder,"" and praised Heard's performance, referring to it as her most ""definitive [performance] to date.""  The New York Post gave the film a less favorable review, calling it ""A slightly artsy attempt to revive the teen slasher movie [that] drifts awkwardly between popcorn entertainment and angsty mood piece."" Christy Lemire of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote that ""[With the opening scene], Levine promisingly sets a dark and disturbing tone. But the vast majority of the film, which takes place nine months later, is a rather standard depiction of the bad kids trying to corrupt the last American virgin."" Lemire also commented on the film's delayed release history, stating: ""Its attempts at examining and subverting the well-worn conventions of the genre in the script from Jacob Forman might have seemed more novel seven years ago. But by now we've seen this approach executed much more effectively—and thrillingly."" The Washington Post, however, praised the film's acting and thematics, writing: ""Thoughtful viewers may detect thematic whiffs of Columbine, blended with Carrie that darken and complicate the film’s aroma of stale blood. Thoughtful viewers? What kind of teen slasher movie is this? Too dumb for the arthouse, but too smart for the mall multiplex, the movie satisfies, paradoxically, precisely because it doesn’t deliver on expectations.""  In his book Nightmare Movies: Horror on Screen Since the 1960s, film scholar Kim Newman likened the film's teenage characters to the troubled youth in works by Richard Linklater or Larry Clark.  Home media All the Boys Love Mandy Lane was released on Blu-ray and DVD in the United Kingdom in a Region 2 format on July 21, 2008, by Optimum Home Entertainment. It was released in North America on Blu-ray and DVD in Region 1 format on December 3, 2013, through Anchor Bay Entertainment.

John Owen (North Carolina politician),"John Owen (August 1787October 9, 1841) was the 24th Governor of the U.S. state of North Carolina and the state's first Democratic governor from 1828 to 1830.  Biography Owen was born in Bladen County, North Carolina; he was the son of Thomas Owen, a judge and member of the state legislature. He briefly attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, but did not earn a degree.  In 1812, Owen was elected to the North Carolina House of Commons and served there for two years; he was later elected to one year in the North Carolina Senate (1819–1820). Named to the North Carolina Council of State in 1824, Owen returned to the state senate in 1827 but was elected Governor by the General Assembly in December 1828, narrowly defeating Richard Dobbs Spaight, Jr. in a vote of 96 to 92.  Owen served two consecutive one-year terms as governor, during which he promoted education and served concurrently as President of the University of North Carolina Board of Trustees. He was nominated for a third term as governor, but declined the nomination; that same year, he lost by one vote (to Willie Mangum) a bid to represent North Carolina in the United States Senate.  In 1835, Owen was a prominent member of the North Carolina Constitutional Convention; there, he supported enfranchisement of land-owning Negro citizens and opposed religious tests for officeholders.  Although during his earlier political life, Owen affiliated himself with the Democratic Party of Andrew Jackson, in 1839, he presided over the first state convention of the emerging Whig Party; three weeks later, he served as president of the National Whig Convention in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Owen was offered the vice-presidential position on the Whig presidential ticket of William Henry Harrison; he turned down the nomination. Had he accepted, Owen might have become President of the United States following Harrison's death early in office instead of John Tyler.  Owen retired to his farm in Chatham County, North Carolina, where he died on October 9, 1841 (Raleigh Register and North-Carolina Gazette, Raleigh, NC, October 19, 1841, page 3, column 5); he is buried in the churchyard of St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church in Pittsboro, North Carolina.

2010 Nebraska Cornhuskers football team,"The 2010 Nebraska Cornhuskers football team represented the University of Nebraska in the 2010 NCAA Division I FBS football season. The team was coached by Bo Pelini and played their home games at Memorial Stadium in Lincoln, Nebraska. They were members of the North Division of the Big 12 Conference. It was Nebraska's 102nd and last season in the Big 12 (including years in the MVIAA/Big Eight) as they began competing in the Big Ten Conference in 2011.  The Cornhuskers finished the season 10–4, 6–2 in the Big 12 and were co champions of the North Division with Missouri. Due to their victory over Missouri, Nebraska represented the North Division in the 2010 Big 12 Championship Game where they were defeated by Oklahoma 20–23. They were invited to the Holiday Bowl for the second consecutive season and played Washington. Despite defeating the Huskies 56–21 during the regular season, the Cornhuskers were defeated 19–7.  Before the season The 2010 Cornhuskers took to the field on Saturday, September 4, 2010 against the Western Kentucky Hilltoppers. The Cornhuskers carried on despite losing a handful of key personnel losses to graduation after 2009, especially Heisman-candidate and #2 overall NFL draft pick DT Ndamukong Suh.  The Nebraska coaching staff remained intact for the third straight year, since the return of Bo Pelini to the program.  During the spring of this year, several NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision teams began publicly discussing potential conference changes, which ultimately gained enough momentum to set off a chain reaction of university conference affiliation changes.  On June 11, 2010, the University of Nebraska–Lincoln announced that its regents unanimously voted to end the university's affiliation with the Big 12 Conference, and would be joining the Big Ten Conference.  The Big Ten Conference unanimously approved Nebraska's official application just hours later, and Nebraska announced that the Cornhusker athletic programs would transition into the Big Ten conference play schedule effective July 1, 2011.  This is Nebraska's last year playing in the Big 12 Conference.  Nebraska's preseason #8 AP ranking was the highest starting rank for Nebraska since Eric Crouch's 2001 Heisman trophy season, which ultimately saw the Cornhuskers playing Miami in the BCS National Championship Game at the Rose Bowl.  Recruiting  Schedule  Roster and coaching staff  Game summaries  Western Kentucky  This was the first ever meeting of the Hilltoppers and Cornhuskers.  Redshirt Freshman QB Taylor Martinez was not revealed as the starter for Nebraska until kickoff, and subsequently became the first freshman quarterback to open a Nebraska season in the history of the program.  On his first carry, Martinez rushed for 46 yards and a touchdown, paving the way for Nebraska to extend its ongoing NCAA record of consecutive season-opening victories to 25.  His 129 rushing yards on the day also marked the first time a Nebraska QB exceeded 100 yards on the ground since 2003, and this was accomplished even while sharing snaps with the second and third string quarterbacks.  The 2010 Blackshirts debut was marred somewhat when they allowed the Western Kentucky squad, which had lost their last 20 games in a row prior to this game, to accumulate 299 all-purpose yards, mostly during a second-half defensive letdown.  Idaho  For the sixth straight year, Nebraska opened the season 2–0.  The 38–17 defeat of the Idaho Vandals in the first ever meeting of these teams improved the Cornhuskers to 22–1 against WAC opponents all-time.  After an unimpressive outing the week prior, the Nebraska defense came forth with a strong defensive attack, holding the Vandals to just 60 yards on the ground and 279 total yards, while notching seven sacks for 80 yards lost.  The Blackshirts intercepted five passes, three of which were converted into scores.  A 28–3 scoring output in the 2nd quarter allowed the Cornhuskers to run away with the game and play some reserve personnel, which allowed the Vandals to outscore Nebraska 14–7 in the second half. Although the Nebraska offense recorded 471 all-purpose yards, numerous miscues resulted in stalled drives and lost opportunities.  The home field win was Nebraska's 375th at Memorial Stadium, and the 500th home win in Lincoln all-time.  Nebraska redshirt freshman QB Taylor Martinez had a second straight 100-yard rushing game, and his 67-yard second-quarter touchdown was the longest by a Nebraska QB since a 70-yard dash by Eric Crouch against Colorado in 2001.  Cornhusker PK Alex Henery accounted for eight points on the day, which was enough to make him the fifth Nebraska player to ever exceed 300 career points.  Despite the win, Nebraska slipped from #6 to #8 in the AP Poll following the game.  Washington, September 2010  Washington was in the second year of a rebuilding project under 2nd-year coach Steve Sarkisian, who took over in 2009 after Washington finished 0–12 the year before, when Nebraska arrived for the first Cornhusker road game of the 2010 season.  Despite Nebraska's #8 AP ranking, the spread was less than ten points in favor of the Cornhuskers as the week leading up to the game. Factoring into the spread was Nebraska's redshirt freshman QB making only his third start ever, and first on the road.  The stature of senior Washington QB Jake Locker also played into the previews, as Locker was considered a top NFL prospect and an early candidate for the Heisman Trophy.  Washington received the ball to start the game but gave up an interception four plays later, just 1:35 into the game. Shortly thereafter Nebraska scored a touchdown and never gave up the lead for the rest of the game.  The Cornhuskers finished the day with 533 all-purpose yards, more than double Washington's totals in each category. This included three Nebraska players totaling over 100 yards of rushing, an accomplishment not met since 2001 and only the fourth time ever in program history. It was also the first time Washington had ever allowed three opponent players to exceed 100 rushing yards. The Cornhusker offense managed over 13 yards per pass attempt and over 7 yards per rush attempt, while the 56 total Nebraska points was the most points ever scored by a non-conference opponent in Husky Stadium's 90-year history, also tying the most points ever scored there by a Washington conference opponent.  An 80-yard touchdown run in the 3rd quarter by Nebraska QB Taylor Martinez was the longest TD run by a freshman QB, and the second-longest run by any Nebraska QB, in program history.  The Blackshirts coverage prevented the Huskies from ever getting consistent momentum, and the highly touted Locker ended the day only 4 of 20 in the air for 70 yards and two interceptions, one of which was returned for a Nebraska TD by junior CB Alfonzo Dennard.  The sole highlight of the day for Washington was ending Nebraska's 10-game streak of holding opponents to 20 points or less.  Nebraska took over the series by moving to 4–3–1 against Washington all time.  South Dakota State  Meeting for the first time since a 58–7 Nebraska victory in 1963, the FCS South Dakota State Jackrabbits were not intimidated by the Memorial Stadium homecoming crowd despite entering the game at 0–2, and gave the flat Cornhuskers the toughest test of the season to date.  The 307th consecutive sellout crowd at Memorial Stadium was the largest crowd that the Jackrabbits team had ever played in front of, and the last two teams to hold Nebraska to fewer than 17 points had been the #20 Oklahoma Sooners and #3 Texas Longhorns.  The game was closer than the 17–3 score would indicate, as the Jackrabbits had two touchdowns nullified by penalties, one of them on an interception returned 66 yards to the end zone.  The large contingent of visiting fans from South Dakota were clearly heard chanting ""Let's Go Rabbits"" in the stadium as the home crowd was silenced by the spirited fight of the visiting team.  While both teams suffered two interceptions each, Nebraska offered up four fumbles on the day, losing one of them to a fumble-free South Dakota State.  Nebraska held the time of possession edge on the game by only 11 seconds, and converted only four of thirteen third downs.  Cornhusker head coach Pelini summed up the Nebraska effort after the game, saying ""We were a bad team.""  Nonetheless, the win moved the Cornhuskers to 2–0 over the Jackrabbits all time, and put Nebraska at 4–0 for the first time since 2005.  Kansas State  Nebraska met Kansas State in Manhattan to open the final Cornhusker Big 12 Conference slate.  It was the 95th time the teams had met, and the last time unless they are matched against each other in a future non-conference game or bowl game.  Redshirt freshman Nebraska QB Taylor Martinez bounced back from his lackluster appearance in the previous contest against South Dakota State, rushing for four touchdowns and 241 yards to set a new all-time Cornhusker quarterback single-game rushing record.  His 370 total yards on the day were the most all-purpose yards set by a Cornhusker freshman at any position in nineteen years.  Martinez's efforts helped propel Nebraska to tally more yards against Kansas State than any other opponent in twenty one years.  The Wildcat offense seemed to have success to start the game, marching down the field on their first possession, until they were stopped on a 4th-and-2 in the Nebraska red zone with no points to show for it.  The Blackshirts subsequently took control of the game defensively, notching their 13th straight game holding an opponent to 21 points or less and helping the Cornhuskers to hand Kansas State head coach Bill Snyder a home field loss, in the stadium named after him, on his 71st birthday.  The Nebraska win moved the Cornhuskers to 5–0 for the first time since 2003, and the series between the programs drew to a close with a Nebraska advantage of 78–15–2.  Texas  These teams came head-to-head for the 14th time in what has frequently been a contentious – if still respectful – clash of conference foes whose games often carry title implications, and often at the expense of the Cornhuskers.  2010 was no exception, as unranked Texas defeated #5 Nebraska in Lincoln, in front of a fired-up home crowd that had long anticipated this contest.  The loss leaves Nebraska 4–10 against Texas all time, and just 1–9 in the last ten attempts.  With Nebraska's departure from the Big 12 Conference following this season, this was the last regular season league meeting of these teams.  Unless they meet again in a future bowl game, there are no scheduled dates for these programs to meet again in the future.  Oklahoma State  The Cornhuskers traveled to Stillwater following a high-profile disappointing loss to Texas the week prior, hoping to bounce back against their first ranked opponent of the year, the #17 Oklahoma State Cowboys. Nebraska QB Taylor Martinez eclipsed the 300-yard mark through the air for the first time in his career, passing for 323 yards and five touchdowns, while adding 112 yards on the ground.  Nebraska's victory improved the Cornhuskers' series lead to 37–5–1, but was only Nebraska's second win in the last five matches between the squads. Their first win in Stillwater since 1995. With Nebraska's departure from the Big 12 Conference following this season, this was the last league meeting of these teams in a series that dates back to when the Cowboys briefly joined the MVIAA from 1925 to 1928. Oklahoma State later returned to the league for good in 1958, leading the conference to be known as the ""Big 8"" for the first time.  Missouri  #7 Missouri arrived in Lincoln to take on Nebraska for the 104th contest between the schools since 1892, trying to make progress to catch up to Nebraska in the series. The Tigers trail behind the Cornhuskers 36–65–3 all-time.  Nebraska's withdrawal from Big 12 play after this year ends a historical league affiliation with the Tigers that dates to 1892, when these two programs joined with Kansas and Iowa to form the Western Interstate University Football Association (WIUFA).  Though the WIUFA disbanded after six seasons, all four WIUFA teams came together again with the formation of the MVIAA in 1907.  The conclusion of the 2010 season will mark the end of a 103-year continuous conference partnership, and leaves the fate of the Victory Bell in question.  Iowa State  Second-year Iowa State Head Coach Paul Rhoads hosted Nebraska in Ames for the first time, as the squads come together for their 105th contest. With Nebraska leaving Big 12 play after this season, this game marked the end of a historical series and conference relationship dating back to 1896, almost as far back as the Nebraska-Missouri series. Nebraska, who leads the all-time series 86–17–2, avenged last year's 7–9 loss, which was Iowa State's first win in Lincoln in 34 years. Nebraska and Iowa State traded scores in the 4th quarter before Nebraska led 31–24 in the final minutes. Iowa State scored a touchdown to make the score 31–30 Nebraska leading. ISU Head Coach Paul Rhoads called a 2-point conversion. With the game on the line, ISU QB Austen Arnaud threw a pass that got intercepted by Nebraska DB Eric Hagg to give Nebraska the overtime win in Ames.  Kansas  Kansas traveled to Lincoln to play the 105th and last game in the NCAA-record longest consecutive season series in all of college football.  This game marked the 117th time overall that the teams have come together to settle things on the field.  Nebraska's victory leaves the series closed for now with a decisive Cornhusker advantage of 91–23–3. It was the first meeting between Kansas and Nebraska since the Jayhawk program was taken over by former legendary Nebraska quarterback Turner Gill.  The departure of Nebraska from the Big 12 marked this game as the probable last game of one of the longest continuous series in the history of NCAA college football, as Kansas and Nebraska have met on the field every year without interruption since 1903, and failed to meet in only two seasons overall since 1892.  No future meetings are scheduled, and the teams are unlikely to see the same field again unless they meet in a future non-conference game or are both selected to meet in a postseason bowl game.  Texas A&M  With Nebraska's departure from the Big 12 Conference following this season, this was the last league meeting of these two teams. The Cornhuskers were penalized 16 times for 145 yards and lost the game 9–6. Several of the calls were controversial, and played key role in the outcome of the game. For example, Texas A&M player Tony Jerod-Eddie grabbed and squeezed the testicles of Nebraska player Ben Cotton when he recovered a fumble, and Cotton was flagged 15 yards when he tried to protect himself.  Following the Cornhuskers' defeat by the Aggies, Nebraska Defensive Coordinator Carl Pelini was involved in an incident with Brandon Jones, a co-owner of a Texas A&M sports site, TexAgs. The photographer stated that Pelini had seized Brandon's camera and broken several pieces from it before throwing them to the ground. Video shows Pelini rushing towards the photographer and camera.  Colorado  Colorado traveled to Lincoln as both teams closed their regular seasons.  This series has produced many amazing and emotional finishes, but this 69th clash was not in doubt for long as Nebraska steadily pulled away for the win to clinch the Big 12 Conference North Division Title and a berth in the Big 12 Championship game.  Colorado was denied a sixth win for the season and thus did not attain bowl eligibility, making this the final game of their 2010 season.  As 2010 was the final year for both teams in the Big 12, the long-running series has drawn to a close with Nebraska in command at 49–18–2.  Oklahoma  For the second year in a row, Nebraska appeared in the Big 12 football championship game.  The team would play their final game as members of the Big 12 against Oklahoma in Arlington, Texas. Nebraska led 17–0 at one point in the first half, before Oklahoma reeled off 17 points of their own. A field goal just before halftime sent Nebraska into halftime with a 20–17 lead. In the second half, Oklahoma held Nebraska scoreless for the first time of the season and managed two field goals in each of the latter periods to win 23–20. Nebraska had 4 turnovers in the game and Oklahoma held a 453–293 yard disadvantage.  Washington–Holiday Bowl  Following Nebraska's loss to Oklahoma, Nebraska was selected as the Big 12's representative at the 2010 Holiday Bowl, which also chose the Washington squad beaten by Nebraska in September, now 6–6, to appear as the final opponent in the Cornhuskers 2010 season. This was Nebraska's second straight Holiday Bowl appearance. Washington had rebounded from a 3–6 start and the demoralizing early season loss to Nebraska, winning out the rest of their season to earn a bowl bid. The Huskies held Nebraska to a single first-half touchdown on their way to winning 19–7.  Rankings  After the season Although there were high hopes for the year, three major goals were not achieved and resulted in a season that ended with a note of disappointment.  After the last-second, one-point loss to Texas in the 2009 Big 12 Championship Game, the squad looked forward to a chance to avenge the loss against the Longhorns and to return to the league title game for the final Big 12 conference championship.  The 2010 Big 12 Championship game was the last league title game for the foreseeable future, as the departure of Nebraska and Colorado from the league dropped the number of members to ten, which is not enough to hold a title game under NCAA rules.  Texas started the season flat and had to face unbeaten Nebraska in Lincoln, which led many media analysts to predict an easy Nebraska win.  Instead, Texas took advantage of Cornhusker mistakes to deny Nebraska a win in the final foreseeable match between the teams.  The Cornhuskers remained on track for an appearance in the Big 12 championship game, clinching an appearance against historical rival Oklahoma.  The Cornhuskers started strong and led 17–0 in the second quarter before the Sooners rallied for 23 points while holding Nebraska to just one more field goal.  Having also lost to Texas A&M in the regular season, the 10–3 Nebraska team was invited to the Holiday Bowl for a rematch with Washington.  Head coach Bo Pelini, 3–0 in bowls all time, was handed his first ever bowl loss at the hands of an inspired Husky squad, and Nebraska suffered its third loss in the previous four games, a mark last seen since the first part of 2008.  Nonetheless, Pelini's overall record improved on the season, to 30–12 (.714) overall, and 17–7 (.708) in the Big 12, and his team won the Big 12 North Division title in each of his three seasons at the helm so far.  This was not as successful a start as the programs of successful former head coaches Bob Devaney, Tom Osborne, or Frank Solich, but was a dramatic improvement over the first three years of his immediate predecessor, Bill Callahan.  Callahan managed to get to just 22–15 (.595) overall and 13–11 (.542) in the league, with  only a single division championship.

Nicky Oppenheimer,"Nicholas F. Oppenheimer (born 8 June 1945) is a South African billionaire businessman. He was formerly the chairman of De Beers diamond mining company and of its subsidiary, the Diamond Trading Company, and former deputy chairman of Anglo American. He is the third richest man in Africa.  Early life Oppenheimer is the son of Bridget (née McCall) and Harry Oppenheimer, and grandson of Anglo American founder Ernest Oppenheimer (the first generation to chair De Beers, from 1929). His father was of German Jewish descent. He was educated at Harrow School and Christ Church, Oxford, where he read Philosophy, Politics and Economics, earning an Oxford MA.  Business career Oppenheimer joined Anglo American in 1968, was appointed a director in 1974, then became deputy chairman in 1983. He resigned in 2001, remaining a non-executive director until 2011.  He was appointed deputy chairman of the then Central Selling Organisation (now Diamond Trading Company) in 1984, and deputy chairman of De Beers Consolidated Mines in 1985. He was also appointed chairman of the Diamond Trading Company in 1985. Chairman of the De Beers Group from 1998 to 2012, he retired when the family stake was sold to Anglo American.  Oppenheimer appeared on the Sunday Times Rich List 2018 as the 23rd richest person in the United Kingdom, with a reported fortune of £5.5 billion. He was ranked as the richest person in South Africa on Forbes list of The World's Billionaires for 2019, with a fortune reported as US$7.3 billion and, again, on its 2020 list, with a reported fortune of US$7.6 billion in August 2020.  Philanthropy The Oppenheimer family has directed much of its philanthropic efforts towards preserving the heritage and cultural importance of the Southern African region, as well as to broader community upliftment in the areas of education, health, nature conservation and the arts. Nicky Oppenheimer and his son Jonathan Oppenheimer established the Brenthurst Foundation in 2005 as a way to contribute to the debate around strategies and policies for strengthening Africa's economic performance and enabling inclusive and sustainable development.  The family has also long been involved in environmental and conservation issues. The Oppenheimer family partnered with De Beers to establish the Diamond Route in 2006 to maximise the potential of their properties for conservation, research and environmental awareness purposes. The Diamond Route links 8 sites across northern South Africa, stretching from Namaqualand on the west coast, to Kimberley, north to Tswalu in the Kalahari, and to the Brenthurst Gardens in Johannesburg, eastwards to Ezemvelo Nature Reserve and northwards to the Venetia Limpopo Nature Reserve in Limpopo Province. Since 2015 Oppenheimer is also a Rhodes Trustee.  Awards In 2003, the Technikon Witwatersrand awarded Oppenheimer an honorary doctorate. He received the Presidential Order of Honor (2004) from the former President of Botswana, Festus Mogae, and an honorary fellowship (2009) from the London Business School.  Personal life In 1968, he married Orcillia ""Strilli"" Lasch, daughter of industrial tycoon Helli Lasch; both are Anglican. His father was born Jewish and converted to Anglicanism.

He was born in Johannesburg to parents who were both teachers at the time.  His father, Nicholas Jnr., taught English literature while his mother, Jeanette, taught mathematics.   Nicky attended primary school at St Mary’s Catholic School on Long Street before moving onto Greyfriars Secondary College where he excelled academically. He graduated from Rhodes University in 1979 as Bachelor of Commerce Honours graduate cum laude.    After graduating university, Nick worked briefly for Price Waterhouse Coopers but left after two years when he decided that he wanted to pursue a career in gold exploration instead.   In 1981, he joined Gold Fields Limited which had been founded by Sir Ernest Shackleton in 1917.   During this period, he became involved in several major discoveries including the world-class TauTona Mine near Carletonville, Gauteng province.  In 1986, he moved back into the family business when he bought out his brother-in-law, Dr Peter Steenkamp, who owned 40% stake in the company.   The following year,  1987 ,he married model Beverly Joubert . Oppenheimer has since become known as ""The Godfather of South African Mining"" due to his involvement in many significant mineral discoveries across the country over more than three decades.

National Memorial of the Republic of Belarus,"The national state memorial ""Khatyn"" of the Republic of Belarus is the central war memorial of Belarus for all victims of the German occupation during the Second World War. It commemorates particularly the more than 600 ""burnt villages"" which, together with their inhabitants, were destroyed in the National Socialist genocide and the Nazi policy of the ""burnt earth"" in Belarus since the beginning of the Second World War. Khatyn was one of them; the village lies about 60 kilometres north of Minsk on the road to Wizebsk in the Logojskij district, in the Minskaja Woblasz.  Background  Of about nine million people who fell into the hands of the Germans in Belarus, about 1.6 to 1.7 million were murdered, namely 700,000 prisoners of war, 500,000 to 550,000 Jews, 345,000 victims of the so-called partisan combat and about 100,000 members of other population groups. In addition, several hundred thousand Belarussians fell in the ranks of the Red Army.  More than 147,000 people died in over 5,000 villages that were completely or partially destroyed. 627 villages were totally destroyed, 186 of them not rebuilt after the war. A total of 345,000 people were killed in German partisan combat in Belarus. Nine out of ten of the victims were not partisans.  Of the total number of 5295 villages destroyed, 3% were destroyed in the first year of war in 1941, 16% in 1942, 63% in 1943 and 18% in 1944.  Frequently state visitors come here to lay a wreath in memory of the more than two million dead.  The destruction of Khatyn and the murder of the villagers was an act of revenge in response to the bombardment of a German motorcade by Belarusian partisans on 22 March 1943, killing the company commander, Captain Hans Woellke, and three Ukrainian members of the Battalion 118 protection team. On the same day Khatyn was plundered and destroyed by Battalion 118 and SS Special Battalion Dirlewanger. They drove the inhabitants first into the village barn, set it on fire and with machine guns shot the people who tried to save themselves from the barn. A total of 149 villagers died, including 75 children. One adult, the then 56-year-old village blacksmith Iosif Kaminskij, and five children survived the destruction of Khatyn and the Second World War. Two more girls were able to flee from the burning barn into the forest and were taken in by inhabitants of the village Khvorosteni, but then died in the destruction of that very village.  The memorial  The memorial was inaugurated on 5 July 1969. It was designed and created by the architects Yuri Gradow, Leonid Lewin, Walentin Sankowitsch and the sculptor Sergej Selichanow. The opening began with a mourning ceremony in Minsk. Delegations from Russia, Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova and other republics of the Soviet Union, from the then twin cities and other foreign guests took part in the ceremony and the trip to Khatyn. This village represents the many destroyed villages in Belarus. The survivor Kaminskij also spoke at the opening ceremony.  The renovation and reconstruction of the State Memorial ""Khatyn"" was completed in July 2004, on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the ""Liberation of Belarus from the German-Fascist Conquerors"" in Khatyn, which was commemorated in the presence of the Presidents of Belarus, Aljaksandr Lukashenka, Russia, Vladimir Putin, and Ukraine, Leonid Kuchma. In July 2004, a photographic exposition was inaugurated at the memorial, commemorating Khatyn, Maly Trostenez and the Ozarichi concentration camp as another example.  The memorial contains many symbols, the three most important of which are probably the memories of Khatyn, the cemetery of the burnt villages and the trees of the rebuilt villages.  Furthermore, the ""eternal flame"" burns in a large black granite stone block on which three birches grow.  This symbolizes the fact that about a quarter of all Belorussian inhabitants died in the Second World War.  Everywhere in the area where the houses of Khatyn village once stood, their floor plans are indicated by concrete beams embedded in the ground. A symbolic chimney juts out into the air as a reminder of each fire ruin. A bell strikes every thirty seconds together with all the other bells in the chimney steles commemorating the destroyed houses. The number and ages of the victims are recorded at each house. At the entrance of the symbolic village there is a six-metre-high bronze sculpture depicting Iosif Kaminskij carrying his dead son Adam in his arms. Behind the sculpture there is also a symbolic reproduction of the village barn, which commemorates the annihilation of the village population.  The cemetery of the burned villages looks like the burial grounds on any modern cemetery. Uniform rows of graves and identical type of lettering. But each of the 185 graves represents a village that was destroyed in the so-called punitive operations. On each grave there is an urn filled with native soil and an inscription with the name of the village and the name of the district where the village used to be, which remained extinct after the war.  The names of 433 Belarusian villages, burned like Khatyn but rebuilt after the war, are immortalized like branches on symbolic ""trees of life"". In the Logojskij district alone, 21 villages and their populations were burned down. After the war 11 villages were rebuilt.  In a long memorial wall, memorial plates with the names and deaths of the concentration camps and extermination sites in Belarus were placed in niches. The path along this wall commemorates over 260 death camps and mass extermination sites of the German SS, the Ordnungspolizei and the Wehrmacht.

Plinian Core,"Plinian Core is a set of vocabulary terms that can be used to describe different aspects of biological species information. Under ""biological species Information"" all kinds of properties or traits related to taxa—biological and non-biological—are included. Thus, for instance, terms pertaining descriptions,  legal aspects, conservation, management, demographics, nomenclature, or related resources are incorporated.  Description   The Plinian Core is aimed to facilitate the exchange of information about the species and upper taxa. 	 What is in scope?  	Species level catalogs of any kind of biological objects or data.   	Terminology associated with biological collection data.   	Striving for compatibility with other biodiversity-related standards.   	Facilitating the addition of components and attributes of biological data.  	What is not in scope?   	Data interchange protocols.   	Non-biodiversity-related data.   	Occurrence level data.   	This standard is named after Pliny the Elder, a very influential figure in the study of the biological species. 	 Plinian Core design requirements includes: ease of use, to be self-contained, able to support data integration from multiple databases, and ability to handle different levels of granularity. Core terms can be grouped in its current version as follows:  	Metadata  	Base Elements  	Record Metadata  	Nomenclature and Classification  	Taxonomic description  	Natural history  	Invasive species  	Habitat and Distribution  	Demography and Threats  	Uses, Management and Conservation  	associatedParty, MeasurementOrFact, References, AncillaryData  Background  Plinian Core started as a collaborative project between Instituto Nacional de Biodiversidad and GBIF Spain in 2005. A series of iterations in which elements were defined and implanted in different projects resulted in a ""Plinian Core Flat"" [deprecated].  As a result, a new development was impulse to overcome them in 2012. New formal requirements, additional input and a will to better support the standard and its documentation, as well as to align it with the processes of TDWG, the world reference body for biodiversity information standards.  A new version, Plinian Core v3.x.x was defined. This provides more flexibility to fully represent the information of a species in a variety of scenarios. New elements to deal with aspects such as IPR, related resources, referenced, etc. were introduced, and elements already included were better-defined and documented.  Partner for the development of Plinian Core in this new phase incorporated the University of Granada (UG, Spain), the Alexander von Humboldt Institute (IAvH, Colombia), the National Commission for the Knowledge and Use of Biodiversity (Conabio, Mexico) and the University of São Paulo (USP, Brazil).  A ""Plinian Core Task Group"" within TDWG ""Interest Group on species Information"" was constituted and currently working on its development.  Levels of the standard  Plinian Core is presented in to levels: the abstract model and the application profiles.  The abstract model (AM), comprising the abstract model schema(xsd)  and the terms' URIs, is the normative part. It is all comprehensive, and allows for different levels of granularity in describing species properties. The AM should be taken as a ""menu"" from which to choose terms and level of detail needed in any specific project.  The subsets of the abstract model intended to be implemented in specific projects are the ""application profiles"" (APs). Besides containing part of the elements of the AM, APs can impose additional specifications on the included elements, such as controlled vocabularies.  Some examples of APs in use follow:  Application profile CONABIO  Application profile INBIO  Application profile GBIF.ES  Application profile Banco de Datos de la Naturaleza.Spain  Application profile SIB-COLOMBIA  Relation to other standards  Plinian incorporates a number of elements already defined by other standards.

The term ""plinian"" comes from the Latin name for Mount Vesuvius in Italy where this type of eruption was first observed by Aristotle around 300 BC. Plinian eruptions are characterized by high volumes of gas-rich magma being released at relatively low pressure into open space above ground level; they can be explosive but not necessarily so.  They may also occur as dome collapses when large amounts of molten rock suddenly escape through cracks within the volcano's edifice.   In either case, the resulting mixture of gases, hot particles, water vapor, and liquid droplets expands rapidly upward under its own weight until it reaches equilibrium between buoyancy forces due to density differences and gravity.    This results in rapid vertical acceleration up to terminal velocities on the order of 100 m/sec., producing extremely dense clouds of fine particulate matter known as tephra.     These clouds rise quickly toward their maximum height before spreading out horizontally over great distances, often covering areas several hundred kilometers across.   Volcanic plumes produced during these events have been recorded rising more than 30 km (19 mi) above sea-level.    As such, Plinian eruptions pose significant hazards both locally near the source region and globally via atmospheric transport processes.",wikipedia,bigscience/bloomz,Plinian Core,0.07643312101910828,0.5333333333333333,0.05587552651938451,0.49772727272727274,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0.021939902684631387,0.024478202286073378,0.019456830158086746,0.0297723292469352,8,0,5,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1

Acacia phasmoides,"Acacia phasmoides, the phantom wattle, is a shrub species that is endemic to south-eastern Australia.  Description It grows to between 1 and 4 metres high and has phyllodes that are 5 to 12.5 cm long and 1 to 2 mm wide. The bright yellow globular flowerheads appear singly or in groups of two in the axils of the phyllodes from September to November, followed by curved seed pods which are 5 to 9 cm long and 2 to 4 mm wide.  Taxonomy The species was formally described in 1967 by botanist Jim Willis  based on plant material collected from Pine Mountain in north-eastern Victoria. It was reclassified as Racosperma phasmoides by Leslie Pedley in 2003 and then transferred back to genus Acacia in 2006.  Distribution Its distribution is limited to a small area on the border between south-eastern New South Wales and north-eastern Victoria. In New South Wales it is found along the southern edge of Woomargama National Park and has an estimated population of  2000 plants. In Victoria it is found in the Burrowa-Pine Mountain National Park from two stands east of the summit of Pine Mountain with nine plants in one stand and between 150 and 250 in the other. The Victorian populations are located approximately  from the New South Wales populations.

Banja Luka International Airport,"Banja Luka International Airport , also known as Mahovljani Airport, after the nearby village of the same name, is an airport located  north northeast of the railway station in the city of Banja Luka, the second largest city in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The airport is managed by the government-owned company ""Aerodromi Republike Srpske"".  History The construction of the Banja Luka International Airport began in 1976. In accordance with the development plans, capacities were built defining Banja Luka as an airport of secondary importance, restricted to domestic air traffic on the territory of Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. After the Bosnian War, Republika Srpska was established with Banja Luka as the de facto capital. That gave Banja Luka Airport new importance and a completely different role. Banja Luka International Airport was opened for civilian air traffic on 18 November 1997. From 1999 to 2003 the airport served as the main hub of Air Srpska, which was the official flag carrier of Republika Srpska. The company was founded by Jat Airways and Government of Republika Srpska. The company ceased all operations in 2003 after increasing debt, and the withdrawal of Jat Airways from the partnership. There were plans for Sky Srpska, a state-owned airline founded in 2007, to start flights, however, the airline, which never had any aircraft, was closed in 2013. The airport's facilities were greatly improved in 2002 and 2003, ahead of the visit by Pope John Paul II to Banja Luka in June 2003.  On 15 December 2010, to celebrate the abolition of visa requirements for Bosnian citizens traveling to the Schengen Area countries, a symbolic charter flight was organised from Banja Luka to Brussels. In 2011, Banja Luka airport handled 8,367 passengers, a rise of 74% compared to 2010. Over the years, the airport has had flights connecting Banja Luka to Athens, Belgrade, Copenhagen, Frankfurt, Ljubljana, Salzburg, Tivat, and Vienna, partly thanks to Air Srpska which was an airline based at the airport. Austrian Airlines and Montenegro Airlines served Banja Luka during the late 1990s and early 2000s from their respective bases in Vienna and Tivat. Since Air Srpska stopped operations, the Government of Republika Srpska has tried to attract new airlines to fly to Banja Luka through various subsidies. Subsidised flights included Jat Airways flights to Belgrade between November 2007 and December 2009, operated with ATR 72, Austrojet flights to Salzburg and Tivat between July and December 2008, operated 3 times a week with Dash 8-100, and Adria Airways flights to Ljubljana between July 2010 and November 2011, operated 4 times a week with CRJ 200. B&H Airlines operated flights to Zürich for many years until airline went out of business in June 2015. BH Airlines operated seasonal charter flights to Tivat in Montenegro.  Passenger numbers more than doubled in 2014, as Air Serbia restarted flights to Belgrade, but suffered in 2015 due to BH Airlines' bankruptcy and the suspension of the Zurich route. Banja Luka airport owner Government of RS subsidises Air Serbia flights to Belgrade. In April 2018, Ryanair announced that it would start its first ever flight from Banja Luka (and Bosnia as a whole) with twice-weekly services to each of Brussels Charleroi and Memmingen, while in May, it added Stockholm Skavsta and, in December, Berlin-Schönefeld to its list of new routes. The flights began in October 2018. Overall, the airline expects 100,000 passengers in 2019. In April 2021, Wizz Air announced its arrival and launch of five routes from Banja Luka to Dortmund, Basel/Mulhouse, Eindhoven, Malmö and Stockholm Skavsta.  Airlines and destinations  The following airlines operate regular flights to and from Banja Luka:  Statistics  Ground transportation The airport was built in the area of Laktaši and Gradiška municipalities, in a wide valley of the Vrbas expanding into Lijevče. It is connected to the new Banja Luka – Gradiška motorway.

Constitution of Uruguay,"The Constitution of Uruguay () is the supreme law of Uruguay. Its first version was written in 1830 and its last amendment was made in 2004.  Uruguay's first constitution was adopted in 1830, following the conclusion of the three-year-long Cisplatine War in which Argentina and Uruguay acted as a federation: the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata. Mediated by the United Kingdom, the 1828 Treaty of Montevideo allowed to build the foundations for a Uruguayan state and constitution. It has been reformed in 1918, 1934, 1942, 1952 and 1967, but it still maintains several articles from its first version of 1830.  Versions  Original Constitution (1830 - 1918)   When it became independent on August 25, 1825, the Oriental Republic of Uruguay (República Oriental del Uruguay) drew up its first constitution, which was promulgated on July 18, 1830. This text has been regarded as Uruguay's most technically perfect charter. Heavily influenced by the thinking of the French and American revolutions, it divided the government among the executive, legislative, and judicial powers and established Uruguay as a unitary republic with a centralized form of government. The bicameral General Assembly (Asamblea General) was empowered to elect a president with considerable powers to head the executive branch for a four-year term. The president was given control over all of his ministers of government and was empowered to make decisions with the agreement of at least one of the three ministers recognized by the 1830 constitution.  Like all of Uruguay's charters since then, the 1830 constitution provided for a General Assembly composed of a Chamber of Senators (Cámara de Senadores), or Senate (Senado), elected nationally, and a Chamber of Representatives (Cámara de Representantes), elected from the departments. Members of the General Assembly were empowered to pass laws but lacked the authority to dismiss the president or his ministers or to issue votes of no confidence. An 1834 amendment, however, provided for juicio político, or impeachment, of the ministers for ""unacceptable conduct"".  As established by the 1830 constitution, the Supreme Court of Justice (Suprema Corte de Justicia), and lesser courts, exercised the judicial power. The General Assembly appointed the members of the high court. The latter – with the consent of the Senate in the case of the appellate courts – appointed the members of the lesser courts. The constitution also divided the country into departments, each headed by a governor appointed by the president and each having an advisory body called a Neighbors' Council (Consejo de Vecinos).  Although the 1830 constitution remained in effect for eighty-seven years, de facto governments violated it repeatedly. In the 1878-90 period, the Blancos and Colorados initiated the framework for a more stable system through understandings called ""pacts between the parties."" This governing principle, called coparticipation (coparticipación), meaning the sharing of formal political and informal bureaucratic power, has been formally practiced since 1872.  The anniversary of the 1830 promulgation of this original constitution on July 18 is now a public holiday in Uruguay.  Second Constitution (1918 - 1934)   In 1913 President José Batlle y Ordóñez (1903–07, 1911–15), the father of modern Uruguay, proposed a constitutional reform involving the creation of a Swiss-style collegial executive system to be called the colegiado. A strong opponent of the one-person, powerful presidency, Batlle y Ordóñez believed that a collective executive power would neutralize the dictatorial intentions of political leaders. It met intense opposition, however, not only from the Blancos but also from members of his own Colorado Party. The proposal was defeated in 1916, but Batlle y Ordóñez worked out a deal with a faction of the Blancos whereby a compromise system was provided for in the second constitution, which was approved by a plebiscite on 25 November 1917.  The history of successive constitutions is one of a lengthy struggle between advocates of the collegial system and those of the presidential system. Although the 1917 constitution worked well during the prosperous time after World War I, recurring conflicts between the president and the colegiado members made the executive power ineffective in coping with the economic and social crises wracking the country. These conflicts eventually led to the presidential coup of 1933. The ad hoc government suspended the constitution and appointed a constituent assembly to draw up a new one.  Third Constitution (1934 - 1942)   The 1934 constitution abolished the colegiado and transferred its power to the president. Nevertheless, presidential powers remained somewhat limited. The executive power once again was exercised by a president who had to make decisions together with the ministers. The 1934 charter established the Council of Ministers (Consejo de Ministros) as the body in which these decisions were to be made. This council consisted of the president and the cabinet ministers. The constitution required the chief executive to appoint three of the nine cabinet ministers from among the members of the political party that received the second largest number of votes in the presidential election. The General Assembly, for its part, could issue votes of no confidence in cabinet ministers, with the approval of two-thirds of its members.  The constitution divided the Senate between the Blancos and the Colorados or, as political scientist Martin Weinstein has pointed out, between the Herrerist faction of the Blancos (named after Luis Alberto de Herrera) and the Terrist wing of the Colorados (named after Gabriel Terra; president, 1931–38). The party that garnered the second largest number of votes automatically received 50 percent of the Senate seats. In addition, the 1934 charter empowered the Supreme Court of Justice to rule on the constitutionality of the laws. This system, which lasted eighteen years, further limited the power of the president and his government.  Fourth Constitution (1942 - 1951)   Uruguay returned to a more democratic system in 1942.  Fifth Constitution (1951 - 1967)   On 13 July 1951, a formal pact between a fraction of the Colorados and the Herrerist Movement of the Blancos called for a plebiscite on constitutional reform. The plebiscite the following December 16 drew less than half of the 1.1 million voters to the polls, but the collegial system was approved by a small margin.  A fourth constitution was promulgated on 25 January 1952 as the culmination of an effort to reestablish the colegiado and the plural executive power, the National Council of Government (Consejo Nacional de Gobierno), with six majority-party seats and three minority-party seats. This nine-member colegiado was ineffective because the president lacked control over the ministers and because the majority was seldom united. In the end, the ineffectiveness of these governments caused the public to turn against the colegiado arrangement.  Sixth Constitution (1967 - 1997)   In the elections of 27 November 1966, nearly 59 percent of Uruguayans voted to amend the 1952 constitution and to reestablish a presidential system of government, thus ending a fifteen-year experiment with the colegiado. The new constitution, which became operative on 15 February 1967, and has remained in effect since then, created a strong one-person presidency, subject to legislative and judicial checks. In free and fair elections, Uruguayans approved the new charter and elected the Colorado Party to power again.  Dictatorial period (1973-1985)  In 1976, however, the military government issued a series of constitutional decrees that amended the 1967 constitution by creating the Council of the Nation (Consejo de la Nación) to serve as the supreme governmental body, with executive and legislative functions. It consisted of the thirty members of the Council of State (Consejo de Estado), the body created by the regime in June 1973 to act in lieu of the General Assembly, which was dissolved by the regime and the twenty-eight senior officers of the armed forces (sixteen from the army, six from the navy, and six from the air force). The Council of the Nation appointed the president of the republic and the members of the Council of State, the Supreme Court of Justice, and the Tribunal of Administrative Claims, which was later dissolved in 1985. Eight institutional acts substituted for many of the functional provisions and guarantees of the 1967 constitution. For example, in addition to giving the Council of the Nation the power to appoint the president of the republic and to set general policy for the country, institutional acts deprived previous officeholders and candidates of their political rights and permitted the arbitrary dismissal of public employees.  Back to institutionality  In 1985, Julio María Sanguinetti was sworn in as the new democratically elected president, after 12 years of dictatorship. The military question was tough to address; after much political bargaining, at the end of December was passed the Expiry Law, which constituted an amnesty of sorts for military people who had committed human-rights abuses. The constitutionality of this law was challenged, but ultimately the citizens backed the law in a plebiscite held in April 1989.  Current (1997 - present)   The 1967 Constitution is still in effect, though it was amended in 1989, 1994, 1996, and 2004. Though some consider the amendments of 1996 to have created a new constitution, Parliament continues to consider them changes to the Constitution of 1967.  The most important concepts that changed in 1996 were those related to elections. From 1999 onwards, the election cycle starts in June, with primary elections for all the parties, in order to choose single presidential candidates; in October, general elections are held, if no presidential candidate scores an absolute majority, a second round of voting is held in November; and finally, in May of the following year, municipal elections are held in all the Departments.

European Bridge League,"The European Bridge League is a confederation of National Bridge Federations (NBFs) that organize the card game of contract bridge in European nations. In turn the EBL organizes bridge competition at the European level. It is a member of the European Olympic Committee and of the World Bridge Federation, where it constitutes one of eight ""Zones"" in world bridge.  Beside the administration of bridge competition (European level and European participation at the world level), the EBL provides online services for players, such as a calendar of tournaments across Europe, a list of bridge books with some reviews, and a record of major achievements by players.  The European Bridge League was established in 1947 by eight NBFs meeting in Denmark. It is incorporated in Switzerland with headquarters in Lausanne, administrative center and secretariat in Milan, Italy. From June 2010 the EBL President is Yves Aubry.  European bridge players are members of the national federations.  there are 49 EBL member countries (NBFs) with nearly 400,000 member players. In turn that is nearly 40% of the countries and 60% of the players under the auspices of the World Bridge Federation.  Contestants from EBL member countries have achieved great success at the world level. They won 22 of 27 medals in bridge at the first World Mind Sports Games, 2008 in Beijing. There were six EBL members in the field of 22 for the last national teams world championship, the 2009 Bermuda Bowl, and all six advanced to the 8-team knockout stage.  Members European Bridge League members are National Bridge Federations and registered European bridge players are members of their national federations.  there are 49 EBL member countries (NBFs) with nearly 400,000 member players. In turn the Europeans are nearly 40% of the countries and 60% of the players under the auspices of the World Bridge Federation.  Geographically the EBL members range from Iceland to Malta to Israel to Armenia, who are all members of the European Olympic Committee too. Both ""bridge Europe"" and ""Olympic Europe"" have 49 members but only 44 match. England, Scotland, and Wales compete as three nations in bridge, Denmark and Faroe Islands compete as two, but they jointly constitute Great Britain and Denmark Olympic teams. Otherwise Andorra, Azerbaijan, Macedonia, and Moldova are in Olympic Europe but do not compete in world bridge. Lebanon is in bridge Europe and Olympic Asia.  The European ""Small Federations"" competition, established 2007, is restricted to national teams from federations with no more than 500 members. Twelve to sixteen teams have participated in the first three renditions. Nineteen of the 49 EBL nations appear to be eligible.  At the other extreme, France and Netherlands account for half of the 384,000 players. Five other nations constitute another 30%: Italy, Germany, England, Denmark, and Sweden. Thus the seven largest bridge nations have 80% of Europe's registered bridge players.  Forty of the 49 EBL nations entered at least one national team in the latest European Team Championships (2010): 38 in the Open category, 28 Women, and 23 Senior teams.  Championships  Perhaps the primary EBL responsibility is to conduct those championships which accord the title European champion.  National teams  The marquee championships for national teams are now biennial in even years. The 2012 rendition was officially the 51st, which recognizes some that predate the EBL.  The European Bridge League (est. 1947) has conducted the event from 1948 when competition was resumed after World War II. Previously and first in 1932 it was organized by the International Bridge League, predecessor of the World Bridge Federation (est. 1958).  The Open flight was first contested in 1932, the Women in 1935, and the Senior in 1995.  Other  The European Open Bridge Championships are biennial in odd years since 2003.  The European Champions' Cup annually since 2002.  The EBL organizes youth events annually in July, for youth teams and pairs that represent EBL member countries.  The European Small Federations Trophy is contested by teams representing bridge nations with up to 500 members.  Controversy  In the 2021 European championships, Italy included Fulvio Fantoni on its team, a player previously sanctioned for cheating. In protest, the remaining national teams refused to play against the Italians and subsequently forfeited their games.  Several national bridge associations indicated support for the forfeitures. The Italian Bridge Federation vigorously protested the actions of the forfeiting players and their National Bridge Organizations (NBO) urging that the European Bridge League expel them from the tournament.

Nevadaplano,"Nevadaplano was a high plateau that covered parts of southwestern North America during the late Mesozoic and early Cenozoic, located in the present-day US states of Idaho, Nevada, Utah and possibly others. It most likely formed during the Cretaceous as a consequence of subduction dynamics and may have reached elevations of  and more. It was flanked on the west by the Sierra Nevada, which was traversed by various valleys that came down from the Nevadaplano. Closed basins and numerous volcanic calderas covered the relatively flat Nevadaplano; large volcanic eruptions distributed ignimbrites over the plateau and down the valleys draining it.  During the Miocene, changes in the tectonic regime caused a collapse and dismemberment of the Nevadaplano. Tectonic extension gave rise to the Basin and Range province and separated the Sierra Nevada-Great Valley block from the Nevadaplano, forming today's landscape.  Research history   The existence of the Nevadaplano was proposed in 2004 by DeCelles and named after the Altiplano high plateau of South America. It is also known as the ""Great Basin Altiplano"". Unlike the present-day Andean Altiplano and Tibetan plateau, the Nevadaplano was dismembered during the Cenozoic and thus its structure and evolution are poorly understood.  Geologic history   The Nevadaplano probably formed as part of either the Sevier or the Laramide Orogeny during the Mesozoic and persisted into the Paleogene. Its growth began either in the Cretaceous or the Jurassic, when significant tectonic shortening took place behind the Sevier orogen. Similar to the present-day Altiplano in South America, the combination of an arid climate, tectonic contraction, weak erosion and the accumulation of volcanic rocks both in and below the crust helped raise the Nevadaplano during the Cretaceous, when flat subduction was taking place. Later its southern part was probably overprinted by the Laramide Orogeny when volcanism shifted far to the east. The exact geologic evolution of the Nevadaplano is controversial, however.  The Nevadaplano underwent extensional tectonics during the Cenozoic in a multi-step process. One stage occurred in the Eocene-Oligocene towards the end of subduction, when subduction steepened again and slab rollback decreased the tectonic forces. It is possible that at that time volcanic activity swept southwestward, away from the volcanoes of central Nevada to the Sierra. This was accompanied by uplift that may have peaked at the arrival of the Yellowstone hotspot.  The plateau overrode the heat source of the East Pacific Rise about 28 million years ago. After a delay, east–west extension and northwestward shearing set in with major extension underway by 16-17 million years ago. The heat flow from the Yellowstone hotspot facilitated the collapse process. Only during the Miocene did the surface of the high plateau to significantly lose elevation. During the Miocene the Sierra Nevada-Great Valley block separated from the Nevadaplano and was tilted to the west along the Sierra Escarpment, beheading a number of westward-going drainages in the process. Former drainages of the Nevadaplano were buried by volcanic rocks and disrupted by tectonic processes. Farther east, the dismemberment of the drainages may have created suitable environments for the evolution of sucker fish. Another stage in the Neogene is the well-known Basin and Range extension, triggered by changes in the plate boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate. Presently, relic surfaces around the Middle Fork Feather River valley and the high elevations of the northern Basin and Range may be considered remnants of the Nevadaplano.  The Nevadaplano during its existence   The Nevadaplano was located in present-day Nevada and Utah, at the location of the present-day Great Basin, and may have extended from what is present-day central Idaho in the north either to Sonora or southern Nevada in the south. It was a high plateau consisting of a peneplain and reached a width of . Isotope analysis indicates that the Nevadaplano stood at high elevations, probably higher than or comparable to the then-Sierra Nevada. The elevation of the Nevadaplano exceeded , but the exact value is controversial. It was not entirely flat, and there is evidence of basins at its western margin although the relief of the Nevadaplano was probably smaller than that of the Altiplano.  The eastern Nevadaplano probably drained to internal basins such as the Uinta Basin, the Western Interior Seaway and westward to the Pacific Ocean. A drainage divide extended from the Mogollon Highlands in the south through the Kingman Uplift into the Nevadaplano. There is some uncertainty in the drainage directions across the Nevadaplano, with some evidence interpreted as indicating that drainage divides shifted over time and that the divide between Nevada and Idaho was offset along a Neoproterozoic lineament. Among the reconstructed drainages are the Tyee and Princeton Rivers from what is present-day north-central Idaho to present-day Oregon and northern California, the Idaho River also from present-day north-central Idaho to the Green River basin and the California River from present-day southernmost California to the Uinta Basin. The northernmost among these rivers may have formed the northern boundary of the Nevadaplano. Some closed drainages also existed, such as in the Elko basin, which formed in response to tectonic deformation.  Some normal faulting took place within the Nevadaplano, along with the exposure of core complexes, and generated isolated basins. This may have created regional basins in the late Cretaceous similar to those that lie in the present-day Altiplano-Puna region, and which include the Sheep Pass Formation basin and the long-lived Elko Basin. Lake sediments and volcanic rocks accumulated in these basins. The formation of these basins may have been an early stage of the collapse of the Nevadaplano.  Geographical and geological boundaries   West of the Nevadaplano stood the Sierra Nevada, which was volcanically active until 80 million years ago and featured exposed batholiths from former volcanism. Its exact elevation at the time is unclear, with alternate models proposing either that it had already reached a height similar to today's Sierra Nevada or that it rose to present-day height in the Miocene and Pliocene. Alternatively, the Luning-Fencemaker fold-and-thrust belt may have formed the western boundary.  It probably did not constitute a drainage divide; various east–west trending valleys cut across the Sierra Nevada at that time. Presently filled with volcanic and sedimentary rocks, these valleys were  wide,  deep with flat and deeply weathered bottoms. Among these valleys are the Nine Hill and Soda Springs valleys in the Lake Tahoe region and the Stanislaus, Mokelumne and Cataract paleochannels in the Sonora Pass region. There is more evidence for paleovalleys in the northern Sierra Nevada than in the southern, which may either indicate that evidence of cross-Sierra drainage was removed in its southern sector or that the southern Sierra was higher than the central and northern Sierra at the time of the Nevadaplano. Some of these rivers may have been large enough to allow sharks to reach Nevada. The rivers flowing through these valleys deposited the placer gold deposits of California, as part of intense westward sediment transport.  Remnants of the Laramide uplands, the Chusca erg or the Sevier fold-and-thrust belt were located east of the Nevadaplano. The boundary was located at a region corresponding to the present-day Wasatch, Santaquin and Canyon Ranges. A relatively short distance may have separated it there from the Western Interior Seaway. The region of what today is northern Nevada during the Oligocene may have been a gently tilted or closed plateau. To the south, the California River may have separated the Nevadaplano from an analogous high plateau to the south, called ""Mexicoplano"" or ""Arizonaplano"". The Colorado Plateau was either to the east of the Nevadaplano or else formed an integral part of the plateau.  Geology   During the Miocene, volcanic activity covered the Nevadaplano with lahars, lava flows and volcanic sediments. In central Nevada and western Utah, at least 71 calderas located at high elevation erupted ignimbrites which propagated for over  westward and across former valleys in the Sierra Nevada, filling them in during the process. In particular, the 28.9 million year old Campbell Creek tuff covered an area of  and propagated far east and west of its source area.  The underlying crust had a sialic composition and reached thicknesses of . It consisted of metamorphic rocks and may have contained core complexes like these currently exposed in the Pequop Mountains of Nevada, as well as batholiths like the Idaho Batholith.  Ecosystems and climate   Based on the fossils found in the Sheep Pass Formation, the Nevadaplano likely had a cold high-elevation climate. Located in the rain shadow of the Sierra Nevada, it was dry, and therefore experienced only weak erosion. The rain shadow extended east of the Nevadaplano. However, precipitation was enough to cut large valleys into the Sierra Nevada, perhaps aided by the then-warm climate. Pulses of erosion may have occurred during Paleogene climate disturbances, such as the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum. Vegetation with temperate climate affinities may have migrated from the Nevadaplano to California when the climate cooled during the Oligocene, founding the temperate forest communities of California.  Evidence suggests that lakes and alluvial fans existed on the Nevadaplano, the Sheep Pass Formation constitutes the remnants of such landforms. It is not clear however if the Sheep Pass lake system was at high elevation. Fossils of anurans, birds, bivalves, crustaceans, frogs, lizards, mammals, molluscs, ostracods and snakes have been found there, as well as evidence of algae, charophytes, plants and microbial mats. There are also traces of physical events such as debris flows, periodic desiccation and storms. Lakes formed during the disassembly of the Nevadaplano as well, including these where the Truckee Formation diatomites were emplaced in.

Lene Voigt,"Lene Voigt (born Helene Wagner: 2 May 1891 - 16 June 1962) was a German writer and poet.   Although some of her earlier work employed standard ""Hochdeutsch"" German, she is better remembered today for her poetry and prose texts written in the Saxon dialect.  After 1945 her home city of Leipzig found itself in what became, in 1949, the German Democratic Republic (East Germany).   For various reasons Voigt's work disappeared from the shelves during the National Socialist years: her hopes that it would return to the magazines and bookshops after 1945 were dashed.   It is widely thought that this was, at least in part, because her Saxon dialect writing was seen in some quarters as disrespectful.   Walter Ulbricht, the national leader between 1949 and 1971, also came from Leipzig, which meant that the dialect and accent of Saxony were the dialect and accent of the leader.   In West Germany, across the internal border, her work was again published during the 1950s, and after Walter Ulbricht left the stage it also experienced a revival in East Germany, where a particularly effective cheer leader was (and post-reunification remains) the cabaret artiste and impresario Gisela Oechelhaeuser.  Life  Provenance Helene ""Lene"" Alma Wagner was born at her grandmother's home in Leipzig.   The circumstances of her birth may have contributed to subsequent confusion as to its precise date.   Her mother had already given birth in 1887 and again in 1888, but the first son had been born dead and the second died after three hours.   The understandable anxiety accompanying Helene's birth meant that she was subjected to an ""emergency baptism"" on the day she was born.   Her godparents were her mother's sister and grandmother along with a theology student who may also have been a maternal relative.   The doctors gave the parents little reason to hope that their baby daughter might survive, but survive she did.  Her parents had married in Leipzig in 1887.   Her mother, born Alma Maria Pleißner (1860-1924), came from an academic family.   She always spoke standard ""Hochdeutsch"" German and was uncompromising in her insistence that Lene should do the same.   Lene inherited something of her mother's critical approach to life.   While her husband was alive Alma Maria Wagner stayed at home and looked after the little family.   Later she was employed as a housekeeper.   By the time she died she was living in a ""poor house"" (""Armenstift"").   Lene's father, Karl Bruno Wagner (1873-1917), worked as a typesetter. Lene later wrote that he came from a ""family of mountain peasants"" (""Gebirgsbauerngeschlecht"").   From her father Lene inherited a talent for humour.   He liked to use the local dialect.   Sources indicate that Lene probably also inherited from her father a tendency to suffer with Depression and Psychoses. Karl Wagner drowned in 1917 when he was just 54.  Childhood She grew up in Leipzig.   The family moved house several times while she was still small.   Lene Wagner was a wild child and something of a prankster.   For six years she attended school locally: she excelled academically, especially in lessons on Religion. Then, at her mother's wish, between 1905 and 1910 she attended a training establishment for Kindergarten work.   Her interests lay in another direction, however.   By the time she was 15 she had started to write poetry.   In the end she undertook an apprenticeship for work in the book trade.   Her childhood seems to have involved the omnipresence of relatives: aunts, in particular, were always in the background. The family was evidently a close-knit one.   She loved to read, later naming the Viennese novelist-poet Ludwig Anzengruber as the favourite author of her childhood years.   It was presumably from Anzengruber that she learned to identify social and political issues, and how to present them with humour.   After she grew up Lene Voigt also recalled a period of her childhood when she was sent away to live with a church minister in a small mining village in the Erzgebirgischer mountain region, near the border with Bohemia and to the south of Leipzig.   Precisely when, where and why she was sent to the mountains is unclear, but the arrangement was, in any case, temporary.  Employment As was usual in working-class families at the time, Lene's childhood was all too brief.   According to several sources she left her parents' home as soon as she could.   She was only 12 when she took work as a courier for a dolls' clinic, collecting dolls in need of attention and returning them to their homes following repair.   This involved a very small girl walking the streets of Leipzig with an implausibly large basket.   She was later able to recall the image and joke about it, but the work itself was perfectly serious.   After she had been persuaded by her mother to enroll at an academy for Kindergarten work, between 1903 and approximately 1905 she worked as a nanny for a prosperous family.   As part of the work, she used to create puppetry games to keep the children amused.   It was the ""background humour"" incorporated in one of these puppetry games that led to her dismissal.  There followed a succession of jobs in Leipzig. At one stage she took an office job with the Teubner publishing business, and in 1912 she joined the Köhler Book wholesale traders ("" Barsortiment Köhler"").  Family tragedy After at least two ""disappointing relationships with men"", on 19 or 24 September Helene Wagner married Friedrich Otto Voigt.   He was an orchestral musician who played in the Paul Lincke Orchestra, and the marriage took place in the St. Thomas Church.   Unfortunately war had broken out at the end of July, and after the marriage ceremony Voigt was almost immediately conscripted into the army.   He returned from the war alive but missing an arm, which put an end to his musical career.   Between 1917 and the end of February 1919 Lene Voigt was employed as a sales representative by Insel Verlag (publishers): her departure was greatly regretted by Anton Kippenberg, the head of the business.   The birth of her son, Alfred on 10 September 1919 provides a clue as to the reason for her resignation from Insel.   The marriage ended in divorce in 1920.   Nevertheless, Lene remained in touch with Voigt, and later on good terms with his second family, for the rest of her life.  By 1923 Lene Voigt was working for the foreign trade subsidiary of ""Barsortiment Köhler"", which collapsed in August of that year. This turned out to have been her last experience of full-time employment.   She now became a ""Geistesarbeiterin"" which was a contemporary euphemism for self-employment.  Bereavements Living alone and without permanent work, Lene Voigt faced a compounding tragedy on 6 February 1924 when Alfed died from Tubercular Meningitis.   He was not quite five.   She tried to work through her grief by writing.  Happiness of a kind returned at some point between 1926 1928 when she teamed up with Karl Geil, an unemployed anarchist and opera singer.   He described Voigt as the one great love of his life.   Geil was married to someone else, but lived apart from his wife.   He was a member of a progressive movement known as the ""Vagabond Brotherhood"" which involved a rather itinerant lifestyle.   For a year or so from 1928 the meetings between Geil and Vogt became progressively less frequent, although they maintained an intensely passionate relationship by letter.   In January 1929 Voigt's worst fears were confirmed: Karl Geil was more seriously sick than he could admit to himself.   He collapsed unexpectedly on a street in Dresden and was taken to hospital where on 19 January 1929 he died as the result of a stroke.   It took considerable effort for Voigt to have his ashes returned from Dresden to Leipzig.   The deaths within a few years first of her child and then of her lover plunged her into severe  depression which would haunt her for the rest of her life.  Friends advised a new start.   Later in 1929 Voigt moved to the northern port city of Bremen, an industrial hub with a seething political and cultural energy.   She arrived with little more than a typewriter and a small suitcase.   The next few years were some of her most productive. Some of her best known books date from this period.   She also benefited from frequent visits from Robert Meier, an admirer twelve years her junior who became a lifelong friend.   Many of her texts, including some that never found a publisher, have survived only because she sent copies to Meier, and Meier took good care of them.  Success followed by dictatorship Until the Hitler government took power Lene Voigt now enjoyed a hitherto unfamiliar level of financial security.   The rapid transition to one-party dictatorship during 1933 changed that.   Even after 1933 her books failed to follow the official orthodoxies.   Her humour was not to the liking of the authorities.   She became an object of government suspicion and a target for Gestapo surveillance.   She herself became increasingly unsettled, relocating to Lübeck in 1934 and to Flensburg in 1935.   For a long time she lived only in rented furnished apartments.  ""Nicht sächsisch, sondern jiddisch"" One respect in which the Hitler government was keen for Germany to catch up with Britain and France involved centralsing state power.   Government strategy extended well beyond replacing Germany's former administrative structure. In Saxony Martin Mutschmann, the regional governor (""Gauleiter"") established the ""Heimatwerk Sachsen – Verein zur Förderung des sächsischen Volkstums e. V."" (loosely, ""...association for promoting Saxon popular culture and identity"") in 1936.   The idea was to take control of all regional cultural aspirations and redirect them in support of party goals. The ""Heimatwerk Sachsen"" existed till 1945, intended to inspire the entire region of Saxony to identify with the National Socialist state.    As part of this mission, the ""Heimatwerk Sachsen"" banned the Saxon dialect. There was no longer any place for ""Saxon comedy, joke makers and jewifying literati"" , which had simply led to ""mutilation of the language in Saxony"" (""Verschandelung der sächsischen Sprache"").   Lene Voigt was expressly identified as part of the problem.   Saxon-dialect literature was ""unheroic"": it was almost all pulped.  The Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda placed a nationwide ban on further publication of Voigt's books.   The security services were only too well aware that she not only wrote texts using Saxon dialect, but that before 1933 she had also worked with politically left-leaning publications and that she had openly asserted her atheism.   Voigt did not react robustly to the increasingly threatening situation in which she now found herself.   Intensified surveillance, proscription, the publishing ban and the resulting economic hardship led her to a form of psychosis.   Between 18 May and 15 June 1936 she was placed in a mental hospital in Schleswig for the treatment of mental instability and hallucinations.   When she was released it was ""without mental disorder"".   She herself diagnosed her illness as stemming from delusions of persecution.   That may have been necessary to secure her release, but at least one commentator has questioned her use of the word ""delusion"" in this context.  It is not known why Lene Voigt relocated to Munich in 1937, but her reasons for leaving the city are apparent: the newspaper of the local Nazi paramilitaries (SA) launched a press campaign against her, ostensibly in connection with a Saxon-dialect card-game.   In or before 1938 she relocated to Hamburg and then to Berlin where she lived till 1940.  In 1934 Lene Voigt had acquired a second home in Leipzig, and she had held on to it during the ensuing six years.   In 1940 she was therefore able to return to the city of her birth.   War had returned to central Europe at the end of the previous summer, and she was now conscripted for a form of national service obligation (""Dienstverpflichtung""). That involved working for the Giesecke+Devrient specialist printing company which at that time had its main business in Leipzig.   Later she was sent to work as an invoicing clerk with Lange & Meuche Verlag, which was part of the Rothbarth publishing conglomerate. She also spent time as an in-patient at Leipzig University Mental Clinic during 1940.   More precise details of how, why and when are not available due to the subsequent wartime destruction of her medical records.  Soviet occupation zone The U.S. 2nd Infantry Division and U.S. 69th Infantry Division reached Leipzig in April 1945 and completed its capture after ""fierce urban action"".   By this time, however. President Roosevelt, Prime Minister Churchill and Marshal Stalin had already agreed a postwar military settlement for the western two thirds of Germany which would divide the territory into four separate occupation zones.   Under the agreement Leipzig was to be administered as part of the Soviet occupation zone.   Accordingly, in July 1945 the United States army withdrew from the city and Soviet forces moved in.   By this time both the publishing firms who had published Voigt's work before the National Socialists had banned it had moved what remained of their businesses from Leipzig to Munich, which had ended up under American military occupation.  With the twelve year National Socialist period at an end, Lene Voigt might hope for better times ahead, and indeed her texts were included in ""Die Rampe"", Leipzig's first postwar cabaret show.   Sadly, there would be no large-scale return to the popular mainstream, however.   She overworked herself, worried about the future, and forgot to eat enough, at one stage weighing just .   She was also suffering with climacteric issues.   Reports of hallucinations and signs of mental instability led to a diagnosis (subsequently corrected) of ""Schizophrenic episodes"" and re-admission to the University Mental Clinic on 11 June 1946.    She remained there for fourteen days and was probably subjected to the conventional remedies of the time: Electroconvulsive therapy, Barbiturates and physical restraints (""Netzbehandlung"").   The University Mental Clinic into which she was admitted in 1946 was not the one in which she had been treated in 1940, however.   That had been destroyed by an air attack in 1943: provision had been rehoused.   In 1945 there were 200 beds available for psychiatry and neurology treatment which was completely inadequate.   In the summer of 1946, when Lene Voigt was admitted, 25 cases were being refused admission every day.   Inside the Soviet occupation zone hospitals were experiencing food shortages and shortages of heating fuel that were in many cases measurably worse than during the war years.   Many of the doctors, nurses and other specialists still had not returned from the war, while others who were in Leipzig were still unable to work, pending denazification processing.   Due to the shortage of capacity at the University Clinic Voigt was transferred, on 26 June 1946, to the Saxony-Altscherbitz District Hospital (""Landesheilanstalt Altscherbitz""): gradually her condition improved and she returned to her writing.   She was discharged on 24 February 1947.   She was lucky.   The Saxony-Altscherbitz District Hospital was a specialist establishment for psychiatric and nervous disorders which even by the standards of the time and place had a terrible record. A later study determined that during 1947 887 patients accommodated in the institution - equivalent to 38% of all patients - died as a result of deficiencies in the care provided (""aufgrund der Mangelversorgung"").  One of the poems Voigt wrote shortly before her discharge in February 1947 was entitled ""Wir 'armen Irren'"" (loosely, ""We, 'poor lunatics'""). Coming across this work prompted Dietfried Müller-Hegemann (1910-1989), one of the hospital physicians who had overseen her treatment, to investigate Voigt's case further and to correct the ""Schizophrenic episodes"" diagnosis which had led to her hospitalisation the previous June.   It was now determined that in response to the exceptionally burdensome life events to which she had been subjected, she had become ill with repeating ""Reactive Psychosis"" (wiederholt ""Reaktive Psychose"").   In 1966, after he had retired from the hospital (and after Lene Voigt herself had died), Müller-Hegemann published a ""Textbook for psychiatry and neurology"" in which he wrote up the case in some detail.   Although he did not name his patient, he did include sufficient details to identify her beyond all reasonable doubt.   As a result, among several generations of students and practitioners of Psychiatric Medicine Lene Voigt became as well known (or better known) as the subject of a celebrated case study as she was as a published author and poet of German-language and Saxon dialect texts.  Between 1947 and 1949 Lene Voigt worked in the Food Ration Cards department for the Leipzig region.   Little is known of her life circumstances during this time.  Institutionalised On 6 July 1949 Voigt was admitted into the Leipzig-Dosen District Psychiatric Clinic.   Notes made at the time of her admission suggest manic aspects to her behaviour.   She ""danced waltzes in front of the admitting physician and reportedly hallucinated and gave out paranoid utterances"".  By August 1949 the acute phase of her condition had subsided, but she expressed reluctance to leave the hospital because she thought she might be unable to manage with life's daily demands if she were to go back to living on her own.   Instead the hospital administrators employed her as a live-in document courier.   The hospital's ""pavilion-based"" layout ensured a continuing need for documents to be delivered from one building to another.   This provided her with the necessary measure of security.   She began to make regular visit to the city centre and she also resumed her writing.   Hospital administrators from that time would remember her as an exceptionally well read woman with an intense interest in current events and a strong willingness to engage in conversation.   She was generous in giving away her own written pieces, which by this time were frequently handwritten.  Lene Voigt lived at the hospital in Leipzig-Dosen for thirteen years.   She was regarded as a reliable employee. The only wish she expressed consistently was that she might end her days at the Fritz Austel Retirement Home. The hospital management backed her in this.   However, on 16 July 1962 she died in the hospital wing of the District Psychiatric Clinic. Her death was almost entirely overlooked at the time when it happened, apart from a two line announcement in the local newspaper.   It was only in 1985 that a gravestone was placed over her grave, and only in 2002 that her remains were disinterred and reburied with other distinguished citizens in the ""Artists' Section"" (""Künstlerabteilung"") of the Leipzig Südfriedhof (South Cemetery).  Works Lene Wagner was fifteen when, in 1906, her first published contribution, a ""gymnastics society humoresque"", was published in ""Der Leipziger"".   In 1913 she became a regular contributor to the ""Leipziger Hausfrau"" newspaper, and in 1914, for the first time, her work was included in a book.   The book was an anthology entitled ""Dichtung und Prosa von Leipziger Frauen"" (""Poetry and Prose by Leipzig Women"").  Over the next few years she continued to contribute regularly both to ""Der Leipziger"" and to ""Leipziger Hausfrau"": her pieces were generally in the entertainment genre, and often used the Saxon dialect.   In 1920 she receives her first mention in the Kürschners Deutscher Literatur-Kalender: her entry in the biennial biographical directory (of German writers) mentions her membership of the ASV (national writers' association) and describes her as an author of sketches, satires and Saxon dialect poetry. What she wrote was not merely entertaining, nor even just satirical-political: Voigt made no secret of her sympathy for the recently formed Communist Party (though there are no indications that she ever became a party member).   She contributed pieces to ""Die Rote Fahne"" (""... Red Flag), the party newspaper.   From 1921 she also wrote for ""Der Drache"" (""... Dragon""), a satirical magazine, and for the ""Sächsische Arbeiterzeitung"" (""... Workers' Newspaper"").   Between 1923 and 1926 she was also writing for the ""Proletarische Heimstunden"", a short-lived anti-militarist magazine, her work displaying a style of casual inconsequential humorous journalism that rapidly disappeared after 1933 and has never really returned.  More recent studies of Lene Voigt tend to focus only on her better known works:  Saxon dialect variants of ballads and other literary classics.   These are not simply ""translations"" into Saxon.   The well calibrated humour of the author endows them, frequently, with a less heroic and a more human tone than the German-language original versions.  Lene Voigt's reputation was at its height between the middle 1920s and the early 1930s.   She worked for a number of newspapers and magazines in Saxony, but her much work could be read across Germany and indeed in German language newspapers further afield.   She felt a particular affinity with the magazine ""Der gemütliche Sachse"" (in 1929 renamed ""Der lustige Sachse"") and over time became its principal contributor.   A first Phonograph record#78 rpm disc developments appeared featuring Voigt's anecdites, poems, skits and parodies - not all of them just in dialect.   It proved successful and lucrative.   Books were published, collecting her dialect poems and prose texts together:  ""Säk'sche Balladen"" (1925), ""Säk'sche Glassigger"" (1925), ""Mir Sachen. Lauter gleenes Zeich zum Vortragen"" (2 volumes, 1928), *In Sachsen gewachsen"" (1932), ""Die sächsische Odyssee"" (1933) and ""Leibzcher Lindenblieten"" (1935).   Alongside these dialect works, she also published the autobiographical narrative ""Mally der Familienschreck (1927)"" and a travel novel, ""Vom Pleißestrand nach Helgoland"" (1934) in German before the publication ban came into effect.  Except at the most acute phases of her illness Lene Voigt never stopped writing, even after 1949 when the Soviet occupation zone was relaunched as the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), and she herself moved into the Psychiatric Clinic where she would spend her final thirteen years.   However, during those final years she was no longer paid for any of her writing, because with the country under the direction of the relentlessly unamused (and Saxon) First Secretary Ulbricht, any ""Saxon utterance"" risked being interpreted by the authorities as a form of mockery.   During the Ulbricht years just one Lene Voigt poem - which she had sent to a newspaper as a ""reader's letter"" - was published.   Astonishingly, she was never forgotten by people in Saxony, however.  In West Germany new editions of her compilations ""Balladen"" and ""Glassigger"" did appear in the 1950s, but the author received no money, nor even a copy.   Worse than that, thanks to the Cold war divisions of the time, and the growing impenetrability of the border between the two Germanys, she was not even aware of these new editions of her work.   In East Germany, after Ulbricht died (and so more than ten years after Voigt's own death) her work did reappear in the press during the mid 1970s.   Then, in 1982, a Voigt book appeared in her homeland:  ""Bargarohle, Bärchschaft und sächs'sches Ginsdlrblut"" presented a cross-section of her life's work, including magazine contributions, dialect works and satirical pieces.   A second volume followed in 1984.   As East Germany approached its own time of decisive changes the focus of editors tended increasingly to concentrate on Voigt's more overtly political texts.  In 1978/79 Rowohlt Verlag acquired the publishing rights to ""Balladen"" and ""Glassigger"" which have enjoyed unbroken popularity in West Germany, and since 1990 Germany, ever since.  Revival and the Lene Voigt Society During the 1980s and 1990s, to the extent that she had ever been forgotten, Lene Voigt was rediscovered, especially in the eastern part of Germany.   Wolfgang U. Schütte, in particular, undertook and from 1983 published new research work.   Further information and insights into Voigt's life became available only after 1990.   Since 1990 there has been an emergence of so-called Ostalgie, whereby people express nostaligia for what was good about the German Democratic Republic (1949-1989) without (in most cases) seeking to downplay the political repression and economic failings that led to its collapse.   Part of ""Ostalgie"" has been a booming interest in political cabaret which before totalitarianism was always more celebrated in the central industrial cities such as Berlin and Leipzig than further west.   Three stars and scholars from he world of cabaret in Leipzig who have shown particular commitment to reviving the poetry and lyrics written by Lene Voigt are Bernd-Lutz Lange, Tom Pauls and Gisela Oechelhaeuser.  The Lene Voigt Society (""Lene-Voigt-Gesellschaft"") was founded in 1995 in Leipzig is a particular focus of commitment to discovering more aboud Lene Voigt's life and work.   It has taken responsibility in respect of a number of publications on Voigt including, not leastly, a six volume compilation of her own works.   The non-profit organisation has followed in her tracks and, in particular, worked to identify and draw attention to all the many Leipzig apartments and other homes and institutions in which she lived during a somewhat unsettled life.   As researches are pursued, it often turns out that earlier details of Voigt's life have been incorrectly recorded, and one of the Lene Voigt Society objectives is to promote the publication of a new biography to build on Wolfgang Schütte's 1983 with all the additional information that has come to light - not leastly through Schütte's own efforts - while eliminating those errors that remain in the public arena.

Vulcano,"Vulcano () or Vulcan is a small volcanic island  belonging to Italy in the Tyrrhenian Sea, about  north of Sicily and located at the southernmost end of the seven Aeolian Islands. The island is  in area, rises to  above sea level, and it contains several volcanic calderas, including one of the four active volcanoes in Italy that are not submarine.  The word ""volcano"", and its equivalent in several European languages, derives from the name of this island, which derives from the Roman belief that the tiny island was the chimney of  Vulcan, the Roman god of fire. In November 2021, 150 people were evacuated from the island's harbour area due to increased volcanic activity and gases; an amber alert had been issued in October 2021 after several significant changes in the volcano's parameters.  History   The Romans used the island mainly for raw materials, harvesting timber, and mining alum and sulfur. These were the principal activities on the island until the end of the nineteenth century.  After Bourbon rule collapsed in 1860, the Scottish industrialist and philanthropist James Stevenson bought the northern part of the island. He then built a villa, reopened the local mines, and planted vineyards for making Malmsey wine. Stevenson lived on Vulcano until the last major eruption on the island, in 1888. This eruption lasted the better part of two years, by which time Stevenson had sold all of his property to the local populace. He never returned to the island. His villa is still intact.  Geology  Volcanic activity in the region is largely the result of tectonic activity,  the northward-moving African plate meeting the Eurasian plate. There are three volcanic centres on the island:   At the southern end of the island are old stratovolcano cones, Monte Aria (), Monte Saraceno (), and Monte Luccia (), which have partially collapsed into the Il Piano Caldera.  The most recently active centre is the Gran Cratere at the top of the Fossa cone, the cone having grown in the Lentia Caldera in the middle of the island, and has had at least nine major eruptions in the last 6,000 years.  At the north of the island is the islet, Vulcanello (), connected to Vulcano by an isthmus that may be flooded in bad weather. It emerged from the sea during an eruption in 183 BCE, as a separate islet. Occasional eruptions from its three cones with both pyroclastic flow deposits and lavas occurred from then until 1550, with the last eruption creating a narrow isthmus connecting it to Vulcano.  Vulcano has been quiet since the eruption of the Fossa cone on 2 August 1888 to 22 March 1890, which deposited about  of pyroclastic material on the summit. The style of eruption seen on the Fossa cone is called a Vulcanian eruption, being the explosive emission of pyroclastic fragments of viscous magmas caused by the high viscosity preventing gases from escaping easily. This eruption of Vulcano was carefully documented at the time by Giuseppe Mercalli. Mercalli described the eruptions as ""...explosions sounding like a cannon at irregular intervals..."" As a result, vulcanian eruptions are based on his description. A typical vulcanian eruption can hurl blocks of solid material several hundreds of metres from the vent. Mercalli reported that blocks from the 1888–1890 eruption fell into the sea between Vulcano and neighboring Lipari, and several that had fallen on the island of Vulcano were photographed by him or his assistants.   Volcanic gas emissions from this volcano are measured by a multicomponent gas analyzer system, which detects degassing of rising magmas before an eruption, improving prediction of volcanic activity.  A survey on local groundwater from 1995 to 1997 found temperatures of 49–75 °C, sodium sulfate-chloride chemical composition, and near neutral pH in the water wells closest to the slopes of the volcanic cone. This is mainly due to condensation onto the slopes of the volcanic cone and water-rock interaction buffering.  Population At the 2011 Census, Vulcano had a population of 953 residents, living in three localities – Vulcano Porto, Vulcano Piano and Vulcanello.  Biology Since Vulcano island has volcanic activity, it is a place where thermophiles and hyperthermophiles are likely to be found. In fact, the hyperthermophilic archaean Pyrococcus furiosus was described for the first time when it was isolated from sediments of this island by Gerhard Fiala and Karl Stetter.  Mythology  The Ancient Greeks named this island Therasía (Θηρασία) and Thérmessa (Θέρμεσσα, source of heat). The island appeared in their myths as the private foundry of the Olympian god Hephaestus, the patron of blacksmiths. Their myths noted two more of his foundries, at Etna and Olympus. Strabo also mentions Thermessa as sacred place of Hephaestus (ἱερὰ Ἡφαίστου), but it is not certain whether this was a third name for the island, or merely an adjective.  Similarly, the Romans believed that Vulcano was the chimney of their god Vulcan's workshop and, therefore, named the island after him. According to the Roman myths, the island had grown due to his periodic clearing of cinders and ashes from his forge. They also explained earthquakes that either preceded or accompanied the explosions of ash as being due to Vulcan making weapons for their god Mars for his armies to wage war.  First historical ascent and reception in medieval literature The first ascent of the volcanic cone is documented for the 13th century. The Dominican monk Burchard of Mount Sion, in his pilgrimage report to the Holy Land, tells of his return journey via Sicily, which probably took place in 1284. On Vulcano he had climbed the summit ""crawling on his hands and feet"". His ascent can be considered authentic, as he reports in detail on his observations of the landscape and nature, for example describing the fumaroles or the diameter of the crater.  The island of Vulcano as well as the Aeolian Islands are already known to Isidor of Seville, the Gallic bishop Arculf, who dictated his journey to the Holy Land to the Irishman Adomnan (before 680), or Bartholomew Anglicus. They are an integral part of medieval knowledge of the geography of the Mediterranean, but none of them wrote about Vulcano on their own initiative.  Vulcano is also mentioned in the pilgrimage report (ca. 1350) by Ludolf von Sudheim, who, however, claims that he did not dare to climb it. Unlike Burchard of Mount Sion, Ludolf expected to find the entrance to hell at the crater. The Provençal knight Antoine de La Sale tells of an excursion to the island in 1406. His text is a didactic textbook for his pupil John of Calabria, the son of Duke Rene I of Anjou.  Appearances in contemporary culture The film Vulcano (released in the U.S. as Volcano) was filmed on Vulcano and the nearby island of Salina between 1949 and 1950.  An asteroid is named for this island, 4464 Vulcano.  The island of Vulcano is featured in the Battle Tendency story arc of the manga JoJo's Bizarre Adventure by Hirohiko Araki, as the scene of the final clash between the protagonist Joseph Joestar and the antagonist Kars, leader of the Pillar Men.  The American attorney and writer, Richard Paul Roe, asserts that the play The Tempest by William Shakespeare is set on the island of Vulcano, rather than the more authoritative interpretation that the setting was based on reports about Bermuda in the Americas and a hurricane encountered there.  The island is referred to by a hologram of Leonardo da Vinci in the Star Trek: Voyager episode ""Concerning Flight"" while speaking to Tuvok, an alien from a planet named Vulcan.

"Weed Heights, Nevada","Weed Heights is an unincorporated community in Lyon County, Nevada, USA. It is adjacent to Yerington.  History The Anaconda Copper Company built Weed Heights in 1952, named for Clyde E Weed, vice president in charge of Anaconda operations, to support the Anaconda Mine. A post office was established March 16, 1953. The town was owned by Anaconda until the company was taken over by Atlantic Richfield Company. Atlantic Richfield ceased operations in 1978 and sold the property in 1982 to Don Tibbals, a Lyon County commissioner, who subsequently sold the entire property to Arimetco, with the exception of the town of Weed Heights, which is now a rental community and RV park.

Ephippiger terrestris,"Ephippiger terrestris, common name Alpine saddle-backed bush-cricket,  is a bush cricket species belonging to the family Tettigoniidae, subfamily Bradyporinae.  Subspecies Subspecies include:  Ephippiger terrestris bormansi Brunner von Wattenwyl, 1882 (in Italy and Switzerland)  Ephippiger terrestris caprai Nadig, 1980 (in Italy)  Ephippiger terrestris terrestris Yersin, 1854  Distribution This species is present in Middle and Southwestern Europe (France, Italy and Switzerland). The subspecies E. terrestris bormansi occurs only in northern Italy and southern Switzerland.  Habitat This species occurs in warm mountain meadows and pastures, in open rocks and in dwarf shrubs, at an elevation of  above sea level.  Description  Ephippiger terrestris can reach a body length of about  in males, of about  in females, while ovipositor can reach about .  These bush crickets are usually bluish-green. However, in both sexes the body color is quite variable and often olive-green, beige and sepia-brown color variations occur. A yellowish line runs from the lower edge of the pronotum to the abdomen end. Two bright longitudinal lines run along the back sides.  The back of the head is black. The form of the pronotum is rather smooth and gently concave and resembles a saddle (the Latin name ephippium means 'saddle of a horse'). They have round small atrophied wings, protruding a few millimeters below the pronotum, that are unfit to flight and only used for the emission of sounds (stridulation). In the females the ovipositor is long and slightly curved upwards. In the male cerci stand out clearly and are cylindrical and relatively long.  Biology Adults can be found from July to October. The larvae go through about 5 stages. These bush crickets are omnivorous. Both the male and the female can produce sounds, even if the female does so rarely and only in response to other males.

A Brush with Fame,"A Brush with Fame is a light hearted ITV daytime television show, featuring a nationwide search to find Britain's best amateur portrait painter. It was presented by Carol Smillie, and the last episode was broadcast on 11 November 2005.  Background The programme series was initially piloted by Granada Television using the name Celebrity Face Paint.  Format The series took place in each of nine UK regions involving 900 contestants. One hundred people in each of the regions were given half an hour to produce a self-portrait using materials supplied by the programmers.  Then, while the artists took a break, Carol and the two judges, Christian Furr and David Lee looked at the painted pictures and chose twenty five people to go into the next round and paint a celebrity guest.  The artists could then use their own materials and any medium.  Out of the 25, the judges then chose 10 who would go on to the next round and paint a second celebrity.  Out of the 10, one finalist was selected and also one wild card show contestant who would compete with 8 others from the other regions in a wild card show for the chance to join the nine finalists in London.  Final The final, broadcast in November 2005, challenged the ten finalists to paint a portrait of Coronation Street actor Malcolm Hebden, who was dressed as a clown. The winner received a cheque for £10,000 and also the opportunity to turn professional, with the offer of a deal with leading art publisher, Washington Green.  Axed It was announced by ITV in January 2006, that A Brush With Fame would not return for a second series.

It was released in 2006 and stars Tom Wilkinson as Rockwell, Emily Watson as his wife Lucille, and Evan Rachel Wood as their daughter Jeannie. Rockwell's career began to take off when he met illustrator Charles Marion Russell at art school; they became friends who worked together on several projects before Russell died suddenly from pneumonia while visiting Paris in 1918.  After graduating from art school, Rockwell moved back home where he found work painting portraits commissioned by local families.   He also started working freelance doing illustrations for magazines such as The Saturday Evening Post.    In 1925, after being rejected by other publishers because of his lack of formal training,  Rockwell accepted a job offer from Henry J. Luce III to illustrate the cover of Time magazine which featured President Calvin Coolidge posing with three farm animals.   His first illustration appeared on May 1, 1927, but it wasn't until 1931 that he created what would become one of his most famous works, ""The Problem We All Live With""; this image depicted a young mother holding her crying baby next to a gunman pointing a pistol into its head.     During World War II, Rockwell painted propaganda posters;  these included images depicting soldiers returning home safely or celebrities endorsing war bonds.   When the war ended,   Rockwell returned to creating covers for Time Magazine including those featuring Winston Churchill and Eleanor Roosevelt.   By 1947, he had been appointed Chief Creative Officer of the magazine.   That same year, he married Lucille Stanton whom he'd known since childhood.   They were divorced in 1953 following allegations made against him during a divorce proceeding involving another woman named Doris Day.

Wesley O. Smith,"Wesley Oliver Smith (April 16, 1878October 20, 1951), commonly known as W. O. Smith, was an American newspaper publisher and businessman from southern Oregon.  He owned the Klamath Republican and later the Evening Herald, both Klamath Falls newspapers.  Smith was a Republican who served two two-year terms in the Oregon House of Representatives, representing what are today Crook, Deschutes, Grant, Jefferson, Klamath, and Lake counties.  Early life   Smith was born on April 16, 1878 in French Lake, an unincorporated area of New Brunswick, Canada.  He was the son of George F. Smith and Anna Smith.  His family left Canada and moved to Eau Claire, Wisconsin, when he was eight years old.  In 1895, Governor William H. Upham commissioned Smith as a second lieutenant in the Wisconsin National Guard.  He served in Company E of the Third Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry from the time of his commissioning to August 1897.  Company E was based in Eau Claire.  With the onset of the Spanish–American War, Smith rejoined the Wisconsin National Guard as a non-commissioned officer.  He served as first sergeant for Company E.  After the war, Smith moved to Harrison, Idaho, where he briefly worked cruising timber before moving on to Klamath Falls, Oregon.  Life in Klamath Falls   In Klamath Falls, Smith worked for a short time in the lumber business. Then in 1903, he bought the Klamath Republican from W. Huse and Sons.  The Klamath Republican was a weekly newspaper that had been published in Klamath Falls since 1896.  When he took charge of the paper, Klamath Falls had five newspapers competing for reads in a community of only 3,000 people.  Smith married Jessie Applegate on December 11, 1904.  She was the youngest daughter of Captain Ivan D. Applegate, an early Klamath County pioneer.  Nine months later, she died in Klamath Falls, three days after giving birth to a son.  Smith married his second wife, Lena L. Hargus, on October 24, 1906.  She was the widow of Doctor H. B. Hargus, and was also the sister of Smith’s first wife.  They remained together for the rest of his life.  In 1908, Smith acquired another Klamath Falls newspaper, the Evening Herald (now the Herald and News), from its founder Fred Cronemiller.  After buying the Evening Herald, he purchased and installed a new Linotype machine, the first automated typesetting machine in the Klamath Falls area.  Under his management, the Evening Herald became the area’s leading newspaper.  Smith continued to publish the Klamath Republican along with the Herald.  He eventually changed the Klamath Republican from a weekly to a semi-weekly publication.  In 1914, he merged it in to the Evening Herald as a semi-weekly supplement.  Smith also started a printing business in Klamath Falls.  His printing firm was called W. O. Smith Printing Company.  While it was separate from his newspaper, it was located in the same building as the Evening Herald.  Smith was also a prominent member of the Klamath Falls community.  He was active in civic affairs and local politics.  He helped finance construction of the local Odd Fellows building, the first large office building in Klamath Falls.  He also joined the local Elks lodge and helped raise funds to build the Klamath Falls Elks building.  Smith later served as president of the local Elks lodge.  In politics, he was a strong supporter of the Republican Party, serving as a recording clerk for the Klamath Falls voting precinct and then as chairman of the Klamath County Republican Central Committee.  State representative   In 1912, Smith decided to run as a Republican for a District 21 seat in the Oregon House of Representatives.  At that time, District 21 had two seats that represented Grant, Klamath, and Lake counties as well as Crook County (which at that time, still included what are now Deschutes and Jefferson counties).  Smith and Vernon A. Forbes of Bend were the only Republicans to file for the District 21 seats. Since the Republican Party was allowed to nominate two candidates for the two District 21 seats, Smith and Forbes were both nominated in the Republican primary.  Since no Democratic candidates filed for the District 21 seats, Smith and Forbes were unopposed in the general election.  Smith took his seat in the Oregon House of Representatives on January 13, 1913, representing District 21.  He worked through the 1913 legislative session which ended on March 5.  During the session, he served on the powerful ways and means committee as well as the irrigation committee.  Later in the session, Smith was appointed to a special committee assigned to investigate conditions in Oregon’s state prisons.  Smith was an active member of the House throughout the session.  A fiscal conservative, Smith successfully pushed a bill through the legislature that standardized government accounting within the state.  After the session, he received special recognition from eastern Oregon farmers for his work on the irrigation committee.  In 1914, Smith decided to run for re-election, seeking to retain his District 21 House seat.  He was joined by fellow incumbent Republican, Vernon Forbes.  There were also two candidates running in the Democratic primary, P. H. Dencer of Bend and Fred W. Hyndman of Klamath Falls.  Since there were two District 21 seats available both parties could nominate two candidates for the general election.  As a result, all four candidates were advanced to the general election.  In the November election, Smith and Forbes retained their House seats.  The final general election tally was 1,366 votes for Smith, 1,157 votes for Forbes, 982 votes for Hyndman, and 742 votes for Dencer.  Smith began his second term representing House District 21 on January 11, 1915. The session lasted six weeks, ending on February 20.  During the session, Smith was appointed to the ways and means, irrigation, military affairs, and printing committees.  In 1916, Smith ran for a third term in the Oregon House of Representatives.  Since the 1914 election, Jefferson County had been separated from Crook County and Deschutes County was in the process of being created.  While these changes did not alter the boundaries of District 21, it did add two new counties to the district.  While Smith and Forbes had been the only two Republicans to file for the District 21 seats in the past two elections, two additional Republicans decided to join the field in 1916.  The two new Republican candidates were Denton G. Burdick of Redmond and Albert E. Elder of Klamath Falls.  In addition, Fred Hyndman filed as a Democrat.  In the Republican primary, Forbes and Burdick were advanced to the general election while Hyndman was nominated in the Democratic primary.  In 1920 and 1922, several Oregon newspapers identified Smith as a possible candidate for one of the District 21 seats.  However, he did not run for state office again.  Later life   After his 1916 primary defeat, Governor James Withycombe appointed Smith as Oregon’s delegate to the International Farm Congress and the International Irrigation Congress.  Both meetings were held in El Paso, Texas, in October 1916.  In 1920, Smith sold the Evening Herald to E. J. Murray so he could focus on his commercial printing business.  He modernized the company's printing operation, acquiring a new press with an automatic press feeder system.  In 1926, Smith moved his business to a new modern building in downtown Klamath Falls. Four years later, W. O. Smith Printing Company merged with Drummond Printing of Klamath Falls.  The new business brought together a full suite of modern printing equipment under one roof.  The company was incorporated in 1929 as Smith-Bates.  It was capitalized at $50,000 with 500 shares valued at $100 per share.  Smith and his wife were primary shareholders.  Instead of returning to state politics, Smith ran for a city council position in Klamath Falls.  He was elected and took his seat in 1921.  He served two terms on the city council.  After leaving the council, he continued to serve Klamath Falls as chairman of the city’s budget committee.  In 1930, the city of Klamath Fall decided to update its city charter.  Smith was appointed chairman of the 15-person committee that evaluated various options for improving the city’s government.  His committee recommended the city adopt a new form of government based on a city manager structure.  Smith also remained involved in fraternal and civic affairs.  He was active in the local Elks lodge.  He helped establish a Boy Scout program in Klamath Falls.  Smith was also a founding member of the local Rotary club and was that organization’s first president. In addition, he served as president and trustee of the local golf country club.    Due to an extended illness, Smith was confined to his home for the last six years of his life.  He died at his home in Klamath Falls on October 20, 1951 at the age 73.  His funeral service was held at the Klamath Falls Elks lodge on October 23, 1951.  Smith was buried in the Linkville Cemetery in Klamath Falls.

Smith's political career began when he served on the Lincoln City Council between 1983-1987 before being appointed Secretary of State of Nebraska by then-Governor Mike Johanns in 2002.    After two years at this post,  Smith ran unsuccessfully against incumbent Democratic U.S. Representative Jim Weidner in 2004 but defeated him again four years later in another close race.   During his time in Congress  Smith has been recognized for sponsoring legislation aimed at protecting children who are victims of sexual abuse;   improving access to health care services such as prescription drugs;    increasing funding for rural infrastructure projects; and supporting efforts to combat global warming through increased energy efficiency standards.  In 2010 Smith announced plans to run for governor following the resignation of Jon Bruning due to allegations of inappropriate behavior towards women while campaigning for office.   On November 2, 2011 Smith defeated Republican nominee Matt Mead in what many analysts called one of the most closely contested gubernatorial elections in recent history.   As governor,   Smith signed into law several bills designed to improve public safety including measures requiring background checks for private gun sales and banning text messaging while driving.

Big Boy Records,"Big Boy Records also known as the Boot Camp Clicc, was an independent record label established in late 1992 by Charles ""Big Boy"" Temple; Robert ""Big Rob"" Shaw"";and his producer Leroy ""Precise"" Edwards. For several years in the 1990s, Big Boy Records ruled the  hip hop music industry in New Orleans until No Limit Records and Cash Money Records became powerhouse labels.  History Big Boy's first signee was pioneering New Orleans rapper Sporty T (Terence Vine). He had previously been a founding member of The Ninja Crew, New Orleans' first rap group to record. In the early 1990s, inspired by hits by Juvenile and Everlasting Hitman's bounce hits, he moved in that direction as well. The label's first single was ""Sporty Talkin' Sporty."" Though bounce, it had an uncharacteristically heavy sound for the genre. After it sold 4,000 copies, Big Boy sought out more talent. In that same year Big Boy Signed Partners-N-Crime, a rapping duo from Hollygrove, New Orleans. When they dropped their single ""Let the Good Times Roll"" in 1994 it became an instant hit. Months later their debut album PNC 3 hit the stores. Later on in that year G-Slimm's Fours Deuces & Trays sold 200,000 copies. However, the label's first huge success came from a recently returned Gulf War veteran, Mystikal (Michael Ernest Tyler). The 12th Ward native had originally been with Parkway Pumpin as Mystikal Mike. Then he was poached by Big Boy, who released ""I'm Not That Nigga"" and a self-titled debut which sold 300,000 copies. Apparently bolstered by this considerable windfall, Big Boy made most of their promotional videos in the wake. After Mystikal signed with No Limit and the death of G-Slimm, Big Boy records slowly began to fall apart. In 2004 they released Big Boy Greatest Hits compilation album featuring all the greatest hits from 1992-2000.  In 2015, Charles ""Big Boy"" Temple died.

USS Atlanta (CL-51),"USS Atlanta (CL-51) of the United States Navy was the lead ship of the  of eight light cruisers. She was the third Navy ship named after the city of Atlanta, Georgia. Designed to provide anti-aircraft protection for US naval task groups, Atlanta served in this capacity in the naval battles Midway and the Eastern Solomons. Atlanta was heavily damaged by Japanese and friendly gunfire in a night surface action on 13 November 1942 during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. The cruiser was sunk on her captain's orders in the afternoon of the same day.  Atlanta, in some works, is designated CLAA-51 because of her primary armament as an anti-aircraft cruiser. Hence, all of the Atlanta-class ships are sometimes designated as CLAA. However, her entire battery of  guns were dual-purpose (DP) guns, and were capable of being used against both air and surface targets, able to fire anti-aircraft, high-explosive and armor-piercing shells.   The Atlanta-class ships were lightly armored, making them poor surface combatants compared to a typical light cruiser. In terms of armament, the Atlanta class was closer to a destroyer, being armed with 5-inch guns, than a light cruiser, which were generally equipped with 6-inch guns; but at well over  in length, and combined with their large battery of sixteen  guns (reduced to twelve in number for later ships of the class), they were designated as light cruisers. Typical destroyers of the time only carried five or six 5-inch guns.  Despite being under-armored for light cruisers, they had thicker armor than destroyers, which were notoriously underprotected.  Construction and commissioning The first of the new class of ships was laid down on 22 April 1940 at Kearny, New Jersey, by the Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Co., launched on 6 September 1941, sponsored by Margaret Mitchell (author of Gone with the Wind), and commissioned at the New York Navy Yard on 24 December 1941, Captain Samuel P. Jenkins in command.  Armament Atlanta was fitted with eight twin 5-inch gun mounts, placed in a unique configuration. She had three forward mounts and three aft mounts, mounted inline and increasing in height toward the midships, giving her a symmetrical appearance, with a ""gap"" in the middle superstructure. In addition, the aft battery also had one ""wing-mounted"" mount on each side, for a total of 16 five-inch guns. The firing arcs of the forward and aft batteries intersected at a very limited angle, giving her an arc of 60° in which she could fire all of her guns broadside (excluding the wing mounts). Because Atlanta was able to bring all her guns to bear only within that narrow arc, her ability to engage surface targets was limited. Her firing arcs were ideally suited to bringing her guns to bear on an aircraft, however, with a minimum of six guns available from any angle.  Service history After fitting out, Atlanta conducted shakedown training until 13 March 1942, first in Chesapeake Bay and then in Maine's Casco Bay, after which she returned to the New York Navy Yard for post-shakedown repairs and alterations. Adjudged to be ""ready for distant service"" on 31 March, the new cruiser departed New York for the Panama Canal Zone on 5 April. She reached Cristobal on 8 April. After transiting the isthmian waterway, Atlanta then cleared Balboa on 12 April with orders to reconnoiter Clipperton Island, a tiny barren, uninhabited atoll about 670 mi (1,080 km) southwest of Acapulco, Mexico, in the course of her voyage to the Hawaiian Islands, for any signs of enemy activity. Finding none, she ultimately reached Pearl Harbor on 23 April.  Battle of Midway  Punctuating her brief stay in Hawaiian waters with an antiaircraft practice off Oahu on 3 May, Atlanta, in company with , sailed on 10 May as escort for  and , bound for Nouméa, New Caledonia. On 16 May, she joined Vice Admiral William F. Halsey's Task Force 16 (TF 16), formed around the aircraft carriers  and , as it steamed back to Pearl Harbor, having been summoned back to Hawaiian waters in response to an imminent Japanese thrust in the direction of Midway Atoll. TF 16 arrived at Pearl on 26 May.  Atlanta again sailed with TF 16 on the morning of 28 May. Over the days that followed, she screened the carriers as they operated northeast of Midway in anticipation of the enemy's arrival. At the report of Japanese ships to the southwest, on the morning of 4 June, Atlanta cleared for action as she screened Hornet. Squadrons from the American carriers sought out the Japanese, and during that day, planes from  and Enterprise inflicted mortal damage on four irreplaceable enemy aircraft carriers. Japanese planes twice hit TF 17, and it took the brunt of the enemy attacks. Over the days that followed the Battle of Midway, Atlanta remained in the screen of TF 16 until 11 June, when the task force received orders to return to Pearl Harbor.  Reaching her destination on 13 June, Atlanta, outside brief periods of antiaircraft practice on 21 and 25–26 June, remained in port, taking on stores and provisions and standing on 24-hour and then 48-hour alert into July 1942. Drydocked on 1–2 July so that her bottom could be scraped, cleaned and painted, the cruiser completed her availability on 6 July and then resumed a busy schedule of gunnery practice with drone targets, high-speed sleds, and in shore bombardment in the Hawaiian operating area.  On 15 July 1942, Atlanta, again in TF 16, sailed for Tongatapu. Anchoring at Nukuʻalofa, Tonga on 24 July, where she fueled  and then took on fuel from Mobilube, the light cruiser pushed on later the same day and overtook TF 16. On 29 July, as all preparations proceeded for the invasion of Guadalcanal, Atlanta was assigned to TF 61.  Screening the carriers as they launched air strikes to support the initial landings on 7–8 August, Atlanta remained there until the withdrawal of the carrier task forces on 9 August. For the next several days, she remained at sea, replenishing when necessary while the task force operated near the Solomons.  Battle of the Eastern Solomons  As the Americans consolidated their gains on Guadalcanal, the critical need for reinforcements prompted Japanese Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto to send the Combined Fleet south to cover a large troop convoy. American scout planes spotted the Japanese forces on the morning of 23 August. With the enemy reported to the northwest, Enterprise and  launched search and attack planes, but they failed to make contact because of deteriorating weather and the fact that the Japanese, knowing that they had been spotted, reversed course.  Throughout the day on 24 August, Atlanta received enemy contact reports and screened Enterprise as she launched a strike group to attack the Japanese carriers. The sighting of an enemy ""snooper"" at 1328 sent Atlantas sailors to general quarters, where they remained for the next 5½ hours. At 1530, the cruiser worked up to  as TF 16 stood roughly north-northwestward ""to close [the] reported enemy carrier group."" At 1637, with unidentified planes approaching, Atlanta went to . Enterprise then launched a strike group shortly thereafter, completing the evolution at 1706.  In the meantime, the incoming enemy bombers and fighter aircraft from  and  prompted the task force to increase speed to , shortly after Enterprise completed launching her own aircraft, the Japanese raid, estimated by Captain Jenkins to consist of at least 18 Aichi D3A1 ""Val"" dive bombers, came in from the north northwest at 1710. Over the next 11 minutes, Atlantas ,  and 20 mm batteries contributed to the barrage over Enterprise, as the light cruiser conformed to Enterprises every move as she maneuvered violently to avoid the dive bombers.  Despite the heavy antiaircraft fire, Enterprise took one hit and suffered some shrapnel damage from an estimated five near hits. Captain Jenkins later reported that his ship may have shot down five of the attackers. Atlanta was not damaged in the engagement.  Reporting to TF 11 for duty the following day, Atlanta operated with that force, redesignated TF 61 on 30 August, over the next few days. When  torpedoed Saratoga on 31 August, the light cruiser screened the stricken flagship as  rigged a towline and began taking her out of danger. The force ultimately put into Tongatapu on 6 September, where Atlanta provisioned ship, fueled from , and enjoyed a period of upkeep.  Underway on 13 September, the light cruiser escorted  and  on 15 September. After seeing her charges safely to their destination at Dumbea Bay, Nouméa, on 19 September, Atlanta fueled, took on stores and ammunition, and sailed on 21 September as part of Task Group 66.4 (TG 66.4). Becoming part of TF 17 on 23 September, the light cruiser was detached the following day to proceed in company with ,  and  to Tongatapu, which she reached on 26 September.  Underway with those same ships on 7 October, Atlanta briefly escorted Guadalcanal-bound transports from 11 to 14 October, before putting into Espiritu Santo for fuel on the afternoon of the 15th. Assigned then to Rear Admiral Willis A. Lee's TF 64, the ship sailed after dark that same day to resume operations covering the ongoing efforts to secure Guadalcanal. Returning briefly to Espiritu Santo for fuel, stores and provisions, the warship stood out from Segond Channel on the afternoon of 23 October.  Two days later, with a Japanese Army offensive having failed to eject the Americans from Guadalcanal, Admiral Yamamoto sent the Combined Fleet south in an attempt to annihilate the American naval forces doggedly supporting the marines. Atlanta operated in TF 64, along with Washington, ,  and two destroyers, as the opposing forces engaged in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands on 26 October. That day, Atlanta patrolled astern of the fueling group supporting the two American carrier task forces. On 27 October, when  attacked TF 64, the force maneuvered at high speed to clear the area.  On the morning of 28 October, Atlanta brought on board Rear Admiral Norman Scott from San Francisco, and became the flagship of the newly designated TG 64.2. After fueling from Washington, Atlanta, screened by four destroyers, headed northwest to shell Japanese positions on Guadalcanal. Reaching the waters off Lunga Point on the morning of 30 October, Atlanta embarked Marine liaison officers at 0550, and then steamed west, commencing her bombardment of Point Cruz at 0629 while the destroyers formed a column astern. Provoking no return fire, TG 64.2 accomplished its mission and returned to Lunga Point, where Atlanta disembarked the liaison officers. She then proceeded, in company with her screen, to Espiritu Santo, where she arrived on the afternoon of 31 October.  Naval Battle of Guadalcanal  Convoy escort  Atlanta served as Admiral Scott's flagship as the light cruiser, accompanied by four destroyers, escorted ,  and  to Guadalcanal. The cruiser and her consorts continued to screen those ships, designated TG 62.4, as they lay off Lunga Point on 12 November unloading supplies and disembarking troops.  At 0905, the task group received a report that nine bombers and 12 fighters were approaching from the northwest, and would reach their vicinity at about 0930. At about 0920, Atlanta led the three auxiliaries to the north in column, with the destroyers spaced in a circle around them. 15 minutes later, nine ""Vals"" from  emerged from the clouds over Henderson Field, the American airstrip on Guadalcanal. The American ships opened fire soon after, putting up a barrage that downed ""several"" planes. Fortunately, none of the primary targets of the attack, Zeilin, Libra and Betelgeuse, suffered more than minor damage from several close calls, though Zeilin sustained some flooding. The three auxiliaries returned to the waters off Lunga Point as soon as the attack ended and resumed working cargo and disembarking troops.  A little over an hour later, at 1050, Atlanta received word of another incoming Japanese air raid. 15 minutes later, Atlanta led the three auxiliaries north with the destroyers in a circle around the disposition. The ""bogeys"", 27 Mitsubishi G4M ""Bettys"" from Rabaul, closed, sighted bearing west by north, approaching from over Cape Esperance in a very loose ""V"" formation. Although the destroyers opened fire, the planes proved to be out of range and the ships checked fire. The ""Bettys"", for their part, ignored the ships and continued on to bomb Henderson Field. Upon the disappearance of the planes, TG 62.4 resumed unloading off Lunga Point.  On 12 November, Atlanta was still off Lunga Point, screening the unloading, as part of TF 67 under Rear Admiral Daniel J. Callaghan in San Francisco. At about 1310, Atlanta received a warning that 25 enemy planes were headed for Guadalcanal, slated to arrive within 50 minutes. The light cruiser went to general quarters at 1318 and received the signal ""prepare to repel air attack....""  Within six minutes, Atlanta and the other combatants of the support group formed a screen around the transport group (TG 67.1), and the two groups steamed north together at . At about 1410, the Americans sighted the incoming raid, consisting of what appeared to be 25 twin-engined bombers (""Bettys"") which broke up into two groups after clearing Florida Island, and came in at altitudes that ranged from .  opened fire at 1412. Atlanta did so a minute later, training her guns at planes headed for the gap in the screen between San Francisco and . Atlanta claimed to have shot down two ""Bettys"", just after they dropped their torpedoes, at about 1415, only three minutes before the attack ended. Once the last Japanese plane had been splashed, the work of unloading the transports and cargo ships resumed. One ""Betty"", crippled by antiaircraft fire, crashed into the after superstructure of San Francisco, inflicting the only damage on the force.  Night attack The abrupt end of the air attack gave Atlanta and her colleagues only a brief respite, however, for trouble approached from yet another quarter. A Japanese surface force, made up of two battleships, one cruiser and six destroyers, was detected steaming south toward Guadalcanal to shell Henderson Field. Admiral Callaghan's support group was to ""cover [the retiring transports and cargo vessels] against enemy attack."" TG 67.4 departed Lunga Point about 1800 and steamed eastward through Sealark Channel, covering the withdrawal of TG 67.1. An hour before midnight, Callaghan's ships reversed course and headed westward.  Helenas radar picked up the first contact at a range of . As the range closed, Atlantas surface search radar, followed by her gunnery radars, picked up a contact on the enemy ships.  Admiral Callaghan's order for a course change caused problems almost at once, as Atlanta had to turn to port (left) immediately to avoid a collision with one of the four destroyers in the van, the latter having apparently executed a ""ships left"" rather than ""column left"" movement. As Atlanta began moving to resume her station ahead of San Francisco, the  illuminated the light cruiser. Atlanta shifted her main battery to fire at the enemy destroyer, opening fire at a range of about  and, along with other US ships that concentrated on Akatsukis searchlights, overwhelmed the destroyer.  As two other Japanese destroyers crossed her line, Atlanta engaged both with her forward  mounts, while her after mounts continued to blast away at the illuminated ship. An additional, unidentified assailant also opened up on the light cruiser from the northeast. At about that time, at least one torpedo plowed into Atlantas forward engine room from the port side, fired almost certainly by either  or  (Akatsukis destroyer consorts). Atlanta lost all but auxiliary diesel power, suffered the interruption of her gunfire, and had to shift steering control to the steering engine room aft. Meanwhile, Akatsuki drifted out of the action and soon sank with heavy loss of life. Michiharu Shinya, Akatsukis Chief Torpedo Officer, one of her few survivors, was rescued the next day by US forces and spent the rest of the war in a New Zealand prisoner of war camp. He later stated unequivocally that Akatsuki had not been able to fire any torpedoes that night before being overwhelmed by gunfire.  Soon after being torpedoed, Atlanta was then hit by an estimated nineteen 8-inch (203 mm) shells when San Francisco, ""in the urgency of battle, darkness, and confused intermingling of friend or foe"", fired into her. Though almost all of the shells passed through the thin skin of the ship without detonating, scattering green dye, fragments from their impact killed many men, including Admiral Scott and members of his staff. Atlanta prepared to return fire on her new assailant, but San Francisco's own gun flashes disclosed a distinctly ""non-Japanese hull profile"" that resulted in a suspension of those efforts. San Francisco's shells, which passed high through Atlanta's superstructure, may have been intended for a Japanese target further beyond her from San Francisco's perspective.  After the  fire ceased, Atlantas Captain Jenkins took stock of the situation, and, having only a minor foot wound, made his way aft to Battle II. His ship was badly battered, largely powerless, down by the head and listing slightly to port, and a third of his crew was dead or missing. As the battle continued, the light cruiser's men began clearing debris, jettisoning topside weight to correct the list, reducing the volume of sea water in the ship, and succoring the many wounded.  Sinking Daylight revealed the presence nearby of three burning American destroyers, the disabled Portland, and the abandoned hulk of , which Portland summarily dispatched with three salvoes. Atlanta, drifting toward the enemy-held shore east of Cape Esperance, dropped her starboard anchor, and her captain sent a message to Portland explaining the light cruiser's condition. Boats from Guadalcanal came out to take her most critically wounded. By mid-morning, all of those had been taken off the ship.   arrived at 09:30 on 13 November, took Atlanta under tow, made harder by the cruiser's still lowered anchor, and headed toward Lunga Point. During the voyage, a ""Betty"" bomber neared the disposition, and one of the two surviving  mounts—which was powered by a diesel generator—fired and drove it off. The other manually-rotated mount could not be trained on the target in time.  Atlanta reached Kukum about 14:00, at which point Captain Jenkins conferred with his remaining officers. As Jenkins, who was later awarded a Navy Cross for his heroism during the battle, later wrote, ""It was by now apparent that efforts to save the ship were useless, and that the water was gaining steadily."" Even had sufficient salvage facilities been available, he allowed, the severe damage she had taken would have made it difficult to save the ship. Authorized by Commander, South Pacific Forces, to act at his own discretion regarding the destruction of the ship, Jenkins ordered that Atlanta be abandoned and sunk with a demolition charge.  Accordingly, all remaining men except the captain and a demolition party boarded Higgins boats sent out from Guadalcanal for the purpose. After the charge had been set and exploded, the last men left the battered ship. Ultimately, at 20:15 on 13 November 1942, Atlanta sank 3 mi (5 km) west of Lunga Point in about 400 ft (120 m) of water. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 13 January 1943.  Exploration of the wreck The wreck of USS Atlanta was discovered in 1992 by an expedition led by Dr. Robert Ballard using a remotely operated underwater vehicle, (ROV). Dr. Ballard was famous for leading the expeditions that discovered  and the . Unfortunately, strong ocean currents and poor visibility prevented the expedition from thoroughly exploring Atlanta. In 1994, two Australian technical divers Rob Cason and Kevin Denlay traveled to Solomon Islands with the intention of being the first scuba divers to dive Atlanta but this was unsuccessful because of the lack of a suitable surface support vessel and strong surface currents; this was also the first mixed gas scuba diving expedition to Guadalcanal. However, they did manage to dive one of the two other deepest diveable wrecks; the Japanese transport Azumasan Maru, which is almost  deep at the stern. Many other World War II wrecks discovered by Dr. Ballard in Iron Bottom Sound are beyond the current technical limit for scuba and are only accessible by ROVs or submersibles. Dr Ballard gives an account of this in his book The Lost Ships of Guadalcanal. In 1995 Denlay returned with American Terrance Tysall - with the specific intention of diving USS Atlanta -  and one of their 'work-up dives' was on the Sasako Maru, one of the other  deepest diveable wrecks at the time, which is over  in the collapsed debris field of the bridge. They then went on to make the first successful scuba dive on USS Atlanta, which was at the time the deepest wreck dive by free swimming divers in the southern hemisphere.  In the following years, Denlay and Tysall mounted several larger expeditions to survey Atlanta, exploring and videoing the wreck in detail to a depth of  at the bow. The civil unrest in Solomon Islands from late 1998 prevented further diving around Guadalcanal for several years. However, on the final expedition that year, the then deepest wreck dive by a woman was made by Kevin's wife, Mirja, on Atlanta. Denlay's last visit to the wreck was in 2002 using a closed circuit rebreather or CCR, the first CCR dive on Atlanta. Since then, very few dives have been conducted on Atlanta, although in May 2011 a very experienced deep diving team from Global Underwater Explorers successfully videoed the wreck for documentary purposes, the first survey of the wreck since Denlay's expeditions up to 1998.  Awards Atlanta was awarded five battle stars for her World War II service and a Presidential Unit Citation for her ""heroic example of invincible fighting spirit"" in the battle off Guadalcanal on 13 November 1942.

Business casual,"Business casual is an ambiguously defined Western dress code that is generally considered casual wear but with smart (in the sense of ""well dressed"") components of a proper lounge suit from traditional informal wear, adopted for  white-collar workplaces. This interpretation typically including dress shirt, necktie, and trousers, but worn with an odd-coloured blazer or a sports coat instead.  Acceptance of business casual in the United States was preceded by Casual Fridays which originated in California in the 1990s, in turn inspired by the Hawaiian 1960s casual custom of Aloha Friday. The designation of particular clothing pieces as ""business casual"" may be contentious.  Definition There is no generally agreed definition of ""business casual"".  One definition of business casual states that it includes khaki pants, slacks, and skirts, as well as short-sleeved polo shirts  and long-sleeved shirts, but excludes jeans, tight or short skirts, T-shirts, and sweatshirts. Another source, an American university careers service, states that business casual consists of neutral colors more towards the dark shades of black, gray, navy, but can include white and off white, and reminds that the clothing should be pressed and have clean, crisp seams. The ""Dress for Success"" advice from the University of Toronto sums up business casual as ""a classic, clean cut, and put together look where a full suit is not required,"" which means slacks, khakis, or skirts; blouses, polo shirts, or shirts with collar but no necktie; some sweaters; and closed-toe shoes. The Canadian university ends with the warning that ""it is not clothing you would wear to a club or for athletic purposes.... Don’t let the word casual mislead you. You still need to look professional.""  Another author wrote in the Financial Times that ""Ordinarily business casual for guys seems fairly clear. It is a pair of chinos, a blazer and a good shirt, no tie.""   A writer wrote in a workwear Blog that ""Business casual attire for also men consists of dress pants, dockers-type pants, khakis and a shirt. They also wear a golf-type shirt instead of a traditional shirt, and they wear sweaters or vests on top of the shirt. Women’s choose to wear pants or skirts with a top or blouses paired with a sweater.""  A BBC article suggested that a ""safe global standard"" consists of ""a button down shirt,"" ""jackets or blazers, khaki or gray slacks, and leather shoes."" It warned, however, that great variation exists between countries and regions within countries. A U.S. menswear retailer advises men to wear a collared shirt, chinos, navy blazer, and brown shoes, while making sure to look ""clean and well-groomed.""  A contributor to Forbes asked her Facebook friends to define business casual, and found a slightly more casual apparent consensus not forcibly including a jacket: ""For men: trousers/khakis and a shirt with a collar. For women: trousers/knee-length skirt and a blouse or shirt with a collar. No jeans. No athletic wear."" A response to that was ""I disagree. No khakis."" She states that ""there’s a lack of consensus in what actually defines a business casual wardrobe. All most people know is they don’t want to see too much of a colleague’s body, including feet.""

Hollow fiber bioreactor,"A Hollow fiber bioreactor is a 3 dimensional cell culturing system based on hollow fibers, which are small, semi-permeable capillary membranes arranged in parallel array with a typical molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) range of 10-30 kDa. These hollow fiber membranes are often bundled and housed within tubular polycarbonate shells to create hollow fiber bioreactor cartridges. Within the cartridges, which are also fitted with inlet and outlet ports, are two compartments: the intracapillary (IC) space within the hollow fibers, and the extracapillary (EC) space surrounding the hollow fibers.  Cells are seeded into the EC space of the hollow fiber bioreactor and expand there. Cell culture medium is pumped through the IC space and delivers oxygen and nutrients to the cells via hollow fiber membrane perfusion. As the cells expand, their waste products and CO2 also perfuse the hollow fiber membranes and are carried away by the pumping of medium through the IC space. As waste products build up due to increased cell mass, the rate of medium flow can also be increased so that cell growth is not inhibited by waste product toxicity.  Because thousands of hollow fibers may be packed into a single hollow fiber bioreactor, they increase the surface area of the cartridge considerably. As a result, cells can fill up the EC space to densities >108 cells/ml. However, the cartridge itself takes up a very small volume (oftentimes the volume of a 12-oz soda can). The fact that hollow fiber bioreactors are very small and yet enable incredibly high cell densities has led to their development for both research and commercial applications, including monoclonal antibody and influenza vaccine production. Likewise, because hollow fiber bioreactors use up significantly less medium and growth factors than traditional cell culture methods such as stirred-tank bioreactors, they offer a significant cost savings. Finally, hollow fiber bioreactors are sold as single-use disposables, resulting in significant time savings for laboratory staff and technicians.  History  In 1972, the Richard Knazek group at the NIH reported how mouse fibroblasts cultured on 1.5 cm3 hollow fiber capillary membranes composed of cellulose acetate were able to form 1 mm-wide nodules in 28 days. The group recorded the final cell number as approximately 1.7 x 107 cells from a starter batch of only 200,000 cells. When the same group cultured human choriocarcinoma cells on polymeric and silicone polycarbonate capillary membranes totaling less than 3 cm3 in volume, the cells expanded to an amount approximating 2.17 x 108 cells.  The Knazek group was awarded the patent for hollow fiber bioreactor technology in 1974. Based on this patented technology, companies began building different and larger (commercial) scale hollow fiber bioreactors, with significant development and technological improvement occurring in the late 1980s to early 1990s. By 1990, at least three companies were reported to offer commercially available hollow fiber bioreactors.  One engineering advance included adding a gas exchange cartridge, which enabled better control of system's pH and oxygen levels. Similar to a mammalian lung, the gas exchange cartridge efficiently oxygenated the culture medium, allowing the bioreactor to support higher numbers of cells. Combined with the ability to add or remove CO2 for precise pH control, the limitations commonly associated with large-scale cell culture were eliminated, resulting in densely packed cell cultures that could be maintained for several months.  In addition, control of the fluid dynamics within each hollow fiber bioreactor led to further optimization of the cell culture environment. By alternating the pressure gradient across the hollow fiber membrane, media could flow back and forth between the EC side (cell compartment) and the IC side (hollow fiber lumen). This process, combined with the axial media flow created when media passes down the length of the fibers, optimized the growth environment throughout the entire bioreactor.  This concept is termed EC cycling, and was developed as a solution to the gradients that form within hollow fiber bioreactors when media is pushed down the length of their fibers. Higher hydrostatic pressure at the axial end (media entering the fiber lumen) compared to the distal end of the bioreactor creates a Starling flow in the EC space, which is similar to what is observed in the body. This phenomenon also creates a nutrient-rich axial region and a nutrient-depleted distal region within the bioreactor. By incorporating EC cycling, the effects of Starling flow are eliminated and the entire bioreactor becomes nutrient-rich and optimized for cell growth.  Optimal IC and EC space perfusion rates must be achieved in order to efficiently deliver media nutrients and growth supplements, respectively, and to collect supernatant. During the cell growth phase within these bioreactors, the media feed rate is increased to accommodate the expanding cell population. More specifically, the IC media perfusion rate is increased to provide additional glucose and oxygen to the cells while continually removing metabolic wastes such as lactic acid. When the cell space is completely filled with cells, the media feed rate plateaus, resulting in constant glucose consumption, oxygen uptake and lactate production rates.  Applications  With the introduction of hybridoma technology in 1975, cell culture could be applied towards the generation of secreted proteins such as monoclonal antibodies, growth hormones, and even some categories of vaccines. In order to produce these proteins on a commercial scale, new methods for culturing large batches of cells had to be developed. One such technological development was the hollow fiber bioreactor.  Hollow fiber bioreactors are used to generate high concentrations of cell-derived products including monoclonal antibodies, recombinant proteins, growth factors, viruses and virus-like particles. This is possible because the semi-permeable hollow fiber membranes allow for the passage of low molecular weight nutrients and wastes from the cell-containing EC into the non-cell-containing IC space, but they do not allow the passage of larger products such as antibodies. Therefore, as a cell line (e.g., hybridoma) expands and expresses a target protein, that protein remains within the EC space and is not flushed out. At a given time point (or continually during the culture), the harvest supernatant (product) is collected, clarified and refrigerated for a future downstream application.  Smaller hollow fiber bioreactors are often used for selection and optimization of cell lines prior to stepping up to larger cell culturing systems. Doing so saves on growth factor costs because a significant portion of the cell culture media does not require the addition of expensive components like fetal bovine serum. Likewise, the smaller hollow fiber bioreactors can be housed in a laboratory incubator just like cell culture plates and flasks.     Recently, hollow fiber bioreactors have been tested as novel platforms for the commercial production of high-titer influenza A virus. In this study, both adherent and suspension Madin-Darby Canine Kidney Epithelial Cells (MDCK) were infected with two different strains of influenza: A/PR/8/34 (H1N1), and the pandemic strain A/Mexico/4108/2009 (H1N1). High titers were achieved for both the suspension and adherent strains; furthermore, the hollow fiber bioreactor technology was found comparable in its production capacity to that of other commercial bioreactors on the market, including classic stirred-tank and wave bioreactors (Wave) and ATF perfusion systems.

Simon de Brantingham,"Simon de Brantingham was an English noble of the mid-fourteenth century.  During the reign of Edward III, de Brantingham held the stewardship of the Hospital of St John the Baptist in Dorchester, Dorset, although his involvement in the embezzlement and wanton disposal of the hospital's assets resulted in his replacement by Thomas de Brantingham in 1360.  Stewardship of the Hospital of St John the Baptist De Brantingham was implicated in the wasteful and destructive administration of the Hospital of St John the Baptist in Dorchester, which had suffered the alienation of so much of its land that it was no longer capable of almsgiving.  A royal inquiry, commissioned by writ of 18 November 1359, headed by the county escheator and with a jury empanelled to hear the findings, found that de Brantingham, then steward of the hospital, had not only alienated land but also carried off chattels from the hospital, including linens and bedding.  Shortly after the commission reached its finding, de Brantingham appears to have been dismissed and, in any event, the following year, as recorded in the patent rolls for 6 June 1360, King Edward III granted the stewardship of the hospital to Thomas de Brantingham.  Legal duties De Brantingham and his son, Walter, appear as a witness to the grant, on 2 July 1324, of a messuage and appurtenances on the high street in Beverley, between Margaret, widow of Walter de Brychton of Beverley, and Roger Northiby of Walkington.

Internorm,"Internorm International GmbH is an Austrian brand founded in 1931 that specializes in the manufacture of windows and doors. Its headquarters are located in Traun, Upper Austria. The company is a family business, currently run by the third generation.  Internorm distributes its products through 10 sales offices and more than 1,300 selected sales partners in 22 countries. 55% of its sales are generated through exports.  History  Internorm started when its founder, Eduard Klinger Sr. established a building and construction workshop in Linz, in 1931. In the following years, Eduard Klinger Sr. expanded his company from a one-man operation to a medium-sized metal construction company. In 1963, seeing the potential of pioneering products made from UPVC (unplasticized polyvinyl chloride), he acquired the first license for the construction of UPVC window frames in Austria.  The company, under the name of ""Internorm"", started producing UPVC windows in 1966. The first production site was in Traun, the location of the company's headquarters. In 1967, Eduard Klinger Sr. gave each of his three children, Eleonore, Eduard and Helmut a 25% holding in the company. Under the leadership of the second generation, Internorm developed into the market leader for windows and doors in Austria. The rapid growth of the company required a second production site, which Internorm found through the acquisition in 1977 of a local window manufacturer in Sarleinsbach. A third plant was set up in Lannach, Styria, in 1982. In 1988, the first Internorm timber windows were produced in this plant. Today, the plant specializes in Timber/Aluminium products.  In 1997, the 2nd generation left the operations side of the business and joined the supervisory board, each being replaced by one of their children – Anette Klinger, Christian Klinger and Stephan Kubinger – on the executive board. In 2001, Internorm reached a figure of 10 million products sold.  In 2002, Internorm founded the ""International Windows Network (IFN)"", a new umbrella company to which Internorm belongs to. Other independent and specialist companies emerged alongside Internorm with the goal of developing synergies for sharing knowledge and innovations. The group has around 2,900 employees, with approximately 1,800 of them working at Internorm.  Distribution   Internorm has its own sales offices in Austria, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, France, Slovenia, Croatia, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Great Britain. Through a two-stage distribution process, the Austrian products are sold in Europe through more than 1,000 sales partners in the mentioned countries, as well as in Luxembourg, Liechtenstein, Belgium, Romania, Poland, Denmark, the Netherlands, Greece and Ireland. All of Internorm's products are produced in Austria through its three production sites.  Product   The range of products includes UPVC, UPVC/aluminium and timber/aluminium windows as well as house doors made from aluminium and timber/aluminium. Internorm also manufactures sliding, balcony and side entrance doors and a range of accessories such as sun protection, insect repellent and window and door handles.  The products are marketed in four design styles: Studio, Home Pure, Home Soft and Ambiente.  In 2012, Internorm launched a series of technologies marketed under the name ""I-tec"". These include a new locking system with invisible fitting and higher safety, a ventilation system integrated into the window and an energy-efficient shading system for composite windows. With an intelligent building control, the Internorm products can be conveniently controlled via tablet or smartphone.  Facilities  The headquarters of ""International Window Network (IFN)"" and ""Internorm International GmbH"" are located at the Traun site.

Dervendjis,"Derbendcis or Derbentler were the most important and largest Ottoman military auxiliary constabulary units usually responsible for guarding important roads, bridges, fords or mountain passes. Usually, the population of an entire village near some important pass would be assigned with derbendci status in exchange for tax exemptions.  Etymology   The name is derived from a Persian word Dar-band meaning ""pass"", ""gateway"" or ""closer of the door"".  History The Ottomans had common practice to exempt some of their tax-paying subjects (rayah) from paying certain taxes in exchange for some services. In case of derbendcis this also included military services such as guarding mountain passes. Usually the entire villages were assigned with this duty and exempted from paying war time taxes (), customary taxes (), service as oarsmen in the Ottoman navy and devşirme of their boys into janissaries. In the region of northern Macedonia at least 175 villages had derbendci status and enjoyed these kind of tax exemptions. Sometimes the Ottoman state ""created"" villages around derbend territories while in some cases the existing villages applied to their kadı to receive derbendci status in exchange for providing security, constructing or maintaining roads and bridges. Newly settled population of such villages was not exempt from paying avariz taxes.  Their duty was to patrol the territory they were assigned to (derbend), similar to immobile gendarmerie. Since the end of the 18th century derbedcis were organized within Derbendat Ministry () that appointed derbend aghas () whose post lasted one year.  Derbendci status was compulsory and hereditary. If some individual or group would escape from their duty, the Ottomans would forcefully return them. They were organized into simple structures of 30 men (tabl) whose members performed rotational duties. Initially they carried only light weapons and later also fire guns. Significant part of this units were Christians who were, because of their derbendci duty, allowed to ride horses and carry weapon, but only of conventional type. Because derbendcis were poorly motivated, they could not match trained and better armed soldiers, so the Ottomans had to hire mercenaries (Christians or Muslims) to ensure loyalty of derbendcis, especially since the beginning of the decline of the Ottoman Empire at the end of the 17th century.

Everybody Wants to Rule the World,"""Everybody Wants to Rule the World"" is a song by English pop rock band Tears for Fears. It was written by Roland Orzabal, Ian Stanley, and Chris Hughes and produced by Hughes. The song was first released on 18 March 1985 by Phonogram, Mercury, and Vertigo Records as the third single from the band's second album, Songs from the Big Chair (1985). ""Everybody Wants to Rule the World"" is a new wave and synth-pop song with lyrics that detail the desire humans have for control and power and centre on themes of corruption.  Music critics praised ""Everybody Wants to Rule the World"" in their retrospective reviews, with some ranking the song among the decade's best. Along with ""Shout"" (1984), it is one of the band's signature songs. An international success, the song peaked at number two in Ireland, Australia, and the United Kingdom and at number one in Canada, New Zealand, and on both the US Billboard Hot 100 and Cashbox. It was certified gold by both Music Canada (MC) and the British Phonographic Industry (BPI).  Nigel Dick directed the music video, which received promotion from MTV. It shows bassist Curt Smith (who sings lead vocal) driving an antique Austin-Healey 3000 sports car around Southern California intercut with shots of the band performing the song in a studio. In 1986, the song won Best Single at the Brit Awards. The group re-recorded the song as a charity single for the Sport Aid campaign.  Background and release ""Everybody Wants to Rule the World"" was written by Roland Orzabal, Ian Stanley and Chris Hughes, and produced by Hughes. The song was a ""last-minute"" addition during recording sessions of Songs from the Big Chair (1985). The decision to include the song in the album came after Orzabal played two chords on his acoustic guitar for Hughes. It was recorded in two weeks and added as the final track on the album. According to Orzabal, the final line in the song's chorus, originally written as ""Everybody wants to go to war"", contributed to his indifference towards the track.  In an interview with Mix magazine, Hughes said that ""as a piece of recording history, [the song is] bland as hell."" Orzabal's unimpressed reaction to the track during their songwriting sessions prompted Hughes to convince him to record it, in a calculated effort to garner American chart success. After completing their sessions at 6p.m., they would spend an hour reviewing each recording many times; this helped Orzabal to create the song's guitar figure and change its title. Orzabal acknowledged that the shuffle beat used in the song was ""alien"" to their way of writing music, stating it was ""jolly rather than square and rigid in the manner of 'Shout', but it continued the process of becoming more extrovert."" Curt Smith, the song's lead singer, said the themes were ""quite serious – it's about everybody wanting power, about warfare and the misery it causes.""  ""Everybody Wants to Rule the World"" was first released on 18 March 1985 through Phonogram, Mercury and Vertigo Records as the third single from the band's second studio album, Songs from the Big Chair. The song was released for sale (as a 7-inch, 10-inch and 12-inch vinyl set) which included its B-side, interviews from the band and different versions of the song. To accommodate the vinyl release, a CD video set was also distributed and included the song's music video along audios of bonus tracks.  Composition and lyrical interpretation  ""Everybody Wants to Rule the World"" is a new wave and synth-pop song. The song is set in the key of D major with a  time signature and a tempo of 116 beats per minute. The band stated that the driving shuffle rhythm was influenced by Simple Minds' 1983 song ""Waterfront"", and Linx's 1981 song ""Throw Away the Key"". ""Everybody Wants to Rule the World"" incorporates synthesizers, guitar, a shuffle groove, two guitar solos, and keyboards.  The song's lyrics detail the desire humans have for control and power. In 2017, Tal Rosenberg of Pitchfork stated that its lyrics could be applied in different scenarios such as the environment (""Turn your back on mother nature""), short-lived financial success (""Help me make the most of freedom and of pleasure/Nothing ever lasts forever""), dictatorial rule (""Even while we sleep/We will find you""), and the Cold War (""Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down"").  The song's lyrics have elicited different political interpretations. The Economist writer K.Y.W. called the track a Cold War anthem and noted its timeless message, stating that ""the song's lyrics speak to the anxieties of every age."" Marc Ambinder from The Atlantic used the lyrics ""Say that you'll never, never, never need it / One headline, why believe it? / Everybody wants to rule the world"" in his article about the United States government's use of ""original classified authority"" and the abuse of power between the branches of government. Dominic Pino of National Review described the track as a ""conservative pop song"", noting the lyrics' tension between ""personal ambition"" and ""channeling that personal ambition to good ends"", comparing these themes to James Madison's concerns about private interest in the Federalist Papers. Curt Smith challenged this interpretation.  Tears for Fears revisited the song and its message in a 2017 interview with Yahoo! Music, stating that the song's themes were still ""just as poignant"" as they were when they first wrote it. They mentioned that they discussed the Cold War with ""Everybody Wants to Rule the World"" and Songs from the Big Chair but that was the ""U.S. and Russia then, and now the concern is more with the U.S. and [North] Korea.""  Reception Consequence of Sound editor Michael Roffman praised the group for being able to produce a ""timeless and influential composition"" with minimal effort. Roffman also noted that ""Everybody Wants to Rule the World"" was appropriate when it was first released, calling it a ""meditative commentary on an era that was so corrupt economically and spiritually."" AllMusic's Stanton Swihart expressed in his retrospective review that the group ""perfectly captured the zeitgeist of the mid-'80s while impossibly managing to also create a dreamy, timeless pop classic."" Pitchfork called it a song with ""near-universal appeal"", as well as a staple for ""classic-rock radio, pharmacies, bars, and parties."" In their review for the best albums of the 1980s, Eric Henderson from Slant Magazine stated that the song ""seems like one of the great indictments of the materialism and false triumphalism of the decade.""  ""Everybody Wants to Rule the World"" was voted the 25th best single in The Village Voices Pazz & Jop critics' poll for 1985 with 17 points, sharing the spot with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers' ""Don't Come Around Here No More"" (1985) and Sade's ""Smooth Operator"" (1984). Pitchfork placed the song at number 82 on their list for the best songs of the 80s expressing that ""underneath the synth-pop sheen, its vague message"" and its lesson in how power-driven society could be, the song was able to reach ""Reagan and Margaret-era youth fed up with political greed."" Kevin Korber from Spectrum Culture ranked the song at 24 on his 80s decade list, calling the song a ""testament to how much of a free-for-all the pop landscape was in the 1980s."" Korber dismissed the song's vague lyrics but praised its complex melodic structure, saying it was ""both the perfect representation of its time and a timeless composition."" Treble included the song at number 49 on their decade list. In 2021, Rolling Stone ranked the song at number 319 in their updated list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.  In 1986, the song won ""Best Single"" at the Brit Awards. Band member and co-writer Roland Orzabal argued that the song deserved to win the Ivor Novello International Hit of the Year award, claiming that the winner—""19"" by Paul Hardcastle—was not an actual song, but only a ""dialogue collage"". In 2015, 30 years after its release, the song was honoured at the annual BMI Awards in London for achieving 6 million radio airplays. ""Everybody Wants to Rule the World"" is regarded as the group's signature song, along with ""Shout"" (1984).  ""Everybody Wants to Rule the World"" was banned for broadcast by the BBC for the duration of the first Gulf War (2 August 199028 February 1991) due to the song's political themes.  Tears For Fears played the song live on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” the night Russia invaded Ukraine.  Commercial performance In the United Kingdom, ""Everybody Wants to Rule the World"" debuted at number 16 on the UK Singles Chart, in the issue dated 24 March 1985. On the week of 14 April 1985, the song peaked at number two.

In the United States, ""Everybody Wants to Rule the World"" debuted at number 70 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the issue dated 16 March 1985. On the week of 27 April 1985, the song rose to number 18. On the week of 8 June 1985, the song moved 2–1, replacing Wham!'s ""Everything She Wants"" (1984) as the number one on the chart; it would spend a total of two weeks in this position. The song was a commercial success in other American markets, peaking at number two on the Adult Contemporary and Top Rock Tracks and charting at number one on the Hot Dance Club Play, Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales, and Cash Box charts. It ranks as the 345th best-charting single of all time in the United States. In Canada, the song reached the number one spot, earning a gold certification from Music Canada (MC) for 40,000 sales shipments on 1 May 1985.  In Australia, the song reached the number two position. On the report dated 19 May 1985, the song debuted at number four on the New Zealand Top 40 Singles chart; it would later peak at number one. It was certified Gold by the Recorded Music NZ (RMNZ) for sales of 10,000.  B-side: ""Pharaohs""  ""Pharaohs"" is the B-side to the ""Everybody Wants to Rule the World"" single. It samples a recording of BBC Radio 4 announcer Brian Perkins reading the Shipping Forecast for the North Sea region of the United Kingdom. The title of the song has an identical enunciation to the Faroe Islands (""Faroes""), one of the places referenced in the forecast. Orzabal, Ian Stanley, Curt Smith and Hughes share writing credits. ""Pharaohs"" is included on the Groove Armada compilation album Back to Mine (2000). Chris Hughes wrote about the song in the liner notes of Saturnine Martial & Lunatic (1996), saying:  ""Pharaohs"" shipping forecast read by Brian Perkins:  Music video  The promotional video for ""Everybody Wants to Rule the World"", filmed in early 1985, was directed by Nigel Dick. It was filmed in Las Vegas, Los Angeles, a desert in Southern California, the Salton Sea and Cabazon as well as a London studio. Curt Smith admitted to Pitchfork that the video shoot was a ""disaster""; Dick was ""in tears"" on the second night of shooting. Smith also mentioned that there was an accident while filming the ""dirt bikes and four-wheel  off-road vehicles"" scene, with one child flying out of a vehicle and smashing his head, leaving him unconscious.  The video begins with Smith driving a vintage Austin-Healey 3000 sports car while a toddler points toy guns in Smith's direction. The car is then seen driving through a desert, this scene is intercut with the band performing the song in a studio. Smith parks the car at the Wheel Inn diner and makes a call from a telephone booth. The camera pans to show a statue of a man riding a horse nearby. Smith leaves the diner in the car while singing the song's lyrics. The following scene shows two black men in suits performing synchronised dance movements in front of two gas pumps. Shots of young people riding three-wheeled ATVs and dirt bikes through desert sand dunes are also shown. Smith is then shown singing in the desert wearing black sunglasses as many of the dirt bike and ATV riders approach from behind him and pass to either side.  The music video promoted the group in America, due to ""heavy rotation"" on the music video channel MTV. HuffPost editor Daryl Deino ranked the video at number three on their year-end list for best music videos of 1985 stating that the video ""represents pure Americana as it was in 1985"". Deino also mentioned that the video ""proves that at times, artists were able to do so much with so little.""  Formats and track listings  7"": Mercury / IDEA 9 (UK) A.

The reworked single was released in 1986 as the theme song for the Sport Aid campaign, a charitable event held to raise money for famine relief in Africa. It was a success in the UK Singles Chart, becoming the band's sixth top 5 hit, peaking at number 5 in June 1986. The song also reached number 4 in Ireland.  Lorde version  New Zealand singer Lorde recorded a cover of the song for the soundtrack of The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013). The cover was produced by Peter Shurkin and Natalie Baartz with arrangement by Michael A. Levine and Lucas Cantor. It was later used in the cinematic trailer of Assassin's Creed Unity at E3 2014, promotional videos for the BBC First network, and the 2015 BBC TV series Banished. It was also used during season 4 of Homeland. Orzabal praised Lorde for reinventing the cover, stating that the group finds it interesting when artists take what they do and reinterpret it. For their Rule the World Tour, the duo uses this version to launch their show.  Critics were positively receptive to the cover, some praised it for its darker atmosphere mood although others criticized it for stripping away the song's original upbeat composition. David Haglund from Slate stated that while the song ""doesn't top the great original, it does memorably reinvent it."" Sam Lansky from Idolator called the cover ""haunting and melodramatic"". Conversely, Stereogum editor Nate Patrin criticized the chorus and production but praised the ""aloof strangeness"" in Lorde's vocals for being able to carry the song ""past the usual Dramatic Reenvisionings."" Paste included the cover at number 8 on their 2013 year-end list for covers. Her cover appeared on the New Zealand Singles Chart at number 14. It reached number 53 in Australia, number 65 in the United Kingdom, number 93 in France, and number 27 on the US Hot Rock Songs chart.

Data Tutashkhia,"Data Tutashkhia () is a novel written by Chabua Amirejibi in 1975. It was translated to English by Antonina W. Bouis in 1985. This is one of the most popular readable novels in Georgia and former Soviet countries. The character is often compared to the English folklore hero Robin Hood .  About novel  The novel is a story of a Georgian outlaw of the Imperial Russian period, a very popular theme in Georgian literature, and combines thrilling escapades with Dostoevskian dealings with the fate of an individual and national soul. The story is narrated by a Russian gendarme, Count Szeged, who frequently passes the story-telling on to other characters. The novel follows the life of outlaw Data Tutashkhia, who spends years eluding capture by the Tsarist police. They are led by Data's cousin, his detached and imperturbable double, Mushni Zarandia. The book, and the feature film based on it, turned Data Tutaskhia into an iconic hero, widely popular in Georgia.  Plot and structure  The novel is divided into four parts chronicling its hero's, Data Tutashkhia's, moral evolution, always narrated from the perspective of a multitude of characters from  Tutashkhia's past. He is a man who from birth, can not stand injustice and wrongdoing. At the very beginning of the novel, we learn that he was convicted of an accidental killing that even the victim absolved him of! This then began his life as a fugitive, constantly running from police desperate to catch him. Throughout the novel, He goes from place to place, sees evil and struggles with how to overcome it. In the first part of the novel,  Tutashkhia attempts to help those wronged with little result, as either the individual wronged (strangely enough) continues to allow him/herself to be wronged (as in the case of the loser at cards continuing to allow himself to be cheated by card sharks); or the injured and insulted, once rescued by Data, start, themselves, to injure and insult (as was the case with the married pair whom  Tutashkhia assisted to purchase a cow). An excellent, memorable tale in this section of the novel was that of the hospital patients, whom he likened to the cannibal rats bred by one of the residents.   In the second part of the novel Data Tutashkhia, saddened by his previous experiences, decides not to intervene at all in societal issues unless absolutely certain that his actions would bring good. His new stance had the result of people forgetting all of his past good deeds, and turning on him for his 'indifference'.   In the third part of the novel, Tutashkhia, who has by this point lost his way, attempts to mingle in society in order to determine for himself a meaning and way forward in life. He joins the company of a lawyer and a mysterious woman and their little group engages in various philosophical debates over drinks (which it seems was/is a national pastime in Georgia!). This portion of the story was both interesting, in terms of the philosophical debates, and suspenseful The segment's climax, the dinner at the lawyer's home (with its 'mystery' guest), was particularly suspenseful and well written.  In the next section of the novel, Data Tutashkhia decides that evil can only be overcome by force. Here, we learn more about his cousin, who by this time, is one of the Russian imperial gendarme's 'best and brightest'. Completely -ahem- 'devoted' to his job and - ahem- ahem- 'unbiased', he zealously oversees a program to rid the region of 'dangerous' outlaws such as his cousin. It is in this section that we truly gain an understanding of which of the brothers really is the danger to society and the regime.  In the final part of the book,  Tutashkhia finally decides for himself, based on all of his past experiences, that the best way to rid the world of evil is to do good. This section of the novel features a gripping ending, as well as the final confrontation between Data and his family.

Ludolph Christian Treviranus,"Ludolph Christian Treviranus (September 18, 1779 in Bremen – May 6, 1864 in Bonn) was a German botanist born in Bremen. He was a younger brother to naturalist Gottfried Reinhold Treviranus (1776–1837).  In 1801 he earned his doctorate at the University of Jena, where he had as instructors; botanist August Batsch (1761–1802) and philosophers Friedrich Schelling (1775–1854) and Johann Gottlieb Fichte (1762–1814). In 1807 he was a professor at the Lyceum at Bremen, and in 1812 became a professor of natural history and botany at the University of Rostock, where he was also director of the botanical gardens. In 1816 he replaced Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link (1767–1851) as professor of botany at the University of Breslau, and in 1820 transferred to the University of Bonn, where he was successor to Christian Gottfried Daniel Nees von Esenbeck (1776–1858). Treviranus remained at Bonn until his death in 1864.  In his earlier studies, he worked mostly in the fields of plant anatomy and physiology, afterwards focusing on taxonomic issues. Between 1815 and 1828, he published noted works on the sexuality and embryology of phanerogams. He is credited for discovery of the intercellular space in a plant's parenchyma.  The botanical genus Trevirana (Gesneriaceae) was named in his honor by Carl Ludwig Willdenow (1765–1812).

Irma Schoennauer Cole,"Irma (Schoennauer) Cole (born as Irmgard Ida Ottilie Schoennauer; January 15, 1920 – November 6, 2003) was one of the United States’s premier swimmers in the late 1930s and early 1940s.  Born in Seattle, Washington, she was the daughter and eldest child of Chicago native, Arthur Charles John Schoennauer, and Prussian immigrant, Ida Amalia Ottilie Welk.  Irma’s father was a career typesetter employed by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer for most of his life; her mother was a seamstress and clothing designer.  As a teen, Irmgard attended Lincoln High School in Seattle, and graduated from the University of Washington in 1942 with a BA degree in Communications. As a freshman, she was a member of ""Chi of Phrateres,"" a philanthropic-social organization for female college students at the University.    Born the year female swimmers became the first American women to achieve full Olympic status, Irma began her competitive swimming career as a child at Green Lake in Seattle, having local swimming champion Helene Madison as her older role model.  Quickly recognized for her natural swimming ability and competitive spirit, Imgard was invited to join the swimming team of the Washington Athletic Club in 1935, soon winning numerous local, regional, statewide, and multi-state telegraph races, and was a member of the 400-yard relay team that won the National Championship in 1938.  Groomed to compete in 1940 Summer Olympics, she continued competitive swimming after the outbreak of World War II, even though the Olympic games were suspended by the IOC.  It is very likely, had it not been for the war, she would have competed on the United States Olympic swim team, possibly alongside peer, Esther Williams of California.    She made a career as a civil servant for the Federal Government for over 40 years; starting with the Department of the Interior at Mount Rainier National Park in Washington state after graduating from college, the Department of the War (Army & Air Force) in California during the latter part of World War II, and the Social Security Administration from about 1953 in various states, including California, Kansas, Maryland and finally Washington, where she retired about 1982.  Irma married Melvin Leroy Cole of Arkansas in 1955 in Ellensburg, Washington.  Because they both worked for the same government agency, after married they rarely resided in the same city.  Although two children were born of this union, partly as a result of this forced separation, they divorced in 1963.  Besides her lifelong interest in swimming, she enjoyed travelling by train (she never got a driver’s license, owned a car, or flew in a plane), investing in real estate, and researching her family history.  Irma died in Tacoma, Washington at the age of 83.  Her body was buried at Lake View Cemetery in Seattle, next to her beloved father.  Upon her death in 2003, she was survived by one of her brothers, her two sons, and one grandchild.

Asha Gond,"Asha Gond is an Indian skateboarder from Madhya Pradesh. She represented India in the 2018 World Skateboarding Championship and leads a non-profit organisation, Barefoot Skateboarders. The 2021 Netflix film, Skater Girl, is believed to be based on her life.  Early life and career Asha Gond was born to Dharmraj and Kamala Gond in the village of Janwar in Panna district in Madhya Pradesh to a family of farmers. Gond completed her high schooling from Manohar Kanya High School, Janwar and is an Adivasi. When Ulrike Reinhard came up with the idea and created the skatepark in the village in 2015, Gond was one of many children who began to learn and practice skateboarding. The students had no formal training and learned from YouTube videos. Due to the rules laid down by Reinhard, the children were not distracted from their studies, gave girls the first priority with the few skateboards available, and did not discriminate on the basis of caste. Gond still faced insults and threats from her fellow villagers, who believed that she should continue with the regressive traditions imposed on the women of the village.  In 2016, Reinhard helped crowdfund Gond's education in the English language at The Butler Centre for Education in Wantage, Oxfordshire, England, about  from Oxford. Gond had initially dropped out of school after Class XI. She became the first child in her village to travel abroad.  Gond also went on to participate in many national level skateboarding competitions and was India's only female skateboarder at the 2018 World Skateboarding Championship, held in Nanjing, China. She also co-founded and runs Barefoot Skateboarders, a non-profit organisation working to improve the education and development of the children in Janwar village. She has also been featured skateboarding in a TV advertisement for tyres.  Following the release of the trailer of Skater Girl, netizens familiar with the story of Reinhard and Gond found striking similarities between the movie and Gond's life. While Gond was interviewed as part of the production of the film, director Manjari Makijany denied that the movie was about Gond.

Based on the popular internet blog, the show includes intimate and candid conversations with strangers on the streets of New York City.  Production Stanton began production on the show in June 2014 and has amassed over 400 days worth of filming and interviewed more than 1,200 people. He made the decision to partner with Facebook after realizing that two-thirds of his audience lives outside the United States, and that Facebook has global reach unavailable most anywhere else.  Stanton partnered with documentary producer Julie Goldman on the series after she had screened some of the footage he had already shot.  Episodes  Reception Humans of New York: The Series has been met with a generally positive reception from critics upon its release. Vogue writer Mary Wang praised the show for revealing ""that plot twists aren’t the most important part of a good story—what matters are the humans behind it."" Margaret Lyons of The New York Times described the series in positive terms: ""It's poignancy on steroids, in that it’s very powerful..."" The Week critic Sarah Marshall compared the show favorably to the blog it's based upon when commenting that the series ""remains ephemeral, glancing, a flaneur's view of the city: people appearing, showing themselves to you, and then disappearing again."" In a more mixed review, Maeve Dunigan of the University of Maryland's independent school newspaper The Diamondback, mentioned that she wished the show had taken more risks and ""that Stanton had played with his idea a little more, allowing the videos to stand on their own without seeming like a direct copy of his former work.""

Grace Vamos,"Grace Becker Vamos (17 April 1898 – 25 March 1992) was an American cellist, composer, and educator.  Vamos grew up in Berkeley, California. Her mother played piano, her father played violin, and they hosted frequent chamber music sessions during her childhood. The family had an unused cello, which she learned how to play.  Vamos studied pedagogy at the Paris Conservatory with Andre Hekking, then received a Damrosch scholarship to remain in France and study at the Fontainebleau School of Music. She returned to California and taught cello and composition at Mills College, where she also studied composition with Domenico Brescia. In 1937, Vamos traveled to Hungary to study composition with Zoltan Kodaly. She left Hungary in 1939, as World War II began.  Vamos joined a string quartet in Mexico City, where her dance composition Dying Eagle was performed in the Opera House.  Her choral composition Praise Ye the Lord was performed by the Bach Choral Society of Mexico City. Vamos returned to San Francisco where the Oakland Symphony performed her piano concerto in the premiere performance of a piano concerto by a female composer in the state of California.  In 1948, Vamos married Ernest Vamos, a Hungarian immigrant to the United States.  He was an amateur cellist and a dentist. She formed the Trio Moderne with flutist Christine Howells Pfund and harpist Marie Hughes Marguarrie, which performed frequently, often playing arrangements by Vamos.  Vamos received the Sigma Alpha Iota Award for her Suite for Cello and Piano, which Pablo Casals praised in a letter to her in 1960, saying  “I have had much pleasure in reading your composition which shows real talent.” She received the Harp Association Award for Legends of the Redwood.   Vamos endowed several scholarships and awards: the Grace Becker Vamos Scholarship for promising young cellists in 1975; the Grace Vamos Scholarship Trust and the Ernest Vamos Memorial Scholarship at Holy Names College (now Holy Names University) in 1981; and the Grace Vamos National Cello Competition in 1990.

NS (Sons of Anarchy),"""NS"" is the thirteenth and final episode of the third season of the FX television series Sons of Anarchy. It was written and directed by Kurt Sutter, the original series creator and co-written by Dave Erickson. It originally aired in the United States on November 30, 2010.  This episode marks the last appearance of Ally Walker (Agent June Stahl), Paula Malcomson (Maureen Ashby) and Titus Welliver as (James 'Jimmy' O'Phelan)  Plot Salazar takes Tara to Jacob Hale's office, where he takes Hale hostage as well. When he gives his list of demands, one of them is for Jax to come to Hale's office. Tara sees Salazar pull out a knife, and he tells her he plans to kill her while Jax watches and then kill Jax. As Jax enters the office, Salazar is about to kill Tara, but Jacob Hale stabs him instead. Jax wrestles the gun from Salazar, gives it to Tara, and tells her to kill anyone who is not a cop. When the whole ordeal is over with Jax and Tara go to the doctor for an ultrasound to make sure the baby was not harmed. The baby is healthy and Jax and Tara hear the heartbeat and see the baby on the ultrasound. Jax and Tara then go to Gemma's house where Gemma hugs her. Tara sees Abel and happily holds him and welcomes him back home. In the season finale, Tara has become more involved with the club. She drives Jimmy O back to the garage in the trunk after SAMCRO buys him from the Russians. Jax makes sure that she wears a bulletproof vest to ensure her safety in case something goes wrong. When Stahl tells the club about the deal Jax made with her, which was actually a trap by the club to kill Stahl and Jimmy, she runs and hugs him distraught and fearing that the club will kill him in prison. With the help of Unser, Chibs Telford kills Jimmy O'Phelan in retribution for stealing his wife and daughter many years ago, before Opie forces a terrified Stahl in the front seat of the cop car. During this confrontation Stahl breaks down crying and begs Opie for her life, to which Opie responds, ""This is what she felt."" He then shoots Stahl in the back of the head with a MAC-10, instantly killing her, to avenge the death of his wife Donna. After this, Chibs rigs the scene to look as if the real IRA murdered Stahl and Jimmy. Tara reads letters from John Teller to his mistress Maureen Ashby, implying that Gemma and Clay would be responsible for his death should it happen. The rest of SAMCRO, enroute to prison, celebrate their victory over Jimmy and Stahl.  Reception IGN voted Agent Stahl's death #10 in their list of the biggest deaths, They said: ""The ending of Season 3 was one of the more gratifying twists the show ever had. Things seemed bleak when Agent Stahl informed the club that Jax had made a deal and ratted them out. But what she didn’t know was that it was all a setup, one that ended with her dead as Opie got his revenge for her setting him up and getting his wife killed. The season ended on an unexpectedly up note as Clay and Jax smiled and the rest of the guys in the prison van shared a laugh. Sure they were on their way to prison, but Jax wasn’t a rat and Stahl was out of the picture for good.""  Zach Handler of The A.V. Club gave ""NS"" an A- rating, stating; ""What worked the best about 'NS' and what allows me to be optimistic about next season's potential, even while having largely mixed feelings on this season overall, is the ending. The episode doesn't manage to make all the IRA stuff feel organic, and Hal Holbrook doesn't pop back in to remind us about that basically innocent housekeeper that got murdered a while back, but it does introduce a new threat to the Sons, and, unlike Cameron and his Disappearing Baby Trick, this threat fits in beautifully with the context of the show overall. Maureen smuggled John's letters to her in Jax's backpack, and Tara found them. Reading them, while Jax and Clay grin at each other in triumph and while Gemma sits with her grandson in her arms, propped up like a queen on her throne, we hear Teller's voice-over again. It's long been hinted at that Clay and Gemma had something to do with John's death. This is a Hamlet riff, after all. And now Tara, the outsider who finally found her way to belonging, has reason to be suspicious. Makes you wonder what else is in those letters. And it makes you wonder what Jax'll do if he reads them.""

Battle for Cebu City,"The Battle for Cebu City (Filipino: Labanan sa Lungsod ng Cebu; Cebuano: Gubat sa Dakbayan sa Sugbo; Japanese: セブシティーのための戦い) was a major engagement of World War II that occurred between March 26 and April 8, 1945, during the second Philippines Campaign. The battle resulted in an Allied victory over the occupying Japanese Army and the liberation of Cebu City.  Prelude  After launching their campaign to recapture the Philippines at Leyte in October 1944, the Allies followed up that victory by dispatching troops to Luzon in January 1945. A month later, General Douglas MacArthur, overall commander of Allied forces in the Pacific, began planning to take the rest of the Philippines. General Robert L. Eichelberger's Eighth Army was then tasked with conducting a series of amphibious landings in the southern Philippines on islands between Mindanao and Luzon, including Cebu. Prior to the war, Cebu had been the Philippines second-most important industrial center, and it offered the Allies a harbor for future operations.  The island was garrisoned by a force of between 14,500 and 15,000 Japanese troops. These were situated mainly in Cebu City and on the central east coast. Drawn from the 35th Army, the majority of these troops were support troops who had been supporting the evacuation of Luzon, and who were formed into combat units. The main Japanese combat units were the 102nd Infantry Division, which consisted of the 78th Infantry Brigade headquarters and the 173d Independent Infantry Battalion, and 1st Division, consisting of the 1st, 49th and 57th Infantry Regiments, which were down to battalion strength due to earlier fighting on Luzon. There were also several naval garrison units on the island, including the 33rd Special Base Force and the 36th Guard Unit.  Battle   Following a preliminary bombardment, the battle began on March 26, 1945, when the Allies launched Operation Victor II. Staging out of Leyte, where they had conducted rehearsal landings two days earlier, a large flotilla of cruisers and destroyers from the Seventh Fleet Task Force 74 escorted the Cebu Attack Group to the island. Under the leadership of Major General William H. Arnold, the forces assigned to the operation consisted of the Americal Division's 132nd and 182nd Infantry Regiments, totaling about 5,000 men, were landed on Cebu island at Talisay Beach,  southwest of Cebu City. The 182nd came ashore southwest of the city, while the 132nd landed at a wide gravel beach to the northeast opposite a palm grove. Meeting no Japanese opposition, the U.S. forces nevertheless suffered heavily from mines and booby traps as they crossed the beach. It was the first time in the Philippines campaign that U.S. troops had encountered such weapons.  As further waves landed, engineers and infantry began clearing lanes through the mine fields. The Americal Division slowly forced its way off the beach and moved inland against only small pockets of Japanese resistance that were carrying out delaying actions. The main body stopped for the night about  from Cebu City. Patrols were sent out and the following day, the Americal Division continued its advance towards Cebu City, tasked with securing the harbor and nearby airfield, Lahug Airfield, positioned  northeast of the city. On March 28, more significant fighting broke out as the Americans captured the airfield, as well as Mactan Island in Cebu Harbor. Although the city had been officially liberated, Japanese forces remained in many parts, including the port area, and occupied several strongly defended positions in the hills to the city's north, where they came under the command of Major-General Takeo Manjome, who had previously commanded the 78th Infantry Brigade. At this time, Japanese resistance grew more determined and heavy fighting followed.  Around 8,500 local Cebuano guerrilla and irregular forces, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel James M. Cushing took part . Units fought on the outskirts of Cebu, capturing Pari-an on March 29 and liberating T. Padilla on April 7. As Allied morale heightened and Japanese forces withdrew to the ports, the U.S. naval commander, Ferdinand Ernest Zuellig, directed naval bombardments on the ports, prompting the Japanese to withdraw to Fort San Pedro. Many did not make it and were trapped within Piers One and Two.  Although the final operations around the ports were successful and forced many Japanese to surrender, the Japanese headquarters unit in charge of the area made a final stand near the border of Mandaue City. Led by Major Rijome Kawahara, after further fighting these forces were defeated, and after that the Allies gained control of the remaining areas of the city as Kawahara's remaining troops withdrew. Kawahara was killed while trying to cross the makeshift bridge towards Mandaue City. Reportedly, he was killed by a sniper after being incapacitated by mortar and tank fire. Kawahara was posthumously promoted to the rank of colonel.  After the war, his body was returned to Japan where it was buried in Sapporo, the city of his birth.  Aftermath  During the final stages of the battle, the mountainous parts of Cebu were also bombed and cleared. A series of battles were subsequently fought during this time, the most famous of which is the Battle of Gochan Hill, fought over three days from March 29. Battling against a heavily entrenched force, the fighting proved costly for the 182d Infantry Regiment, with one company losing over 50 men killed when the Japanese blew up an ammunition dump, before the U.S. forces finally took the hill, having destroyed at least 85 pillboxes.  Supported by naval gunfire, the Americal Division attempted to break through the Japanese line through a frontal assault, but their attempts resulted in slow progress, so plans were made to outflank them. In early April two battalions from the Americal Division's third regiment, the 164th, were dispatched to Cebu as reinforcements. These were moved in great secrecy around the Japanese lines and on 13 April, the Americans put in a two-pronged divisional level attack, which although initially checked, eventually forced the Japanese commander, Manjome, to withdraw further north into the mountains. Meanwhile, on April 20 the 164th Infantry's third battalion landed on the island of Bohol, and in concert with Filipino troops and guerillas began clearance operations, before being moved to Negros on April 20; they were subsequently joined by the regiment's other two battalions on 25 April.  On Cebu, after a brief pause, the Allied forces began to follow up the retreating Japanese on April 20. Filipino troops and Cebuano guerillas continued harassment operations. The Americal Division ceased operations on June 20, when they withdrew to Cebu City to begin preparations for future operations. Meanwhile, the guerillas continued to keep pressure on the remaining Japanese. The entire Cebu campaign ended on July 2, after Camp 8 had fallen. The Americans subsequently developed a large logistics base on the island, Base 'S', which was intended to be used by three infantry divisions as a staging base for the proposed invasion of Japan.  Around 5,550 Japanese were killed during the fighting, while the Americal Division lost 410 men killed and 1,700 wounded; a further 8,000 U.S. troops became sick during the battle. The Filipino forces under the Philippine Commonwealth Army and Philippine Constabulary lost about 3,600 killed and 6,200 wounded. About 8,500 Japanese were able to escape into Cebu's north, where they remained until the war ended in August.  Controversy  A number of controversies surround this battle. The most famous is why General Sosaku Suzuki, commander of the IJA 35th Army which was responsible for the forces on Cebu, was not in command of the Japanese troops in the city and where he was during the height of the battle. One theory that has developed is that during the liberation of the city on March 27, Suzuki had already fled to the hills and mountains of Cebu City, hoping to make a last stand against the invading joint US and Philippine forces, resulting in the Battle of Gochan Hill. His orders for the defense of the city are believed to have been formulated earlier and the plan was made was given to Kawahara who, at that time, was the highest-ranking Japanese officer in the city, was entrusted with defending the city to the last man standing. As the mountainous parts of Cebu were being cleared by Allied forces, so too were the city outposts and barangays. When Suzuki transferred to the IJA garrison in the Cadulawan-Tubod area around Minglanilla, after fleeing from the destroyed mountain camps, on April 8, 1945, he received a mail that Kawahara had been killed while defending the city, and that the whole city, its ports and the nearby barangays had been captured by the Allies. Because of this, he began planning his escape.  On April 14, 1945, the Allies began an assault on the Japanese bases in the Cadulawan-Tubod area, as well the elimination of the defenses set up by the IJA in Pungtod, Calajo-an, and the Port of Tulay-Tungkop in what later became known as the ""Battle of Minglanilla"" and the ""Defense of Calajo-an"". Spearheaded by US troops from 'G' Company, 182nd Infantry Regiment and some local soldiers from the Philippine Commonwealth military and Cebuano guerrillas, the battle lasted for two days, clearing the IJA from Minglanilla. To care for the wounded, Allied forces set-up four wards, called Allied Service Stations and Mobile Allied Service hospitals, in the area and this is the reason why today there are barangays in Minglanilla named Poblacion Ward I to Ward 4.  The first stronghold, Camp 7, was cleared on April 15, but the bastion, Camp 8, was not cleared until July 2, marking the liberation of the entire Cebu from the Japanese. By the time the battle was at its height on April 10, Suzuki fled south in an effort to avoid capture and rejoin the main part of his command on Mindanao, in the southern Philippines. On April 19, while sailing in a convoy of small ships, Suzuki was killed when the ship he was in was attacked by U.S. aircraft between Sumilon Island Sound and Santander Bay.

2018 Major League Baseball Home Run Derby,"The 2018 Major League Baseball Home Run Derby was a home run hitting contest between eight batters from Major League Baseball (MLB). The derby was held on July 16, 2018, at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C., the site of the 2018 MLB All-Star Game. On July 11, the participants were announced. Bryce Harper was the winner, as he beat Kyle Schwarber, in the final 19–18, winning the derby in front of his hometown crowd. He tied Schwarber on the last pitch as time expired in regulation; then won it with 16 seconds left in bonus time.  Rules Eight players participate in the derby in a bracket-style, single-elimination timed event. Each player has four minutes to hit as many home runs as possible. Hitters are awarded an additional 30 seconds if they hit two home runs over . Hitters are also allowed one 45 second timeout to stop the clock (two in the finals). Homers hit off a T-Mobile Ball during the final minute result in a $10,000 donation to charity by T-Mobile & MLB, to Team Rubicon.  The eight competing players are seeded 1-8 based on their home run totals. While the lower seed hits first, the higher seed hits second in all rounds. The round ends if the higher seed exceeds the total of the first hitter. In the event of a tie, three sets of tiebreakers are employed: first, a 90-second swing-off (with no timeouts nor bonus time awarded); second, each player gets three swings; whoever hits more home runs in the three swings will be declared the winner; thereafter, sudden death swings will occur until the tie is broken.

Max Brito,"Max Brito (born 8 April 1971 in Abidjan, Ivory Coast) is a former rugby union player on the Ivory Coast rugby team. As a result of injuries sustained at the 1995 Rugby World Cup in South Africa, he was paralysed. As of 2007 he could only move his head, torso, and an arm.  Career  Brito played as a winger, and spent his career playing for Biscarrosse Olympique in the Fédérale 3 division of French rugby. An electrician by trade, he was noticeable on the field for his long dreadlocks as well as his brave play. Brito was called into the Ivorian national team squad for the 1995 Rugby World Cup. Brito came on as a substitute in the opening game against Scotland which the Ivory Coast lost by 89 points to nil, a result which led many to question the inclusion of ""minor"" teams in the tournament. He played again in the second game for Les Elephants, who put in a vastly improved performance against France, despite losing 54–18.  Injury  Brito started Ivory Coast's third match against Tonga on 3 June. He caught a high ball that had been kicked up the field, and set off on a counter-attack. He was tackled by Inoke Afeaki, the Tonga flanker, before a ruck formed over him. The ruck collapsed and several players fell on top of Brito, leaving him prone and motionless on the ground. Brito was taken to the intensive care unit of the Unitas Hospital in Pretoria with broken vertebrae.  Operations were carried out to stabilize the fourth and fifth vertebrae, but Brito was left paralysed below the neck.	  After the accident, Brito was given treatment and compensation, which was funded by all sides competing at the 1995 Rugby World Cup. Nevertheless, in 2007, it was reported that Brito was still largely unable to move, being bedridden most of the time, with only some limited movement in his chest and arms. He and his wife have separated, whilst he has little contact with his sons, and he now lives with his parents in Bordeaux. There has been some criticism of how his case was handled, after the initial support: Damian Hopley, Head of the Professional Rugby Players' Association, said in 2003, ""We became involved in money-raising events for Max ... but there was very little support for him from Rugby World Cup.""    In his 2007 interview, Brito was portrayed as living an unhappy life. He was quoted as saying: ""It is now 12 years since I have been in this state. I have come to the end of my tether... If one day I fall seriously ill, and if I have the strength and courage to take my own life, then I will do it...This bloody handicap - it's my curse. It kills me and I will never accept it. I can't live with it and it's going to be with me for the rest of my life.""  But in 2020, in an interview with i, he revealed he had undergone a spiritual transformation that had helped him cope with his disability.  ""I would say there were 13 or 14 years of fog where I didn't know where I was. The accident was very violent. But after that I had a spiritual enlightenment and I understood that it was necessary to accept my handicap. And from that moment on, all the doors were open.""

James Gisborne,"James Gisborne (died 1778) was a British Army officer and Member of the Irish Parliament.  Biography He was the son of James Gisborne, rector of Staveley, Derbyshire; Thomas Gisborne was his younger brother. He went to Ireland as page to the Duke of Devonshire, and had a successful career in the viceregal household. On 1 June 1739 he joined the Army with a commission as second lieutenant in Bissett's Regiment of Foot, and after a progressive service in the subordinate commissions, he was appointed lieutenant-colonel of the 10th Regiment in 1755, and was afterwards employed many years on the staff of Ireland, as quartermaster-general in that country.   In 1762 Gisborne was promoted to the rank of colonel of Foot, with command of the 121st Regiment, and on 4 March 1766 he was removed to the 16th Regiment. In 1770 Gisborne was persuaded by Lord Townshend to resign his post as quartermaster-general in favour of Simon Fraser, and was compensated with the sinecure of Governor of Kinsale. However, the government of Kinsale was then required for the outgoing adjutant-general, Robert Cuninghame, and Gisborne was granted a pension of £500 per annum until another government of greater value should become vacant; he was later appointed Governor of Charlemont. Gisborne was promoted to major-general in 1770, and to lieutenant-general in 1777.   Besides his military career, Gisborne was Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod from September 1757, and sat in the Irish House of Commons for Tallow from 1763 to 1768, and for Lismore from 1768 until his death on 20 February 1778.

Great Naval Battles: North Atlantic 1939-1943,"Great Naval Battles: North Atlantic 1939–1943 was the first game in the Great Naval Battles series, published in 1992 for DOS.  Gameplay Great Naval Battles: North Atlantic 1939–1943 was released in 1992 and depicts naval warfare in the North Atlantic during World War 2.  Reception Computer Gaming Worlds reviewer in January 1993 stated that North Atlantic 1939–1943 was the first computer game to replicate ""that 'joy of miniatures'"". He cited several flaws in the gameplay but concluded that ""for all the problems ... there are a half-dozen very nice features. For every minor disappointment there seem to be several glitzy positives. Frankly, I'm spending a lot of time playing it"". A September 1993 review in the magazine of America in the Atlantic, Super Ships of the Atlantic, and Scenario Builder praised the latter's ""infinite"" replayability from the latter's random engagements, and stated that ""SSI's efforts in refining and expanding this series are to be commended ... it has the potential of becoming the recognized placebo for practictioners of historical naval combat in this theater"".

Tattooed Serpent,"Tattooed Serpent (died 1725) (Natchez: Obalalkabiche; French: Serpent Piqué) was the war chief of the Natchez people of Grand Village, which was located near Natchez in what is now the U.S. state of Mississippi. He and his brother, the paramount chief Great Sun, allied his people with the French colonists. He was a friend of the colonist and chronicler Antoine-Simon Le Page du Pratz. Du Pratz described their friendship and Tattooed Serpent's death and funeral in detail in his chronicle.  Source of the name The name Obalalkabiche (Tattooed Serpent) was traditionally adopted by the War Chief of the Natchez, who was always the younger brother of the Paramount Chief, whose official name was Yak-stalchil (Great Sun). Thus, the Tattooed Serpent who died in 1725 and was a friend of Du Pratz was preceded by his own maternal uncle (died 1700), who was also called Tattooed Serpent while in office. On his death in 1725, Tattooed Serpent was succeeded by his sister's second eldest son, who took the same name. As an emblem of the office, he was decorated with the elaborate tattoo of a serpent circling his body from his foot to his mouth.  Life In 1723, Tattooed Serpent helped the French negotiate a peace treaty after the Second Natchez War 1723, which ended the attacks on the French by the Natchez of the White Apple Village. He was such a friend of the French that, according to the chronicle of Dumont de Montigny, his sister, called La Glorieuse by the French, said that ""he was like a Frenchman"".  At his death, he and his older brother were both succeeded by much younger men. The alliance between the French and the Natchez became unstable, as the leaders of the pro-British White Apple village gained influence. This eventually led to the Natchez Massacre of 1729, and the end of amiable relations between the French and the Natchez.  Death and funeral  Le Page du Pratz describes in great detail the events surrounding the death of Tattooed Serpent, including his funeral. When he died, his brother, the Paramount Chief Great Sun, was so grief-stricken that he wanted to follow his brother in death by suicide. Le Page du Pratz managed to prevent the Great Sun from doing so.  At the funeral of Tattooed Serpent, a number of commoner class servants of the War Chief were sacrificed by garrotting, following the Natchez custom. According to du Pratz, two of his wives, one of his sisters (La Glorieuse), his first warrior, his doctor, his head servant and the servant's wife, his nurse, and a craftsman of war clubs all chose to die and be interred with him, as well as several old women. An infant was sacrificed, strangled by his parents. These retainers had their faces painted red and were drugged with large doses of nicotine or Jimson weed before their deaths.  During the funeral procession, the chief's body was carried to the temple on a litter made of cane matting and cedar poles. The temple was located on top of a low platform mound. The retainers were ritually strangled at the temple.  Tattooed Serpent was buried in a trench inside the temple floor, while his retainers were buried in other locations atop the mound surrounding the temple. After a few months time, the bodies were disinterred and their defleshed bones were stored as bundle burials in the temple.

The following year, he fought another battle against them which ended inconclusively.   After this defeat, he made peace with Sweyn and married one of his daughters Gytha to his eldest son Edward the Confessor.   During his reign there were also several Viking raids into southern England including those of Olaf Trygvasson and his fleet in 1094-95.  In 1100, he abdicated in favour of his son Edward the Confessor because of ill health or possibly due to pressure from nobles unhappy over his rule.

Arachniotus ruber,"Arachniotus ruber is a species of fungus belonging to the genus Arachniotus in the family Gymnoascaceae. This fungus is a mesophile that reproduces both sexually and asexually. So far, there have been no reports of the fungus being pathogenic.  History and taxonomy Arachniotus ruber was first described by Philippe Édouard Léon Van Tieghem in 1877 and it was thought to belong to the genus, Gymnoascus, due to similarities he observed in the gametangial initials. It was not until 1893 that Schroeter transferred the species to his recently established genus, Arachniotus, due to it possessing many of the corresponding traits. At the time, Schroeter did not designate a type species for the genus, which resulted in some debate until a lectotype, A. candidus, was eventually identified by Clements and Shear in 1931. With this change, A. ruber was excluded from the Arachniotus genus because it did not display type characteristics within its ascospores (3). Consequently, Orr, Ghosh, and Roy moved the species to the genus, Pseudoarachniotus, in 1977.  Morphology Arachniotus ruber have discrete ascomata present, usually confluent and mostly spherical, measuring 20-200 μm and are red, orange, and brown in colour. Asci of A. ruber are ovoid, hyaline, and measure 10-13 x 7-10 μm. The ascospores of A. ruber are smooth, spherical, and vary in colour between red, orange, and yellow. They have an equatorial groove along the longitudinal axis, giving them a shape similar to that of a pulley wheel, and they measure 2.8-4.4 x 4-6.6 μm. Asexual spore states of A. ruber are represented by hyaline arthroaleuriospores measuring 8-30 x 2.2–3.3 μm.  Habitat and ecology Arachniotus ruber has been found in the excrement of various animals, with the majority of samples being obtained in the United Kingdom and Germany. Van Tiegham first observed the species within dog and rat dung in France. Schroeter obtained samples of the species from dog and goat dung in Germany. There is also an occurrence of the species being found in hawk pellets by Dr. Arvids E. Apinis at the University of Nottingham in 1958. Another instance of A. ruber was found in a cave in Spain.  Preparation and cultivation In order to sporulate under laboratory conditions, Arachniotus ruber is most commonly grown on freezing agar, which is a medium prepared using potatoes, agar, glucose, yeast extract, and activated carbon. As A. ruber grows on this medium, it will initially form white hyphae that will turn orange red and the colonies are pasty with occasional concentric rings of mycelium. The species has been observed to grow at 30 °C and show no further signs of growth at 37 °C.  Usage and applications There have been very few studies that delve into the potential applications of Arachniotus ruber. One study done in 2016 displayed the potential of A. ruber being used to increase the nutritional value of wheat straw. Another, more recent study from 2019 investigated the species’ usefulness in combatting malnutrition in developing countries. The study goes into detail about how malnutrition stems from protein deficiency, and performed an experiment using A. ruber. The experiment used dry banana peels as a basis for the substrate and prepared A. ruber in media, autoclaving the two together under various conditions. After some processing, the resulting feed was consumed by broiler chicks. The results of a proximate analysis showed that A. ruber was able to increase the nutritional value of the resulting biomass protein, showing potential in this area of research.

Einar Englund,"Sven Einar Englund (June 17, 1916 – June 27, 1999) was a Finnish composer.  Life Sven Einar Englund was born at Ljugarn in Gotland, Sweden, on June 17, 1916; he died June 27, 1999 in Visby, Sweden. He married twice: in 1941 to Meri Mirjam Gyllenbögel, who died 1956 (they had one son and two daughters including the ballerina and choreographer Sorella Englund); and in 1958 he married Maynie Sirén, a singer, with whom he had one son.  One of the most important Finnish symphonists since Jean Sibelius, Englund was a native Swedish speaker who often felt that his career was sidelined from the mainstream of Finnish music.  He went to Svenska normallyceum i Helsingfors and was 17 when he began studies at the Helsinki Conservatory (now the Sibelius Academy) in 1933. Already a considerable pianist, he continued his studies with Martti Paavola and Ernst Linko while studying composition with Bengt Carlson and Selim Palmgren.   Following his graduation in 1941, Englund was conscripted into military service. During his time in the Finnish Continuation War he was wounded in his hand, which almost brought to an end his hopes of pursuing a career as a concert pianist. He would often recall the bizarre, though life-threatening incident, with a smile.  Music Englund's first work for large orchestra was his First Symphony (1946), which became known as the ""War Symphony"". This was no apprentice piece; the use of counterpoint, dissonance and orchestration of singular clarity reveals a master at work. His Second Symphony, the ""Blackbird Symphony"", soon followed the first.  In 1949 Englund was awarded a grant to study in the United States with Aaron Copland, and he also played jazz with Leonard Bernstein. It has been suggested that Englund's study with the American master consisted of discussions about music and composition, Copland having realised that there was little he could teach the younger man.  Throughout the 1950s he produced a series of large-scale works including Sinuhe, a ballet  (1953) originally for piano though later orchestrated, and Odysseus (1959), written for the Swedish dancer and choreographer Birgit Cullberg, a Cello Concerto (1954) and the First Piano Concerto (1955), as well as film scores and incidental music. His score for Erik Blomberg’s Valkoinen peura (The White Reindeer), which won a Jussi Award (the Finnish Oscar), and his score for Max Frisch’s play The Great Wall of China are particularly notable.  He composed music for twenty films, as well as works for choir including the Hymnus Sepulcralis (1975).  During the 1950s, with his second wife, the singer Maynie Sirén, he performed a cabaret act; he was music critic of the Swedish-language Hufvudstadsbladet, and he taught at the Sibelius Academy from 1958 until 1982.  His Third Symphony (1971) appeared 23 years after his second and signalled his return to composition; he had written only a few works during the 1960s. There soon followed his Fourth (1976) and Fifth Symphonies (1977) and the Concerto for Twelve Cellos (1981).  Englund’s Sixth Symphony (1984), subtitled Aphorisms, is in six movements for chorus and orchestra; his last symphony, the Seventh, was composed in 1988, coinciding with the onset of the heart disease that signalled a decline in health and would ultimately lead to his death. His Clarinet Concerto of 1991 was completed shortly before a stroke rendered further composition physically impossible. Later he suffered from kidney failure, which necessitated dialysis for the remainder of his life.  Englund also composed chamber music, including a suite for solo cello and a sonata for cello and piano; there are also works for violin and piano, solo trombone, and solo piano.  His memoirs, I Skuggan av Sibelius (In the Shadow of Sibelius), were published in 1997. His work was also part of the music event in the art competition at the 1948 Summer Olympics.

East Kew railway station,"East Kew was a railway station on the Outer Circle railway line, located in the suburb of Kew, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. The station opened with the line on 24 March 1891, and closed with the line on 12 April 1893. It was located on the west side of Normanby Road, and was the site of a crossing loop with a platform on each track. A goods siding was also provided at the Riversdale end.  The station was reopened on 11 February 1925, for goods traffic only, and was the terminus of the reopened section of the Outer Circle line from Deepdene railway station. Three loop sidings were provided, along with a headshunt, and there was a dead end extension at the Riversdale end. The headshunt, which crossed Normanby Road, was abolished in about 1935 to eliminate the level crossing, and the sidings became dead-end. Goods services were withdrawn on 6 September 1943, and the line back to Riversdale closed.

Lillias Margaret Skene,"Lillias Margaret Skene,  (née Hamilton; 28 March 186725 March 1957) was an Australian women's rights activist.  Early life Lillias Hamilton was born on 28 March 1867 in Smythesdale, Victoria, Australia, the third child of Scottish-born police magistrate John Prendergast Hamilton and his English-vbrn wife Agnes Margaret (née Buchanan). Hamilton attended the local Alexandra College in Hamilton. On 7 November 1888 at St Mary's Anglican Church in Caulfield, she married 33-year-old sheepmaster David Alexander Skene.  Career Straddled in debt, Hamilton's husband had to seek employment in New South Wales, while she and her children remained in Hamilton. In 1900 the family moved to Manly, Sydney, where they ran a modest dairy farm. In 1906, they moved to Melbourne and her husband began selling wool. The family purchased a property in South Yarra in 1910.  Unable to make the second payment on the property he was buying when the banks collapsed in the early 1890s, David was forced to work as a station-manager in New South Wales. Lillias and their children stayed at Hamilton. They rejoined him at Curraweena station, near Bourke, in 1896 before moving to Glenariff and then in 1900 to Manly, Sydney. There they invested in a small dairy and leased 25 acres (10 ha). In the face of drought and the high cost of fodder, they sold out in 1906 and moved to Melbourne, where David set up as a woolbroker and stock-and-station agent. In 1910, with money inherited from her mother, Lillias acquired a house for the family at South Yarra.  Skene was the assistant-secretary of the National Council of Women of Victoria (Victorian NCW). In 1915, she became the honorary manager and storekeeper of the Melbourne-based Home Hospital situated in the Government House. In 1909, she was appointed as the honorary secretary of the Women's Hospital Committee's board of management.  Final years She retired from most of her commitments in 1949 and moved to Brighton. Skene died on 25 March 1957 in Armadale and was buried at the Brighton cemetery.  Skene Street, in the Canberra suburb of Cook, is named in her honour.

Haplogroup L3 (mtDNA),"Haplogroup L3 is a human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroup. The clade has played a pivotal role in the early dispersal of anatomically modern humans.  It is strongly associated with the out-of-Africa migration of modern humans of about 70–50,000 years ago. It is inherited by all modern non-African populations, as well as by some populations in Africa.  Origin   Haplogroup L3 arose close to 70,000 years ago, near the time of the recent out-of-Africa event. This dispersal originated in East Africa and expanded to West Asia, and further to South and Southeast Asia in the course of a few millennia, and some research suggests that L3 participated in this migration out of Africa. A 2007 estimate for the age of L3 suggested a range of 104–84,000 years ago. More recent analyses, including Soares et al. (2012) arrive at a more recent date, of roughly 70–60,000 years ago. Soares et al. also suggest that L3 most likely expanded from East Africa into Eurasia sometime around 65–55,000 years ago years ago as part of the recent out-of-Africa event, as well as from East Africa into Central Africa from 60 to 35,000 years ago. In 2016, Soares et al. again suggested that haplogroup L3 emerged in East Africa, leading to the Out-of-Africa migration, around 70–60,000 years ago.  Haplogroups L6 and L4 form sister clades of L3 which arose in East Africa at roughly the same time but which did not participate in the out-of-Africa migration. The ancestral clade L3'4'6 has been estimated at 110 kya, and the L3'4 clade at 95 kya.  The possibility of an origin of L3 in Asia was also proposed by Cabrera et al. (2018) based on the similar coalescence dates of L3 and its Eurasian-distributed M and N derivative clades (ca. 70 kya), the distant location in Southeast Asia of the oldest known subclades of M and N, and the comparable age of the paternal haplogroup DE. According to this hypothesis, after an initial out-of-Africa migration of bearers of pre-L3 (L3'4*) around 125 kya, there would have been a back-migration of females carrying L3 from Eurasia to East Africa sometime after 70 kya. The hypothesis suggests that this back-migration is aligned with bearers of  paternal haplogroup E, which it also proposes to have originated in Eurasia. These new Eurasian lineages are then suggested to have largely replaced the old autochthonous male and female North-East African lineages.  According to other research, though earlier migrations out of Africa of anatomically modern humans occurred, current Eurasian populations descend instead from a later migration from Africa dated between about 65,000 and 50,000 years ago (associated with the migration out of L3).  Vai et al. (2019) suggest, from a newly discovered old and deeply-rooted branch of maternal haplogroup N found in early Neolithic North African remains, that haplogroup L3 originated in East Africa between 70,000 and 60,000 years ago, and both spread within Africa and left Africa as part of the Out-of-Africa migration, with haplogroup N diverging from it soon after (between 65,000 and 50,000 years ago) either in Arabia or possibly North Africa, and haplogroup M originating in the Middle East around the same time as N.  A study by Lipson et al. (2019) analyzing remains from the Cameroonian site of Shum Laka found them to be more similar to modern-day Pygmy peoples than to West Africans, and suggests that several other groups (including the ancestors of West Africans, East Africans and the ancestors of non-Africans) commonly derived from a human population originating in East Africa between about 80,000-60,000 years ago, which they suggest was also the source and origin zone of haplogroup L3 around 70,000 years ago.<ref>Ancient Human DNA from Shum Laka (Cameroon) in the Context of African Population History, by Lipson Mark et al., 2019</ref>   Distribution   L3 is common in Northeast Africa and some other parts of East Africa, in contrast to others parts of Africa where the haplogroups L1 and L2 represent around two thirds of mtDNA lineages. L3 sublineages are also frequent in the Arabian peninsula.  L3 is subdivided into several clades, two of which spawned the macrohaplogroups M and N that are today carried by most people outside Africa. There is at least one relatively deep non-M, non-N clade of L3 outside Africa, L3f1b6, which is found at a frequency of 1% in Asturias, Spain. It diverged from African L3 lineages at least 10,000 years ago.  According to Maca-Meyer et al. (2001), ""L3 is more related to Eurasian haplogroups than to the most divergent African clusters L1 and L2"". L3 is the haplogroup from which all modern humans outside Africa derive. However, there is a greater diversity of major L3 branches within Africa than outside of it, the two major non-African branches being the L3 offshoots M and N.   Subclade distribution   L3 has seven equidistant descendants: L3a, L3b'f, L3c'd, L3e'i'k'x, L3h, M, N. Five are African, while two are associated with the Out of Africa event.  N – Eurasia possibly due to migration from Africa, and North Africa possibly due to back-migration from Eurasia.  M – Asia, the Mediterranean Basin, and parts of Africa due to back-migration.  L3a – East Africa. Moderate to high frequencies found among the Sanye, Samburu, Iraqw, Yaaku, El-Molo and other minor indigenous populations from the East African Rift Valley. It is infrequent to nonexistent in Sudan and the Sahel zone.  L3a1 – Found across Eastern Africa. Estimated age of 35.8–39.3 ka.  L3a2 – Found across Eastern Africa. Estimated age of 48.3–57.7 ka.  L3b'f  L3b – Spread from East Africa in the upper paleolithic to West-Central Africa. Some subclades spread from Central Africa to East Africa with the Bantu migration.  L3b1a – Common subclade. Estimated age of 11.7-14.8 ka.  L3b1a2 – Subclade found in Northeast Africa, the Maghreb, and Middle East. Emerged 12–14 ka.  L3f – Northeast Africa, Sahel, Arabian peninsula, Iberia. Gaalien, Beja  L3f1  L3f1a – Carried by migrants from Eastern Africa into the Sahel and Central Africa.  L3f1b – Carried by migrants from Eastern Africa into the Sahel and Central Africa.  L3f1b1 – Carried from Central Africa into Southern and Eastern Africa with the Bantu migration.  L3f1b1a – Settled from East-Central Africa to Central-West Africa and into North Africa and Berber regions.  L3f1b4 – Carried from Central Africa into Southern and Eastern Africa with the Bantu migration.  L3f1b6 – Rare, found in Iberia.  L3f2 – Primarily distributed in East Africa. Also found in North Africa and Central Africa.  L3f3 – Spread from Eastern Africa to Chad and the Sahel around 8–9 ka. Found in the Chad Basin.  L3c'd  L3c – Extremely rare lineage with only two samples found so far in Eastern Africa and the Near East.  L3d – Spread from East Africa in the upper paleolithic to Central Africa. Some subclades spread to East Africa with the Bantu migration. Found among the Fulani, Chadians, Ethiopians, Akan people, Mozambique, Yemenites, Egyptians, Berbers  L3d3a1 – Primarily found in Southern Africa. Supplementary data .  L3e'i'k'x  L3e – Spread from East Africa in the upper paleolithic to West-Central Africa. It is the most common L3 sub-clade in Bantu-speaking populations. L3e is suggested to be associated with a Central African origin and is also the most common L3 subclade amongst African Americans, Afro-Brazilians and Caribbeans  L3e1 – Spread from West-Central Africa to Southwest Africa with the Bantu migration. Found in Angola (6.8%). Mozambique, Sudanese and Kikuyu from Kenya as well as in Yemen and among the Akan people  L3e5 – Originated in the Chad Basin. Found in Algeria, as well as Burkina Faso, Nigeria, South Tunisia, South Morocco and Egypt  L3i Almost exclusively found in East Africa.  L3i1   L3i1b – Subclade is found in Yemen, Ethiopia, and among Gujarati Indians.  L3i2 (former L3w) – Found in the Horn of Africa and Oman.  L3k – Rare haplogroup primarily found in North Africa and the Sahel.  L3x – Almost exclusively found in East Africa. Found among Ethiopian Oromos, Egyptians  L3h – Almost exclusively found in East Africa.  L3h1 – Primarily found in East Africa with branches of L3h1b1 sporadically found in the Sahel and North Africa.  L3h2 – Found in Northeast Africa and Socotra. Split from other L3h branches as early as 65–69 ka during the middle paleolithic.   Ancient and historic samples  Haplogroup L3 has been observed in an ancient fossil belonging to the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B culture. L3x2a was observed in a 4,500 year old hunter-gather excavated in Mota, Ethiopia, with the ancient fossil found to be most closely related to modern Southwest Ethiopian populations. Haplogroup L3 has also been found among ancient Egyptian mummies (1/90; 1%) excavated at the Abusir el-Meleq archaeological site in Middle Egypt, with the rest deriving from Eurasian subclades, which date from the Pre-Ptolemaic/late New Kingdom and Ptolemaic periods. The Ancient Egyptian mummies bore Near eastern genomic component most closely related to modern near easterners. Additionally, haplogroup L3 has been observed in ancient Guanche fossils excavated in Gran Canaria and Tenerife on the Canary Islands, which have been radiocarbon-dated to between the 7th and 11th centuries CE. All of the clade-bearing individuals were inhumed at the Gran Canaria site, with most of these specimens found to belong to the L3b1a subclade (3/4; 75%) with the rest from both islands (8/11; 72%) deriving from Eurasian subclades.

Siege of Lisbon (1384),"The Siege of Lisbon was a siege of the city of Lisbon from 29 May to 3 September 1384, between the Portuguese defenders of the city led by John I of Portugal and the Castillian army led by King John I of Castile. The siege ended in a disaster for Castile. A plague outbreak together with the constant attacks by Portuguese forces led by Nuno Álvares Pereira caused huge casualties among the Castilian ranks, who were forced to retreat four months after the start of the siege.  Fodasse  References Miguel Duarte, Luís, Batalhas da História de Portugal - Guerra pela Independência, Academia Portuguesa de História, Lisboa, 2006, Vol. IV, pp 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 101  1384 in Europe Lisbon 1384 Conflicts in 1384 Lisbon (1384) Lisbon","The Siege of Lisbon was the last major siege fought in Portugal during its Reconquista against Moors and Muslims, which lasted from 1383 to 1385. In September 1384 King John I ordered his son Prince Henry the Navigator to lead an army into Spain to help Alfonso XI de Castilla fight off Pedro el Cruel's attack on Toledo.  The Portuguese fleet sailed up the Tagus river past Lisbon towards Vigo where it met the Castilian fleet under Don Fadrique Enriquez Osorio at Vigo.   On 24 October 1384 the two fleets attacked each other near Vigo but were unable to break through their respective defences.    In November 1384 Prince Henry returned home after receiving news that he had been elected as king by Cortes Generales held in Burgos.   He left behind Álvaro Martins Homem who took over command of the Portuguese forces fighting in Galicia until January 1385 when João Fernandes Lavrador became commander-in-chief of all troops defending Portugal south of the Douro River.   During this time the city of Lisbon was defended by only 1,500 men led by Pero Anes do Canto while the rest of the population fled or hid inside houses.   By February 1385 the number of defenders dropped below 500 due to disease and desertion.   After several failed attempts to relieve the city, King John sent reinforcements commanded by Nuno Álvares Pereira along with supplies including foodstuffs such as wine, oil, salt fish, meat, flour, beans, chickens, eggs, cheese, butter, honey, fruit, vegetables, nuts, spices, herbs, sugar cane juice, vinegar, raisins, figs, almonds, chestnuts, hazelnuts, walnuts, olives, garlic cloves, pepper, cinnamon sticks, saffron threads, coriander seeds, cumin seeds; also included weapons like swords, lances, crossbows, arrows, bolts; clothing items like tunics, cloaks, hats, gloves; medicine like oils, salves, bandages, potions, syrups, pills, powders, unguents, lotions, balms, plasters, compresses, scent sachets, incense burners; tools like axes, hammers, chisels, saw blades, knifes, pliers, pincers, files, nails, screws, wrenches, iron bars, ropes, pulleys, hooks, locks, keys, buckles, stirrups, harnesses, halters, bridle reins, leather straps, rope cords, cloth bags, canvas tarpaulins, wooden boards, wooden crates, stone blocks, stones, bricks, mortar mix, lime, sandstone, tiles, glass bottles.

Andrew van der Bijl,"Andrew van der Bijl (born 11 May 1928; known in English-speaking countries as Brother Andrew) is a Dutch Christian missionary, known for smuggling Bibles into communist countries at the height of the Cold War. For his activities, he earned the nickname ""God's Smuggler"". He is known for having prayed ""Lord, make seeing eyes blind"" when he was stopped at the border of a communist country for his car to be inspected.  Biography Van der Bijl was born in Sint Pancras, the Netherlands, the fourth of six children of a poor, near-deaf blacksmith and an invalid mother. He told John and Elizabeth Sherrill, when they transcribed his memories for their book God's Smuggler, ""From the day I first put on wooden shoes – klompen we call them in Holland – I dreamed of derring-do"".  In the 1940s, he enlisted in the colonial army of the Dutch East Indies during the rebellion that would eventually form Indonesia, which first adventure initially had unpleasant results; he endured a period of severe emotional stress while he was serving as a soldier. He was wounded in the ankle during the fighting; during his rehabilitation, he read the Bible obsessively, eventually converting to Christianity. Van der Bijl studied at the WEC Missionary Training College in Glasgow, Scotland.  Ministry In July 1955, Andrew van der Bijl visited Communist Poland ""to see how my brothers are doing"", a reference to the underground church there. He signed up on a government-controlled Communist tour, the only legal way to be in the country. During that time, he felt called to respond to the Biblical Commission, ""Wake up, strengthen what remains and is about to die"" (). That was the start of a mission leading him into several communist-ruled countries in which religious belief was actively persecuted. In 1957, he travelled to the Soviet Union’s capital, Moscow, in a Volkswagen Beetle, which later became the symbol of Open Doors, the organization he founded. An older couple, the Whetstras, had given him their new car because they had prayed about it and believed that Andrew would need the car. A man who lived in Amersfoort, Karl de Graaf, claimed that God told him to teach Van der Bijl to drive. Later, when Van der Bijl was in a refugee camp in West Germany, Philip Whetstra called Van der Bijl to come to the Whetstras' new house in Amsterdam. Although Van der Bijl was violating the laws of all of the countries that he visited by bringing religious literature, he often placed the material in view when he was stopped at police checkpoints, as a gesture of his trust in what he believed to be God's protection. That was the realization of his childhood dreams of derring-do.  Van der Bijl visited China in  the 1960s, after the Cultural Revolution had created a hostile policy towards Christianity and other religions, during the so-called Bamboo Curtain. He went to Czechoslovakia when the suppression by Soviet troops of the Prague Spring had put an end to relative religious freedom there. He encouraged Czech believers and gave Bibles to the Russian occupying forces. During that decade, he also made his first visits to Cuba after the Cuban Revolution.  God's Smuggler In 1967, he published the first edition of God's Smuggler, written with John and Elizabeth Sherrill. God's Smuggler tells the story of his early childhood, conversion to Christianity, and adventures as a Bible-smuggler behind the Iron Curtain. By 2002, it had sold over 10 million copies in thirty-five languages. A comic book adaptation of God's Smuggler was published in 1972 by Spire Christian Comics.  Middle East After the fall of Communism in Europe, he shifted his focus to the Middle East and has worked to strengthen the church in the Muslim world. In the 1970s, he visited war-torn Lebanon several times, stating that ""global conflict in the end times will focus on Israel and its neighbouring countries.""  Light Force and Secret Believers In the 1990s, van der Bijl again travelled several times more to the Middle East. In his book Light Force, he tells of Arab and Lebanese churches in Lebanon, Israel and Israeli-occupied areas expressing great delight at the mere visit of a fellow Christian from abroad since they felt that the church in the Western world at large was largely ignoring them.  In similar fashion, van der Bijl and a companion, Al Janssen, visited Hamas and PLO leaders, including Ahmed Yassin and Yasser Arafat, and handed out Bibles.  Van der Bijl's tenth book, Secret Believers: What Happens When Muslims Believe in Christ, was released on 1 July 2007.

Aubrey Lewis,"Sir Aubrey Julian Lewis, FRCP, FRCPsych (8 November 1900 – 21 January 1975), was the first Professor of Psychiatry at the Institute of Psychiatry, London (now part of King's College London), and is credited with being a driving force behind the flowering of British psychiatry after World War II as well as raising the profile of the profession worldwide.  Early life Aubrey Julian Lewis was born on 8 November 1900 in Adelaide, the only child of Jewish parents George Solomon Lewis  ( – 23 May 1931), an English accountant known only as George Lewis, and his South Australian-born wife Rachel ""Ré"" Lewis, née Isaacs  ( – ), a sister of Levi Isaacs, prominent member of Adelaide's Jewish community. Ré and Levi were among six children who were brought out to South Australia from Newcastle upon Tyne by their parents Solomon Isaacs (c. 1830 – 30 August 1913) and his wife Pauline (c. 1830 – 14 July 1923) aboard the ship Sophia around 1865 George Lewis married Ré Isaacs, elocution teacher and Adelaide Synagogue's longtime Sabbath School teacher, at the Synagogue on 16 August 1899.  Lewis was educated at Christian Brothers College, Wakefield Street, Adelaide, where he proved to be a gifted pupil. He studied medicine at the University of Adelaide and graduated with distinction in 1923 (M.B., B.S.).  Career Lewis worked at the Royal Adelaide Hospital for two years and undertook anthropological research on Aboriginal Australians. In 1926 he accepted a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship in psychological medicine. This brought him to the Phipps Clinic under the mentorship of Adolf Meyer, whom he respected and admired greatly, and whose work he praised in lectures such as the Adolf Meyer Lecture in 1960. This was the start of two years postgraduate study performed in the US and thence on to Germany. Lewis then moved to the United Kingdom and joined the staff of the Maudsley Hospital London in 1928. In 1931 he received his M.D. from the University of Adelaide and in 1936 he became Clinical Director of the Maudsley Hospital. In 1938 he became a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians.  Lewis was a member of the Eugenics Society. A chapter he contributed to a 1934 book on 'The Chances of Morbid Inheritance', edited by Carlos Blacker, has been described as 'remarkable for its total admiration for the German work and workers"", including Ernst Rudin.  Institute of Psychiatry In 1946 the Maudsley Hospital's medical school was re-designated the Institute of Psychiatry under the auspices of the University of London and Lewis was appointed to the inaugural Chair of Psychiatry at the institute. He held this post until his retirement in 1966.  It has been said that the flowering of British psychiatry after World War II can be attributed to three factors: a long humanitarian tradition; the National Health Service and Aubrey Lewis. Lewis built a reputation as a leader, educator and administrator and is credited with moulding the Institute into a model of scientific research and teaching attracting many of the most promising medical graduates from around the world. He is also credited with raising the profile of psychiatry worldwide, through his work as an adviser to general medical bodies, national and international research councils, and political organisations. He was a member of the Advisory Committee on Medical Research of the World Health Organization.  Many esteemed psychiatrists worked under the direction of Lewis at the Institute of Psychiatry, including Martin Roth and Michael Shepherd; the latter was at great pains to point out that Lewis's impact also extended to his contributions as a clinician, scholar and researcher, particularly in the field of epidemiology, but also genetics, clinical phenomenology and biology. He was perhaps best known for his studies of melancholia and obsessional illness, and indeed guided the young Michael Shepherd on his research into morbid jealousy.  Honours and awards Knighthood in 1959  Honorary fellow of the Royal College of Psychiatrists (1972)  Family and personal life On 22 February 1934 at the Liberal Jewish Synagogue, Marylebone, London Lewis married Hilda North Stoessiger, a child psychiatrist. Hilda died in 1966 which affected Lewis greatly. They had two daughters and two sons, all of whom survived Lewis. Lewis died on 21 January 1975 in Charing Cross Hospital, London. A memorial service was held in April at the Synagogue in which he had been married.  Sir Aubrey had an austere appearance, captured in Ruskin Spear's official portrait of 1966. But to those who knew him his high standards of personal and professional integrity went with a warm, kindly, humorous disposition which earned him the affection of colleagues and friends. Michael Shepherd described him as a ""representative man"" in Emerson's sense of the term.

Rhino Foods,"Rhino Foods Incorporated, founded in 1981 by Anne and Ted Castle, is a specialty ice cream novelty and ice cream ingredient manufacturer located in Burlington, Vermont, United States. Rhino Foods has grown from a small ice cream shop, Chessy's Frozen Custard, into a business with over 150 employees. In 2013, the company became a certified B Corporation joining over a 1000 companies worldwide in the unified goal to use business as a force for good for people and the planet. The company is best known locally for their ice cream sandwich, the Chesster.  In 1991, the company worked with Ben & Jerry's to develop the first cookie dough for use in ice cream. The company produces cookie dough and baked pieces for most major brands in the ice cream industry. The company also co-packs ice cream cookie sandwiches for national and international companies.  Employee Exchange program Rhino Foods' operates the Employee Exchange Program (EEP) as a way to manage seasonal staffing demands to the benefit of employees and the company. The company sent 15 factory workers as temporary staff to the lip balm manufacturer Autumn Harp for a week to deal with the holiday rush.  The Employee Exchange Program was developed in 1993 when a group of Rhino employees held brainstorming sessions on how to respond to a drop in staffing needs during the winter months.  Income Advance Program In 2007, Rhino Foods started a new employee program to support short-term and long-term financial stability.  Any employee that has worked at the company for 12 months can get a same day loan up to a $1000 from Rhino's credit union partner.  The loan is paid off with automatic weekly payroll deductions.  When the loan is repaid the deduction rolls into a savings account in the employee's name unless the employee cancels it.  This helps employees build a relationship with a bank and improve their credit rating.  Ted Castle Ted Castle is the founder, owner, and CEO of Rhino Foods. He is a former All-American hockey player at the University of Vermont from the 1970s. He coached in Vermont as well as Maine and played professionally in Italy and Sweden. He is also known for his activism with child abuse prevention, Shelburne Farms, The United Way, and Vermont Special Olympics.   The Vermont Businesses for Social Responsibility (VBSR) presented Castle with the 2009 Terry Ehrich Award for Socially Responsible Business Practices.

Andres Valdez,"Andres Valdez is an American social activist from Albuquerque, New Mexico.  Early life and education  Valdez was born in Denver, Colorado and raised in San Luis, Colorado. Though once employed as a carpenter, he now works as a professional activist.  Activism  In November 1997 Valdez was appointed by the city of Albuquerque to the ""Task Force on Police Oversight,"" a city council convened advisory group formed to make recommendations on a new system of oversight for Albuquerque's police department. He requested appointment to a 2013 task force convened by the council to make a new series of recommendations on the police oversight system, though the council declined to make him a member.  Since 2002, Valdez has filed a variety of complaints and lawsuits against the city of Albuquerque and city officials, including former mayor Martin Chávez and current mayor Richard J. Berry, and has been involved in a number of demonstrations that have interrupted city meetings and events.  In 1997, and again in 2014, he attempted to serve ""arrest warrants"" he had self-signed against police officers. In 2006 Valdez and Gwen Packard led a protest prior to the city's Martin Luther King Jr. Day Parade saying they wanted to end the ""glamorization of Native American oppression by Albuquerque's Tri-Centennial initiative."" In 2010 Valdez received $10,000 in an out-of-court settlement by the city over a lawsuit he had brought after being ruled out-of-order during the public comment period at a police oversight commission meeting. During a May 2014 demonstration by Valdez and several dozen protesters at the chambers of the Albuquerque city council, Valdez announced a ""coup d'etat"" against the city's government. The city council president ultimately adjourned the meeting and it was reconvened several days later.  Political campaigns  In 1997 Valdez sought election to the Albuquerque city council, ultimately losing to Tim Kline with 13-percent of the vote.  In 2012 Valdez announced his candidacy for U.S. Senate. In an early debate he declared Martin Heinrich a ""pup"" who lacked life experience, though, subsequently withdrew from the race citing ""the outrageous amount of money needed to run.”  References  American activists People from Albuquerque, New Mexico People from Denver Year of birth missing (living people) Living people People from Costilla County, Colorado","Andres Valdez (born September 16, 1974) is the current mayor of Santa Clara del Cobre in Michoacán state and former president municipal of Salvador Escalante from 2009 to 2012.

X-tree,"In computer science, an X-tree (for eXtended node tree) is an index tree structure based on the R-tree used for storing data in many dimensions. It appeared in 1996, and differs from R-trees (1984), R+-trees (1987) and R*-trees (1990) because it emphasizes prevention of overlap in the bounding boxes, which increasingly becomes a problem in high dimensions. In cases where nodes cannot be split without preventing overlap, the node split will be deferred, resulting in super-nodes.  In extreme cases, the tree will linearize, which defends against worst-case behaviors observed in some other data structures.  Structure The X-tree consists of three different types of nodes—data nodes, normal directory nodes and supernodes. The data nodes of the X-tree contain rectilinear minimum bounding rectangles (MBRs) together with pointers to the actual data objects, and the directory nodes contain MBRs together with pointers to sub-MBRs. Supernodes are large directory nodes of variable size(a multiple of the usual block size). The basic goal of supernodes is to avoid splits in the directory that would result in an inefficient directory structure.  References  R-tree Database index techniques","The Xtree is the first tree-like structure to be built in space, and was launched on December 16, 2009 from Yasny Air Force Base near Moscow by Russian rocket Zenit-2SB. It consists of three main parts: trunk (the central core), branches (which are attached at different angles) and leaves (attached to each branch). The total mass of all parts together is about 1 tonne; it has a height of 3 metres (9 ft 10 in).

Hugo Matthysen,"Hugo Matthysen (born 30 January 1956, in Ekeren) is a Belgian (Flemish) singer, guitarist, columnist, writer, Master in Philosophy and actor. He lives in the municipality of Hove in Antwerp.  Biography In 1978, he played with Bart Peeters and Jan Leyers in the coverband Beri-Beri.  In 1984, he regularly appeared with Bart Peeters and Marcel Vanthilt in Peeters' programme Villa Tempo as ""De Hermannen"". De Hermannen were three people with sunglasses, blonde wedge and wearing black jackets with a white sweater beneath, with which they intentionally looked like the German singer Heino. They played absurd sketches.  Matthysen then also started to write for the magazine HUMO, for which he would create several columns. He also founded a humouristic rock band, named ""Hugo Matthysen en De Bomen"", and in 1989 he delivered weekly contributions to the absurd programme Lava by Kamagurka and Herr Seele.  Together with Bart Peeters he created the radio programme Het Leugenpaleis for Studio Brussel. Later a television version came out with the (anagram) title Het Peulengaleis. Apart from that, he is the writer of TV series for children like Kulderzipken and Dag Sinterklaas and he is also author of the theater piece Frankenstein by Smrntwsk Alleen (1989). On top of that, he wrote some music texts for De Nieuwe Snaar.  The Dag Sinterklaas series he wrote about Sinterklaas (=Saint Nicholas, European origin of Santa Claus) since the early 1990s gave children in Flanders, Belgium a view on the daily life of the holy man. Also, it explained some of the questions children have around the event: why Zwarte Piet (Black Peter) is black (not his original skin colour, but because of sliding through the chimney) and how Sinterklaas acquires the presents (with a special kind of money). 20 years later, Bart Peeters stated it is thanks to Matthysen that in Belgium the Sinterklaas event has not been subject of a racism discussion as it has been in the Netherlands, because the series explains the figure of Zwarte Piet has nothing to do with slavery.  In 1990, together with HUMO chief-editor Guy Mortier, he presented the acts on the festival Torhout-Werchter (currently Rock Werchter).  His alter ego Clement Peerens became famous with his band CPeX (Clement Peerens Explosition – together with Ronny Mosuse and again Bart Peeters) and the girl band Hormonia.  In the summer of 2008, Hugo Matthysen again gave concerts with the Clement Peerens Explosition.  In 2010, he wrote the humouristic TV program Anneliezen.

"Arredondo, Florida","Arredondo, Florida is an unincorporated community in Alachua County, about seven miles southwest of Gaineville on the highway from Gainesville to Archer. It was established as a shipping station on the Florida Railroad that ran from Fernandina through Gainesville to Cedar Key, largely absorbing an earlier community called Kanapaha. The Florida Railroad later became part of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad, which abandoned the line from Archer to Cedar Key in 1932. The tracks were removed in the 1970s.   The name of the community comes from the Arredondo Grant, a Spanish land grant that includes much of Alachua County and parts of Levy and Marion counties. A post office opened in Arredondo in 1873 and remained in service until 1925.  The area around Arredondo was used to raise cattle in the middle of the 19th century, and some cattle-raising continued into the 1880s.  In the 1850s, cotton growers from South Carolina established plantations, including the Haile Homestead, in the area, which was then called Kanapaha. The soil around Arredondo is fertile, with underlying deposits of phosphate rock contributing to the fertility. After the Civil War, the cotton planters and newcomers to the area turned to vegetable, fruit and tree-nut production. In the 1883 season, 80,000 crates of vegetables were shipped from the Arredondo station. Strawberries shipped to New York in early February sold for $3.00 a quart.  Farmers began experimenting with the commercial production of tomatoes in the area of Arredondo in 1870. In 1872,  were planted to tomatoes, and Arredondo became the center of tomato-growing in Florida. Tomatoes were a profitable crop. In 1882, Florida tomatoes sold for $4.00 to $4.50 per bushel crate in Chicago. As railroads extended further south in Florida, tomato-growing also moved south, permitting an earlier harvest for shipment to the north. Commercial tomato growing, and commercial vegetable growing in general, had ceased in the area around Arredondo by 1900.

The current name, Atwood, was suggested in 1883 by William Dunn after his niece Eliza Gray, of Detroit, had noticed that the new hamlet was surrounded by woods .  The “Atwood WG&B Ry Station” was built in 1877. The first railway station master was M. Duncan of the Great West Railway. The entrance to the station was from George Street, (now George Avenue). The station closed in 1969 and was later demolished.   In 2011, Kenneth Rea, a volunteer firefighter from Atwood, was killed battling a fire in Listowel when the roof of the building collapsed.

The town was named after Dr. John A. Atwood who served as Chief Medical Officer at Kingston General Hospital from 1852 until his death in 1864.   It has been suggested that he may have also been responsible for naming the nearby village of Midland (now known simply as ""Midlands"").   In addition to being a doctor, Atwood had many other interests including geology, botany, entomology, ornithology, anthropology, archaeology, paleontology, astronomy, meteorology, mineralogy, hydrology, hydrography, cartography, engineering, surveying, medicine, surgery, obstetrics, ophthalmology, anatomy, physiology, pathology, bacteriology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, music theory, history, literature, philosophy, ethics, sociology, political science, economics, agriculture, horticulture, forestry, fisheries, mining, metallurgical sciences, mechanical arts, electrical arts, military affairs, naval architecture, shipbuilding, steam power generation, railway construction, road building, bridge-building, waterworks design, irrigation systems development, hydraulic machinery manufacturing, agricultural implements production, architectural designs, furniture making, clothing manufacture, printing press ownership, book publishing, newspaper writing, magazine editing, radio broadcasting, television producing, film directing, theatre acting, opera singing, musical composition, poetry-writing, painting, sculpture-making, photography, engraving, woodworking, metalworking; all fields which are now considered separate disciplines within their own respective academic departments or faculties.

It brought the house down. Definitely the smash hit of “New Beginnings” festival. Michael Timelty (“Glasgow Herald”, November 27, 1989)  Atmospheric sounds of the Armenian Church music mingled with electronic strings and piano timbres and the acoustic instruments in a slow and solemn movement that reached a searingly intense climax. Those two pieces rate as the best and the most sincere works so far played in the “New Beginnings” Festival.  Janet Beat (“Scotsman”, November 28, 1989)  Rostomyan’s Third Symphony-the great popular success of “New Beginnings”- carried its listeners inexorably from its wonderfully atmospheric opening, to the voluptuous, Holywoodish glamour of its heavenly chorus. Jings, I was nearly greetin’ at it, transfixed by the sheer sonic splendor. It had a soul like a calculation.  Michael Timelty (“Glasgow Herald”, November 29, 1989)  I was most intrigued by the Third Symphony. It is a fascinating work and beautifully composed. Harold Hagopian (RCA/Victor BMG producer, 2002)  Stepan Rostomyan’s music reflects a synthesis of European and Oriental traditions, In Rostomyan’s music one can hear influences of the ancient Armenian monody; it is very coloristic and religious. His Symphony and some miniatures – for example “The Angeles’” Canticles are popular in the West. Mark Rais ( “A Special Issue of Leonardo”, USA Volume 24:2, 1991)  Third Symphony of Rostomyan is a genius piece. Rodion  Shchedrin ( composer June, 2008)  We have been listening ""Tagh of Angels"" several times, so much we were taken by its tension and strong message. This is really great and strong music.

Screen direction,"In film editing, video editing and post production, screen direction is the direction that actors or objects appear to be moving on the screen from the point of view of the camera or audience. A rule of film editing and film grammar is that movement from one edited shot to another must maintain the consistency of screen direction in order to avoid audience confusion.  ""Camera left"" or ""frame left"" indicates movement towards the left side of the screen, while ""camera right"" or ""frame right"" refers to movement towards the right side of the screen.  ""Foreground"" refers to the apparent space close to the camera (and thus to the audience), and ""background"" refers to the apparent space in the distance away from the camera and the audience.  As an example of screen direction in use, if an actor is shown in one shot walking from screen left to screen right and then is shown in the next shot to be moving in the opposite direction (screen right to screen left), the audience will assume that the actor has changed direction and is walking back to where he started (in the absence of obvious contextual or environmental cues).  If the shot shows him again moving from screen left to screen right (as in the first shot), the audience will assume that the actor is continuing his previous movement and extending it to apparently cover a greater distance even if that is purely a fabrication of editing.  Another example would be if two characters are shown in a medium shot, say from the waist up, looking at each other, it is generally established that one is on the left of screen and the other on the right. The one on the left looks right to the other character and vice versa. When the editor cuts to a close shot of a person, it would be disorienting if the character looked the other way. The audience would assume that the character is looking at something else.  In the coverage of the scene, it is customary in film technique to be sure that screen direction is maintained. In a close up, the environmental cues are at a minimum.    It is the responsibility of the director, cameraman, and script supervisor on the set to maintain consistency of screen direction so that later during editing, the myriad short pieces of film can be properly assembled by the editor into a coherent film that tells the story intended.  Avant-garde, experimental, and some independent film and video productions often deliberately violate screen direction rules in order to create audience disorientation or ambiguity. However, unless it is done very skillfully, violation of screen direction can appear to the audience to be the result of filmmaker ineptitude rather than experimentation.

Jay Hooks,"Jay Hooks (born November 12, 1967) is an American Texas blues and electric blues guitarist, singer and songwriter. After gaining national exposure playing in Lavelle White's backing ensemble, Hooks has released three albums to date, appeared on German television and undertaken various tours, including one in Europe.  Life and career Hooks was born in Houston, Texas, United States. He found early musical inspiration from the recordings of fellow Texans Albert Collins, Billy Gibbons and Stevie Ray Vaughan. In the late 1980s, Hooks played in the bars of Houston, before being asked to play in Lavelle White's backing band. He played on her national tours in 1996, before forming his own band and going solo the following year. In 1997, Hooks recorded his debut album, Hooked Up, at SugarHill Recording Studios in Houston. AllMusic noted that Hooked Up contained ""a collection of gritty, rock-tinged electric blues numbers that didn't stray far outside the conventions that his aforementioned guitar heroes had brought into an international spotlight.""  The exposure the recording gave Hooks led to a European record executive, Ed van Zyl, offering Hooks a recording contract with the Dutch-based record label Provogue Records.  The resulting self-titled album was made under the tutelage of record producer Ben Elliott. Jay Hooks was recorded by the trio of Hooks (guitars, vocals), Marie Del Prete (bass) and Joe Frenchwood (drums). It was released in late 2000. His Texas rock sound was well received by the critics. At the time Hooks was quoted as saying ""... I just plug it in and turn it all up, that's what I do...""   In 2001, Hooks toured across Europe.  Jerry Gaskill played the drums on Hooks next release, the Red Line album (2002), which was also released by Provogue. Red Line mostly contained songs written by Hooks, apart from his cover of Jimi Hendrix's track, ""Freedom"". In 2003, Hooks played live on the German television show, Rockpalast.  Hooks performed at the Continental Club in Austin, Texas early in 2015. In April that year, he appeared at the House of Blues in Houston.

Scrub plane,"The scrub plane is a type of plane used to remove large amounts of wood from the surface of lumber, such as when eliminating cup or twist in the first stages of preparing rough stock, or when reducing the thickness of a board significantly. Scrub planes generally have a short sole, a relatively narrow but thick blade, a very wide mouth, and a deeply curved edge (of about a 3 inch to 7 inch radius) to make a deep, gouging cut.   A scrub plane is generally used in diagonal strokes across the face of a board, rather than parallel to the length of the board (along the grain) as with most other bench planes. In thicknessing or preparing rough stock, the scrub plane is usually followed by the jack plane, jointer plane, then smoothing plane.   Its function in modern woodworking has been largely replaced by power tools such as the thickness planer. A scrub plane can still be useful for planing boards too wide to fit through a thickness planer.

1922 Lithuanian parliamentary election,"Parliamentary elections were held in Lithuania on 10 and 11 October 1922, and elected 78 members of the First Seimas of Lithuania. This was the first election held in Lithuania under the democratic 1922 Constitution, adopted by the Constituent Assembly of Lithuania on 1 August 1922.  38 out of 78 seats were won by a bloc of parties led by the Christian Democrats, and they acquired both the positions of President and Prime Minister, occupied by Aleksandras Stulginskis and Ernestas Galvanauskas respectively. In both cases, however, the Christian Democrats were not supported by any party in the opposition and could only form a minority government. Unable to work with such a makeup, the First Seimas was dissolved on 12 March 1923.  Electoral system The law on the conduct of Seimas elections was promulgated by the Constituent Assembly on 19 July 1922, and published in the official newspaper of the government, ""Vyriausybės žinios"" (Government News) on 27 July 1922. Elections were universal, free and secret, and all citizens of Lithuania, both men and women over 21 years old, were allowed to vote. Citizens 24 years old or older were allowed to stand for election.  The elections were held with party-list proportional representation, in nine multi-member constituencies. In practice, only six of the nine defined constituencies held elections, as Constituencies VII, VIII and IX were allocated to territories occupied by Poland during the Polish–Lithuanian War in 1920. Their centers were Vilnius, Lida and Hrodna respectively.  Parties and electoral groups (kuopa) were allowed to submit lists of candidates to constituencies, which had to be signed by at least fifty voters. As such, there was a large number of small electoral lists in every constituency. However, the method of calculating the distribution of seats in each constituency benefited larger parties, as such, the only non-party electoral group which managed to gain seats were lists submitted by the underground Communist Party of Lithuania.  Competing parties The largest and most active electoral alliance in the election was the Christian Democratic Bloc, formed from the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party and two satellite organizations - Labour Federation, which represented Catholic workers, and Farmers' Association, which represented Catholic peasantry. The Christian Democratic Bloc was strongly supported by the Lithuanian priesthood, which had a strong influence in the agrarian and less literate countryside, and numerous priests were a part of their electoral lists.  However, the Christian Democrats were isolated in the political arena. Historically, LKDP evolved from a different stream of the Lithuanian National Revival than all of their competitors - the Peasant Union, Social Democrats and Party of National Progress (later the Lithuanian Nationalist Union). All of them evolved from the secular nationalist newspaper Varpas, while the Christian Democrats evolved around the Catholic periodical Tėvynės sargas.  The alliance of the Peasant Union and Popular Socialist Party presented itself as socialist and campaigned for the lifting of martial law and secularization. Though the main targets of the criticism were Christian Democrats and National Progress, they were also in opposition to the Social Democrats. The Social Democrats presented their electoral campaign as the first step towards a peaceful socialist revolution and campaigned for a ""Seimas of the workers"". All political parties supported the land reforms put in place by the Constituent Assembly, and oftentimes argued that their competitors will be the ones to roll back the reform.  Separate electoral lists by the Polish, Jewish and Russian minorities also competed in the election.  Results  Aftermath Though the Christian Democratic Bloc achieved a plurality of the seats, they were unable to form a majority coalition, nor did the opposition parties manage to unite against them. The next President and Prime Minister were thus elected via violations of electoral conduct. Protesting against the Christian Democrats, the opposition parties refused to participate in the election of Aleksandras Stulginskis and he was elected solely with Christian Democratic votes. Two governments led by independent politician Ernestas Galvanauskas were formed, but in both cases they were approved with 38 votes in favor and 38 votes against (2 members of the Seimas did not participate), which the opposition criticized as illegal.  The formed government was unstable and the First Seimas was dissolved on 12 March 1923.

The bridge was promoted by Henry Robertson, who was also M.P. for Shrewsbury and designed by the civil engineer John William Grover. It was constructed in 1883 by the Cleveland Bridge & Engineering Company, which also built the Victoria Falls Bridge. The bridge spans 212 feet (64.6m) and comprises two metal arch ribs, from which the main bridge deck is hung. It cost £11,156 to build.

D-Shape,"D-Shape is a large 3-dimensional printer that uses binder-jetting, a layer by layer printing process, to bind sand with an inorganic seawater and magnesium-based binder in order to create stone-like objects. Invented by Enrico Dini, founder of Monolite UK Ltd, the first model of the D-Shape printer used epoxy resin, commonly used as an adhesive in the construction of skis, cars, and airplanes, as the binder. Dini patented this model in 2006. After experiencing problems with the epoxy, Dini changed the binder to the current magnesium-based one and patented his printer again in September 2008. In the future, Dini aims to use the printer to create full-scale buildings.  Technical description The current version of the D-Shape 3-D printer sits in a 6m by 6m aluminum frame. The frame consists of a square base that moves upwards along four vertical beams during the printing process via stepper motors, which are used to repeatedly move a specified length and then hold in place, on each beam. Spanning the entire horizontal 6m of the base is a printer head with 300 nozzles, each spaced 20mm apart. The printer head is connected to the base by an aluminum beam that runs perpendicular to the printer head.  Process  Before the actual printing process can begin, a 3-D model of the object to be printed must be created on CAD, a software that allows a designer to create 3-D models on a computer. Once the model is finished, the CAD file is sent to the printer head. The printing process begins when a layer of sand from 5 to 10 mm thick, mixed with solid magnesium oxide (MgO), is evenly distributed by the printer head in the area enclosed by the frame. The printer head breaks the 3-D model into 2-D slices. Then, starting with the bottom slice, the head moves across the base and deposits an inorganic binding liquid made up of a solution that includes magnesium chloride, at a resolution of . The binder and sand chemically react to form a sandstone material. It takes about 24 hours for the material to completely solidify. The material is resembling by composition the Sorel cement.  Because the nozzles are 20mm apart there are gaps that may need to be filled up. To fill in these gaps and ensure the sand is uniformly exposed to the binder, an electric piston on the beam that holds the printer head forces the printer head to shift in the direction perpendicular to the printer's direction of motion. It takes D-Shape four forward and backward strokes to finish printing a layer. After a layer is finished, the stepper motors on the vertical beams move the base upwards. From the hollow framework just above the printer head, new sand, which is cyclically refilled, is distributed into the area of the frame to create the next layer. During printing, excess sand acts as a support for the solidifying sand and can also be reused in later printings. The printing process is continuous and stops only when the desired structure is completely printed.  After the printer finishes its work, the final structure must be extruded from the sand. Workers use shovels to take out the excess sand and reveal the final product. The magnesium oxide mixed in with the sand causes the sand to become an active participant rather than inert during the reaction with the binder. If the sand was inert, the resulting material would be more like concrete in that the sand would be only slightly bound together, but because of the MgO, the final product is a mineral-like material with a microcrystalline structure. Compared to concrete, which has low resistance to tension and as a result needs iron reinforcement, D-Shape's structures have relatively high tension resistance and require no iron reinforcement. The entire building process is reported to take a quarter of the time and a third to a half of the cost  it would take to build the same structure with traditional means using portland cement, the material currently used in building construction.  Awards and achievements  NYC Waterfront Construction Competition In the fall of 2012, D-Shape entered into the NYC Waterfront Construction Competition hosted by the New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC) in which competitors had to create an innovative solution to help strengthen New York City's deteriorating piers and coastline structures. D-Shape's idea, called, ""Digital Concrete,"" was to take 3-D scans of each piece of pier or infrastructure, and then print a support jacket for each specific piece. D-Shape was the First Place Winner and received $50,000 for the idea, which is estimated to save New York City $2.9 billion.  Radiolaria D-Shape successfully created the tallest printed sculpture, Radiolaria, in 2009. Radiolaria, a sculpture created by Italian architect Andrea Morgante and inspired by radiolarians, unicellular organisms with intricate mineral skeletons, shows off D-Shape's ability to print large freeform structures. The current version of the sculpture is only a 3 x 3 x 3m scale model of the full-size Radiolaria that is planned to be put in a roundabout in Pontedera, Italy.  Future of D-Shape  Currently, Jake Wake-Walker and Marc Webb are working on a documentary, titled The Man Who Prints Houses, about Enrico Dini and his invention. Although D-Shape has garnered attention for its printing abilities, it is still a work in progress. While it has gotten close to printing an actual house by printing a trullo, which is a small, stone hut, the printer still needs to be modified in order to make Dini's dreams of printing larger and more complex buildings a reality.  Lunar bases Because of D-Shape's capabilities, the European Space Agency (ESA) has taken interest in using the printer to build moon bases. The ESA is interested in using D-Shape to build moon bases out of lunar regolith, otherwise known as moon dust, because the 3-D printer can build the base onsite without human intervention. This is advantageous because only the machine would have to be taken to the moon, thus reducing the cost of bringing building materials to the lunar surface to create the bases. D-Shape has been successful in printing components for the lunar bases with a simulated moon dust, and has also been subject to tests that aim to see how the printer will work in the environment on the moon.

"Town and Country, Missouri","Town and Country is a city in west St. Louis County, Missouri, United States with a population of 11,640 as of the 2020 census. It is home to Missouri Baptist Medical Center, (locally known as MoBap).  Town and Country has the highest median household income ($134,387 in 2009) of any city in Missouri with a population over 10,000 and also has one of the highest median incomes of any city in the United States. The city is included in the St. Louis, MO-IL Metropolitan Statistical Area, and is home to Bellerive Country Club, which hosted the 1965 U.S. Open, the 1992 PGA Championship, and the 2018 PGA Championship.  Geography Town and Country is located at  (38.631002, −90.471581). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.  City landscape  Originally, it was primarily made up of large residential lots. The community first incorporated in 1950 as a village. The incorporation and establishment of a combination Public Safety Department providing three firefighters and one police officer on duty was to provide lower fire insurance rates for residents. The Village changed to city status in 1974 in an effort to increase property taxes. The maximum ""Village"" tax rate could no longer sustain the modest city government. In 1983 annexation of a large area to the west more than doubled the size of the city. This caused the city to maintain a police department and contract fire and EMS service to a neighboring fire district.  The original country charm of larger lots with white fences and grazing horses is hard to find, however there are a few exceptions. There are several large tracts of land that remain undeveloped. The area offers a quiet, restful, green residential landscape, in contrast to the more intensely developed areas typical of St. Louis County. There are relatively few commercial development areas. The predominant commercial locations tend to be at the periphery of the city boundaries along the regional arterials, and/or at the intersections of the major roads.  History Town and Country was incorporated in 1950 as a village, and re-incorporated as a fourth-class city 25 years later.

The Adventures of Bullwhip Griffin,"The Adventures of Bullwhip Griffin is a 1967 American Western comedy film directed by James Neilson, produced by Walt Disney Productions, and starring Roddy McDowall, Suzanne Pleshette, Hermione Baddeley, and Karl Malden. The film's screenplay by Lowell S. Hawley was based on the novel By the Great Horn Spoon! by Sid Fleischman. The songs were written by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman and the theme song was written by Mel Leven and George Bruns, the latter of whom also composed the film's score. It was Neilson's fifth and final film he directed for Disney.  Plot In 1849, after Arabella Flagg is orphaned in Boston, her young brother Jack and the family's former butler Eric ""Bullwhip"" Griffin stow away aboard a ship bound for San Francisco, where the gold rush has begun. Griffin gets work as the ship's cook.  A swindler and thief, Judge Higgins, steals a map to a gold mine belonging to Quentin Bartlett, an actor who is among the ship's passengers. Griffin, Jack and Bartlett all pursue the crooked judge while Arabella arrives in town and takes a job as a dancehall girl to make ends meet.  Griffin encounters a stocky bully, Mountain Ox, and lashes out a punch that flattens him. ""Bullwhip"" becomes his new nickname. Inspired by the incident, Griffin enters a prizefighting match and wins the money. He also wins Arabella's affection, while Judge Higgins, caught trying to steal the fight's receipts, quivers behind bars as a lynch mob for him forms outside.  Cast  Roddy McDowall as Eric ""Bullwhip"" Griffin  Suzanne Pleshette as Arabella Flagg  Bryan Russell as Jack Flagg  Karl Malden as Judge Higgins  Harry Guardino as Sam Trimble  Richard Haydn as Quentin Bartlett  Mike Mazurki as Mountain Ox  Hermione Baddeley as Miss Irene Chesney  Alan Carney as Joe Turner  Liam Redmond as Captain Swain   Cecil Kellaway as Mr. Pemberton  Joby Baker as Bandido Leader   Parley Baer as Chief Executioner  Arthur Hunnicutt as Referee  Dub Taylor as Timekeeper  Pedro Gonzalez Gonzalez as Bandido  John Qualen as Barber  Jimmy MacDonald as Saloon Percussionist  Tony Hancock was cast in this film but was sacked during production due to his erratic behaviour. He was replaced by Richard Haydn.  Reception Howard Thompson of The New York Times graded the film as ""Okay, no more,"" adding that ""as a Western spoof, the picture is slow, overdrawn and tame to the point of gentility. Surely young Disney fans wouldn't have cringed at some slambang, Gold Rush vigor, plus a little 'Ruggles of Red Gap' flavoring."" Arthur D. Murphy of Variety called the film ""a lively, entertaining comedy spoof of the California Gold Rush era. Zesty direction, wild performances, firstrate production values and broad comedy angles make this Walt Disney production particularly strong for all age audiences."" Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times wrote, ""Everyone turns in winning performances, but they don't get much help from Lowell S. Hawley's routine script, which too often emphasizes dialog at the expense of action, or from James Neilson's equally pedestrian direction."" The Monthly Film Bulletin stated, ""A pity that some scenes are played for more than they are worth, but there's enough liveliness here to keep all but the most sophisticated youngsters happy.""

Goodfellas (soundtrack),"Goodfellas Music from the Motion Picture is the soundtrack for the 1990 film Goodfellas, directed by Martin Scorsese, notable for its use of popular music from the various periods it portrayed. In a similar manner to American Graffiti and Scorsese's earlier Mean Streets, the songs served roughly the same purpose as a composed musical score. While an official soundtrack was released at the same time as the film, it only featured a small fraction of the songs used.  Scorsese chose the songs for Goodfellas only if they commented on the scene or the characters ""in an oblique way"". The only rule he adhered to with the soundtrack was to only use music which could have been heard at that time.  Scorsese decided that if a scene took place in the 1970s, he could use any song that was current or older. According to Scorsese, a lot of non-dialogue scenes were shot to playback. For example, he had ""Layla"" playing on the set while shooting the scene where the dead bodies are discovered in the car and the meat-truck. Sometimes, the lyrics of songs were put between lines of dialogue to comment on the action.  Some of the music Scorsese had written into the script while other songs he discovered during the editing phase. There is no music once Henry is arrested in his driveway by the DEA, until the end credits.

Luke Rhinehart,"George Powers Cockcroft (November 15, 1932 – November 6, 2020), widely known by the pen name Luke Rhinehart, was an American novelist, screenwriter, and nonfiction writer with at least ten books to his name. He is best known for his 1971 novel The Dice Man, the story of a psychiatrist who experiments with making life decisions based on the roll of a die.  The Dice Man was critically well received and a commercial success. It quickly became and remains a cult classic.It was followed by two spiritual sequels in Adventures of Wim (1986) and The Search for the Dice Man (1993) as well as a companion volume called The Book of the Die (2000). Rhinehart wrote several other novels between 1986 and 2006 though none achieved the success of The Dice Man.  Early life George Powers Cockcroft was born on November 15, 1932 in Albany, New York to Donald and Elizabeth Cockcroft, both college graduates, his mother from Wellesley College. He was raised in Albany, where his father was an electrical engineer, and his ancestry included Vermont political notables. He attended The Albany Academy, graduating in 1950, and received a BA from Cornell University in 1954 and an MA from Columbia University in 1956. In 1964 he received a PhD in American literature, also from Columbia. After obtaining his PhD, he went into teaching. During his years as a university professor he taught, among other things, courses in Zen and Western literature.  Career  In 1969, while Cockcroft was teaching a study abroad program on the island of Mallorca, an Englishman starting a new publishing house happened to stop at a cafe in the same village, Deià, and was given a partial manuscript of The Dice Man to read by Cockcroft. Cockcroft was subsequently offered an advance payment for publication. Shortly afterwards, Cockcroft was encouraged by his course Director to take an early sabbatical from his teaching duties. He remained in Mallorca to complete the novel, after which the publisher sold the American rights to the novel for a large sum, and within a year the film rights, allowing Cockcroft to retire from teaching and become a full time novelist.  Personal life and family  Cockroft married his wife, Ann, who would later become a writer of two romance novels and a volume of poetry, on June 30, 1956; together they have three children. His brother, James Cockcroft, is the author of more than 20 books, mostly on Latin American history and society.  The author and his family spent a number of years traveling, sailing, and returning to Mallorca, living in Deià in the late 1960s and early 70s, including time spent on a large catamaran which became the inspiration for the boat in his novel Long Voyage Back. In the mid 1970s they returned to the United States and spent 1975 in a sufi commune, before moving to a large old farmhouse and former religious retreat in the foothills of the Berkshires in upstate New York.  Death  On 1 August 2012, the ""death"" of Rhinehart at the age of 79 was announced by email to 25 friends, beginning with the words “It is our pleasure to inform you that Luke Rhinehart is dead”; it was later revealed the “Death Letter” was instigated as a playful hoax by Cockcroft. Reactions ranged from sorrow to gratitude and amusement.  Cockroft died in November 2020.  The Dice Man  Cockcroft has described the origin of the idea for this work variously, however, at the time of the publication of this work, ""it was not clear whether the book was fiction or autobiography"", all the more because its protagonist and author were eponymous, both were described as having the same profession (psychiatry), and elements of the described lives of both (e.g., places of residence, date of birth) were also in common; hence, curiosity over its authorship have persisted since its publication. Emmanuel Carrère, writing for The Guardian, presented a long-form expose on Cockcroft and the relationship between author and legend in 2019, and in following others, established the author Cockcroft as a life-long English professor living ""in an old farmhouse with a yard that slopes down to a duck pond"", a husband of fifty-years, father of three, and a caregiver to a special needs child.  The Dice Man was critically well received. It quickly became, and remains thought of as a cult classic. It initially sold poorly in the United States, but well in Europe, particularly England, Sweden, Denmark, and Spain. Writing in 2017 for The Guardian, Tanya Gold noted that ""over the course of 45 years"" it was still in print, had become famous, had devoted fans, and had ""sold more than 2m copies in multiple languages"" (e.g., as many as 27 languages and 60 countries have been claimed). In 1995, the BBC called it ""one of the fifty most influential books of the last half of the twentieth century,"" and in 1999, after one of their reporters experimented, controversially, with dicing, Loaded magazine named it ""Novel of the Century"". In 2013, Alex Clark of the Telegraph chose it as one of the fifty greatest cult books of the last hundred years.  Books After The Dice Man  Comic philosophical novels A number of works authored by him have a similar style to The Dice Man and alternate between first- and third-person voice with selections from fictional documents.  In one case, he even quotes from a future book that he did not actually write until more than two decades later. The voices having different characteristics, the novel's mood changes accordingly.  Presenting these multiple fragments from multiple viewpoints together resulted in a ""cubist"" narrative structure. Of this, Rhinehart stated hat they had “ always conceived of myself as being multiple – having, you know, a dozen different selves, if not a thousand different selves, at any given moment.”  Adventures of Wim was an effort to create a new interpretation of the story of Wim, a Montauk boy born of a virgin mother, declared the savior of the Montauk nation, and his life quest for Ultimate Truth. The book is told through the medium of fictional documents.  The Search for the Dice Man (1993), set twenty years later, tells the story of Rhinehart's son, Larry, who has built a highly successful and stable life, having rejected his father's embracing of Chance.  On a quest to find his father however, Larry's life of order and routine becomes enveloped in chaos, the legacy of his father's work.  From a draft written at the same time as The Dice Man, Naked Before the World (2008) celebrates the lives of both hippies and the establishment in 1960s Mallorca through the story of Katya, an innocent Catholic art student who arrives on the island to study abroad. Katya is thrown into a world of artists, frauds, sex, drugs and the struggle to discover who she wants to be.  In Jesus Invades George: An Alternative History (2013), which takes place in 2007, then-sitting President George W. Bush is possessed by the spirit of Jesus Christ. The story playfully reveals and deconstructs the hypocrisy of government and modern politics.  In Invasion (2016), aliens invade Earth for the sole purpose of having fun. Hyper-intelligent and able to morph into multiple forms, they play games with culture and infrastructure, from computer networks and social media to corporate culture and human relationships. The resulting mayhem reveals the primitive nature of our society, and offers an alternative vision for the human race. A sequel is to be published entitled The Hairy Balls and the End of Civilization.  Conventional novels In Matari (1975)  (republished as White Wind, Black Rider (2008)) is historical fiction set in 18th Century Japan, the beautiful Matari is joined by two zen poets as she flees from her husband, a samurai lord who is giving chase with intent to murder her. A lyrical and poetic tale of love, honor and morality.  Long Voyage Back (1983), a nautical action-adventure novel, follows a group of people sailing aboard a trimaran, and their struggle for survival as they escape the aftermath of nuclear war.  Nonfiction The Book of est (1976) is a narrative account of Werner Erhard's controversial LGAT course  personal transformation course known as Erhard Seminar Training or est, which began in 1971. (Erhard insisted on using lower case letters for the acronym.) The reader is put in the place of a participant, in order to vicariously ""experience"" the training. Erhard authored a foreword to the book.  The Book of the Die (2000) is “handbook of dice living” intended to help free readers from barriers to an unfulfilled life. It follows the philosophy that people must give up their illusion that a self can control life; they must let go.  A collection of proverbs, essays, cartoons, poems, scenes from movies and more form this guide to creating a more playful and unpredictable life.  Other works  Screenplays Though best known as a novelist, Rhinehart has also written nine screenplays: five are based directly on his novels: The Dice Man, The Search for the Dice Man, Whim, Naked Before the World, and White Wind, Black Rider. Two others are direct Dice Man sequels featuring the original character: The Dice Lady (co-written with Peter Forbes), and Last Roll of the Die (co-written with Nick Mead). Two other screenplays, Mawson and Picton's Chance, are original concepts.  Audio The music and spoken word album, The Dice Man Speaks, on Dice Man Records, a new imprint of bizbro CREATIVE, features the pseudonymous Rhinehart and Sputnik Weazel and was released in 2018.  On it, Cockcroft/Rhinehart performs spoken word passages voiced over acoustic and electronic musical pieces by Weazel.  Antecedents and influence To date there appears to be a single published scholarly work on the ideas appearing in Cockcroft's The Dice Man, a conference paper from Shanna Robinson of the Institute for Culture and Society at the University of Western Sydney in Australia; in addressing the popular accounts of Dickson on its having the ""impact of religious conversion on millions"" and the suggestion, again in popular media (by Dickson and Adams), that the dicing theme was, at that time, ""enjoying a renaissance"", Robinson writes:Although acknowledged that there has been no research at this point establishing the veracity of this, a number of other manifestations of dicing lend some credibility to the idea that it enjoys a certain level of popularity.  Also, the starting point for David Colton's 2019 PhD thesis, ″Canned Chance, The commodification of aleatory art practice″ is the Dice Man novel. The novel, and the use of dice and other tools for accessing chance are discussed here. See Manchester Metropolitan University, http://e-space.mmu.ac.uk/view/creators/Colton=3ADavid,_G=3A=3A.html  More generally, art exploring the application of chance or randomness in its expression is referred to as aleatoricism, and at least one academic, Richard Hoadley, a faculty member in Music and Performing Arts at Anglia Ruskin University in the United Kingdom, refers to the writings of Cockcroft/Rhinehart in their teaching on aleatoricism in art.  In popular culture  Music A 1979 song by The Fall called ""Dice Man"" takes its title and general concept from the book.  The Talk Talk song, ""Such A Shame"", was inspired by The Dice Man.  The At The Gates song, ""World of Lies"", quotes The Dice Man during its spoken word lyrics.  Television and radio Four seasons of a television travel series called The Diceman were made between 1998 and 2000 by the Discovery Channel. The destinations and activities of the participants were determined by the roll of a die.  UK Channel 4's broadcast of Diceworld (1999, Paul Wilmshurst directing), a 50-minute television documentary about Cockcroft/Rhinehart and some of the people influenced by his novels, led to a resurgence of interest in Cockcroft/Rhinehart's books, and in various related ""dicing projects"". A further documentary was produced in 2004, a collaboration between Cockcroft/Rhinehart and director Nick Mead, entitled Dice Life: The Random Mind of Luke Rhinehart.  Theater Inspired by The Dice Man and written by Paul Lucas, the play The Dice House premiered in the United Kingdom in 2001, and went on to staging at the Arts Theatre in London's West End in 2004.  Magazines and books Controversially, journalist Ben Marshall spent two years from 1998 to 2000 experimenting with dicing, and reporting his experiences in Loaded magazine; Loaded subsequently named Cockcroft/Rhinehart as novelist of the century.  Murder mystery author Terry Mitchell often uses characters who throw dice to make decisions, and in his own personal life, Mitchell created the ""dice road trip"", ""dicing to eat"", and ""The Sacred Journey"", each of which used dice to make decisions about life decisions.  Comics and related media The UK comic, 2000 AD, published the Gamebook magazine title, Dice Man, in 1986; in total 5 editions were created by Pat Mills through October of that year, with script and game by Mills, covers by Glenn Fabry, and with art and lettering done by various individuals at 2000 AD. The relationship between this comic title and the similarly titled Cockcroft work has been established.  Advertising The brewers of Rolling Rock beer launched an advertising campaign in the United Kingdom in 1998 based on The Dice Man theme, a campaign that included a short-lived Dice Life website. The relationship between this campaign and Cockcroft's work has been established.  Art San Francisco artist Larnie Fox created War Toys, ""an exhibit of kinetic sound sculptures"", for which an activity, ""The Dicewalk"", inspired by Cockcroft's work, was part of its closing ceremony.

Rhinehart was born on September 16, 1946 to parents who were both teachers at St Joseph's Catholic School in Waimānalo Hawaii.  He attended Saint Louis High School where he played football.   After graduating from high school Luke moved back home to Honolulu where his father had accepted a teaching position.    In 1968 after spending two years working as a waiter and bartender Luke decided that he wanted more out of life than what he could get by being employed full time so he quit his job and began traveling around Europe.   During this period while living abroad Luke met many people including some famous artists such as Salvador Dalí whom he describes as one of the most interesting men he'd ever known.   Upon returning to America Luke spent several months backpacking through California before moving into San Francisco where he lived until 1974 when he returned once again to Hawaii.   While living there Luke worked various jobs ranging from construction work to selling real estate but it wasn't long before he realized that none of these positions fulfilled him like they used to.   It was during this period that Luke developed his interest in writing which eventually led him to write ""The Art of Struggle"".   In 1977 Luke married Lisa Marie Smith and together they have three children;  Luke Jr., Lani, and Koa.

Methodist Episcopal Society of Tyringham,"Methodist Episcopal Society of Tyringham (or the Union Church and Parsonage) is a historic church at 128-130 Main Road in Tyringham, Massachusetts, and is presently the only church standing in the community.  The property includes a Greek Revival church building built in 1844, and a parsonage house next door.  Between 1844 and 1907, the church was also used for town meetings.  The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.  Description and history The Methodist Episcopal Society of Tyringham is located in Tyringham's small main village, on the west side of Main Road at Church Road, with the parsonage across Church Road to the south.  The church is a rectangular wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and mostly clapboarded exterior.  The front facade is finished flushboarding, and is sheltered by a projecting four-column Ionic portico.  The columns support a fully pedimented gable, which houses a series of recessed panels.  The main facade is blank except for the main entrance and wide corner pilasters.  The entrance opening is framed by pilasters and topped by a broad corniced entablature; the doorway within the opening is framed by paneling matching that of the door.  The church's tower rises to a height of  in square tiered stages.  The church was built in 1844, when the community was at the height of its prosperity, and is one of Berkshire County's finest examples of Greek Revival church architecture.  It was built by a Reformed Methodist congregation as its second sanctuary, the first having been destroyed by fire.  The house was built around the same time as the church as a private residence, and was only acquired for use as a parsonage in 1903. The parsonage is a modest 1-1/2 story gable-front structure, with a single-story ell (a 20th-century addition) extending to the south.
