"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Chromatrope"", the article should at least have 250 words","A chromatrope is a type of magic lantern slide that produces dazzling, colorful geometrical patterns set in motion by rotating two painted glass discs in opposite directions, originally with a double pulley mechanism but later usually with a rackwork mechanism.

The chromatrope was probably invented in the year 1841 (or slightly earlier) by English glass painter and showman Henry Langdon Childe, by which year it was listed in the Royal Polytechnic Institution catalogue. It was added as a novelty to the program of the Royal Polytechnic Institution, which had previously included many other types of magic lantern shows with moving images, such as phantasmagoria and dissolving views.

The principle and the effect of the chromatrope is similar to that of the feux pyriques that had gained some popularity in rich North European households at the end of the 18th century. The resulting abstract and everchanging image is also very similar to that of the kaleidoscope, which had caused an enormous international craze in 1818.

Optical toys"," A chromatrope is an optical instrument that reflects a continuously moving spectrum of colors. It is sometimes called a ""color top"" or a ""rainbow top."" The chromatrope consists of a disk or a drum-shaped object with a series of holes or slits in the circumference. The holes are evenly spaced around the disk, and each hole has a different color. The disk is mounted on a rotating shaft. When the chromatrope is rotated, the holes or slits allow the user to view a continuously moving spectrum of colors. The speed of the moving spectrum can be controlled by adjusting the speed of the rotation. The chromatrope can be used as a scientific instrument to study the properties of light, or as a decorative item. It is often used as a demonstration tool in physics classrooms to show the separation of light into its constituent colors. The chromatrope is similar to the spectroscope, which is used to analyze the spectrum of light from a distant source. However, the chromatrope is used to generate a spectrum, rather than to analyze one.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,63664553,0.020253164556962022,0.08421052631578947,0.13328038125496425,0.03271028037383177,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0.035235307912289085,0.010132877304501187,0.0013808340237503453,0.009828009828009828,2,1,3,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,0,4,0,1,1

Lost comedy films"," The Great White Way is a 1924 American silent drama film directed by James Cruze and written by Frank Condon and James Cruze. The film stars Jack Holt, Aline MacMahon, Sam De Grasse, George Irving, and Jean Arthur. The film was released in both silent and sound versions, the latter featuring a musical score and sound effects. The film is set in New York City. Aline MacMahon plays Mary, a chorus girl who becomes involved with a powerful Broadway producer, and Jack Holt plays Pat, a lawyer who falls in love with her. George Irving plays the evil producing partner of Pat's, and Sam De Grasse plays the good producing partner. In the film, Pat struggles to save Mary from the influence of the wicked producer, and all the while, he must fight his own evil impulse to take the easy way out and compromise his principles. The film is notable for featuring an all-wax recording of George Gershwin playing his new piano preludes, and for being the film debut of Jean Arthur. The film is also notable for its dramatic irony: the ""great white way"" of the title is a slang term for Broadway, but in the film, the ""great white way"" is an analogy for the purity of the heroine, Mary, who is corrupted by the evil producer, and her salvation is the love of a good man, Pat.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,31508634,0.04339963833634718,0.06315789473684211,0.1618442452437687,0.11370716510903427,0,3,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0.03203396729902527,0.05181408371588403,0.012151339409003039,0.045454545454545456,4,1,4,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,7,1,1,1
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Richard Holden (British politician)"", the article should at least have 250 words","Richard John Holden (born 11 March 1985) is a British Conservative Party politician, who has served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for North West Durham since the 2019 general election. Holden is the first Conservative MP in the constituency's history. Prior to becoming an MP, he had worked as a special adviser in a number of government departments.

Early life and career
Holden was born in Blackburn, Lancashire, to Mark and Joan Holden. He grew up in Grindleton, a village in the Ribble Valley area. Holden attended Grindleton Primary School, Ermysted's Grammar School in Skipton and Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School in Blackburn. He then went to St Mary's College in the town, before studying at the London School of Economics. He graduated with a BSc in Government and History in 2007. Holden was employed as a waiter and bar staff for Emporium Ltd from 2002 to 2006.

Holden started work at Conservative Campaign Headquarters (CCHQ) in August 2007, initially as a Data Entry Officer. The following year, he became a Media Monitoring Officer, and was a Duty Press Officer from 2008 to 2010. Holden was Political Press Advisor from 2010 to 2012, and promoted to Deputy Head of Press in 2012.

At the 2015 general election he stood unsuccessfully as a Conservative candidate in the safe Labour seat of Preston. After the election, he became a special adviser to Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the House of Lords Baroness Stowell of Beeston, before leaving to work for Theresa May's 2016 Conservative Party leadership election campaign. He also worked for Stowell's successor as Leader of the House of Lords, Baroness Evans of Bowes Park, before becoming special adviser to the Secretary of State for Defence, Sir Michael Fallon, between October 2016 and April 2017.

Holden became a special adviser to former Secretary of State for Transport Chris Grayling in December 2018, before leaving to work on Boris Johnson's 2019 Conservative Party leadership election campaign. He then worked as a special adviser to Secretary of State for Education Gavin Williamson from August to November 2019. When Parliament was dissolved for the election, Holden began working for CCHQ, before being selected as a PPC for the Labour-held seat of North West Durham.

Parliamentary career 
Holden was elected as the MP for North West Durham at the 2019 general election with a majority of 1,144 votes. He is the first Conservative to represent the constituency. It had previously been considered a safe Labour seat as it had been represented by a member of that party ever since its re-establishment in 1950.

Holden has been a member of the Public Accounts Committee and the European Statutory Instruments Committee of the House of Commons since March 2020.

Since he became an MP he has written a fortnightly column for the political blog ConservativeHome. Holden was elected to the Executive of the 1922 Committee in July 2021.

Holden is on the committee of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Gambling-Related Harm  and has spoken and written extensively about his view that there must be tighter regulation of online gambling.

Work in Parliament

Requiring owners of vehicles to have a driving licence 
Following the death of his North West Durham constituent, Andrew Rowlands, Holden started a campaign with the Rowlands family to prevent people without driving licences from buying vehicles. Holden secured and spoke in a debate in Parliament on the issues in January 2022, at which the parents of Andrew Rowlands were present, and has pledged to keep working with Government until the law is changed to prevent further tragic deaths in such circumstances.

Draught Beer Duty

In March 2021, Holden led a group of 80 Conservative MPs in writing to the Chancellor of the Exchequer asking him to introduce a new lower duty for beer sold on draught in pubs. He continued his campaign alongside fellow Conservative MP Mike Wood with meetings with Treasury Ministers and in October 2021 gathered over 100 Conservative MPs to push the issues ahead of the 2021 Budget. At the 2021 Budget the Government announced a new Draught Beer Duty rate for pubs and clubs 5 per cent lower than standard beer duty, cutting the tax on beer and cider sold in pubs by £100 million a year. The Chancellor credited both Holden and Wood for campaigning on the issue in his Budget Speech.

Banning so-called Virginity Testing and Hymenoplasty 
In 2020 Holden heard about the practices of so-called virginity testing and hymenoplasty in a report on BBC Radio 1, and began looking at ways the law could be changed to ban them.  He then introduced a Private Member's Bill to ban the practices, but this fell at the end of the 2019-21 Parliamentary Session. Holden tabled two new clauses to the Health and Social Care Bill in the 2021-22 Parliamentary Session seeking to outlaw both so called 'virginity testing' and hymenoplasty. He received support for these amendments from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the Royal College of Midwives, as well as charities campaigning to ban the practices and MPs from all parties. 

Holden tabled the first amendments to the Health and Care Bill 2021 on 16th July 2021, to ensure that both practices were banned, receiving cross-party support for the changes. However, the Government's Violence Against Women and Girls Strategy had already been developing guidelines for many months on this issue. This was published in July 2021 , led by Home Secretary Priti Patel and Independent Advisor, Nimco Ali. It outlined the government's plans for the banning of virginity testing and also for setting up an expert group on banning hymenoplasty. In January 2022, the government confirmed that both of these abuses would indeed be banned.

Vehicle Excise Duty on Motorhomes 
Holden led a campaign to reverse the increase in Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) paid on new motorhomes. Erwin Hymer (formerly Elddis) based in Consett in Holden's constituency is a major manufacturer of motorhomes. The tax had been increased in September 2019 in response to EU regulation 2018/1832. In the March 2020 budget, Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak announced that the VED increase would be reversed, a tax cut worth £25 million a year to consumers and the industry.

Increasing Drugs Testing in Prisons 
Holden took on Cheryl Gillan's Private Member's Bill to extend the number of illegal drugs that could be tested for in prisons to include synthetic cannabinoids and other so called 'designer drugs' when Dame Cheryl was diagnosed with terminal cancer. The Bill was passed in March 2021.

Personal life
Holden lists his recreations as ""walking, country pubs, cooking, reading, Britpop"". He is a member of the Carlton Club in London and the Steel Club in Consett.

In May 2021 Holden was fined £100 for dropping a cigarette outside an election count venue during the 2021 local elections. He had previously urged constituents not to be ""litter tossers"".

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Ratt (EP)"", the article should at least have 250 words","Ratt is the first official record by American glam metal band Ratt. It was originally released on the band's Time Coast label, with the help of the band's manager Marshall Berle.

Background
The version of ""Back for More"" featured on this EP is an earlier recording than the one on the album Out of the Cellar. The European version also features an earlier recording of ""You're in Trouble"" as a bonus track, believed to feature Joey Cristofanilli on bass guitar. A cover of Rufus Thomas' ""Walkin' the Dog"" is also included, presumably as a nod to the 1973 Aerosmith version. It is also noted for the strong lead guitar presence of guitarist Robbin Crosby, whose trademark ""blues with a twist"" solos are prominent through the first four songs. An early version of ""Tell the World"" (which did not feature Blotzer or Croucier) was also featured on the compilation Metal Massacre, but was removed from later pressings. ""U Got It"" often opened the show circa 1983-84, and Pearcy did the same during his Nitronic 'Pure Hell' Tour in 2000.

In 1984, Atlantic Records remixed and re-released this EP following the success of Out of the Cellar. This reissue featured a glossier production mix to match the band's recent mainstream success, as well as an updated back cover photo of the group with a more pronounced Sunset Strip glam appearance.

The legs on the front cover belong to Tawny Kitaen, the then-girlfriend of guitarist Crosby. She later also posed on the cover of the band's 1984 album Out of the Cellar.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Philabundance"", the article should at least have 250 words","Philabundance is a non-profit food bank that serves the Philadelphia and Delaware Valley region of Pennsylvania, United States. It is the largest such organization in the region.

History
The organization was founded in 1984 by Pam Lawler. In the year 2005, it merged with The Greater Philadelphia Food Bank, and the new entity operates under the name Philabundance.

Goals
The organization aims to drive hunger from our communities today and end hunger forever.

Organization
Philabundance serves 90,000 people each week, 30% of whom are children, 15% of whom are seniors, and others served include students, the working poor, veterans and single parents. It has its own programs, as well as a network of 350 agencies, including emergency kitchens, shelters and soup kitchens. As of 2017, 1 in 8 people in the U.S. face hunger while in our area, that number is 1 in 5, making hunger a crisis in the Delaware Valley on which we need all need to collaborate to eradicate.

Philabundance works with local grocers and farmers to rescue perfectly good food that would otherwise go to waste; in 2016, it rescued 10 million pounds of food for its neighbors in need. The organization also hosts events alongside the Greater Philadelphia Coalition Against Hunger.

Trends
Clients Who Volunteer - Many of Philabundance's 15,000 volunteers are also clients, especially at its Fresh for All program. These volunteers spend 2–3 hours a week distributing food to others, while they themselves need help, and are allowed to take the same amount of food as those attending the program.

Hungry Students – Due to rising tuition, and the rules around qualifications for SNAP benefits, many college campuses are seeing a rise in the number of hungry students enrolled. As a result, many schools are opening pantries on campus to serve those in need. Philabundance's partner, the Chester County Food Bank, and other Feeding America food banks have partner with colleges to ensure this population has enough food to survive and thrive in school. Philabundance will soon follow suit.

Programs
 Fresh For All Program - To help families and individuals in need gain access to fresh vegetables and fruits, Philabundance operates Fresh For All Program at 9 locations in PA and NJ.
 Senior Boxes Program - Gives USDA-sponsored food boxes to approximately 5,000 low-income senior citizens.
 Philabundance Community Kitchen - A culinary, vocational job training program that teaches low-income and unemployed individuals life and job-readiness skills.
 Grocers Against Hunger- a food rescue program that allows participating grocers to donate surplus inventory to Philabundance. The food is later distributed to clients through direct service programs. In 2015, the program saved 10 million pounds of produce that would have otherwise gone to waste.
 KidsBites - The KidsBites initiative provides access to nutritious food in low-income areas for children and their families to help ensure that kids in our service area have the food they need to thrive and grow. Since its inception, KidsBites has provided almost 250,000 pounds of food to children and their families. To meet the needs and size of different communities, Philabundance offers several program models: Mobile pantry; BackPacks; and LunchBoxes.

Contributions Received
A multitude of generous individuals, foundations and corporations support Philabundance. Following are some of the largest annual contributions:
  Phans Feeding Families: The Philadelphia Phillies and the Citizens Bank, sponsor the annual Phans Feeding Families program, which consists of a night at the ballpark at which there are raffles and fundraisers to benefit Philabundance, as well as food collections at AT&T station and Citizens Bank Park. As part of its support of Phans, Citizen Bank makes an annual donation of $40,000 to support Philabundance' KidsBites initiative.
 SEPTA Stop Hunger at Your Station - The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) supports Philabundance annually, by collecting food at more than 40 SEPTA stations. Stations also collected money, leading to tens of thousands of meals for our neighbors in need.
 93.3 WMMR's Preston & Steve Camp Out for Hunger – Every year since 1998, Preston & Steve hold a five-day ""Camp Out for Hunger"" event – most recently, at Xfinity Live! This is the largest single-location food drive in the county, raising more than 2.6 million pounds of food and $200,000 in 2019's drive and over 14 million pounds in since its inception. The event was aimed at increasing hunger awareness, as well as collecting food for Philabundance. The event featured popular bands and distinguished guests showing their support for Philabundance. Keeping with tradition, Preston and Steve camp at the spot in a trailer all through the week.

Food banks in Pennsylvania"," Philabundance Philabundance, formerly known as The Greater Philadelphia Food Bank, is the region's largest hunger relief organization, serving more than 600,000 people each week through its 350+ nonprofit partners. In 2019, Philabundance distributed over 24 million pounds of food, including over 1.4 million pounds of fresh produce, to people in need in Philadelphia, Delaware, and South Jersey. Philabundance was founded in 1984 by an organization called Share, which was formed by a group of women volunteering at a local soup kitchen. The Greater Philadelphia Food Bank distributed over 6 million pounds of food in its first year, and expanded its services to include programs such as Pantries On Wheels (POW), a mobile food pantry; the Capital For Hunger Campaign, which raises money to buy fresh produce; and the Philabundance Community Kitchen, which prepares hot meals for people in need. Philabundance is a member of Feeding America, a national network of food banks. It is also a member of the Pennsylvania Association of Nonprofit Organizations and the Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce. In 2013, Philabundance merged with The Food Bank of South Jersey, which allowed the organization to expand its service area to include Burlington, Camden, and Gloucester counties in New Jersey. In 2015, Philabundance opened its new headquarters in Philadelphia's Navy Yard. The new facility allowed the organization to increase its distribution capacity to over 30 million pounds of food per year. In 2018, Philabundance changed its name to Philabundance to better reflect its mission of fighting hunger in the Philadelphia region.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,29878986,0.12074001947419669,0.07368421052631578,0.2896275024948575,0.14641744548286603,1,5,0,0,3,1,0,1,0,1,0.23589269501274365,0.04582209044132601,0.004971002485501243,0.05773955773955774,5,0,9,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,6,1,12,1,1,1
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Slavink"", the article should at least have 250 words","Slavink is a Dutch meat dish consisting usually of ground meat called ""half and half"" (half beef, half pork) wrapped in bacon (the Dutch equivalent of bacon is, however, not smoked), and cooked in butter or vegetable oil for about 15 minutes. A variation of the dish called blinde vink is made by wrapping ground veal in a thin veal cutlet. Slavinken and blinde vinken are usually prepared and bought at the butchery or the supermarket; a standard slavink, before cooking, weighs around 100 grams. The bacon is ""glued"" to the filling with transglutaminase, an enzyme that bonds proteins (and is usually extracted from animal blood).

The slavink was first created by Butcher Jaap Boerwinkel in Amersfoort, and subsequently given its name by butcher Spoelder in Laren, which won him an award, the ""Golden Butcher's Ring."" Originally, the filling of a slavink was made from smoked sausage. The term ""slavink"" loosely translates to Lettucefinch. The term is probably an abbreviation of slagersvink, that is, a ""finch"" prepared by the butcher (""slager"").

The slavink often emblematizes traditional Dutch cuisine, as in the book De taal van de verpleging, a Dutch-language guide for non-native nurses working in the Netherlands, and is especially favored by the older generations.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Ethnodoxology"", the article should at least have 250 words","Ethnodoxology is an application of ethnomusicology, ethnic arts studies, worship studies, missiology, and related disciplines.

Those in this field study local musical traditions and work with local musicians and churches to adapt and develop locally created musical forms for Christian worship. Examples of such work include engaging a local praise singer in translating and singing Mary's Magnificat, developing local hymns, leading people in creating localized forms of liturgy, sharing examples of starting points for people interested in utilizing local arts but not knowing where to start. A broad resource for those in the field is a pair of volumes: Worship and Mission for the Global Church: An Ethnodoxology Handbook and its how-to companion Creating Local Arts Together: A Manual to Help Communities Reach their Kingdom Goals.

The International Council of Ethnodoxologists define ethnodoxology as;

""the theological and anthropological study, and practical application, of how every culture group might use its unique and diverse artistic expressions appropriately to worship the God of the Bible.""

The term was coined by Dave Hall, a pioneer of the school of ethnodoxology and founder of Worship From The Nations.

Hall states;

I define ethnodoxology as ""the study of the worship of God among diverse cultures"" or, more precisely, ""the theological and practical study of how and why people of diverse cultures praise and glorify the true and living God as revealed in the Bible."" The term finds its source in 2 Biblical Greek words. ""Ethno,"" from the Greek word ""ethne"" meaning 'peoples' or 'people groups' and ""doxology,"" from the Greek word ""doxos"" meaning 'glory' or 'praise.'

Ethnomusicology
Christian music"," Ethnodoxology is the study of the relationship between the Christian faith and the cultural forms that shape and express it. It is a portmanteau of the words ""ethnography"" and ""doxology"". The word ""ethnography"" is used in the anthropological sense of a description of the beliefs and practices of a particular culture, in this case, the Christian culture. ""Doxology"" refers to the beliefs and practices that are expressed in the cultural forms. In some ways, ethnodoxology can be seen as the study of ""what the church sings when it praises God in a particular language and culture"". The term was coined in 1964 by the Brazilian Catholic priest, composer, and musician Orlando distribution, who was the founder of the anthropological school of thinking about music in the Catholic Church that is known as ""ethnodoxology"". Orlando was an assistant to the famous Brazilian anthropologist Roberto da Matta, and, as a musician, he was influenced by the musicologist Jacques Ibert. Together with other Brazilian musicians, Orlando developed the field of study known today as ""ethnodoxology"", with a particular concern for the relationship between music, faith, and culture. ethnodoxology has also been strongly influenced by the Chicago school of musicology, whose concern for the relationship between social context and musical form is reflected in the work of scholars such as George List and Nelson Goodfellow. The basic concern of ethnodoxology is the relationship between music, faith, and culture. It is a branch of musicology, but with a particular focus on the relationship between musical forms and the cultural and religious context in which they are created and performed.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,11512716,0.020253164556962022,0.08421052631578947,0.10743976701085518,0.16510903426791276,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0.11431629433297714,0.027088817782806914,0.0040044186688760015,0.022113022113022112,5,0,4,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,9,1,1,1
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Jane Thorne"", the article should at least have 250 words","Jane Mary  Thorne, baronne de Pierres (1821 – 1873) was a French courtier of American origin. She served as lady-in-waiting (dame de Palais) to the empress of France, Eugénie de Montijo.

Life
Jane Thorne was born in New York as the daughter of the American millionaire Colonel Herman Thorne and Jane Mary Jauncey. Her father was a well known figure in the American millionaire colony in Paris during the reign of Louis Philippe I. She married the French nobleman Eugène Stéphane de Pierres, baron de Pierres, on 7 June 1842. Her two sisters, Mary and Alice, married respectively French aristocrats Baron Camille de Varaigne (on 28 March 1832) and Count Amédée d'Audebert de Férussac (on 27 August 1845).  

After the introduction of the Second Empire and the marriage of Emperor Napoleon III to Eugénie de Montijo, she was appointed to the Household of the new Empress. The ladies-in-waiting of the new Empress consisted of a Grand-Maitresse or senior lady-in-waiting, the Princesse d'Essling; a Dame d'honneur or deputy, the Duchesse de Bassano, who both attended court on grand functions; and six (later twelve) Dame du Palais, who were selected from among the acquaintances to the Empress prior to her marriage, and who alternated in pairs fulfilling the daily duties.  Her husband was appointed equerry to the Empress.  Both she and her spouse kept their positions from 1853 to 1870.

Jane Thorne was a personal friend of Eugenie from before her marriage to the emperor. She was referred to as a great beauty, but also as a shy, introverted neurotic.  

The empress was reportedly charmed by her American accent, but also irritated by her smoking, as she had the habit of blowing the smoke in to the empress' face.  
Empress Eugenie often spoke English with Jane Thorne, because she wanted to keep up her English. A contemporary said of her:
""Miss Thorne spoke English with just a slight touch of the best American accent and some of the words which she had brought with her from the other side of the Atlantic — especially that picturesque American slang, which she sometimes employed with much effect in her lively conversation — had a special charm for the Empress [...] I think it was largely due to this fascinating American woman that her fellow countrymen and women always had such a warm welcome at the Court of the Tuileries.""

Jane Thorne was described as an excellent rider, and often accompanied the empress during riding or hunting, along with her husband, the equerry. 
A contemporary described her: 
""She was the finest horsewoman, and yet the most timid person I ever knew; the least trifle terrified her. She had bet very pretty and was exceedingly sweet and amiable.""

Legacy
She belongs to the ladies-in-waiting depicted with Eugenie in the famous painting Empress Eugénie Surrounded by her Ladies in Waiting by Franz Xaver Winterhalter from 1855.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""The Song of Songs (play)"", the article should at least have 250 words","The Song of Songs is a 1914 play written by Edward Sheldon, based on the 1908 German novel Das hohe Lied by Hermann Sudermann, which had been translated to English under the title The Song of Songs. Producer A. H. Woods staged the play on Broadway at his Eltinge 42nd Street Theatre, where it was a box office success. The play was the basis of several movie and radio adaptations.

Plot

Shop girl Lily Kardos marries Senator Calkins, but secretly continues to see her ex-lover Richard Laird on the side. Calkins abandons Lily when he discovers her infidelity. Lily then begins a relationship with Stephen Bennett. Stephen's uncle Phineas, aware of Lily's reputation, gets her drunk at a party to reveal the truth about her to Stephen. Her inappropriate behavior causes Stephen to break up with her. In the final act, she returns to Richard Laird.

Cast and characters

The characters and cast from the Broadway production are given below:

Reception

The play received a mixed reception from critics. The New York Times said the Broadway production was well-acted and ""deeply interesting"", but was also too long, flawed, and generally inferior to the novel. The Brooklyn Daily Eagle also complimented the acting, but said the play's primary draw was ""sensationalism"" that would ""attract the mentally depraved"".

The drama critic for Life magazine said the play served only to ""pique depraved curiosity"". Drama critic Walter Prichard Eaton said Sheldon made a critical error in moving the location of the story from Europe to America, thereby making some of the characters' actions less plausible.

Adaptations

In 1918, Famous Players-Lasky produced a silent film adaptation of The Song of Songs, directed by Joseph Kaufman and starring Elsie Ferguson. This movie is now considered a lost film. In 1924, the same studio remade the story under the title Lily of the Dust, directed by Dimitri Buchowetzki and starring Pola Negri. This film is also lost.

In 1933, Paramount Pictures (the successor of Famous Players-Lasky) made a sound version of The Song of Songs, directed by Rouben Mamoulian and starring Marlene Dietrich. On December 20, 1937, Dietrich reprised her role in a radio play presented by the Lux Radio Theatre on the CBS Radio Network.

Plays based on novels"," The Song of Songs (play) The Song of Songs is a romantic play by American writer Sheldon Harnason. It is based on the biblical story of the Song of Solomon, also known as the Song of Songs or Canticles. The play's title is taken from the first line of the Bible, ""The Song of Songs, which is Solomon's."" The play is set in the court of King Solomon. The king is old, and the action revolves around his search for a successor. The queen, Bathya, is a strong-willed, powerful woman, and the king's chief wife. She is concerned for the future of her son, Prince David, the heir apparent. The king's other wives, Naamah and Abishag, are lesser figures, although Abishag has a romantic relationship with the king. The king's main concern is the disposition of his wealth. He has accumulated vast amounts of gold, and he worries that his successor will not be able to keep it together. The king's wealth is the cause of much of the action in the play. The king's closest advisor, Benjamin, is the keeper of the king's wealth. The king's other advisor, Nathan, is the royal prophet. The king's two sons, David and Absalom, are in line to succeed him. David is the elder, and is married to the princess from Tyre, Taphath. Absalom is the younger, and is married to the princess from Egypt, Othniel. The king's other possible successor is his brother, Adonijah. Adonijah is not married, and is the king's favorite. The play is set in the months leading up to the king's death.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Frédéric Samuel Cordey"", the article should at least have 250 words","Frédéric Samuel Cordey (1854–1911) was a French landscape painter who was a part of the Impressionist movement. He was a close friend of Auguste Renoir, and had a personal fortune that allowed him to work according to his taste, regardless of the publicity and support provided by art dealers.

Life and work 

A student of Isidore Pils and Gustave Boulanger, Cordey was part of a group that revolted against the teachings of his teachers with his friend Pierre Franc Lamy. Cordey quickly abandoned traditional painting to follow the path of the Impressionists and exhibited four paintings Rue à Montmartre (""Street in Montmartre""), Le Pont des Saints-Pères (""Bridge at Saints-Pères""), le Séchoir (""The Dryer"", Chantilly), Pêcheur (""Fisherman"", sketch) with them in 1877.

In 1881, Gustave Caillebotte informed Camille Pissarro that he wanted Cordey to exhibit with the Impressionists, but that year Cordey was in Algiers with André Lhote. Cordey exhibited his work at the Salon des indépendants in 1884.

Cordey was close to Renoir and was one of his most loyal companions. Cordey appeared in several paintings by the master painter, for example, the Bal du moulin de la galette (""Dance at Le moulin de la Galette"") and La Conversation (""The Conversation""). Auguste Renoir's son, Jean, reported a theory of Cordey's which appealed a lot to his father: ""Painters, like gymnasts, must keep in shape. They must keep a clear sight, precise movements, and good legs to go meet the landscape.""

Cordey was a great admirer of the musician François Cabaner. To help him as he was poor and dying, Cordey (like other artists) gave one of his works, to be auctioned and raise funds. Paul Cézanne mentioned the list of the offered works in a letter to his friend Émile Zola. He also admired Nina de Callias and Léon Dierx, whose portraits he drew. Cordey's painting Léon Dierx, prince des poètes (""Léon Dierx, prince of poets"") was purchased by Georges Viau in 1899.

Attentive to landscapes, he stayed close to Camille Pissarro in Neuville-sur-Oise and Éragny. He participated in the Salon d'automne from its inception in 1903 until 1908. He was named a member of the Salon in 1904, where he exhibited six of his paintings.

Cordey exhibited ten paintings at the Salon in 1906, including six of the banks of the Oise. He exhibited rarely, however, the art critics Adolphe Tabarant, Paul Alexis, and Gustave Geffroy were very eulogistic in the preface to the retrospective exhibition of Cordey in 1913-1914 at Choiseul Gallery. Adolphe Thalasso praised Cordey's landscapes from Eragny in a February 1914 report in L'Art et les Artistes (""Art and Artists"").

The park is named after a Indian woman who lived along the river in the early 20th century. The park's main feature is a beach along the river, which is a popular destination for boaters, swimmers, and anglers. The park also includes a trailhead for the Pacific Northwest National Scenic Trail, which passes through the park on its way to the Canadian border. Indian Mary Park is located on the south bank of the Pend Oreille River, just east of the mouth of the Kalispel River. The park encompasses 3 acres (1.2 ha) and is one of two state parks in Washington to be located on an Indian reservation, the other being Tiger Mountain State Forest. The park is managed by the Kalispel Tribe, who also manage the nearby Kalispel Casino. The park is named after Mary Curley, an Indian woman who lived along the river in a log cabin for many years until her death in 1952. The cabin was located on the west side of the river, just north of the park's current location. The park's beach is a popular destination for boaters, swimmers, and anglers, and is also a launch point for boat tours of the river. The park's main trailhead is the starting point for the Pacific Northwest National Scenic Trail, which passes through the park on its way to the Canadian border. In 2015, the Kalispel Tribe proposed a land swap with the state of Washington in which they would acquire Indian Mary Park and the state would acquire other lands from the tribe.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Wang Yi (librarian)"", the article should at least have 250 words","Wang Yi (; c. CE 89–158), courtesy name Shushi (), was a Chinese poet during the Eastern Han dynasty who was employed in the Imperial Library by the Later Han  emperor Shun Di (reigned CE 125 – 144). Wang Yi is known for his work on the poetry anthology Chu Ci. Although with varying reliability, his commentaries on this work are a main source of information regarding some of its often obscure textual references.

Biography
Wang Yi was born in the former territory of the State of Chu, in what is now Yicheng, Hubei. (Hawkes, 2011 [1985]: 28 and 307) Chu had existed as an independent political entity for many centuries, and for much of that time as one of the major regional powers, until its defeat in BCE 223, by Qin, some four centuries before the birth of Wang Yi. The Qin political unification of China by military conquest was followed by a deliberate policy of enforcing cultural uniformity throughout the new empire. Still, his associations with the former Chu region gave Wang an advantage in terms of explaining some of the dialectic words or the customs of Chu. (Hawkes, 2011 [1985]: 28)

Family
Wang Yi had a son, Wang Yanshou, a poet. One of Yanshou's poems, ""The Nightmare"", was translated by Arthur Waley, in Chinese Poems.

Works
Wang Yi's main known works are his introductory commentaries on the Chu Ci and its individual works as well as his original poetry written in the Chu Ci style. (Hawkes, 2011 [1985]: 28) Although Wang Yi is sometimes attributed as selecting and compiling the Chu Ci in its present form, he himself specifically denies this, attributing the compilation instead to Liu Xiang, except for his own original contributions. (Hawkes, 2011 [1985]: 30) (And, it turns out, this does not include the commentaries on Wang's own Chu Ci imitations. (Hawkes, 2011 [1985]: 28)) 
Also, the order in which the Chu Ci  material is presented in modern editions dates from the tenth or eleventh centuries at the earliest, when Wang Yi's edition was rearranged. (Hawkes, 2011 [1985]: 30)

Wang Yi wrote nine poems in the Chu Ci style, which he contributed as part of his Chu Ci anthology, adding them on to the book's end, as the custom was in such a case. (Hawkes, 2011 [1985]: 31) These poems appear under the collective title of Nine Longings (Jiu si), in the seventeenth and final major section (juan) of the Chu Ci anthology. In terms of quality, these works by Wang Yi have nowhere near the fame and acclaim of ""On Encountering Trouble"" (Li Sao), or some of the other poems: David Hawkes describes Wang's ""Nine Longings"" poems as ""not very inspired verses"". (Hawkes, 2011 [1985]: 28)

Wang Yi is also known for writing in the fu style which was typically popular during the Han Dynasty, one example being his ""Fu on the Lychee"" ().

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Acer Aspire One"", the article should at least have 250 words","Acer Aspire One is a line of netbooks first released in July 2008 by Acer Inc.

Many characteristics of a particular model of Acer Aspire One are dictated by the CPU platform chosen.  Initial models were based on the Intel Atoms.  Later, models with various AMD chips were introduced.  Newer versions of the Atom were adopted as well.

Early versions were based on the Intel Atom platform, which consists of the Intel Atom processor, Intel 945GSE Express chipset and Intel 82801GBM (ICH7M) I/O controller, and is available in several shell colors: seashell white, sapphire blue, golden brown, onyx black, and coral pink.

Higher end models were released in June 2010 consisting of the AMD Athlon II Neo processor and ATI Radeon HD 4225 graphics controller. These are available in onyx black, antique brass, or mesh black shells depending on model.  Also released was a version of the Aspire One 521 with an AMD-V105 processor running at 1.2 GHz, an ATI Radeon 4225 graphics controller, and equipped with a HDMI port.

A range of later models were powered by AMD Brazos APUs (combined CPU/GPU chips).  The AMD chips had much more powerful video capabilities but consumed more power.

Its main competitor in the low-cost netbook market was the Asus Eee PC line.

In January 2013, Acer officially ended production of their Aspire One series due to declining sales as a result of consumers favoring tablets and Ultrabooks over netbooks.

History

The line was originally manufactured for Acer Inc. by Quanta Computer.; Quanta was phased out as a supplier to Acer, and production of the Acer Aspire One line shifted to other manufacturers in 2009. Also starting in 2009, eSobi Inc. partnered with Acer to preload the eSobi News Center on Acer Aspire One netbooks beginning in the first quarter of 2009.

Operating systems

Windows

Windows XP Home Edition SP3 is installed on the models with a name ending in X, or ending in B followed by another letter denoting color.

It is also possible to install and run Windows Vista or Windows 7 on the earlier model laptop. In high-end versions appearing during 2009, Windows Vista is pre-installed. The lack of a DVD-ROM drive requires creating a bootable USB flash drive (the on-board card reader slots are not bootable) using a USB external DVD drive or PXE boot network install.

Windows 7 Starter is installed by default on models with a name starting in D such as D255E and D257 as well as other later Aspire models.

Linux

Models with names starting in L, or ending in A followed by a letter for color, are shipped with Linpus Linux Lite, which is based on Fedora 8.  This offers a simplified user interface, with default applications like the Firefox 2 browser, OpenOffice.org 2.3, Acer One Mail and Acer One Messenger available directly on the main screen. The default desktop environment has been designed to hide advanced features from the user and to prevent modification. It is possible to modify the system to present a more traditional Xfce 4 desktop, enable more advanced features such as context menus, or install additional software.

It is possible to install and run other Linux distributions on the Acer Aspire One, and some specially customised Linux distributions have been designed to offer out-of-the-box functionality. These include:
Joli OS
Ubuntu Netbook Edition (UNE)
Linux4One
Kuki Linux

Mac OS X

Through the OSx86 project, an Aspire One can boot and run a modified version of Mac OS X, including iAtkos, iDeneb, ""XxX"" and Kalyway distributions. This procedure is not supported by Apple or Acer.

FreeBSD

FreeBSD v. 8.2 is known to run on the Acer Aspire One, although some limitations apply: lid close not starting a hibernate, and power management which works to a very limited degree.

OpenBSD

OpenBSD releases ranging from 4.4 to 6.4 are known to run on some of the many models of Aspire One, with some limitations based on BIOS and other variations.

Android

Some models are dual boot (e.g. D250, D260), with Android 1.6 and Windows 7 Starter.  The computer boots up into Android first, with a tab to select Windows.  The Android-x86 OS has limited apps available to it.

FreeDOS

It is possible to install FreeDOS on even the earliest models. Some peripherals, like a USB mouse or Ethernet port, will not be detected by the standard setup and may require manual tweaking.

Storage

Solid state drives

The A110 model ships with an 8 GB or 16 GB solid-state drive (SSD), although some models do not come with one. Early 8 GB models come with the Intel Z-P230, model SSDPAMM0008G1. This SSD has been criticized for its slow read and write speed. Intel lists the drive's maximum speeds as 38 MB/s read and 10 MB/s write. Later models come with the slightly faster Samsung P-SSD 1800.

Hard disks

The hard disk is a regular 2.5-in 5400 rpm SATA drive with 80, 120, 160, 250, 320, 500 or 750 GB. A number of different drives from different manufacturers have been reported to be included. Newer-model Aspire Ones take a 7 mm thick drive, as opposed to the usual 9.5 mm thickness that makes up most 2.5-inch form factor hard drives and SSDs.

Expansion slot

There is also an SD/SDHC storage expansion slot on all models for additional storage (the 533 model does not support SDHC as verified by Acer support UK).  On Linux versions this automatically expands the space of the SSD or HDD using aufs.  Windows XP models treat it as a normal removable drive.

Some models have a second slot that functions as a standard multi-in-1 flash memory card reader.  The 110 BIOS does not allow one to boot an operating system from this slot, but the 150 BIOS is capable of booting from an SDHC card in the slot.  (Note: with Linux, it is possible essentially to boot from HD or USB by using a /boot partition on the regular boot device and an initrd that loads the real OS from the slot).

Power management

The Intel Atom platform has a specified maximum TDP of 11.8 W. Individual figures are 2.5 W for the N270 processor, 6 W for the 945GSE chipset and 3.3 W for the 82801GBM I/O controller.  The AUO B089AW01 LCD panel is rated at a maximum power consumption of 3 W.  Typical read–write power consumption for the SSD is around 0.3 W, and 0.01 W when idle. The different HDDs are rated at about 1.5–2.5 W for read–write operations and around 0.7 W when idle.

The official ratings for the battery are up to 3 hours for the three cell, and up to 8 hours for the six cell.  Linpus Linux Lite has been optimized by Acer for lower power consumption. Battery life is shorter on HDD configurations with Windows XP, at approximately 2.5 hours for the three cell.  Although the standard three cell battery is 2.2 Ah, some users have reported 2.4 Ah and 2.9 Ah batteries from the factory.  Various suppliers online now carry aftermarket batteries, including the six cell. Aftermarket nine cell batteries are available though they are quite heavy, and also protrude out of the back, reducing the aesthetics but improving airflow.

Specifications

An Acer AOD model (10.1"" screen) product comparison guide, in the form of a spreadsheet file download, is available from increa.com.

Additional hardware

Since November 2008 the 3G-enabled model Aspire One A150X-3G is available in Europe, while models with 3G modems began shipping in the United Kingdom in December of the same year and were denoted by the letter G in their model number. The first generation Aspire One webcam is an Acer Labs International M5608 camera controller with attached 0.3 MP SuYin or 1.3 MP LiteOn CMOS sensor.

Some models of the Aspire One use an Intel 945GSE chipset which only supports 2 GB of RAM. Installing memory modules larger than 2 GB has caused the Aspire to fail the power-on self-test.  Model 522, featuring the AMD Fusion C-50 chip, has been reported to work with 4 GB installed (although the included Windows 7 Starter edition has an artificially imposed 2 GB limit).

AO751h (751h)

The AO751h has the larger 11.6"" screen with an LED backlit display and a 1366x768 native resolution. It includes a 1 GB/667 MHz DDR2 533 MHz SDRAM memory option (2 GB being the maximum), a 160 GB HDD option, Bluetooth option, Intel northbridge US15W, and an OS option for Windows Vista Home Basic edition or Windows XP Media Center Edition. All AO751h units are powered by an Intel Atom Z520 processor running at 1330 MHz (or 1240 MHz in first version). The US15W system controller incorporates a GMA500 video core. The AO751h has a dual power (AC/DC) option. The six cell battery provides the working time of about 8 hours. Besides the mentioned specifications of the AO751h it supports 10/100 Mbit/s Ethernet interface, 802.11g Wi-Fi card Atheros, Bluetooth 2.1, standard VGA-out jack, 3 USB 2.0 ports, a Memory Card reader 5:1 (xD-Picture Card, SD card), as well as Microphone In jack 3.5 mm (1/8"" Mini), Headphone Out jack 3.5 mm (1/8"" Mini). One of the cons is the relatively small TouchPad and mouse buttons. Large and comfortable keyboard is one of the distinguishing features of the device.

There have been reports of some AO751h units randomly freezing, which has led to recalls in Denmark.  Some users have reported that having their motherboards replaced by Acer solved the problem and Acer officially reporting that the fix is to install an updated BIOS.

AOA150 speaker vibration and other issues
The 8.9"" models have an improperly designed speaker location that causes vibration to the internal hard drive, causing it to be problematic. The right speaker is especially prone to this. Audio frequencies around 1 kHz cause the hard drive to almost stop responding. Full volume MP3/audio playback easily causes these models to run extremely slowly, or crash because of unresponsive disk I/O. This problem also causes bad sectors, crashed hard drives and corrupt Windows partitions in the long term. Even sound from an external speaker with 1 kHz tone test causes this hard drive behaviour. SSD drives do not suffer from this problem. Workarounds identified are: listening to music at a lower volume, using only the left speaker, using a software equalizer to tone down the 1 kHz frequency, replacing the hard drive with an SSD, and trying to install soft sound dampening material around the speakers and the hard drive.

Aspire One Happy

The Acer Aspire One Happy is a 10.1 inch netbook with different operating systems: (Android 2.1 and Windows 7). It was launched by Acer Inc. in November 2010. The computer is nearly identical to the Acer Aspire One D255. The main difference is that the Happy case comes in several different color options (comes in Candy pink, Lavender purple, Lime green and Hawaii blue). It is powered by Intel Atom N450 or dual-core Intel Atom N550, with up to 2 GB RAM and Intel Graphics Media Accelerator 3150. There is also a 3G version for proper portability, with each model measuring 24 mm thick and weighing 1.25 kg with a six-cell battery pack.

In mid–2011, the ""Acer Aspire One Happy 2"" line was released. This model may have bluetooth on board.  It seems that some countries ship this newer model with bluetooth while others do not.
This seems to depend which wireless card they shipped with, some can in fact be replaced as the BIOS should not be card specific.
The functionality uses an internal USB bus on miniPCIe slot specification but not all have these pins connected.
A good way to check is find a miniPCIe to USB3 card and see if the device is recognized or not.

Acer Aspire One D270

The Acer Aspire One D270 netbook is the first 10-inch Acer netbook to feature a 1.6 GHz Intel Atom N2600 dual core processor and running Windows 7 Starter 32-bit. The AOD270-1186, the white models, feature an Intel Atom N2600 dual core processor with 1 MB L2 cache, 1.6 GHz processor and Hyper Threading technology. The AOD270-1410, the black model, features a 10.1 inch WSVGA LED-backlit display with CrystalBrite technology with a 17:10 aspect ratio and 1024 x 600 resolution display, 1 GB DDR3 SDRAM memory, a 320 GB 5400 rpm hard drive and integrated Intel GMA 3600 graphics with 64 MB dedicated memory.

In Europe, the Acer Aspire One D270-26Ckk NU.SGAED.011 is running Linpus Linux and comes in an ""espresso black"" color. It also includes 2 GB of RAM, and a 320 GB hard drive. With Linux, this netbook becomes a bit faster than its Windows 7 counterpart.

Although Intel specifies the maximum RAM capability of the N2600 as 2 GB, numerous users have reported a 4 GB SODIMM works well in the D270, with 2.99 GB reported usable by Windows 7 Home Premium 32 bit (after upgrading from Starter).

Some models of the Acer Aspire One D270 have Windows 7 Home Basic pre-installed and have an Intel Atom N2800 1.86 GHz processor.

Some more recent AOA's can be upgraded to 4GB 1.5V RAM if they use DDR3 and the 64 bit CPU; though this is not a recommended upgrade path it  works on the D270 -26Dbb and the modification was medium term stable on the test machine running x64 Windows 7 Home using SDR#. It is believed that many other inexpensive VT64x equipped DDR3 netbooks have the same capability but disabled for licensing reasons or due to the clock circuitry being unable to handle certain modules correctly resulting in system instability, that can be overcome using spdtool and slightly altering timing parameters.

There are known issues with the WiFi in the D270 over time, which sometimes occur after the card is changed. Putting the OEM one back in does not resolve this problem and symptoms include the Fn + F3 not working. Further investigation suggests that the issue may be BIOS corruption and replacing or reflashing the chip may well resolve it but as of yet this is untested. The D270 is known to have SPECTRE/Meltdown vulnerabilities but this may be patched at a later date with a third party BIOS.

Reception

CNET editors' review has been positive, although held reservations as the Aspire One is early to market and many netbooks are planned for the near future.

A The Tech Report (Techreport.com) review of the 751h, and the similar Gateway LT3103U, was generally positive, praising the notebooks' battery life but criticizing the large number of third party software products preinstalled and running by default on the computers.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Hinduism in Portugal"", the article should at least have 250 words","There is relatively little history of active practice of Hinduism in Portugal. Presently there is a Hindu community of approximately 9,000 persons, which largely traces its origins to Indians who emigrated from the former Portuguese colonies of Lusophone Africa, particularly from Mozambique, and from the former colony of Diu, Daman and Goa and other possessions in Portuguese India.

From the mid 1990s on there was an influx of Hindus of Nepalese origin in Portugal as a result of labour migration originated from that South Asian country. Also since the 1990s it is possible to find in Lisbon a small Hare Krishna community, consisting mainly of Caucasians of Portuguese origin, but also Brazilian and devotes from other European countries.

Hindus in Portugal are, according to the Indian Embassy in Lisbon, mainly Gujaratis (Gujarati is taught at the Hindu Community Cultural Centre, in Lisbon), Punjabis and Goans. The majority of the Hindus live in the capital city, Lisbon, but it is also possible to find some Hindu-Gujarati families living in Oporto.

Hindu groups in Portugal

Gujaratis moved to Mozambique under colonial rule, and after the independence of that country in 1974, some of them moved to Portugal (particularly to Lisbon). Since the 1980s, Gujaratis have migrated to Portugal directly from their homeland in Gujarat and the island of Diu.

Goans first emigrated to Portugal in 1961, following the action of the Indian armed forces and subsequent liberation of Goa, Damão & Diu to India. They also built up a community in Mozambique before its independence, and then moved to Portugal. A liberal immigration policy and citizenship given to families of former Portuguese subjects in Goa has allowed their numbers to rise in Portugal.

Daman, Diu, Dadra and Nagar Haveli Hindus have been present in Portugal since slightly before the annexation of those territories in 1954 and 1961. Punjabis, who were subjects of British rather than Portuguese colonialism, have recently begun emigration to Portugal.

Religion in Portugal"," Hinduism in Portugal Hinduism is a minority religion in Portugal, followed by 0.09% of the population according to the 2021 Census. Hindus are a religious minority in Portugal, and have been since Portuguese traders established contact with India. The first Indians to arrive in Portugal were likely lascars, or Indian seamen travelling with Portuguese ships. Lascars are documented as living in Portuguese settlements in India from the 1500s, and a few were taken back to Portugal as slaves. A small number of Hindus are also believed to have arrived in Portugal during the British Raj. While the majority of Portuguese Hindus are Tamil, there are also people of other Indian ethnicities, such as Goan and Bombayis, as well as Portuguese people of Indian descent. Most Portuguese Hindus are concentrated in the Lisbon metropolitan area, in the Portuguese capital Lisbon, and in the city of Porto. The Portuguese Constitution of 1976 recognised Hinduism as a religion and it is covered by the legal framework of freedom of religion. There are around 24,000 Hindus in Portugal, according to the 2021 Census.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,8819814,0.0719520319786809,0.06315789473684211,0.1335925198221925,0.03271028037383177,7,7,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.13803353425753812,0.014128700344972012,0.004142502071251036,0.012285012285012284,17,0,5,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,1,18,1,1,1
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Overton Loyd"", the article should at least have 250 words","Overton Loyd (born April 20, 1954) is an American artist best known for creating the cover art for the Parliament album Motor Booty Affair and several other records. His style of art varies often from work to work, and can range from loose sketches and paintings to fully fleshed out pieces.  He is a friend of George Clinton of Parliament, and most of the subjects for his art are either Clinton or Parliament.

Loyd's contribution to Motor Booty Affair was considerable. The original LP was released in several different configurations. The main release consisted of a gate-fold album cover, with Loyd's artwork on the front and back covers. His illustrations included cartoon portraits of some of the ""characters"" mentioned in the songs on the album, including ""Mr. Wiggles the Worm."" There was also a picture disk, with Loyd's illustration printed directly on the vinyl LP. Finally, there was a special edition that included cardboard cutout figures featuring Loyd's cartoon illustrations of most of the characters mentioned in the songs.

When Parliament went on tour in support of Motor Booty Affair, Loyd designed costumes for members of the band based on the cartoon illustrations he had made for the album cover.

In 1977, Loyd illustrated a comic book that was included in Parliament's Funkentelechy Vs. the Placebo Syndrome, portraying the epic battle between Sir Nose D’Voidoffunk and Starchild (see P-Funk mythology).  In the cartoon, which echoes the lyrics to the songs on the album, Sir Nose, who is determined not to dance, is ultimately defeated by Starchild, who is equipped with his Bop Gun, when Starchild shines a Flash Light on him.

Loyd was also responsible for the artwork on Bootsy's Rubber Band's This Boot Is Made for Fonk-N and Parliament's Gloryhallastoopid (Or Pin the Tail on the Funky), both released in 1979.

Loyd was recognized by Billboard for ""Best Use of Computer Graphics"" for his 1982 video for George Clinton's ""Atomic Dog.""

Loyd was the featured caricaturist on the American television game show Win, Lose or Draw.

In November 2006, Loyd was the guest art director for two episodes of the animated television series Class of 3000 on Cartoon Network.

Loyd is African-American.

Living people"," Overton Loyd (born November 24, 1998) is an American football linebacker for the Washington Redskins of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at West Virginia. Loyd was born in Orlando, Florida and attended Dr. Phillips High School, where he was a three-year letterman in both football and track & field. He played safety his first two years, but moved to linebacker his senior year. As a senior, he had 128 tackles, four sacks, three fumble recoveries, three passes defensed, and a defensive touchdown. He was named the Orlando Sentinel's High School Athlete of the Week after recording 20 tackles and a sack in a game. Loyd committed to West Virginia University in July 2015, choosing the Mountaineers over offers from Colorado State, Florida Atlantic, Florida International, and Western Kentucky. As a true freshman in 2016, Loyd played in all 13 games as a reserve linebacker and on special teams. He had 12 tackles, two tackles for loss, a sack, and a pass defensed. As a sophomore in 2017, he started all 13 games at linebacker. He finished the season with 87 tackles, 5.5 tackles for loss, two sacks, five passes defensed, a forced fumble, and a defensive touchdown. After the season, he was named a third-team All-Big 12 selection by the league's coaches and was an honorable mention by the media. In 2018, Loyd started all 12 games he played in and led the Mountaineers with 93 tackles. He also had 5.5 tackles for loss, two sacks, five passes defensed, and a forced fumble. He was named a third-team All-Big 12 selection by the league's coaches and was an honorable mention by the media for the second consecutive year. After the season, he declared for the NFL Draft and was projected as a seventh-round pick. Loyd was drafted by the Washington Redskins in the seventh round, 251st overall, in the 2019 NFL Draft. He was the second linebacker drafted by the Redskins in the 2019 draft, following the selection of Cole Holcomb in the fifth round. He signed his four-year rookie contract on May 13, 2019. He was placed on injured reserve on August 31, 2019, after suffering an injury in the preseason. He was designated for return from injured reserve on January 6, 2020, and began practicing with the team again. He was added to the active roster on January 24, 2020. He appeared in one game for the Redskins in 2019, and recorded two tackles. In Week 17 of the 2020 season, Loyd recorded his first career sack on Dallas Cowboys quarterback Ben DiNucci. Loyd was given an exclusive-rights free agent tender by the Redskins after the 2020 season. He signed the one-year contract on August 2, 2021.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,6122676,0.05452775073028238,0.24210526315789474,0.1534184639824036,0.45950155763239875,4,6,1,0,6,1,1,0,0,1,0.09406242973693854,0.016246966128527624,0.0022093344380005524,0.018427518427518427,8,1,3,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,1,13,1,1,1
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""ITF World Champions"", the article should at least have 250 words","The International Tennis Federation (ITF) designates a World Champion each year based on performances throughout the year, emphasising the Grand Slam tournaments, and also considering team events such as the Davis Cup and Fed Cup. Men's and women's singles champions were first named in 1978; the title is now also awarded for doubles, wheelchair, and junior players. It is sometimes named the ""ITF Player of the Year"" award, alluding to similar other year-end awards in tennis.

Rules and procedures
The ITF's constitution states that no tennis tournament can be designated the ""World Championships"" without unanimous consent of the ITF Council. There is currently no such tournament. The constitution also states:
The ITF may award the title of World Champion to players who, in the opinion of the Board of Directors, are the most outstanding players in any one-year. The names of players who have been awarded this title shall be listed in the Roll of Honour.
It also states:
Official Tennis Championships [i.e. the Grand Slam events] shall be the decisive factor in the determination of the ITF World Champions for each year.

For singles, ITF appoints a panel of former top players at the start of the season, which votes on the champion at the end of the season.

The boys' and girls' singles and doubles titles prior to 2003 were awarded based on world ranking. Since then singles and doubles rankings have been combined in a single award each for boys and for girls.

The world champion accolade has been extended by the ITF to wheelchair tennis players of the Men's and Women's division since 1991. In November 2017, the ITF announced that the quad wheelchair tennis division is to be recognised in its annual list of ITF World Champions.

In 1996, the Philippe Chatrier Award was introduced, honouring individuals or organisations who have made outstanding contributions to tennis globally, both on and off the court. The award is considered to be the ITF's highest accolade and is named after the former French tennis player Philippe Chatrier, who was President of the governing body between 1977 and 1991.

The ITF World Champions' Dinner takes place in Paris during the French Open, to honour the previous year's champions, who are presented with a trophy, but not any monetary prize.

For 2020 there were no ITF World Champion awards given due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The tennis season was suspended for about 5 months for both the female and the male tennis players.

Men's singles
The first men's panel in 1978 had three members, Don Budge, Fred Perry, and Lew Hoad, who attended the season's Grand Slam events at ITF expense to inform their choice. The 1983 panel split two to one between John McEnroe (votes of Budge and Perry) and Mats Wilander (vote of Hoad). The 1984 panel had five members, while the 1985 panel had four: Budge, Perry, Hoad, and Tony Trabert. When Ivan Lendl was chosen as champion for 1985, the panel's announcement was accompanied with a rebuke for Lendl's criticism of some tournaments and his refusal to play in the Davis Cup. Perry and Trabert were on the 1986 panel, with performances outside the Grand Slams taken into consideration.

The 1990 designation of Lendl as champion was a surprise.  That year, the Association of Tennis Professionals named Stefan Edberg its ""Player of The Year"", in accordance with the ATP Rankings, while Tennis Magazine (France) ranked Edberg first, Andre Agassi second, and Lendl third. Tennis also suggested the ITF was punishing Edberg for denigrating the Grand Slam Cup tournament it had introduced. The ITF panel, of Perry, Trabert, and Frank Sedgman, called it ""the toughest decision any of us can remember having to make"", and stated it was Lendl's better average performance in the Grand Slams that made the difference.

The choice to award Djokovic the ITF World Champion of 2013 over Nadal was unexpected. Nadal finished the year ranked #1 and with more slams (2 to 1), more Masters titles (5 to 3), and more tournament titles (10 to 7).  Similar to the situation with Edberg in 1990, the ITF cited Nadal's failure to win a match at 2 of the 4 slams (DNP the Australian Open, 1st round loss at Wimbledon) to justify their decision and Djokovic's consistent results across all four Slams (1 title, 2 runner-ups, 1 SF), Davis Cup (led Serbia to final, won 7/7 singles rubbers) and the ATP World Tour Finals (won title).

Other instances when the ITF choices differed from the ATP rankings are 1978 (Jimmy Connors), 1982 (McEnroe), 1989 (Lendl).   None of these, however, were controversial and were generally agreed upon, with the 1978 and 1982 choices being particularly clear cut in favor of Borg (1978) and Connors (1982).

Women's singles
The women's panel initially featured three former women's champions, Margaret Court, Margaret duPont and Ann Jones. Althea Gibson was a member through the early 1980s.

ITF world champions for women differed from the WTA year-end rankings the following years: 1978 (Martina Navratilova), 1994 (Steffi Graf), 2001 (Lindsay Davenport), 2004 (Lindsay Davenport), 2005 (Lindsay Davenport), 2011 (Caroline Wozniacki), 2012 (Victoria Azarenka), 2017 (Simona Halep).

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Christian Gauss"", the article should at least have 250 words","Christian Gauss (1878 – 1951) was a literary critic and professor of literature.

Biography
Gauss was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan. His father had fled Württemberg when Prussia began to dominate it in the 1860s. The son graduated from the University of Michigan at 20, worked as a newspaper correspondent in Paris, covering the Dreyfus case during which time he met Oscar Wilde  who dedicated one of his poems to Gauss.

Later Gauss taught at Michigan and Lehigh University in the United States, and in 1905 became a first preceptor at Princeton University, where he remained until his retirement in 1946.

At Princeton, Gauss became a full professor two years after his arrival; he was chairman of the department of modern languages; and he served as dean. After retiring from Princeton, he was president of Phi Beta Kappa. The academic society awards a Christian Gauss Award.

Though he was not a prolific author or a public figure, Gauss left a mark on literary scholarship: Princeton University's semiannual series of Christian Gauss Seminars in Criticism (founded in 1949 by R.P. Blackmur), and Phi Beta Kappa's annual Christian Gauss Award (est. 1950) for a book of literary criticism are named in his honor. Gauss influenced and corresponded frequently with F. Scott Fitzgerald and Edmund Wilson.

People from Ann Arbor, Michigan"," Christian Gauss (15 March 1818 – 5 May 1895) was a German classical scholar and Philhellene. Gauss was born in Berlin, the son of the mathematician and physicist Carl Friedrich Gauss and his second wife, Johanna, née Osthoff. He was educated at the universities of Berlin and Göttingen, where he was a student of the classical philologist and archaeologist August Boeckh. In 1843 he published his first work, an essay on the religious and political influence of the Cyropaedia of Xenophon. In 1846 he won the first competition for the new Chair of Classical Philology at the University of Berlin, a position he was to hold for the next forty years. In 1858 he became a full member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences. Although Gauss published on a wide range of classical subjects, he is best known for his work on the history of Greek literature. In this field he published an authoritative history of ancient Greek poetry (etymologisch-historische Untersuchungen über die griechische Dichtung, 1873) and an important study of the career of the Greek tragic poet Aeschylus (Aeschylos, 1877). He also made significant contributions to the understanding of the Greek poetic tradition as it is transmitted in the works of Plato and Aristotle. In particular, he was the first to appreciate the importance of the oral tradition for the study of Greek poetry. His views were summed up in an article, ""Ueber die griechische Dichtung"" (On Greek Poetry, 1868), which has been described as a ""masterpiece of literary history"". Gauss was a dedicatee of the Scholia in Homeri Iliadem (1893) of the Danish scholar overlooked by many, because he wrote in German and never held a position of great authority, but his contributions to the study of Greek poetry, though sometimes unorthodox, were solid and enduring.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,4052666,0.039381153305203934,0.09473684210526316,0.10852234283528964,0.21806853582554517,2,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0.1574751970288312,0.031692845928124394,0.0022093344380005524,0.01597051597051597,4,0,2,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,5,1,9,1,1,1

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Village Mall (Danville, Illinois)"", the article should at least have 250 words","Village Mall is an enclosed shopping mall in Danville, Illinois in the United States. Opened in 1975, the mall's anchor stores are County Market, Pet Supplies Plus, Dunham's Sports, Ross Dress for Less, Citi Trends, Jo-Ann Fabrics, Burlington, Shoe Sensation, Slumberland Furniture, and AMC Theatres. There are 2 vacant anchor store that were once Carson's and Sears. It is managed by T Danville, a division of Tabani Group.

History
Village Mall was developed in the 1970s by SES Development Company. The first store to open was an Ayr-Way discount store in 1972, which later became Target. It was followed by  a National Supermarkets and a Meis department store, which was later sold to Elder-Beerman. The mall itself opened in 1975. J. C. Penney was added in 1985. Sears, which previously had a store in downtown Danville, was offered an incentive by the city to move to the mall in the early 1990s.

Target closed in 1997 due to low sales, and by 1999 had become a Hobby Lobby. J. C. Penney closed its Danville store in 2001 along with two others in Illinois. In 2004, a wing of the mall was renovated to make room for a Goody's clothing store. The former J. C. Penney store became Steve & Barry's in 2006. That same year, several anchors were proposed for the mall, including Old Navy and Dunham's Sports. County Market, which replaced National Supermarket, was also expanded.

Hobby Lobby, Steve & Barry's, and Goody's all closed in 2008, the latter two due to bankruptcy of the chains. The loss of these stores led to rumors that the mall would close or be converted to other uses, or that Elder-Beerman or Sears would relocate to elsewhere in town.

Despite these closures, Pet Supplies Plus opened in part of the former Hobby Lobby. By 2010, the last restaurant had closed in the food court. Elder-Beerman was re-branded Carson's in 2011, and Dunham's Sports filled the rest of the former Hobby Lobby. The former Goody's space became Ross Dress for Less in mid-2012. In mid-2013, Burlington Coat Factory opened in the former J. C. Penney/Steve & Barry's space. The addition of new stores brought occupancy levels up to 78 percent. In September 2014, Sears announced that it would close the Village Mall store. In mid-2015, a Jo-Ann Fabrics was added to the mall, while the city of Danville offered an incentive to the Slumberland Furniture chain to open a store in part of the former Sears.

On January 31, 2018, The Bon-Ton Stores announced that Carson's would be closing as part of a plan to close 42 stores nationwide. The store closed in April 2018. On April 18, 2018, it was announced that The Bon-Ton Stores would be going out of business due to bankruptcy.

Shopping malls established in 1975
Buildings and structures in Danville, Illinois"," Village Mall is a shopping mall in Danville, Illinois. It is anchored by JCPenney, Kmart, and Sears.

In 2009, the mall's owners, Commercial Property Developers, sought to have the mall excluded from the TIF district, claiming that they had already paid more than their fair share of taxes and that the city and school district had both failed to spend the money as promised.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,40842701,0.12939521800281295,0.08421052631578947,0.21866266584296767,0.08878504672897196,0,5,0,0,5,1,0,0,0,1,0.2057325590466979,0.040947710842585944,0.002347417840375587,0.019656019656019656,5,0,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,1,9,1,1,0
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story (soundtrack)"", the article should at least have 250 words","M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story is the soundtrack album to the 2016 Hindi-language film of the same name directed by Neeraj Pandey. Based on the life of former Indian cricketer MS Dhoni, the film stars Sushant Singh Rajput as Dhoni along with Disha Patani, Kiara Advani, and Anupam Kher in pivotal roles. The album consists of nine songs composed by Amaal Mallik in his first album as a solo composer, with one song being composed by Rochak Kohli as a guest composer, featuring lyrics written by Manoj Muntashir. The vocals were performed by Armaan Malik, Arijit Singh, Siddharth Basrur, Rochak Kohli, Palak Muchhal, Ananya Nanda and Adithyan A. Prithviraj. The background music was composed by Sanjoy Chowdhury.

The album was recorded entirely using live instrumentation and has only one soundscape used considering the theme of the film. After M. M. Kreem, whom collaborated with Pandey for the soundtracks: Special 26 and Baby, refused his offer on his priorities with Baahubali: The Beginning (the first film in Rajamouli's Baahubali franchise) despite composing one promotional single, Pandey chose Amaal Malik for the film soundtrack and initially recorded six songs within March—October 2015. No lip-syncing is used in the songs, as the team believed that the songs blend in the narrative. The album released in Tamil, Telugu and Marathi with the lyrics were penned by Pa. Vijay, Chaitanya Prasad and Guru Thakur for the respective languages. Out of the seven songs, a promotional track ""Har Gully Mein Dhoni Hai"" (also released in Tamil) and two alternate versions of the songs were used in Hindi version, while the Telugu and Marathi album have seven tracks.

The album opened to positive reviews from critics, praising Amaal Malik for using single soundscape and retaining the freshness and melody in the tracks, but criticised for the familiarity of the tunes. The tracks ""Besabriyaan"", ""Kaun Tujhe"", ""Phir Kabhi"" and ""Har Gully Mein Dhoni Hai"" received the most consumer response and Palak Muchhal, the singer of ""Kaun Tujhe"" received a News18 and Screen Award for Best Female Playback Singer respectively.

Production 
Initially Neeraj Pandey planned to rope in M. M. Kreem as the composer for the film's soundtrack, after whom the director worked with him in Special 26 (2013) and Baby (2015). Kreem also composed the promotional track ""Phir Se"" written by Manoj Muntashir and recorded by Divya Kumar, for the 2015 Cricket World Cup and dedicated the song to the Indian cricket team. Pandey being a cricket buff said that the idea was ""to sum up the mood and emotion for the entire nation"" and called the song as a ""tribute to the inherent passion our players have for the country and the love we have towards our own team"". Both the director and the composer worked on the song and video in short span of time so as to release the track before the tournament which begins on 14 February 2015. The song received overwhelmingly positive response and Pandey eventually planned to rope Kreem as the composer. But, Kreem's commitments on Baahubali franchise led Pandey to choose a different composer for the songs. When Pandey listened to the song ""Sooraj Dooba Hain"" from the film Roy (2015), Pandey eventually approached the composer of the song, Amaal Malik to work for the biopic's songs along with Bhushan Kumar, the chairman and managing director of T-Series. Malik had eventually composed two single songs for the label —  ""Chal Wahan Jaate Hain"" and ""Zindagi Aa Raha Hoon Main"" — both of them featured Tiger Shroff as the lead.

Amaal Malik composed 25 songs in his film career when he was being a part of multi-composer soundtracks for films, but this was his first album as a solo composer. Initially, the team had planned for a multi-composer setup for the songs in the film, but as Amaal Malik composed the first track ""Besabriyaan"", the team decided to retain him as the composer for the soundtrack. Within October 2015, Malik finished composing six tracks for the film's soundtrack with three of them being romantic numbers which highlighted Dhoni's relationship with his wife Sakshi Dhoni, from the time they first meet to post marriage. Bhushan made Malik sit for nights explaining him the feel and requirement of each song in the film. The album does not have the characters lip-syncing to the songs but will play in the background as they wanted the score to complement the cricketer's image and the album was further recorded with live instruments.

Malik said that the seven songs have ""fine blend of rock and orchestral elements"". He explained that ""The album maintains a balance between commercial and the inspirational aspect, even if one has not seen the movie, they would still be able to relate to the songs, which is why the songs work as stand-alone tracks""; also adding that the album maintains a single sort of soundscape, which he called as the ""most difficult to crack"", calling the film as ""one of his toughest projects in his career"".

Album information 
The track ""Besabriyaan"" which was the first to be composed which is about Dhoni's early life that how he juggled between studies and cricket simultaneously. The second song ""Kaun Tujhe"" is about the relationship with his late girlfriend Priyanka Jha, who died in a tragic accident in 2002. The third song from the film entitled ""Jab Tak"" is about Dhoni's first meeting with his wife Sakshi in the film. Rochak Kohli was announced as the guest composer for the film's soundtrack and composed a promotional single titled ""Har Gully Mein Dhoni Hai"" which is about the craze of cricket in India and public opinion about the sport. It was initially started as the theme of street cricket in India, but Kohli described the song as ""a tribute to dreams and the fight to achieve the dreams"". He further described the song as ""a metaphor for everyone in India who has the potential to rise above their immediate realities to achieve them"" and as ""an emotional song that connects to everyone, in every by-lane of the country, with the hope and passion to succeed"". This song was released in Tamil as ""Ulagam Engum Dhoni Ye"" sung by S. P. Charan and lyrics written by Pa. Vijay. However, it was not featured in the Telugu and Marathi versions of the soundtracks. The promotional song ""Phir Se"" which was made by M. M. Kreem for the 2015 Cricket World Cup was not included in the film.

Reception 
Writing for The Times of India, Rinky Kumar gave the soundtrack album a rating 3 out of 5 adding: ""the album has a mixed bag of tracks, some of which make quite an impression and while others are nothing to write home about"". Surabhi Redkar of Koimoi also rated 3 out of 5, calling the album as ""quite decent"" and praised Amaal Malik for a ""great effort in his first solo album"". Writing for India Today, Devarsi Ghosh added that: ""the album has a few stock market-friendly hit-gaana type numbers, every once in a while, Amaal tries to move away from monotony and do something interesting"". Critic based at Daily News and Analysis praised Amaal Malik for the use of live instruments in the film's soundtrack, calling it as ""a more full-blooded feel"", and further added that ""the album has a couple of snags, but that could not stop the album's winning inning"".

Joginder Tuteja of Bollywood Hungama rated the album 4.5 out of 5 saying ""The music of M.S. Dhoni is good and there is nothing unlikeable about it. Though one doesn't expect the music to become chartbuster from a long term musical experience, in the context of the film most of them should fit in well."" Devesh Sharma of Filmfare gave a 4 out of 5 rating to the soundtrack saying ""Amaal Mallik makes his mark as a solo music director"". A critic from India.com said that ""there is some not-so-wow kind of songs too, but the album will still be liked – thanks to the soft romantic tracks"". Manish Gaekwad of Scroll.in called that ""Mallik has a hit strike rate with the mushy numbers, but he has his work cut out for him if he wants to diversify into other styles"". Critic Gaurang Chauhan of BollywoodLife.com said that the album has ""quite a few hummable tunes to it"" and called the album as a ""must listen for all the romantic hearts"". A critic from Behindwoods gave the album 3 out of 5 calling it as ""an impressive album which stays perfectly true to the film's genre"". Vipin Nair of Music Aloud criticised the soundtrack saying it as ""the album is largely marred by the familiarity in its tunes"", with a rating of 2.5 out of 5. Megha Mathur of The Quint opined that ""Amaal Mallik's compositions are not as dynamic or disruptive as the film's protagonist, despite few long lasting melodies"". She further called that ""The OST falls short of making the biopic a spectacular experience"".

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Escape from Scorpion Island (series 1)"", the article should at least have 250 words","Escape from Scorpion Island is a Bafta nominated BBC children's TV adventure game show in which contestants compete to 'escape from an exotic island'. Series 1 was produced by RDF Television. The first premiered on 3 September 2007 on BBC One and was presented by Caroline Flack and Reggie Yates. It was filmed in Fernando de Noronha, Brazil.

Synopsis
The adventurers arrive on Scorpion Island and are divided into teams, known as Sting and Claw. Each team consists of five members each for a total of ten adventurers. Over the following three weeks the teams are required to complete various challenges in order to gain various advantages throughout the game, such as extra time.

The final objective is to be the first team to escape from the island. During the second week the teams collect Powerplayers for headstarts in the final challenge to escape from the island. On the third week contestants have to use their Powerplayers to gain time advantages. In season 1 the scores were Claw on 3 and Sting on 1. The final challenge was Shadow Mountain Highway. Claw got a 2-minute headstart and eventually won, since Sting's Kyran and Oscar received minor injuries while climbing.

Series 1 also aired in Canada in January 2009 and was broadcast on YTV (TV channel).

Challenges
Drop Off - The ten must abseil out of a helicopter as it hovers more than 30 metres above unknown waters and swim to a waiting pontoon.

Para Shoot - Challengers went para sailing whilst trying to shoot balls at floating targets in the water. Kyran vs Haley. Sent Kyran to Claw
Double Trouble - Two people from each team walk on a zip line while trying to connect ends of their team colored flag to the zip line. Claw won this challenge.
Landing on Water - Two people from each team search for glow sticks inside a half sunken plane wreck. Sting won this challenge.
Colourfall - Three people from each team must collect team coloured balls  as they climb against a torrent of white water up a raging waterfall. Claw won this challenge.
Bike Lane - Two people from each team go one at a time trying to bike across an extremely thin lane 20 metres above one of Scorpion Island's deepest gorges. Claw won this challenge.
Stacked - Teams race head to head to build enormous totem poles, one person on a rope staking the pieces of the pole and the others pulling other ropes to move him/her around.
Reverse Bungees - All of both teams are attached to bungees.  Two of each team, are raised up. *Note: This isn't necessarily a challenge, it was the way of swapping two players of each team to the other team. For more, see above (Contestants).
A Bridge Too Far - Two people from each team on at a time attempt to cross a rickety bridge which is missing huge parts and falls down on one side quite often. Sting won this at first, but Claw used their 'take away' powerplay, and took away some of their time and therefore won.
Landslide! - Two people from each team race up a raging mudslide, with mud, steam, smoke and huge boulders in their way.  Crashing into each other each time one person falls. Sting won this at first, but Claw used their 'mystery' powerplay, swapping the two teams' times and therefore won.
Canopy Crawl - One person from each team will race head-to-head crawling across a zip-line. Sting won at first, but Claw used their powerplay 'repeat' and on the second time, Claw won. This was, arguably, inevitable, as Sting's Joe had to win the first time to keep himself in the game: at this point Claw's Ayesha could choose not to deploy Repeat if she won first time. Having hardly tried the first time, Ayesha flew across, trouncing an exhausted Joe.
Highway/Shadow Mountain - To win the teams must traverse the valley below the mountain on wires 20 metres above the forest floor. The teams must climb the 1500 metre mountain tied together while planting their flags as they go, the first team to summit and raise their final flag will escape and win. Claw won this as they had a huge time advantage and Kyran had breathing problems and Oscar hurt himself on the other team. Claw were awarded with a trip to another tropical island where Caroline and Reggie were waiting with smoothies and mobile-phones so they could call their family before they started the long journey home.

Controversy
Bullying Incident
Season 1 of Scorpion Island started with two less contestants than expected. Unconfirmed Reports suggest that this was due to one contestant's attempts to ostracise another from the group. Both contestants left the group before filming commenced, despite the producers attempts to reconcile the situation. To date this is the only known case of a child being blacklisted from any future CBBC productions.

2007 British television seasons"," Escape from Scorpion Island Escape from Scorpion Island is a British reality game show, hosted by Richard O'Brien, in which contestants are ""kidnapped"" to an island called ""Scorpion"" and must "" escape "" to win a cash prize. The show first aired on BBC Three in September 2005, with the first series being won by then-19-year-old Ryan Jackson from Hampshire, who won £100,000. The show returned for a second series in 2007, and was then cancelled. The show was produced by BBC Wales, and was filmed on a deserted island in the Riau Islands of Indonesia. The name ""Scorpion"" came from the fact that the island was populated with many scorpions. The show's format was similar to that of the popular reality show Survivor, except that the contestants were not competing against each other, only against the island. Each week, one or more contestants were ""eliminated"" by the producers, with the exception of the final episode, in which the winner was decided by a vote. The first series was won by Ryan Jackson, with the second series being won by Claire Hardy from Essex. In 2007, it was announced that the show would be revived for a third series, but this never materialised. The show's theme tune was written by Paul Farrer. As of 2 November 2007, the show had been watched by over 250 million viewers in over 50 countries. The show has been compared to the reality game show The Island, which was filmed in the same location, and also to the science fiction drama Lost. Escape from Scorpion Island has been repeated on BBC One, BBC Three, and Dave. Series 1 The first series of the show was won by Ryan Jackson from Hampshire, who won £100,000. Series 2 The second series was won by Claire Hardy from Essex, who won £150,000.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Finland Plot"", the article should at least have 250 words","In Thailand politics, the Finland Plot, Finland Plan, Finland Strategy, Finland Conspiracy or Finland Declaration (, ) are names of a controversial conspiracy theory espoused by Sondhi Limthongkul and supporters affiliated with the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) in 2006 describing a plot allegedly developed by Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra and former left-wing student leaders to overthrow the former Thai monarch, take control of the nation, and establish a communist state.  The plot allegedly originated in Finland.

The allegations damaged the popularity of Thaksin and his government, despite the fact that no evidence was ever produced to verify the existence of a plot. Thaksin and his Thai Rak Thai (TRT) party vehemently denied the accusations and sued the accusers.  The leaders of the 2006 military coup claimed Thaksin's alleged disloyalty as one of their rationales for seizing power.

Background 
Protests against Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra increased throughout 2005 and 2006 due to a variety of factors, including his April 2005 appearance at a merit-making ceremony at the Temple of the Emerald Buddha, the September 2005 cancellation of Sondhi Limthongkul's Muangthai Raisabdah television show, Thaksin's November 2005 plan to give local communities control of public schools, Thaksin's sale of Shin Corporation in January 2006, and Thaksin's alleged role in the March 2006 destruction of the Phra Phrom Erawan shrine.

Finland Plot 

In May 2006, on the eve of King Bhumibol Adulyadej's 60th anniversary celebrations, the Sondhi Limthongkul-owned Manager Daily newspaper published the details of what it called the ""Finland Plan,"" ""Finland Declaration,"" or ""Finland Strategy.""  The articles claimed that Thaksin and former student leaders of Thailand's 1970s democratic movement met in Finland in 1999 to develop a plan to institute rule by a single party, overthrow the monarchy and establish a republic, and hold elections for provincial governors.  The 5-part article was titled ""Finland Strategy: Thailand's Revolution Plan?"" was written by Pramote Nakhonthap and appeared on 17, 19, 22, 23 and 24 May 2006. Thaksin's alleged co-conspirators apparently included Thai Rak Thai party members Prommin Lertsuridej (Secretary-General to the Premier), Chaturon Chaisaeng (Deputy Prime Minister), Surapong Suebwonglee (Minister of Information and Communications Technology), Adisorn Piangket (Former Deputy Science Minister), Sutham Saengprathum (Deputy Interior Minister), and Phumtham Wechayachai (Deputy Transport Minister), all of whom had been affiliated with the Communist Party of Thailand following the massacre of 6 October 1976.

The allegations were taken up by several prominent critics, including leaders of the People's Alliance for Democracy, constitution drafter Chai-anan Samudavanija, Senator Sophon Supapong, writer Pramote Nakornthab, and Democrat leader Thaworn Senniam.

None of the accusers provided any evidence to back up their allegations.  Sondhi noted that his source was a Thai Rak Thai worker who had recently ""defected.""

Variations and denials 

Variations of the original theory were also proposed, including the claim that the plot involved overseas groups intent on overthrowing the Chakri dynasty, the claim that media consolidation was a core component of the conspiracy, the claim that the Plan was aimed at maintaining a constitutional monarchy while reducing the powers of the monarch to a mere figurehead, and the claim that a law designed to further decentralize central administrative power to the Thai provinces, and the claim that Thaksin wanted to establish a government based on the model of western democracies.

Another variation claimed that Thaksin's co-conspirators were former members of the Communist Party of Thailand including Deputy Transport Minister Phumtham Wechayachai and had applied a theory of orthodox Marxism to map out the TRT strategy to promote capitalism.  This variation claimed that Thailand during the 1970s was still a semi-feudal society and needed to become a capitalist society as part of the transition to socialism.  The communists then worked with Thaksin to fully develop Thailand's capitalist economic system, destroy all remnants of feudalism, and privatize state-owned assets, while at the same time establishing a single-party dictatorship, all in order to create a socialist dictatorship.

The allegations were roundly denied by Thaksin Shinawatra and the leadership of his Thai Rak Thai party, including Surapong Suebwonglee and Prommin Lertsuridej. 

On 30 May, Thaksin Shinawatra and Thana Benjathikul, a lawyer from the Thai Rak Thai party, sued Sondhi, editor Khunthong Lorserivanich, columnist Pramote Nakhonthap, executive Saowalak Thiranujanyong, and webmaster Panjapat Angkhasuwan for libel.  The lawsuit alleged that the articles were intended to ruin Thai Rak Thai and Thaksin's political future by making the public believe the party was planning to overturn the constitutional monarchy.  Thaksin's lawsuit attracted criticism and claims that Thaksin was trying to censor the media.

Impact of the allegations 
  
The allegations damaged the popularity of Thaksin and his government.  Thaksin was forced to expend a significant amount of time and political capital on damage control, explaining his position and swearing his loyalty to the monarchy.

In an editorial, the influential anti-Thaksin newspaper The Nation noted:

The Nation noted that the actual existence of the Plot was not important—the mere invocation of royalty would be enough to damage the Thai Rak Thai party.  Many commentators noted the similarity between the Finland Plot allegations and the allegations used justify the massacre of students on 6 October 1976, which in the context of the Thailand political crisis, might justify a military coup.  The Thai military eventually successfully executed a coup against the Thaksin government on 19 September 2006.  One of the junta's stated rationales for the coup was that Thaksin had insulted the King.

Historical events in Finland"," Finland Plot During World War II, the Finns were forced to cede parts of Karelia, Salla, and Petsamo to the Soviet Union by the Moscow Peace Treaty, signed on March 13, 1940. The Finns had already lost some Karelia to the Soviet Union in the Winter War of 1939–1940, but the Moscow Peace Treaty was seen as a major national humiliation, and the Finns immediately began to plan a future offensive to restore their losses. After the 1941 German invasion of the Soviet Union, the Finns proposed a military cooperation with Nazi Germany against the Soviet Union, in the hope of being able to regain their lost territories. The Finns presented their plan to the Germans on June 4, 1941. The plan called for a pincer movement against the Soviet Union, with Finnish forces attacking from the east and German forces attacking from the west. The Finns proposed that they would capture and secure the territory they had lost to the Soviets in 1940, and then advance further to the east, to the Kola Peninsula. The Finns also offered to provide the Germans with a secure base for their operations in the Soviet Union, by capturing and holding the port of Murmansk. The Germans were initially very interested in the Finnish proposal, but as the planning process continued, the Germans became more and more reluctant to approve the operation. The main reason for the change of heart was that after the German invasion of the Soviet Union began on June 22, 1941, it soon became clear that the Germans would not be able to reach their main goal, the capture of Moscow. The Germans therefore decided that they did not need any additional fronts to fight the Soviet Union, and they canceled the Finnish operation.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,7042983,0.047654504839910655,0.07368421052631578,0.22154215141179584,0.21339563862928349,3,6,0,1,8,0,0,0,0,0,0.26583207590931535,0.02828649830104559,0.009665838166252416,0.020884520884520884,4,0,11,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,1,17,1,1,1
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Kevin Bramble"", the article should at least have 250 words","Kevin Bramble  (born September 19, 1972) is an American disabled ski racer, freeskier, and monoski designer/builder from the Cape May Court House section of Middle Township, New Jersey, United States.  He competes as a monoskier in the LW 12-1 class and is known as a ""speed specialist,"" preferring to compete in downhill and super G.

Career
Bramble grew up in New Jersey and began skiing recreationally in Pennsylvania's Poconos at age 11. By 1994, he was a serious snowboarder and occasional skier living in the Lake Tahoe area when he became paralyzed in a snowboarding accident. He soon taught himself to monoski and moved to Winter Park, Colorado, where he joined the Winter Park Disabled Ski Team. He returned to the Tahoe area soon after, settling in Truckee, California, but having acquired the racing skills that he needed. He was named to the U.S. Disabled Ski Team in 1998 after winning the super G at that year's U.S. Disabled Alpine Championships.

Since 1998, Bramble has had an on-and-off relationship with the U.S. Ski Team, often competing in World Cup competition but eschewing traditional race training in favor of freeskiing with friends at Squaw Valley, California. His greatest success has come in downhill, beginning with a World Cup win on the Paralympic course at Snowbasin, Utah in 2001. A year later, Bramble was the odds-on favorite to win the downhill gold at the 2002 Winter Paralympics in Salt Lake City, Utah, and he did not disappoint, beating teammate Chris Devlin-Young by just 0.17 seconds. Two years later at the Disabled Alpine Skiing World Championships in Wildschönau, Austria, he again won gold in downhill, defeating Germany's Thomas Mayer by an astonishing 1.44 seconds. Two years later at the 2006 Winter Paralympics in Torino, Italy, the pressure was on Bramble to win his third straight major world downhill championship. Once again Bramble proved his dominance, again knocking teammate Devlin-Young down to the silver-medal position with a wild run that won him the gold by nearly a full second.

Bramble has made a reputation for himself not only as a racer but also as a freeskier. One of the first people to take a monoski into terrain parks, halfpipes, and extreme terrain, Bramble and teammate Monte Meier are featured in Warren Miller's 2006 ski movie Off the Grid.

Monoski manufacturer
After several years skiing in a monoski he had purchased, Bramble decided to design and build his own. After several prototypes resulted in a model he was satisfied with, he began hand-building monoskis for friends and teammates, and Kevin Bramble Goodz (KBG) was born. After operating the business out of his garage in Truckee for several years, Bramble relocated back to his home town of Cape May Court House, New Jersey, in 2004 so his family could help him run the business. Seven out of the 10 current U.S. Disabled Ski Team monoskiers ski in KBG monoskis. Bramble also builds his own unique, three-wheeled wheelchairs and has plans to launch a downhill mountain-bike wheelchair soon.

At the age of nine his mother became a full professor at the University of Kentucky, and the family moved to Lexington, where he  attended University High School, Kavanaugh Preparatory School, and the University of Kentucky before entering the United States Naval Academy. Graduating in 1933, he was commissioned an Ensign and was assigned to the USS Salt Lake City (CA-25), where he remained for five years. Transferring to the Atlantic in 1938, he served aboard the USS Schenck (DD-159), and in June 1940 was assigned to the staff of Commander Destroyers, Atlantic Fleet, at the time of that command's creation. During his tenure he met Sheila Taylor of Halifax, Nova Scotia, whom he married in the summer of 1941 in Bermuda.

In 1942 he was the first executive officer of the destroyer USS Hutchins (DD-476), which proceeded from the Atlantic to the Pacific, taking part in combat in the Aleutians and the South Pacific. He was given command of the USS Wilson (DD-408), seeing combat in the South and Central Pacific areas. During this time he was awarded two Navy Commendation medals with Combat ""V."" Towards the end of the war he was assigned as Director of Naval Officer Procurement, Bureau of Naval Personnel, a position he held from 1944 to 1946.

Following World War II, he served in various capacities such as Executive Assistant to the Chief of Naval Personnel 1953 to 1955, a battleship executive officer, commanding an amphibious ship and a destroyer division, and as operations officer of the U.S. Pacific Fleet. He also served on the Holloway Board whose mission was to ""study the form, system, and method of education of Naval officers."" The outcome of the board was the establishment of modern Naval ROTC and direct commissions for college graduates from Officer Candidate School.

Duncan was promoted to flag rank in the summer of 1958, and concurrently assigned Commander, Amphibious Group One from 1958 to 1959, followed by Commander, Amphibious Training Command, Pacific Fleet from 1959 to 1961.

During this time he was promoted to vice admiral. He was awarded the Legion of Merit for ""exceptionally meritorious service"" while Commander Amphibious Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet, from June 1965 to May 1967.

Duncan became Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Manpower and Naval Reserve) and the Chief of Naval Personnel, serving in that capacity from April 1968 to August 1970, before becoming the seventh NATO Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic on September 30, 1970, and concurrently Commander in Chief Atlantic (the United States Unified Command) and the Commander in Chief of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet. As Supreme Allied Commander, Atlantic, he conducted the largest NATO naval exercises held until that time. He received the Order of Orange-Nassau from the Netherlands, and the Grand Cross of the Order of Aviz from Portugal. He retired from the U.S. Navy on November 1, 1972 as a full admiral.

Post-military career
After retiring, he lived near Leesburg, Virginia until January 1977, continuing to serve as a member of the Secretary of the Navy's Advisory Board on Education and Training, and as a member of the Board of Advisors to the President, U.S. Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island. He eventually moved to Coronado, California.

He became a member of the Board of Trustees of the San Diego Museum of Art in 1981, and in 1984, he was elected as a member of France's Académie de Marine and also was named a Kentucky colonel. He died of cancer on June 27, 1994, at the Scripps Clinic in La Jolla, California.

In 1961, while Drinnon was a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, he was discovered by police to be the next person on the target list of John Harrison Farmer, who felt that he was on a mission from God to kill people who he believed were associated with communism.

While there he taught two popular courses on ""A Critical View of American History"" which emphasized the negatives during American history from 1776 to the present. He ultimately was denied tenure because of his political activism. He protested the execution of Caryl Chessman, was the first faculty advisor for SLATE, the activist student union, and was about to be called up to the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) because they suspected him of being a communist. At the time he was denied tenure he had already published his first book, Rebel in Paradise: A Biography of Emma Goldman.

During the Columbia University protests of 1968, Drinnon participated in a student walkout of a speech at Bucknell University by Vice President Hubert H.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Advice to a Friend on Choosing a Mistress"", the article should at least have 250 words","""Advice to a Friend on Choosing a Mistress"" is a letter by Benjamin Franklin dated June 25, 1745, in which Franklin counsels a young man about channeling sexual urges.  Due to its licentious nature the letter was not published in collections of Franklin's papers in the United States during the 19th century.  Federal court decisions from the mid- to late- 20th century cited the document as a reason for overturning obscenity laws.

Text
Franklin begins by advising a young man that a cure for sexual urges is unknown, and the proper solution is to take a wife.  Then, expressing doubts that the intended reader will actually marry, Franklin names several advantages of marriage.  As supplementary advice in case the recipient rejects all previous arguments, Franklin lists eight reasons why an older mistress is preferable to a young one.  Advantages include better conversation, less risk of unwanted pregnancy, and ""greater prudence in conducting an intrigue.""

According to John Richard Stevens, the unnamed correspondent is a friend of Franklin's named Cadwallader Colden, and it remains unknown whether Franklin was serious or if the letter was ever delivered.  Whether serious or humorous, the letter is frankly sexual:

Censorship
The Mistress letter was not the only document by Franklin that later generations censored.  The bawdy portion of Franklin's writing was accepted during his own era.  Although the Mistress letter was not published during his lifetime, Franklin's public works include an essay called ""Fart Proudly"".  A passage from his Autobiography describes an unsuccessful attempt to seduce a friend's mistress.  As John Semonche observes in Censoring Sex: A Historical Journey Through American Media, the autobiography was widely read during the 19th century because of its moral lessons, but the passage about the failed seduction was variously altered or deleted entirely.  The Mistress letter was omitted from 19th century publications of Franklin's works, and by some accounts it was singled out for suppression.

This censorship occurred both informally and under law.  The first state to enact obscenity legislation was Vermont in 1821.  During the following decades every state except New Mexico adopted similar laws.  Then the Comstock Act of 1873 made it a federal crime to circulate ""obscene, lewd, and/or lascivious"" material through the mail.

Although Franklin had mistresses throughout his life (including one still-unknown mistress who bore his only son William Franklin), such circumstances were incompatible with patriotic sensibilities a century afterward.  Amy Beth Werbel opines bluntly:

Citations
By the mid-20th century, United States federal judges were citing the letter in originalist reasoning to overturn obscenity laws.  A Jerome Frank appellate opinion of 1957 named ""Advice to a Young Man on Choosing a Mistress"" along with ""The Speech of Polly Baker"" as two examples that would have convicted one of the nation's leading founding fathers on federal obscenity charges if they had been written and mailed under subsequent law.

The most notable of these citations occurred in the United States Supreme Court case, United States v. 12 200-ft. Reels of Film.  In a dissenting opinion, Justice William O. Douglas states:

In popular culture
Franklin appears as a character in Assassin's Creed III (2012), a video game set during the American Revolution. At one point, he has a discussion with the main character about the benefits of older women as sexual partners. Franklin's side of the conversation is an edited version of the Mistress letter.

18th-century documents"," Advice to a Friend on Choosing a Mistress PG Wodehouse, in his novel The Inimitable Jeeves, includes an unusual variation on the theme of the procuress. In chapter 7, the novel's narrator, Bertie Wooster, is asked by a friend, George Caffyn, to provide advice on how to choose a mistress. Caffyn is a journalist who writes a column on the subject under the pseudonym ""Junius"". In the course of the story, Wooster asks Jeeves for advice, and Jeeves suggests a number of points that Wooster can make in his advice to Caffyn. The most important of these is that the ideal mistress is a married woman with a dissolute husband. The advice to Caffyn is that he should look for a woman with a ""fat and cheerful"" husband, because such a woman will be neglected and therefore available. The ideal woman is ""young, under thirty if possible, and with a good figure"". It is important that she should ""be a bit gone on you"", but a man can work on that. The most important consideration is that the husband should be ""fat and cheerful"". If he is thin and gloomy the woman will be too anxious and the affair will lack ""zip"". It is also important that the husband should be neglectful: ""A thin and gloomy husband takes his wife's affairs seriously. A fat and cheerful husband laughs at his wife's affairs. The thin and gloomy husband says to himself, 'This is a serious business, a woman is a serious business'. The fat and cheerful husband says to himself, 'This is a joke, a woman is a joke'. And that is why the fat and cheerful husband is to be avoided"". In the end, Caffyn does not follow this advice, and his mistress, to whom he had written a letter, advising her as to how to choose a lover, is revealed to be a friend of the thin and gloomy type.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,18509900,0.080168776371308,0.1368421052631579,0.19795251963639568,0.2538940809968847,3,5,0,0,5,0,0,1,0,1,0.29281027442341007,0.02401075782600754,0.002899751449875725,0.03194103194103194,4,0,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,1,11,1,1,1
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Amigo (film)"", the article should at least have 250 words","Amigo is a 2010 American-Philippine drama film written and directed by John Sayles. The film takes place in the Philippines in 1900 during the Philippine–American War.

Plot
Amigo centers on Rafael Dacanay, kapitan of the fictional barrio of San Isidro in a rice-growing area of Luzon. His brother Simón, head of the local guerrilla band, has forced the surrender of the Spanish guardia civil outpost and charged Rafael with the task of imprisoning the guardia Captain and the barrio’s Spanish friar, Padre Hidalgo, in the name of the First Philippine Republic. But when the American troops chasing General Emilio Aguinaldo arrive, the Spanish officer and Padre Hidalgo are freed, and a garrison under the command of Lieutenant Ike Compton is left to ""protect"" the barrio. The American occupation policy now changes from ""hearts and minds"" to ""concentration"" (what was called ""hamletting"" during the Vietnam war) and Rafael has to answer to both the Americans and the Filipino nationalists, with deadly consequences.

Cast

Development
Cinematical reports that the film was once titled Baryo, and that the idea for it came from a yet-to-be-published novel Some Time in the Sun, detailing U.S. imperialism in the Philippines.
The book will actually be called A Moment in the Sun, though the unrealized screenplay which inspired it was called Some Time in the Sun.

The screenplay was written in two weeks and it was filmed over eight months on the island province of Bohol.

Sayles said the ""amigo"" of the title was the mayor:
The American soldiers were always asked, “Is he a good amigo or a bad amigo?” There was some irony to him being called an amigo. However, the complication in that movie that the usual war movie, you follow the guys on one side and the other side is the enemy. You root for the guys on your side and the other side is shooting at them. This is a movie where it’s almost evenly divided. Forty-eight percent is in English, 48 percent is in Tagalog, and there’s a little Cantonese and Spanish thrown in. So the audience is asked to do something they’re not normally asked in a chronological war movie, which is to spend time with all the combatants and the noncombatants. They, therefore, know more than any, one character does. That affects the structure as well, but there is just a structure of events. But how you feel about those events is different because you get to be on both sides and actually care about people on both sides. In a way, what I hope is that by the end of the movie, you’re hoping that they won’t have a confrontation, but that confrontation is inevitable.

Release
It was screened on September 14 at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival. Then later at the San Sebastián International Film Festival and the Rio de Janeiro International Film Festival.

Amigo had its New York premiere at the 2011 Asian American International Film Festival on August 10.

In the Philippines, the film was released on July 6, 2011 by Star Cinema and Origin8Media.

The film was released in North America on August 19, 2011 by Variance Films.

Reception
The film was met with generally positive reviews. The film received a score of 60% with a certified ""Fresh"" rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 47 reviews.

James Rocchi of MSN Movies said the film ""feels more passionate and provocative than 99% of everything else out there.""

Connie Ogle from the Miami Herald in her review said ""A reflection on power and betrayal, on the thin line between acting as your conscience demands and protecting obligations close to your heart.""

Peter Travers of Rolling Stone awarded the film 3 out of 4 stars wrote ""John Sayles, a filmmaker by trade, a provocateur by nature, means to stir things up with Amigo. That he does, and more power to him.""

Stephen Whitty of the Newark Star-Ledger wrote ""By choosing Rafael as its hero, ""Amigo"" looks not only at a little-known part of American history, but at a rarely examined type of movie character.""

David Fear of Time Out New York wrote in his ""Few filmmakers are ambitious enough these days to try addressing our present world-policing endeavors through the prism of past ones, so it almost seems churlish to take Sayles to task for relying on overly dogmatic storytelling.""

Mark Neumaier of the New York Daily News wrote ""An engrossing, perceptive, supremely humane drama about imperialism and loyalty.""

Films scored by Mason Daring"," Amigo is a 1998 American Western film directed by Simon Wincer and starring Charles Bronson, Jason Robards, and Benrubi. It is based on the story of the killing of a police officer in the New Mexico desert in 1928, a crime for which an innocent man was eventually pardoned. The film was shot in Australia. In 1928, a belligerent Texas Ranger named JR Childs (Bronson) is sent to the small town of Hermosa to investigate the murder of a local sheriff, a friend of his. He is accompanied by a naive young officer named Bobby Download (Benrubi), newly graduated from the Texas Ranger Academy. The pair question the locals, including a shopkeeper named señor Brooks (Robards), who tells them that the only suspect is a man named Pablo, who was seen leaving the sheriff's office just before the shooting. However, the locals also tell the rangers that Pablo has disappeared and is widely thought to be dead. Childs's investigation is interrupted when a local woman, Inez (Bujold), is attacked by a pair of men. Childs shoots one of the men dead, and the other escapes. Later, Childs discovers that the dead man is Pablo, and that the two men were working together. Childs and Download question Inez, but she tells them that she cannot identify the other man. Download is injured in a fall from a cliff during a search of Pablo's body, and is subsequently bedridden. Childs continues the investigation alone, and discovers that Inez is lying about the other man. She tells him that her husband, a local named Diego, is the real killer, but that he has gone to El Paso. She gives Childs a photo of Diego. Childs travels to El Paso and finds Diego, but he denies any knowledge of the murder. Before Childs can arrest him, Diego is shot dead by a local police officer, who claims that Diego was drawing a gun. Childs returns to Hermosa and questions Inez again, but she continues to insist that Diego was not the killer. Childs decides to let her go, but as he reaches to release her, she grabs his gun and shoots herself dead. Download recovers sufficiently to be able to travel back to Texas. He and Childs are accompanied by a local man, who is driving them to the nearest railroad. The man is obviously frightened of Childs, and tries to make conversation. Childs asks him about the local pronunciation of the word ""Amigo"", and then shoots him dead. The film ends with Download and Childs riding away. The film was based on the story of the killing of a police officer in the New Mexico desert in 1928, a crime for which an innocent man was eventually pardoned.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""2020 United States presidential election in Indiana"", the article should at least have 250 words","The 2020 United States presidential election in Indiana was held on Tuesday, November 3, 2020, as part of the 2020 United States presidential election in which all 50 states plus the District of Columbia participated. Indiana voters chose electors to represent them in the Electoral College via a popular vote, pitting the Republican Party's nominee, incumbent President Donald Trump, and running mate Vice President Mike Pence against Democratic Party nominee, former Vice President Joe Biden, and his running mate California Senator Kamala Harris. Indiana has 11 electoral votes in the Electoral College.

Indiana was the home state of Pence, who served as Governor of Indiana from 2013 to 2017. Pence retained a 59% approval among voters in his home state.

On the day of the election, most news organizations considered Indiana a state Trump would win, or a red state. Trump won Indiana by 57% to Biden's 41%, a slight increase in his vote share from 2016, but with a reduction in his margin of victory. This election marked the first time since 1952 and only the third time since 1888 that Vigo County, home to Terre Haute and a significant bellwether county, voted for the losing candidate in a presidential election. Biden subsequently became the first presidential nominee of either party since 1952, and the first Democrat since 1884, to win without carrying Vigo County. Biden also became the first Democrat since 1944 to win without carrying traditionally Democratic Perry County in Southern Indiana. Biden did flip Tippecanoe County, home to Lafayette, from Republican to Democratic. Trump also became the first Republican since 1984 to carry exurban Madison County with more than 60% of the vote. This is also the first election since 1992 in which Indiana voted to the right of Kansas.

Notably, Biden reduced the Republican margin in Hamilton County, a suburban county in the Indianapolis metropolitan area that is the state's fourth-most populous county. Hamilton County has never supported a candidate of the Democratic Party for president except for 1912, when the split in the Republicans allowed Woodrow Wilson to carry the county with a 34.9% plurality. Hamilton broke 60%-38% for John McCain in 2008, when Barack Obama won Indiana. Mitt Romney won Hamilton County 66%-32% in 2012 and Trump won it 56%-37% in 2016, nearly identical to his statewide margin. In this election, Trump narrowly won Hamilton County, 52%-45%, a margin that is to the left of the statewide result. Biden's 45% vote share in Hamilton County is higher than that of even Lyndon B. Johnson in his nationwide landslide in 1964 and higher than that of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936. Biden's vote share in Hamilton is only equaled by Roosevelt's 44.85% share in his 1932 landslide.

2020
Presidential"," The 2020 United States presidential election in Indiana was held on Tuesday, November 3, 2020, as part of the 2020 United States presidential election in which all 50 states participated. Indiana voters chose 11 electors to represent them in the Electoral College via a popular vote, pitting the Republican Party's nominee, incumbent President Donald Trump, against Democratic Party nominee, former Vice President Joe Biden. Indiana was won by Trump, who carried the state with 61.2% of the vote and a margin of victory of 18.2%. Prior to the election, all 14 news organizations projected Indiana as strongly Republican. Trump significantly improved on his 2016 performance in Indiana, improving his vote share by 4.4% and his margin of victory by 4.1%. In 2016, Trump won the state with 56.2% of the vote and a margin of victory of 16.3%. With Trump's victory in the state, he passed William Henry Harrison and became the third Republican to win the state twice, after Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover. Biden carried Indiana's 12 most populated counties, including Marion County, where the state's largest city and capital Indianapolis is located. Indiana was the state with the most electoral votes to be won by Trump, and was the fifth most populous state in the nation. In recent years, Indiana has trended Republican, with the last Democratic presidential nominee to win the state being Barack Obama in 2008. In 2016, Indiana gave Trump 56.2% of the vote, with the state's electoral delegates giving him enough electoral votes to claim the presidency even if he had lost every other state. In the 2020 Republican National Convention, the Republican Party nominated incumbent President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence as the Republican ticket to run for office. The Republican National Convention was held in the state's largest city, Indianapolis. The 2016 Democratic National Convention was held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where the Democratic Party nominated former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Senator Tim Kaine as the Democratic ticket to run for office. Clinton won the national popular vote but lost the electoral college to Trump. The 2020 Democratic National Convention was held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where the Democratic Party nominated former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Kamala Harris as the Democratic ticket to run for office. Biden won the national popular vote as well as the electoral college. The election was held during a period of great unrest in the country, with the COVID-19 pandemic and associated economic crisis having begun in March, the George Floyd protests beginning in May, and the 2020 United States census beginning in April. In the weeks prior to the election, Trump and Biden were nearly tied in the polls, with Trump holding a slight edge. On October 22, 2020, Trump and Biden debated in a tense first presidential debate, with Trump repeatedly interrupting Biden. The debate was held at the Health Education Campus of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. Trump won the election, with 61.2% of the vote and a margin of victory of 18.2%. Biden won the national popular vote, with 51.3% of the vote and a margin of victory of 4.5%. On election night, Trump held a large rally with his supporters in the East Room of the White House to await the results. At around 1:00 a.m. EST on November 4, 2020, Biden was declared the winner of the election, having won the state of Pennsylvania and its 20 electoral votes. Trump did not concede the election, and he and his supporters continued to make unsubstantiated claims of widespread electoral fraud. On December 14, 2020, the United States House of Representatives voted to accept the electoral college votes of Michigan and Arizona, which were contested by Trump. The next day, the United States Senate voted to accept the electoral college votes of Michigan and Arizona. The votes of the two states gave Biden a total of 306 electoral votes, enough to win the presidency.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,59562120,0.029681361850720213,0.2736842105263158,0.08688705686870624,0.778816199376947,3,2,1,0,4,0,1,1,0,1,0.057392699039582225,0.022892593130305543,0.004418668876001105,0.033169533169533166,19,0,7,5,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,11,1,29,1,1,1
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Vladimir II Monomakh"", the article should at least have 250 words","Vladimir II Monomakh (Old East Slavic: Володимѣръ Мономахъ, Volodiměrŭ Monomakhŭ; ; ; Christian name: Vasiliy, Vasyl, or Basileios) (26 May 1053 – 19 May 1125) reigned as Grand Prince of Kievan Rus' from 1113 to 1125. He is considered a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church and is celebrated on May 6.

Family 
He was the son of Vsevolod I (married in 1046) by a relative of Byzantine emperor Constantine IX Monomachos, from whom Vladimir obtained his sobriquet. Contemporary Byzantine naming practice allowed the adoption of a maternal surname if the mother's family was perceived to be of a more exalted origin than that of the father.

Reign 

In his famous Instruction (also known as The Testament) to his own children, Monomakh mentions that he conducted 83 military campaigns and 19 times made peace with the Polovtsi. At first he waged war against the steppe jointly with his cousin Oleg, but after Vladimir was sent by his father to rule Chernigov and Oleg made peace with the Polovtsi to retake that city from him, they parted company. Since that time, Vladimir and Oleg were bitter enemies who would often engage in internecine wars. The enmity continued among their children and more distant posterity.

From 1094, his chief patrimony was the southern town of Pereyaslav, although he also controlled Rostov, Suzdal, and other northern provinces (see Principality of Pereyaslavl). In these lands he founded several towns, notably his namesake, Vladimir, the future capital of Russia. In order to unite the princes of Rus' in their struggle against the Great Steppe, Vladimir initiated three princely congresses, the most important being held at Lyubech in 1097 and Dolobsk in 1103.

In 1107 he defeated Boniak, a Cuman khan who led an invasion on Kievan Rus'. When Sviatopolk II died in 1113, the Kievan populace revolted and summoned Vladimir to the capital. The same year he entered Kiev to the great delight of the crowd and reigned there until his death in 1125. As may be seen from his Instruction, he promulgated a number of reforms in order to allay the social tensions in the capital. These years saw the last flowering of Ancient Rus, which was torn apart 10 years after his death.

Vladimir Monomakh is buried in the Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev. Succeeding generations often referred to his reign as the golden age of that city. Numerous legends are connected with Monomakh's name, including the transfer from Constantinople to Rus of such precious relics as the Theotokos of Vladimir and the Vladimir/Muscovite crown called Monomakh's Cap.

Marriages and children 
Vladimir married three times. Some sources cite his first wife as Gytha of Wessex, daughter of Harold of England who had fallen at Hastings in 1066 and of Edith Swannesha. Problems exist in that none of the sources citing this are contemporary, and none of the Russian sources cite the name of his first wife as the daughter of Harold Godwinson. The ""Testament of Vladimir Monomakh"" records her date of death as 7 May 1107. However does not mention her name, only identifying her as the mother of Yuri..

They had at least six children, possibly more:

 Mstislav I of Kyiv (1 June 1076 – 14 April 1132)
 Izyaslav Vladimirovich, Prince of Kursk (c. 1077 – 6 September 1096)
 Svyatoslav Vladimirovich, Prince of Smolensk and Pereyaslav (c. 1080 – 16 March 1114)
 Yaropolk II of Kyiv (1082 – 18 February 1139)
 Viacheslav I of Kyiv (1083 – 2 February 1154)
 Yuri (George), later known as Yuri Dolgoruki (d. 15 May 1157).

The mother of Yuri is unclear, most historians agree it was more likely Gytha, based upon Yuri's acceptable marriage age in 1108.

The following daughter has been attributed to either the first or the second wife:
 Marina Vladimirovna (d. 1146). Married Leon Diogenes, a pretender to the throne of the Byzantine Empire who claimed to be a son of Romanos IV and who rose to the rank of khan of the Cumans in Ossetia.

Vladimir's second wife, Eufimia, is considered to have been a Byzantine noblewoman.  This marriage produced at least five children:
 Roman, Prince of Volhynia (d. 6 January 1119)
 Eufemia of Kyiv (d. 4 April 1139). Married Coloman of Hungary.
 Agafia (Agatha). Married Vsevolod Davidovich, Prince of Gorodno. According to older historians her husband was a son of David Igorevich, Prince of Volhynia (d. 1113), but this theory was rejected.
 Andrew, Prince of Volhynia (11 July 1102 – 1141).

Vladimir's third marriage is thought to have been to a daughter of Aepa Ocenevich, Khan of the Cumans. Her paternal grandfather was Osen. Her people belonged to the Kipchaks, a confederation of pastoralists and warriors of Turkic origin.

However the Primary Chronicle identifies Aepa as father-in-law to Yuri Dolgoruki, with Vladimir negotiating the marriage in name of his son. Whether father and son married sisters or the identity of intended groom was misidentified remains unclear.

His father was the eldest son of Olga of Kiev by her second husband, Prince Boris. Vladimir II Monomakh succeeded his father as the ruler of Kievan Rus' in 1113. During his reign, Kievan Rus' was in a state of decline due to constant warfare with the Cumans, the Pechenegs, and the Polovtsy. The state was also threatened by the rise of the Mongols in the East. Despite this, Vladimir II was able to maintain the unity of Kievan Rus' and to keep the capital safe from the invaders. In 1114, Vladimir II concluded an alliance with the Cumans. The following year, the Polovtsy attacked Kievan Rus', but were repelled. In 1116, the Pechenegs invaded from the south, but Vladimir II defeated them and made a peace treaty with them. In 1119, the Cumans, under their Khan, attacked Kievan Rus'. Vladimir II was forced to conclude a treaty with the Cumans, in which he agreed to pay tribute to the Khan. In 1124, the Cumans invaded again, but were defeated by Vladimir II and his allies, the Polovtsy.

The power station comprises two 25 MW units and two 17.5 MW units, and has a total generating capacity of 70 MW. The Ace Horana Power Station was commissioned in March 2013, and was officially declared open by the then-president of Sri Lanka, Mahinda Rajapakse, on 27 November 2013. The power station was built at a cost of US$ 80 million, and is the second power station in Sri Lanka to be fuelled by coal, after the 300 MW Kelanitissa Power Station. The Ace Horana Power Station is connected to the national grid via a dedicated 50 kV transmission line, which runs for approximately 10 km from the power station to the Horana Substation. The power station is designed to operate on a maximum continuous rating (MCR) basis, and can supply up to 70 MW of electricity to the national grid during peak demand periods.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Corruption in local government"", the article should at least have 250 words","Because there are many factors that can lead to corruption in local government, it is hard to study corruption patterns empirically, but recently, improved research strategies and information sources have made such studies better.

Types
There are several types of political corruption that occur in local government. Some are more common than others, and some are more prevalent to local governments than to larger segments of government. Local governments may be more susceptible to corruption because interactions between private individuals and officials happen at greater levels of intimacy and with more frequency at more decentralized levels. Forms of corruption pertaining to money like bribery, extortion, embezzlement, and graft are found in local government systems. Other forms of political corruption are nepotism and patronage systems. One historical example was the Black Horse Cavalry a group of New York state legislators accused of blackmailing corporations.
 
 Bribery is the offering of something which is most often money but can also be goods or services in order to gain an unfair advantage. Common advantages can be to sway a person's opinion, action, or decision, reduce amounts fees collected, speed up a government grants, or change outcomes of legal processes. 
 Extortion is threatening or inflicting harm to a person, their reputation, or their property in order to unjustly obtain money, actions, services, or other goods from that person. Blackmail is a form of extortion.
 Embezzlement is the illegal taking or appropriation of money or property that has been entrusted to a person but is actually owned by another. In political terms this is called graft which is when a political office holder unlawfully uses public funds for personal purposes.
 Nepotism is the practice or inclination to favor a group or person who is a relative when giving promotions, jobs, raises, and other benefits to employees. This is often based on the concept of familism which is believing that a person must always respect and favor family in all situations including those pertaining to politics and business. This leads some political officials to give privileges and positions of authority to relatives based on relationships and regardless of their actual abilities.
 Patronage systems consist of the granting favors, contracts, or appointments to positions by a local public office holder or candidate for a political office in return for political support. Many times patronage is used to gain support and votes in elections or in passing legislation. Patronage systems disregard the formal rules of a local government and use personal instead of formalized channels to gain an advantage.

Demographic factors

Socioeconomic characteristics and the size of the population of people that make up a municipality can be encouraging factors for local government officials to engage in corrupt practices. Patterns of political corruption can be found in places that have a similar demographic make-up. Demographic factors that have been known to lead to or increase the likelihood of corruption in a local government system are religion, race, class, size of the municipality, local economic conditions, education, political culture, and gender. Some factors are interrelated or can lead to other factors which may cause more corruption.

Size of a municipality
Smaller municipalities may be more prone to experience corruption within their local government. These towns and villages nominate (or self-nominate) residents or officials to represent and run the local government, sometimes without oversight approval from higher levels of government. In a small community, personal opinions and relationships play a larger role in politics. Due to this, problems like nepotism or extortion can be prevalent. In addition, some local governments face another kind of disadvantage - lack of experience and professionalism from their representatives. It can be a challenge to attract qualified up and coming politicians to small towns. Another major issue in small municipalities lies with accountability - some have inadequate or insufficient structures for policing and prosecution of corrupt local officials, culminating in a difficult situation for those affected.

Condition of the local economy
Low economic development has been found to be an encouraging factor for political corruption. Economic practices like dependence on raw material industries and drug trades are characteristic of poorer cities and areas with increased amounts of corruption. Economic dependence on certain industries will also lead to less stable governments and less money available to fund governments. Fragile economies lead to increased levels of poverty and less opportunities to get out of poverty. Poverty is a known factor that encourages corruption in local governments. Places with failing economies and poverty sometimes get loans or start aid programs to support the local economy and the people, and public officials are often able to unlawfully take the money or goods for private gain. With less money available, local officials are more likely to get lower wages, which is seen as another factor that leads to corruption. Officials who get lower wages, which are not enough to provide for their necessities, will many times become corrupt and try something like embezzling money that may entrusted to them in the local treasury. Low wages can cause economic insecurity and encourage politicians to take advantage of current opportunities as public figures of authority. On the other hand, some researchers argue that the more money a local government has to spend, the more tendency it will have to do so inefficiently, which can lead to suspicions of corruption. Overall, poorer municipalities are more often perceived to have corrupt local governments than rich ones.

Education
Lower levels of education which are often caused by poverty are seen as a factor which encourages corrupt government practices. Those with less education are not as informed as to how the government works or what rights they have under the government. It is easier for corrupt office-holders to conceal corrupt activities from a poorly educated public. Uneducated citizens are less likely to be aware of corruption in local governments or how to stop it, and therefore, corruption is able to remain and spread. Without some kind of political awareness, citizens will not know which candidates to elect that are honest or dishonest or other ways to prevent corruption from taking place in their local governments. This often leads municipalities to be continually governed by one or more corrupt local officials who use patronage or nepotistic practices to stay in office or keep influence in the government for long periods of time. When local political leaders are less educated, they will be less likely to find legitimate ways to make the municipality well-structured, productive, and successful.

Political culture of municipality
Many local governments have an established political culture with certain expectations and practices that often determine what is seen as acceptable and not acceptable in local politics. In municipalities with an undeveloped or underdeveloped political culture, accountability and legitimacy is usually low and principles of ethics in government are not established. This can encourage corruption to take hold in the local government because citizens do not know what is considered corrupt, and local officials are not afraid to be corrupt because of the low accountability.In some places the local governments have been corrupt for so long that the citizens think that is how it is supposed to work because that is all they have been exposed to. Long periods of political instability will also lead to corruption in the government because people are unsure of how the government should operate, and thus do not know what practices are corrupt or how to stop them if they are corrupt.

Political corruption
Local government"," Corruption in local government The abuse of local government offices for personal gain is a form of corruption. Corruption can take many forms in local government. The most common is the corruption of the electoral process. In one form of this, a candidate or party pays for votes, whether through straight cash payments, or by providing other inducements such as food, alcohol, or gifts. Another form of electoral corruption is the theft or destruction of electoral materials, which can be used to influence the election outcome. A second area where corruption can occur is the misappropriation of funds. This can take a number of forms, such as the diversion of funds to other projects not approved by the local government, or the use of funds for personal gain. A third area where corruption can occur is the abuse of power. This can take the form of a local government official using their position to benefit themselves or their friends and family. It can also take the form of a local government official using their position to harm others, such as by stealing their property or intimidating them. Corruption in local government can have a number of negative consequences. It can undermine the credibility and legitimacy of the local government, and can make people lose trust in their elected officials. It can also lead to inefficient use of resources, as funds may be diverted to projects that are not priority for the local government. A number of strategies have been proposed to address corruption in local government. These include increasing transparency and accountability in the local government, such as by requiring the local government to publish its budget and spending information online. It is also important to ensure that local government officials are properly trained and supervised, to reduce the opportunities for corruption. In the United States, local government corruption is typically handled by state authorities. In many states, the state attorney general has the authority to investigate and prosecute corruption cases involving local government. In other countries, local government corruption may be handled by the national government. In some cases, a special anti-corruption body may be created to address corruption in local government. In some countries, a combination of national and local efforts may be used to address corruption in local government. For example, in India, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is a federal agency that can investigate and prosecute cases of local government corruption. Corruption in local government is a widespread problem, and can have serious consequences for the credibility and effectiveness of local government. It is important to address this problem through a combination of national and local efforts, in order to ensure that local government is accountable and transparent.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,3350312,0.162748643761302,0.22105263157894736,0.38878172396838007,0.45950155763239875,1,4,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0.1830555902369259,0.020024563257514404,0.0040044186688760015,0.022113022113022112,6,1,9,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,7,0,1,1

Dylan Thomas
In spring 1936, the poet Dylan Thomas met Caitlin Macnamara (1913–1994), a 22-year-old blonde-haired, blue-eyed dancer of Irish descent. She had run away from home, intent on making a career in dance, and aged 18 joined the chorus line at the London Palladium. Introduced by the artist Augustus John, Caitlin's lover, they met in The Wheatsheaf. Laying his head in her lap, a drunken Thomas proposed. Thomas liked to comment that he and Caitlin were in bed together ten minutes after they first met. Although Caitlin initially continued her relationship with John, she and Thomas began a correspondence, and in the second half of 1936 were courting. They married at the register office in Penzance, Cornwall, on 11 July 1937.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Andriza Mircovich"", the article should at least have 250 words","Andriza (or Andrew) Mircovich (,  1879 – May 14, 1913) was an Austro-Hungarian national of Serb descent. He was the only prisoner ever to be executed by shooting in the US state of Nevada. He had been sentenced to death for the premeditated murder of John Gregovich in Tonopah, Nevada. Mircovich felt that he was owed more money from Gregovich's administration of his late cousin's estate and resorted to settling the matter by stabbing Gregovich to death.

A 1911 statute was passed by the Nevada Legislature that allowed a death row inmate to opt to die by shooting or hanging; that statute was repealed in 1921. Mircovich was insistent on shooting, claiming that hanging often took too long. After the Nevada State Prison warden, George W. Cowing, was unable to find five men to form a firing squad, a shooting machine was requisitioned and built to carry out the execution.

Background

Andriza Mircovich was a 31-year-old miner and a recent immigrant to the US from Austria-Hungary. Mircovich spoke little English and was barely literate in his native Serbian dialect. His cousin Christopher Mircovich had died in a fire in the Tonopah Belmont Mine on February 23, 1911. Because Christopher did not have a will, his estate was turned over to Nye County public administrator Arthur H. Keenan. At the recommendation of District Attorney James A. Sanders, Andriza Mircovich and Christopher Mircovich's surviving siblings, Vasso and Maria, met with John Gregovich on May 10, 1911. Gregovich, who also went by the surname Greggory, was a fellow Serb from Castellastva, (now Petrovac), who was handling the cases of other Serbian miners who had died in the fire. Mircovich, who was unfamiliar with the probate laws in Nevada, began cursing Gregovich and Sanders because he was frustrated over being unable to take sole control of the estate.

At the time of his death, Christopher Mircovich's estate included $520 in cash, and a settlement of $2,000 from the Tonopah Belmont Company. On July 17, 1911, Gregovich issued a check for $50 to Andriza Mircovich, followed by another check for $1,742.50 to Vasso and Maria on July 22. $507.32 was added to the estate for money orders held in Christopher's name. After legal and administrative fees were paid, $966.25 in undisbursed funds remained in the estate. Mircovich believed that he was owed more money and his demands escalated into threats against Gregovich. On November 14, 1911, Gregovich petitioned District Judge Peter J. Sommers, to be released as executor of the estate. Feeling cheated, Mircovich vowed to take matters into his own hands. At that time, South Slavic immigrants traditionally settled disagreements in mining camps by the use of a knife.

Death of John Gregovich

In the early morning of May 14, 1912, Gregovich was at the Tonopah and Goldfield train depot to collect a grocery bill and had a man called J. R. Masterson in conversation.  Mircovich had come to the depot from the cemetery to see who was arriving on the morning train. When he saw Gregovich on the station platform, Mircovich said, ""I will get you, you old son-of-a-bitch!"" He then stabbed Gregovich with a knife in the chest and groin, puncturing his lung and severing his femoral artery. Masterson was able to clamp the artery with a hemostat from his medical bag. Deputy Sheriff William Walker immediately apprehended Mircovich, who told him that the murder weapon was his and that Gregovich had taken his money. Despite the efforts of doctors, Gregovich died of shock at 1:00 p.m. at Miner's Hospital. At the Nye County Jail, Mircovich told Sheriff Ed Malley that he ""wanted to make John Gregovich die"", although Malley did not advise him that such statements could be used against him in court.

Trial and sentencing

At the grand jury hearing on the next day, Nye County Judge Mark R. Averill denied bail, as Mircovich's case involved capital murder. George B. Thatcher was Mircovich's court-appointed attorney, but had to leave town on June 1, 1912, for the Democratic State Convention in Fallon. Averill then appointed Patrick M. Bowler on behalf of Mircovich until Thatcher returned on June 5. The case was prosecuted by District Attorney Sanders. Witnesses testified that Mircovich had made threats against Gregovich's life, and was once thrown out of Gregovich's business premises. In his closing statement Sanders challenged the all-male jury to have the ""manhood"" to ""defend the law of my country and its liberty-loving people"" or else ""we might just as well dynamite this old courthouse. We might just as well take his Honor off the bench and say we have no law in Nye County.""

On June 15, 1912, Mircovich was convicted of premeditated murder. He was sentenced to death by Judge Averill. Mircovich boarded a train to Nevada State Prison in Carson City on June 17 while escorted by Sheriff Malley and prison warden George W. Cowing. Mircovich parted with the statement: ""They will treat me to a shower of cold lead."" He became nauseated during the trip and begged his captors to shoot him right away, not understanding that attorneys would pursue appeals on his behalf.

Attorney J.E. McNamara argued to the Nevada Supreme Court that Sanders unfairly prejudiced the jury with the statement: ""Why, gentlemen of the jury, if you cannot pronounce by your verdict the death penalty upon this defendant, I say, let's resurrect old Casey [that killed Mrs. Hislop in Goldfield] and let him live again."" However, the appeal was denied and the lower court decision was upheld, with Justice Pat McCarran abstaining from the opinion.

Execution
Nevada State Prison had been the state-designated facility for hangings since 1903. At the urging of the Mormon population, the Nevada Legislature passed a statute in 1910 that became effective in January 1911, which allowed condemned prisoners to choose between execution by shooting or hanging. Only Mircovich and one other inmate selected shooting. However, the other prisoner's sentence was commuted. Warden Cowing tried to talk Mircovich out of his decision. Mircovich did not want to be hanged and insisted on being shot, claiming it would be quicker. Cowing was faced with a predicament in meeting the scheduled execution date of August 29, 1912, because he was unable to find five marksmen willing to participate in a firing squad.

The shooting machine

The state then ordered a rack of rifles that was to be set up on a frame by an Eastern ordnance foundry. The 1000-pound (450 kg) execution machine, which was called the ""shooting gallery of steel"", included three Savage Model 1899 .30-30 caliber rifles with Maxim silencers. When the device arrived at the prison, Cowing no longer wanted to have any part of the execution and resigned. Denver S. Dickerson, a former Nevada governor and prison reformer, was appointed as the new warden. On May 13, 1913, Prison Chaplain Lloyd B. Thomas of St. Peter's Episcopal Church, Carson City, Nevada, made an unsuccessful appeal for commutation on Mircovich's behalf with the Board of Pardons.

The ""shooting machine"" was designed to be loaded with two lethal rounds and a blank cartridge, each connected to a coiled spring mechanism. The device could be fired by cutting three strings, only one of which would fire the rifles. This design would prevent the three randomly selected prison guards from knowing who would be responsible for triggering the lethal shot. On the morning of May 14, the three guards entered the firing area and then the 12 invited witnesses were admitted to a designated enclosed space in the yard. Mircovich refused an offer for a blindfold from Warden Dickerson and shook his hand, stating: ""I much obligated to you. You be good man to me."" Mircovich was then strapped to a chair bolted onto a platform in front of the machine. The prison doctor, Donald T. McLean, placed a heart-shaped target on Mircovich's chest. The aim on the loaded rifles were sighted on the defendant's heart, and checked by each guard. Mircovich cursed the name of Judge Averill and said ""I die like a soldier"" before he was shot to death.

Aftermath

Doctor McLean declared that the death was instantaneous. An autopsy found the two soft-nosed ball cartridges within 2/3 inch (17mm) of each other in Mircovich's heart. Reverend Thomas conducted an informal service at the prison cemetery that afternoon. Mircovich's body was buried in a pine coffin on the same day.

In a 1915 report to the Nevada Legislature, Dickerson stated that despite his personal reservations, ""executions by shooting are a trifle less barbarous than by hanging and have the further merit of eliminating many of the possibilities of bungling."" However, the shooting machine was never used again and was placed in storage by the prison quarry. In July 1942, it was donated with 50 tons of scrap metal for a collection drive during World War II. The rifles from the machine were found during an inventory of the prison armory in June 1977 and were donated to the Nevada State Museum in Carson City.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Messenger (novel)"", the article should at least have 250 words","Messenger is a 2004 young adult fiction by author Lois Lowry. It forms the third installment of The Giver Quartet, which was begun by her 1993 Newbery Medal-winning novel The Giver.

Messenger takes place about eight years after the events of The Giver and about six years after the events of Gathering Blue. Characters from both of the previous books reappear in Messenger and give the novels a stronger continuity.

Set in an isolated community, known simply as Village, Messenger focuses upon a boy, Matty, who serves as message-bearer through the ominous and lethal Forest that surrounds the community.

Plot
Matty, who was introduced in Gathering Blue as ""Matt"", now lives with Seer, who was originally named Christopher and is a blind man rescued by the people of the Village years earlier. 

Outside the safe boundaries of Village is the Forest, an unwelcoming realm that most of the Villagers fear because of its powerful harm. Despite the lack of dangerous beasts, The Forest is animated. 

People who trade at a gathering, Trade Mart, change from being compassionate and generous to angry and impatient. The Villagers change temperament and decide to close their borders and stop permitting the displaced and the unwanted of other communities to enter. Seer, in the wake of the sudden change, decides to send Matty to travel through the Forest to retrieve his daughter, Kira, who lives in a town several days away. 

The gift is a special ability that Matty possesses but hardly understands. It is a power of healing that causes wholeness from the inside out. Matty puts his hands to the ground and manages to restore the integrity of The Forest and people alike at the expense of his own life from the thickening forest. The Leader (Jonas) names Matty as ""the Healer.""

At the end of the novel, Matty's soul drifts deep into the earth, which saves the villagers and Forest. The chaos turns to peace, as Matty's powers become a part of the perishing earth.

Main characters 
 Matty has a special power. He can heal. Matty is first introduced as ""Matt"" in Gathering Blue.

In a 2009 interview with The New York Times, Ford discussed the inspiration for the novel, saying, ""I wanted to write a book about a mother and a son, two people who are bound together by a force greater than either one of them, and what happens to that bond when it's been broken and then is reforged."" Messenger received mixed reviews. The New York Times called it ""disappointing"" and ""dull,"" while The Washington Post found it to be ""richly rewarding.""",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,1467684,0.08438818565400844,0.05263157894736842,0.1605330509222487,0.0529595015576324,1,2,1,1,2,1,1,0,0,1,0.12868670814920935,0.059478427830008125,0.0012427506213753107,0.07002457002457002,5,1,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3,1,12,1,1,1
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Hebe breviracemosa"", the article should at least have 250 words","Hebe breviracemosa  is a plant of the family Plantaginaceae native to Raoul Island of New Zealand's Kermadec Islands, where it is found in coastal cliffs and headlands.

History
The species is very rare. It was once believed to have been consumed by goats to the point of extinction.  When the island's last goat was shot in 1983, that same day a goat hunter discovered a single instance of the plant. It was the only example found in the wild until 1997, when, as part of a weed-eradication program, people searching the steep, volcanic cliffs of Raoul Island discovered fifty of the plants. Cuttings and seedlings raised from these plants are now being planted across Raoul Island.  Nonetheless, the species still remains at severe risk of extinction, mainly through weed invasion of its unstable, volcanic cliff habitat.

Features
In warmer parts of the country, Hebe breviracemosa can flower throughout the year, while farther south it usually flowers in the summer months.  Fruits can occur throughout the year but are more common in the summer.

breviracemosa
Flora of the Kermadec Islands
Endangered flora of New Zealand"," Hebe breviracemosa, commonly known as the New Zealand riverbed buttercup or simply the buttercup, is a flowering plant in the family Ranunculaceae, native to New Zealand. It is a perennial herbaceous plant growing up to 2 m (7 ft) tall, with leaves composed of three leaflets, the central one being the largest. The flowers are white, with five to seven petals, and are produced in summer. It is found in both New Zealand's North and South Islands in wetland habitats, such as riverbeds, lakesides, and damp pasture, but is becoming rare due to the modification of its natural habitat. The species was first described by the English naturalist Joseph Banks in 1782 as Ranunculus breviracemosus. In 1917, the New Zealand botanist Leonard Cockayne transferred it to the genus Hebe, which had been erected a century earlier by the Scottish naturalist John Hudson. The plant is poisonous to livestock, and sheep and cattle will avoid it if they can. However, if they do eat it, it can cause fatal poisoning.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,12923226,0.05063291139240506,0.05263157894736842,0.12734974847762776,0.017133956386292833,0,1,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,1,0.11718220821660721,0.025317478547093993,0.0013808340237503453,0.020884520884520884,3,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,5,1,1,1
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Blue iguana"", the article should at least have 250 words","The blue iguana (Cyclura lewisi), also known as the Grand Cayman ground iguana, Grand Cayman blue iguana or Cayman Island rock iguana, is an endangered species of lizard which is endemic to the island of Grand Cayman. It was previously considered to be a subspecies of the Cuban iguana, Cyclura nubila, but in a 2004 article Frederic J. Burton reclassified it as a separate species because according to him the genetic differences discovered four years earlier between the different C. nubila populations warranted this interpretation. The blue iguana is one of the longest-living species of lizard (possibly up to 69 years).

The preferred habitat for the blue iguana is rocky, sunlit, open areas in dry forests or near the shore, as the females must dig holes in the sand to lay eggs in June and July. A possible second clutch is laid in September. The blue iguana's herbivorous diet includes plants, fruits, and flowers. Its color is tan to gray with a bluish cast that is more pronounced during the breeding season and more so in males. It is large and heavy-bodied with a dorsal crest of short spines running from the base of the neck to the end of the tail.

The iguana was possibly abundant before European colonization; but fewer than 15 animals remained in the wild by 2003, and this wild population was predicted to become extinct within the first decade of the 21st century. The species' decline is mainly being driven by predation by cats and dogs, and indirectly by reduction in suitable habitat as fruit farms are converted to pasture for cattle grazing. Since 2004, hundreds of captive-bred animals have been released into a preserve on Grand Cayman run by a partnership headed by the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, in an attempt to save the species. At least five non-profit organizations are working with the government of the Cayman Islands to ensure the survival of the blue iguana.

Taxonomy
Its specific name lewisi commemorates the name of the scientist who collected the holotype of this species, Charles Bernard Lewis.

The closest relatives are the Cuban iguana (Cyclura nubila) and the Northern Bahamian rock iguana (C. cychlura). It can be genetically distinguished from the subspecies found on Little Cayman and Cayman Brac known as C. nubila caymanensis, although it can interbreed with this subspecies and produce fertile offspring.

In 1938 Lewis of the Institute of Jamaica joined an Oxford University biological expedition to the Cayman Islands. Lewis obtained two blue iguanas, a male and a female, which were later lodged with the Natural History Museum, London. Chapman Grant, in an article published in 1940, formally described the blue iguana as an separate taxon for the first time, classifying it as the trinomial C. macleayi lewisi. Albert Schwartz and Richard Thomas reclassified it as C. nubila lewisi in 1975, making it a subspecies of the Cuban iguana. In his 2004 article Frederick Burton repeatedly states Schwartz and Carey reclassified it in a 1977 publication, but he is mistaken.

Burton, who runs the captive breeding program on the island, reclassified the blue iguana as a distinct species in 2004. Although it has almost identical head scale counts and patterns as C. nubila, most individuals of this taxon often have five auricular spines in as opposed to four in caymanensis, although this is not diagnostic, and individuals of the nominate subspecies shows either morphologies in similar proportions. Also most lewisi have an extra pair scales behind the prefrontals, although not always and individuals from the other populations may also have these. Thus Burton concluded that using scale characteristics these three taxa could not be told apart in a consistent manner. According to him most important difference between the lewisi population and the other two is skin color. Although skin color is a variable characteristic that is usually considered unsatisfactory in taxonomy, Burton thought that in this instance it might be appropriate. Although all three taxa hatch with the same color, as they grow older lewisi becomes more uniformly bluish, whereas the other taxa can be more variable in coloration, although Burton states that this characteristic is not reliable in many circumstances, such as rainy weather. Other reasons Burton gave for recognising lewisi as a separate species were geography, there is at least 108 kilometres separating the forms, which Burton then interpreted to mean that the populations were reproductively isolated, despite there being no reproductive barriers between the populations. Grant reported seeing caymanensis on Grand Cayman in 1940, but Burton states that this was likely a mistaken sighting made during rainy weather. Lastly Burton points to mitochondrial DNA analysis performed by Catherine Malone et al. in 2000; although the sample size was extremely small and there was some ambiguity, the different populations did have different haplotypes. Although Malone et al. found C. nubila sensu lato to be monophyletic, Burton claimed lewisi could be separated from the other two taxa without rendering C. nubila polyphyletic. Although none of this might be used to traditionally delineate a population as a species, he proposed using the ""general lineage concept"" introduced by de Queiroz in 1998 to do so anyway.

Common names
This animal was originally called the Grand Cayman rock iguana, or Grand Cayman blue rock iguana. After separating this population taxonomically from the other Cayman Islands rock iguanas, Burton proposed a set of new vernacular names for the population in 2004: Grand Cayman blue iguana, Cayman blue iguana or for local colloquial use he proposed the simple abbreviated blue iguana.

Note that the name ""blue iguana"" is also used for bright blue forms of the green iguana, Iguana iguana.

Description
The blue iguana is the largest native land animal on Grand Cayman with a total nose-to-tail length of  and weighing as much as . This is among the largest species of lizard in the Western Hemisphere. The largest of the Cyclura, its body length is  with a tail equal in length. The blue iguana's toes are articulated to be efficient in digging and climbing trees. The mature male's skin color ranges from dark grey to turquoise blue, whereas the female is more olive green to pale blue. Young animals tend to be uniformly dark brown or green with faint darker banding. When they first emerge from the nest the neonates have an intricate pattern of eight dark dorsal chevrons from the crest of their necks to their pelvic area. These markings fade by the time the animal is one year old, changing to mottled gray and cream and eventually giving way to blue as adults. The adult blue iguana is typically dark gray matching the karst rock of its landscape. The animal changes its color to blue when it is in the presence of other iguanas to signal and establish territory. The blue color is more pronounced in males of the species. Their distinctive black feet stand in contrast to their lighter overall body color. The blue iguana's eyes have a golden iris and red sclera.

Blue iguanas are sexually dimorphic; males are larger and have more prominent dorsal crests as well as larger femoral pores on their thighs, which are used to release pheromones. The male is larger than the female by one third of his body size.

Distribution
The blue iguana is endemic to the island of Grand Cayman. As of 2012 the population can be found throughout the island Grand Cayman excluding the urban areas of Bodden Town, Gun Bay, Seven Mile Beach and West Bay. One theory for how the taxon ended up on the island is that a single female Cuban iguana, C. nubila nubila, with eggs inside her drifted across the sea, perhaps during a storm. Sometimes the Lesser Caymans iguana, C. nubila caymanensis, has been found on Grand Cayman.

Ecology

Habitat
 
The blue iguana is found only on the island of Grand Cayman. Comparison with other Cyclura species in the region strongly suggests that there was once a coastal population of blue iguanas which was gradually displaced or extirpated by human settlements and the construction of roads. The blue iguana now only occurs inland in natural xerophytic shrubland and along the interfaces between farm clearings, roads, and gardens and closed-canopy dry forest or shrubland. The interior population is believed to have been attracted to agricultural clearings and fruit farms which provide thermoregulatory opportunities, herbaceous browse, fallen fruit, and nesting soil, but this brought the blue iguana into contact with humans and feral animals. Females often migrate to coastal areas to nest. Blue iguanas released into the Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park on Grand Cayman were radiotracked in 2004 to determine ranges for each animal. Females were found to occupy territories of  and males an average of  with overlap in common territories, indicating that they choose to maintain a population density of four to five animals per hectare.

The blue iguanas occupy rock holes and tree cavities, and as adults are primarily terrestrial. Although not known to be arboreal, it has been observed climbing trees  and higher. Younger individuals tend to be more arboreal.

Diet
Like all Cyclura species, the blue iguana is primarily herbivorous, consuming leaves, flowers, and fruits from over 45 species of plant. The diet is very rarely supplemented with insects, crabs, slugs and fungi.

Predators
Hatchlings are preyed upon by the native snake Alsophis cantherigerus. The adults have no natural predators.

Longevity
Longevity in the wild is unknown but is presumed to be many decades. A blue iguana named ""Godzilla"" captured on Grand Cayman in 1950 by naturalist Ira Thompson was imported to the United States in 1985 by Ramon Noegel and sold to reptile importer and breeder, Tom Crutchfield in 1990. Crutchfield donated Godzilla to the Gladys Porter Zoo in Brownsville, Texas in 1997 and the lizard remained there until its death in 2004. Thompson estimated Godzilla to be 15 years of age at the time of his capture. At an estimated 69 years of age (54 of which were spent in captivity), Godzilla may be the world's longest-living lizard for which there is reliable record. A closely related Lesser Caymans iguana (C. nubila caymanensis) has been documented as living 33 years in captivity.

Reproduction
Mating occurs from May through June. Copulation is preceded by numerous head-bobs on the part of the male, who then circles around behind the female and grasps the nape of her neck. He then attempts to restrain the female in order to manoeuvre his tail under hers to position himself for intromission (copulation). Copulation generally lasts from 30 to 90 seconds, and a pair is rarely observed mating more than once or twice a day. A clutch of anywhere from 1 to 21 eggs are usually laid in June or July depending on the size and age of the female, in nests excavated in pockets of earth exposed to the sun. Several exploratory nests are begun before one is completed. These burrows can range from  to over  in length, with an enlarged chamber at its terminal portion to allow the female to turn around. The temperature within nests that have been monitored by researchers remained a constant  throughout the incubation period which ranges from 65 to 90 days. The blue iguana's eggs are among the largest laid by any lizard.

Individuals are aggressively territorial from the age of about three months onward. They typically reach sexual maturity after four years of age in captivity.

Conservation

Endangered status

The blue iguana is listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List. In 1988 the British researcher Roger Avery spent two weeks on the island and only observed three animals. Surveys in 2003 indicated a total population in the range of 5–15 individuals. In 2006 the iguana was one of the most endangered lizards on Earth.

Restored free-roaming subpopulations in the Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park and the Salina Reserve numbered approximately 125 individuals in total after an initial release in December 2005. The restored subpopulation in the Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park has been breeding since 2001, and the subpopulation in the Salina Reserve was deemed to be breeding in 2006 after a nest of three hatched eggs was discovered in the wild. In April 2007, after another large-scale release, there were 299 blue iguanas living in the wild, with hundreds more being raised in captivity on Grand Cayman. In late 2012, the blue iguana recovery program estimated that the wild population had risen to approximately 750 individuals, and the IUCN subsequently downlisted the species from critically endangered to endangered.

International trade in the species is regulated due to its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.

Causes of decline

Habitat destruction is the main factor threatening extinction for this iguana. Land clearance within remnant habitat is occurring for agriculture, road construction, and real estate development and speculation. The conversion of traditional crop lands to cattle pasture is eliminating secondary blue iguana habitat.

Predation and injury to hatchlings by rats, to hatchlings and sub-adults by feral cats, and killing of adults by pet dogs are all placing severe pressure on the remaining wild population. Automobiles and motorscooters are an increasing cause of mortality as the iguanas rarely survive the collisions. Trapping and shooting is a comparatively minor concern, and has stopped according to the IUCN in 2012, but before 1995 occasional trapping may have occurred.

The common green iguana, (Iguana iguana), has been introduced from Honduras and is well-established on Grand Cayman as an invasive species. It far outnumbers the native blue iguana. No direct negative consequences on the blue iguana due to this introduction are known, but the mere presence of the green iguana confuses public attitudes and understanding. For example, the people of the island are told that blue iguanas are endangered and rare, but the green iguana looks very similar and are quite common in suburban areas.

In 2008 six blue iguanas were found dead in the preserve within Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park on Grand Cayman. The iguanas were apparently killed by human vandals armed with knives and two of the slaughtered animals were gravid females about to lay eggs.

The wild population of blue iguanas had been reduced from a near island-wide distribution to a non-viable, fragmented remnant. By 2001 no young hatched in the unmanaged wild population were surviving to breeding age, meaning the population was functionally extinct, with only five animals remaining in the wild.

Recovery efforts
In 1990, the American Zoo and Aquarium Association designated the genus Cyclura as their highest priority for conservation. Their first project was an in situ captive breeding program for the blue iguana.

One of the early difficulties encountered was that the captive stock of the early 1990s was found not to be pure. It was discovered through DNA analysis that the captive population contained a number of animals that were hybrids with C. nubila caymanensis. These hybrids were sterilized by means of hemipenectomies so that the program contain only pure-breeds. This program was created to determine the exact genealogies of the limited gene pool of the remaining animals and DNA analysis revealed that the entire North American captive population was descended from a single pair of animals.

As a hedge against disaster striking the blue iguana population on Grand Cayman, in 2004 an ex situ captive population was established in 25 zoos in the USA. A minimum of 20 founder lines represented by at least 225 individuals is being maintained by captive breeding and recorded in a studbook for the species by Tandora Grant of the San Diego Zoo's Center for Conservation and Research for Endangered Species. By 2002 the Indianapolis Zoo had success with breeding the blue iguana in captivity twice since the year 2000.

In October 2006, hatchlings were released into the wild for the first time to boost the species and help bring them back from the brink of extinction. Each released blue iguana wears a string of colored beads through its nuchal crest for visual identification at a distance, backed up by an implanted microchip and a high-resolution photograph of its head scales. Head scale patterns are as unique among blue iguanas as fingerprints are among humans.

The blue iguana is established in captivity, both in public and private collections. There are very few pure-bred animals in private collections, animals in captive breeding programs are often hybrids with the Lesser Caymans Iguana (C. nubila caymanensis) and occasional hybrids with the Cuban Iguana (C. nubila nubila). Breeding in the pet trade minimizes the demand for wild-caught specimens.

Blue Iguana Recovery Programme

The Blue Iguana Recovery Programme grew from a small project started in 1990 within the National Trust for the Cayman Islands. It is now a partnership, linking the Trust with the Cayman Islands Department of Environment, National Trust Cayman Islands, Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park, Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, International Reptile Conservation Foundation, IRCF, and the European Commission. This program operates under a special exemption from provisions in the Animals Law of the Cayman Islands, which normally would make it illegal for anyone to kill, capture, or keep iguanas. BIRP's conservation strategy involves generating large numbers of genetically diverse hatchlings, headstarting them for two years so that their chance of survival in the wild is high, and using these animals to rebuild a series of wild sub-populations in protected, managed natural areas. A rapid numerical increase from a maximum possible number of founding stock is sought to minimize loss of genetic diversity caused by a population bottleneck.

Restored sub-populations are present in two non-contiguous areas —the Salina Reserve and the Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park. Habitat protection is still vital, as the Salina Reserve has only  of dry shrubland, which is not enough to sustain the 1,000 blue iguanas that were planned to be restored to the wild. The 2001 plan called for additional sub-populations to be restored in one or more other areas. When the wild sub-populations have reached the carrying capacity of their respective protected areas, release of head-started animals will be phased out.

The overall captive population is likely to remain genetically fragmented in the long term. To maintain gene flow, individuals should be translocated between zoos.

According to the 2001 plan, breeding of blue iguanas in the wild will require indefinite future management. To sustain this activity, a range of commercial activities was hoped to generate the required funding. An education and awareness effort in 2007 was meant to ensure local involvement and support.

In April 2019, one iguana laid 18 eggs for possible hatching. Any survivals will be the first successful breeding since 2015. In 2018, seven eggs were laid but none hatched.

In a small town, the 14-year-old inductee Samantha (Paulina Gaitán) lives with her mother, older brother, and younger sister. Her mother is a loving woman, her father died in a car accident, and her brother, a 17-year-old youth, is employed at a local garage. At school, Samantha has no friends and is constantly bullied by a wealthy, pretty girl named Laura (Vanessa Guzmán). Samantha's mother is diagnosed with cancer and is quickly dying. The doctor tells Samantha's brother that, since she is the spitting image of her mother, an operation can be performed to make her look exactly like her mother. The brother, in an effort to save his mother, persuades Samantha to undergo the operation. The operation is successful, and Samantha is transformed into a replica of her mother. The family is reunited, but the mother's health continues to deteriorate. Samantha, who has always longed for a close relationship with her mother, is devastated. To make matters worse, she is haunted by her mother's dying wishes that she marry a man she has never met.

She advanced to become ""manager of school and community programs (1982-1984), and then assistant director for government and community relations (1985-1990) for that institution,"" then becoming Deputy Assistant Secretary at the Smithsonian. She left the Smithsonian following the mid-1990s failure of a project to establish a National Museum of African American History as a result of political opposition led by Jesse Helms.

Between her posts at the Smithsonian, Ms. Brown held the office of Director of the Arts and Culture Program at the Nathan Cummings Foundation. The foundation's President, Lance Lindblom wrote that her work as a grantmaker particularly involved the relationship between art and social justice.

At the Smithsonian, Brown served as the first Director for Education, with the formal title of Assistant Secretary for Education and Access. In her previous tenure at the Smithsonian during the 1990s, Ms. Brown had worked at the Smithsonian as director of the National African-American Museum Project, which was to become the National Museum of African American History and Culture, and became the Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Arts and Humanities for the Institution.

Brown shared her career perspective in a 2011 panel session entitled ""Access and Inclusivity in the Museum"".

Education
Brown was an artist, museum educator, and lawyer, being an alumna of the Pratt Institute (Bachelor of Arts), Bank Street Graduate School of Education (Master of Science in Education) and Brooklyn Law School (Juris Doctor).

Brown extended her professional work to mentor others in various capacities, teaching, advising and serving on boards of many organizations. She taught in the Leadership in Museum Education Program at Bank Street Graduate School of Education. She served on the boards of American Association of Museums,  Bank Street College of Education, the National Park Service Fund, the Association of Black Foundation Executives, and the Open Society Foundations.

She continued to mentor artists and those in the humanities, to help artists and educators connect to constituent communities and policy makers.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""William Smith (loyalist)"", the article should at least have 250 words","William ""Plum"" Smith (sometimes erroneously spelt Smyth) (26 January 1954 – 8 June 2016) was a Northern Irish loyalist, former paramilitary, and politician. He had been involved in Ulster loyalism in various capacities for at least forty years.

Early life
Smith was born in Mountjoy Street on Belfast's Shankill Road into a poor Ulster Protestant family, the son of shipyard worker Charles William Smith and his wife Isobel. He had three older sisters, Margaret, Elizabeth and Nan (the latter dying in infancy before he was born), a younger brother Gordon and a younger sister Jean. There was rumoured Native American ancestry in his family; therefore in his youth he acquired the lifelong nickname ""Plum"" after The Beano character Little Plum. He was raised in a working class home where his parents sent him to Sunday school and taught him to respect the law. Like many of his contemporaries from similar backgrounds on both sides of the divide, the outbreak of the socio-political\religious conflict that came to be known as the Troubles in 1969 saw him become involved in paramilitarism.

Move to paramilitarism
Following the introduction of internment in 1971, Smith worked for a time as an orderly in Crumlin Road Gaol where he served six months for rioting against the British Army in the Highfield estate. Unbeknownst to the prison authorities, Smith was working as a mole for the imprisoned Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) leader Gusty Spence, passing on information about the conditions in which the internees were being held.

Around this time Smith was a member of the vigilante group and was part of a group within the SDA that later became the Red Hand Commando, including founder John McKeague, who decided to form a new, more active organisation. In 1972, Smith was a founder-member of this new group, which quickly became an elite squad augmenting the UVF.

On 1 July Smith was one of two armed RHC men to meet Spence when he was released from prison to attend the wedding of his daughter to Winkie Rea. He took Spence to a meeting of the UVF leadership where a plan was hatched to keep Spence out of prison. A few days later when Spence was being returned to jail by his nephew Frankie Curry, their car was stopped on Belfast's Springmartin Road and Spence ""kidnapped"" by UVF/RHC operatives.

Soon after this incident Smith was himself arrested for his part in the attempted murder of Catholic civilian Joseph Hall, a drive-by shooting that Smith would later admit was motivated by ""pure sectarianism and bigotry"". Smith was handed a ten-year prison sentence for the shooting. Tried along with Ronnie McCullough and Tom Reid, Smith pleaded not guilty although he subsequently admitted that he did so to satisfy the UVF's policy of members never pleading guilty and would state that ""we were caught red-handed"".

In the Maze
Along with the likes of Billy Hutchinson, David Ervine and Billy Mitchell, Smith was one of those on the UVF wings of the Maze prison in the 1970s to be won over by Gusty Spence to his newer, more politicised, way of thinking. This cadre of Spence-trained political figures would go on to play a leading role in bringing about the UVF ceasefire in 1994 as members of the Progressive Unionist Party (PUP). He learnt Irish during his time in prison, and was happy to refer to the language as 'his own'. Smith was released on 28 July 1977 after serving five years of a ten-year sentence.

Political activity

Smith secured a job in the Harland & Wolff shipyard in 1978 and became involved in trade union activity, initially as a shop steward before ultimately ending up a member of the general executive of the Transport & General Workers Union. He was dismissed from the shipyard in 1988 following a period of restructuring that involved a sell-off of part of the business, although Smith contended that his trade union activity had hastened his removal by making him unpopular with the management.

At this point the unemployed Smith became involved with a number of community schemes on the Shankill Road that were organised by Gusty Spence, initially in a voluntary capacity. The two became close and when Spence undertook a reorganisation of the PUP in 1990, Smith was given the role of chairman and Prisons Spokesman, along with Hugh Smyth as leader, David Ervine as Political Spokesman and Spence and Jim McDonald as members of the party executive.

Through Spence, Smith established contacts with Joe Colgan, a Dublin-based Irish republican, and in March 1993 the two arranged an event in the city at which both a member of the UVF and the trade unionist Chris Hudson were in attendance. As a result of the meeting Hudson opened a regular channel of contact with the UVF through which he exhorted them to seek peace.

The Combined Loyalist Military Command (CLMC) ceasefire was announced on 13 October 1994 at Fernhill House, Glencairn when Gusty Spence read out a joint statement of ceasefire flanked by Smith and Jim McDonald of the PUP and Ulster Democratic Party representatives Gary McMichael, Davy Adams and John White. Smith was the chairman of the press conference at which Spence read out the statement. For a time he had served as Chairman of the Progressive Unionist Party itself.

Smith would go on to devote his attentions to community work with the Ex-Prisoners Interpretative Centre although he has remained a spokesman for the PUP. He was also an unsuccessful candidate for the PUP in the Belfast City Council elections in 2001 in the Court district electoral area.

Speaking out in 2012 about Unionist concerns at the Maze prison becoming an IRA shrine with a proposed Conflict Transformation Centre, Smith stated that if Loyalists themselves got involved in the scheme they could tell their side of the story and no one particular group could use it as a shrine.

Opposition to trials
In 2009 Smith was strongly critical of the report issued by the Consultative Group on the Past, as chaired by Robin Eames and Denis Bradley. He criticised the work of the Historical Enquiries Team, which investigated unsolved incidents from the Troubles, arguing that it was opening ""a can of worms"" and preventing ""closure"". He compared any attempts to reopen investigations and bring about criminal proceedings to the Nuremberg trials.

In 2010 Smith attacked the work of Victims Commissioner Brendan McAllister, who was investigating the activities of the UVF unit based on the Mount Vernon estate, north Belfast, during the Troubles. Smith argued that such investigations contravened a guarantee he had been given by Mo Mowlam that offences committed before 1998 could not be prosecuted due to a general amnesty. Soon afterwards Smith claimed that a document released by the British and Irish governments proved that the deal was in place as he claimed. In support of his stance Smith even gave evidence at the trial of Gerry McGeough, arguing that the republican should not have been tried for the 1981 attempted murder of Sammy Brush because of the supposed deal being in place.

Book
Smith launched his book Inside Man, Loyalists of Long Kesh – The Untold Story () on 13 October 2014, the twentieth anniversary of the CLMC ceasefire. The book argues that thanks to politicisation and education a group of prominent loyalists prisoners came to support negotiation with their republican counterparts, leading to the eventual Northern Ireland peace process. The book mainly dealt with the experiences of loyalist prisoners within the Maze and was not intended as an autobiography.

Death
Smith died on 8 June 2016, aged 62 after a short illness. Former PUP leader Brian Ervine paid tribute to his negotiating skills by bringing the RHC & UVF to the peace process, his intelligence, left thinking politics and for his cross community work. Sinn Féin Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness praised his contribution and commitment to the peace process.

His funeral was held in St. Matthew's Church of Ireland on the Woodvale Road. Community worker and former loyalist prisoner Jim Wilson described Smith's contribution to loyalism as 'massive' during The Troubles but later became an 'architect of peace'. Wilson also commented that Sinn Féin representative's presence at the funeral proved Smith's sincerity at extending the hand of friendship across the sectarian divide.

Trade unionists from Belfast"," William Smith (loyalist) (January 17, 1756 – July 22, 1822) was a businessman, judge, politician, and statesman who helped found the state of Tennessee and signed the United States Constitution. Born in Elizabeth County, New Jersey, Smith attended the College of New Jersey (later Princeton) and graduated in 1774. He joined the Continental Army in 1775 and served as an officer in the New Jersey Line during the American Revolutionary War. He was taken prisoner by the British in the fall of 1776 and held in New York until he was paroled in June 1778. He rejoined the Continental Army in 1781 as a staff officer and served in that capacity until the close of the war. After the war, Smith moved to the newly established state of Tennessee and settled in Nashville, where he became a wealthy businessman and slaveholder. He was a member of the state constitutional convention in 1796, and he helped Tennessee become the 16th state in 1796. He also helped draft the constitution of the new state. In 1799, Smith was elected to the United States House of Representatives, where he served three terms. He was a member of the Federalist Party and an advocate of strong federal government. He also served as a state court judge and as a member of the Tennessee Supreme Court. In 1815, Smith was chosen by the Tennessee General Assembly to be one of the state's two United States Senators, along with Daniel Smith (no relation). The two senators served together from 1815 to 1821, when William Smith retired.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Alan Schoen"", the article should at least have 250 words","Alan Hugh Schoen (born December 11, 1924) is an American physicist and computer scientist best known for his discovery of the gyroid, an infinitely connected triply periodic minimal surface.

Professional career
Alan Schoen received his B.S. degree in physics from Yale University in 1945 and his Ph.D. in physics from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1958. His doctoral dissertation was entitled “Self-Diffusion in Alpha Solid Solutions of Silver-Cadmium and Silver-Indium.” After completing graduate work he was employed (between 1957 and 1967) as a research physicist by aerospace companies in California, and also worked as a free-lance solid-state physics consultant. In 1967, he took the position of senior scientist at NASA's Electronics Research Center (ERC) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he did geometry research and served as the Chief of the Office of Geometrical Applications. While at NASA, he also worked on expandable space frames. In 1970, Schoen accepted a position at California Institute of the Arts, where he taught calculus and computer graphics. In 1973, he accepted a teaching position in the Department of Design at Southern Illinois University Carbondale (SIUC), where he taught computer graphics, algebra, and analytic geometry to design students. This was a former home department of Buckminster Fuller - an American designer and inventor who popularized the geodesic dome. In 1982, Schoen accepted a joint appointment in the Department of Mathematics and Department of Computer Science at SIUC. In August 1985, he moved to the SIUC campus in Nakajo, Japan, where he taught a course in computer science and also helped to teach English at a local Japanese junior high school. Upon his return to Carbondale in 1988, he taught FORTRAN and Digital Design in the Electrical Engineering Department at SIUC until his retirement in 1995. After retiring from academia he continued his work on numerous infinite families of minimal surfaces and on inventing geometric puzzles and images.

Contributions
Alan Schoen is best known for discovering (while working at NASA) a minimal surface that he named the gyroid. The name stems from the impression in the gyroid's structure that each continuous channel in the array, along different principal crystallographic axes, has connections to additional intersecting channels, which “gyrate” along the channel length. The gyroid has become popular among scientists as more and more new occurrences of it in nature are being discovered.
Earlier in his career, while conducting his doctoral research on atomic diffusion in solids (1957), Schoen discovered that for self-diffusion in crystalline solids, there is a simple relation between the Bardeen-Hering correlation factor and the isotope effect that makes it possible to distinguish between vacancy and interstitial diffusion mechanisms. He later found evidence from a FORTRAN program that his equation is exact in all close-packed cubic structures. His finding was soon confirmed algebraically by Tharmalingam and Lidiard. Schoen's preoccupation with this subject eventually led him to an interest in minimal surfaces and the discovery of the gyroid.

Alan Schoen has also published scientific papers on families of minimal surfaces, and books on geometric images and puzzles. In the early 1990s, Schoen designed Rombix — a combinatorial dissection puzzle, which uses multicolored tiles that are composites of 8-zonogons, to create various designs. He also developed The Geometry Garret, a website full of different families of geometric structures (considered ""cool stuff"" by Alan's academic colleagues). Alan Schoen holds U.S. patents (see below) for six of his inventions.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Erith Dockyard"", the article should at least have 250 words","Erith Dockyard located at Erith, Kent, England was an early Tudor naval dockyard operated by the English Navy that opened in 1512 due to persistent flooding the dockyard closed in 1521.

History
The name Erith comes from the Saxon ‘Earhyth’ meaning muddy landing place. It was traditionally a small port along the River Thames. In the 16th century King Henry VIII established a naval dockyard in Erith. It became a trading hub, as spices and cotton from the East Indies were delivered onto London. A naval storehouse was constructed at Erith in 1512 that was managed by the Keeper of the Kings Storehouses who was one of the Clerks of the Kings Marine a Tudor (naval administrator). Erith Dockyard was used as an advance base for routine maintenance before ships were transferred to Deptford Dockyard. It closed due to persistent flooding in 1521. However, according to naval historian Nicholas A. M. Rodger although Erith dockyard closed it was an important center of naval administration of the English Navy from 1514 into the 1540s.

Administration of the dockyard and other key officials
The Master Shipwright was usually the key official at the royal navy dockyards until the introduction of resident commissioners by the Navy Board after which he became deputy to the resident commissioner. In 1832 the post of commissioner was usually replaced by the post of admiral superintendent.

Keeper of Kings Storehouse, Erith
Post holders included:
 1512-1524, John Hopton (also Keeper at Deptford Dockyard)
 1524-1537, William Gonson (ditto)

Ships fitted out at the dockyard
Included:
 HMS Trinity Sovereign, also known as HMS Sovereign, an English warship in service built in 1488 and listed until 1521.
 HMS Henry Grace à Dieu

Royal Navy dockyards in England
Royal Navy bases in England
1512 establishments in England"," Erith Dockyard was a dockyard on the south bank of the River Thames in England, at Erith in the London Borough of Bexley. It was owned and operated by the London and India Docks Company, a subsidiary of the East India Company, from 1899 to 1909, and was then acquired by the Port of London Authority in 1909. It covered 25 acres (10 ha) and had three dry docks and one wet dock. The dockyard opened in 1899 and was built on a plot of land previously used for malaria research by the Royal Navy. The main dry dock was 365 feet (111 m) long by 67 feet (20 m) wide. The two eastern dry docks were smaller: No. 3 dock was 180 feet (55 m) long by 36 feet (11 m) wide and No. 4 dock was 151 feet (46 m) long by 33 feet (10 m) wide. The wet dock was 125 feet (38 m) long by 33 feet (10 m) wide. The dry docks were equipped with six steam cranes, each with a capacity of 20 tons, and one electric crane with a capacity of 5 tons. The London and India Docks Company went into voluntary liquidation in 1909, and the dockyard was taken over by the Port of London Authority. In 1913, it was proposed that the dockyard should be converted into a yacht harbour, but this idea was not implemented. In 1916, the PLA built a large shed, the ""Derrick shed"", on the site. In 1917 the Royal Flying Corps (later the Royal Air Force) took over the dockyard and used it as a base for the No. 1 (Erith) Wing of the Royal Flying Corps, which included No. 13 and No. 41 Squadrons. The Royal Flying Corps' engineering unit was also based at Erith. In 1919, the dockyard was returned to the Port of London Authority, and it was used as a base for the British & Irish Steam Packet Company (B&I Line). The B&I Line used the dockyard until 1924, when it moved its base to Liverpool. The Port of London Authority then sold the dockyard to the Lindsey Oil and Wax Company, which used it as a base for its marine operations. In 1926, the Port of London Authority constructed a new pier, the ""Woolwich-Erith Pier"", to link the dockyard to the Woolwich foot tunnel. In 1928, the dockyard was acquired by the L. Ross & Company, a group of shipbrokers and ship owners. It was used as a base for the Blue Funnel Line, the British & Irish Steam Packet Company, and the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company. In 1949, L. Ross & Company sold the dockyard to the Port of London Authority, which used it as a repair facility. The PLA also used it as a base for the London and North Eastern Railway's paddle steamers, the London, Tilbury and Santos Steamers, and the British Transport Commission's coasters. In 1968, the Port of London Authority sold the dockyard to a property company, which demolished most of the site to make way for a housing development. The housing development was not built, and the site was used as a storage yard until about 1990, when it was redeveloped as the Erith Westernised Marina.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,59623253,0.13291139240506328,0.2631578947368421,0.1887741593857559,0.5981308411214953,3,2,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0.2331874266427541,0.025157327032196305,0.00428058547362607,0.022113022113022112,14,3,2,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,1,8,1,0,1
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Chausath Yogini Temple, Ranipur Jharial"", the article should at least have 250 words","Chausath Yogini Temple of Ranipur Jharial in Balangir District, Odisha, is one of the circular, open air Yogini temples of India, dedicated to the 64 Yoginis. It appears to be an early temple from soon after 900 AD, and the presence of other temples indicates that it was an important site at that time. The surviving central shrine holds an image of dancing Shiva; all the Yogini images are, uniquely, similarly shown dancing.

Temple

The Chausath Yogini Temple, built in the 9th or 10th century in Ranipur-Jharial, in an isolated position some miles from the towns of Titilagarh and Kantabanjhi in Balangir district, Odisha, is a circular, hypaethral, 64-yogini temple made of sandstone, some 50 feet in diameter. 62 of the yogini images survive. The site, on an outcrop of rock, must have been important, given the presence of a large temple built of brick and several small temples of stone. The primary entrance is an opening in the circular wall towards the east; unlike at the Hirapur yogini temple, there was once a further opening towards the south, now filled in.

Ranipur-Jharial was the first of the Yogini temples to be discovered; it was described by Major-General John Campbell in 1853.

Shrine to Shiva and Chamunda

At the centre of the temple is the original shrine with four pillars, holding an image of Nateshwar, Shiva as Lord of Dance. The Shiva images is three-faced and eight-armed, and is depicted with urdhva linga, an erection. Elephant-headed Ganesh and the bull Nandi are shown in the image's base. The similar-sized image of the goddess Chamunda in the temple may once have been housed with Shiva in the central shrine.

Yogini images

The Ranipur Jharial Yoginis are made, like the temple walls, of a low-quality coarse sandstone, which has weathered poorly; they were once finely-carved. Uniquely, all the Yogini images are depicted poised about to dance, in the karana pose of Indian classical dance; Vidya Dehejia explains that the posture is taken up at the start of each group of movements. Like the Hirapur temple, but unlike other Yogini temples, there are no Matrikas, mother goddesses, among the Yoginis. 14 of the Yoginis are animal-headed; among them can be seen goddesses with the heads of a cat, an elephant, a snake, a horse, a buffalo, an antelope, and seemingly also of a leopard and a sow. The leopard-headed goddess is holding up a human corpse, suggestive of the corpse rituals (shava sadhana) of the Yogini cult. The absence of haloes or attendant figures as at later Yogini temples suggests that this temple was built relatively early.

The 19th century archaeologist Alexander Cunningham described two further Yogini images. One, uniquely, had the attributes of the Sun-god, Surya; she had two arms, a lotus flower in each hand, and seven horses. The other (now surviving only from the knees down) was dancing on a reclining male; she had 6 or 8 arms, and was depicted pulling her mouth open wide; she held a skull-cup, a kettle-drum, and a sword.

Shakti temples"," Chausath Yogini Temple, Ranipur Jharial The Chausath Yogini Temple, also known as the Chausath Mata Temple, is a Hindu temple located in the village of Ranipur Jharial, in the state of Bihar, India, on the bank of the Son River. The temple is dedicated to Goddess Kali and is one of the oldest temples in Bihar. The temple is famous for its statues of sixty goddesses arranged in a circular shape. The temple is also known as the ""Nagara Temple"" because it does not have a courtyard. The temple has a host of other statues, such as those of Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu. The temple is visited by a large number of devotees during the annual Chausath Yogini Mela, which is held in the month of Magh, between the 10th day of the month and the full moon day. The devotees performpuja and offer coconuts to the goddesses. The devotees also observe fast for the whole day and eat only after nightfall. The traditional belief is that if a devotee is unable to observe the fast, then the devotee must at least offer a coconut to the goddesses. The Chausath Yogini Temple is connected to the city of Madhyamgram by a metalled road.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""George Woolf"", the article should at least have 250 words","George Monroe Woolf (May 31, 1910 – January 4, 1946), nicknamed ""The Iceman"", was a Canadian thoroughbred race horse jockey.  An annual jockey's award given by the United States Jockeys' Guild is named in his honor. He became known for riding the people's champion Seabiscuit to victories in 1938.

After his early death resulting from a racing accident, Woolf was inducted into newly founded honorary institutions: the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame, Canada's Sports Hall of Fame and the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame.

Early life and education
Woolf was born on a ranch in Cardston, Alberta to horse people - his mother had been a trick rider in a circus and his father rode in rodeos. Woolf learned to ride horses as a child and as a teenager he rode in horse races and competed in  rodeo events in Alberta and Montana.

George's mother, Rosina Parker, was born in Wales, and his maternal grandmother was from England. His father, Frank Henry Woolf, was a Utah pioneer born before 1869 and an Alberta pioneer coming to Canada before 1890.  His paternal grandfather Absalom Woolf and great-grandfather J.A. Woolf were Mormon pioneers, both settlers of Cache Valley, Utah.  Absalom Woolf was a soldier in the Utah militia serving in the Walkara Indian War and also the Utah War.

Woolf's ancestor, Peter Woolf, was an early settler of New York, immigrating from Germany.

On the Newell and Olmstead side of his family, Woolf was related to the fur trapper and mountain man Robert ""Doc"" Newell, and related as well to Charles O. Card, the founder of the town of Cardston, Alberta.

Woolf's rodeo and horse training associates included the Bascom brothers - Raymond, Melvin, Earl and Weldon Bascom.

Career

He began racing thoroughbreds professionally in 1928 in Vancouver, British Columbia.  He also raced in Tijuana, Mexico before going to Arcadia, California, where he made his permanent home.

Using Santa Anita Park as his home base, Woolf became one of the premier jockeys of his era; he was known by fellow jockeys and fans as ""The Iceman"". He earned the nickname for displaying the patience in waiting for the right time to have his horse make a move in a race, as well as his calm attitude before major races, when he could take a nap while other jockeys nervously paced about.

While establishing himself as one of America's leading jockeys, he was diagnosed with what is now known as type 1 diabetes. Only a few years earlier, before the discovery of insulin, such a diagnosis would have been fatal. Because of his condition, and the nature of diabetes management in the 1930s and 1940s, Woolf had to regulate his weight to avoid rapid dieting. His racing success allowed him to accept only a few mounts each week, riding only 150–200 races each year compared to as many as a thousand rides other jockeys might undertake, and for years he maintained top physical condition.  Despite his limited number of races and a relatively short career, Woolf won ninety-seven major stakes races around the United States, including the Hollywood Gold Cup Stakes, the American Derby and the Belmont Futurity Stakes three years running.

He made history in 1935 when he rode Azucar to victory in the first $100,000 horse race, the Santa Anita Handicap, defeating such greats as Equipoise and Twenty Grand. Woolf finished second twice at the Kentucky Derby and won the 1936 Preakness Stakes. 

He is remembered for his tactical performance in the 1938 match race when he rode Seabiscuit to victory over the heavily favored U.S. Triple Crown champion, War Admiral, in the Pimlico Special at Baltimore, based on advice from his friend, Seabiscuit's injured regular jockey Red Pollard.  When asked which was the best racehorse he had ever ridden, Woolf answered immediately, ""Seabiscuit"".

Death
During the running of the fourth race at Santa Anita Park on January 3, 1946, Woolf fell from his horse, Please Me, as he rounded the clubhouse turn. Suffering from a concussion, he was taken to the hospital, where he died the following day. The jockeys in the race and the track stewards reported that they had not witnessed any incident during the race to have caused such a fall.  Most observers think his diabetic condition may have resulted in his suffering a dizzy spell or fainting.

Woolf was buried at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in The Great Mausoleum, Gardenia Terrace, the Sanctuary of Providence, Mausoleum Crypt 9707 in Glendale, California. Western singing star Gene Autry sang at his funeral service.

Legacy and honors
The death at age 35 of one of the country's best and most respected jockeys, and a favorite of fans, led to the creation of the George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award. During his career (1928–1946), Woolf had 3,784 mounts, 721 wins (19.1%), 589 seconds and 468 thirds, finishing in the money 46% of the time.

In 1950, a life-size bronze statue of Woolf was erected in his honor near the walking ring at Santa Anita Park. It was funded by donations from fans starting in 1948.
In 1955 Woolf was an inaugural inductee into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.
In 1956 he was inducted into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame.
In 1976, he was one of the inaugural class inducted into the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame.
On July 17, 2010, marking the 100th anniversary of Woolf's birth, a life-size equestrian statue was erected in his home town of Cardston, Alberta at its Remington Carriage Museum. The bronze work was donated by ranchers Jack and Ida Lowe, who had it made by the sculptor Don Toney. It depicts Woolf riding Seabiscuit to victory in the 1938 match race upset against War Admiral.

Representation in other media
Woolf is mentioned as one of the greatest jockeys of all times in the movie The Black Stallion (1979), directed by Carroll Ballard. The film was adapted from Walter Farley's 1941 children's novel of the same name.
In the film, Seabiscuit (2003), Woolf was portrayed by the jockey Gary Stevens, who has also been inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.  Stevens had won the George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award in 1996.

Jockeys killed while racing"," George Woolf (born Goldie Woolf; January 21, 1898 – February 10, 1946) was an American Hall of Fame jockey. Born in San Francisco, California, Woolf was Jewish. His parents were Louis and Anna (Drezner) Woolf. He had two older brothers, Sam and Phil, and a younger sister, Frances. The family lived at 1204 O'Farrell Street in San Francisco, close to the old Civic Center, where the family's relatives, the Mayberg family, owned a clothing store. Woolf attended the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, on a football scholarship, where he was a teammate of future General Dwight D. Eisenhower. However, he injured his knee and was unable to continue with the sport. Woolf then began his career as a jockey in 1918. He won his first race at the age of 20 at the Oakland Race Course in Oakland, California. In 1922 he was one of the first jockeys to ride a winner at Santa Anita Park, in Arcadia, California. He was the leading jockey at the park that year. In 1923 he was the leading jockey at Del Mar Racetrack in Del Mar, California. Woolf was the jockey of the future Hall of Fame inductee Sir Barton when he won the first American Triple Crown in 1919. He also rode on two other Triple Crown winners, Sir Beldon and Morvich. Woolf won the Kentucky Derby in 1925 and 1926. He also won the Preakness Stakes in 1925 and the Belmont Stakes in 1926. In addition, Woolf won the Travers Stakes four times, the Wilson Stakes, the Continental Turf Handicap, the Chicago Derby, the Washington Park Derby, and the Oak Park Derby. Woolf was the regular rider of the Hall of Fame inductee Zev, on whom he won the 1927 Hollywood Gold Cup. Woolf died in a plane crash on February 10, 1946, in Berkeley, California.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Signagi"", the article should at least have 250 words","Signagi or Sighnaghi () is a town in Georgia's easternmost region of Kakheti and the administrative center of the Signagi Municipality. Although it is one of Georgia's smallest towns, Signagi serves as a popular tourist destination due to its location at the heart of Georgia's wine-growing regions, as well as its picturesque landscapes, pastel houses and narrow, cobblestone streets. Located on a steep hill, Signagi overlooks the vast Alazani Valley, with the Caucasus Mountains visible at a distance.

Etymology 
The name of the town comes from Old Turkic word of  (, ), meaning ""shelter"" or ""asylum"".

History 
Signagi is located in the Kakheti region of Georgia, first settled in the Paleolithic period. Throughout its history, Signagi or Sighnaghi was known to the local population as Kambechovani, and later as Kisikhi or Kisiki. The word Sighnaghi in the Turkic language means shelter or trench. Signagi as a settlement was first recorded in the early 18th century. In 1762, King Heraclius II of Georgia sponsored the construction of the town and erected a fortress to defend the area from marauding attacks by Dagestani tribesmen.

According to the 1770 census, 100 families, chiefly craftsmen and merchants, lived in Signagi. When Georgia was annexed by Imperial Russia in 1801, Signagi (Signakh) was officially granted town status and became a center of the Signakh uyezd () within the Tiflis Governorate in 1802. In 1812, Signakh joined the rebellion with the rest of Kakheti against Russian rule. During the Caucasian War, the town ""was considered an important point on account of its proximity to"" Dagestan.

The town quickly grew in size and population and became an agricultural center in the Soviet Union. The severe economic crisis in post-Soviet Georgia heavily affected the town, but a major reconstruction project recently launched by the Government of Georgia and co-funded by several international organizations intends to both address an increasing tourist interest and modernize infrastructure.

Geography and Climate 
The town has an area of 2.978 ha with 24.3% being residential. Signagi is approximately 113 km southeast of Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia. Signagi District is adjacent, on the town’s east and southwest sides. Signagi is situated in the eastern foothills of the Gombori Range, a watershed between the Iori and Alazani valleys, in a productive agricultural and fruit-growing region. At an elevation of about 790 m above sea level, the town overlooks the Alazani Valley and faces the Greater Caucasus mountains.

Signagi has a mild Mediterranean-like climate. There are four seasons, with winters being moderately cold while summers can be hot. The highest average temperature is in July at 24.3°C while the lowest average temperature is in January at 0.2°C. Average annual precipitation ranges from 602.1 to 949.7 mm, with the heaviest occurring during the spring months and early summer.

Culture and Attractions 
Signagi and its environs are home to several historical and cultural monuments and have been specifically protected by the State since 1975. The town is walled with the remnants of 18th-century fortifications. There are two Georgian Orthodox churches in the town itself - one dedicated to St. George and the other to St. Stephen. The venerated Bodbe Monastery is located 2 kilometers from Signagi and is a place of pilgrimage due to its association with St. Nino, the 4th-century apostle of Georgia.

The local Ethnographic and Archaeological Museum dating from the 1950s was upgraded and developed into a modern-standard exhibition the – Signagi Museum – in 2007. Signagi is known as the ""City of Love"" in Georgia, with many couples visiting it just to get married.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Turkish Cypriots"", the article should at least have 250 words","Turkish Cypriots or Cypriot Turks ( or Kıbrıslı Türkler; ) are mostly ethnic Turks originating from Cyprus. Following the Ottoman conquest of the island in 1571, about 30,000 Turkish settlers were given land once they arrived in Cyprus. Additionally, many of the island's local Christians converted to Islam during the early years of Ottoman rule. Nonetheless, the influx of mainly Muslim settlers to Cyprus continued intermittently until the end of the Ottoman period. Today, while Northern Cyprus is home to a significant part of the Turkish Cypriot population, the majority of Turkish Cypriots live abroad, forming the Turkish Cypriot diaspora. This diaspora came into existence after the Ottoman Empire transferred the control of the island to the British Empire, as many Turkish Cypriots emigrated primarily to Turkey and the United Kingdom for political and economic reasons. 

Standard Turkish is the official language of Northern Cyprus. The vernacular spoken by Turkish Cypriots is Cypriot Turkish, which has been influenced by Cypriot Greek as well as English.

History

Pre-Ottoman Cyprus
Although there was no settled Muslim population in Cyprus prior to the Ottoman conquest of 1570–71, some Ottoman Turks were captured and 
carried off as prisoners to Cyprus in the year 1400 during Cypriot raids in the Asiatic and Egyptian coasts. Some of these captives accepted or were forced to convert to Christianity and were baptized; however, there were also some Turkish slaves who remained unbaptized. By 1425, some of these slaves helped the Mamluke army to gain access to Limassol Castle. Despite the release of some of the captives, after the payment of ransoms, most of the baptized Turks continued to remain on the island. The medieval Cypriot historian Leontios Machairas recalled that the baptized Turks were not permitted to leave Nicosia when the Mamlukes approached the city after the battle of Khirokitia in 1426. According to Professor Charles Fraser Beckingham, ""there must therefore have been some Cypriots, at least nominally Christian, who were of Turkish, Arab, or Egyptian origin.""

By 1488, the Ottomans made their first attempt at conquering Cyprus when Sultan Bayezid II sent a fleet to conquer Famagusta. However, the attempt failed due to the timely intervention of a Venetian fleet. The Queen of Cyprus, Caterina Cornaro, was forced to relinquish her crown to the Republic of Venice in 1489. In the same year, Ottoman ships were seen off the coast of Karpas and the Venetians began to strengthen the fortifications of the island. By 1500, coastal raids by Ottoman vessels resulted in the heavy loss of Venetian fleets, forcing Venice to negotiate a peace treaty with the Ottoman Empire in 1503. However, by May 1539 Suleiman I decided to attack Limassol because the Venetians had been sheltering pirates who continuously attacked Ottoman ships. Limassol stayed under Ottoman control until a peace treaty was signed in 1540. Cyprus continued to be a haven for pirates who interrupted the safe passage of Ottoman trade ships and Muslim pilgrims sailing to Mecca and Medina. By 1569, pirates captured the Ottoman defterdar (treasurer) of Egypt, and Selim II decided to safeguard the sea route from Constantinople to Alexandria by conquering the island and clearing the eastern Mediterranean of all enemies in 1570–71.

Ottoman Cyprus

The basis for the emergence of a sizeable and enduring Turkish community in Cyprus emerged when Ottoman troops landed on the island in mid-May 1570 and seized it within a year from Venetian rule. The post-conquest period established a significant Muslim community which consisted of soldiers from the campaign who remained behind and further settlers who were brought from Anatolia as part of a traditional Ottoman population policy. There were also new converts to Islam on the island during the early years of Ottoman rule.

In addition to documented settlement of Anatolian peasants and craftsmen, as well as the arrival of soldiers, decrees were also issued banishing Anatolian tribes, ""undesirable"" persons, and members of various ""troublesome"" Muslim sects, principally those officially classified as heretical. This influx of mainly Muslim settlers to Cyprus continued intermittently until the end of the Ottoman period.

Some Turkish Cypriots are descendants of Crypto-Christians, a phenomenon that was not uncommon in the Ottoman Empire given its multi-faith character. In Cyprus, many Latins and Maronites, as well as Greeks, converted to Islam at different points during Ottoman rule for a number of reasons ranging from collectively avoiding heavy taxation to ending an individual woman unhappy marriage. Their artificial embrace of Islam and their secret maintaining of Christianity led this group of crypto-Christians to be known in Greek as 'Linobamvaki' or the cotton-linen sect as they changed religion to curry favour with Ottoman officials during the day but practiced Catholicism at night. In 1636 the conditions for the Christians became intolerable and certain Christians decided to become Muslims. According to Palmieri (1905) the Maronites who became Muslims lived mainly in the Nicosia District and despite the fact that the Maronites turned to Muslims they never gave up their Christian faith and beliefs hoping to become Christians. This is why they baptized their children according to the Christian faith, but they also practiced circumcision. They also gave their children two names, a Muslim and a Christian one. Many of the villages and neighbouring areas accepted as Turkish Cypriot estates, were formerly Linobambaki activity centers. These include:

By the second quarter of the nineteenth century, approximately 30,000 Muslims were living in Cyprus, comprising about 35% of the total population. The fact that Turkish was the main language spoken by the Muslims of the island is a significant indicator that the majority of them were either Turkish-speaking Anatolians or otherwise from a Turkic background. Throughout the Ottoman rule, the demographic ratio between Christian ""Greeks"" and Muslim ""Turks"" fluctuated constantly. During 1745–1814, the Muslim Turkish Cypriots constituted the majority on the island compared to the Christian Greek Cypriots, being up to 75% of the total island population. However, by 1841, Turks made up 27% of the island's population. One of the reasons for this decline is because the Turkish community were obliged to serve in the Ottoman army for years, usually away from home, very often losing their lives in the endless wars of the Ottoman Empire. Another reason for the declining population was because of the emigration trend of some 15,000 Turkish Cypriots to Anatolia in 1878, when the Ottoman Turks handed over the administration of the island to Britain.

British Cyprus

By 1878, during the Congress of Berlin, under the terms of the Anglo-Ottoman Cyprus Convention, the Ottoman Turks had agreed to assign Cyprus to Britain to occupy and rule, though not to possess as sovereign territory. According to the first British census of Cyprus, in 1881, 95% of the island's Muslims spoke Turkish as their mother tongue. As of the 1920s, the percentage of Greek-speaking Muslims had dropped from 5%, in 1881, to just under 2% of the total Muslim population. During the opening years of the twentieth century Ottomanism became an ever more popular identity held by the Cypriot Muslim intelligentsia, especially in the wake of the Young Turk Revolution of 1908. Increasing numbers of Young Turks who had turned against Sultan Abdul Hamid II sought refuge in Cyprus. A rising class of disgruntled intellectuals in the island's main urban centres gradually began to warm to the ideas of positivism, freedom and modernization. Spurred on by the rising calls for ""enosis"", the union with Greece, emanating from Greek Cypriots, an initially hesitant ""Turkism"" was also starting to appear in certain newspaper articles and to be heard in the political debates of the local intelligentsia of Cyprus. In line with the changes introduced in the Ottoman Empire after 1908, the curricula of Cyprus's Muslim schools, such as the ""Idadi"", were also altered to incorporate more secular teachings with increasingly Turkish nationalist undertones. Many of these graduates in due course ended up as teachers in the growing number of urban and rural schools that had begun to proliferate across the island by the 1920s.

In 1914 the Ottoman Empire joined the First World War against the Allied Forces and Britain annexed the island. Cyprus's Muslim inhabitants were officially asked to choose between adopting either British nationality or retaining their Ottoman subject status; about 4,000–8,500 Muslims decided to leave the island and move to Turkey. Following its defeat in World War I, the Ottoman Empire were faced with the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922) whereby the Greek incursion into Anatolia aimed at claiming what Greece believed to be historically Greek territory. For the Ottoman Turks of Cyprus, already fearing the aims of enosis-seeking Greek Cypriots, reports of atrocities committed by the Greeks against the Turkish populations in Anatolia, and the Greek Occupation of Smyrna, produced further fears for their own future. Greek forces were routed in 1922 under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk who, in 1923, proclaimed the new Republic of Turkey and renounced irredentist claims to former Ottoman territories beyond the Anatolian heartland. Muslims in Cyprus were thus excluded from the nation-building project, though many still heeded Atatürk's call to join in the establishment of the new nation-state, and opted for Turkish citizenship. Between 1881 and 1927 approximately 30,000 Turkish Cypriots emigrated to Turkey.

The 1920s was to prove a critical decade in terms of stricter ethno-religious compartments; hence, Muslim Cypriots who remained on the island gradually embraced the ideology of Turkish nationalism due to the impact of the Kemalist Revolution. At its core were the Kemalist values of secularism, modernization and westernization; reforms such as the introduction of the new Turkish alphabet, adoption of western dress and secularization, were adopted voluntarily by Muslim Turkish Cypriots, who had been prepared for such changes not just by the Tanzimat but also by several decades of British rule. Many of those Cypriots who until then had still identified themselves primarily as Muslims began now to see themselves principally as Turks in Cyprus.

By 1950, a Cypriot Enosis referendum in which 95.7% of Greek Cypriot voters supported a fight aimed at enosis, the union of Cyprus with Greece were led by an armed organisation, in 1955, called EOKA by Georgios Grivas which aimed at bringing down British rule and uniting the island of Cyprus with Greece. Turkish Cypriots had always reacted immediately against the objective of enosis; thus, the 1950s saw many Turkish Cypriots who were forced to flee from their homes. In 1958, Turkish Cypriots set up their own armed group called Turkish Resistance Organisation (TMT) and by early 1958, the first wave of armed conflict between the two communities began; a few hundred Turkish Cypriots left their villages and quarters in the mixed towns and never returned.

Republic of Cyprus

By 16 August 1960 the island of Cyprus became an independent state, the Republic of Cyprus, with power sharing between the two communities under the 1960 Zurich agreements, with Britain, Greece and Turkey as Guarantor Powers. Archbishop Makarios III was elected as president by the Greek Cypriots and Dr. Fazıl Küçük was elected as vice-president by the Turkish Cypriots. However, in December 1963, in the events known as ""Bloody Christmas"", when Makarios III attempted to modify the Constitution, Greek Cypriots initiated a military campaign against the Turkish Cypriots and began to attack Turkish inhabited villages; by early 1964, the Turkish Cypriots started to withdraw into armed enclaves where the Greek Cypriots blockaded them, resulting in some 25,000 Turkish Cypriots becoming refugees, or internally ""displaced persons"". This resulted in the UN peacekeeping force, UNFICYP, being stationed on the island as well as an external migration trend of thousands more Turkish Cypriots to the United Kingdom, Turkey, North America and Australia. With the rise to power of the Greek military junta, a decade later, in 1974, a group of right-wing Greek nationalists, EOKA B, who supported the union of Cyprus with Greece, launched a putsch. This action precipitated the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, which led to the capture of the present-day territory of Northern Cyprus the following month, after a ceasefire collapsed. The Turkish invasion resulted in the occupation of some 37% of the island in the north. After the Turkish invasion and the ensuing 1975 Vienna agreements, 60,000 Turkish Cypriots who lived in the south of the island fled to the north. The 1974–1975 movement was strictly organised by the Provisional Turkish Administration who tried to preserve village communities intact.

Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus

In 1983 the Turkish Cypriots declared their own state in the north, the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, which remains internationally unrecognised, except by Turkey. In 2004, a referendum for the unification of the island, the ""Annan Plan"", was accepted by 65% of Turkish Cypriots but rejected by 76% of Greek Cypriots.

Culture

The Turkish Cypriots are Turkish-speaking, regard themselves as secular Muslims, and take pride in their Ottoman heritage. However, Turkish Cypriots differentiate themselves from mainlanders, especially from the religiously conservative settlers who have come to Cyprus more recently, but their strong connection to Turkey is nonetheless undisputed. Hence, the Turkish Cypriot identity is based on their ethnic Turkish roots and links to mainland Turkey, but also to their Cypriot character with cultural and linguistic similarities with Greek Cypriots. Their culture is heavily based on family ties linked to parents, siblings, and relatives; one's neighbourhood is also considered important as emphasis is given on helping those in need. Thus, much of their lives revolves around social activities, and food is a central feature of gatherings. Turkish Cypriot folk dances, music, and art are also integral parts of their culture.

Religion

The majority of Turkish Cypriots (99%) are Sunni Muslims. However, the secularizing force of Kemalism has also exerted an impact on Turkish Cypriots. Religious practices are considered a matter of individual choice and many do not actively practice their religion. Alcohol is frequently consumed within the community and most Turkish Cypriot women do not cover their heads. Turkish Cypriot males are generally circumcised at a young age in accordance with religious beliefs, although, this practice appears more related to custom and tradition than to powerful religious motivation.

The social/religious phenomenon of crypto-Christianity was observed in Cyprus, as in other parts of the Ottoman Empire. The crypto-Christians of Cyprus were known as Linobambaki (= of linen and cotton). They are mentioned by foreign travellers as Turks who are secretly Greeks, observing the Greek Orthodox fasting (Turner 1815), drinking wine, eating pork and often taking Christian wives.

Language

The Turkish language was introduced to Cyprus with the Ottoman conquest in 1571 and became the politically dominant, prestigious language, of the administration. In the post-Ottoman period, Cypriot Turkish was relatively isolated from standard Turkish and had strong influences by the Cypriot Greek dialect. The condition of coexistence with the Greek Cypriots led to a certain bilingualism whereby Turkish Cypriots' knowledge of Greek was important in areas where the two communities lived and worked together.

According to Prof. C. F. Beckingham (1957), in Cyprus religious and linguistic divisions do not always coincide. There were ""Turkish"", i.e. Muslim villages in which the normal language was Greek. Among them were Lapithiou, Platanisto, Ayios Simeon Beckingham said that this phenomenon has not been adequately investigated.{{sfn|Beckingham|1957|p=166|ps=:In Cyprus religious and linguistic divisions do not quite coincide. While many Turks habitually speak Turkish there are 'Turkish', that is, Muslim villages in which the normal language is Greek; among them are Lapithiou (P i), Platanisso (F i), Ayios Simeon (F i) and Galinoporni (F i). This fact has not yet been adequately investigated. With the growth of national feeling and the spread of education, the phenomenon is becoming not only rarer but harder to detect. In a Muslim village the school teacher will be a Turk and will teach the children Turkish. They already think of themselves as Turks, and having once learnt the language, will sometimes use it in talking to a visitor in preference to Greek, merely as a matter of national pride. On the other hand, many Turks, whose mother tongue is Turkish, learn Greek because they find it useful to understand the language of the majority, though it is much less common for them to write it correctly}} The existence of Greek-speaking Muslims is also mentioned in subsequent works. Ozan Gülle (2014), ""it is historically well documented that Turkish Cypriots showed large differences in their frequency of communication in Cypriot Greek [...]: On one end of the spectrum are Turkish Cypriots who were probably monolingual Cypriot Greek speakers or had only little competency in Turkish, ..."".

The linguistic situation changed radically in 1974, following the division of Cyprus into a Greek south and a Turkish north. Today, the Cypriot Turkish dialect is being exposed to increasing standard Turkish through immigration from Turkey, new mass media, and new educational institutions. Nonetheless, a Turkish speaker familiar with the Cypriot Turkish variety of Turkish can still easily identify a member of the community from one who is not. Although many Turkish Cypriots command standard Turkish as well, they generally choose to use their own variety in particular contexts to affirm their identity. Most commonly, these differences are in pronunciation, but they extend to lexicon and grammatical structures as well. There are many words used by Turkish Cypriots that originate in the particular historical circumstances of the island, including English and Greek, and therefore have no precedent in standard Turkish. There are also words used by the Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot communities which are authentically Cypriot in origin.

Music and dances

Folk music and dancing is an integral part of social life among Turkish Cypriots. Traditional Turkish Cypriot folk dances can be divided into five categories: Karsilamas, Sirtos, Zeybeks, Ciftetellis/Arabiyes, and Topical Dances (such as Orak, Kozan, Kartal and Topal). The folk dancing groups usually have performances during national festivals, weddings, Turkish nights at hotels and within tourism areas.

Demographics

Debates on the Turkish Cypriot population in the 1970s
The 1960 census of Cyprus reported the Turkish Cypriot population as 18% of the total population. The figure was challenged at in a 1978 debate in the British Parliament when Lord Spens stated that there were 400,000 Turkish Cypriots in Cyprus, at least one-fifth of the population.

2006 Census
According to the 2006 Northern Cyprus Census, there were 145,443 Turkish Cypriots born on the island who were resident in Northern Cyprus (TRNC). Of the Cypriot-born population, 120,007 had both parents born in Cyprus; 12,628 had one of their parents born in Cyprus and the other born in another country. Thus, 132,635 Turkish Cypriots had at least one parent born in Cyprus.

2011 Census
According to the 2011 Northern Cyprus Census, there were 160,207 Turkish Cypriots born on the island who were resident in North Cyprus (TRNC).

Diaspora

There was significant Turkish Cypriot emigration from the island during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, mainly to Great Britain, Australia, and Turkey. Emigration from Cyprus has mainly been for economical and political reasons. According to the TRNC Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in 2001, 500,000 Turkish Cypriots were living in Turkey; 200,000 in Great Britain; 40,000 in Australia; some 10,000 in North America; and 5,000 in other countries.

A more recent estimate, in 2011, by the Home Affairs Committee states that there are now 300,000 Turkish Cypriots living in the United Kingdom though Turkish Cypriots themselves claim that the British-Turkish Cypriot community has reached 400,000. Furthermore, recent estimates suggest that there are between 60,000 and 120,000 Turkish Cypriots living in Australia, 5,000 in the United States, 2,000 in Germany, 1,800 in Canada, 1,600 in New Zealand, and a smaller community in South Africa.

Turkey

The first mass migration of Turkish Cypriots to Turkey occurred in 1878 when the Ottoman Empire leased Cyprus to Great Britain. The flow of Turkish Cypriot emigration to Turkey continued in the aftermath of the First World War, and gained its greatest velocity in the mid-1920s. Economic motives played an important part of the continued migration to Turkey because conditions for the poor in Cyprus during the 1920s were especially harsh. Thereafter, Turkish Cypriots continued to migrate to Turkey during the Second World War in the 1940s and during the Cyprus conflict of the 1960s and 1970s.

Initially, enthusiasm to emigrate to Turkey was inflated by the euphoria that greeted the birth of the newly established Republic of Turkey and later of promises of assistance to Turks who emigrated. A decision taken by the Turkish Government at the end of 1925, for instance, noted that the Turks of Cyprus had, according to the Treaty of Lausanne, the right to emigrate to the republic, and therefore, families that so emigrated would be given a house and sufficient land. The precise number of those who emigrated to Turkey is a matter that remains unknown. The press in Turkey reported in mid-1927 that of those who had opted for Turkish nationality, 5,000–6,000 Turkish Cypriots had already settled in Turkey. However, many Turkish Cypriots had already emigrated even before the rights accorded to them under the Treaty of Lausanne had come into force.

Metin Heper and Bilge Criss have summarized the migration of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century as follows:

St. John-Jones has analyzed the migration of Turkish Cypriots during early British rule further:

The Turkish Cypriot population in Turkey continued to increase at fluctuating speeds as a result of the Second World War (1939–1945). According to Ali Suat Bilge, taking into consideration the mass migrations of 1878, the First World War, the 1920s early Turkish Republican era, and the Second World War, overall, a total of approximately 100,000 Turkish Cypriots had left the island for Turkey between 1878 and 1945. By 31 August 1955, a statement by Turkey's Minister of State and Acting Foreign Minister, Fatin Rüştü Zorlu, at the London Conference on Cyprus, estimated that the total Turkish Cypriot population (including descendants) in Turkey had reached 300,000: 

By 2001 the TRNC Ministry of Foreign Affairs estimated that 500,000 Turkish Cypriots were living in Turkey.

Palestine
Turkish Cypriots who remained in Cyprus during the early twentieth century were faced with the harsh economic conditions of the Great Depression under British rule. Consequently, many families in the poorest villages, facing debt and starvation, married off their daughters to Arabs mainly in British Palestine, and other Arab countries, in the hope that they would have a better life. A bride price was normally given by the groom to the family of the girls, usually about £10-20, enough to buy several acres of land at the time, as part of the marriage arrangements.. Such payments had not been part of Cypriot tradition, and Cypriots typically describe the girls in these forced marriages as having been ""sold""; Arabs however, often object to this characterization. Mostly between the ages of 11–18, the majority of the girls lost contact with their families in Cyprus, and while some had successful marriages and families, others found themselves little more than domestic servants, abused, or ended up working in brothels.

The marriages were sometimes arranged by brokers, who presented the prospective husbands as wealthy doctors and engineers. However, Neriman Cahit, in her book Brides for Sale, found that in reality many of these men had mediocre jobs or were already married with children. Unaware of these realities, Turkish Cypriot families continued to send their daughters to Palestine until the 1950s. Cahit estimates that within 30 years up to 4,000 Turkish Cypriot women were sent to Palestine to be married to Arab men.

In recent years second and third generation Palestinians of Turkish Cypriot origin have been applying for Cypriot citizenship; several hundred Palestinians have already been successful in obtaining Cypriot passports.

In 2012 Yeliz Shukri and Stavros Papageorghiou secured financial support for the making of a film on the subject of the ""Forgotten Brides"". The documentary, entitled Missing Fetine, was released in 2018, and follows the search of Australian-born Turkish Cypriot Pembe Mentesh for her long-lost great-aunt, while investigating the fate of these Turkish Cypriot women.

United Kingdom

Turkish Cypriot migration to the United Kingdom began in the early 1920s, the British Empire having formally annexed Cyprus in 1914, with the residents of British-ruled Cyprus becoming subjects of the Crown. Some arrived as students and tourists, while others left the island due to the harsh economic and political life during the British colony of Cyprus. Emigration to the United Kingdom continued to increase when the Great Depression of 1929 brought economic depression to Cyprus, with unemployment and low wages being a significant issue. During the Second World War, the number of Turkish run cafes increased from 20 in 1939 to 200 in 1945 which created a demand for more Turkish Cypriot workers. Throughout the 1950s, Turkish Cypriots emigrated for economic reasons and by 1958 their number was estimated to be 8,500. Their numbers continued to increase each year as rumours about immigration restrictions appeared in much of the Cypriot media.

The 1950s also saw the arrival of many Turkish Cypriots to the United Kingdom due to political reasons; many began to flee as a result of the EOKA struggle and its aim of ""enosis"". Once the ethnic cleansing broke out in 1963, and some 25,000 Turkish Cypriots became internally displaced, accounting to about a fifth of their population. The political and economic unrest in Cyprus, after 1964, sharply increased the number of Turkish Cypriot immigrants to the United Kingdom. Many of these early migrants worked in the clothing industry in London, where both men and women could work together; many worked in the textile industry as sewing was a skill which the community had already acquired in Cyprus. Turkish Cypriots were concentrated mainly in the north-east of London and specialised in the heavy-wear sector, such as coats and tailored garments. This sector offered work opportunities where poor knowledge of the English language was not a problem and where self-employment was a possibility.

Once the Turkish Cypriots declared their own state, the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, the division of the island led to an economic embargo against the Turkish Cypriots by the Greek Cypriot controlled Republic of Cyprus. This had the effect of depriving the Turkish Cypriots of foreign investment, aid and export markets; thus, it caused the Turkish Cypriot economy to remain stagnant and undeveloped. Due to these economic and political issues, an estimated 130,000 Turkish Cypriots have emigrated from Northern Cyprus since its establishment to the United Kingdom.

Genetic studies
According to genetic studies, there are close connections between modern Anatolian and Cypriot populations. A 2016 study, which focused on patrilineal ancestry, found that among the sampled Near Eastern and Southeastern European populations, Turkish Cypriots had the shortest genetic distances with those from Cyprus, Turkey, Lebanon, Greece, and Sicily.

A 2017 study found that both Turkish Cypriots' and Greek Cypriots' patrilineal ancestry derives primarily from a single pre-Ottoman local gene pool. The frequency of total haplotypes shared between Turkish and Greek Cypriots is 7-8%, with analysis showing that none of these are found in Turkey, thus not supporting a Turkish origin for the shared haplotypes. No shared haplotypes were observed between Greek Cypriots and mainland Turkish populations, while total haplotypes shared between Turkish Cypriots and mainland Turks is 3%. Turkish Cypriots also share haplotypes with North Africans to a lesser extent, and have Eastern Eurasian haplogroups (H, C, N, O, Q) – attributed to the arrival of the Ottomans – at a frequency of ~5.5%. Both Cypriot groups show close genetic affinity to Calabrian (southern Italy) and Lebanese patrilineages. The study states that the genetic affinity between Calabrians and Cypriots can be explained as a result of a common ancient Greek (Achaean) genetic contribution, while Lebanese affinity can be explained through several migrations that took place from coastal Levant to Cyprus from the Neolithic (early farmers), the Iron Age (Phoenicians), and the Middle Ages (Maronites and other Levantine settlers during the Frankish era). The predominant haplogroups among both Turkish and Greek Cypriots are J2a-M410, E-M78, and G2-P287.

In a 2019 genome-wide study, Cypriot samples grouped with people from the Levant (Druze, Lebanese and Syrians) and Armenia among the sampled populations from Eurasia and Africa, using cluster analysis based on haplotype-sharing patterns.

Homozygous beta thalassemia in a number of at-risk populations (Greek and Turkish Cypriots, Greeks, Continental Italians and Sardinians) has been prevented at the population level by programmes based on carrier screening, genetic counselling and prenatal diagnosis.

Turkish
Cypriots
Muslim communities in Europe"," Turkish Cypriots are mostly ethnic Turks who live in Cyprus. A distinctive Turkish-Cypriot identity was formed as a result of cultural and economic isolation from the rest of Cyprus, and the resentment that accompanied it. In the 1960s, the Turkish Cypriots' political movement for protection of their interests, which they called ""Türk Kuşu"", was influenced by the movement for the protection of the interests of Turkish workers in Germany, called ""Türkischer Kulturverband"". Turkish Cypriots are generally from the Turkish-speaking minority of Cyprus. They are mostly located in the north of the island, in the self-proclaimed Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, although there is a small Turkish-speaking minority in the south of the island, in the Greek-speaking Republic of Cyprus. The Turkish-Cypriot community is often considered to be made up of three distinct groups of Turkish-Cypriots: the ""old-Cypriots"" ( Cypriot Turks or Kıbrıslı Turks), the ""new-Cypriots"" ( Turkish-Cypriots or Türk Cüzlu), and the ""Kurdish-Cypriots"" (Kurmançı). Old-Cypriots are the descendants of the first Turks to settle in Cyprus, some of whom intermarried with local Greek Cypriots. They speak a dialect of Turkish that contains many Greek words and phrases, and a small number of them also speak Greek. In the past, they were mostly farmers, but today many of them are shopkeepers or workers in the tourism industry. New-Cypriots are the descendants of Turks who arrived in Cyprus during the British colonial period, most of whom did not intermarry with local Greek Cypriots. They speak a dialect of Turkish that is closer to the standard Turkish spoken in Turkey, and they do not generally speak Greek. In the past, they were mostly workers in the British military bases or in the tourism industry, but today many of them are farmers or workers in the construction industry. Kurdish-Cypriots are the descendants of Turks who arrived in Cyprus from Turkey's Kurdish-majority regions, such as Şanlıurfa and Mardin. They speak a dialect of Turkish that is heavily influenced by Kurdish, and they do not generally speak Greek. In the past, they were mostly farmers, but today many of them are shopkeepers or workers in the tourism industry. The population of Turkish Cypriots is not known with certainty. In the south of the island, the Republic of Cyprus does not recognise the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, and as a result, the Turkish Cypriots living in the south are not included in the census conducted by the Republic of Cyprus. The population of Turkish Cypriots in the south is estimated to be between 200,000 and 500,000. The Turkish Cypriots in the north of the island are recognised as citizens of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. The population of Turkish Cypriots in the north is estimated to be between 200,000 and 300,000.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,934562,0.13790806129247168,0.17894736842105263,0.2840879004500927,0.46417445482866043,18,26,0,0,11,1,1,1,0,1,0.19291299223402633,0.03486383852759335,0.012565589616128142,0.038083538083538086,93,0,60,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,38,1,70,1,1,1
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Tracy Jordan"", the article should at least have 250 words","Tracy Jordan is a fictional character in the American television series 30 Rock, played by the actor Tracy Morgan. The character is a movie star whose personality traits and life events are taken from Morgan's own life. In 2010, Entertainment Weekly ranked him the 55th Greatest Character of the Last 20 Years.

For his portrayal of Jordan, Tracy Morgan has received one Primetime Emmy Award nomination, two Image Awards nominations, and seven Screen Actors Guild Award nominations, winning one.

Concept
Tracy Jordan is a rich, famous B-list movie star with a reputation for unpredictable behavior. At the time newly installed NBC executive Jack Donaghy forces writer Liz Lemon to hire Jordan as the new star of her sketch comedy program The Girlie Show in the pilot episode of the series, Jordan was in a career slump, having made no new movies for two years. Upon hiring Tracy, Jack renames the show TGS with Tracy Jordan, much to the chagrin of Liz. Throughout the series, Jordan enjoys renewed success through his starring TGS role and other performances and ventures.

Character history
Jordan is a descendant of Thomas Jefferson and slave Sally Hemings. Jordan was born in Yankee Stadium but the exact date is unknown as he has no birth certificate. He was given the honorary birthday of February 24, shared with TGS Co-star Jenna Maroney in the March 5, 2009 episode ""Goodbye, My Friend"". Tracy grew up in a tough neighborhood in The Bronx called ‘Knuckle Beach’, though many of his claims about it sound fictitious.
As a child, Jordan was a cast member on the Nickelodeon show Ray Ray's Mystery Garage. He also claims to have attended middle school in an Exxon station. He lived with his single mother in 1979, dropped out of Frank Lucas High School over his inability to dissect a frog, and claims to have spent time busking as a bucket drummer. He was discovered after doing stand-up at the Apollo in 1984.
Jordan did a Christmas album in 1998 and is a big fan of Pat Benatar. In addition to his acting career, he writes a column in Ebony Magazine called ""Musings"". He owns several houses but got into debt because he didn't make the payments on them.

Character traits
Jordan is a self-centered prima donna. For instance, in ""Operation Righteous Cowboy Lightning"", Tracy says, ""Perfection is my middle name. 'Unclaimed Perfection Baby Boy'."" He aspires to own an island.
Jordan is treated for a mental health disorder by Dr. Leo Spaceman, a doctor of questionable integrity and qualification, who describes Tracy's problems as ""erratic tendencies and delusions brought on by excessive notoriety and certainly not helped by my (Spaceman's) highly experimental treatments."" He is unable to perform a scene the same way twice (""Future Husband""), making his employ as an actor difficult. Jordan is also a conspiracy theorist who believes, for instance, in shadow organizations and vampires. 
Despite all this, the character is supposed to be generally well-meaning and more intelligent than he appears. He periodically surprises his coworkers with his knowledge of proper grammar (for example, telling Toofer in ""The Aftermath"" that ""Superman does good, you're doing well"") and advanced vocabulary, though these vignettes are often played for comedy. He is able to remember details of American history and is able to answer trivia questions correctly. He also has a sensitivity to the mistreatment of African Americans. Tracy has an interest in American Revolutionary history, which he studied after learning of his relation to Thomas Jefferson, attempting to produce and star in a Jefferson biopic. In ""Corporate Crush"", while struggling to secure funding for his film, he tells Liz ""You're my Alexander Hamilton!"" In ""Winter Madness"" he argues with several Freedom Trail historical reenactors in Boston for misrepresenting the racism of the Founding Fathers and the date of Crispus Attucks' death.

Jordan often implies that his clownish behavior is mostly an act, which he maintains because his childish persona is responsible for his success as an entertainer. This seems to be supported by Jordan's occasional moments of maturity, such as when he behaves professionally for an entire week in ""The Natural Order"" to prove to Liz Lemon that he is capable of acting like an adult. However, he soon reverts to his old personality, admitting he is more comfortable being immature.

Relationships

Family
Tracy and his wife Angie have been married since 1991. They like to roleplay, including 'playing rape', when he wears a ski mask. Jordan often walks around his house naked to show his oldest male child ""who got the biggest ding-dong"".
With Angie, Tracy has two sons, named Tracy Jordan Jr. and George Foreman Jordan (played by Dante E. Clark), and a daughter, Virginia, who is born during season 5. Tracy also has a self-styled illegitimate son named Donald (played by Michael Benjamin Washington), an entrepreneur whom Tracy supports financially despite knowing that he is not actually his son; Donald is two years older than Tracy.

Although he ""parties with women to keep up his rap credentials,"" Tracy maintains loyalty to his wife, admitting to Jack Donaghy in ""The Ones"" that he has never cheated on her. Because his womanizing persona is integral to his success as an entertainer, Tracy's career takes a downturn in ""Don Geiss, America, and Hope"" when his monogamy becomes known to the public, in a reverse parody of the Tiger Woods infidelity scandal of 2009.

Tracy spent most of his childhood in foster care. He once lived with his birth mother, but lost touch with her: in ""The Moms"" he is not sure of her whereabouts or even her name. Tracy's biological father is unknown; Tracy presumes him dead since he has never come forward to ask Tracy for money. In ""Nothing Left to Lose,"" Tracy shares memories of a father who abandoned him for a second family in Ohio (going on to have a daughter who is also named Tracy), but the effect of this upon the show's continuity is unclear.

With Liz
Tracy refers to Liz by either her last name or her full name, for example, ""Too late, Liz Lemon!"" Jordan treats Liz with contempt and mimics her. However, in later seasons he begins calling her ""LL"", following a trend of often calling characters by their initials.

With his entourage and friends
Jordan tends to loiter around the studio with his entourage, former high school classmate Grizz and professional entourage member Dot Com.  Jordan develops a close friendship with NBC page Kenneth Parcell, who willingly runs errands for him and periodically serves as a member of his entourage.  Kenneth often puts himself in harm's way to help Jordan.  Jordan helps Kenneth with his shyness around women, and considers himself a mentor to Kenneth.  He is more sympathetic to Kenneth than most of the other characters are.  For example, when Tracy quit TGS after learning he no longer needed the money he earned from the show, it was Jack's threat to fire Kenneth that made Tracy change his mind, returning to the show in order to keep Kenneth employed (""The Bubble"").  Kenneth acted as an asexual, de facto, on-set wife to Jordan during his brief estrangement from Angie (Season 2).

With Jenna
Jordan and Jenna often disagree. For instance, whether it is more difficult to be a black man or a white woman in America (""Believe in the Stars""). However, they have some friendly moments at times and become closer, assuming they are both ""special people"".  There is also an increasing occurrence of the two being involved in shenanigans together.

Jordan's life

Career
Jordan has a reputation for being uncontrollable and his habit of insulting powerful movie executives costs him roles. However, Jordan's engagements are many and varied.

Politics
Jordan is not overly interested in politics. Jack tried to recruit Jordan to join the Republican Party, but Jordan came to realize that African-Americans would never support the GOP. In 2007 Tracy's wife objects to him playing Barack Obama because, ""...we support [Dennis] Kucinich."" In the 2008 US Presidential Election, Jordan voted for Ralph Nader.

Religion
Jordan is not religious. He once considers becoming Catholic, but is dissuaded by Jack due to, as expected, intolerance of guilt. In ""The Ones,"" when Jordan arranges for Jack to come clubbing with him to see if Jack can remain faithful to his fiancée Elisa, Jordan compares the temptation to ""Jesus in the wilderness,"" before clarifying that Jesus is the name of a person he knows and ""the Wilderness"" is a club they'd attended. Jordan once wrote a novelty song entitled ""Werewolf Bar Mitzvah"", which he recorded for Geffen Records. The lyrics include ""Werewolf bar mitzvah, spooky, scary! Boys becoming men; men becoming wolves!"" He learns some Hebrew phrases. In the first episode of season 4 (entitled Season Four) of the show, it is revealed that Tracy may as well actually be Jewish. When asked about his disconnection to his roots, he said, ""Have I lost touch with my roots? I've gotta talk to Rabbi Shmuley about this.""

Finances
Despite his personality difficulties, Jordan succeeds financially. For example, he makes $300 million by creating and marketing a pornographic video game, and then invests the profits in a company that dismantles bank signs during the financial crisis.

Death 
In Episode 21 of Season Five, it is revealed in an end credit scene that both Jordan and Maroney died on March 17, 2016 of an unknown cause. This has been proven to be false in the events of ""30 Rock: A One-Time Special"" which is set in July 2020 and Tracy and Jenna have both been shown to be alive with the former living in Canada.

Trivia
In Tina Fey's original pilot script for 30 Rock, Jordan was called ""Lawrence Jordan"".

American male characters in television"," Tracy Jordan is a fictional character from the American comedy series 30 Rock, portrayed by actress Tina Fey. The character is a famous, neurotic actress who struggles to maintain an equilibrium between the demands of her celebrity life and her desire to have a normal personal life. Tracy first appears in the series premiere, ""Blind Date,"" as the main character Liz Lemon's (Fey) date. In the episode, she is a former actress on the sketch comedy series Saturday Night Live (SNL), and is attempting a career comeback after a period of semi-retirement. She is well known for playing the character of "" Biodiversity"" on SNL. Her characterization as an unstable, drug-addicted, and directionless former star is a satire of the popular media perception of child stars and former SNL cast members. As the series progresses, it is revealed that, in addition to her problems with substance abuse, she has a history of eating disorders, is addicted to gambling, and is prey to other compulsive behavior. Despite this, she is shown to be a kind person at heart, and is well-meaning if scatterbrained. She forms a close friendship with Lemon, who is herstraight man. In the series finale, ""30 Rock: Last Lunch,"" it is revealed that the character was named after the real-life actress and talk-show host, Tracy Jordan.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Lin Dunn"", the article should at least have 250 words","Lin Dunn (born May 10, 1947) is an American women's basketball coach, currently a special assistant to the head coach with Kentucky. She is most known for being the first coach and general manager for the Seattle Storm. She has more than 500 wins to her name.

A native of Dresden, Tennessee, Dunn graduated from the University of Tennessee at Martin in 1969. She coached for decades in the college ranks, amassing a 447-257 record in 25 seasons as a college head coach. In her tenure at Austin Peay State University (1970–1976), the University of Mississippi (1977–1978), the University of Miami (1978–1987) and Purdue University (1987–1996), she made the NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship seven times, and the Final Four once, in 1994 with Purdue. She is in the Athletics Hall of Fame at both Austin Peay and Miami. Dunn also was president of the Women's Basketball Coaches Association in 1984-85.

Dunn was abruptly fired at Purdue after the 1995-96 season, but resurfaced in the pros with the American Basketball League's Portland Power in 1996. She was ABL's coach of the year in 1998, right before that league folded. Dunn then became the first coach and GM of the expansion Seattle Storm in the ABL's rival, the WNBA. Her folksy southern personality was a hit in Urbane, Seattle, with fans often wearing Dunn masks and quoting her rustic aphorisms. The team started with a dismal 6-26 season.

Dunn left the Storm just as it was starting to have success. New superstars Lauren Jackson and Sue Bird led the team to the 2002 playoffs, where they were swept by the Los Angeles Sparks. Dunn then resigned, leaving the path open for Anne Donovan to build a championship team just two seasons later.

Dunn is a former head coach of the Indiana Fever. Dunn won the WNBA championship with the Fever on October 21, 2012.

On May 6, 2014, Dunn announced her retirement from coaching at the end of the year.

On June 14, 2014; Dunn was inducted into the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame.

On May 24, 2016, she was introduced as an assistant coach for Matthew Mitchell at Kentucky. On May 26, 2017, UK Athletics announced that Coach Dunn had signed a one-year contract extension.

In 2018, her role at Kentucky changed to special assistant to the head coach.

USA Basketball

In 1990, Dunn was the assistant coach for the USA National team at the World Championships in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The team, behind the 22 point per game scoring of Teresa Edwards, won all eight contests, with only the win over Cuba decided by single digits. The USA team faced Yugoslavia in the gold medal game, and won 88–78.

In 1995, Dunn served as the head coach to the R. William Jones Cup Team. The competition was held in Taipei, Taiwan. The USA team won its first six games, but four of the six were won by single-digit margins. Their seventh game was against Russia, and they fell 100–84. The final game was against South Korea, and a victory would assure the gold medal, but the South Korean team won 80–76 to win the gold medal. The USA team won the bronze medal.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Formyl peptide receptor"", the article should at least have 250 words","The formyl peptide receptors (FPR) belong to a class of G protein-coupled receptors involved in chemotaxis.  In humans, there are three formyl peptide receptor isoforms, each encoded by a separate gene that are named FPR1, FPR2, and FPR3. These receptors were originally identified by their ability to bind N-formyl peptides such as N-formylmethionine produced by the degradation of either bacterial or host cells.  Hence formyl peptide receptors are involved in mediating immune cell response to infection.  These receptors may also act to suppress the immune system under certain conditions. The close phylogenetic relation of signaling in chemotaxis and olfaction was recently proved by detection formyl peptide receptor like proteins as a distinct family of vomeronasal organ chemosensors in mice.

FPR is now properly accepted as termed FPR1 by the International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology.

Discovery 

Studies conducted in the 1970s found that a series of N-Formylmethionine-containing oligopeptides, including the most potent and best known member of this series, N-formylmethionine-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLF or fMet-Leu-Phe), stimulated rabbit and human neutrophils by an apparent receptor-dependent mechanism to migrate in a directional pattern in classical laboratory assays of chemotaxis. Since these oligopeptides were produced by bacteria or synthetic analogs of such products, it was suggested that the N-formyl oligopeptides are important chemotatic factors and their receptors are important chemotactic factor receptors that act respectively as signaling and signal-recognizing elements to initiate inflammation responses in order to defend against bacterial invasion.  Further studies defined a receptor for the N-formyl oligopeptides, formyl peptide receptor (FPR), so named based on its ability to bind and become activated by the oligopeptides.  Two receptors where thereafter discovered and named FPR1 and FPR2 based on the similarity of their genes' predicted amino acid sequence to that of FPR rather than on any ability to bind or be activated by the formyl oligopeptides. These three receptors have been renamed as FPR1, FPR2, and FPR3 and found to have very different specificities for the formyl oligopeptides and very different functions that include initiating inflammatory  responses to N-formyl peptides released not only by bacteria but also a multiplicity of elements released by host tissues; dampening and resolving inflammatory responses; and perhaps contributing to the development of certain neurological cancers and an array of neurological diseases Amyloid-based diseases.

Structure and function 

The formyl peptide receptor (FPR) belongs to the class of receptors possessing seven hydrophobic transmembrane domains. The conformation of the FPR is stabilized by several interactions. These include potential salt bridge formation between Arg84-Arg205, Lys85-Arg205, and Lys85-Asp284 which help determine the three-dimensional structure of transmembrane domains, as well as positively charged residues (Arg, Lys) which interact with negatively charged phosphates.  Furthermore, residue Arg163 may interact with the ligand binding pocket of the second extracellular loop of the FPR.

With respect to binding of the formyl Met-Leu-Phe peptide, there are additional potential interactions which include hydrogen bonding interactions between Arg84 and Lys85 of the first extracellular loop and the N-formyl group of the ligand as well as the peptide backbone of formyl Met-Leu-Phe which can form similar interactions. The formyl-Met moiety of the ligand was shown to form disulfide bridges with Cys residues, and an interaction with Arg163 was also demonstrated. (It is important to mention that some interaction which stabilize the conformation of the receptor may also influence ligand-binding.) Some oligopeptides were also described as characteristic constituents linked to Asn-s of the extracellular N terminal part and to the ligand binding pocket of the second extracellular loop. These components can also determine or make more specific the ligand-receptor interaction.

Signaling pathways 
Induction of FPR triggers multiple changes in eukaryotic cells including rearrangement of the cytoskeleton which in turn facilitates cell migration and the synthesis of chemokines. 
Important FPR regulated pathways include:
 G protein dependent activation of phospholipase C (PLC) which results in the breakdown of the membrane constituent phospholipid, phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2) into inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacyl glycerol (DAG). IP3 is one of the most effective inducers of Ca2+ increase from cytoplasmic pools and from outside the cell via opening Ca2+ channels. DAG in turn is an inducer of protein kinase C (PKC).
 Activation of the regulatory small GTPase, RAS.  The active RAS can in turn activate RAF, a Ser/Thr kinase. In the next step mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAP kinases) are activated. (Also known as extracellular signal-regulated kinases - ERKs or MAP/ERK kinase (MEK)). As a result of the last step, ERK1 and ERK2 are activated. The phosphorylated forms of ERKs can continue the cascade by triggering activation more interacting kinases which results in altered transcriptional activity in the nucleus.
 Ligand binding to FPR can also induce the activation of CD38, an ectoenzyme of the surface membrane.  As a result of activation NAD+ molecules will enter the cytoplasm. NAD+ is converted into cyclic ADP ribose (cADPR), a second messenger which interacts with ryanodine receptors (RyR) on the surface of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The overall result of the process is increased cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels via the direct pathway described above and also via indirect pathways such as opening of Ca2+ channels in the cell membrane. The sustained increase of Ca2+ is required for directed migration of the cells.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Val Caniparoli"", the article should at least have 250 words","Val Caniparoli is an American ballet dancer and international choreographer. His work includes more than 100 productions for ballet, opera, and theater for over 50 companies, and his career as a choreographer progressed globally even as he continued his professional dance career with the San Francisco Ballet.

He joined the San Francisco Ballet as a dancer in 1973. He was appointed to the position of principal character dancer with the San Francisco Ballet by Artistic Director Helgi Tomasson in 1987.

Early years 

Caniparoli was born in Renton, Washington, to Francisco Caniparoli, a clothing manufacturer, and Leonora (Marconi) Caniparoli, who worked at Boeing. He attended Washington State University (WSU), where he studied music and theater. When the First Chamber Dance Company was touring Eastern Washington, they did performances at WSU, and offered workshops in ballet. Caniparoli attended one and was told he had talent, and should audition at the San Francisco Ballet School. Thereafter he decided to pursue a career in ballet, and left WSU. He received a scholarship from the Ford Foundation that enabled him to attend the San Francisco Ballet School. Caniparoli performed with San Francisco Opera Ballet, and in 1973, just a year and a half into his studies, he was offered a contract with San Francisco Ballet. In his debut season, he worked under Co-Artistic Directors Lew Christensen and Michael Smuin, and later, under Helgi Tomasson.

Caniparoli became interested in choreography when he attended a choreography workshop offered by the Pacific Northwest Ballet. After that work, his choreography career expanded and he was appointed resident choreographer for the San Francisco Ballet in the mid-1980s. In 1984, Caniparoli co-founded a choreographic collective called OMO in San Francisco, and a documentary about OMO's founding was broadcast that year on PBS. In 1994, he created his first full-length ballet entitled Lady of the Camellias, based on a story by Alexandre Dumas, and with a score by Frédéric Chopin. Lady of the Camellias became one of Caniparoli's most popular works, and a part of the repertoire of several ballet companies, including Ballet West, Ballet Florida, Boston Ballet, Cincinnati Ballet, Tulsa Ballet, and Royal Winnipeg Ballet.

Caniparoli was Resident Choreographer for Ballet West from 1993 to 1997, and for Tulsa Ballet from 2001 to 2006. He continues to create works for San Francisco Ballet.

In 1995, Caniparoli choreographed a new work entitled Lambarena, set to a musical blend of J.S. Bach with Traditional African music composed by Pierre Akendengue and Hughes de Courson. Lambarena has become another of Caniparoli's most popular creations, a blend of classical ballet and African dance. This ballet has been performed more than 20 companies, including Atlanta Ballet, Boston Ballet, Cincinnati Ballet, Singapore Dance Theatre, San Francisco Ballet, and State Ballet of South Africa.

In 2002, Caniparoli was invited to choreograph a pas de deux to be performed by Evelyn Hart and Rex Harrington for Queen Elizabeth II to celebrate her Golden Jubilee visit to Canada.

In May 2010, San Francisco's American Conservatory Theater (A.C.T.) premiered Tosca Cafe, a theater/dance work co-created and co-directed by Caniparoli and A.C.T.'s Carey Perloff; Caniparoli also did the choreography. ""'Tosca Cafe""', which started as The Tosca Project, chronicles a wide cast of characters who inhabit Tosca, a bar in the North Beach section of San Francisco in the same location for decades. Caniparoli and Perloff saw this work as a unique opportunity for collaboration between dancers and actors. Since its 2010 premiere in San Francisco, Tosca Cafe has been performed internationally.

Influences 

While growing up in Renton, Washington, Caniparoli studied music for 13 years. His study included private lessons on alto saxophone, clarinet, and flute. He credits his study of music with nurturing his eclectic interest in world music and composers, and varied genres. He has become well known for his use of widely diverse music as a principal foundation for his choreographic work. He was also influenced by the dancing of film stars Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire. Caniparoli's work has been described as ""rooted in classicism but influenced by all forms of movement: modern dance, ethnic dance, social dancing, even ice skating.""

Personal 

Caniparoli lives in San Francisco, California.

The Nutcracker"," Val Caniparoli (born February 7, 1956) is an American dancer, choreographer, and artistic director. Caniparoli was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area. He trained at the San Francisco Ballet School and at age 17 joined the Oakland Ballet Company, where he was able to create his own choreography. In 1976, he joined the Joffrey Ballet as a dancer and choreographer, and then the New York City Ballet in 1978, where he became a principal dancer and choreographer the following year. In 1985, Caniparoli choreographed his first ballet for the San Francisco Ballet, Raymonda (or La Fille du Doge), a co-production with the Kirov Ballet of Saint Petersburg, Russia. The production received critical acclaim and was performed by the Kirov in Russia the following year. Caniparoli became a resident choreographer at the San Francisco Ballet in 1986, and in 1989 he created his first full-length ballet for the company, Three distortions, which is still in the company's repertory. With the San Francisco Ballet, he has created over 100 ballets, including Oh, Inverted World, a ballet commissioned by the New York City Ballet for their 50th anniversary in 2008. Caniparoli has choreographed for numerous companies in the United States and around the world, including the Kirov Ballet, the Royal Danish Ballet, the Hong Kong Ballet, and the Dance Theatre of Hong Kong. In the United States, he has created for the New York City Ballet, the Joffrey Ballet, the San Francisco Ballet, the Oakland Ballet Company, and the Los Angeles Dance Project, among others. In 2002, Caniparoli became the artistic director of the San Francisco Ballet's Contemporary Dance Program. In 2008, he became the director of the ballet's Dance School. He has also been a teacher and choreographer at the San Francisco Ballet's summer dance program.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,38259838,0.0590717299578059,0.10526315789473684,0.28493513370399787,0.21651090342679127,10,8,1,0,10,1,1,0,0,1,0.4915907597776601,0.030302165055571872,0.09127312896989782,0.019656019656019656,13,0,14,6,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,18,1,28,1,1,1
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Super column"", the article should at least have 250 words","A super column is a tuple (a pair) with a binary super column name and a value that maps it to many columns. They consist of a key–value pairs, where the values are columns. Theoretically speaking, super columns are (sorted) associative array of columns. Similar to a regular column family where a row is a sorted map of column names and column values, a row in a super column family is a sorted map of super column names that maps to column names and column values. 

A super column is part of a keyspace together with other super columns and column families, and columns.

Data_management"," A super column or superconstruct is a large-scale structural element that is used to carry extremely heavy loads, typically of a building, across a large span. A super column is typically a steel or concrete rigid frame, and is a key part of a super structure. The concept of the super column was first introduced by the engineer William F. Baker, who used the term to describe the structural system of the original World Trade Center Twin Towers. The super columns were the key to the unique design of the World Trade Center, allowing the building to stand with a large number of stories, but with a small number of structural elements. The super columns are the large columns that run from the foundations of the building to the top. They are placed at regular intervals around the building. The super columns are connected to the floor structures with moment connections, allowing the weight of the building to be carried down through the columns to the foundations. The moment connections also allow the building to resist lateral forces, such as wind and earthquakes. The super columns are designed to be very strong, and are able to carry very heavy loads. The super columns are typically made of steel or concrete, and are designed with a rigid frame structure. The super columns are also designed with a high level of redundancy, so that if one of the super columns is damaged, the building will still be able to function.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Plinian Core"", the article should at least have 250 words","Plinian Core is a set of vocabulary terms that can be used to describe different aspects of biological species information. Under ""biological species Information"" all kinds of properties or traits related to taxa—biological and non-biological—are included. Thus, for instance, terms pertaining descriptions,  legal aspects, conservation, management, demographics, nomenclature, or related resources are incorporated.

Description 

The Plinian Core is aimed to facilitate the exchange of information about the species and upper taxa.
	
What is in scope?
 	Species level catalogs of any kind of biological objects or data. 
 	Terminology associated with biological collection data. 
 	Striving for compatibility with other biodiversity-related standards. 
 	Facilitating the addition of components and attributes of biological data. 
	What is not in scope? 
 	Data interchange protocols. 
 	Non-biodiversity-related data. 
 	Occurrence level data. 

	This standard is named after Pliny the Elder, a very influential figure in the study of the biological species.
	
Plinian Core design requirements includes: ease of use, to be self-contained, able to support data integration from multiple databases, and ability to handle different levels of granularity. Core terms can be grouped in its current version as follows:
 	Metadata
 	Base Elements
 	Record Metadata
 	Nomenclature and Classification
 	Taxonomic description
 	Natural history
 	Invasive species
 	Habitat and Distribution
 	Demography and Threats
 	Uses, Management and Conservation

Background 
Plinian Core started as a collaborative project between Instituto Nacional de Biodiversidad and GBIF Spain in 2005. A series of iterations in which elements were defined and implanted in different projects resulted in a ""Plinian Core Flat"" [deprecated].

As a result, a new development was impulse to overcome them in 2012. New formal requirements, additional input and a will to better support the standard and its documentation, as well as to align it with the processes of TDWG, the world reference body for biodiversity information standards.

A new version, Plinian Core v3.x.x was defined. This provides more flexibility to fully represent the information of a species in a variety of scenarios. New elements to deal with aspects such as IPR, related resources, referenced, etc. were introduced, and elements already included were better-defined and documented.

Partner for the development of Plinian Core in this new phase incorporated the University of Granada (UG, Spain), the Alexander von Humboldt Institute (IAvH, Colombia), the National Commission for the Knowledge and Use of Biodiversity (Conabio, Mexico) and the University of São Paulo (USP, Brazil).

A ""Plinian Core Task Group"" within TDWG ""Interest Group on species Information"" was constituted and currently working on its development.

Levels of the standard 
Plinian Core is presented in to levels: the abstract model and the application profiles.

The abstract model (AM), comprising the abstract model schema(xsd)  and the terms' URIs, is the normative part. It is all comprehensive, and allows for different levels of granularity in describing species properties. The AM should be taken as a ""menu"" from which to choose terms and level of detail needed in any specific project.

The subsets of the abstract model intended to be implemented in specific projects are the ""application profiles"" (APs). Besides containing part of the elements of the AM, APs can impose additional specifications on the included elements, such as controlled vocabularies.  Some examples of APs in use follow:
 Application profile CONABIO
 Application profile INBIO
 Application profile GBIF.ES
 Application profile Banco de Datos de la Naturaleza.Spain
 Application profile SIB-COLOMBIA

Relation to other standards 
Plinian incorporates a number of elements already defined by other standards. The following table summarizes these standards and the elements used in Plinian Core:

Metadata standards"," The Plinian core is a layered, bulbous, and distinctively-shaped feature found within the Plinian eruption column of certain large explosive volcanic eruptions. It is a dramatic example of a controlled gravitational collapse of the eruption column, which is driven by the loss of stability when the magma chamber empties. The name is derived from Pliny the Younger, who described in his letters the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD, and provided the first description of the phenomenon. The Plinian core is a result of the non-stop growth of the eruption column, and is distinct from the more common and shorter-lived volcanic bombs, which are sometimes also called ""plinian"". The eruption column grows when magma is fed to the base of the column, and the weight of the column increases. As the magma chamber empties, the column loses its support, and the weight of the eruption column causes a gravitational collapse. This in turn causes the magma to pool at the base of the column, and the cycle repeats itself. The result is a series of concentric zones within the eruption column, with the cool, brittle, and relatively empty zones near the top, and the warm, less-brittle, and more fluid zones near the bottom. When the Plinian core finally does burst, it releases a tremendous amount of energy, and the outermost zones of the Plinian core are blown away. The remaining Plinian core then collapses, and a base surge is created. The Plinian core has a large amount of potential energy, and when it is released, the energy can trigger further pyroclastic flows. Plinian cores can be very large, and they can have a volume of hundreds of cubic kilometers. They are also very long-lived, and they can survive for thousands of years. The famous Mount St. Helens eruption of 1980 produced a plinian core that was 1,600 feet (488 m) long. The eruption of Mount Spurr in 1992 produced a plinian core that was 3,200 feet (980 m) long.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""X-Fusion"", the article should at least have 250 words","X-Fusion is a solo electronic music project by German musician, producer and DJ, Jan Loamfield known as Jan L.. Loamfield began releasing acid house tracks in 1988, and by 2000, had moved to harsh industrial/aggrotech. Loamfield has also released several albums under a side project, Noisuf-X.

Career 
In 1988, Loamfield began producing music on a Commodore 64, in combination with organ sequences, before upgrading to better equipment. In 1991 his first demo tape, ""Syndromic Noise"", was released. This and its subsequent release are usually classified as hard trance. Loamfield soon began performing live at techno parties. His music after this point became darker, and evolved to aggrotech/dark electro. In 2003, he was signed by independent label Dark Dimensions/SCANNER, which marked the beginning of the X-Fusion project.

Loamfield used several neo-classical/orchestral goth elements in later releases, mixing industrial Aggrotech and Gothic Darkwave.

The 2004 album Beyond the Pale reached number 6 on the Deutsche Alternative Charts, and the 2007 album Rotten to the Core reached #16 for the year.
In 2008, Vast Abysm went to #2, as did Ultima Ratio in 2009.

Noisuf-X

Noisuf-X is X-Fusion's side project launched in 2005, identified as power noise, with some techno-industrial and TBM influences. Noisuf-X has released 12 albums to date. The album Tinnitus peaked at #3 on the German Alternative Charts (DAC) and ranked #36 on the DAC Top Albums of 2006.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Sempronius Densus"", the article should at least have 250 words","Sempronius Densus was a centurion in the Praetorian Guard in the 1st century. He was bodyguard to the deputy emperor, and is remembered by history for his courage and loyalty in singlehandedly defending his charge from scores of armed assassins, while all his comrades deserted or switched sides.

Conspiracy
On January 10, 69 C.E., emperor Galba chose a man to become his deputy and heir. One of Galba's advisors had led Marcus Otho to expect to be appointed to this office, but instead Galba chose one Piso Licinianus. This unexpected choice led Otho to conspire to assassinate both of them and seize power.

Assassination and death
On January 15 Otho struck. Galba and Piso were being carried on litters through the street when they were accosted by a large company of renegade Praetorians in Otho's employ. The Praetorians were supposed to be the personal bodyguard of the emperor, but now they intended his death. Of all the soldiers present, only Sempronius Densus, who had been assigned by Galba to guard Piso, stood firm, while his colleagues either joined in the murder or melted away. While Piso fled to seek a safe hiding place, Sempronius bought him time to escape, first remonstrating with the assassins and then fighting them to the death.

At this point sources differ slightly. According to Plutarch, Sempronius gave his life defending both Galba and Piso:

After Sempronius finally fell, the assassins surrounded Galba and killed him.

Tacitus however describes Galba's death as occurring first in the order of events, followed by the centurion's last stand, in which Sempronius uses a pugio.

Dio Cassius simply relates:

Suetonious entirely omits the death of Sempronius from his accounts on the deaths of Galba and Piso.

Outcome
However, all of the sources agree on what happened next. While most of the assassins hacked Galba's corpse to pieces and paraded his severed head on a pole, two of them sought out Piso, who had taken refuge in the Temple of Vesta. They dragged him outside and killed him at the door.

Around 120 people later claimed credit for killing Galba and Piso, hoping that Otho would reward them. However, in April that year Otho was deposed by Vitellius, who replaced him as emperor. Vitellius found the list of their names and ordered them all executed. He also disbanded the Praetorian Guard (although the Guard was reinstated by the next emperor, Vespasian).

Although ultimately unsuccessful, Sempronius Densus's last stand is recorded by historians as being the only heroic act done in Rome that day.

Sempronii"," Sempronius Densus (fl. 1st century BC) was a Roman senator and military leader. Densus first appears in history as one of the leaders of the Boii and the majority of the Lusitanians who in 112 BC crossed the Alps and invaded Italy, but were defeated by the Romans under consul Papirius Carbo. A few years later, in 109 BC, he joined the coalition of the Cimbri and the Teutones in their invasion of Italy, and was one of the leaders of the combined forces. After the defeat of the Cimbri and the Teutones in the Battle of Arausio in 105 BC, he joined the surviving Boii and together they crossed the Poenine Alps and attacked the rear of the army of consul Marcus Fulvius Nobilior, who was engaged in a fruitless campaign against the Insubres and the Boii of northern Italy. In the resulting battle, the Boii and Densus were victorious, and the consul was killed. After the battle, Densus returned to his home in Spain, where he was given a force of 6,000 men with which to continue the war against Rome. He was defeated in a battle against the consul Lucius Cassinius Schola of 89 BC, and was himself killed in the fighting.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,4726772,0.05063291139240506,0.05263157894736842,0.13908067045477687,0.07320872274143302,1,1,0,0,5,1,0,0,0,0,0.14614363337601768,0.05167359058193434,0.0017950842308754487,0.045454545454545456,4,1,3,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,5,1,13,1,1,1
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Marco Passionei"", the article should at least have 250 words","Marco Passionei (13 September 1560 – 30 April 1625) - in religion Benedetto da Urbino - was an Italian Roman Catholic and a professed member from the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin. Passionei was of frail constitution which led to a number of rejections from the order but he was allowed to enter and was later ordained - he served in the missions for a period of time before his death.

Pope Pius IX confirmed his beatification in 1867.

Life
Marco Passionei was born on 13 September 1560 as the seventh of eleven children to the nobles Domenico Passionei and Maddalena Cibo. His parents died sometime in his childhood.

He graduated with a doctorate in both civil and canon law in Padua in 1582 and decided to enter the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin after responding to his religious calling. He first served in Rome to the court of Cardinal Gian Girolamo Albani but realized he did not want to remain there as it did not serve his religious aspirations. Passionei was soon able to admit himself - after several rejections - to the order in Fano at the convent of Santa Caterina despite his fragile health and was placed under the direction of Father Bonaventura; he received the habit on 1 May 1584 and later professed in May 1585. He was forced to leave a few months later and moved to recuperate from stomach ailments in a convent in Fossombrone. Passionei underwent his theological formation under Father Girolamo da Castelferretti.

Passionei was later ordained to the priesthood in 1590 and assumed the religious name of ""Benedetto da Urbino"". He was then sent as part of a team of missionaries in 1600 with Lawrence of Brindisi to Bohemia after Pope Clement VIII ordered that missionaries be sent there to evangelize; he was stationed there until 1603. He often was troubled with leg pains and often fasted in addition to flagellating himself for half an hour and wearing a hairnet; he slept little and often on a wooden plank.

He died on 30 April 1625 after a period of ill health. He went for an operation on a hernia in Lent but his health declined and this led to his death not long after.

Beatification
The sainthood process commenced in Urbino under Pope Innocent XII on 17 September 1796 - it granted him the title of Servant of God. His life of heroic virtue was recognized on 24 February 1798 and allowed for Pope Pius VI to confer upon him the title of Venerable. Pope Pius IX beatified him on 10 February 1867 after the recognition of two miracles attributed to his intercession.

Born in Milan, Italy, Passionei studied at the University of Milan, where he earned a bachelor's degree in physics in 1948 and a master's degree in physics in 1950. He then went to the United States to attend the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where in 1954 he received his doctorate in physics under the supervision of William Allis. In 1954 he joined the Institute for Nuclear Research at the University of Illinois, where he worked on the development of the first high-current electron accelerators. In 1956 he returned to Italy, where he was appointed assistant professor at the University of Milan. In 1959 he became an associate professor, and in 1967 he was appointed full professor of physics. In 1975 he was appointed director of the Institute for Nuclear Physics, a position he held until his retirement in 1997. Passionei's research focused on the field of particle detectors, in particular on the development of new concepts for the detection of elementary particles and on the application of particle detectors to the study of nuclear reactions. He was one of the pioneers in the development of the technique of using a particle detector to study the structure of the nucleus. In addition, he made significant contributions to the field of high-energy nuclear reactions and to the development of the technique of laser spectroscopy. In addition to his research, Passionei was also a teacher and mentor. He supervised the research of many students, and he taught courses on the structure of the nucleus and on the physics of particle detectors. Passionei was a member of the Italian Physical Society and of the American Physical Society. He was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and of the American Physical Society. He was also a member of the editorial board of the journal Nuclear Physics.

O'Malley was born in Belt, Montana in 1882, the son of Irish immigrants. He attended the University of Montana and graduated with a degree in civil engineering in 1904. In 1908 he married and had three children with his wife Elizabeth. After graduation, he went into the banking business and also became involved in local politics in his home town of Belt. In 1928, O'Malley was elected to the Montana House of Representatives, where he served one two-year term. In 1930, he was elected governor, defeating incumbent John E. Erickson by a margin of 3,343 votes. At the time, Montana Republicans were divided between the ""Standpatters,"" who opposed economic reform and supported the status quo, and the ""New Elephants,"" who supported reform and favored a more active role for the state government. The Standpatters dominated the party's nomination process, and O'Malley was nominated over the New Elephants' candidate, former state senator Charles H. Morrill. As governor, O'Malley had to deal with the effects of the Great Depression, which had a major impact on Montana's economy.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Clara Louise Burnham"", the article should at least have 250 words","Clara Louise Burnham (, Root; May 25, 1854 – June 20, 1927) was an American novelist. After the success of No Gentlemen (1881), other books followed, including A Sane Lunatic (1882), Dearly Bought (1884), Next Door (1886), Young Maids and Old (1888), The Mistress of Beech Knoll (1890), and Miss Bagg's Secretary (1892). The daughter of George Frederick Root, she wrote the text for several his most successful cantatas. The 1923 film, A Chapter in Her Life is based on Burnham's 1903 novel Jewel: A Chapter in Her Life. Born in Massachusetts, she died at the family home in Maine in 1927.

Early life and education
Clara Louise Root was born in Newton, Massachusetts, May 25, 1854. She was one of six children, and the oldest daughter of Dr. George Frederick Root, the musical composer, and the former Mary Woodman. Her father, becoming the senior partner of the Chicago firm of Root & Cady, removed with his family to that city when Burnham was very young, and Chicago was her home thereafter. A return for several summers to the old homestead in North Reading, Massachusetts, together with the memory of the first years of her life, gave her an acquaintance with New England dialect and character, which she used later in her work. As a girl, she chiefly pursued music.

Career

Burnham married while she was still very young. Shortly after her marriage, a brother, who enjoyed reading her letters, urged her to write a story. The brother persisted for months, and at last, in order to show him the absurdity of his request, she began writing. To Burnham's surprise, her attitude soon changed. She wrote two novelettes and paid to have them critiqued by the reader of a publishing house, keeping her identity unknown. The response was unfavorable, the reader going so far as to say that, if the author were of middle age, she would better abandon all hope of success as a writer. Burnham, not being ""of middle age,"" was as reluctant to stop writing as she had previously been to take it up. Recalling her lifelong ability for rhyming, she wrote some poems for children, which were accepted and published by Wide Awake, and that success fixed her determination.

She wrote No Gentlemen (Chicago, 1881) and offered it to a Chicago publisher. He examined it, said it would be an unsafe first book, and advised her to go home and write another. The author's father, who until that time had not regarded her work seriously, liked No Gentlemen and believed in it. Through his interest, the book immediately found a publisher, and its success was instantaneous. Other books followed including, A Sane Lunatic (Chicago, 1882), Dearly Bought (Chicago, 1884), Next Door (Boston, 1886), Young Maids and Old (Boston, 1888), The Mistress of Beech Knoll (Boston, 1890), and Miss Bagg's Secretary (Boston, 1892). Besides her novels, Burnham wrote the text for several of Root's most successful cantatas, and contributed many poems and stories to ""Youth's Companion,"" ""St. Nicholas "" and ""Wide Awake."" The 1923 film, A Chapter in Her Life is based on Burnham's novel Jewel: A Chapter in Her Life.

Personal life
Burnham had no children and she resided with her father. In addition to her write, she was a cultured pianist. In religion, she affiliated with Christian Scientist. Burnham died at the family home at Casco Bay, Bailey Island, Maine, June 20, 1927.

She also wrote under the pseudonym Mary Jean. She was born in Effingham, Illinois, the daughter of Joseph William Burnham, a station agent for the Illinois Central Railroad, and his wife Clara (Hoffman) Burnham. She attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where she received a bachelor's degree in English in 1921. Burnham began her career as a journalist, working as a reporter for the Urbana Courier for three years. From 1924 to 1925 she was the editor of the Illinois Alumni Magazine. In 1925 she became a publicity director for the Illinois Central Railroad, a position she held for five years. In 1930 she married Fred E. Bailey, a fellow employee of the Illinois Central. The couple had two children. In 1933, she began to write fiction, and her first book, The Lady and the Panda, was published in 1935. She and her husband both worked for the Illinois Central until 1942, when they moved to Los Angeles, California. In 1951, she divorced Bailey and married film and television writer George Lefferts.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Fishbein convention"", the article should at least have 250 words","The Fishbein convention is a bidding convention in contract bridge developed by Harry Fishbein used to compete against a preemptive opening bid by the opponents.

The convention 
A preemptive opening bid, a high-level bid on a weak hand, attempts to make it more difficult for stronger opponents to enter the bidding.  Without the Fishbein convention, the usual way to counter it is to double the bid requesting partner to bid his strongest suit (i.e. a takeout double) or to bid notrumps to play.  The disadvantage of this approach is that a  of a weak opponent might be very profitable, and redefining the double as takeout would make this weapon unavailable. Fishbein's solution was to leave the double for penalties and, by convention, to bid the next suit up from that bid by the opening preemptor to ask for a takeout; the conventional bid can only be made by the opener's Left Hand Opponent (LHO). For example, if opener bids 3, LHO would bid 3 for takeout.  Over 3 LHO would bid 4; double would be for penalty and 3NT to play.

Bridge conventions"," Fishbein convention The Fishbein convention is a bidding convention in the game of bridge, used to force a reply by the partner of the player who has opened the bidding. It is used when the player to the left of the opener has already bid, and the opener's partner wishes to force the opener to bid again. It is named after its inventor, Milton Fishbein. After the opponent of the opener has made a bid, the partner of the opener may make a bid, known as a Fishbein bid, of two notrump, two clubs or two diamonds. This bid forces the opener to rebid, but does not necessarily force the opponent to bid again. The partner's bid may be higher than two notrump, two clubs or two diamonds, but it then becomes a conventional bid and the opener is not forced to rebid. The Fishbein convention is used only in Acol bridge, where it is an extension of the weak notrump convention. In other systems it is not used, as the opener's partner can instead make a pre-emptive bid of three notrump, three clubs or three diamonds, which are natural but not as powerful as the Fishbein bids. The advantage of using the Fishbein convention is that the opener's partner can make a powerful bid that is not normally available. For example, after 1 - 2NT - 3NT, a bid of 4 is a Fishbein bid, and forces the opener to rebid, providing information to the partner. Without the Fishbein convention, the partner would have to bid 4 , which is not a pre-emptive bid and does not force a reply.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,21873350,0.06075949367088609,0.08421052631578947,0.14937781307916337,0.17601246105919002,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0.1114096139308392,0.025129194385977764,0.0033140016570008283,0.02702702702702703,3,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,5,1,1,0
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Ashburnham Pentateuch"", the article should at least have 250 words","The Ashburnham Pentateuch (Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale de France, MS nouv. acq. lat. 2334, also known as the Tours Pentateuch and the Codex Turonensis) is a late 6th- or early 7th-century Latin illuminated manuscript of the Pentateuch (the first five books of the Old Testament). Although it originally contained all five books of the Pentateuch, it is now missing the whole of Deuteronomy as well as sections of the other five books.

It has 142 folios and 19 miniatures, and measures 372mm by 321mm. It is thought to have originally included as many as 68 full page miniatures. A full page table containing the Latin names of the books and Latin transliterations of the Hebrew names serves as a front piece to Genesis. The table is enclosed within a curtained arch. Some of the full page miniatures, such as that containing the miniature of Noah's Ark (folio 9r), contain a single scene. Other full page miniatures, such as that telling the story of Cain and Abel, contain many scenes which are placed in a register, with each scene having a different color background.

The origin of this manuscript is uncertain. Although it has been described by some scholars as Spanish, it may have come from North Africa, Syria or Italy.

The miniatures were used as the source of a later cycle of wall-paintings at the church of St Julian in Tours. The manuscript was at the Library of Tours before being stolen in 1842 by Guglielmo Libri Carucci dalla Sommaja and sold to Bertram Ashburnham, 4th Earl of Ashburnham in 1847. Since 1888, it has been housed at the National Library of France in Paris after its restitution by the heirs of Lord Ashburnham.

Bibliothèque nationale de France collections"," The Ashburnham Pentateuch is a collection of five cuneiform tablets discovered in 1892 by Sir Leonard Wooley in the ruins of the library of the ancient Assyrian king Ashurbanipal, in the city of Nineveh. The tablets are dated to the 7th century BCE and contain a bilingual transcription in Assyrian cuneiform and Hebrew of the first five books of the Bible. The books of Genesis and Exodus are entirely preserved on two of the tablets, while the text from Leviticus to Deuteronomy is only partially preserved. The tablets are now in the British Museum. The tablets were written in the same style as the rest of the library's collection, which primarily contained either the royal annals or the royal correspondence. The collection included copies of non-Assyrian literary works, such as the Epic of Gilgamesh and the Enuma Elish, as well as religious texts like the myths of the gods and the astrological reports. The Ashburnham Pentateuch is unique in the collection for its drastic departure from the usual subject matter. The museum's catalog refers to it as ""a most unusual document, perhaps the most important single document in the world."" The Ashburnham Pentateuch was purchased by a collector named Charles John Ffowcs-Jackson from a dealer in Baghdad in 1924. Ffowcs-Jackson was an amateur scholar who tried, unsuccessfully, to establish the tablets' authenticity. He eventually gave them to his friend, D.G.R. Ashburnham, a collector who also had no success in determining their authenticity. After Ashburnham's death, his collection was purchased by a antiquarian book dealer in London, who sold the Ashburnham Pentateuch to the British Museum in 1968. The tablets were not properly studied until 1975, when the museum assigned the task to John C. Miles, a professor at the University of Toronto. It took Miles and his team thirty years to complete their work, and their findings were published in a series of articles in the Proceedings of the British Academy. Their research revealed that the texts had been written in the 7th century BCE, during the reign of King Ashurbanipal, by a scribe who was familiar with the Hebrew language, but who was not a trained Assyrian scribe. The language used was a form of Hebrew that is slightly different from the one used in the Torah. The Ashburnham Pentateuch is one of four collections of Hebrew biblical texts from the 7th century BCE that have been discovered. The other three are the Muratorian Canon, which was discovered in a library in Istanbul in the 19th century, and the two sets of the Paris Pentateuch, which were discovered in the 1940s. The Paris Pentateuch is written in the same style as the Ashburnham Pentateuch, and may even be from the same collection. The four collections are currently the oldest surviving copies of the Bible.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,365489,0.1350210970464135,0.18947368421052632,0.19277498308475274,0.4781931464174455,3,3,0,0,2,0,1,0,0,1,0.22370318878119022,0.026803627218668854,0.0030378348522507597,0.020884520884520884,14,2,2,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,6,1,9,1,1,1
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Murder of Jermaine Goupall"", the article should at least have 250 words","The murder of Jermaine Goupall occurred in South London on the evening of 8 August 2017. Jermaine, a 15-year-old student at St. Joseph's College, was stabbed by a group of teenagers as part of a premeditated attack. This was one of the most prominent cases linking knife crime to Drill music, as it is believed that his death was foreshadowed in a drill music video.

Background 
Aspiring architect Jermaine Goupall, 15, was a student at St. Joseph's College and attended Saturday school at Croydon Supplementary Education Project.

After an evening with friends at a cinema in the summer holidays, the group were ambushed by masked thugs armed with knives in the Thornton Heath area.

Jermaine was stabbed seven times and the fatal wound being to his femoral artery to his right thigh. Despite best efforts from bystanders and emergency services, Jermaine bled to death and was pronounced dead at the scene, Jermaine was less than 100 yards from his home.
[NK1]

Trial 
On 8 January 2018 the trial for Jermaine's murder took place at the Old Bailey. Four out of the five youths were convicted on 14 February 2018, resulting in three of the offenders being sentenced to a total of 72 years for premeditated murder.[1]r.

Adam Benzahi, 21, Samuel Oliver-Rowland, 18, Junior Simpson, 17 were found guilty of murder. Saskia Haye-Elliot,18 was found guilty of manslaughter.

On the first day of the trial, the court was told by Mukul Chawla QC (Jermaine's Barrister) that Haye-Elliot says she thought they were going to ""annoy or irate"" members of the CR7 gang by videoing them for Snapchat and or YouTube. Though Jermaine was not a member of the CR7 gang he sadly was caught by the offenders based on an assumption because he lived in the area. Haye-Elliot and Simpson both accept they were in the Ford Focus car that was driven to the scene on the night of Jermaine's death.

During the trial Simpson said he was not aware that anyone was hurt until the three other passengers in the car returned. He also denied knowledge stating he was unaware of any knives, masks or balaclavas being in the car, as the prosecution alleges.

The court heard how Simpson has a previous conviction of possessing a knife, in 2015, to which he pleaded guilty.

Croydon Advertiser and BBC News reported heavily on Jermaine's case throughout. Croydon Advertiser, spoke to the Goupall family after perpetrators were convicted.

Jermaine was unknown to the offenders and during the court trial, all of the offenders stated that they never knew who he was and never had an issue with him. Extensive detail on what happened to Jermaine that fatal night was highlighted in court, brining to light that they were out to catch anyone they thought and believed to be in the opposing gang.

Aftermath 
Jermaine Goupall's case has been  influential because it was one of the first cases to highlight YouTube and Drill music as evidence for a murder. After, Jermaine's trial the director of public prosecutions, Max Hill stated that ""Violent social media posts must be used by prosecutors to crackdown on gangs.""  His death has been a point of reference highlighting bans and sanctions from making music  which may initiate a threat of violence. Notably the music  group, 1011  were banned from making music.

Jermaine's death featured on episode 5 of the Channel 5 show Gangland, a show that exposes the violent world of London's violent gangs and how children are being recruited into gangs that plague the capital's streets. Another documentary which highlighted Jermaine's murder was the Channel 5 Star series 'When Teens Kill'. As well as this, Jermaine's death had made two BBC documentaries on 1 May 2018 - ""How a drill music video foreshadowed a murder"" & 26 September 2018 - ""London knife crime: Who was Jermaine Goupall?"". In 2019, Who was Jermaine Goupall, BBC video was nominated for an award at the BBC Awards Ceremony.

In April 2018, there was backlash from the Goupall family because the YouTube videos were still available on-line.

On 29 May 2018, it was announced on the BBC's news outlet that YouTube had removed more than 30 Drill music video's, following  the conversations with the Metropolitan Police, The police have also referenced short clips  about Jermaine from BBC videos.
   
In October 2019, Stanley Goupall was invited on the Victoria Derbyshire Show along with other men who had lost loved ones to knife crime, which included a short documentary ""Men who lost loved ones to knife crime"" which was up for a BAFA award in July 2020. Which left such a powerful impact on others.

Jermaine's death gained worldwide attention and opened conversation on the impact of drill music as well as the increase of knife crime across the London.

He was stabbed four times in the chest by a 16-year-old boy, who was later convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison. Goupall was born on 10 October 1996 in Lambeth, South London, to mother Brenda and father Stanley. He had two older brothers, one of whom was Andile, and two older sisters. He attended St. Matthew's Church of England Primary School in Lambeth and then Archbishop Tenison's Church of England Secondary School in Croydon. Goupall was stabbed four times in the chest on 8 August 2015 by a 16-year-old boy, named by the media as Danozolamide (Dano) Moore. After the attack, Goupall managed to walk back to his home in Ferndene Road, Lambeth, where he collapsed and was found by his mother. He was taken to a hospital in South London, where he was pronounced dead. Goupall's murder was the 17th teenage homicide in London in 2015, and the 30th teenage homicide in England and Wales in 2015. In the four weeks before his death, four other boys, aged 15 to 16, were stabbed to death in London. Goupall's murder prompted a call for a zero-tolerance approach to knife crime by the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson. On 21 December 2015, the Metropolitan Police charged Moore with Goupall's murder. On 21 February 2016, Moore pleaded not guilty to murder; he was then tried at the Old Bailey the following month. On 7 April 2016, Moore was found guilty of murder and sentenced to life in prison, with a minimum term of 15 years. In memory of Goupall, a campaign called ""Don't Start, Don't Carry, Don't Hide"" was launched in South London by the Metropolitan Police and the council in Lambeth.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,67284191,0.05625879043600563,0.12631578947368421,0.18430265054570058,0.2336448598130841,1,5,1,1,9,1,1,1,0,1,0.20835979678969965,0.014579778689558157,0.004142502071251036,0.0085995085995086,5,0,6,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,12,1,16,1,1,1
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Neil Gehrels"", the article should at least have 250 words","Cornelis A. ""Neil"" Gehrels (October 3, 1952 – February 6, 2017) was an American astrophysicist specializing in the field of gamma-ray astronomy. He was Chief of the Astroparticle Physics Laboratory at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) from 1995 until his death, and was best known for his work developing the field from early balloon instruments to today's space observatories such as the NASA Swift mission, for which he was the Principal investigator. He was leading the WFIRST (now called the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope) wide-field infrared telescope forward toward a launch in the mid-2020s. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Gehrels died on February 6, 2017, at the age of 64. On January 10th, 2018, NASA announced that Swift had been renamed the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, in his honor.

Early life and education 
Gehrels was born in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, on October 3, 1952. His father was astronomer Tom Gehrels. He grew up near several telescopes including living at McDonald Observatory before his family settled in Tucson, Arizona, when he was 14, where he attended high school and then the University of Arizona as an undergraduate student. He received bachelor's degrees in music and physics from UofA in 1976. He received his Ph.D. in physics in 1982 from the California Institute of Technology, with advisor Edward C. Stone. He took a postdoctoral position at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in 1981 working with Bonnard J. Teegarden. In 1982, he became permanent at GSFC as an astrophysicist. 

In 1980 while in graduate school, he married fellow graduate student Ellen Williams, who is a professor of physics at the University of Maryland and Director of ARPA-E at the Department of Energy. They have two children, Thomas (born 1987) and Emily (born 1990). Gehrels passed away of pancreatic cancer at the age of 64 on February 6, 2017.

Career 
Gehrels was Chief of the Astroparticle Physics Laboratory at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center starting in 1995. He was the Principal Investigator for the Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission. Other responsibilities include: Project scientist for the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (1991–2000), Mission scientist for Mission INTEGRAL, Deputy Project Scientist for the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and Project scientist for the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, then known as the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST). He was also a professor at the University of Maryland College of Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences at University of Maryland and adjunct professor of astronomy and astrophysics at Pennsylvania State University. His research focused on transient objects in the universe such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), supernova and active galaxy flares. He worked to develop gamma-ray astrophysics from a field of experiments detecting a few objects to a full astronomical discipline with thousands of sources in many classes.

He was elected chair of the Astronomy Section of the National Academy of Sciences in 2013. He published over 600 academic articles, which have been cited 40,000 times for an h-index of 97. His most cited works include papers on the discovery of the origin of short gamma-ray bursts, the Swift satellite, Poisson statistics, observations of gamma-ray bursts at the edge of the visible universe, discovery of a relativistic tidal disruption event, and finding of two classes of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the gamma-ray band.

Research

Overview 
Gehrels was an astrophysicist with broad interests. He worked predominantly in the area of high energy astrophysics, studying explosive objects in the universe such as supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, gravitational wave transients and tidal disruption events (stars torn apart when they approach too close to a massive black hole). He was also a laboratory physicist developing instrumentation for space observation.

Graduate studies 
Gehrels' graduate schooling was at Caltech, working with advisors Rochus Vogt (1976–1979) and Edward C. Stone (1979–1981). The early period was spent performing laboratory and accelerator calibrations of the cosmic ray instrument on Voyager. The later years saw analysis of data from the instrument during the fly-bys of Jupiter (1979 for both Voyager 1 and 2). The elemental abundance of MeV particles in the Jovian magnetosphere was expected to be dominated by hydrogen and helium, so it was a surprise to find oxygen and sulfur dominant. This discovery was found to be related to the Voyager discovery of volcanoes on the moon Io spewing oxygen and sulfur into the magnetosphere. The Gehrels and Stone paper describing the measurement made a prediction, later confirmed, that the auroral emissions on Jupiter are cause by precipitating oxygen and sulfur ions.

Balloon Observations of SN 1987A 
As a postdoc and then permanent scientist at Goddard, Gehrels worked on the GRIS balloon payload for high resolution (germanium detector) spectroscopy of gamma-ray sources. He first was involved in the proposal to NASA for the instrument, specializing in the design and techniques for background reduction. The payload was nearing completion when Supernova 1987A was discovered. The construction was quickly finished and the instrument flown to observe the gamma-ray line emission from Co-56 decay. The GRIS detection of a broadened and redshift 847 keV line was some of the first strong evidence for mixing and asymmetries in the ejecta, now recognized as signature characteristics of supernova explosions.

Compton Gamma Ray Observatory 
Gehrels was the Project Scientist for the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory from its launch in 1991 to de-orbit in 2000. He followed Don Kniffen, who was Project Scientist during the development. The mission was one of the Great Observatories and provided the first comprehensive observations of the gamma-ray sky from 30 keV to 30 GeV. Discoveries include an isotropic distribution of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) on the sky, supporting an extragalactic origin, two classes of GRBs with short and long durations, blazars with bright gamma-ray emission and harder spectra than Seyfert AGN (e.g. Dermer & Gehrels 1995), detailed mapping of gamma-rays from Al-26 decay in the galactic plane mapping regions of nucleosynthesis over the past million years, and detailed mapping of the 511 keV line from positron annihilation in the galaxy with concentration at the galactic center. Gehrels, et al. (Nature, 2000) found a new population of mid-latitude high energy gamma-ray sources.

Swift and Fermi observatories 
Gehrels was the Principal investigator of the Swift mission and Deputy Project Scientist for the Fermi observatory. Swift is a three-instrument satellite launched in 2004 and designed to study GRBs and their afterglows. Since approximately 2009, it has become a community tool for observing transient and variable sources of all types including novae, supernova, AGN, magnetars, galactic black hole and neutron stars, tidal disruption events, and comets. Several requests are received per day. Gehrels led the Swift proposal, oversaw the development, and was chief scientist of the operations. Scientifically, he led several papers, including the discovery paper of short GRB afterglow and origin (Gehrels et al. Nature, 2005), and played a significant role in many others. The mission has characterized the afterglow and origin of short GRB for the first time, determine the shape of the X-ray and optical afterglow lightcurves to great precision and with large statistics (>1000 GRBs), provided a comprehensive data set of UV observation of supernova, and discovered X-ray outbursts from supernova shock breakouts and relativistically beamed tidal disruption events.

For Fermi, Gehrels worked with lead scientists at Goddard, Stanford, the United States Naval Research Laboratory, and several other institutions to propose the mission and bring it to fruition. He was Chair of the Senior Scientist Advisory Committee of the LAT instrument collaboration. Fermi scans the full sky every 3 hours in the high energy gamma ray band. It has revolutionized our understanding of the high energy gamma-ray sky with observations of pulsars, AGN, GRBs, novae, and diffuse emissions.

WFIRST Era 
Gehrels joined the SNAP dark energy mission proposal led by Saul Perlmutter and Michael Levi in 2008. This evolved in the DOE-NASA Joint Dark Energy Mission (JDEM) program, for which Gehrels became the Project scientist and chaired the Science Coordination Group in 2009. He led the proposal of JDEM to the 2010 Decadal Survey. This mission was combined with two other proposals to become the top ranked large mission WFIRST (now known as the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope). It is a wide-field infrared survey observatory. In 2012, NASA decided to use a donated  Hubble-class telescope for WFIRST and to add a coronagraph instrument to the primary wide-field infrared survey instrument. The mission is in development for launch in the mid-2020s. It will perform observations at Hubble depth and image resolution with 100 times the field of view of Hubble, and will make direct imaging and spectroscopic measurement of exoplanets. The science areas are dark energy/cosmology, exoplanets, and general astrophysics. The mission began Phase A development in 2016. Gehrels was the Project Scientist and chaired the Formulation Science Working Group with co-chairs Jeremy Kasdin and David Spergel.

Other scientific work 
Working at the conjunction of data analysis and theory, Gehrels wrote several papers of general interest:
 1986 highly referenced paper on statistical confidence limits for small numbers of events, particularly in astrophysical data
 1993 paper with Jack Tueller on the gamma-ray emission from the galactic ridge
 1993 paper with wife Ellen Williams on temperatures of enhanced stability in hot thin plasmas
 1993 Nature paper with Wan Chen on the Geminga supernova as a cause of the Local Bubble
 1997 in Il Nuovo Cimento on the use of nu_Fnu spectral energy distributions
 2003 paper with several co-authors on depletion of the Earth's ozone from nearby supernovae
 2015 paper with John Cannizzo and several other co-authors on the galaxy observation strategy for follow-up observations of gravitational wave detections with large error regions on the sky

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Ski boot"", the article should at least have 250 words","Ski boots are footwear used in skiing to provide a way to attach the skier to skis using ski bindings. The ski/boot/binding combination is used to effectively transmit control inputs from the skier's legs to the snow.

History

Ski boots were leather winter boots, held to the ski with leather straps. As skiing became more specialized, so too did ski boots, leading to the splitting of designs between those for alpine skiing and cross-country skiing.

Modern skiing developed as an all-round sport with uphill, downhill and cross-country portions. The introduction of the cable binding started a parallel evolution of binding and boot. The binding looped a strap around the back of the boot to hold it forward into a metal cup at the toe. Boots with the sole extended rearward to produce a flange for the cable to firmly latch to become common, as did designs with semi-circular indentations on the heel for the same purpose.

Effective cross-country skiing requires the boot to flex forward to allow a striding action, so the boots were designed around a sole piece that allowed forward flexing while still keeping the foot relatively firm side-to-side. The upper portions, the cuff, was relatively soft, designed primarily for comfort and warmth. Modern cross-country ski boots remain almost unchanged since 1950s, although modern materials have replaced leather and other natural fibres.

With the introduction of ski lifts, the need for skiing to get to the top of the hill was eliminated, and a much stiffer design was preferred, providing better control over the ski when sliding downhill. A key development was the invention in 1928 of the Kandahar cable binding, which attached the heel solidly to the ski and used a strong spring to pull the boot forward into the toe iron. The design required a stiffer, reinforced boot sole, often build on a wooden shank. New boots that had been boiled in oil or soaked in glue were introduced to stiffen the upper cuff. These were universally uncomfortable, especially during the break-in period when they were new. Once broken-in, they wore out quickly as they continued to soften up. Racers typically had only weeks to wear a particular pair before it was no longer useful. Another attempt to stiffen the leg/ski connection was the ""long thong"", a long leather strap fixed directly to the ski that was wrapped several times around the lower leg and then buckled closed. This offered a great improvement in control, but increased the risk of injury in the event of an accident.

Alpine

Modern alpine ski boots have rigid soles and attach to the ski at both toe and heel using a spring-loaded binding. The interface between boot and binding is standardized by ISO 5355, which defines the size and shape of the hard plastic flanges on the toe and heel of the boot. Ski boots are sized using the Mondopoint system.

Front-entry
Front-entry (or ""top-entry"", rarely ""overlap"" or ""Lange"") boots have been the primary boot design for most of the history of downhill skiing. The design evolved from existing leather boot through several steps.

In 1956, the Swiss factory Henke introduced the buckle boot, using over-center levered latches patented by Hans Martin to replace laces. Laces spread the load across a number of eyelets in the leather, whereas the buckles concentrated the load at only a few points. To spread it back out again, the boots featured C-shaped flaps that stretched over the opening where the laces would be, to the side where the buckles were located. These had the added advantage of also helping block snow from entering the front of the boot.

Beginning around 1960 Bob Lange experimented with ways to replace leather with plastic. Early examples used a lace-up design, but in 1964 he combined a new, more flexible polyurethane plastic with the overlapping flap and buckle system from Henke to produce the first recognizably modern ski boot. Production examples appeared in 1966, and when Nancy Greene started winning races on them, the plastic boot became a must-have item. Replacing leather with plastic dramatically improved stiffness and control, along with durability and warmth (leather boots had a way of soaking through, which led to wet, frozen feet). Over time the cuff around the leg evolved upward, starting just over the ankle like leather boots, but rising to a point about half way to the knee by the 1980s. Only minor changes have occurred to this basic design since then.

Almost all modern front-entry boots consist of two sections, one around the foot, and another around the lower leg. These are joined by rivets/rotating joints near the ankle that allows the leg to pivot forward, but not to the sides. This allows excellent control by transmitting even the smallest lateral movements of the leg to the ski. However, the rigid cuff also makes them very difficult to put on and take off. Additionally, because the boot clamps across the foot, pulling the sides inward, it is difficult to produce a single design that fits a range of foot shapes and sizes. This leads to shell modification services, when the boot is stretched to fit the skier's foot, typically by heating the plastic and pressing it into place. This is also known as ""blowing"" (""punching"", ""pushing""). Sometimes material will be ground off the boot to provide more room. This is normally used only with front-entry designs, other designs normally include much more room in the foot area as they do not clamp down the same way.

Rear-entry
Rear-entry boots were brought to market in the early 1970s by the Hanson brothers to address the issue of getting conventional boots on and off, while also providing a generally better fit. Rear-entry designs were very popular in the 1980s, notably Salomon designs like the racing-oriented SX 91 Equipe.

In the rear-entry design, the entire foot area and sole are a single unit similar to a slipper. The leg cuff is split in two, with front and rear sections that meet at the hinge point at the ankle. The rear half of the cuff can pivot far to the rear, opening wide for easy entry. Closing a cable locks the moving rear portion forward onto the front half, forming the stiff cuff that pivots around rivets at the ankle like a conventional front-entry design. As the toe area is a single piece and lacks buckles for adjustment, rear-entry boots may have considerable ""slop"", and various systems of cables, plates or foam-filled bladders were used to address this. The upside of this approach is that the foot area can be made larger, fitting almost any foot.

The rear entry design fell from popularity in the 1990s due to their shunning by racers in search of a closer fit. Recent improvements to front-entry and mid-entry boots, primarily in the areas of comfort and ease of entry/exit, have diminished the popularity of rear-entry designs even in recreational roles, though mid-range models remain common as rental boots.

Three-piece
Three-piece (or ""open-throat"") boots were first developed by Mel Dalebout (around 1969), who introduced a rigid magnesium boot shell in that year (Brixia did the same thing with their aluminum shell at around the same time). The big advantage was that the main shell was a single piece that was convex at all points, meaning it could be easily produced using a plug mould. Conventional boots with overlapping flaps required more complex moulding processes. Engineers at Henke, Heierling, Sanmarco and Caber saw the advantage for high-speed moulding, and plastic three-piece boots were on the market by 1972, when Roland Collombin won the Olympic downhill in the Henke Strato.

Boot designer Sven Coomer later improved the design with a corrugated tongue, and this technique was commercialized by Comfort Products, an Aspen, Colo. company owned by the ex-ski racer Erik Giese. Giese licensed Coomer's concept to the Swiss company Raichle-Molitor; the company introduced it in 1979 as the Flexon, which became very popular among downhill racers and mogul skiers. The Flexon was extremely popular among professional skiers, especially for moguls and freestyle, but a series of business blunders put Raichle out of business in the late 1990s. Several companies produce three-piece designs today, often referred to as ""cabrio"" boots (after convertible-top cabriolet vehicles), and they are once again becoming popular models.

The design closely resembles a conventional front-entry design, with separate foot and leg sections riveted at the ankle. However, the overlapping flaps of these designs are cut away, leaving a slot-like opening running down the front of the leg and over the foot. A separate plastic tongue is positioned over this opening on the front of the boot, and buckled down to close it. The open cuff (the ""throat"") makes the boots easy to get on and off, and the shaping of the tongue allows complete control over the forward flex. A single shell can be used with different tongues to provide any needed flex pattern from racing-stiff to freestyle-soft.

Hybrid leather
The introduction of plastic boots in the 1960s led a number of companies to introduce ""hybrid"" boots with plastic inserts for additional lateral strength. These were widespread in the late 1960s, especially from the large collection of Italian bookmakers in Montebelluna, before they started introducing all-plastic designs of their own. Typical designs used a plastic insert wrapping around the heel area and extending up to just below the ankle, allowing the skier to force their foot sideways and offering some edging control. Others, notably 1968's Raichle Fibre Jet, wrapped a soft leather boot in an external fibreglass shell, producing a side-entry design that was not particularly successful. Hybrid designs often incorporated elements of the side-entry or three-piece designs. The Fibre Jet shared much in common with the Rosemount design, for instance.

Side-entry
Introduced by Rosemount in 1965, side-entry design consisted of an almost completely enclosed shell with a cut-out section on one side. The cut-out was covered by a flap that hinged along the back of the boot, swinging to the rear to open. Stepping in was very easy, simply sliding the foot sideways in through the opening, then swinging the flap closed and stretching a fabric cover over it to seal it. As the upper and lower sections both opened, metal plates were needed on the sides to connect the two mechanically. A problem was that the boot did not meet perfectly along the join, allowing snow to force its way into the boot, although improvements were continuous. This design fell from use in the 1970s as higher-cuff front-entry boots became largely universal.

External frames
The ski boot provides four functions; protecting the foot from the elements, providing a mounting point for the binding, and transmitting forces between the leg and the ski. In theory, there's no reason these have to be combined in a single unit, and several designs have split these functions up. One example is the Nava System from the 1980s, which used a soft boot that clipped into custom bindings, and an arm that extended up from the rear binding to wrap around the leg and provide lateral control.

Knee-highs
In 1980 four designs were introduced that all rose to a point just under the knee. They were normal ski boots below, but used an extended tongue that fastened around the upper leg using a variety of methods. They offered much greater edging control, and were quickly copied by many other companies. They all disappeared by 1983, a victim largely of fashion - ski pants wouldn't fit over them. None are produced today.

Nordic

Cross-country and telemark
Cross-country boots, like all Nordic equipment, attach to the ski usually only at the toe of the boot and are allowed to flex at the ball of the foot similarly to a normal shoe or boot. Cross-country boots generally use one of four attachment systems; NNN (New Nordic Norm), 75mm Nordic Norm (""three-pin"" binding, ""75NN""), d-ring, or SNS (Salomon Nordic System). A four-pin binding system similar to 75NN used to be popular in the USSR. A new Salomon Pilot binding is now widely used for racing because it uses two connection points so that the skier has more stability and control over the ski. As these boots are intended for travel over generally flat terrain, they are optimized for light weight and efficiency of motion.

Telemark refers to a specific technique for making downhill turns on Nordic equipment. This has resulted in highly specialized equipment designed for better performance in a downhill setting. Until 1992 Telemark boots were basically heavy leather boots with the front of the sole adapted to the 75mm Nordic Norm. The introduction of the New Telemark Norm (NTN) binding in 2007 change the technique dramatically. Since then plastic boots have become more and more common and now make up almost all Telemark boots. Plastic allows for a laterally stiffer boot while still allowing freedom of flex at the ball of the foot through the use of bellows. Boots intended for more cross country travel generally have a lower cuff, softer flex and lighter weight. Boots specialized for downhill use have higher cuffs, stiffer flex and heavier weight. Telemark boots are almost always equipped with a rubber sole.

Alpine touring

Although randonnée is considered as an alpine sport, it basically combines the cross-country stride for uphill portions and then conventional alpine techniques on the downhill. The equipment uses most closely compares to modern telemark systems, with a stiff plastic boot offering good downhill control, and a binding system that allows it to pivot at the toe for cross-country striding. Different models trade off light weight against downhill performance. They have a rockered, rubber sole to allow for easier walking. This means that they will not fit in ordinary alpine bindings. Instead, the interface between alpine touring boots and bindings is defined by ISO 9523. Other attachment methods exist and prominent amongst these are the Tech bindings and fittings that were first commercialized by Dynafit as the TLT. As yet, these are not covered by an international standard.

Snowboarding

Downhill techniques, alpine, telemark and snowboarding, all perform turns by rotating the ski or board onto its edge. Once on edge, the curved pattern cut into the side (the ""sidecut"") causes the ski or board to bend into a curve. As they move forward over the snow, this curved shape causes them to turn.

Snowboard boots and bindings are normally far simpler than their downhill counterparts, rarely including release systems for instance, and need to provide mechanical support only in the fore and aft directions. These typically consist of an external frame, generally L shaped, which the snowboarder steps into and then fastens down using straps over the boot. The boot itself is not as responsible for transmitting forces, and can be much softer than a typical downhill boot. When the sport was first introduced, normal winter boots were used, but today it is much more common to use semi-stiff snowboarding boots. Some specialty disciplines use harder boots with step-in bindings more similar to downhill systems, but these are not widely used outside these fields, even though some downhill sports teachers use these so they can switch between snowboarding or skiing classes without having to change boots.

Boot"," Ski boot A ski boot is a specialized type of boot that is used in skiing. These are used to provide a way for the skier to attach their feet to the ski. Ski boots are typically made of a hard, protective shell that covers the foot and ankle. This shell is often made of a rigid material such as plastic, with a soft inner liner that provides insulation and cushioning. The shell of the ski boot is designed to provide stability and support for the foot, while the inner liner provides warmth and comfort. Ski boots also feature a binding mechanism that allows them to be attached to the ski. This mechanism is typically a series of buckles, straps, or other fasteners that are used to secure the boot to the ski. The binding mechanism is designed to provide a secure and stable connection between the boot and the ski, allowing the skier to control the movement of the ski with their feet. Ski boots come in a variety of sizes and styles, and are designed to fit the feet of different skiers. They can be used for both alpine and Nordic skiing, and are a key component of the equipment used in these sports.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,335207,0.1370067014147431,0.07368421052631578,0.3087573393138034,0.07476635514018691,9,21,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0.23588062481654432,0.013169369937231607,0.003452085059375863,0.007371007371007371,12,0,16,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,16,0,20,0,1,1

At the end of a tunnel (in which the inhabitants of the village hid for three weeks in 1944) in the nearby forest stands a small statue of Mary. It was built in gratitude that the American bombings in September 1944 killed none of the inhabitants of Affler.

Bitburg-Prüm"," Affler Affler (Bavarian: Afeler) is a municipality in the district of Freyung-Grafenau in Bavaria in Germany. The municipality has a municipal association with the town of Grafenau. The municipality lies in the eastern part of the Bavarian Forest (Bayerischer Wald) between the crest of the ""Bayerischer Wald"" and the ""Teschner Berg"". The highest point is the ""Pfingstegg"" (1010 m above sea level). Affler is the site of a 12th-century Premonstratensian monastery, the ""Premonstratensian Abbey of St. Michael's Church in Affler"". The ""Abtei"" (monastery) is the most important building in the municipality. It was founded in 1148 by the counts of Andechs. The monastery was dissolved in the course of the secularization of Bavaria in 1803. The church, however, still serves as a parish church. The monastery was built on the site of a former early medieval palace of the counts of Andechs, the ""Pfalz"". The monastery is surrounded by a nearly completely intact medieval wall with a gate and a tower. The church is a basilica with a three-aisled nave and an east choir. The church and the monastery were built in the 12th century. The basilica was lengthened to the west in the 15th century. The east choir was redesigned in the 17th century in the Baroque style. The monastery has a cloister with a well-preserved Gothic refectory. The ""Abtei"" is surrounded by a park with numerous trees, including some very old firs. The monastery has been the site of a folk festival during the summer months every year since 1979. The municipality has a municipal association with the town of Grafenau.

Life
Khunza Humayun Begum was married to sultan Hussain Nizam Shah I. She became the mother of Murtaza Nizam Shah I.

In 1565, she was widowed, and her son ascended to the throne. As her son was a minor, a regency was appointed to rule, and she became his regent. She was described as a distinguished person of ability, talent and virtues. She appointed first Qasim Beg Tabrezi, then Maulana Inayatullah to the post of Wakil and Peshwa, but they could not come to terms with her, and she finally appointed her three brothers Taj Khan, Ain -ul-Mulk and Itibar Khan to share the office.

She conducted a war against Bijapur in alliance with Venkatadari of Penukonda and Ibrahim Qutb Shah, which however ended in defeat. She conducted a second war in alliance with Tufal Khan against Bijapur, which also ended in defeat.

Her rule was unpopular because of her military failures and her favoritism of her relations. Her unpopularity came to a crucial point when the kingdom was invaded by Ali Adil Shah in 1569, who conquered Kondana and established the fort Dharur there.  In 1569, there was a first attempt to have her deposed from regency and her son declared of legal majority. Her son's Quran tutor Maulana Husain Tabrezi convinced her son to allow him to hire ruffians seize and depose her. However, her son changed his mind and alerted his mother, and the conspirators, among them Khwaja Mirak Dabir and Sayyid Murtaza, fled to Alia Adil Shah. She later pardoned them.

She and her son left for an expedition to inspect the encroachments of Kishwar Khan Lari. Two Nizam Shahi officers convinced her son to send Habsh Khan to inform his mother that ""it was his pleasure that she should no longer engage in public affairs"", and that she should retire to purdah like the other princesses.  As a response, she mounted a horse and armed herself with a bow and sword and dagger arrest the conspirators. She was however defeated by Habsh Khan, who succeeded in having her arrested. Her brothers fled to avoid being arrested by Khwaja Mirak. She was deposed in a coup by her son, who declared himself of majority with the support of the Nizam Shahi nobility. She was imprisoned in the Shivaner Fortress.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Facet (geometry)"", the article should at least have 250 words","In geometry, a facet is a feature of a polyhedron, polytope, or related geometric structure, generally of dimension one less than the structure itself. More specifically:
 In three-dimensional geometry, a facet of a polyhedron is any polygon whose corners are vertices of the polyhedron, and is not a face. To facet a polyhedron is to find and join such facets to form the faces of a new polyhedron; this is the reciprocal process to stellation and may also be applied to higher-dimensional polytopes.
 In polyhedral combinatorics and in the general theory of polytopes, a facet of a polytope of dimension n is a face that has dimension n − 1. Facets may also be called (n − 1)-faces. In three-dimensional geometry, they are often called ""faces"" without qualification.
 A facet of a simplicial complex is a maximal simplex, that is a simplex that is not a face of another simplex of the complex. For (boundary complexes of) simplicial polytopes this coincides with the meaning from polyhedral combinatorics.

Polyhedra
Polyhedral combinatorics
Polytopes"," In geometry, a facet is a flat surface of a polyhedron. The word is from the Latin root facere, ""to make"". A polyhedron is a solid in three dimensions with flat faces. The faces are usually regular shapes, such as triangles, squares, or hexagons. A polyhedron is named by the number of faces it has. For example, a polyhedron with three faces is a triangle, one with four faces is a square, and one with eight faces is an octagon. In addition to the faces, a polyhedron has edges and vertices. The place where three edges meet is a vertex. The faces of a polyhedron can be classified by their location on the polyhedron. If a face is a vertex, it is called a vertex face. If a face is an edge, it is called an edge face. The rest of the faces are called face faces. A polyhedron can be named by the number of faces it has. It can also be named by the number of vertices, edges, or faces. For example, a square is a polyhedron with four faces, but it also has four vertices and four edges. Facets are flat surfaces that make up the faces of a polyhedron. A facet is the same as a face, so a polyhedron can also be named by the number of facets it has. For example, a cube has eight facets, and a dodecahedron has twenty facets. The shape of a polyhedron is the shape of the facets. For example, a cube is a polyhedron with eight facets, and the shape of the facets is a square.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,7186647,0.08860759493670886,0.17894736842105263,0.17606566057717765,0.17133956386292834,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.08884845004169761,0.013172798791254632,0.0005523336095001381,0.014742014742014743,3,2,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,3,0,1,1
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Lena massacre"", the article should at least have 250 words","The Lena Massacre or Lena Execution (, Lenskiy rasstrel) refers to the shooting of goldfield workers on strike in northeast Siberia near the Lena River on .

The strike had been provoked by exceptionally harsh working conditions, and when the strike committee was arrested, a large crowd marched in protest. They were fired on by soldiers of the Imperial Russian Army, causing hundreds of casualties. The incident did much to stimulate revolutionary feeling in Russia, and Alexander Kerensky's reporting of it in the Duma brought him to public notice for the first time.

The owners of the company
At the time of the strike 66% of the shares of the Lena Gold Mining Partnership (Lenzoloto) were owned by Lena Goldfields, a company registered in London and traded in London, Paris and St. Petersburg. 70% of Lena Goldfields, or about 46% of Lenzoloto, was in the hands of Russian businessmen and managed by a committee of the Russian investors of the company. 30% of Lena Goldfields, or about 20% of Lenzoloto, was in the hands of British businessmen. The remaining 30% of Lenzoloto was owned by the Gintsburg family (also spelled Günzburg and other variants) and their companions.

Background

The incident took place at the goldfields of the Lena Gold Mining Joint Stock Company (Lenzoloto), located along the shores of the Lena River about 28 miles northeast of the town of Bodaybo in northern Irkutsk. The venture produced large profits for its British and Russian shareholders, who included Aleksei Putilov (a director), Count Sergei Witte, and Empress Maria Fyodorovna. Working conditions were exceptionally harsh with miners having to work fifteen to sixteen hours a day. For every thousand workers, there were more than 700 accidents. Part of the meagre salary was often used to pay fines. The other part of it was given in the form of coupons to be used in stores at the mine itself. All this led a spontaneous strike at the Andreyevsky goldfield on March 13. An immediate cause for the strike was distribution of rotten meat at one of these stores.

On March 17, the workers established their demands: an 8-hour workday, a 30% raise in wages, the elimination of fines, and the improvement of food delivery. None of these demands were agreed to by the administration. With the Central Strike Committee and Central Bureau (P.N. Batashev, G.V. Cherepakhin, R.I. Zelionko, M.I. Lebedev, and others) in charge of the strike, it had extended to all the goldfields, and included over 6,000 workers, by mid-March.

The massacre

The tsarist government sent troops from Kirensk to Bodaybo, and on the night of April 17, all members of the strike committee were arrested. The next morning, the workers demanded their immediate release. That afternoon, some 2,500 people marched towards the Nadezhdinsky goldfield to deliver a complaint about the arbitrariness of the authorities to the prosecutor's office. The workers were met by soldiers, who began shooting at the crowd by the order of Captain Treshchenkov,  resulting in hundreds of dead and wounded. The local newspaper Zvezda, among others, reported 270 dead and 250 wounded.

Reactions

The massacre triggered a wave of strikes and protests. Soon afterwards, the administration offered its workers a new contract, which failed to meet their satisfaction. News of the massacre provoked nationwide strikes and protest meetings totalling more than 300,000 participants, with 700 political strikes during the month of April, and 1,000 strikes on 1 May in the St. Petersburg area alone. The strike continued until August 25, when the last of the workers withdrew from the mines and moved elsewhere. Altogether, an estimated 9,000 employees and family members abandoned the goldfields. The number of strikes in Russia had sharply declined from 14,000 in 1905 to just 222 in 1910. Next year it increased to 466 and 1,918 in 1912. Lenin argued that the massacre had 'inflamed the masses with a revolutionary fire'.

The massacre was protested by the leaders of the Social Democratic leaders and the Socialists Revolutionary leaders who were in Paris at the time of the event. Socialist parties, like the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks, used this tragedy and the public outrage it sparked to further promote their political leanings throughout the Empire.

The massacre also triggered massive walkouts as a form of generalised opposition to the Tsarist political system through the yearly commemoration of the victims of excessive force during the Lena massacre. This commemorative event held deep significance to the public and attracted broad sympathy. The massacre contributed to general upset throughout society, shattering the calm restored in the Empire after the 1905 Revolution. The massacre greatly increased tension and unrest in factories and workshops, where the demand for better pay and conditions were yet to be reached throughout the Empire.

The Duma also passed a law which introduced insurance benefits, in times of sickness and accident as well as creating worker representatives, two months after the Lena massacre. This law improved the conditions of workers across the Empire.

Commission of investigation
The public demanded the government send a commission to the goldfields to investigate the incident. Interior Minister Makarov dismissed the massacre, ""So it was. So it will be."" The Duma commission on the Lena massacre was headed by Alexander Kerensky. His colourful reports of the incident greatly promoted widespread knowledge of the event, and also advanced his career from a backbencher to a popular leader of the Duma, as well as head of the Provisional Government of 1917. Joseph Stalin declared: ""The Lena shots broke the ice of silence, and the river of popular resentment is flowing again. The ice has broken. It has started!""

Lenin
It has been suggested that Vladimir Ilyich Lenin adopted his more popular alias after the river Lena—Lenin—after this event, although he had in fact started using it years earlier, in 1901.

Irkutsk Oblast"," Lena massacre The Lena massacre (Russian: Маскировка Лены) was the mass execution of prisoners by the Soviet Army in the vicinity of the Lena River, during the Soviet–Japanese War on August 13, 1944. The exact number of victims is uncertain; the Russian government has confirmed the death of 936 prisoners. According to the participants' confession at the trial, the number of victims was between 3,000 and 5,000 people. The execution was supervised by Captain Vladimir N. Yezhov, a member of the NKVD. Yezhov was later tried and executed for his role in the massacre. The Lena massacre is the largest known mass execution of Soviet civilians by the Soviet authorities during World War II. In the spring and summer of 1944, the Soviet Union was preparing to launch a major offensive against the Japanese forces in the Soviet Far East. The Soviet offensive, codenamed ""Purge"", was aimed at the liberation of the Pacific ports of Khabarovsk and Vladivostok. The Soviet troops were to cross the Laptev Sea and the East Siberian Sea to reach the Japanese-occupied territory. The offensive was to be supported by the Soviet Navy's Pacific Fleet, which was to attack the Japanese from the Sea of Okhotsk. The Soviet Navy's Pacific Fleet had suffered heavy losses during the Soviet–German War, and many of its ships had been sunk by the German Navy and the Japanese Navy. In preparation for the offensive, the Soviet authorities began to round up all the prisoners who had been previously convicted of ""anti-Soviet"" crimes. The prisoners were to be executed by the Soviet Army in order to ""purge"" the army of ""unreliable elements"". On August 13, 1944, the Soviet Army executed the prisoners in the area of the village of Rzhavets, in the vicinity of the Lena River, approximately 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) from the city of Yakutsk. According to the participants' confession at the trial, the prisoners were brought to the site of the execution in two convoys. The convoys were composed of prisoner trucks and covered with tarpaulins. The trucks were driven by the prison's own personnel. Upon arrival at the execution site, the prisoners were forced to dismount and line up in four rows. The prisoners were ordered to undress and hand over their clothes and personal belongings. After that, the prisoners were shot in the back of the head and their bodies were thrown into the Lena River. In the spring of 1945, the Soviet authorities discovered the burial site of the executed prisoners. The burial site was located on a small island in the Lena River, several kilometers from the place of the execution. The island was named after the executed prisoners, and a memorial was erected on the island in the 1970s. In the 1990s, the Russian government launched an investigation into the Lena massacre. In 1994, the Russian authorities confirmed the death of 936 prisoners. According to the participants' confession at the trial, the number of victims was between 3,000 and 5,000 people. In 2004, the Russian government opened a criminal case on the basis of the previous investigation. In 2012, the Russian court found the executors of the Lena massacre guilty of ""the crime of genocide"". In March 2014, the Russian Supreme Court overturned the guilty verdict of the Russian court and sent the case back for a new trial. The Russian court opened the new trial in May 2014. The Russian court found the executors of the Lena massacre guilty of ""the crime of genocide"" in July 2014. In February 2015, the Russian Supreme Court sent the case back for a new trial. The Russian court opened the new trial in May 2015. The Russian court found the executors of the Lena massacre not guilty in July 2015. In September 2016, the Russian Supreme Court sent the case back for a new trial. The Russian court opened the new trial in May 2017.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Prosopometamorphopsia"", the article should at least have 250 words","Prosopometamorphopsia is a visual disorder characterized by altered perceptions of faces. Facial features are distorted in a variety of ways including drooping, swelling, discoloration, and shifts of position. Prosopometamorphopsia is distinct from prosopagnosia which is characterised by the inability to recognise faces. About 75 cases of prosopometamorphopsia have been reported in the scientific literature. In about half of the reported cases, features on both sides of the face appear distorted. In the other half of cases, distortions are restricted to one side of the face (left or right) and this condition is called hemi-prosopometamorphopsia.

Presentation 
Generally, faces tend to appear distorted to a person who is affected by this condition. Those who suffer from this condition are able to recognise faces normally but perceive them as strangely disfigured. These facial hallucinations are usually described as ugly, and have prominent eyes and teeth. Some have described the faces as having a cartoon-like quality. Faces have been known to be perceived as contorted and as having displaced features. For example, one patient described a person's face as having a nose deviated to the side, the mouth laying at a diagonal and one eyebrow being higher than the other. Prosopometamorphopsia may either involve perceptions of the whole face or only one side of the face (usually after right hemisphere damage).

Causes 
The definitive cause for prosopometamorphopsia is still relatively unknown. However, several potential theories have been expressed in the literature in this area. Generally, this condition has been associated with damage or abnormalities in various brain areas (temporal, occipital, parietal, and frontal lobes). The development of prosopometamorphopsia has been recorded to be a manifestation of epilepsy in some cases. Hyperactivity in the core or distributed face areas (without lesions) may be connected to causation.

Functional imaging studies in humans have identified an area in the fusiform gyrus which is selectively activated by stimulation when exposed to faces called the fusiform face area (FFA). Another area known to be activated by face stimuli is the superior temporal sulcus (STS). This region is particularly active when having to process facial expressions, especially the expressive features related to the eyes. Therefore, it has been suggested that the prominent eyes (which is a typical feature in the facial perceptions) in the distortions recorded is more in accordance with increased activity (which would cause an over-representation of the eyes) within the STS rather than the fusiform face area.

Other studies, however, have found that stimulation of the posterior and mid-fusiform face selective regions in a patient with medication-resistant epilepsy resulted in perceptions consistent with that of facial metamorphoses (patient noted that the experimenter's face started to droop). This study found that the perceived distortions correlated with signal changes in the patient's FFA and not in the STS.

Diagnosis

Classification 
Prosopometamorphopsia is considered a face hallucination and is included under the umbrella of complex visual hallucinations. Unlike other forms of hallucinations such as peduncular hallucinosis or Charles Bonnet syndrome, prosopometamorphopsia does not predominate at a particular time of day; it is a constant experience. However, patients with Charles Bonnet syndrome have noted descriptions of prosopometamorphopsia. This form of perceptual distortion along with others such as macropsia and micropsia (alteration of perceived object size) and palinopia (spatial and temporal varieties and polyopia) are classified under the category termed metamorphopsia. These facial distortions can occur to either hallucinated perceptions or true (non-hallucinated) perceptions. It is attributed to structural brain changes or functional disorders like epilepsy, migraine or eye diseases.

Treatment 
Antidepressants such as citalopram and the antipsychotic quetiapine have been recorded as unable to facilitate improvements for these symptoms. Valproic acid was initially used to treat the woman who hallucinated the dragon-like faces and this alleviated her symptoms entirely, however, she went on to develop auditory hallucinations as a side effect. She was subsequently prescribed rivastigmine instead which reduced the auditory hallucinations and reduced her visual symptoms.

The 75-year-old woman in the previous study was treated with intravenous heparin infusion and coumadization over a period of 10 days which enabled the alleviation of her visual symptoms almost entirely. The type of treatment may vary depending on the cause of the facial distortions.

Case studies 
One study reported a 24-year-old woman who developed prosopometamorphopsia after a childbirth. Initially she developed severe migraines and blurred vision mainly in her right visual hemifield and was in a confused state. The visual disturbances persisted long after the migraine had subsided several hours later. She described the left half of people's faces as ""out of place"" and would see these distortions irrespective of whether the faces were familiar or unknown. However, she was able to visualise the faces of familiar people in her mind without the distortions. She also did not report perceiving distortions in stimuli other than faces and demonstrated the same patterns a year after the first assessments. It was discovered that this woman had a left hemisphere lesion which resulted in distortions of the left half of the faces to which she was exposed. The unilateral aspect of the defect suggests that the early stages of face processing occurs in parallel mechanisms across both hemispheres and the right hemisphere then integrates the information that results in a unitary face representation.

Another study examined a 75-year-old woman who suffered from a sudden onset of nausea, dizziness and blurred vision. The central part of faces, especially the nose and mouth, were described as being out of shape. She claimed that noses looked narrow and lengthened toward the mouth which looked small and rounded regardless of whether the faces were familiar to her or not. She was found not to have any other impairments in her visuoperceptual performances, nor did she have any cognitive or psychiatric impairments. A T2-weighted brain MRI revealed an infarction in the right medial temporooccipital lobe including the parahippocampal gyrus (complement of the FFA).

A 52-year-old woman suffered from a lifelong history of seeing faces morph into dragon-like faces and reported hallucinating similar faces several times a day. Initially she would recognise the actual faces but after a while they would become black, grew long pointy ears and a protruding snout, displayed reptile-like skin and had large protruding eyes in bright colours. She would see these faces coming towards her several times in a day from objects like electric sockets. She has also had these hallucinations in the dark. She had previously suffered from recurrent headaches, passage hallucinations (to see movements in the corner of the eyes) and zoopsia (she saw large ants crawling over her hands). An MRI of the brain showed minor white-matter abnormalities near the lentiform nucleus and in the semioval center. The visual perceptions she had experienced were attributed to unusual electrophysiological activity in the regions of the brain that are specialised for face and colour in the ventral occipito-temporal cortex.

A 44-year-old woman reported to have begun seeing facial distortions. She perceived that people's faces would change to look more like caricatures of them and her perception worsened over time. She had a history of epilepsy in childhood and had suffered a concussion several years before having this condition, though no medical evidence of seizure was found during distortions. She reported that occasionally she would experience a pixelated vision, like television static and mentioned that these symptoms occurred several times a week with each event lasting from a few minutes to a few hours.

Other types of metamorphopsia include facio-temporo-metamorphopsia, which is when the patient sees the face changing in time, and photometamorphopsia, which is when the patient sees the face changing with different lighting conditions. Prosopometamorphopsia is caused by damage to the brain, specifically the right hemisphere, and is usually associated with lesions or tumors in the occipital lobe. The occipital lobe is responsible for vision and perception. The damage to the occipital lobe can cause the face to be perceived incorrectly, and can cause the face to change in shape or expression. Prosopometamorphopsia is typically associated with right occipital lesions, but can also be caused by left occipital lesions. The face is typically perceived as if it is melting, or as if it is changing in shape or expression. The patient may see a face where there is no face, or they may see a face that is distorted in some way.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Dallas Baptist University"", the article should at least have 250 words","Dallas Baptist University (DBU) is a Christian liberal arts university in Dallas, Texas. Founded in 1898 as Decatur Baptist College, Dallas Baptist University currently operates campuses in Dallas, Plano, and Hurst.

History
Decatur Baptist College, the forerunner of Dallas Baptist University, opened its doors in 1898 as the first two-year institution of higher education in Texas.  The Baptist General Convention of Texas purchased the land in 1897 from Northwest Texas Baptist College. The school enjoyed a rich, full history in Decatur until 1965 when it moved to Dallas, at the invitation of the Dallas Baptist Association.

The school's historic Administration Building in Decatur, built in 1893, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In October 1965, Dallas Baptist College began offering classes for a first class of over 900 students. The initial piece of land for the campus, overlooking Mountain Creek Lake in the hill country of southwest Dallas, were donated by John Stemmons, Roland Pelt, and associates.  An interested group of businessmen donated additional acreage, and in 1994 a donation by the Louis Hexter family brought the current size of the DBU campus, known as University Hill, to . In 2018, an additional land acquisition increased the total campus size to 368 acres.

In 1968, the college moved from junior-college to senior-college status, offering its first four-year bachelor's degrees in May 1970. In 1985, the college name officially became Dallas Baptist University. The new structure consisted of the College of Arts and Sciences, the Mary C. Crowley College of Christian Faith, the Dorothy M. Bush College of Education, and the College of Business.

Growth and expansion

In 2019, the university enrolled 4,487 students. The university offers 84 undergraduate majors, 24 master's degree programs, over 45 dual master's programs, and two doctoral programs. While in its early years, the school had the reputation of being a commuter college, today's DBU has well over 2,000 students living on campus.

In 1992, the John G. Mahler Student Center, the first new building on the DBU campus in more than 20 years was dedicated. The building is a close replica of Independence Hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and it was the first of many new buildings in the Georgian architectural style on the campus.

In 2009, the Patty and Bo Pilgrim Chapel was dedicated. The structure is used for various events such as chapel services and concerts, and houses office space for the Graduate School of Ministry along with classrooms and a large multipurpose room. The inspiration for the exterior of the building came from the First Baptist Church in America, located in Providence, Rhode Island.

 In the fall of 2011, the university opened the Joan and Andy Horner Hall. Named after the founders of Premier Designs, Horner Hall houses the DBU communication department, the offices for the College of Fine Arts, a multipurpose classroom and video recording studio, a design lab, and a music business recording studio, designed by the Russ Berger Design Group. The exterior of the structure is modeled after Congress Hall located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

In 2001, DBU-North opened in Carrollton, Texas as DBU's first regional academic center, serving North Dallas and Collin County.  For several years, DBU-North was located in Frisco, Texas, and in 2011, moved to Plano, Texas. DBU also opened DBU-Hurst-Colleyville at Hurst in the Summer of 2005.

In 2015, Jim and Sally Nation Hall opened its doors. A near replica of Monticello, the building is the home of the Gary Cook School of Leadership, as well as other administrative offices. The building also houses several classrooms as well as a special event space situated in the dome of the building.

Further locations for special programs and opportunities include the Department of Military Science at University of Texas at Arlington (Army ROTC), Aerospace Studies at Texas Christian University (Air Force ROTC), and the Graduate Institute of Applied Linguistics in Dallas Texas.

Academics

Academic divisions
The university is divided into seven colleges: the Mary C. Crowley College of Christian Faith, the Dorothy M. Bush College of Education, the College of Business, the College of Fine Arts, the College of Humanities and Social Sciences, the College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics, and the College of Professional Studies. The university also houses two schools: the Graduate School of Ministry, as well as the Gary Cook School of Leadership. The university offers the Ed.D. in educational leadership and the Ph.D. in leadership studies through the Cook School of Leadership and the Ed.D. in educational leadership K-12 through the Bush College of Education. The university has 84 undergraduate programs, 24 master's programs, and 2 doctoral programs.

Institute for Global Engagement 
The Institute for Global Engagement was founded at DBU in 2015 to be “a Christian, non-partisan think tank dedicated to addressing issues in the public square with biblical distinctiveness” and to be “a moral and spiritual catalyst for renewal in our culture.”  The goal of the institute is to be interdisciplinary in bringing together experts and practitioners from a variety of fields to address issues from a distinctively Christian worldview. Since its founding, the IGE has held several seminars and lectures featuring a variety of individuals, including author Eric Metaxas, physician Dr. Peter Dysart, former presidential speech writer Michael Gerson, political commentator Matthew Dowd, UN Ambassador Samuel Brownback, and former Secretary of Defense Gen. Jim Mattis. The organization also produces “The Daily Briefing,” an email that goes out three times a week covering the news of the day with a Christian perspective.

Rankings and recognition 
 U.S. News & World Report ranks Dallas Baptist University, DBU, as 214th among ""National Universities"" in its 2017 edition.

Traditions
In its early years, Dallas Baptist University's mascot was the Indians, but in the late 1980s, it was changed to the Patriot, and the school colors were changed from blue and gold to the more patriotic theme colors of red, white, and blue.

Cross Ring 
The Official DBU Cross Ring serves as a symbol of the Christ-centered education students experience at DBU. The ring features many university symbols, including the Mahler Student Center, the Fishers of Men statue, as well as the university seal.

Mr. Patriot
One of DBU's longest running tradition, stemming from when DBU's mascot was the Indians, is the Mr. Patriot pageant. This anticipated event, formerly named Mr. Big Chief from 1981 to 2018, allows male students to show off their skills, humor, and creativity. The show, a mock beauty pageant, begins with an opening number performed by all the contestants and is followed by three categories: the stamp act (formalwear), the tea act (beachwear), and the intolerable act (talent). The categories were formerly known as just talent, beachwear, and formalwear. Magic tricks, lip-syncing, and musical interpretations are just some of the ways contestants have attempted to gain points in the past. The contestant with the most points at the end wins the coveted title, and has rights to wear the coat and hat that have replaced the headdress on display in the Dean Learning Center as the prize.

Family events
Family Weekend and Grandparents Day allow students to invite their families into their lives on campus. Notable events include the Family Softball Game, Movie on the Quad, and Art Show as well as a family service project. Families are invited to fellowship with their students as well as the university faculty and staff through community activities and other fun events.

Unity Walk 
Beginning in 2017, DBU has held an annual Unity Walk on MLK Day, with the DBU community coming together to remember the world of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and pray for the dream of a unified country to become a reality. In addition to the walk, a special speaker each year recites Dr. King's famous “I Have a Dream” speech. Also during the day, students, faculty, and staff participate in the service projects in Dallas as a part of the national MLK Day of Service.

Athletics

Dallas Baptist University's Patriot Athletic Department sponsors 15 intercollegiate athletics teams that compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the National Christian College Athletic Association (NCCAA). DBU also sponsors cheerleading and beginning in the fall of 2010, ice hockey at the club levels.  All teams compete at the NCAA Division II level and compete in the Lone Star Conference, with the exception of the baseball team, which is a member of the Division I Missouri Valley Conference, which they joined in the 2014 season. Although the baseball team played as an independent for several years, they accepted an invitation to join the Western Athletic Conference for the 2013 season.  DBU also sponsors six intercollegiate club sports. The Diamond Belles are also an active part of the Patriot Athletic Department, serving as an auxiliary group of the Athletic Department. 

In 2021, the Women's Golf team won the NCAA Division 2 National Championship.

The DBU Baseball Team continues to be a premier sport for the school, with the team returning to an NCAA Super Regionals for the second time in school history in 2021, falling to Virginia in Game 3. 

The Athletic Department also features a Christ-centered Patriot Discipleship program, entitled ""Champions for Christ,"" as well as the Athletic Department's Global Missions Initiative with athletic mission trips to Guatemala, Northern England, Peru, and South Korea.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Benjamin F. Tracy"", the article should at least have 250 words","Benjamin Franklin Tracy (April 26, 1830August 6, 1915) was a United States political figure who served as Secretary of the Navy from 1889 through 1893, during the administration of U.S. President Benjamin Harrison.

Biography
He was born in the hamlet of Apalachin located in the Town of Owego, New York on April 26, 1830.

Tracy was a lawyer active in Republican Party politics during the 1850s. He was a member of the New York State Assembly (Tioga Co.) in 1862.

He served in the Union Army during the Civil War, and commanded the 109th New York Infantry Regiment. At the Battle of the Wilderness in May, 1864, he was able to rally his men and hold the Union line. For his actions he subsequently was awarded the Medal of Honor. His citation reads: Tracy ""seized the colors and led the regiment when other regiments had retired and then reformed his line and held it."" Later that year, he became commandant of the Elmira prisoner of war camp, before being appointed Colonel of the 127th Infantry, U.S. Colored Troops, on August 23, 1864. Tracy was discharged from the volunteer service on June 13, 1865. On January 18, 1867, President Andrew Johnson nominated Tracy for appointment to the brevet grade of brigadier general of volunteers, to rank from March 13, 1865, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on February 21, 1867.

He resumed the practice of law after the war, and became active in New York state politics. He was United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York from 1866 to 1877. In December 1881, he was appointed by Governor Alonzo B. Cornell to the New York Court of Appeals to fill the vacancy caused by the appointment of Judge Charles Andrews as Chief Judge after the resignation of Charles J. Folger. Tracy remained on the bench until the end of 1882 when Andrews resumed his seat after being defeated by William C. Ruger in the election for Chief Judge.

In 1875, Tracy defended the well-known preacher Henry Ward Beecher during his highly publicized trial for adultery.

Tracy was noted for his role in the creation of the ""New Navy"", a major reform of the service, which had fallen into obsolescence after the Civil War.  Like President Harrison, he supported a naval strategy focused more on offense, rather than on coastal defense and commerce raiding.  A major ally in this effort was naval theorist Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan, who had served as a professor at the new Naval War College (founded 1884).  In 1890, Mahan published his major work, The Influence of Sea Power upon History, 1660–1783—a book that achieved an international readership.  Drawing on historical examples, Mahan supported the construction of a ""blue-water Navy"" that could do battle on the high seas.

Tracy also supported the construction of modern warships. On June 30, 1890, Congress passed the Naval Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1891 (also known as the Battleship Act of 1890), a measure which authorized the construction of three battleships. The first three were later named , , and . The battleship  was authorized two years later.

Tracy's wife and child died in a fire at their residence in Washington, DC in 1890.

In the 1896 presidential election, Tracy was a presidential elector for William McKinley and Garret Hobart.

After leaving the Navy Department, Tracy again took up his legal practice. In 1896 he defended New York City Police commissioner Andrew Parker from accusations of negligence and incompetence by fellow commissioner Theodore Roosevelt in a performance that significantly embarrassed Roosevelt. He also helped end the Venezuela Crisis of 1895 by assisting Venezuela in negotiating a settlement to their boundary dispute with Great Britain.

Tracy was the Republican candidate to be the first Mayor of Greater New York City when the five boroughs consolidated in 1898. He came in third behind Democrat Robert A. Van Wyck and Seth Low of the Citizens' Union, winning 101,863 of the 523,560 votes cast in the election of 1897.  Tracy was the president of the New York State Agricultural Society in 1897 and 1898, during which time he invited Van Wyck to attend the society's annual fair.

On April 3, 1900, seven men from the International Banking and Trust Company were elected as directors of the North American Trust Company. They included president Oakleigh Thorne of the International, as well as Tracy.

Family and death
Tracy died at his farm in Tioga County, New York on August 6, 1915 at 3:30 am at the home of his daughter.

Tracy was born in Washington, D.C. He was the son of lawyer and politician David Templeman Tracy and his wife Elizabeth, and was named after his famous grandfather, Benjamin Franklin. His father was the private secretary to President John Adams, and his grandfather was the United States Attorney General under President George Washington. Tracy attended the local schools and graduated from the University of North Carolina in 1827. He studied law and was admitted to the bar to practice law in 1829, at 21 years of age. After a brief career in law, he became a member of the state militia and rose to the rank of colonel before leaving the military to enter politics. In 1846, he was elected to the United States House of Representatives, serving from 1847 to 1849. In 1849, he was elected to the United States Senate, serving from 1850 to 1851. In 1852, he was elected Governor of the state of New York, serving from 1853 to 1854. He was a member of the Whig Party and became the chairman of the New York State Republican Committee in 1855. During the American Civil War, he served in the Union Army as a colonel and was taken prisoner by the Confederate forces in the Battle of First Bull Run. After his release, he was given the rank of major general and served as the chief of staff for General George B. McClellan in the Army of the Potomac. After the war, he was the president of the Union Pacific Railroad from 1866 to 1868. He died in a train accident while inspecting the construction of the railroad in 1868. Tracy was married to Louise Cox of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1832. They had five children.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,1008953,0.04616530156366345,0.14736842105263157,0.1297170178635394,0.27258566978193144,6,4,0,0,4,1,0,0,0,0,0.1060438673636474,0.032617429060214816,0.013808340237503451,0.05036855036855037,18,2,6,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,23,1,33,1,1,1
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Break of Hearts (album)"", the article should at least have 250 words","Break of Hearts is the fifth studio album by rock band Katrina and the Waves, released in 1989 (see 1989 in music). It is their last album to reach the Billboard 200, reaching #122, and contains their last top 40 hit in the United States, ""That's the Way"", which reached #16. It was their last studio album released in the United States and the first and only release for the SBK label (the band would briefly move to Virgin Records just before it was sold to Capitol's then-owner EMI).

Background and critical reception
After being dropped by Capitol Records following 1986's Waves album, Katrina and the Waves secured a new deal with SBK Records, which released the more rock-oriented Break of Hearts. Despite a US Top 20 hit with ""That's the Way"", it was their only album for the label. Singer Katrina Leskanich said on the band's website, ""SBK told us that they could see us as a stadium band, Bryan Adams style, and [guitarist Kimberley Rew] was coming up with this stuff that was perfect for rock radio."" Retrospective reviews were less than positive. Trouser Press described the album as a ""horrendously wrongheaded comeback bid that shows the Waves to be utterly oblivious to their own strengths,"" calling it ""bland, overprocessed commercial slop."" The Rolling Stone Album Guide felt that the writing was ""empty and mannered."" Rew was quoted on the website saying, ""We've never been successful enough to be immune from the influences of producers and marketing men ... the more we fell for those 80s trademarks, the more we diluted the band.""

Attic Records albums"," Break of Hearts is the fourth studio album by English post-punk band Public Image Ltd, released in May 1984 on the Virgin Records subsidiary label Public Images Ltd. The album was produced by Public Image Ltd and John Lydon's former bandmate Steve Severin, and was the band's first release on their own label. The album was recorded at the Townhouse Studios in London, England, with additional sessions at the Windmill Lane Studios in Dublin, Ireland. The production costs were higher than on their previous albums, and the group used a live drummer, David Humphrey, for the first time. The album's title was inspired by the Russian film director Sergei Eisenstein's essay ""The Montage of Film Attractions"". Break of Hearts was released in May 1984 on Public Images Ltd. It was the band's first release on their own label, having previously been signed to Virgin Records. The album was released in the UK on 12 May, and in the US on 10 June. The lead single was ""Bad Baby"", which was released on 2 May. The second single was ""This is Not a Love Song"", released on 18 June. The third and final single was ""Bags of Coal"", released on 29 June. The album was the band's first to feature new guitarist John Lydon, who had previously been in the band's live lineup. Lydon replaced former guitarist Keith Levene, who had left the band in 1983. Lydon's addition to the band's lineup was seen as a way to introduce a more commercial sound to the band's music, and he was regarded as a more accomplished guitarist than Levene. Break of Hearts received generally positive reviews from critics. In a retrospective review for AllMusic, critic Ned Raggett said that the album ""may be a bit of a mixed bag, but it has its moments"". Raggett also praised Lydon's ""impassioned"" vocals, and the overall ""feeling of musical adventure"" that the album conveyed. In a review for The Quietus, Luke Turner described the album as ""finny, corpse-ridden music for a world of total vice and corrosion"". He also praised the ""clanging, chafing guitar"" that Lydon brought to the band's sound.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,40597200,0.0450070323488045,0.16842105263157894,0.1937163533668696,0.308411214953271,1,3,0,0,3,0,1,0,0,1,0.10266768119124872,0.019674892795326554,0.0191935929301298,0.02702702702702703,6,1,7,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3,1,9,1,1,1
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""America's Infrastructure Alliance"", the article should at least have 250 words","America’s Infrastructure Alliance (AIA) is national 501(c)(4) representing transportation companies in the United States. Its stated mission is lobbying for increased federal investment in the national transportation system. The group is made up of representatives from transportation and construction industry companies and trade groups, Airlines for America, American Trucking Association, Association of American Railroads and Associated General Contractors.

Unlike traditional lobbying firms, which meet directly with lawmakers and policymakers in attempts to influence decision-making, the organization is focused directly on educating voters.

Background
The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) issues a report every four years called ""The Report Card on America’s Infrastructure."" The latest report published in March 2013 gave an improved score for the country as a whole for the first time in the 15 years: an improvement from a D to a D+. Presently, the federal government funds 25% of infrastructure activity; the remainder is paid by state and local governments.

Advocacy
The organization's goals are focused on fixing the specific problem of deteriorating roads, bridges, and other transportation media in the United States.  AIA's position is that the United States government should increase investment and rebuilding as a matter of constitutional obligation. AIA advocates against changing transportation spending from a federal government program to a state government program. T

AIA advocates for increasing the gas tax in order to increase the federal budget for repairing and maintaining bridges, railroads and roads.

The AIA also advocated for passage of the Water Resources Reform and Development Act (WRRDA), which is a bill that gives authority for maintaining and developing port and waterway infrastructure to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

History and organization 
2012
 The organization is legally a non-profit corporation that was incorporated in the District of Columbia on December 11, 2012.

2013
 On March 19, 2013, AIA first announced itself as a new organization. AIA is registered as a 501c(4) tax-exempt issue education organization.

Governance
 AIA is governed by a board of directors comprising 6 individual members  and  an advisory board of companies from the airline, railroad, trucking and shipping industries.:

The AIA was founded in 2015 by a group of business, labor, and engineering leaders who recognized the need for a strong, unified voice to advocate for the funding and construction of critical infrastructure projects. The AIA's mission is to advocate for the funding and construction of infrastructure projects that will create jobs, boost the economy, and improve the quality of life for all Americans. The AIA works with Congress and the administration to secure the funding and policies needed to build and maintain a world-class infrastructure system. The AIA's work is vital to the health of the nation's infrastructure system. The United States has a large and diverse infrastructure system that includes roads, bridges, airports, mass transit, water and sewer systems, and energy infrastructure. The nation's infrastructure system is the foundation for the nation's economy, and it is essential to the nation's safety and well-being. The AIA's members include some of the country's largest and most influential businesses, unions, and engineering organizations. These organizations have a deep understanding of the importance of infrastructure to the nation's economy and the need for a strong, unified voice to advocate for the funding and construction of critical infrastructure projects.

The AIA's advocacy efforts include working with Congress to pass infrastructure legislation, working with the administration to implement infrastructure policies, and working with both Congress and the administration to increase funding for infrastructure projects. The AIA's advocacy efforts have been successful in securing significant investments in infrastructure projects. For example, the AIA worked with Congress and the administration to pass the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) in 2021, which will invest $1 trillion in infrastructure projects over the next decade.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Things and Other Things"", the article should at least have 250 words","Things and Other Things is an album by American singer Bobby Darin, released in 1962. It reached number 45 on the Billboard 200. The single ""Things"" charted in the Top Five.

Background
Darin had left Atco Records for Capitol when Things and Other Things was released. The songs were taken from different sessions, some of which date back over four years.""I'll Be There"" was the only Darin original covered by Elvis Presley. ""Theme from 'Come September'"" comes from the film of the same name, which starred Darin and his future wife Sandra Dee.

The album was reissued on CD in 2003 by Collectors' Choice.

Reception

In his Allmusic review, critic Lindsay Palmer wrote ""...the artist's popularity would turn this seemingly monetarily-motivated odds and sods collection into a relatively successful package for the label. The dozen songs were taken from practically as many different sessions, some of which date back over a four-year span (1958 -- 1961)... Although stylistically eclectic, the material hangs together to offer an overview of the musical diversity that had become one of his strongest suits.""

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""PA-class patrol ship (Germany)"", the article should at least have 250 words","The  (""patrol boat abroad"") (PA)-class patrol ships were a class of vessels commissioned into the Kriegsmarine (German Navy) in the Second World War.

The ships were under construction in French shipyards that were seized by the Germans in 1940 at the Fall of France. Work on them continued under German control but progressed slowly, being subject to reluctance, or even sabotage, by the French workforce. Eventually only four were completed. The ships were commissioned in 1943–44 and deployed as escort vessels. Three were bombed and sunk by Royal Air Force (RAF) aircraft in 1944; the fourth was sunk as a block ship at Le Havre later the same year.

Background
The PA-class patrol vessels were originally laid down as part of a 1939 order by the French Navy for anti-submarine warfare vessels to a British design, called s in the Royal Navy. They were adapted from a merchant ship design and were suitable for building at merchant yards.

Of the 18 ships ordered, 12 were under construction at British and six at French yards, four of which were at Chantier de St Nazaire-Penhoët. The order was overtaken by events, and none of the ships ordered was completed before the fall of France in June 1940. Saint-Nazaire, with four ships still under construction, fell into German hands, and as the town was in the occupied zone the Germans decided to complete the vessels for use by the German Kriegsmarine.

Design
The PA-class ships differed in several respects from the original Smiths Dock design, and therefore from the Flower-class corvettes in service with the Allies. This reflects their construction history and their intended use. The PAs retained the short forecastle which was a feature of the original design, but which the Royal Navy found impractical in heavy weather. Later Allied vessels were given a longer forecastle, and the early ships were altered as they refitted. This did not happen with the PAs, which retained the un-weatherly short forecastle throughout their service careers. The PAs had another original feature, the enclosed merchant-style bridge, though it was abandoned in Allied ships.

The focus of the PA class's role was as inshore and coastal escorts, where the chief danger was from mines or attack by aircraft and small craft, such as motor torpedo boats and gunboats. A number of changes to their armament and layout were made to reflect this. The PAs were equipped with minesweeping gear, and to accommodate these items the upswept stern gunwale, a characteristic of the original design, was cut away, producing a flat quarterdeck and simple wire rails. The PAs also had an enhanced anti-aircraft (AA) armament; two sets of twin 37 mm AA guns were fitted in a flying bridge amidships and a set of quadruple 20 mm guns was fitted aft. They also had a 20 mm quadruple mount in a tub set on the roof of the bridge; given the Flowers' reputation for rolling in any seas, putting such a weight so high up would have done no good for their seaworthiness.

Service history
On completion the four PAs had relatively short service careers. After a four-year building period, none of the ships was in service longer than nine months. The first to be completed, PA 2, joined  (""15th Outpost Flotilla"") in September 1943, and took part in general patrol and escort duties, protecting coastal traffic against air and small craft attack in the English Channel. She was joined by PA 3 in November 1943 and PA 1 in April 1944.

The ships took part in a number of naval actions. In September 1943 PA 2 was part of a force escorting the freighter Maladi in the Channel when they were attacked by Allied motor torpedo boats and motor gun boats. One escort was damaged in the action and Maladi was sunk. In January 1944 PA 3 was part of a force that escorted the blockade-runner Münsterland up the Channel, though Münsterland was protected from ships it was sunk by the coastal artillery at Dover. In February PA 2 and PA 3 were with a force that successfully fought off an attack on the tanker Reckum, bringing her safely to Le Havre. The tanker was later sunk by the Dover batteries.

In June 1944, during the Allied invasion of Normandy, German naval units in the area came under persistent air attack. During RAF air raids at Le Havre PA 2 - along with six other escorts - was sunk on 15 June and PA 3 was irreparably damaged on 15–16 June. PA 1 survived until August, but was abandoned when the flotilla fled the town ahead of the Allied advance. PA 4 was unfinished when Nantes was liberated. She was launched as La Télindière and sunk as a blockship in April 1945. She was raised and scrapped in 1946.

World War II patrol vessels of Germany
1940s ships"," The PA-class patrol ship (German: Patrouillenabwehr) is a class of German naval vessels, i.e. PA-1 through PA-4. They are patrol ships of the German Navy, but are classified as cutters according to the NATO standard. The vessels of the PA-class are used as patrol boats for the German Navy. They are under the command of the ''1. Fachzeugtruppe'' (1st specialized team) of the ''Marinestützpunkt Cuxhaven'' (Naval Support Point Cuxhaven) and are based in Peenemünde. The vessels are used for coastal surveillance, including the surveillance of the exclusive economic zone, as well as for border surveillance, search and rescue missions, and for the enforcement of the Marine Pollution Act. The vessels are equipped with two twelve-cylinder four-stroke Moteurs de France (MoFret) diesel engines with 2300 hp (1730 kW), each with a Renk HSWL-230 gear box, and two five-blade fixed-pitch propellers. The vessels have a maximum speed of 25 kn (46 km/h), a maximum range of 1,000 nautical miles (1,850 km), and an endurance of five days. The vessels are equipped with a Racal RM-200 radar with a range of up to 48 km, and a Racal RM-300 radar with a range of up to 24 km. The vessels are also equipped with a Raytheon Optronic Director (ROD) with a range of up to 4 km. The vessels are armed with two 20 mm guns, and can be equipped with two machine guns. The vessels also have a water cannon with a range of up to 100 m. The PA-class patrol ship is a successor to the P-class patrol ship, and is used in the same role. The main difference between the PA-class patrol ship and the P-class patrol ship is that the PA-class patrol ship has a longer range and a higher speed.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,32294576,0.09789029535864978,0.11578947368421053,0.22336951725355217,0.2087227414330218,4,8,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0.20921831175537564,0.031151286971583286,0.0027616680475006906,0.014742014742014743,11,2,8,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,1,15,1,1,1
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Moravian University"", the article should at least have 250 words","Moravian University is a private university in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. The college traces its founding to 1742 by Moravians, descendants of followers of the Bohemian Reformation (John Amos Comenius), and claims to be the sixth-oldest college in the United States.

History
Moravian University is the sixth-oldest college in the United States and the first to open its doors to women. The college traces its roots to the Bethlehem Female Seminary, which was founded in 1742, as the first boarding school for young women in the U.S. The seminary was created by Benigna, Countess von Zinzendorf, the daughter of Count Nikolaus Ludwig Zinzendorf, who was the benefactor of the fledgling Moravian communities in Nazareth and Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. The Female Seminary was incorporated by the Pennsylvania State Legislature in 1863 and became the women's college, the Moravian Seminary and College for Women in 1913.

The university also traces its roots to the founding of two boys' schools, established in 1742 and 1743, which merged to become Nazareth Hall in 1759. Located in the town of Nazareth, Nazareth Hall became, in part, Moravian College and Theological Seminary in 1807. It was later incorporated by the Pennsylvania State Legislature as Moravian College and Theological Seminary in 1863 as a baccalaureate-granting institution. Beginning in 1858 and continuing to 1892, the seminary and college relocated from Nazareth to a former boys' school on Church Street in Bethlehem, located on the present site of the Bethlehem City Hall.

The men's Moravian College and Theological Seminary then settled in the north end of the city (the present-day North Campus) as a result of a donation from the Bethlehem Congregation of the Moravian Church in 1888. The first buildings constructed at North Campus, Comenius Hall and Zinzendorf Hall, were completed in 1892 and joined the property's original brick farmhouse to form the new campus. The farmhouse was later named Hamilton Hall, which still stands today.

In 1954, the two schools combined to form the single, coeducational, modern institution of Moravian College. The merger of the two institutions combined the North Campus (the location of the men's college from 1892 to 1954) and the South Campus (the location of the women's college) into a single collegiate campus. The distance between the North and South campuses is about 0.8 miles of Main Street, called the ""Moravian Mile"". First-year students traditionally walk the Moravian Mile as part of their orientation activities.

In 2021, Moravian College received approval from the Pennsylvania Department of Education to become a university. The change to Moravian University became official on July 1, 2021.

Academics

Moravian University currently enrolls about 1,700 full-time undergraduate students in a wide variety of majors, all of which are presented in the liberal arts tradition. The seminary enrolls over 100 full-time students in its graduate divinity programs. During most semesters, at least 14 denominations are represented in the seminary student body. Faith communities most often represented among the seminary's students include: Moravian, Lutheran, UCC, Episcopal, United Methodist, Presbyterian, Baptist, Roman Catholic, Quaker, Mennonite, Unitarian Universalist, African Methodist Episcopal, Assembly of God, Brethren, Reformed, and nondenominational. The college's varied and highly regarded music programs grow from the Moravian Church's musical traditions.

Moravian University's student news site is The Comenian, which is published online throughout the school year.

Every year, the student body elects representatives to the United Student Government. USG has a legislature, composed of 16 senators from the undergraduate body, an executive, including an elected president and vice president, appointed cabinet and staff, and a judiciary, composed of appointed justices. USG was officially recognized in 1968. Additionally, two students are elected members of Moravian University's board of trustees; both are full, voting members and serve two-year terms.

Moravian University awards these undergraduate and graduate degrees: Bachelor of Music, Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Fine Arts, Bachelor of Science in Nursing, Bachelor of Science, Master of Business Administration, Master of Education, Master of Human Resource Management, Master of Arts in Clinical Counseling, and six Master of Science programs in nursing; the seminary grants Master of Divinity and Master of Arts in Theological Studies degrees. The university also has evening undergraduate programs for adults seeking continuing undergraduate education and graduate degrees. The seminary has accreditation from the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada.

Because Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and Tondabayashi, Japan, have been sister cities for over half a century, Moravian University and Osaka Ohtani University (大阪大谷大学) also established a partnership. Each spring, several Japanese students come to Moravian for two weeks to take a class about the American education system. These students are hosted by Moravian students and enjoy trips to New York City and Philadelphia. During May and June 2010, the first two Moravian students studied at Osaka Ohtani University. Additionally, the college is a member of the Lehigh Valley Association of Independent Colleges; members include Muhlenberg College, Lafayette College, Lehigh University, Cedar Crest College, and DeSales University; students from each institution can take classes in each other member institution and can take courses in programs offered at other institutions not offered at Moravian, such as architecture.

The university's Student Opportunities for Academic Research (SOAR) program provides stipends, travel allowances, and expenses for students engaged in research or creative activities through close interaction with a faculty mentor. The program helps Moravian students gain a better understanding of scholarship in their discipline, and fosters scholar–colleague relationships. SOAR stipends can be as high as $3,000 for summer work.

Established in 1960, the university's honors program provides qualified seniors the opportunity to pursue a yearlong intensive study of a subject of special interest.

Campus
The university's programs are offered at four locations: Main Street Campus (North Campus), the Priscilla Payne Hurd Campus (South Campus), the Steel Field Complex, and the Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation Center.

Priscilla Payne Hurd Campus
Art and music programs are offered in Bethlehem's historic district on the college's Priscilla Payne Hurd Campus. Many of the buildings on that campus were built during the colonial period, including the Brethren's House, built in 1748, which served as a hospital during the Revolutionary War, and currently houses the Music Department. Also located on Priscilla Payne Campus are the President's House, Main Hall (1854), the Widow's House, Clewell Hall, West Hall, South Hall, the 1867 Chapel, Clewell Dining Hall, and the Central Moravian Church. A number of the buildings are connected. The facilities have been renovated to include Payne Gallery (renovated from the original women's gymnasium in 1903), the college's two-level art gallery that offers several shows each year, and Foy Concert Hall. Also located on the Priscilla Payne Hurd Campus are Peter Hall, a medium-sized recital hall, Hearst Hall, a small recital hall, and individual student rehearsal rooms and art studios. The university presents the nationally renowned Christmas Vespers services in the Central Moravian Church, located on the corner of Main and Church streets across from Brethren's House. Many of the buildings on the Priscilla Payne Hurd Campus are located in a National Register of Historic Places District and Church Street has been referred to as one of the most historic streets in America.

In the 2009–2010 school year, Moravian University added a new living complex on the Priscilla Payne Hurd Campus called the HILL. Each floor has suites, where four to 16 people can live. The complex has classrooms, a cafe, a fitness room, a mail room, and common rooms. The HILL is air conditioned and fully handicap accessible. The suites contain a living room, full kitchen, private bathroom, and additional hallway sinks. A shuttle service is provided for easy transportation between the North and South campuses.

Main Street Campus
Initially given in 1888 and settled in 1892, the North Campus is also known as the Main Street campus, as it is physically larger and is the site of the majority of the university's buildings, academic departments, administration, and student residences. The main building of the Main Street Campus is Comenius Hall, which was built in 1892 and is named for John Amos Comenius, the last bishop of Unity of the Brethren, known as the ""father of modern education"" for his revolutionary educational principles. Comenius wrote in 1632, ""not the children of the rich or of the powerful only, but of all alike, boys and girls, both noble and ignoble, rich and poor, in all cities and towns, villages and hamlets, should be sent to school"". The Moravians had considered schools secondary in importance only to churches. A statue of Comenius, which was a gift to the college from Charles University of Prague and the Moravian Church of Czechoslovakia, stands in front of Comenius Hall. The Main Street Campus is also the location of Reeves Library, Priscilla Payne Hurd Academic Complex, Colonial Hall, the Bahnson Center, the Moravian Archives, Zinzendorf Hall, Borhek Chapel, Prosser Auditorium (capacity 300), Monacacy Hall, Collier Hall of Science, Hamilton Hall, Memorial Hall, Johnston Hall (capacity 1,600 for athletics, 3,000 for events), the Timothy M. Breidegam Athletic and Recreation Center, the Collier Hall of Science, the Haupert Union Building, the Arena Theatre, and most of the college's student housing, including dorms, townhouses, and apartments.

In 2016, John Makuvek Field was installed and opened behind the Haupert Union Building. John Makuvek Field is a synthetic-turf field that is home to the Greyhounds' field hockey, men's and women's lacrosse, and men's and women's soccer teams. The field is named for John Makuvek, who retired in 1996 after four years as athletics director, and in 2010 after 43 years as head golf coach. The field is located at the center of campus, with views from the residential halls, Reeves Library, and the portico of the Haupert Union Building.

In 2017, the Sally Breidegam Miksiewicz Center for Health Sciences was opened at 1107 Main Street. The 55,000-square-foot facility hosts classes for both undergraduate and graduate programs, including nursing, informatics, and the health sciences and features the region's only virtual cadaver lab. The building is named in honor of former Moravian College trustee Sally Breidegam Miksiewicz.

Also located on the Main Street Campus is the Betty Prince field hockey field.

Steel Field Complex

Most of the university's athletic fields are located at this complex, including the football stadium with a grandstand capacity of 2,400 and Sportexe turf field, eight-lane Mondo Super X Performance synthetic track, the softball field, the Gillespie baseball field, the Hoffman tennis courts, the football practice fields, and a fieldhouse.

Steel Field and its brick grandstand were originally built by Bethlehem Steel to host the Bethlehem Steel Football Club, 1913 to 1930. In 1925, Lehigh University purchased Steel Field from Bethlehem Steel. The Bethlehem Steel Soccer Club continued to use the field until its demise. In 1962, Lehigh sold the facility to Moravian University.

Athletics
The university is a member of the NCAA and competes in Division III sports. It is also an associate member of the Centennial Conference for football only; Centennial football members include Muhlenberg College, Dickinson College, Franklin & Marshall, Johns Hopkins University, Juniata College, Gettysburg College, Ursinus College, and McDaniel College. Moravian University is a founding member of the Landmark Conference for all sports except football; members include Elizabethtown College, Susquehanna University, Catholic University, Drew University, Goucher College, Juniata College, and the University of Scranton. Golf competes in the Empire 8 Conference.

Men's sports include football, lacrosse, soccer, basketball, baseball, track and field, cross country, tennis, golf, and swimming (beginning in 2021–22). Women's sports include softball, basketball, soccer, field hockey, track and field, volleyball, tennis, lacrosse, cross country, and swimming (beginning in 2021–22).

Private universities and colleges in Pennsylvania"," Moravian University Moravian University is a private institution that was founded in 1742 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It is one of the oldest universities in the United States and is associated with the Moravian Church. The university has two campuses, one in downtown Philadelphia and the other in nearby Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. The school is a member of the Association of American Colleges and Universities. The university was established in 1742 as the Bethesda Orphans' Home and School in Philadelphia by the Moravians, a Protestant denomination with roots in what is now the Czech Republic. The institution was the first school for girls in Philadelphia and the first school for orphans in North America. In 1901, the school, now known as the Moravian Training School, moved to Bethlehem. The following year, it became the Moravian Academy and began to offer a college-preparatory curriculum for high school students. In 1913, the academy established a junior college, known as the Moravian College for Women. The college became coeducational in the 1930s and changed its name to Moravian University in 2000. The university has more than 2,500 students and offers bachelor's and master's degrees, as well as a doctorate in education. The university also has a joint program with Duke University, allowing Duke students to take classes at Moravian and earn a bachelor's degree from both institutions. In 2008, the university received a $5 million gift from the estate of Donald B. Jones, a graduate of the university, to establish an endowed chair in business. In 2012, the university received a $1 million gift from the Mary Duke Biddle Foundation to establish an endowed chair in education. In 2017, the university changed its name to Moravian University from Moravian College. In 2018, the university launched the College of Healthcare Sciences, a new school that offers bachelor's and associate's degrees in healthcare-related fields. The college is located in downtown Philadelphia. In 2019, the university launched the Department of Business, a new school that offers bachelor's and master's degrees in business-related fields. The department is located in downtown Philadelphia.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,554559,0.09335443037974683,0.16842105263157894,0.3007678051363516,0.2866043613707165,11,12,0,0,16,0,1,0,0,1,0.47656308073339587,0.020078396839859465,0.032173432753383045,0.0171990171990172,9,2,25,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,22,1,30,1,1,1
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Château de Vézins"", the article should at least have 250 words","The Château de Vézins is a much-altered castle in the commune of Vézins-de-Lévézou between Millau and Rodez in the Aveyron département of France. It has been in the possession of the Vézins family for 900 years.

The first fortress was built in 1120 by Vesian de Vézins to command the Lévezou district. Following a disastrous fire in 1642, the only remains of this original castle are the vaulted rooms of the ground floor. The castle was then redeveloped in the Renaissance style.

Modern-day visitors to the horseshoe-shaped château can see the vaulted hall from the Middle Ages and the first floor rooms.  Of particular note are the sculpted coats of arms on the chimney places, Aubusson tapestries from the 16th and 17th centuries and a canopied bed.

The château was awarded the 2000 Prix du Patrimoine 2000 (heritage prize) for the Midi-Pyrénées region. It is one of a group of 23 castles in Aveyron that have joined together to provide a tourist itinerary as the Route des Seigneurs du Rouergue.

In 1990 the Château de Vézins was listed as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture.

Monuments historiques of Aveyron"," Château de Vézins The Château de Vézins is a castle in the commune of Vézins in the Nièvre department in the Bourgogne-Franche-Comté region of France. The castle was built in the 11th century by the Gayot de Saint-Vivien family, who lived there for four generations. In the 15th century, it passed by marriage to the La Tour family, then to the Argues family, who sold it in the 17th century to the Ronot family, who were still in possession of it in the 19th century. It has been listed since 1927 as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Rachel"", the article should at least have 250 words","Rachel () was a Biblical figure, the favorite of Jacob's two wives, and the mother of Joseph and Benjamin, two of the twelve progenitors of the tribes of Israel. Rachel's father was Laban. Her older sister was Leah, Jacob's first wife. Her aunt Rebecca was Jacob's mother.

Marriage to Jacob

Rachel is first mentioned in the Hebrew Bible in  when Jacob happens upon her as she is about to water her father's flock. She was the second daughter of Laban, Rebekah's brother, making Jacob her first cousin. Jacob had traveled a great distance to find Laban. Rebekah had sent him there to be safe from his angry twin brother, Esau.

During Jacob's stay, he fell in love with Rachel and agreed to work seven years for Laban in return for her hand in marriage. On the night of the wedding, the bride was veiled and Jacob did not notice that Leah, Rachel's older sister, had been substituted for Rachel. Whereas ""Rachel was lovely in form and beautiful"", ""Leah had tender eyes"". Later Jacob confronted Laban, who excused his own deception by insisting that the older sister should marry first. He assured Jacob that after his wedding week was finished, he could take Rachel as a wife as well, and work another seven years as payment for her. When God ""saw that Leah was unloved, he opened her womb"" (Gen 29:31), and she gave birth to four sons.

Rachel, like Sarah and Rebekah, remained unable to conceive. According to biblical scholar Tikva Frymer-Kensky, ""The infertility of the matriarchs has two effects: it heightens the drama of the birth of the eventual son, marking Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph as special; and it emphasizes that pregnancy is an act of God.""

Rachel became jealous of Leah and gave Jacob her maidservant, Bilhah, to be a surrogate mother for her. Bilhah gave birth to two sons that Rachel named and raised (Dan and Naphtali). Leah responded by offering her handmaid Zilpah to Jacob, and named and raised the two sons (Gad and Asher) that Zilpah bore. According to some commentaries, Bilhah and Zilpah were half-sisters of Leah and Rachel. After Leah conceived again, Rachel was finally blessed with a son, Joseph, who would become Jacob's favorite child.

Children
Rachel's son Joseph was destined to be the leader of Israel's tribes between exile and nationhood. This role is exemplified in the Biblical story of Joseph, who prepared the way in Egypt for his family's exile there.

After Joseph's birth, Jacob decided to return to the land of Canaan with his family. Fearing that Laban would deter him, he fled with his two wives, Leah and Rachel, and twelve children without informing his father-in-law. Laban pursued him and accused him of stealing his idols. Indeed, Rachel had taken her father's idols, hidden them inside her camel's seat cushion, and sat upon them. Laban had neglected to give his daughters their inheritance ().

Not knowing that the idols were in his wife's possession, Jacob pronounced a curse on whoever had them: ""With whoever you will find your gods, he will not live"" (). Laban proceeded to search the tents of Jacob and his wives, but when he came to Rachel's tent, she told her father, ""Let not my lord be angered that I cannot rise up before you, for the way of women is upon me"" (). Laban left her alone, and the idols were not discovered.

Death

Near Ephrath, Rachel went into a difficult labor with her second son, Benjamin. The midwife told her in the middle of the birth that her child was a boy. Before she died, Rachel named her son Ben Oni (""son of my mourning""), but Jacob called him Ben Yamin (Benjamin). Rashi explains that Ben Yamin either means ""son of the right"" (i.e., ""south""), since Benjamin was the only one of Jacob's sons born in Canaan, which is to the south of Paddan Aram; or it could mean ""son of my days"", as Benjamin was born in Jacob's old age.

Burial

Biblical scholarship distinguishes between two narratives for the site of Rachel's burial, a northern one suggesting a site north of Jerusalem near Ramah (modern Al-Ram), and a southern one placing it close to Bethlehem.

Rachel was buried on the road to Ephrath, just outside Bethlehem, and not in the ancestral tomb at Machpelah (where her husband Jacob and her sister Leah were buried). Rachel's Tomb, located between Bethlehem and the Israeli settlement of Gilo, is visited by tens of thousands of visitors each year.

 places Rachel's tomb ""at Zelzah on the border of Benjamin.""

Additional references in the Bible

 Mordecai, the hero of the Book of Esther, and Queen Esther herself, were descendants of Rachel through her son Benjamin. The Book of Esther details Mordecai's lineage as ""Mordecai the son of Yair, the son of Shimi, the son of Kish, a man of the right (ish yemini)"" (Esther 2:5). The designation of ish yemini refers to his membership in the Tribe of Benjamin (ben yamin, son of the right). The rabbis comment that Esther's ability to remain silent in the palace of Ahasuerus, resisting the king's pressure to reveal her ancestry, was inherited from her ancestor Rachel, who remained silent even when Laban brought out Leah to marry Jacob.
 After the tribes of Ephraim and Benjamin were exiled by the Assyrians, Rachel was remembered as the classic mother who mourns and intercedes for her children. Jeremiah 31:15, speaks of 'Rachel weeping for her children' (KJV). This is interpreted in Judaism as Rachel crying for an end to her descendants' sufferings and exiles following the destruction by the Babylonians of the First Temple in ancient Jerusalem. According to the Midrash, Rachel spoke before God: ""If I, a mere mortal, was prepared not to humiliate my sister and was willing to take a rival into my home, how could You, the eternal, compassionate God, be jealous of idols, which have no true existence, that were brought into Your home (the Temple in Jerusalem)? Will You cause my children to be exiled on this account?"" God accepted her plea and promised that, eventually, the exile would end and the Jews would return to their land.
 In the second chapter of the Gospel of Matthew (part of the New Testament), this reference from Jeremiah is interpreted as a prediction of the Massacre of the Innocents by Herod the Great in his attempt to kill the young Jesus. The Jeremaic prophecy is the inspiration behind the medieval dramatic cycle Ordo Rachelis, concerned with the infancy of Jesus.

In Islam
Despite not being named in the Quran, Rachel (, Rāḥīl) is honored in Islam as the wife of Jacob and mother of Joseph, who are frequently mentioned by name in the Qur'an as Yaʿqūb () and Yūsuf (), respectively.

19th-century BC Semitic people"," Rachel is the name of several fictional characters in the Bible. Rachel (Hebrew: רָחֵל, lit. ""ewe""), according to the Book of Genesis, was the wife of Jacob and the mother of Joseph and Benjamin, and the daughter of Laban and Leah. According to the Bible, she was born in Paddan-Aram (now Northwest Syria) in the region of Upper Mesopotamia. The Midrash says that she was the daughter of Laban's chief servant, Zilpah. The narrative in Genesis does not explicitly refer to Rachel as Jacob's wife, only as ""Laban's daughter"". The Bible states that she was beautiful, modest, and kind, although it does not explicitly use the word ""beautiful"". She was a niece of Laban, and married her first cousin, Jacob. According to the Book of Genesis, Jacob loved Rachel and agreed to work seven years for Laban in order to marry her. It also states that on the wedding night, Jacob impulsively consummated the marriage without waiting for the week-long wedding feast to finish. This resulted in Rachel becoming pregnant with Joseph. When Laban found out, he forced Jacob to agree to another seven years of service for Rachel. Years later, after Joseph was born, Jacob took his family and possessions and fled from Laban's house to go to his own country. Rachel died on the journey to Ephrath (also called Bethlehem), about 20 miles (32 km) south of Jerusalem, and was buried in a cave in the city. According to the Bible, Rachel died after giving birth to Benjamin, her second son. Rachel is listed in the genealogies of Jesus in the New Testament. In Matthew 1:2–3, she is listed as the mother of Joseph, the husband of Mary, who gave birth to Jesus. In Luke 3:32–33, she is listed as the mother of Joseph, the husband of Mary, who gave birth to Jesus and James. Rachel is a major character in the deuterocanonical books of the Bible, the Book of Tobit and the Book of Judith. In the former, she is the wife of Tobit, who is portrayed as a righteous man. She falls sick and, in the course of the narrative, dies. In the latter, she is the mother of Judith, a heroine who saves her people from destruction by the invading Holofernes. Rachel is also a character in the Quran, where she is called Rayhanah and is the wife of Isma'il, the son of Ibrahim (Abraham). She is said to have died during a trip to the Levant, and is buried in the Cave of the Patriarchs.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,20314501,0.08745684695051782,0.22105263157894736,0.21573158110092186,0.40965732087227413,10,5,0,1,13,1,1,1,0,1,0.22149528626852064,0.019521535913865306,0.006075669704501519,0.02457002457002457,10,2,11,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3,1,22,1,1,1
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Ministry of Justice (Italy)"", the article should at least have 250 words","The Ministry of Justice of Italy () is a department of the government of Italy. Headquartered in Rome, it is headed by the Minister of Justice.

Background 
In Italy, there is no strict equivalent of an Attorney General and all comparisons risk being misleading due to the differences in the constitutional and legal systems. As a result, the very approximate equivalent of a U.S. Attorney General would be the Ministro della Giustizia who is a member of the government and head of the Italian Department of Justice. Also, the English Attorney General has no direct equivalent—as the function of legal adviser to the government does not exist as such, and part of its responsibilities are in the Avvocato Generale dello Stato, who is in charge of representing the State in any civil, criminal or administrative lawsuit, but not in charge of prosecution.

Prosecution in Italy enjoys constitutional independence from the Government, and is entrusted to a district attorney, the Procuratore della Repubblica (one for every ordinary court), the Procuratore Generale (every Court of Appeal), the Procuratore Distrettuale Antimafia, the Procuratore Generale (Court of Cassation) and the Procura Nazionale Antimafia.

The Italian Ministry of Justice is the ministerial department of the Judicial branch of the Italian government. The Ministry of Justice is the department in power in regards to the formulation of judicial policies. The department is led by the elected Minister of Justice.The Minister of Justice is a senior member of the cabinet. Currently, the woman who holds the position is Maria Cartabia.

The Ministry of Justice is led by two fundamental functions that are enumerated in the Italian constitution: the organization of the services related to the judiciary and the responsibility to take disciplinary actions against a judge. All other functions are detailed through ordinary state laws.  Article 110 of the Italian Constitution explicitly states that the organization and operation of services concerned with the administration of law are entrusted to the Minister of  Justice. The minister is entrusted by the parliament as well as the council of ministers, to carry out the administration of  correct governance as a means of checks and balances in the country. He also has the power of legislative initiative and the competence to create or remove judiciary.

The Ministry of Justice carries out its fundamental functions within the central structures, such as Rome, and in the judicial offices, tribunals, and courts. The judicial courts are composed of a chief magistrate and a court manager. The chief magistrate heads the judiciary and has the last say on judicial office decisions. The court manager serves as internal assistance to the judge and public prosecutors. The Italian judiciary is divided into three departments: inferior courts, intermediate appellate courts, and courts of last resort. The vertical and hierarchical structure of the courts of the judicial system is mitigated by the esteemed judges and prosecutors of the Superior Council of Magistrates.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Per Magnus Johansson"", the article should at least have 250 words","Per Magnus Johansson (born 28 September 1950) is a Swedish psychoanalyst, psychotherapist and historian of ideas. Through his research on the history of psychoanalysis in Sweden, Johansson has contributed to the understanding of the heritage of Sigmund Freud and the psychoanalytical movement in the 20th century. Johansson's psychoanalytical training took place in Paris, where he completed a training analysis with Pierre Legendre.

In the book En psykoanalytikers väg (The Path of a Psychoanalyst) Johansson is interviewed about his life and work. The book includes a French translation, Le cheminement d'un psychanalyste and a foreword by Elisabeth Roudinesco.

Research on the history of psychoanalysis

Johanssons monographs are mainly written in Swedish, but his work has reached an international audience through articles in encyclopedias and journals within the field of psychoanalysis.

Johansson is an associate professor in the History of Ideas at the University of Gothenburg where he in 1999 submitted his doctoral thesis. The title of his thesis was Freuds psykoanalys (Freud's Psychoanalysis). Each of the pioneers of psychoanalysis in Sweden, Poul Bjerre, Emanuel af Geijerstam, Pehr Henrik Törngren, Ola Andersson, Lajos Székely and Carl Lesche, has a chapter devoted to them. In 2003, Johansson published Freuds psykoanalys. Band 3. Arvtagare i Sverige. Del 2 (Freud's Psychoanalysis. Vol 3. Heirs in Sweden Part 2). In this volume, Alfhild Tamm, Gunnar Nycander, Gösta Harding and Stefi Pedersen, likewise are given their own chapters.

Having thus described the reception of Freud and psychoanalysis from a Swedish perspective, Johansson devoted a fourth volume (2009) to the situation of psychiatry and clinical psychology in Gothenburg.

Together with the French psychoanalyst and historian Elisabeth Roudinesco, Johansson has introduced the Swedish psychoanalyst and researcher Ola Andersson in France. He has also critically read and introduced the Swedish translations of several texts by Sigmund Freud and Michel Foucault.

Psychoanalysis and the Humanities, a collection of essays, was published in 2014. Here, Johansson deals with the complex encounter between psychoanalysis and the humanities, elucidating the subject from a number of various perspectives, cultural, historical, theoretical, practical, and clinical as well as personal.

In June 2020, Johansson published a book with daily notes from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic:Corona. En psykoanalytikers dagbok.

The book Arkitektliv. Gert Wingårdh i samtal med Per Magnus Johansson och Johan Linton [Life of an Architect. Gert Wingårdh in conversation with Per Magnus Johansson and Johan Linton] was published in October 2021.

The Freudian Association in Gothenburg

In his hometown Gothenburg, Johansson has founded Freudianska föreningen (The Freudian Association), which arranges seminars and lectures. Johansson is founder, editor in chief, and publisher of Arche – a journal with an interest in psychoanalysis, the humanities, and architecture (previously Psykoanalytisk Tid/Skrift). In the journal, Johansson has published interviews with several French psychoanalysts, such as René Major, Elisabeth Roudinesco, Julia Kristeva, Roland Gori, Charles Melman, and Catherine Millot. Arche was in 2018 awarded the prize as cultural magazine of the year in Sweden.

Awards and honorary memberships

In 2006, Johansson was awarded the distinction Ordre des Palmes Académiques by the French Ministry of Education. On 26 March 2012, Johansson was elected honorary member of the Swedish Psychoanalytical Association, a constituent organization of the International Psychoanalytical Association. In 2014, Johansson was elected member of the Royal Society of Arts and Sciences in Gothenburg.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""John Moore, Baron Moore of Lower Marsh"", the article should at least have 250 words","John Edward Michael Moore, Baron Moore of Lower Marsh,  (26 November 1937 – 20 May 2019) was a British Conservative Party politician who was Member of Parliament for Croydon Central from February 1974 until 1992. During the Premiership of Margaret Thatcher he enjoyed a meteoric rise through the ranks of government, which culminated in his serving as a Secretary of State in the Cabinet from 1987 to 1989. For a time, he was considered a rising star of his party and a potential leadership contender.

Moore was particularly noted for his ""filmstar good looks"" and an American background. Moore's wife was American and he had lived for several years in the USA. He brought aspects of American corporate culture to government and was reported to speak with a slight American accent. His first political experience was as a Democratic Party organiser in Illinois during the early 1960s.

Moore's fortunes in government waned after 1987 when he was made responsible for the highly sensitive portfolios of health and social security. His earlier success had been as a facilitator of the Thatcher government's privatisation programme. In this capacity he became known as ""Mr Privatisation"". When Moore attempted to extend this concept into the management of the National Health Service and the wider provision of social services, he encountered opposition from all sides. After losing credibility he was effectively demoted in 1988 (through loss of the health portfolio) and then sacked from his cabinet post in 1989.

Moore left the House of Commons in 1992, subsequently holding a number of corporate directorships and chairmanships.

Early life
Moore was born in Kentish Town, London. His father was a factory worker who later became a publican. He attended the Licensed Victuallers' School in Slough, an independent school supported by his father's trade body. After leaving school, Moore undertook two years of National Service from 1955 to 1957. He served with the Royal Sussex Regiment in Korea and won a temporary commission.

He enrolled at the London School of Economics in 1958, and followed a three-year degree course. He was active in student politics, and held the position of President of the LSE Students' Union. During this time he met fellow student Sheila Tillotson. Moore accompanied Tillotson back to her native Chicago after the two had both completed their studies. Here the couple married in 1962 and Moore found work initially as a financial analyst with a Chicago investment bank. He became a stockbroker, and achieved a senior position at the Chicago office of the Dean Witter brokerage. Dean Witter catered to a mainly middle-class clientele, with the typical client holding only a modest portfolio of stock.

While in Chicago, Moore became a Democratic Party activist and served as a ""precinct captain"". In this capacity he gained experience of American political campaigning which he later applied in the UK. He was reportedly much impressed by President John F. Kennedy, and adopted him as a role model.

Moore returned to the UK in 1968, and took up an appointment in London as Chairman of Dean Witter (International). The Moores set up residence in the suburb of Wimbledon where their three children (one daughter and two sons) were born. Moore became active in local Conservative politics and was elected to serve as a Councillor in the London Borough of Merton in 1971. He initially gave the impression of being a liberal conservative. For example, he opposed the withdrawal of free school milk from the Borough's children which was happening as the result of the government budget cuts policy.

In October 1973, he was adopted as the prospective Conservative parliamentary candidate for the Croydon Central constituency. At this time he was described as being ""an investment banker and stockbroker, age 36"".

Early political career
Croydon Central was a new constituency, and was initially very marginally Conservative. Moore won the seat in the February 1974 general election by a majority of 1,300 votes over Labour. His majority was reduced to 164 in the October 1974 election. However, he was able to strengthen his position in the constituency; the last time he contested the seat (in the 1987 election) he achieved a majority of over 10,000. His wife, Sheila, acted as his constituency secretary, speech writer and political adviser. She combined her duties in this regard with studying for a law degree and acting as a local magistrate. Observers commented that Sheila was very much the driving force behind his rise in politics.

Moore projected the image of a young, vigorous politician. He would usually rise at 05:30 and be at his desk by 07:00. He was a member of the House of Commons football team and the House skiing team. It is reported that his wife ""... kept him on a strict regime of camomile tea, decaffeinated coffee and health food...."" He was frequently seen jogging in the early morning in the Westminster area, and was reported to spend 30 minutes each day on an exercise bicycle. Conservative MP Julian Critchley described him as being;

Handsome, with the sort of looks that would have appealed to J. Arthur Rank, personable and polite, he looks ten years younger than his 49 years.

Margaret Thatcher appointed Moore as one of five Conservative Party vice-chairmen in March 1975, shortly after she became Conservative leader. Moore's remit was ""youth"". He held this position until the Conservatives were returned to office in 1979, at which time he was appointed as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Energy. In this capacity, one of his main duties was responsibility for the nationalised British coal industry.

After the 1983 general election, Moore was appointed Economic Secretary to the Treasury under Chancellor Nigel Lawson. At the Treasury, Moore was charged with fronting government policy on privatisation. Most notably, he oversaw the privatisation of British Telecom in 1984 and that of several other major utilities supplying gas, electricity and water. The privatisation of state-owned industries was a major feature of the Thatcher governments. These privatisations were popularised by small parcels of shares in the privatised entities being made available to members of the public at deeply discounted prices. This promoted a form of popular capitalism along the lines of the Dean Witter business model. Moore gained an extremely high profile and became known as ""Mr Privatisation"".

Cabinet career
Moore joined Mrs Thatcher's Cabinet in 1986 as Secretary of State for Transport. His tenure of office at Transport was brief but coincided with the completion of major developments such as the M25 London orbital motorway and the privatisation of British Airways. The capsizing of the Herald of Free Enterprise car ferry outside Zeebrugge harbour on 6 March 1987 gave Moore considerable media exposure. These events served to raise Moore's profile even further and he played a prominent campaign role in the 1987 general election.

... what probably clinched his promotion to the DHSS yesterday was his TV performance in the party political broadcast that attacked the loony left. It was Thatcher herself who suggested that Moore be used on it. The broadcast was, according to one observer, considered ""sharp, nasty – and effective"".

By now, Moore was being widely spoken of as a future Prime Minister. The journalist Brian Walden wrote ""... he has future Tory leader written all over him"". After the 1987 election he was appointed as Secretary of State for Health and Social Services. In this capacity he was responsible for the National Health Service's £66 billion annual spend, and the payment of over £50 billion annually in the form of social security benefits. These were highly sensitive portfolios that were intended to be very much at the centre of policy initiatives in the 1987 government.

However, there were some early misgivings about the appointment. Describing Moore's earlier career in government, Julian Critchley said, ""The script had been written for him, and he had only to learn his lines"". Other commentators noted that his previous experience had been in implementing policy rather than in creating policy. In 2012 David Waddington, Mrs Thatcher's former Chief Whip and Home Secretary published a memoir of his time in government ('Dispatches') in which he reported that Thatcher had a weakness for ""a good-looking fellow"" when it came to making government appointments. ""Once or twice she ... wished to have some good-looking fellow promoted who was known to be useless. ...  He was a fine-looking chap but no else thought he was anything like up to the job."" Waddington declined to name the people he referred to but many commentators stated that Moore was one clear beneficiary of this personal foible.

Once established in his new job, Moore delivered a series of speeches on policy in the social services. These speeches appeared to indicate a move to a healthcare system based on private insurance, similar to the American model. Specific proposals included making private healthcare insurance contributions tax-deductible, and allowing nurses' wage rates to be established by local bargaining rather than by central negotiation. Moore quickly encountered opposition from various interest groups, including the Royal College of Physicians. Many Conservative backbench MPs had misgivings about what was being proposed. Furthermore, some of the speeches suggested that Moore was positioning himself to be leader of the Conservative Party. During a visit to the USA in October 1987, he delivered a speech to the Mont Pelerin Society in which he appeared to suggest that he had been the prime mover behind privatisation in the UK. This displeased his fellow Ministers and other senior Party figures.

Moore did not seem to engage comfortably in the public estimate procedures by which departmental spending budgets were set. The then Chief Secretary to the Treasury, John Major, was reported to have found Moore to be ""a soft touch"". The then Health Minister, Edwina Currie, is reported to have described Moore as being ""useless"". An entry in her diary dated January 1988 reads: ""It became apparent during the first ten days ... that Moore just didn't know what to do"". Moore found difficulties in his relationships with senior civil servants. Not all the latter were comfortable with a working day that started at 07:00. Moore's wife (and political adviser), Sheila, had clashes with civil servants, and Moore was privately warned that she did not understand the British way of doing things. It is believed that Sheila may have drafted some of Moore's more controversial speeches.

A 1987 Cabinet Office memo written by Moore stated that the Government had adopted a Policy of not accepting any direct responsibility for the Contaminated Blood Scandal. It was unearthed and made public in 2017 with many of those affected by the scandal alleging a cover-up.

In November 1987, Moore was struck down with bacterial pneumonia. He initially tried to ignore the illness and attended a cabinet meeting before he had recovered. During the meeting he became unconscious. He was subsequently admitted to the Parkside Hospital in Wimbledon. The fact that this was a private clinic owned by a German healthcare company (reportedly charging patients up to £2,000 per day) attracted bad publicity. Union leader Rodney Bickerstaffe stated ""How can a social services secretary claim to care about the National Health Service when he does not even trust his own health care to an NHS hospital?"".

End of political career
After two months' absence due to illness, Moore returned to work. But by now his political prospects were much diminished. The Department of Health and Social Security was split into two separate ministries, with Kenneth Clarke becoming Secretary of State for Health on 25 July 1988. Moore remained in the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Social Security for a further year. However, his credibility was further damaged by speeches in which he appeared to suggest that poverty had been abolished in modern Britain. His attempt to target state assistance towards poorer families while freezing child benefits provoked a major rebellion by Conservative backbench MPs.

Moore was sacked from the cabinet in July 1989. Most commentators at the time considered him to have been a weak politician who had been promoted beyond his ability.

He was written off by one Tory as 'like a frightened rabbit mesmerised by oncoming headlights'.

He gave up his parliamentary seat at the time of the 1992 general election. After leaving government Moore held a number of directorships with large concerns, including Credit Suisse Asset Management and Rolls Royce. In 2010 he retired as Chairman of the Monitor Group.

After leaving the Commons in 1992, Moore became a life peer as Baron Moore of Lower Marsh, of Lower Marsh in the London Borough of Lambeth. A BBC feature in August 2011 reported that after 20 years in the House of Lords, Moore had still to make his maiden speech. Between his sacking from the Cabinet in 1989 and stepping down from the House of Commons in 1992 his only contributions were in two transport debates.

While he worked behind the scenes as a political operator he was very effective ... but he was suddenly thrust into the spotlight in the mammoth task of defending the government on the issues of health and social security ... and he just bombed

20th-century English businesspeople"," John Moore, Baron Moore of Lower Marsh was an English businessman, politician, and philanthropist. Born in Marylebone, London, the son of a leather factor, Moore was initially employed as a clerk by the London and County Banking Company, before becoming a partner in the firm of John Jones and Co., Factors and Commission Agents, and then setting up his own business as a commission agent, John Moore and Co., in 1842. In 1860, he took his brother, William, into partnership, and the firm was renamed John Moore and Brothers. The firm was a great success, and the business expanded to include estate agency, and, in 1889, it was floated on the London Stock Exchange as Moore and Sons, Limited. The firm was a large employer in the Marylebone area, and also had offices in Paris and Milan. In 1871, Moore bought the estate of Marylebone from the Duke of Portland for £250,000. In addition to his business interests, Moore was also a property developer, and the next twenty years saw the rapid development of the area, with many of the fine houses in the Portland Place and Wimpole Street areas being built during this period. Politically, Moore was a Liberal, and in 1880 he was elected as one of the first London County councillors for the Marylebone East division. In 1885, he was elected to the House of Commons as one of the two members for Marylebone West, and he held the seat until he was defeated in 1900. In 1898, he was raised to the peerage as Baron Moore of Lower Marsh, in the County of London. Lord Moore was also a generous philanthropist, and gave large sums of money for the benefit of his employees and the local community. He provided a hospital and an infirmary for his staff, and also contributed towards the cost of building a new church in nearby St John's Wood, where many of his employees lived. He also funded the building of a large public hall in Marylebone, which was named after him. Lord Moore died in April 1911, aged 75. He is buried in the eastern section of Highgate Cemetery.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,462031,0.12258494337108597,0.12631578947368421,0.2465197943229798,0.3115264797507788,8,13,0,1,14,0,0,0,0,1,0.16544618721076396,0.0440626509586052,0.014913007456503728,0.052825552825552825,17,1,8,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,25,1,33,1,1,1
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Agriculture in the Philippines"", the article should at least have 250 words","Agriculture in the Philippines is an important part of the economy of the Philippines with crops like rice, coconut and sugar dominating the production of crops and exports. It employs 23% of the Filipino workforce , according to the World Bank.

The Philippines is one of the most vulnerable agricultural systems to monsoons and other extreme weather events, which are expected to create more uncertainty as climate change effects the Philippines. However, the Food and Agriculture Organization has described the local policy measures as some of the most proactive in risk reduction.

Rice 

The Philippines is the 8th largest rice producer in the world, accounting for 2.8% of global rice production. The Philippines was also the world's largest rice importer in 2010. In 2010, nearly 15.7 million metric tons of palay (pre-husked rice) were produced. In 2010, palay accounted for 21.86% percent of gross value added in agriculture and 2.37% of GNP. Self-sufficiency in rice reached 88.93% in 2015.

Rice production in the Philippines has grown significantly since the 1950s. Improved varieties of rice developed during the Green Revolution, including at the International Rice Research Institute based in the Philippines have improved crop yields. Crop yields have also improved due to increased use of fertilizers. Average productivity increased from 1.23 metric tons per hectare in 1961 to 3.59 metric tons per hectare in 2009.

Harvest yields have increased significantly by using foliar fertilizer (Rc 62 -> 27% increase, Rc 80 -> 40% increase, Rc 64 -> 86% increase) based on PhilRice National Averages.

The government has been promoting the production of Golden rice.

The table below shows some of the agricultural products of the country per region.

Corn/maize

Corn/maize is the second most important crop in the Philippines.  600,000 farm households are employed in different businesses in the corn value chain. , around  of land is under corn cultivation and the total production was . The government has been promoting Bt corn for hardiness against insects and higher yields.

Other food crops

Chocolate

Coffee

Coconuts 

Coconuts plays an important role in the national economy of the Philippines. According to figures published in December 2015 by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, it is the world's largest producer of coconuts, producing 19,500,000 tonnes in 2015. Production in the Philippines is generally concentrated in medium-sized farms. There are 3.5 million hectares dedicated to coconut production in the Philippines, which accounts for 25 per cent of total agricultural land in the country. In 1989, it was estimated that between 25 percent and 33 percent of the population was at least partly dependent on coconuts for their livelihood. Historically, the Southern Tagalog and Bicol regions of Luzon and the Eastern Visayas were the centers of coconut production. In the 1980s, Western Mindanao and Southern Mindanao also became important coconut-growing regions.

Fruits

The Philippines is the world's third largest producer of pineapples, producing more than 2.4 million of tonnes in 2015. The Philippines was in the top three banana producing countries in 2010, including India and China. Davao and Mindanao contribute heavily to the total national banana crop. Mangoes are the third most important fruit crop of the country based on export volume and value next to bananas and pineapples.

Sugar 

There are at least 19 provinces and 11 regions that produce sugarcane in the Philippines. A range from 360,000 to 390,000 hectares are devoted to sugarcane production. The largest sugarcane areas are found in the Negros Island Region, which accounts for 51% of sugarcane areas planted. This is followed by Mindanao which accounts for 20%; Luzon by 17%; Panay by 07%; and Eastern Visayas by 04%. It is estimated that , the industry provides direct employment to 700,000 sugarcane workers spread across 19 sugar producing provinces.

Sugar growing in the Philippines pre-dates colonial Spanish contact. Sugar became the most important agricultural export of the Philippines between the late eighteenth century and the mid-1970s. During the 1950s and 60s, more than 20 percent income of Philippine exports came from the sugar industry. Between 1913 and 1974, the Philippines sugar industry enjoyed favoured terms of trade with the US, with special access to the protected and subsidized the American sugar market.

Abaca 

According to the Philippine Fiber Industry Development Authority, the Philippines provided 87.4% of the world's abaca in 2014, earning the Philippines US$111.33 million.  The demand is still greater than the supply.  The remainder came from Ecuador (12.5%) and Costa Rica (0.1%).  The Bicol region in the Philippines produced 27,885 metric tons of abaca in 2014, the largest of any Philippine region.  The Philippine Rural Development Program (PRDP) and the Department of Agriculture reported that in 2009–2013, Bicol Region had 39% share of Philippine abaca production while overwhelming 92% comes from Catanduanes Island. Eastern Visayas, the second largest producer had 24% and the Davao Region, the third largest producer had 11% of the total production.  Around 42 percent of the total abaca fiber shipments from the Philippines went to the United Kingdom in 2014, making it the top importer.  Germany imported 37.1 percent abaca pulp from the Philippines, importing around 7,755 metric tons (MT).  Sales of abaca cordage surged 20 percent in 2014 to a total of 5,093 MT from 4,240 MT, with the United States holding around 68 percent of the market.

Rubber

There are an estimated 458,000 families dependent upon the cultivation of rubber trees. Rubber is mainly planted in Mindanao, with some plantings in Luzon and the Visayas. , the total rubber production is 111,204 tons.

External links"," Agriculture in the Philippines Agriculture is an important sector in the Philippine economy. In 2018, the sector contributed an estimated 6.4% to the country's GDP. Agriculture is also a major source of employment. In 2016, the sector employed over 30% of the country's population. The importance of agriculture in the Philippines has been declining over the past few decades, as the country has been transitioning to a more industrialized and service-oriented economy. However, the sector continues to play a key role in the country's economy and development. The agricultural sector in the Philippines is composed of two sub-sectors: crop agriculture and animal husbandry. Crops are the major source of income for most farmers, while animal husbandry is a secondary source of income for many farmers. The country's agricultural land area is approximately 30 million hectares, which is about 30% of the country's total land area. The country's main crops include rice, coconut, sugar, bananas, pineapple, mango, and vegetables. The country's main livestock include pigs, cattle, goats, sheep, and poultry. The agricultural sector in the Philippines is facing a number of challenges, including the effects of climate change, such as extreme weather events and rising sea levels, which are damaging crops and livestock. The sector is also struggling to adapt to the country's rapidly changing demographics, as the population has been increasing and becoming more urbanized. In addition, the sector is facing competition from imports, which have been flooding the country's markets and driving down prices. Despite these challenges, the agricultural sector in the Philippines is showing signs of resilience. The sector is adapting to the changing demographics by shifting to higher-value crops and livestock, such as fruits, vegetables, and fish. The sector is also investing in new technologies and techniques to increase productivity and adapt to climate change. The government is also supporting the sector through various programs and initiatives.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,15948510,0.047016274864376144,0.15789473684210525,0.09204836289824377,0.2367601246105919,3,4,1,0,4,0,1,1,0,1,0.06800025591192409,0.019039212356560413,0.0022093344380005524,0.018427518427518427,30,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,11,1,36,0,1,1

Gracián was born in Milan to a noble family, the son of Carlo Gracián and his wife Lucrezia Tomacelli. His uncle, Antonio Gracián, was a cardinal. After his parents' deaths, he and his brother Carlo were raised by their uncle. He studied at the Jesuit college in Milan and then at the Collegium Germanicum in Rome, where he was admitted to the Society of Jesus on 8 November 1570. After completing his studies, Gracián taught at Milan and Piacenza. He was a leading figure in the Jesuit congregation in Milan, and was held in high regard by his penitents. In 1587, Gracián was made cardinal by Pope Sixtus V. He was not a bishop, as was customary, but Sixtus V wanted a Jesuit at the Roman Curia to counterbalance the influence of the Dominicans. As a cardinal, Gracián lived in Rome, but spent much of his time in Milan, where he had his residence, and where he died. Gracián was a friend of Carlo Borromeo, who was influential in the Counter-Reformation. He was a patron of the arts and a collector of books and manuscripts. He is best known for his work on the topic of love, which he described as a ""divine plague"".

West Haven has 660 parking spaces in on-site lots (with the possibility of 300–400 more in a parking garage in a refurbished industrial building north of the station if warranted by future demand) as well as bicycle facilities. The station is accessible. West Haven has full service on the New Haven Line, as well as from the handful of Shore Line East trains which run past New Haven to Stamford.

After a decade of studies, planning, and controversy over the station site, ground was broken for the station on November 10, 2010.  The $80 million project included the station, with two 12-car platforms, a glass station building, and an overhead pedestrian bridge, as well as the restoration of the formerly abandoned fourth mainline track through the station. It is only the second new station on the line in a century, after  in 2011. The station opened to passengers on August 18, 2013.

Shore Line East service at the station was suspended indefinitely on March 16, 2020, due to the coronavirus pandemic.

History

Original stations

During the 19th and early 20th centuries, a station stop was located in West Haven between Washington and Campbell Avenues, about  east of the modern station. The first West Haven station, at Washington Avenue, opened along with the rest of the New York and New Haven Railroad on December 25, 1848. The wood-framed building, located on the south (eastbound) side of the tracks, was moved west halfway to Campbell Avenue in 1895 when the line was quadruple-tracked. At that time, a second station was built on the westbound side across from the older station. The first station burned down on February 26, 1914, and was replaced by a new building by the middle of 1915. As trains grew longer and heavier, closely spaced village stops were retired in favor of more widely spaced downtown stations. West Haven closed in the mid-1920s, though the eastbound station building was not demolished until the 1940s. The station was briefly proposed to reopen in the 1950s following the construction of a Veterans Affairs hospital nearby; however, this did not come to fruition, and the idea was largely abandoned for several decades.

A short-lived station was also located at Front Avenue in West Haven on the New Haven and Derby Railroad. The station was at street level, with stairs to the platform on the elevated tracks. The station opened in 1871 and was closed by 1914.

Planning for a new station
In the late 1990s, Metro-North began considering adding a station in either West Haven or neighboring Orange to fill the  gap between the  and  stations—the longest such gap on the New Haven mainline. Both town governments were supportive of a station, which was then to cost $25–30 million. Support in West Haven was largely rallied by the West Haven Train Station Committee Inc., which circulated a petition eventually signed by 7600 residents. Support in Orange was both local by the Orange Railroad Committee and also aided by several employers, including Bayer Pharmaceuticals, whose employees were likely to use the station. In fall 2001, a site study and a regional transportation committee recommended the Orange site (at Marsh Hill Road) based on cost, time considerations, and highway access. However, in December 2001, the South Central Council of Governments voted instead to support the West Haven site, citing the economic needs of West Haven versus comparatively wealthy Orange.

Orange's first selectman originally planned to appeal the decision, and controversy continued. The sustained bitter animosity between the two towns was cited in a study of bargaining between municipalities. The Final Environmental Impact Statement, issued in June 2007, considered both station sites, noting that ""The recommendation of the West Haven site does not preclude the construction of a commuter railroad station at the Orange site in the future, as the demand for additional parking and service warrants, and as additional funding becomes available."" In 2011 - even after ground was broken at West Haven - state lawmakers considered a funding deal to build an Orange station.

Design and funding

In February 2005, the City of West Haven released a proposal for the West Haven station that modified the state's current plan, with less land taking adjacent to the station and a pedestrian bridge across Saw Mill Road to a 629-space garage in the Armonstrong North building. The city's proposal also included transit-oriented development, with a 325-unit residential development on the Armstrong South property and mixed-use buildings along Hood Terrace and Railroad Avenue. On June 19, 2006, West Haven Mayor John M. Picard and U.S. Representative Rosa L. DeLauro announced that DeLauro had secured $1.2 million in federal funding for the project, which brought the federal funding commitment as of that date to $3.2 million. The Final Environmental Impact Statement, released in June 2007, estimated the capital cost for the station at $66.56 million including land acquisitions, with a total of 1,074 parking spaces split between lots and a garage. Ridership was estimated at 1,620 daily riders at opening and 1,955 by 2025, with about 20% new transit users rather than diverted from New Haven or Milford stations.

Design was one-third complete and construction planned for fall 2009 when initial renderings were released in June 2008, with costs estimated at $100 million. The State Bond Commission authorized a $103 million bond for station construction in 2009.

Construction

About  of Track 4 - the southbound outside track - was taken out of service for passenger trains in the mid-1980s to reduce maintenance costs. The track was removed entirely between Devon and Woodmont, and reduced to freight use only between Woodmont and New Haven. The West Haven station project involved restoration of the New Haven Line's original configuration of 4 electrified main tracks in the  stretch from New Haven to Woodmont, leaving Woodmont to Devon as the only remaining triple-track section of the New Haven Line. The fourth track allows Metro-North local trains to stay exclusively on the outer tracks, leaving the inner tracks for passing Amtrak service and Metro-North expresses. The track restoration and re-electrification represented $33.68 million of the project cost. The restoration used new material, while the old rails and ties were reconditioned for use elsewhere in the state on freight-only and museum trackage.

Groundbreaking was held on November 10, 2010, with the presence of outgoing Governor Jodi Rell. At the time, the station was expected to cost $118 million and open by the end of 2012. After a year of site preparation and foundation work, construction began in earnest in early 2012. In April 2012, the state announced that the station was coming in under budget, with a cost of $80 million plus $25 million in previous property acquisition and design work. The majority of station and building construction was completed by the end of 2012, with primarily electrical, interior finishing, and paving work remaining. In March 2013, as the station neared completion, some of the original station advocates began pushing to use money left over from construction to build a parking garage at the site.

In February 2013, Metro-North proposed to include West Haven in the same fare zone as New Haven Union Station and State Street station. The station was originally to open on June 1, 2013, but these plans were derailed by construction delays and the death of a track worker who was struck by a train in late May. The station ultimately opened on August 18, 2013, with a formal ribbon-cutting the next day.

Platforms and tracks
The station has two high-level side platforms which can accommodate 12-car trains. The northern platform, adjacent to Track 3, is generally used by westbound trains. The southern platform, adjacent to Track 4, is generally used by eastbound trains. Amtrak's Northeast Corridor services do not stop at the station and utilize all four tracks to pass through.

West Haven station is served by several bus routes of CT Transit's New Haven Division. The 265B and 265R routes stop directly at the station on Saw Mill Road, and the 265R and 271R routes stop on Main Street about  south of the station. The 265S, 271M, and 271S routes run to West Haven proper, about a  east of the station.

The station is located off the Boston Post Road (U.S. 1) near the junction with Route 162 (Davenport Avenue). It is the westernmost transit station in Connecticut and the last before the New York border. The New Haven Line has two tracks at the station, with one island platform between the tracks. The Shore Line East has two tracks, with one platform on the north side of the tracks. The station, which opened in 1907, is the second-busiest on the New Haven Line, after Stamford. A project to add a third track to the New Haven Line at the station was completed in June 2012. In 2013, the West Haven city government proposed to build a pedestrian bridge over the tracks to connect the station to the downtown area. In 2015, the state government proposed to close the station's waiting room and replace it with a smaller waiting area in a new location. The proposal met with local opposition, and the waiting room was instead renovated. The station is 18.8 miles (30.3 km) from New Haven and 51.4 miles (82.0 km) from New York City.

In enzymology, a malate dehydrogenase (NADP+) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(S)-malate + NADP+  oxaloacetate + NADPH + H+

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (S)-malate and NADP+, whereas its 3 products are oxaloacetate, NADPH, and H+.

This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (S)-malate:NADP+ oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include NADP+-malic enzyme, NADP+-malate dehydrogenase, malic dehydrogenase (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate), malate NADP+ dehydrogenase, NADP+ malate dehydrogenase, NADP+-linked malate dehydrogenase, and malate dehydrogenase (NADP+). This enzyme participates in pyruvate metabolism and carbon fixation. This enzyme has at least one effector, hn.

EC 1.1.1
NADPH-dependent enzymes
Enzymes of known structure"," Malate dehydrogenase (NADP+) Malate dehydrogenase (MDH) is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of malate into oxaloacetate using NADP+ as a cofactor. This enzyme, along with its substrate and cofactor, is involved in the citric acid cycle, specifically in the reduction of oxaloacetate to malate. This reduction is necessary in order to maintain the balance of the cycle, as the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA results in the production of oxaloacetate. The enzyme is found in the cytosol of mesophyll cells in plants, and in the sarcoplasm of skeletal muscle in animals. In plant cells, MDH is involved in the anaplerotic reaction which produces oxaloacetate from acetyl-CoA. This reaction is part of the glyoxylate bypass, which allows the formation of glucose from carbon dioxide in the absence of a functional glycolytic pathway. In animals, the MDH found in skeletal muscle is involved in the breakdown of glucose to produce lactate, which is necessary for the contractile function of muscles. This breakdown is known as glycolysis, and the energy released is used to fuel the movements of the body. The enzyme is a homodimer, meaning it is composed of two identical subunits. Each subunit has a molecular weight of approximately 37 kDa. It is also a membrane-associated protein, meaning that it is bound to the plasma membrane of the cell. In the plant enzyme, this binding is via a transit peptide, which is a short amino acid sequence that directs the enzyme to the plasma membrane. In the animal enzyme, however, the binding is more loosely defined, and the enzyme may also be found in the cytosol. The primary structure of malate dehydrogenase is very similar across species, although there are some differences. The enzyme is a decamer, meaning it is composed of ten amino acid chains. The primary sequence of these chains is as follows, with the bold letters representing the amino acids that are identical to the consensus sequence: [A]-[B]-[C]-[D]-[E]-[F]-[G]-[H]-[I]-[J] The secondary structure of the enzyme is also similar across species, although the loops of the protein are usually different. The secondary structure of the enzyme is as follows: The active site of the enzyme is located at the C-terminal end, and it is here that the substrate binds to the enzyme. The active site contains a large number of negatively-charged amino acids, which are necessary for the binding of the positively-charged substrate. The enzyme is activated by the binding of NADP+, which is the cofactor for the reaction. This binding results in the formation of a complex between the enzyme and the cofactor. The complex is then able to bind to the substrate and catalyze the conversion of malate into oxaloacetate. The enzyme is also regulated by the levels of the substrate and the cofactor in the cell. In plants, the enzyme is typically activated by the increase in light intensity, which results in the increase in the levels of carbon dioxide in the cell. In animals, the enzyme is typically activated by the increase in the levels of lactate in the cell.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,13901061,0.015189873417721522,0.22105263157894736,0.057876621657400054,0.5404984423676013,5,4,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0.049861384504011,0.04410110698265173,0.00428058547362607,0.08108108108108109,5,0,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3,1,10,1,1,1
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Great Western Highway"", the article should at least have 250 words","The Great Western Highway is a  state highway in New South Wales, Australia. From east to west, the highway links Sydney with Bathurst, on the state's Central Tablelands.

Route
The eastern terminus of the Great Western Highway is at Railway Square, at the intersection of Broadway with Quay Street, in the inner-city suburb of Haymarket and just south of the Sydney CBD. From Railway Square, the Great Western Highway follows Broadway south and west. At the western end of Broadway, it branches south-west into City Road (Princes Highway). The Great Western Highway proceeds west from this junction and its local name changes to Parramatta Road and heads generally west towards Parramatta. Hume Highway (Liverpool Road) branches south-west at Summer Hill/Ashfield, and a short distance further west the majority of traffic is diverted off the highway and onto the M4 Western Motorway via the WestConnex tunnel at Ashfield. A short distance further west, still at Ashfield, the A4 arterial road ends at a major junction with the Great Western Highway (Parramatta Road) and Frederick Street (which proceeds south to join Hume Highway).

The highway continues west as Parramatta Road, with a major intersection at Homebush West with the A3 arterial road. Although the A3 road is called ""Centenary Drive"" in this area, the on-/off-ramps are separately named Marlborough Road, carrying on the name of the surface road that was replaced by Centenary Drive. Further west, on the boundary between Lidcombe and Auburn, the highway intersects the A6 arterial road (St Hillier's Road / Silverwater Road). 

Just south of Parramatta, the highway meets Woodville Road and continues west onto an on-ramp for the M4 Western Motorway, while the highway-designated route turns sharply to the north along Church Street, before turning again at the southern fringe of the Parramatta central business district, and then continues due west across western metropolitan Sydney to , north of the central business district, where it crosses the Nepean River via the 1867 Victoria Bridge. At , the M4 Western Motorway reconnects with the Great Western Highway and the highway ascends the Blue Mountains. It intersects at Mount Victoria with the Darling Causeway which heads north to connect with the Bells Line of Road. From Mount Victoria, the highway descends via Victoria Pass into the Hartley Valley and then passes through the western suburbs of Lithgow where it is joined by the Chifley Road, which links eastward back to the Bells Line of Road. The highway continues generally west, intersecting with the Castlereagh Highway west of Marrangaroo, and crosses Coxs River to ascend the Great Dividing Range to reach its highest point (at  just east of Yetholme) and over the western ridge of the Sydney basin before dropping into the Macquarie Valley to reach its western terminus at Bathurst, at the junction of the Mitchell Highway and the Mid-Western Highway.

At numerous points along its journey, the highway transverses or is transversed by the Main Western railway line. Major river crossings occur east of Emu Plains (Nepean), near Wallerawang (Coxs), and east of Bathurst (Macquarie).

It consists of two of Australia's most historic roads – Parramatta Road, and the full length of the former Great Western Road, from Parramatta to Bathurst.

History

Colonial establishment

Sydney CBD to Parramatta and Penrith

Initial travel between Sydney and the settlement of Parramatta was by water along the Parramatta River. Sometime between 1789 and 1791 an overland track was made to provide an official land route between the two settlements. Parramatta Road dates to the 1792 formation of a route linking Sydney to the settlement of Parramatta, formalised under the direction of Surveyor-General Augustus Alt in 1797. Parramatta Road became one of the colony's most important early roadways, and for many years remained one of Sydney's premier thoroughfares. By 1810, Parramatta Road had officially open to traffic and was financed during a large portion of the 1800s by a toll, with toll booths located at what now is Sydney University and the Duck River.

From Parramatta to Penrith, a road along the current alignment of the Great Western Highway (except at  and Penrith) was constructed soon after completion of the Sydney-Parramatta Road.

Emu Plains to Mount Victoria

In 1813, acting on the instructions of Governor of New South Wales Lachlan Macquarie, Gregory Blaxland, William Lawson and William Wentworth led an 1813 expedition that travelled west from Emu Plains and, by staying to the ridges, were able to confirm the existence of a passable route directly west from Sydney across the Blue Mountains. The existence of other, less direct routes had been known as far back as 1797, but due to the need to prevent convicts from believing that escape from the hemmed-in Sydney region was possible, knowledge of the expeditions confirming the existence of routes across the Blue Mountains was suppressed. Blaxland, Lawson and Wentworth travelled as far west as the point they named Mount Blaxland,  southwest of where Lithgow now stands. From this point they were able to see that the worst of the almost impenetrable terrain of the Blue Mountains was behind them, and that there were easy routes available to reach the rolling countryside they could see off to the west.

Mount Victoria to Bathurst

Macquarie then despatched Surveyor George Evans to follow Blaxland, Lawson and Wentworth's route and to push further west until he reached arable land. Evans travelled west until he reached the Fish River, and followed it downstream until he reached the site of Bathurst. Within a year, Macquarie commissioned William Cox to construct a road west from Emu Plains, following Evans' route, and this road was finished in 1815. Macquarie himself travelled across it soon after completion, established and named Bathurst, and named the road the Great Western Road.

The section of the Great Western Road as far west as , with a small number of minor deviations, is still in use today as part of the Great Western Highway. West of Mount Victoria, Evans' route has been superseded, chiefly by Mitchell's new route constructed between 1832 and 1836.

Route development
Between present-day  and Dog Trap Road (now Woodville Road), Parramatta Road travelled in a wide arc up to  south of the present route, to avoid marshy areas around Haslams Creek and Duck River. Continuing due west from Flemington, it crossed Duck River near the present Mona Street bridge, turning north near the present Granville Park to finish at George Street in Parramatta, between Pitt and Church Streets. This was deviated circa 1840 to follow the present route. Few traces of the original route remain.

At Mount Victoria, at the western edge of the Blue Mountains, the route of Cox's road turned north to Mount York, from where it descended into the Hartley Valley. This pass was the major piece of engineering on the original route, and when Macquarie travelled the new road in 1815, he named it Cox's Pass in honour of the builder. From the foot of Mount York the road resumed its westerly direction to where  now stands. However, from here it ran via the present-day Glenroy, Mount Blaxland, Cut Hill Road, Pitts Corner, Phils Falls, Mount Olive Rd, Carlwood Road and Sidmouth Valley to a point  south of . From here it continued westward, not crossing the Fish River, but crossing Campbells River  north of the present bridge at The Lagoon and ascending to another ridgeline where it turned north to Gormans Hill, to reach the future site of Bathurst from the south, not the east.

For the first one hundred years after this ceased to be the route of the Great Western Road it remained trafficable, but the destruction of the bridge at Phil's Falls on the Fish River in 1930 meant it was no longer a through route, and parts became untrafficable. However, most of this route remains in existence as a series of local roads.

The original route had only been in existence for eight years when, in 1823, Assistant Surveyor James McBrian identified an improved route on the approaches to Bathurst. This route turned north  south of O'Connell to run northwest to where  is now located, then west across the Macquarie River into Bathurst. The section from south of O'Connell to Kelso is now part of the Bathurst-Oberon Road, and from Kelso into central Bathurst still remains as part of the Great Western Highway.

When Major Thomas Mitchell was appointed as Surveyor-General in 1828, one of the first matters to which he turned his attention was the improvement of the Great Western Road. Mitchell's attention was focussed on providing a more direct and easily graded route for the Great Western Road. To this end, he surveyed a route running northwest from Hartley via Mt Walker to Meadow Flat, crossing the Great Dividing Range at Mount Lambie, then running in an almost straight line westward via Browns Hill to Kelso, to meet the pre-existing road. This road remains in existence – from Mount Lambie west it remains as the route of the current Highway (with deviations) but the section adjacent to Cox's River was inundated by the construction of Lake Lyell for Wallerawang Power Station in the late 1970s.

Mitchell was also concerned to improve the worst sections of the road, which were the climb from the Cumberland Plain, on which Sydney sits, and the descent of Mount York, down the western side of the Blue Mountains.

In improving the eastern ascent Mitchell adhered largely to Cox's route, which follows the southern side of an east-falling gully to reach the plateau at where  is now located. However, he engaged Scottish engineer David Lennox to build a stone arch bridge, now the Lennox Bridge, across the mouth of a particularly deep side gully. This route, known as Mitchell's Pass, was completed in 1833 and superseded what is now called Old Bathurst Road, located to the north of the route. The Mitchell's Pass and Lennox Bridge served as the main route to the Blue Mountains for 93 years until 1926, when the Great Western Highway was re-routed via sections of the former Lapstone Zig Zag including the Knapsack Viaduct.

After protracted arguments first with Governor Ralph Darling and then his successor Richard Bourke, and ignoring orders, Mitchell surveyed, designed and had built what is now known as Victoria Pass, where the highway drops from the Blue Mountains into the Hartley Valley. Midway down the road had to be supported on a causeway formed by massive stone buttressed walls, where a narrow ridge connects two large bluffs. This ridge had to be widened and raised to give the highway a route from the upper to the lower bluff. Mitchell cut terraces into the sides of these bluffs to form a passage for the road. It is a testimony of Mitchell's vision and engineering skill that this route, almost unchanged, and using his 1832 stonework, is still in use. Because this pass brought the road into the Hartley Valley several kilometres south of the Mount York descent, it necessitated a new route as far west as Hartley to meet Cox's Road. This also is still in use as part of the highway.

In 1929 the Main Roads Board deviated the route north from Old Bowenfels to Marrangaroo, using trunk road 55 (Mudgee Road). From Marrangaroo a new road was built westward, running south of Wallerawang to meet Mitchell's 1830 deviation immediately east of Mount Lambie. This route avoids the long, steep gradients either side of Cox's River, which were the main drawback of Mitchell's route.

The Great Western Highway today therefore consists of Parramatta Road to Parramatta, the Great Western Road to Emu Plains, Coxs Road to Hartley (other than Mitchell's deviations at  and Mount York), Mitchell's route from Hartley to Old Bowenfels, the Main Roads Board route from Old Bowenfels to Mount Lambie, Mitchell's road from Mount Lambie to Kelso, and McBrian's road from Kelso to central Bathurst.

Improvements

Early improvements
The first recorded major improvement to the route of the Great Western Highway was the construction in 1806 of ten bridges along Parramatta Road.

In attempts to improve the gradient of the descent from the Blue Mountains plateau to the floor of the Hartley Valley, Lawson's Long Alley was opened in 1824. This still did not prove satisfactory and construction of a second deviation, known as Lockyer's Pass, was commenced. However this route was not completed, as its construction was abandoned in favour of construction of Mitchell's route via Victoria Pass.

Originally the Great Western Road crossed the Nepean River at Penrith by means of a ferry adjacent to the Log Cabin Hotel. This was superseded in 1856 by a bridge which was destroyed by a flood in 1857. A second bridge was opened in 1860, and was destroyed by the record flood of 1867. In the same year a new bridge, Victoria Bridge, was nearing completion adjacent to the road crossing, as part of the Penrith-Weatherboard (Wentworth Falls) section of the Main Western Railway. Its deck was modified to accommodate road traffic as well as the single-track railway. This bridge continued in dual use until 1907 when the current steel truss railway bridge was built alongside, and the 1867 bridge was given over solely to road traffic. This bridge remains in use for the Great Western Highway. The design of this bridge is almost identical to that of the 1863 Menangle Railway Bridge, also over the Nepean River.

In 1870 the Denison Bridge, a wrought iron truss bridge, was built across the Macquarie River at Bathurst. This replaced an earlier wooden bridge.

Early 20th Century improvements
In the first few years of the 20th century the railway overpasses between Lapstone Hill and Mount Victoria were replaced as part of the duplication of the Main Western railway. These bridges were of brick arch construction. They were in turn replaced in the mid-1950s to obtain the necessary height clearances for overhead wiring for the electrification of the Main Western Railway from Penrith to Bowenfels.

In 1912 Victoria Pass was superseded by Berghofers Pass, which followed a similar route to Victoria Pass, but below it. It was more winding and thus longer, thereby affording a less steep climb. However rapid improvements in motor vehicle performance meant that in 1920 Victoria Pass was rebuilt to become the main route again.

After the ascent of the eastern escarpment by the Main Western Railway was deviated for the second time in 1913 to its current route via Glenbrook Gorge, the Great Western Road was also deviated at this point for a second time in 1926 by the then Main Roads Board, which rerouted it via the disused 1867 stone arch railway viaduct across Knapsack Gully and around the southern side of Lapstone Hill to gain the first plateau in the ascent of the Blue Mountains. As this viaduct had held only a single railway track, its deck was widened in 1939 to its present two lane configuration. The viaduct was closed to motor traffic when the M4 motorway was extended west from Russell Street to connect to the Highway at Lapstone in 1994.

West of Knapsack Gully, although now widened to four lanes, the 1926 route of the highway is still in use. It uses a long stretch of abandoned railway formation – the section from Zig Zag Street to Blaxland station is located on the original 1867 railway alignment. An indication of the need to divert the railway can be gained from the gradient of the highway as it climbs west from Hare St to Lovett Street.

A number of deviations were built in 1929:
 at Haslams Creek, , to straighten the road and provide a new bridge
 between  and , to remove an underpass and an overpass of the railway from the route of the highway
 at Eusdale, Yetholme (in three sections) and Melrose (all west of Meadow Flat), to ease gradients.

In 1930 the level crossing at Bowenfels was replaced by an underpass.

Victoria Pass was upgraded in 1932 to give a constant width of 8.5 m, with a minor deviation built at the foot of the pass.

Upgrading since World War II
In 1957 a short deviation immediately west of Linden eliminated two narrow overpasses of the railway, both of which had right angle bend approaches from both directions. These bridges would have had to have been replaced in any event to allow for overhead wiring for the electrification to Bowenfels of the Main Western Railway. Such replacements occurred east of Linden, further west of Linden near Bull's Camp, east of Lawson, at Medlow Bath and east of Mount Victoria, and in these cases the replacement bridges were located at a skew angle to eliminate right angle bend approaches, with the earlier bridges left for pedestrian use.

In 1958 the 'Forty Bends’, where the Highway runs along the foot of Hassans Walls approaching Lithgow, were eased. The fact that this section of the Highway is on the southern side of a very high escarpment poses severe ice problems during winter, due to the lack of sunlight.

In the early 1960s the highway was deviated east of Leura to cross under the railway at Scott Parade (which was itself part of the former highway route) and run along the north side of the railway to rejoin the previous route at Leura Mall.

In 1967, the highway was deviated to bypass Springwood shopping centre, eliminating two narrow underpasses of the railway from the highway route. The previous route remain in use for local traffic as Macquarie Road. In 1968 a dual carriageway 3 km deviation was opened at Prospect. This replaced the only winding section of the Highway between Parramatta and Penrith. The bypassed section was heritage-listed in 2014 as the best-preserved section of the 1818 alignment.

From the late 1960s to the early 1970s the highway was almost entirely realigned and constructed to three lanes, being deviated as necessary, between Kirkconnell and Glanmire. Ironically this included reinstatement of most of the parts of Major Mitchell's 1830 alignment which had been deviated in 1929 to ease gradients.

This work was extended eastward to Mount Lambie in stages during the late 1980s and early 1990s. A second Cox's River deviation, to replace the 1929 deviation, was completed in 1993, between Marrangaroo and Mount Lambie.

At Katoomba the highway was deviated in 1985 to travel along the eastern side of the railway station, whereas the original alignment crossed the railway via a level crossing at the north end of Katoomba Street and ran along the western side of the railway. Immediately west of where the highway now crosses the railway due to this deviation, the highway was realigned over a distance of 1 km in 2004 to remove the sharp bend at 'Shell Corner'.

In Bathurst, the Denison Bridge (1870) was bypassed in 1991 by a realignment of the Highway where it crosses the Macquarie River into Bathurst city centre. Because of its heritage value it was retained for use by cyclists and pedestrians.

During 1991–1993 a massive cutting was made to improve and widen the alignment of the highway immediately east of Woodford. At the top of the southern side of this cutting can be seen the rudimentary excavation of the rock for Cox's 1815 road. This was severed in 1868 by the construction of the Springwood-Mount Victoria section of the Main Western Railway. The railway itself was deviated at this point in the 1920s when it was duplicated, and a cutting on the original alignment of the railway now forms the top section of the southern face of the highway cutting, the terrace in the face of the cutting being the bed of the original cutting.

In June 1993 the highway route was severed at Emu Plains with the closure to road traffic of the Knapsack Gully Viaduct. This occurred in conjunction with the westward extension of the M4 motorway from its terminus since 1971 at Russell Street, Emu Plains. This extension connects directly to the highway at Lapstone, bypassing the viaduct. The portion of the Great Western Highway west from Russell Street to Mitchells Pass Road is now only used by local traffic to access residential properties. Mitchells Pass, travelling is now one way eastbound between Lennox Bridge and the highway, due to its narrowness. Great Western Highway traffic therefore has to use the M4 between Russell St and Governors Drive.

A major realignment west from Mount Boyce (the highest point on the highway) to eliminate the Soldiers Pinch and other nearby sharp curves was completed in 2002.

Duplication and widening
From Railway Square to Woodville Road, the highway was widened to its present width when it was reconstructed in reinforced concrete in the 1930s. From Woodville Road west to The Northern Road the highway was widened, generally progressively westward, from the mid-1960s to the late 1970s. This section is a combination of six lanes with median strip, six lanes with wide landscaped median, and four lanes undivided. At The Northern Road in Kingswood the highway reverts to a four lane undivided configuration through Penrith shopping centre, widens to six lanes at the Castlereagh Road intersection, reverts to two lanes west from Castlereagh Road to Russell Street, and is then four lanes undivided with sealed shoulders from Russell Street to the base of Mitchells Pass, where it has been truncated.

Between 1981 and 2015 the NSW Government Roads & Maritime Services duplicated the highway between  and  west of Katoomba, generally working westward. This work incorporated the dual carriageway Springwood bypass, opened in 1967.

West of Katoomba, there is a further  of dual carriageway on the River Lett Hill, and  of dual carriageway from Magpie Hollow Road at Old Bowenfels to Lidsdale State Forest. This was completed as follows:
 road widening and realignment completed in 2006
River Lett Hill 2014/15
Old Bowenfels to Bowenfels completed in sections during the late 1990s
Bowenfels to Marrangaroo Creek mid-1970s
Marrangaroo interchange with the Castlereagh Highway 1970
Marrangaroo interchange to Lidsdale State Forest (second Cox's River deviation) 1993.

Four-lane undivided sections are the  of Victoria Pass (except for Mitchell's 1832 causeway, which is two lanes), and from Boyd Street in  to the terminus of the highway at its junction with the Mitchell and Mid Western Highways in West Bathurst (parts have a raised median strip).

From Lidsdale State Forest as far west as Glanmire most of the highway is three lanes, with almost continuous overtaking lanes alternating between eastbound and westbound.

Current projects
 Repairs and enhancements from Victoria Pass to Lithgow. The bridge at Victoria Pass is being refurbished and kept as two lane (one each direction.)
 Forty Bends upgrade (from top of River Lett Hill to Magpie Hollow Road) – consists of extension of the length of three-lane pavement and measures to reduce the incidence of black ice in winter
 Duplication from Ashworth Drive to Stockland Drive Kelso (in Bathurst).

Route numbers
When the national route numbering system was introduced in 1954, the full length of the Great Western Highway was designated as part of national route 32 (Sydney-Adelaide via Dubbo and Broken Hill), with the section from City Road to the Hume Highway (Liverpool Road) Summer Hill also being part of national route 31.

Current numbering is extremely confusing, as follows:
City Road to Hume Highway (Liverpool Road) Ashfield – A22, following the introduction of the 'Metroads' in the late 1990s. Before M5 East was opened in late 2001 it was Metroad 5. After 2001 it was State Route 31.
Liverpool Road, Ashfield to Wattle Street, Haberfield – no route number since the diversion via Stage 3, City-West Link on 2 June 2000.
Wattle Street, Haberfield to M4 Western Motorway intersection at Strathfield – A44, following the opening of M4 East in July 2019. Before this, it was part of the A4.
M4 Western Motorway intersection at Strathfield to Russell Street, Emu Plains – A44.
Russell Street-M4 at Lapstone (Knapsack Viaduct now closed) – no number.
M4 at Lapstone to intersection of Mitchell and Mid Western Highways in Bathurst (end of Great Western Highway) – A32.

The A32 continues along the Mitchell Highway as far as Nyngan, then follows the Barrier Highway to Gawler,  north of Adelaide, where it connects with the Sturt Highway (A20). The Mid Western Highway is A41 or B64 over its full length of Bathurst to , where it meets the Sturt Highway (A20) and Cobb Highway (B75).

Route number changes
Before the North Strathfield-Mays Hill and Huntingwood-Emu Plains sections of the then Western Freeway were joined by the construction of the missing link from Mays Hill to Huntingwood, the section of the highway between Reservoir Road, Huntingwood and Russell Street, Emu Plains was signposted as national route 32.  When Metroads were introduced, the highway east of North Strathfield and the full length of the Freeway were designated as Metroad 4.  The section of highway from Wattle St to the Liverpool Rd became unnumbered following the opening of the final stage of the City-West Link, so that Metroad 4 commenced under freeway conditions at Anzac Bridge, joining the Harbour Bridge and Cross-City Tunnel.

From the introduction of the Metroads until the opening of the M5 East (General Holmes Drive to King Georges Road) in 2001, the part of the highway between Railway Square and the Hume Highway was designated as part of Metroad 5.  When the M5 East was completed, the Metroad 5 designation was assigned to the freeway; those parts of the highways (both Great Western/Hume Highway) which had been part of Metroad 5 were then given over to a logical continuation of State Route 31 east beyond Metroad 3, which is now designated A22. From North Strathfield to Russell Street, Emu Plains the highway is now A44 (as is the section of Russell Street from the Highway to the M4).

When M4 East opened between Strathfield and Haberfield in July 2019, the M4 designation was rerouted onto the new motorway. As a result, the section of Great Western Highway/Parramatta Road between Strathfield and Haberfield was designated A44, replacing the previous A4 designation.

Transport in the Blue Mountains (New South Wales)"," Great Western Highway is a state highway in New South Wales, Australia. It is a major road through the Blue Mountains, and links the cities of Sydney and Bathurst. It has also been called the Coxs River Road, as it runs close to that river for most of its length. The highway is a component of the Great Western Highway Network, and is allocated State Route 32 for most of its length, except for the section west of Lithgow, which is allocated State Route 33. The Great Western Highway is a winding road, with many tight bends and steep grades. It generally follows the ridgeline between the Blue Mountains and the Central Tablelands, and consequently offers many scenic views. In many places the road is cut into the ridgeline, with very little shoulder, so it is very narrow. The Great Western Highway is a key highway for interstate and intrastate road transport, and is the main route from Sydney to Bathurst, Dubbo, and other parts of western New South Wales. In 2016, the road carried an average of 21,000 vehicles per day between Emu Plains and Blackheath, and 15,000 vehicles per day between Blackheath and Mount Victoria. The highway has been the site of many fatal traffic accidents. In 2016, four people died in a head-on collision near the Mount Victoria summit, after which the highway was closed for a week.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,613730,0.07778389286369475,0.08421052631578947,0.27217751992417877,0.11370716510903427,23,22,1,0,24,0,1,0,0,0,0.23067737463654794,0.024304521957408048,0.02568351284175642,0.020884520884520884,15,0,45,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,50,1,68,1,1,1

Career

Smederevo
Born in Smederevo, Ranković passed through the youth ranks of the club then called Sartid. He was later loaned to Železničar Smederevo in order to gain experience. Later on, Ranković also spent some time at Dubočica while serving his military duty in Leskovac.

In the summer of 2000, Ranković returned to Sartid and played three games in the 2000–01 season. He also sat on the bench in all four matches in the 2001 UEFA Intertoto Cup. However, with the arrival of Dragan Žilić and Nebojša Milekić, Ranković was sent out on loan to Bosnian side Slavija Sarajevo for the rest of the 2001–02 season.

In the summer of 2002, Ranković made another return to Sartid and became a member of the squad that won the Serbia and Montenegro Cup in the 2002–03 season. He began receiving more playing time after the departure of Žilić in the summer of 2004. Following the club's relegation from the top flight in 2008, Ranković established himself as the team's first-choice goalkeeper and helped them earn promotion back straight away. He continued playing regularly for the side over the next three seasons.

Later career
In July 2012, Ranković moved to fellow Serbian SuperLiga club Sloboda Užice on a free transfer. He missed just one league game in the 2012–13 season, as the team narrowly fell out of a UEFA Europa League spot. In the following campaign, Ranković again missed just one league match, but failed to help the side avoid relegation from the top flight.

During the 2014–15 and 2015–16 seasons, Ranković played regularly for Serbian First League club Sloga Petrovac.

Personal life
Nicknamed Šnicla (Serbian for ""schnitzel""), Ranković is a car mechanic, owning and maintaining an oldsmobile from 1968.

In the first phase of each tournament, the teams were divided into eight groups of four teams, in which all teams played each other once, and the first two teams in each group advanced to the next phase. The next phase of the tournament consisted of a quadrangular group for each tournament, in which the winners advanced to the final. The Apertura 2018 tournament began on 7 July 2018 and ended on 19 October 2018. The Clausura 2019 tournament will begin on 5 January 2019 and end on 2 April 2019. América was the defending champion, having defeated UNAM Pumas in the previous tournament's final. Guadalajara was the first team to qualify for the Apertura 2018 final, after winning its fourth game in a row to finish with 28 points. It was the first time a team had qualified for the final without losing a single game. The team ultimately won the tournament after defeating Toluca in the final.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Machrihanish"", the article should at least have 250 words","Machrihanish (, ) is a village in Argyll, on the west coast of Scotland. It is a short distance north of the tip of the Mull of Kintyre, which faces out towards Northern Ireland and the Atlantic.

Machrihanish bay
The main sandy beach of Machrihanish Bay runs  north to Westport, providing opportunities for surfing. Basic accommodation is available for surfing groups in the Machrihanish village hall. There are static caravans, wooden wigwams and camping spaces at the Machrihanish Holiday Park. The village is one of the start/finish points of the Kintyre Way, one of Scotland's Great Trails. The Scottish Wildlife Trust's Largiebaan nature reserve lies to the south, about  along the Kintyre Way.

Features
Campbeltown Airport, formerly RAF Machrihanish, is located near the village. Although still available to the Royal Air Force, the former airfield has been taken over by the specially-formed Machrihanish Airbase Community Company.

Coal was mined near the village; the Machrihanish Coalfield was one of Britain's smallest coalfields. A canal to Campbeltown was constructed between 1773 and 1794, later replaced by the narrow-gauge Campbeltown and Machrihanish Light Railway. Machrihanish railway station opened in 1906 and finally closed in 1932.

Machrihanish has a classic links golf course designed by Old Tom Morris, with views towards the islands of Gigha, Islay and Jura. A second, newer course has been built nearby called Machrihanish Dunes. This course is part of a multimillion-pound development by an American company, which has renovated the previously-dilapidated Ugadale Hotel in the village and owns the Royal Hotel on the sea front in nearby Campbeltown.

Weather data is collected from Machrihanish and broadcast in the Shipping Forecast.

Notable people
Reginald Aubrey Fessenden built a radio transmitting station with a  high mast there in 1905 to transmit Wireless Telegraphy to a similar station at Brant Rock in Massachusetts, United States. An exchange of messages took place on 1 January 1906 but the mast blew down in a gale on 5 December 1906 and was never rebuilt.

Cadets from the Air Training Corps recreated this historic trans-atlantic transmission in Easter of 2006. Edinburgh and South Scotland Wing, who were on camp at the nearby airfield, contacted the Civil Air Patrol cadets in Brant Rock on 14 April 2006.

The views and skies seen from the beach and Lossit Point to the west were a subject for the Scottish marine and landscape painter William McTaggart, who had a house in the village.

Surfing locations in Scotland"," Machrihanish is a village and a community council area in Argyll and Bute, Scotland. It is located on the Kintyre peninsula, on the western shore of the Firth of Clyde, looking out to the Isle of Arran. It is the site of the Machrihanish Airbase and the Machrihanish Golf Course, which is said to be the first course in Scotland to have been designed by a woman, Mary Queen of Scots. The village's main street is the A83, which connects Campbeltown to the south and Brodick, Arran to the north. The village is served by Machrihanish Airport. It is also the site of a large Army training base, home to the Scottish Ammunition Company, which was formerly an MOD facility responsible for the manufacture, storage, and distribution of a wide range of ammunition. The facility was sold by the MOD in 2001, and now functions as a commercial business. It is also the home of the first appointed Machrihanish Community Council, which was established in 1980. The village has a small primary school, and is in the catchment area of Tarbet Academy in North Kintyre. The Machrihanish area is also home to a number of pre-historic sites, including the standing stones at nearby Dunaverty, which is also the site of a ruined medieval castle. The village was formerly served by Machrihanish railway station, which was the terminus of the Campbeltown and Machrihanish Light Railway. The railway closed in 1932. The village was also the birthplace and home of the poet and songwriter Robert Tannahill.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,3854276,0.046738072054527756,0.10526315789473684,0.12832732530905686,0.14953271028037382,1,4,1,0,2,0,1,0,0,1,0.11884834671143359,0.029691464297297486,0.0013808340237503453,0.0343980343980344,3,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3,1,13,1,1,1

Postcode areas covering Yorkshire and the Humber
Wards and districts of Kingston upon Hull"," HU postcode area The HU postcode area, also known as the Hull postcode area, is a group of eleven postcode districts in the North East England region, within four post towns, which are; Hull, Hedon, Hessle and Cottingham. It is located in the north of the region, bordering the North Yorkshire and East Riding of Yorkshire areas. It covers an area of 1,929.4 square miles (5,000 km2) and in 2001 had a population of 300,000. It is a non-metropolitan area, with the exception of the main city of Hull, and includes the Humber Estuary, north of which are the towns of Hessle and Hedon. The area is also the location of the Humber Bridge, which connects the cities of Hull and Grimsby. The city of Hull has a unique telephone area code, 01482, which is not shared with any other area. The area code is 0845 for Hessle and 01430 for Hedon. In earlier times, the area was known as the North Riding of Yorkshire, and was covered by the Yorkshire and the Humber constituency. In the First World War, the Humber Estuary was the location of a large naval base, with two naval air stations, on the north and south banks. The base was the Royal Navy's main base in the North Sea, and was the home of the Grand Fleet. The southern boundary of the area is the Humber Estuary, and to the west is the North Sea. To the north the area includes the east of the North York Moors National Park. The area's highest point is in the national park, at 1110 feet (340 m), on the western edge, at Hawnby Hill. The landscape is very rural, with agricultural land making up most of the area. There are a number of nature reserves in the area, with the largest being at Hornsea. The area includes three Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, the first being the North York Moors, the second being the Yorkshire Wolds, and the third being the Humber Estuary. The area is the location of two civil parishes, which are; Hessle and Cottingham. The area is served by three main railway lines; the North Eastern Railway, which runs from Hull to Scarborough, the Hull and Barnsley Railway, which runs from Hull to Barnsley, and the East Coast Main Line, which runs from London to Edinburgh. The main stations are; Hull, Hessle, Cottingham and Hedon. The area is served by two main roads; the M62 motorway, which runs from west to east, and the A63 road, which runs from north to south. The A63 road runs parallel to the M62 motorway, and the two roads connect at a large interchange, at North Cave. The A164 road also runs through the area, from north to south-east. The area is served by two main airports; Humberside Airport, located in the east of the area, and Leeds Bradford International Airport, located in the west. The area is the location of a number of tourist attractions, with the main ones being; the Humber Bridge, the Humber Estuary, the North York Moors National Park, the Yorkshire Wolds, the East Riding of Yorkshire, and the city of Hull. The area is also the location of a number of notable landmarks, with the main ones being; the Humber Bridge, the Humber Estuary, the North York Moors National Park, the Yorkshire Wolds, the East Riding of Yorkshire, and the city of Hull.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Bifid cipher"", the article should at least have 250 words","In classical cryptography, the bifid cipher is a cipher which combines the Polybius square with transposition, and uses fractionation to achieve diffusion. It was invented around 1901 by Felix Delastelle.

Operation 
First, a mixed alphabet Polybius square is drawn up, where the I and the J share their position:
   1 2 3 4 5
 1 B G W K Z
 2 Q P N D S
 3 I O A X E
 4 F C L U M
 5 T H Y V R
The message is converted to its coordinates in the usual manner, but they are written vertically beneath:
 F L E E A T O N C E
 4 4 3 3 3 5 3 2 4 3
 1 3 5 5 3 1 2 3 2 5
They are then read out in rows:
 4 4 3 3 3 5 3 2 4 3 1 3 5 5 3 1 2 3 2 5
Then divided up into pairs again, and the pairs turned back into letters using the square:
 44 33 35 32 43 13 55 31 23 25
 U  A  E  O  L  W  R  I  N  S
In this way, each ciphertext character depends on two plaintext characters, so the bifid is a digraphic cipher, like the Playfair cipher. To decrypt, the procedure is simply reversed.

Longer messages are first broken up into blocks of fixed length, called the period, and the above
encryption procedure is applied to each block. One way to detect the period uses bigram statistics on ciphertext letters separated by half the period. For even periods, p, ciphertext letters
at a distance of p/2 are influenced by two plaintext letters, but for odd periods, p, ciphertext letters at distances of p/2 (rounded either up or down) are influenced by three plaintext letters. Thus, odd periods are more secure than even against this form of cryptanalysis, because it would require more text to find a statistical anomaly in trigram plaintext statistics than bigram plaintext statistics.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""International Knockout Mouse Consortium"", the article should at least have 250 words","The International Knockout Mouse Consortium (IKMC) is a scientific endeavour to produce a collection of mouse embryonic stem cell lines that together lack every gene in the genome, and then to distribute the cells to scientific researchers to create knockout mice to study. Many of the targeted alleles are designed so that they can generate both complete and conditional gene knockout mice.
The IKMC was initiated on March 15, 2007 at a meeting in Brussels. By 2011, Nature reported that approximately 17,000 different genes have already been disabled by the consortium, ""leaving only around 3,000 more to go"".

The consortium encompasses four major, high-throughput gene-targeted mutagenesis programs: the National Institutes of Health (NIH)-sponsored Knockout Mouse Program (KOMP) and state-funded Texas Institute for Genomic Medicine (TIGM) in the U.S., the North American Conditional Mouse Mutagenesis (NorCOMM) Program in Canada, and the European Conditional Mouse Mutagenesis (EUCOMM) Programme in Europe. The first of its annual meetings of members and funders, hosted by the country of its rotating chair, was held at the NIH in Bethesda, Maryland in the United States for 2007–2008, with Toronto, Canada hosting for 2008–2009.

Genetically modified organisms"," The International Knockout Mouse Consortium (IKMC) is an organization that aims to produce a comprehensive collection of mouse embryonic stem cell (ES cell) lines, in which every gene in the mouse genome has been rendered null by gene targeting, as well as a parallel collection of 'littermate' wild-type ES cell lines for use as controls. The IKMC has been awarded the status of International Science Council (ISC) Research Body, and is an initiative of the International Mouse Genome Conference (IMGC), which holds an annual meeting that serves as the IKMC's steering committee. The IKMC is an effort to create a comprehensive and systematic inactivation of every gene in the mouse genome, for use in studying gene function and interaction, as well as for use as a resource for novel gene discovery based on genetic and functional data. The IKMC uses a combination of traditional gene targeting and gene trapping to produce ES cell lines in which every gene is inactivated, as well as a parallel collection of 'littermate' wild-type ES cell lines for use as controls. As of June 2018, the IKMC has produced ES cell lines in which 4,908 genes have been inactivated, and 4,000 of these genes have been tested and found to be null. The genes are spread across 1,305 mouse strains, and the majority of the gene inactivations are on a C57BL/6J background. In addition to the gene inactivation strains, the IKMC also coordinates the production of ""littermate"" control ES cell lines, in which the same gene targeting or gene trapping does not take place, but in which the ES cells are otherwise identical to the gene-targeted ES cells of the same strain and litter. These littermate control ES cell lines are provided to researchers along with the gene-targeted ES cell lines, to act as a control for the experiment. The IKMC also coordinates with the International Mouse Mutagenesis Consortium (IMMC), which focuses on mutating genes in mice for the purpose of studying cancer, to avoid overlap in efforts.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,19983315,0.04050632911392405,0.06315789473684211,0.18072544347365635,0.27258566978193144,3,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0.204151574064711,0.03984943774770731,0.003452085059375863,0.038083538083538086,2,0,4,5,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,5,1,1,1

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Pawnee Chief"", the article should at least have 250 words","The Pawnee Chief is an American helicopter that was designed and produced by Pawnee Aviation of Longmont, Colorado and later McCook, Nebraska. It was first flown in December 2005. Now out of production, when it was available the aircraft was supplied as a kit for amateur construction.

Design and development
The Chief was designed to comply with the US Experimental - Amateur-built aircraft rules. It features a single main rotor, a two-bladed tail rotor, two or three-seats-in side-by-side configuration in an enclosed cockpit with a windshield and skid-type landing gear. The standard engine used is a V-8, liquid-cooled, four-stroke, Chevrolet automotive racing powerplant of  derated to . The aircraft fuselage is made from welded 4130 steel tubing with a composite cockpit fairing. Its  diameter two-bladed rotor is made from carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer. The aircraft has an empty weight of  and a gross weight of , giving a useful load of . With full fuel of  the aircraft has a payload for crew and baggage of . The cabin width is .

The Chief was the subject of a protracted development time line. The company explained the long development, ""we were determined not to put a product on the market before its time. We have seen other kits sold that did not complete their development and testing.  Their customers paid for completion of the development and in reality did much of their testing.. By delaying our availability project until it was truly completed, we will avoid placing unnecessary a lot of ""Airworthiness Directives"" and flight restrictions on our aircraft.""

In December 2005 first kit delivery was forecast for as early as January 2006, with a production rate of eight to ten per month and a first-year production of 50 to 60 kits expected for 2006. In 2005 when the aircraft first flew the company reported having ""700 interested customers"". The manufacturer estimated the construction time from the supplied kit as 150–200 hours.

The company seems to have gone out of business in late 2008.

Operational history
By April 2015 two examples were registered in the United States with the Federal Aviation Administration, although both registrations had expired. A total of three Chiefs had been registered at one time.

On 28 September 2006 a Chief crashed while hovering, with minor injuries to the pilot and passenger. The National Transportation Safety Board report stated, ""The amateur built helicopter impacted the ground during a test flight following the failure of a welded joint at a cyclic control cable bracket resulting in a loss of control authority. A post impact fire ensued, destroying the helicopter. The pilot reported he was in a low hover when the tail came up and the helicopter tilted. One of the skids subsequently caught the ground causing the helicopter to roll over. Examination of the helicopter revealed that a welded joint failed at a cyclic control cable bracket on the main rotor mast. Failure of the welded bracket caused the loss of input control authority from the cyclic control to the main rotor.""

Aircraft first flown in 2005"," Pawnee Chief The Pawnee Chief was a wooden steamboat that was built in 1873 by the D.A. Jones & Company shipyard in Cincinnati, Ohio, and was destroyed by fire on April 8, 1885, while on a journey from St. Louis, Missouri, to New Orleans, Louisiana. The ship was owned by the American Trading & Transportation Company of New York and was named for the Pawnee people. The Pawnee Chief was built to be a durable and economical steamboat. It was designed with a shallow draft so it could travel in relatively shallow water. The ship's hull was made of durable white oak that had been charred with a torch to protect it from wood-boring insects. The ship's superstructure was made of yellow pine that had been painted with oil. The Pawnee Chief was also equipped with a powerful fog whistle and a headlight. The Pawnee Chief was used to transport cargo and passengers on the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers. In 1885, the ship was traveling from St. Louis to New Orleans with a cargo of corn, wheat, and other goods. The ship was also carrying a large amount of black powder, which is used in the manufacture of dynamite. On the morning of April 8, 1885, the Pawnee Chief was near Caruthersville, Missouri, when it began to experience problems with its boiler. The ship's crew tried to repair the boiler, but were unable to do so. The ship's captain, John R. Kantola, decided to continue the journey to New Orleans, but at a slower speed. Sometime after midnight, the Pawnee Chief's boiler exploded, causing a fire that quickly spread through the ship. The ship's crew tried to fight the fire, but were unable to do so. The ship sank in the river, and the crew and passengers were forced to abandon ship. The Pawnee Chief was a total loss, and its cargo was lost as well. The ship's captain and crew were able to safely evacuate the ship, and there were no casualties. The cause of the boiler explosion was never determined.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,46297676,0.08860759493670886,0.17894736842105263,0.18136086841408525,0.2866043613707165,1,3,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0.19861199164956495,0.015850366478598523,0.0027616680475006906,0.01597051597051597,8,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,1,9,1,1,1

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Southampton Blitz"", the article should at least have 250 words","The Southampton Blitz was the heavy bombing of Southampton by the Nazi German Luftwaffe during World War II. Southampton was a strategic bombing target for the Luftwaffe as it contained both busy docks with associated business premises and factories and the Supermarine factory building Spitfires in Woolston. Being a large port city on the south coast it was within easy reach of German airfields in France.

During the war, 57 attacks on the city were made, but over 1,500 air raid warnings were issued. According to the Air Raid Precautions (ARP) Department approximately 2,300 bombs were dropped amounting to over 470 tonnes of high explosives. Over 30,000 incendiary devices were dropped on the city with nearly 45,000 buildings damaged or destroyed, with most of the city's High Street being hit.

Spitfire factory

The Supermarine factory building making Spitfires in Woolston was a key target in the city. On 24 and 26 September 1940 the Luftwaffe attacked the riverside factory during two day-time raids. Much of the factory was destroyed and 110 people were killed. Northam gasworks was also targeted on 26 September and 11 workers were killed in the raid.

Civic Centre

A daylight raid on 6 November 1940 targeted the city's Civic Centre. Hermann Goering, head of the Luftwaffe, had remarked that the Civic Centre appeared like a ""piece of cake"" from the air, and that he was going to ""cut himself a slice"". During the raid twelve bombs were dropped, including a direct hit on the Civic Centre with a 500lb high explosive. The bomb penetrated to the lower floors of the art gallery killing 35 people, including 15 children, who were having an art lesson in the basement.

Blitz

Of the 57 air raids, by far the worst were on 23 and 30 November and 1 December 1940 and these attacks are generally referred to as ""Southampton's Blitz"". Starting at 18:15, or 6:15 P.M, and running until midnight on the evening of 23 November, 77 people were killed and over 300 injured with the Civic Centre taking much of the brunt of the attack. The scale of the raid ruined the city's water supply and many of the fires had to be left to burn themselves out.

There were reports that the glow of the firestorm of Southampton burning could be seen from as far away as Cherbourg on the coast of France. Nazi publicity declared in propaganda that the city had been left a smoking ruin.

A week later, 120 German bombers returned for a further six-hour attack on the evening of 30 November. 800 bombs dropped on the city left 137 dead, 96 killed in their air raid shelters. Major buildings including Pirelli Cable Works, the Daily Echo newspaper building and the General Motors factory were severely damaged or destroyed. All Saints', Holyrood and St. Mary's churches, were destroyed, although St. Michael's escaped with only minor damage, allegedly because the spire was used by the German bombers as a landmark and their pilots were ordered not to hit it. Altogether, Southampton lost seven churches during the blitz, as well as the Audit House, the Ordnance Survey offices and many shops, factories and homes.

The last casualties of air raids in the city were in a small raid on the suburbs of the city in May 1941 and on 8 July 1941 in the area of Victory Crescent, Millbrook, killing three people. The last major raid of over 50 bombers was in June 1942. There were occasional tip and run raids and in 1944 two V1 flying bombs in mid-July were the last enemy ordnance to fall in the city.

Victims
Among the victims of the bombing was Edgar L. Perry, who had worked as a coal trimmer on board the RMS Titanic in 1912. Perry, who had survived the sinking, perished along with his wife on 23 November 1940 as they sought shelter from the bombing.

Southampton
The Blitz
20th century in Hampshire
20th century in Southampton"," Southampton Blitz During the Second World War, Southampton was the subject of two major bombing raids, the first of which took place on the nights of 30 and 31 May 1940. The city was targeted because it was the home of the ocean liner SS Rex, which was being used as a troopship, and the aircraft carrier HMS Argus, which was in dock for repairs. The German raiders were escorted by a force of about 20 Messerschmitt Bf 110s from Norway, which had been modified to carry a 50-mm anti-ship gun under their wings. The first attack on Southampton came on the evening of 30 May. Twenty-three Heinkel He 111s, supported by 25 Messerschmitts, dropped 40 high-explosive and 16 incendiary bombs on the city. The Messerschmitts also attacked the city's docks with their 50-mm guns, and a number of hits were scored on the SS Rex. The ship's commanding officer, Captain F. A. Lewey, ordered the ship to be moved to a position where the 50-mm guns could not bear. The Messerschmitts were able to score only four more hits on the ship before they were driven off by anti-aircraft fire from the ship and the surrounding area. The Heinkels were more successful, and by the morning of 31 May, the SS Rex was listing so badly that it had to be beached in the River Itchen. The Southampton Blitz After the attack on the SS Rex, the German aircraft turned their attention to other targets in the city. The Itchen Bridge was hit by two 50-mm shells, which caused it to collapse. This left the city's Floating Bridge as the only route across the river. The Germans also attacked the city's docks, and the oil tank at Woolston was set on fire. The German raid caused extensive damage to the city, with many buildings being destroyed or damaged. The Itchen Bridge was not the only bridge to be hit, as the Floating Bridge was also attacked. The bridge was hit by a number of bombs, which caused it to sink. The city's docks were also badly damaged, with many ships being sunk or damaged. The German aircraft returned to the city on the evening of 31 May for a second raid. This time they were more successful, as they were able to hit the SS Rex with a number of 50-mm shells. The ship was eventually beached in the River Itchen, and was later refloated and repaired. The Southampton Blitz was a major blow to the city, as it caused extensive damage and disruption. The city's docks were badly damaged, and many ships were sunk or damaged. The Itchen Bridge was also destroyed, which left the city's Floating Bridge as the only route across the river. The city was able to recover from the raid, but it was a major blow to the city's economy.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,7453117,0.06751054852320673,0.22105263157894736,0.19032742035124878,0.4953271028037383,1,4,1,0,5,0,1,0,0,1,0.15903973502176544,0.018703059243738995,0.002347417840375587,0.01597051597051597,4,0,5,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,9,1,15,1,1,1

In the Chesapeake Bay, the British Navy surprises the American Navy in a battle that ends in a U.S. victory. On August 24, in the Battle of Plattsburgh on Lake Champlain in New York, the British Navy suffers a defeat after being ambushed by the American Navy. On September 11, the British burn Washington, D.C. The British army, under the command of General Robert Ross, had intentions of capturing the capital. After an intense battle, the British overwhelmed the American forces and set fire to the Capitol building, the White House, the Library of Congress, and other government buildings. On September 13, at the Battle of Plattsburgh on Lake Champlain in New York, the British Navy is defeated again by the American Navy. The British are defeated at the Battle of Baltimore on September 13–14.

On October 5, the British are defeated at the Battle of New Orleans. The British, under the command of General Edward Pakenham, made a plan to capture the American city of New Orleans, which was a vital port for the American South. The British were delayed by the Americans for several days and were eventually defeated by a Louisiana Militia under the command of General Andrew Jackson. This battle is known as the Battle of New Orleans and is considered the greatest American victory of the War of 1812. On October 25, in the Gulf of Mexico, British forces destroy the USS Carolina, the USS Enterprise, and the USS Syren. On November 5, the British destroy the USS Wasp in the North Atlantic.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Bhanj dynasty"", the article should at least have 250 words","The Bhanja dynasty was an ancient dynasty that originated in the Utkala region of modern Odisha before the Gupta Empire arose as an imperial power. The dynasty, of ancient Kshatriya lineage, as documented by Indologist Hermann Kulke, succeeded the Vindhyatabi branch of the Nagas of Padmavati, who ruled from the Keonjhar district of Odisha and included  Satrubhanja, of the Asanpat inscription. The Bhanj later became feudatories of the Bhauma-Kara dynasty.

The successor branches of the Bhanja rulers became local feudatories to the united realms of the Eastern Ganga dynasty, the Gajapati Kingdom and eventually, with the advent of British rule became ruling dynasties of the princely states and zamindaries of the region. Prominent branches include the princely states of Mayurbhanj State and Keonjhar State.

History
The early Bhanjas emerged as leading chieftains succeeding the Nagas of the Vindhyatabi rulers in the Kendujhar and Western Odisha region, inheriting the region that consisted of the preceding Naga ruler Satrubhanja's domains and with the decline of the Gupta Empire who retreated from the Utkal (northern Odisha) region. With the supremacy of Bhauma-Kara dynasty rule in the Utkal region, they ruled as their feudatories which consisted of mandalas.

According to early mandala inscriptions, the Bhanjas describe their origins from the mythical peahen likely pointing out to the early peafowl-related traditions of the ancient Bhanja clans which is observed on their emblems which are also shared by the successive branches.

Khinjali and Khijjinga mandala were among the prominent mandalas under Bhauma-Kara rule.

Khinjali mandala
Khinjili mandala comprised areas of modern-day Boudh, Phulbani, Nayagarh, Ghumusar and Sonepur. Its capital was at Dhritipura (modern Boudh). Nettabhanja, who ruled over the Dhenkanal-Anugul region and made Nava-angulakapatana his capital, was regarded by R.D. Banerji and R.C. Majumdar as the earliest Bhanja king of the khinjali mandala line. The early Bhanjas were powerful feudatory rulers of independent sovereign principalities in early medieval Odisha. The territory passed into the hands of the Somavanshis after Ranabhanja, then his son Netribhanja established a new territory named after Khinjali. Copperplate inscriptions of Yasobhanja and his brother Jayabhanja at Antirigam and Kanakabhanja at Baudh show Bhanja rule continued in the Khijali region until the 12th century CE.

During the early 10th century CE, with political instabilities in the Bhauma-Kara kingdom, the neighboring Somavamshi and Bhanja dynasties attempted to conquer the region, leading to dissensions and political intrigues. The Bhanjas of Khinjali also married two of their princesses (Vakula Mahadevi and Dharma Mahadevi) to the Bhauma-Kara kings Shubhakaradeva V and his father Shantikaradeva III, and later controlled the Bhauma-Kara kingdom through them. The Bhauma-Kara territory eventually came under the control of the dominant Somavamshis.

Khijjinga mandala
Khijjinga, or Khijjinga-Kotta, comprised areas of modern-day Mayurbhanj and Kendujhar. Inscriptions refer to them as the founders of the Adi-Bhanja dynasty. The early history of Bhanja rule at Khijjinga is known from the copper plate inscriptions found at Bamanghaty near Rairangpur of Ranabhanja and Rajabhanja and the Khandadeuli inscription of Ranabhanja. The founder of the dynasty was Virabahdra Adi Bhanja with his capital located at Khijjinga Kota (now Khiching). The Kichakeshwari Temple was also built, by Khijjinga Bhanja ruler Rajabanja, according to inscriptions. The descendants of the Khijjinga mandala would later form the royal house of Mayurbhanj and its branches after the decline of the Somavamshis which occurred as a result of the advent of Eastern Ganga rule and subsequent unification of the Trikalinga (Utkala, Kalinga and Dakshin Koshala).

Mayurbhanj branch

The influence of the Khijjinga Bhanjas declined following the dominance of the Somavamshis in the Utkal region, but centuries later came back to prominence in the region with the rise of the Eastern Ganga dynasty after uniting the three realms of Trikalinga with the Bhanjas as their feudatories. Traditions point to numerous origins of the dynasty, but lack of records renders them unlikely although it is generally accepted that the founder, Adi Bhanja of the 8th century CE established the current dynasty of the Mayurbhanj state with his brother Jyoti Bhanja founding the Keonjhar State succeeding from the Khijjinga Adi Bhanja dynasty.

Keonjhar branch

According to traditions, Keonjhar State was founded sometime during the 12th century during the rule of the Eastern Ganga dynasty when the founder Jyoti Bhanj of the Bhanj dynasty, who was the brother of Adi Bhanj of Mayurbhanj, was enthroned as the Raja of Keonjhar with the help of dominant local Bhuyan clans. The influence of Bhuyans on the enthronement rituals and regnal traditions of Keonjhar suggests a long-standing relationship with the kingdom.

Baudh branch

With the advent of Eastern Ganga rules over the region post the defeat of the Somavamshis, there were local chieftains ruling over Baudh as Eastern Ganga feudatories. Upon a time the Brahmin chieftain was childless and hence adopted the nephew of the neighboring Raja of Keonjhar who belonged to the Bhanj dynasty. This prince named Ananga Bhanja named himself Ananga Deva and became the King of Baudh in the 14th century.

Daspalla branch

In the late 15th century around 1498 CE, Naren Bhanja, the brother of the Raja of Baudh was made chieftain of the Daspalla region, from which he later seceded and declared his independent kingdom leading to the creation of the Daspalla State.

Bastar branch

The Bastar state was long ruled by the descendants of the Kakatiya dynasty until the 1920s when King Rudra Pratap Deo's daughter and heir Rani Prafulla Kumari Devi married Prince Prafulla Chandra Bhanj Deo, who was the nephew of the King of Mayurbhanj Sriram Chandra Bhanj Deo. Their son Pravir Chandra Bhanj Deo became the first and only Bhanja ruler of Bastar from 1936 until 1948 when it acceded to India following Independence.

Kanika branch
The Kanika Bhanja branch was established by Bhujabal Bhanja, the brother of the Mayurbhanj state most likely around the 3rd century. It remained a prominent zamindari during the reigns of the Trikalingapati and Gajapati monarchs and also supported the Khurda rulers against the British after they took over Orissa from the Maratha Empire in 1803. After the Independence in the year 1947, it was certainly merged into the state of odisha following which the zamindari estates were abolished.

Garh Haladia branch
The Haladia estate was an ancient Vassal state of the Gajapati Empire which was ruled on their behalf by the Bhanj Monarchs. They are a branch of Mayurbhanj State but swore allegiance to the Gajapati Maharaja of Puri. It was founded by Anu Bhanj Deo, a scion of the Mayurbhanj Raj family who around the 11th century CE, came to Puri, married the daughter of the then Gajapati Maharaja of Puri, and obtained the estate as her dowry. Legend has it, that Anu Bhanj Deo along with his elder brother Chani Bhanj Deo came to Puri to attend the court of the Gajapati Maharaja at the behest of the then Maharaja of Mayurbhanj. It was during a Court proceeding that Chani Bhanj dossed off, this angered the Gajapati Maharaja who then threw a grape at him. Seeing this, Anu Bhanj, who was also present at the court threw his dagger at the grape and sliced it before it touched his elder brother. This Act of Loyalty towards his brother and the vigor with which he defended him impressed the Gajapati Maharaja. The Maharaja gave his daughter in marriage to Anu Bhanj Deo and made him the Raja of Haridra Estate, commonly known as Haldia Estate. Ramesh Chandra Bhanja prominent Linguist and Historian, belongs to this Branch.

Ghumusar branch
The rulers of Ghumusar zamindari were descendants of the Bhanja rulers of Khinjali mandala whose rule ended in the Boudh region as the Somavanshis conquered their territory during their conflicts with the Bhauma-Kara rulers during the 10th century CE and were eventually pushed into the Ghumusar region post 12th century where they set up their kingdom. They established their capital at a place called Kullad (A place near Bhanjanagar). Ghumusar Bhanja rulers contributed much to the development of Odia literature during the Riti Yuga/Bhanja Yuga phase like Balabhadra Bhanja, Tribikram Bhanja, Dhanajaya Bhanja,Ghana Bhanja and  Kabi Samrat Upendra Bhanja.

The Ghumusar branch came to an end during the rule of Dhananjaya Bhanja II in 1835 when the British annexed the Ghumusar region after suppressing the Ghumusar rebellion of 1835-36.

Hindu dynasties"," Bhanj dynasty The Bhanj dynasty, also known as the Bhanj er Bhanj or the Bhanjaka, was a ruling dynasty in the Indian subcontinent, who had their capital at the fort of Dohada in the present-day state of Jharkhand. The Bhanj dynasty emerged around the early 13th century and controlled the regions of Eastern Jharkhand, West Bengal, and Odisha for about four centuries. The origins of the Bhanj dynasty are unclear. According to tradition, the Bhanj dynasty was founded by a chief, Harinath, who had three sons, Bhimasen, Ranjit and Kashi. The eldest son, Bhimasen, was appointed as the first king of the dynasty. The dynasty later split into two branches, with the descendants of Bhimasen ruling over the eastern part of the kingdom and the descendants of Ranjit ruling over the western part. The Bhanj dynasty was a clan-based monarchy, with the king (or raja) exercising absolute power over his subjects. The king was typically elected from among the members of the ruling clan, and was often succeeded by his son. The dynasty also had a council of ministers (or durbar) who advised the king on matters of state. The Bhanj dynasty was known for its military power and its skill in battle. The dynasty also had a strong sense of family and tradition, and was known for its ability to maintain strong alliances with other ruling families in the region. The Bhanj dynasty ruled over a large area of land, and had a number of important cities and towns under its control. The dynasty also had a number of allies and tributaries, including the kingdoms of Orissa, Bihar, and Bengal. The Bhanj dynasty was eventually defeated by the British East India Company in the late 18th century, and the region came under British control. The last king of the Bhanj dynasty, Madan Manik, was killed in a battle with the British in 1791.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,43295175,0.04796802131912061,0.12631578947368421,0.16703593773950365,0.24299065420560748,9,12,0,0,3,1,1,0,0,0,0.17192557950181594,0.021866517494685492,0.008146920740127036,0.01597051597051597,16,1,18,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,16,1,38,1,1,0

Overview 
Muntakhab-ut-Tawarikh is a general history of the Muslims in India from Sabuktigin to 1595, commenced in 1590 followed by biographies of shaykhs, scholars, physicians and poets. `Abd al-Qadir Bada'uni began writing this history in the first half of 1590. The book was completed in October 1595. Its comprises on the 618 solar year's historic events. Muntakhab-ut-Tawarikh is based largely on Khawaja Nīzām-ud-Din Ahmad Sirhindi's Tabakāt-i-Akbar Shāhi (also known as Tabakāt-i-Akbari), with characteristic asides by `Abd al-Qadir Bada'uni.

This work in three volumes is a general History of the Muslims of India. The first volume contains historic accounts about the rulers and kings of Ghaznavids, Ghurid dynasty, Mamluk Dynasty (Delhi), Babur and Humayun.  It records the history of India from the coronation of Sabuktigin, founder of Ghaznavids Empire (A.D 977) down to the death of Mughal Emperor Humayun (24 January 1556). The second volume covers the first forty years of Mughal Emperor Akbar's reign from 14 February 1556 to October 1595. Abd al-Qadir Bada'uni was Eye-witness of Akbar's era.  This volume is an unusually frank and critical account of Akbar's administrative measures, particularly regarding religion and his conduct. This volume was kept concealed till Akbar's death and was published after Jahangir's accession (approximately in 1605). The third part contains the biographical accounts of the Saints, Poets and men of letters who were either known to him, or were attached to the court of Akbar.  The accounts relate to 38 Shaykhs (religious leaders), 69 scholars, 15 philosophers, physicians and 67 poets.

The work is noted for its hostile comments on Akbar's religious activities. Its existence was apparently kept secret until at least the tenth year of Jahangir's reign (1615). When Mullā 'Abd al-Bāķī Nahawandī, author of Ma'āthir-i- Rahimī, did not know of it when he completed his work in 1616. According to Shaykh Muhammad Baķā Sahāranpūrī, author of Mir'āt al-'Ālam, composed in 1667, said `Abd al-Qadir Bada'uni's children asserted to Jahangir that they did not know of the existence of the work.

In 1842 they travelled from Cork to the eastern frontier of the Cape and spent five years in the British colony there, at Fort Peddie and Grahamstown, in the so-called ""Ceded Territory"". Ward returned to Britain in 1848. This is when she started to publish full-length books, building on previous articles and short stories. The Wards may have lived in Dover before moving to Boulogne-sur-Mer in about 1851, but biographical details are scant. She died in 1873.

Writing

Her first published writing was in The United Service Journal and Naval and Military Magazine in the early 1840s. She began with articles about her father and later contributed reports about war and life in ""Kaffirland"", a British name for an area of the Cape Colony stretching from Kaffraria to Albany. (The name was based on the word Kaffir which the British used to describe the indigenous people of that region.) Ward developed an authoritative voice and was one of the first women whose work was treated as credible war reporting. Some of the writing she did in 1846 and 1847 formed the basis for the book which came out soon after her arrival in England in 1848: Five years in Kaffirland: with sketches of the late war in that country to the conclusion of peace: written on the spot.

This book was well-received in a period of public interest in the ""Kaffir War"" or War of the Axe. and ran to three editions. In the same year Ward's first novel, Helen Charteris, was also published but a reviewer complained that the main romance was ""encumbered"" by sub-plots.  Three years later her novel Jasper Lyle: a tale of Kafirland (sic) was more successful and was described in the Morning Post as ""truthful and popular"" with a ""fidelity and vivacity"" in its descriptions of ""Kaffir life and scenery"", ""giving it at the present moment an especial interest"". This too ran to three editions, plus two more in the 1870s after Ward's death and just before the Zulu War, when UK interest in South Africa was high.

Critics' interpretations of Ward's overall opinions vary. Some see her as ""stridently propagandist"" for British imperialism, particularly in her non-fiction writing about colonial South Africa, while others find more complex attitudes, for instance when the eponymous heroine of Helen Charteris is friendly with a Creole girl. Some believe Ward either felt unable to express unconventional views openly or held inconsistent attitudes without being particularly conscious of it. It has also been suggested she was offering a ""veiled critique"" or even deliberately expressing ""anti-colonial dissidence"". One critic thinks she wrote at first with ""full complicity in the prejudices of the frontier"" but later revealed a ""startling mismatch"" with this in her novels.

1873 deaths"," Harriet Ward (27 October 1901 – 10 June 1998) was an English artist, known for her paintings of horses and rural scenes. Ward was born in London, the daughter of a civil servant. She studied at the Slade School of Fine Art, where she won the Rome Scholarship in 1924, and spent two years in Italy, studying the works of the Old Masters. She lived in London for much of her life, and was a member of the London Group, but spent the last twenty years of her life in rural Kent. Ward was best known for her paintings of horses, which often featured as part of a rural scene, and for which she often used members of the Household Cavalry as models. Her works were exhibited at the Royal Academy, the New English Art Club, and the Senefelder Club, and were included in the British Council's exhibition of British art in South America in 1947, and in the exhibition 50 Years of British Art at the Royal Academy in 1953. She was also a member of the Society of Women Artists, and exhibited with them throughout the 1940s and 1950s.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Ludic interface"", the article should at least have 250 words","A ludic interface is a type of computer interface. In the field of human–computer interaction (HCI), the term ludic Interfaces describes a discipline that focuses on user interfaces that are inherently ""playful"". This field of interface research and design draws on concepts introduced by Dutch historian and cultural theorist Johan Huizinga in the book Homo Ludens (""Man the Player"" or ""Playing Man"").
Huizinga's work is considered an important contribution to the development of game studies.

The various tools and concepts associated with ludic interface development differ from mainstream technological systems that employ human computer interfacing and interaction. Ludic interfaces tend to be  more playful, are user-generated and user-driven, flexible, low-cost and cooperative. Such interfaces are often experimental and draw upon methods and knowledge from video game design,  interactive media, modding cultures, media conversion, and social networking. The goal of ludic interface design is to create interfacing technology that offers ease of use and is inherently playful.

Core concept
At its core, ""ludic interfaces"" is a subcategory of interfaces in general. The notion is not restricted to electronics or human–computer interaction, even if the terminology was developed in respect to digital technology. Various authors suggest to use the term ""ludic interfaces"" for non-digital phenomena, e.g. architectural facades, skins, wearable computers, media art. ""Ludic Interfaces"" is also a Masters programme development on a European level. It is the title of a European collaboration in creating a network of academic institutions and of world leading media centres to investigate, design and test publicly shared digital content. The programme development is a joint project by the University of Potsdam, Universidad Politécnica de Valencia, Universität für künstlerische und industrielle Gestaltung in Linz, and by the University of Salford in Greater Manchester.

History

Ludic interface design was first defined in 2002 by William Gaver, in ""Designing for Homo Ludens"", expanded in a later article in 2009.

The term was revisited in 2008 by International Symposium on Electronic Art) curators Gunalan Nadarajan and Vladimir Todorović to describe a panel section of ISEA2008 in Singapore. The term was introduced with the aim of counterbalancing the tendency of ""infantilization of play"" and stressing the ""complicities between technology and pleasure"".

In the same year a group of game artists and scholars at Leuphana University in Lueneburg started lecturing and writing about the theory of Ludic Interfaces and applied for a European grant to develop a Masters programme in Ludic Interfaces. The application was successful and the development has successfully been completed in 2013.

The notion of ""ludic interfaces"" has also historical roots in artistic practice and analysis of interfaces (cf. Christa Sommerer, Laurent Mignonneau), the notion of ""playfulness"" as a design and arts strategy, or the ""Ludic Society"" arts organisation.

Examples

Jess Kilby’s RFID Tarot table consists of a hand-painted black table with letters and signs drawn upon it, and a white set of cards containing radio-frequency tags. The installation is an example for a ludic set-up where the interface contributes significantly to the magic of the game. Hidden information within the blank cards allows the RFID reader, a digital tarot reader automaton, to interpret information hidden from the human eye. Kilby’s system interprets the information contained within the cards and displays videos of a frightening future. The game could certainly be implemented as a Flash simulation or be built for a 2D monitor display system, but without the materiality of the ludic interface, without the special lighting, and without the artist dressed in a fortune teller’s dress the game would not work at all. The same holds true for Mary Flanagan’s “Giant Joystick”. It is the interface with all its materiality, erotic connotations and haptic features which makes the ludic installation work so well. Ludic interfaces can also facilitate play in a musical sense. The ""postvinyl"" performance, originally commissioned by futuresonic festival Manchester in 2004 recontextualizes a computer game in a performance environment.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Boneland"", the article should at least have 250 words","Boneland is a 2012 novel by Alan Garner, a sequel to The Weirdstone of Brisingamen and The Moon of Gomrath. The boy Colin from the earlier novels is now an adult, still living near the top of Alderley Edge but now a professor working at the nearby Jodrell Bank Observatory. His solitary home is a kit-built hut (""A Bergli"") in a quarry. He has a form of amnesia which means he remembers nothing from before the age of 13, including his twin sister and his childhood adventures. He visits a psychotherapist and the gradual uncovering of his past forms the main story.

Interleaved with Colin's tale is another story set in the same part of England but at a distant time. A lone Stone-Age cave dweller leaves ""Ludcruck"" (the chasm of Ludchurch) in search of companionship.

Garner says that the focus of his research for the book was ""the universal myth of the sleeping hero"". He has written his own experience of psychotherapy into the novel. ""Go to the pain,"" he was told by his therapist, ""go to where it hurts the most, and say whatever it tells you"". An important item towards the end of the book is a Lower Palaeolithic hand axe. Garner keeps such an axe in his study, although his is from the Acheulean culture while the one in the book is from the even older Abbevillian culture.

British fantasy novels"," Boneland is the debut novel by Scottish writer Alexander J. M. Smith, first published in 2000 by Polygon Books. Boneland is a postmodern novel set in an indeterminate, undefined location, which is never named throughout the story. The novel is structured as a frame story, in which an old man, Mr. Bonelander, sits at his kitchen table and tells a story to a visitor, Mr. Smith, about his life, the life of his father, and the life of his grandfather. The story is periodically interrupted by Mr. Bonelander's interjections, in which he debates the veracity of his tale, and by Mr. Smith's interruptions, in which he asks questions about the story. The story proper is about the arrival of a man, known as The Stranger, in the rural community in which the Bonelander family lives. The Stranger builds a house for himself and his son, who is disabled and cannot walk. Over the years, the Stranger becomes a reclusive, mysterious figure, and the townspeople become suspicious of him. The Stranger dies, and his son disappears, but is later found dead in the forest. The townspeople blame the Bonelanders for the Stranger's death, and their persecution of the family leads to the death of Mr. Bonelander's father. The novel is told by Mr. Bonelander in the first person, but the identity of the ""Mr. Smith"" to whom he is telling the story is not known. Mr. Bonelander's tone is one of weariness and bitterness, and he frequently digresses from the story to comment on his own state and to question the purpose of storytelling.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,38657885,0.0911392405063291,0.08421052631578947,0.20868414085252848,0.16355140186915887,2,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0.1236801958406437,0.0283007359047087,0.0008285004142502071,0.030712530712530713,1,0,0,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,4,0,1,1

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Bathurst Motor Festival"", the article should at least have 250 words","The Bathurst Motor Festival is an annual motor racing event held at the Mount Panorama Circuit in Bathurst, New South Wales, Australia during the Easter long weekend. The event was first held in 2011 as a replacement for the Festival of Sporting Cars and as a way to give a higher number of drivers the opportunity to drive on the circuit. The event plays host to a variety of racing categories, including production cars, sports cars, open-wheel racing cars and historic cars, which take part in sprint races, endurance races and regularity sessions. Around 300 vehicles are entered for the event each year, with crowds of up to and over 10,000 people attending the event.  Car clubs also attend the event, displaying their cars within the confines of the circuit and performing parade laps. Since 2016, the Bathurst 6 Hour production car race has been the showpiece race of the event.

History
During the 2014 event, Formula 3 driver Simon Hodge set a new lap record for the circuit of 2:02.6701. Hodge's time remained as the lap record until the 2016 Liqui Moly Bathurst 12 Hour, where Shane van Gisbergen set a time of 2:01.567 in a McLaren 650S GT3.

During the 2016 event, Nathan Morcom and 2014 Bathurst 1000 winner Chaz Mostert won the inaugural Bathurst 6 Hour, which also saw the event's biggest weekend crowd to date. In winning the 2017 Bathurst 6 Hour, Paul Morris, driving with Luke Searle, became the first driver to win all of the three current major events at Mount Panorama; the 6 Hour, the Bathurst 1000, which he won in 2014 with Mostert, and the Bathurst 12 Hour, which he won in 2007 and 2010.

Racing categories
 

The following categories have raced at the Bathurst Motor Festival.

Bathurst 6 Hour

 

The Bathurst 6 Hour, currently known as the Hi-Tec Oils Bathurst 6 Hour for sponsorship reasons, is a race for Group 3E Series Production Cars and other invited cars that has been held as part of the Festival since 2016. The race is held on Easter Sunday, with practice and qualifying sessions taking place on the preceding two days.

History
The race is not to be confused with the 1962 Bathurst Six Hour Classic, a one-off event held for production touring and sports cars.

The Bathurst 12 Hour was an endurance race held for production cars from 1991 to 1995. It was revived in 2007 and continued as a production car-only race until 2010, before GT3 cars were made eligible for the race in 2011. Over the following years there was growing focus on the outright GT3 cars, while the number of production cars in the race declined. In April 2015, the former promoters of the 12 Hour, Yeehah Events, announced a six-hour race for Group 3E Series Production Cars, called the Bathurst 6 Hour, to be held at the Bathurst Motor Festival in 2016. Cars conforming to other regulations, such as V8 Utes and Saloon Cars, were also allowed to compete in the Invitational class.

The 2020 running of the race was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and was to be part of the inaugural Bathurst International event in November, however this event, along with the 6 Hour, was eventually cancelled due to border closures within Australia arising from the pandemic. The 6 Hour returned to its traditional Easter date in 2021.

Class structure
Entrants in the Bathurst 6 Hour are divided into six classes:
 Class X: Ultimate Performance
 Class A1: Extreme Performance (Forced Induction)
 Class A2: Extreme Performance (Naturally Aspirated)
 Class B1: High Performance (Forced Induction)
 Class B2: High Performance (Naturally Aspirated)
 Class C: Performance
 Class D: Production

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Samuel Rhoads Fisher"", the article should at least have 250 words","Samuel Rhoads Fisher was the secretary of the Navy of the Republic of Texas.

He was born in Pennsylvania on December 31, 1794 and settled in Texas in 1830 with his wife and four children in the Matagorda area. He represented Matagorda Municipality in the Convention of 1836 at Washington-on-the-Brazos where he signed the Texas Declaration of Independence.  President Sam Houston nominated Fisher as Secretary of the Texas Navy and the appointment was confirmed by the Senate on October 28, 1836.

A letter to presidential candidate Mirabeau B. Lamar in August 1838 from George Wheelwright urged reconsideration of Fisher for Secretary for the good of the navy and defense of the Republic and Houston suspended Fisher from office in October 1837, to secure ""harmony and efficiency"".  Many in the senate opposed the move and the Senate ordered Fisher's reinstatement on October 18, 1837. This event was a major incident in the early days of the Republic of Texas and added to the severe split between the various factions in the government.

Sam Houston Dixon in ""The Men Who Made Texas Free"" wrote that ""when Mr. Fisher died, Richard Ellis, who was president of the convention which declared Texas independent of Mexico, said from the floor of the Senate:  'In the death of Rhodes Fisher the Republic has lost one of its wisest defenders. He was a man of poise even midst times of stress and excitement. Well do some of us remember his cool and deliberate consideration of our acts at Old Washington, March, 1836; how his voice of caution rang out as men of zeal vied with one another in their precipitous rush to complete their labors of establishing a government and returning to their homes. So earnestly did he plead and so logical was his appeal that we were persuaded to follow his advice........There was nothing of the braggadocio about him and he did not lack courage to express his opinions.'""

Fisher died on March 14, 1839, and was buried at Matagorda. Fisher County, established in 1876, was named after him.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""New Church of the Theotokos"", the article should at least have 250 words","The New Church of the Theotokos () was a Byzantine church erected in Jerusalem by the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I (r. 527–565). 
Like the later Nea Ekklesia (Νέα Ἐκκλησία) in Constantinople, it is sometimes referred to in English as ""The Nea"".

The church was completed in 543 but was severely damaged or destroyed during the Persian conquest of the city in 614. It was further used as a source of building material by the Umayyads few decades later.

Primary sources

Two contemporary accounts survive that describe the building of the Nea, but neither author has much to say about the shape and organization of the church complex.  Cyril of Scythopolis, a Christian monk who lived in 525–558, records that the church was begun by the Patriarch Elias but left unfinished until Justinian allocated funds for its completion at the behest of St. Sabas in 531. A more detailed account of the church and its construction comes from Procopius, the principal historian of the sixth century and the primary source of information for the rule of the Emperor Justinian. In his De Aedificiis, he writes that “in Jerusalem he [Justinian] dedicated to the Mother of God a shrine with which no other can be compared.” The Nea was situated on Mount Zion, the highest hill in the city, near the Church of the Holy Apostles (built in 347) and the Basilica of Hagia Sion (built in 390). Due to the rugged topography, the architect Theodoros first had to extend the southeastern part of the hill and support the church with huge substructures. This account by Procopius corresponds with the excavations of Yoram Tsafrir, as well as a tablet uncovered on the vaulted subterranean cistern that securely dates the building to 543.

Location
Mount Zion was not a new site in Jerusalem for Christian patrons to erect their monuments, and as a result of past projects, monasteries, churches, and cult sites already existed there. Consequently, the highest available spot for the Nea to be constructed was on the southeastern slope of the hill, a far way down from the hegemonic vistas afforded to the Basilica of Hagia Sion that perched on the mount's peak. Yet by choosing this site, Justinian was attempting to position the Nea within the hierarchical power structure that was connected to the topographical highpoints of Jerusalem.  There are numerous motivations behind establishing a building such as the Nea on a height. The limited accessibility and semiotic significance of heights afford political and ideological control to its inhabitants, who maintain a panoptic view of control over those below. Heights traditionally held religious significance as well, as attested in the numerous theophanic accounts shared by Judaism, Christianity, and Islam (resources requested for this statement, particularly for Islam).  The decision to build on Mount Zion furthermore situated the Nea within the dialogue of the other two sacred religious buildings that occupied highpoints in the city, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Golgotha and the Basilica of Hagia Sion on Mount Zion.

Form and function of the Nea
The Nea was a building of great complexity. Although the longitudinal basilican structure was a relatively common typology for sixth-century churches in Palestine, the forecourt's arrangement, along with the placement of the adjoining hostel, hospital, and monastery remains problematic. According to Procopius, exterior porticoes on the south, west, and northern sides surrounded the structure.  Two huge columns stood in front of the western entrance, which was preceded by a colonnaded atrium. In front of the atrium was a round courtyard that opened onto the Cardo. Due to the sparse archaeological evidence and the obscurity of Procopius’ description, this plan is difficult to reconstruct.  Despite the obscurity of literary details, Tsafrir has proposed that west of the atrium, there were monumental gates that opened into an area that contained a gatehouse and an arch. Beyond this, Tsafrir has hypothesized two semicircles: one would have connected the church complex to the Cardo, while the other was located across the street and provided access to the hospital and hospice.

In the interior of the church, the nave terminated at a large apse that was flanked by two symmetrical smaller rooms with apses inscribed in their eastern walls. It is unclear whether the nave of the Nea had three or five aisles, but due to the unprecedentedly large dimensions of the church (approximately 100 m long by 52 m wide), archaeologists Yoram Tsafrir and Nahman Avigad both agree that while only two rows of interior columns have been uncovered, two additional rows would have likely been needed to adequately support the roofing structure.
In addition to being the largest known basilica in Palestine, the Nea also included a monastery, hostel, and hospital, as attested by Antoninus of Piacenza, who visited the basilica of St. Mary in 570, “with its great congregation of monks, and its guest houses for men and women. In catering for travelers they have a vast number of tables, and more than three thousand beds for the sick.” It is unclear where these other buildings were located. Based on archaeological finds of a southern revetment wall of the Nea church complex, and assuming that the complex was symmetrical, archaeologists estimate the overall width of the complex at 105 m.

According to  Graham (2008), ""The Nea gave architectural articulation to a theologoumenon [theological opinion] in Jerusalem, and conveyed, architecturally, a message regarding Justinian’s imperial policy, imperial presence in Palestine, and a self-conception as a Christian emperor.""

The Nea and the Madaba Map

In addition to the contemporary literary accounts and archaeological evidence, the Madaba Map preserves a sixth-century perception of the topography, cities, and monuments of the Mediterranean. The mosaic was discovered on the floor of the Church of St. George in Madaba, Jordan, and has been dated from 560–565, less than twenty years after the inauguration of the Nea in 543, and it is the oldest surviving cartographic representation of the Holy Land. The map depicts the Mediterranean world from Lebanon in the North to the Nile Delta in the South, and from the Mediterranean Sea in the west to the Eastern Desert. The city of Jerusalem is given prominence by its size and the mosaicists’ devotion to the detail of its monuments. No city represented in the map is larger. The central location of Jerusalem in the mosaic further supports Jerusalem's importance in the minds of the map's creators.

A closer look at Jerusalem reveals a pictorial representation of the city and its surrounding landscape.  It is depicted from a diagonal bird's eye perspective with no topographical impediments. The city's two cardos extend south from the Damascus Gate, with the main cardo horizontally bisecting the walled city. The street is opened up so that each of its colonnaded sides is equally visible. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre is the largest building in the map, suggesting its importance in the city's architectural hierarchy. It is situated perpendicular to the main cardo on its western side.  All components of the church – the rotunda, the basilica, the atrium, the eastern façade, and the exterior stairs – are visible.  Although the Holy Sepulchre is geographically located to the north of the Tetrapylon, the main road running perpendicular to the cardo from David's Gate, on the map it is situated where the decumanus should be.  Not only does its size emphasize the church's importance, its central location on the cardo furthers its reputation as the most sacred and popular pilgrimage site in the Holy City. The Nea is the third most prominent monument in the city after the Holy Sepulchre and Hagia Sion, even though in actuality it was the largest church in Jerusalem. The hieratic scale of monuments leads one to question how the Nea functioned in relation to the other monuments within the topography of the sixth century.

The selective details of Jerusalem's monuments reveal the Madaba Map to be concerned with providing the viewer with a topographical hierarchy of Old and New Testament places.  When viewed as a rendition of Jerusalem that is reflective of the sixth century habitus of Jerusalem, the map reveals a conception of the Christian sacred spaces and their interconnectedness.  The shift in Christian topography to the western part of the city is clearly visible. For example, the Temple Mount, the central religious monument to Jewish identity, is relegated to the eastern periphery of the city, eclipsed by the towering Christian monuments that occupy the center of the city.  Yoram Tsafrir has identified this area to be an open esplanade, marking the place of the Temple Mount.

The map provides a guide for pilgrims and viewers to the holy spaces, supporting Justinian's campaign to integrate the Nea as a sacred site that matched the holiness of the Holy Sepulchre and Hagia Sion. In order to provide access to the Nea, Justinian extended the cardo south to the Nea and the newly constructed Zion Gate.  This decision undoubtedly had political motivations, for it situated the Nea on the main route for pilgrims traveling between the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and the Church of the Holy Apostles.  Processions, stational liturgies, and individual worshipers passed between the Holy Sepulchre and Hagia Sion, thus including Justinian's church, but the Nea still failed to gain a place in the Christian collective memory as a site that was as holy as the other two main churches.  According to Antoninus of Piacenza, worshipers went straight from the Holy Sepulchre to Hagia Sion, only to double back to the Nea. Furthermore, by the 630s, Patriarch Sophronius does not even mention the Nea in his review of pilgrimage sites in Jerusalem.

The Nea and Solomon's Temple
Justinian attempted to leave his imperial mark on Jerusalem by situating a building of unprecedented size and splendor within the context of Jerusalem's oldest and most sacred monuments. Procopius's panegyric, the de Aedificiis (English: ""Buildings""), is perhaps the richest source that survives which offers possible motivations for Justinian's architectural restructuring of Jerusalem. A masterful work of propaganda, de Aedificiis was less concerned with extolling the greatness of the buildings that were constructed, and more so with celebrating the man who built them.  In order to situate Justinian within the tradition of grand builders in Jerusalem, Procopius most likely modeled his account after the biblical narrative of Solomon's Temple.  There are several literary parallels between the two accounts, the most foremost being that, according to Procopius, both of the building projects were blessed by God. Furthermore, it seems beyond coincidence that the measurements of the Nea are roughly twice the size of the Temple.

Like Herod’s engineers, who had to extend the southern end of the Temple platform, so too did Justinian’s architects; and just as Solomon imported cedars from Hiram of Tyre for the Temple’s roofing, Justinian had cedars brought in from Lebanon.  Procopius alludes to the monumental columns Jachim and Boaz that flanked the entrance into the Temple when describing those that decorated the entrance into the Nea.  Finally, there is an etymological link between the Nea and the Temple in Procopius’ work. The New Testament uses two different Greek words for ""Temple."" More frequently ""hieron"" refers to the general temple precincts (e.g., Matthew 21:14–15). To refer to the actual Temple, or the inner sanctum, the New Testament uses ""naos"" (e.g., Matthew 23:16–17). This latter term was appropriated and reinterpreted by Procopius, thus relocating the sacred term to apply to the newly built Nea.  The implications of creating a new sacred space dedicated to the Virgin that attempted to appropriate the sacred mythology of Solomon's Temple are quite profound.  Not only was Justinian's attempt at producing sacrality charged with political motivations, but for sixth-century Christians, the Nea undoubtedly symbolized the supremacy of Christianity and the Virgin over the abandoned Temple Mount that represented Judaism.

The demise of the Nea
The date of the destruction of the Nea Church is not known precisely. According to accounts preserved in The Capture of Jerusalem (Expugnationis Hierosolymae) the conquering Persians and their Jewish allies destroyed the church and killed the clergy in 614. The extent of the damage is unclear as Patriarch Sophronius delivered his Nativity sermon in the Nea Church in 634. Further damage to the church may have occurred from an earthquake in 746. In 808, a reference to the church appeared in the Commemoratorium de casis Dei and, in 870, it was mentioned by Bernard the Monk who stayed in a hospice next to the church. In the tenth century, Eutychius, the Melkite Patriarch of Alexandria, noted the Nea Church ruins. The damage by the Persians, in 614, may have been severe as the Persians may have searched for treasure believed stored within the church as speculated from Procopius' report of the Emperor Justinian sending sacred items to Jerusalem.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Hämeenlinna"", the article should at least have 250 words","Hämeenlinna (; ; ;  or Croneburgum) is a city and municipality of about  inhabitants in the heart of the historical province of Tavastia and the modern province of Kanta-Häme in the south of Finland. Hämeenlinna is the oldest inland city of Finland and was one of the most important Finnish cities until the 19th century. It still remains an important regional center. The medieval Häme Castle (also Tavastia Castle; ) is located in the city.

Hämeenlinna is known as the birthplace of Finnish national composer Jean Sibelius. Today, it belongs to the region of Tavastia Proper (Kanta-Häme), and before 2010 it was the residence city for the Governor of the province of Southern Finland. Nearby cities include the capital Helsinki (), Tampere () and Lahti (), the regional center of Päijänne Tavastia (Päijät-Häme).

The current neighboring municipalities of Hämeenlinna are Akaa, Asikkala, Hattula, Hausjärvi, Hollola, Janakkala, Loppi, Padasjoki, Pälkäne, Tammela, Urjala and Valkeakoski. The former municipalities, Hauho, Kalvola, Lammi, Renko and Tuulos, were consolidated with Hämeenlinna on 1 January 2009; with these municipal associations, the Hattula municipality is almost completely surrounded by Hämeenlinna.

The coat of arms of Hämeenlinna is based on the 17th century town seal, which in turn refers to the Häme Castle built by the Lake Vanajavesi in the Middle Ages, near which the city was founded. The current coat of arms was designed by Gustaf von Numers on the basis of the old coat of arms, and was confirmed on September 21, 1956.

Geography

There are a total of 339 lakes in whole or in part in the area of the city of Hämeenlinna. The largest of them are Lake Vanajavesi, Lake Kukkia and Lake Kuohijärvi. The main features of the Hämeenlinna landscape are the Häme Lake Plateau, the Vanajavesi Valley and the Kanta-Häme Grove Center. In many places, the landscapes are marked by the prosperous Tavastian agricultural culture.

Cityscape
The center of Hämeenlinna is located on the Saarinen Hill on the shores of Lake Vanajavesi, and is bordered on the west by Highway 3 (E12), while Highway 10 bypasses the city to the south and east. The street network in the center is based on a grid pattern drawn up by C. L. Engel in 1832 with the Market Square as its center. On the edge of the market square are the town hall, Hämeenlinna Church and the Häme County Government House. The city center is divided into four districts, which are Linnanniemi, Koilliskulma, Hämeensaari and Saaristenmäki. Raatihuoneenkatu, which has been partially transformed into a pedestrian street, is the most significant shopping street in the city center; for example, at the western end of the street, the Goodman Shopping Center was completed in October 2014.

There are plenty of buildings of different styles in the city center, and in proportion to the city’s population, it is quite large and densely built. The most significant expansion direction in the city center in the 2010s has been the Keinusaari district on the other side of Lake Vanajavesi, where, for example, the city's railway station is located. New supplementary construction has also been carried out in the city center on an ongoing basis. The center of Hämeenlinna has been ridiculed as the ""Finland's largest lighted cemetery"".

History
There was a settlement called Vanaja by the Lake Vanajavesi where the city now stands since the Viking Age. The castle was built in the late 13th century to secure Swedish power in central Finland. A village was established near Häme Castle to provide services and goods to its inhabitants.

The village was granted city rights on January 19, 1639 and soon after that the King of Sweden moved it one kilometre () south to the hill on which it still stands. The city is known for its schools and academies where many famous Finns have studied. Schools, government and the military have characterised the life of Hämeenlinna throughout history. Finland's first railway line, the  (, ), opened between Hämeenlinna and Helsinki on March 17, 1862. The current Hämeenlinna railway station ( in Finnish) was built in 1921.

The population of Hämeenlinna was 49,451 in 2021, making it the 7th largest city in Finland. Hämeenlinna has a long history. It was first mentioned in 1546 as a resting place for the army of King Gustav Vasa on his way to the Battle of Aland. The city was originally named after the Häme Castle, the center of the medieval province of Häme. The castle is located in the very centre of the city. Hämeenlinna has always been an important location for the Finnish economy. In the 19th century, the city had Finland's largest agricultural machine factory, and in the 20th century, it became the home for the KONE corporation, the world's second largest elevator manufacturer. The city is home to two universities, the University of Häme and the Häme University of Applied Sciences (HAMK). The city has a population of about 20,000 students, which gives the city a youthful character. Hämeenlinna is also well-known for its historic buildings, such as the Vanamo House, which is the oldest surviving wooden house in Finland, and the Riihivaara House, which was designed by Carl Ludvig Engel and built in the neoclassical style. Hämeenlinna is also known for the Hämeenlinna block, a prison facility located in the city. The prison was originally built for the Russian army in the 19th century, and in the 20th century it was used as a prison for Finnish criminals.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Pokémon the Movie: Secrets of the Jungle"", the article should at least have 250 words","Pokémon the Movie: Secrets of the Jungle is a 2020 Japanese anime film based on Satoshi Tajiri's Pokémon media franchise and produced by OLM. It is the twenty-third film in the Pokémon universe, covering Generation VIII. The film returns to the series’ traditional 2D art style rather than using the CGI animation used in Mewtwo Strikes Back: Evolution. It features the new Generation VIII Mythical Pokémon Zarude and a shiny Celebi.

In Japan, the film was released on December 25, 2020, by Toho. The original release date of July 10, 2020, was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. The film released worldwide (excluding Japan, Korea, and China) on Netflix on October 8, 2021.

For a limited time, if players of Pokémon Sword and Shield preordered tickets for this film's premiere, they would get the Mythical Pokémon Zarude in its ""Dada"" form and a Shiny Celebi.

Plot
In the Forest of Okoya, the Mythical Pokémon Zarude finds an infant boy in a cradle washed up on a riverbank. Unable to leave the child on his own, Zarude adopts him as a son, giving him the name ""Koko"". Zarude leaves his tribe, which inhabits a Great Tree deep in the jungle where humans are forbidden to venture, to raise Koko who grows up as a feral child.

Ten years later, Ash Ketchum and Pikachu visit the Forest of Okoya from nearby Milyfa Town. While attempting to capture a wild Cramorant, Ash and Pikachu encounter a research team from the Biotope Company, a scientific organization studying the jungle. Team Rocket, covertly following them, look up information on the Biotope Company and its leader Dr. Zed, and decide to infiltrate the group.

Later, Ash sees Koko go over a waterfall, after he got knocked out from a pipe while swinging on a vine with a wild Skwovet, and retrieves him from the water, bringing him to Milyfa Town's Pokémon Center for treatment. When Koko awakens, he becomes alarmed and escapes the building, having never seen other humans before. Discovering that Koko believes himself to be a Pokémon, Ash and Pikachu spend time with him in the town, helping him to learn about humans for the first time.

Ash, Pikachu and Koko later encounter Zarude, who is forced to admit the truth about Koko's heritage. Zarude brings them to an abandoned laboratory he found shortly after adopting Koko, where he shows them a photograph he found of an infant Koko with his human parents. Zarude then leaves, returning to the Great Tree alone.

Discovering a wallet from Biotope Company, Ash brings Koko to their headquarters, where they meet with Dr. Zed. He reveals that Koko's parents are Chrom and Phossa Molybden, a pair of scientists who led the organization in researching the healing springs, and that Koko's real name is Al Molybden. However, Chrom and Phossa were killed in a car accident ten years ago, which was presumed to have killed Al as well. Dr. Zed scans Koko's pendant and discovers partially corrupted data on it that reveals an image of the Great Tree. Distraught over the news of his parents' fate, Koko flees to the Great Tree as well.

As soon as he reaches the Great Tree, Koko discovers a tracking chip planted on him by Dr. Zed. Zed arrives with his research team, which Team Rocket have infiltrated, along with a giant, spider-like tank. Koko and Ash try to stop Zed's actions, but he restrains them using his Ariados and throws them into the back of one of his trucks. He then fires missiles at the Great Tree, blasting open holes from which the spring water gushes forth. Ash, Pikachu and Koko escape with unwitting help from Team Rocket as they wrestle with the Cramorant from earlier and confront Dr. Zed, who suffers a psychotic breakdown and admits that, when Chrom and Phossa Molybden discovered the Great Tree's location but refused to continue researching it out of respect for the Zarude tribe, he killed the couple by running them off a road and stealing their supply of the spring water before leaving them to die in the explosion of their wrecked car. Before they perished, Chrom and Phossa sent the infant Al down the river with a drive containing the rest of their research, leading to Zarude finding him.

Dr. Zed seizes control of the tank from his henchmen, and Ash, Pikachu and Koko try to fight him to no avail. Zarude's tribe arrives, having been convinced to help save the jungle by Zarude who raised Koko. Koko's father figure also brings a group of wild Pokémon, who previously disliked his tribe due to their selfish behavior, to assist. Zarude is injured in the battle and nearly succumbs, but Koko manages to harness the power of the jungle as if he were indeed a Pokémon, healing him. With all their combined forces, they manage to break the tank's power source, disabling it. Zed attempts to escape, but is captured by Koko.

In the aftermath, the humans and Pokémon work together to restore the damage done to the jungle. Dr. Zed is arrested for his crimes and is loaded into a police van by Officer Jenny, based on evidence leaked by Team Rocket. Koko decides to leave to explore the human world and become the bridge between humans and Pokémon, taking the photograph of his parents along with him. As he and Ash leave the Forest of Okoya, they see Zarude turn the healing springs into a geyser to send Koko off. Cheered up by this, Koko goes forth into his future, embracing his dual identity as a Zarude and a human. At the Great Tree, Zarude who raised Koko sees a Shiny Celebi, which observes Zarude now living in harmony with the other Pokémon.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""New London Harbor Light"", the article should at least have 250 words","New London Harbor Light is a lighthouse in Connecticut on the west side of the New London harbor entrance. It is the nation's fifth oldest light station and the seventh oldest U.S. lighthouse. It is both the oldest and the tallest lighthouse in Connecticut and on Long Island Sound, with its tower reaching 90 feet.

The light is visible for 15 miles and consists of three seconds of white light every six seconds. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. It is currently owned and maintained by the New London Maritime Society as part of the National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act program.

Location
New London Harbor Light is located at Lighthouse Point in southern New London, just east of Guthrie Beach off Pequot Avenue.  In addition to the lighthouse, the station includes the keeper's house, a two-and-a-half-story brick residence.  The property once also included a barn, an oil house, and an engine room; all of these structures have been removed.

History

The original New London Harbor Lighthouse was built on the west side of the entrance to New London Harbor in 1760. Connecticut ceded the lighthouse to the United States according to the ""Memoranda of Cessions"" of 7 August 1789.

On May 7, 1800, Congress appropriated funds to rebuild the lighthouse, and it was removed in 1801 when the current stone tower was built. In 1855, a fourth-order Fresnel lens replaced the original 11 lamps with  reflectors.  Illumination was converted to oil-vapor lamp in 1909 and to acetylene in 1912.  The light was electrified in 1930.  The present keeper's house was built in 1863, and was enlarged in 1900 to accommodate the families of married keepers.  The light was acquired by the New London Maritime Society in 2010.

It is located on the former site of Fort Trumbull, which was an integral part of the harbor's defenses during the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812. In Nigerians, Fort Trumbull was the site of a battle in which the British captured the fort from the French in 1781 during the American Revolutionary War. The British remained in control of the fort until the end of the war in 1783, when they evacuated and destroyed much of the fort's infrastructure. The United States government reconstructed Fort Trumbull in the early 1800s, and it was equipped with twenty-six 24-pounders and two 13-inch mortars. During the War of 1812, the fort was the site of a battle between British forces, assisted by a contingent of loyalists, and American militia led by Connecticut Governor Roger Griswold. On September 6, 1814, the British attacked the fort and burned the surrounding village of Groton. They were repulsed with significant losses by the fort's garrison, which was assisted by the crew of the USS Flicker. The British retreated to their ships and shelled the fort for the next three days. The fort's 150-man garrison held out, despite suffering twenty-one casualties, until the British abandoned the field on September 9. The New London Harbor Light was one of the earliest lighthouses in the United States. It was lit in 1760, and is therefore known as the third oldest lighthouse in the country. The New London Harbor Light was also the first lighthouse in the country to be built on a fort. The New London Harbor Light is a Visitors' Center for the New London Maritime Museum. The Museum offers tours of the Light and Fort Trumbull. Connecticut's state seal features a shield with a blue background, on which a tall ship, a symbol of the state's maritime history, is depicted. The state motto, ""Qui Transtulit Sustinet,"" is displayed on a ribbon surrounding the shield, and translates to ""He Who Transplanted Still Sustains."" The seal was adopted in 1775, shortly after the colony's inception.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,7123996,0.0590717299578059,0.15789473684210525,0.16159209248963022,0.3161993769470405,1,2,1,0,3,0,1,0,0,1,0.163619664206345,0.019159829802222892,0.004418668876001105,0.0171990171990172,5,0,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,6,1,12,1,1,1
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Phyllachora maydis"", the article should at least have 250 words","Phyllachora maydis is a plant pathogen causing ascomycete diseases in maize/corn, and is more commonly referred to as tar spot. Identified by the distinctive development of stroma, this pathogen in itself is of little economic importance in the production of corn. However, the accompanying fungal infection of Monographella maydis, identified by “fish-eye” lesions, was claimed to cause significant foliar damage and subsequently yield reduction.  there is insufficient information about this pathogen and its management.

Symptoms and signs
This pathogen is an obligate parasite solely of the species Zea mays. The first symptoms are yellowing spots on both upper and lower leaf surfaces. Within the spot develops the characteristic black stromata over the ascomata, along with chlorosis of surrounding tissue. The chlorotic rings may be elliptical, circular, or may conjoin to form striping up to  long. Some of the chlorotic tissue around the ascomata may become necrotic with darker edges, forming the indicative  “fish-eye”. The presence of these lesions is not universal, nor is the association of these lesions with M. maydis. Research is ongoing to determine the exact cause of these lesions. Symptoms have been recorded as early as V3, but are most commonly observed during R3-R6 on or below the ear leaves.

Disease cycle
Little is known about the progression of Phyllachora maydis. Presently, it is believed that the stromata overwinter on corn and soil residue. This is the primary inoculum that must be destroyed if the cycle is to be interrupted. Providing optimal temperatures, humidity and rainfall however, ascospores and conidia will be released in a gelatinous mass on the stromata. Both wind and precipitation are used to disperse the spores; however it is solely the ascospores that infect other plants. The role of conidia in the reproductive cycle is still unknown. The ascospores are released in bunches, and can travel as much as  with wind dispersion. Following infection, new stromata can form within 12–15 days in infected tissue, producing additional ascospores and conidia. Given the polycyclic nature of this pathogen, as well as the ability to infect corn at any developmental stage, it is extremely hard to manage.

The pathogen progresses from the lower leaves to the upper leaves and husks. As many as 4000 clypeus may form on a leaf, resulting in 80% of affected leaf area. Given optimal conditions, total leaf death can occur in as little as twenty one days.

Distribution
Native to the Americas, from Mexico south, P. maydis appeared in the US for the first time in 2015 in Illinois and Indiana, then Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, Minnesota, Missouri, and Wisconsin in 2019. Tar spot appeared in Wisconsin in Green and Iowa counties in 2016, and had become a serious problem by 2018. When surveyed by the university and DATCP, it was found that 33 counties had recorded cases, and 77 of 79 fields surveyed, or 97 percent, showed signs.

Environment
In Latin America, the disease propagated quickly in temperatures ranging from  with high humidity. Long periods of moisture on the leaf surface also increased the disease incidence. However, in the Midwest, it is still unknown as to the conditions that are preferred by the pathogen. During 2015 and 2018 when there was a high incidence of tar spot, the weather was warmer with high humidity and precipitation frequency, possibly attributing to the increased number of cases reported. Additional research is needed to understand the optimal conditions for propagation of this disease in the Midwest.

Management
A basic control measure that could be implemented is residue management. By tilling the field and rotating crops, this helps reduce the primary inoculum that overwinters on stalks and other residue. A biological control method that has shown potential is the infection with Coniothyrium phyllochorae by reducing lesion size due to hyperparasitism. Chemical control with one or two treatments of Fenpropimorph or Mancozeb applied every ten days were the most effective fungicides used in field trials. Although no cultivars currently exist that are immune to this pathogen, CIMMYT has developed 14 inbred lines in Latin America that are highly resistant. However, most hybrids used in the Midwest have proven susceptible.

Economic importance
Tar spot causes low ear weight, vivipary, and poor kernel fill resulting in up to a 30 bushel loss per acre. Increased lodging and stalk rot have also been associated with intense cases. Losses have become severe in some areas of the USA since 2018.

Phyllachorales
Fungal plant pathogens and diseases
Maize diseases"," Phyllachora maydis, the maydis leaf spot fungus, is a widespread and serious fungal disease of sorghum and is occasionally found on corn. It is a member of the order Chaetothyriales, family Phyllachoraceae. Sporulation occurs on the upper surface of the leaves. The fruiting bodies are pale-brown to dark-brown, and measure 3–6 mm (0.12–0.24 in) in diameter. The conidia are single-celled, hyaline, and measure 3–5 µm in length. The disease is found in most sorghum-growing regions of the world, but is most prevalent in areas with long, hot, and humid growing seasons. It is also occasionally found in parts of Mexico and the United States. The disease is most serious when it occurs early in the growing season. It causes the leaves to turn brown and die, which can lead to the death of the entire plant. In less severe cases, it causes the leaves to turn yellow and drop, which can reduce the plant's ability to produce grain. There are currently no chemical treatments available for maydis leaf spot, so cultural control is the only method of managing the disease. Cultural control includes planting resistant varieties, using crop rotation, and avoiding the use of infected seed.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,62563135,0.13924050632911392,0.09473684210526316,0.2565528196981732,0.059190031152647975,0,2,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0.16863337831902594,0.016256141682242944,0.002071251035625518,0.011056511056511056,4,1,2,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,1,8,0,1,1
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Roscrea Brooch"", the article should at least have 250 words","The Roscrea brooch (catalogue number NMI P.737) is a 9th-century Celtic brooch of the pseudo-penannular type, found at or near Roscrea, County Tipperary, Ireland, before 1829. It is made from cast silver, and decorated with zoomorphic patterns of open-jawed animals and gilded gold filigree, and is 9.5 cm in height and 8.3 cm wide. The silver is of an unusually high quality for Irish metalwork of the period, indicating that its craftsmen were both trading materials with settled Vikings, who had first, traumatically, invaded the island in the preceding century, and had absorbed elements of the Scandinavian's imagery and metalwork techniques.

It was rediscovered in the 1820s and was in the possession of the artist and antiquarian George Petrie in 1850, until acquired in 1867 by the Royal Irish Academy, Dublin, following his death the previous year. Although not considered as innovative and significant as near contemporary examples, such as the Tara Brooch, it is formed from unusually high quality material, including first grade silver and its linings of amber, which was very difficult to source in Ireland at the time.

Replicas of the brooch became popular from the mid-19th century Celtic Revival, some of which are of a high quality. Despite the loss of some of its bosses, is in overall good condition, and is today in the collection of the National Museum of Ireland, Dublin.

Dating
The brooch is variously dated as from the early (Mitchell) to late (O'Toole/NMI) 9th century. Writing in 1983, historian Micheal Ryan gave a probable dating of the mid to late-9th century, and Henderson notes that its zoomorphic iconography has parallels with Scottish designs of that period.

The brooch, and the 8th century Book of Dimma found at Roscrea Abbey, and Stowe Missal from the nearby village of Lorrha, indicate the relative prosperity of the town during the period. In 1993, the historian Orna Somerville noted how, by the 8th century, brooch rings such as the current example and those found in the Hill of Tara and at Killamery, ""had ceased to be functional and was primarily a vehicle for elaborate decoration"".

Description

The brooch is of the pseudo-penannular type (i.e. the ring is fully closed, but has two separately defined terminals). It weighs  122.85 grams, and is 9.5 cm high and 8.3 cm wide, and is made from cast silver, amber and gold. The brooch has an overall lozenge shape, with a large flat triangular head and crest of rounded compartments decorated with gold filigree. The 8 cm long pin emerges through the mouth of a basal animal, and is attached to both the front and back sides of the plate. The pinhead contains pairs of concentric relief rings decorated with filigree. Both the pinhead and plate are decorated with rows of dots. The three main panels are also decorated with filigree, The outer edges of the terminals contain a pair of animals separated by an amber stud on the terminal's outer edges. Their bodies are co-joined from the area around their tails, a motif also found in a brooch found in Derryloughan, County Tyrone and in the 8th- or 9th-century  Derrynaflan Chalice.

Its depictions of animals are of both the Tara (c. 710–750 AD) type strap-like (flat) and Killamery Brooch (9th century) tube-like body (rounded) forms, and is thus considered to be a transitional work between these two periods. The animals are in places open-jawed, and generally are positioned in rectangular panels and given rounded, ribbon-like bodies.

Only three of the seven large hemispherical amber bosses (raised circular ornamental studs) are intact; one been lost and three are badly damaged. It originally had twenty-four in-filled D-shaped panels, of which, according to historian Niamh Whitfield: ""eleven were D-shaped amber studs alternating with filigree, except at the top of the pinhead, where all four D-shaped panels contained filigree. Of these D-shaped amber studs, however, a fragment of just one survives at the edge of the right terminal.""

Although its design is not as refined or sophisticated as other contemporary Irish brooches, and has been described ""crude"" compared to the similar Tara Brooch, the Roscrea Brooch is highly ornate and its material is of a very high quality. In 2013 it was described by  writer Fintan O'Toole as ""distinctively Irish"" when he selected it for his book A History of Ireland in 100 Objects, co-published by the Irish Times and Royal Irish Academy. O'Toole wrote that the object's ""abstract patterns and elongated animals are typical of basic forms of Irish visual art"" and that ""there is as much continuity here as there is innovation.""

The influence of contact with recent Viking invaders is evident in two ways, most notably from its composition from high quality silver, which would have been near impossible to source locally. In addition, amber could only be sourced from Scandinavia or the Baltic region, and is rarely found in Irish metalwork before the 9th century. Both these facts indicate that its workmen were able to trade with the invading Norsemen. In addition, a number of large bosses contain Viking-influenced designs, including of kite shaped brooches and depictions of thistles.

Find-spot and provenance

It was in the possession of the artist, antiquarian and artifact dealer George Petrie by 1850. A number of recent historians, including Stephen Briggs, doubt Petrie's claim that the find-spot was in Roscrea town, and view Petrie's claim as motivated towards increasing the objects market value. According to Briggs, Petrie had profited from selling copies of the brooch during the 1850s Celtic Revival boom that saw  high demand for Irish ornaments. Briggs claimed that Petrie was ""unfussy about his acquisitions’ provenances and that during the 1850s he appeared willing to invent an appropriate find-spot for his brooch, probably to help market its replicas"", although he clarifies that Petrie was a ""meticulous scholar whose abilities and research practices are not here in question"". Most historians do however believe it was at least found in a location not far outside Roscrea, although Briggs speculates that it is the same brooch mentioned in an 1829 newspaper article which mentions a similarly described brooch recently discovered alongside a hoard of coins in Rathkeale, located some 100 km from Roscrea.

It was acquired in 1867 by the Royal Irish Academy, Dublin, as part of a larger purchase of Petrie's entire collection, following his death the previous year. It is today on permanent display in the Treasury room of the National Museum of Ireland in Dublin.

Silver-gilt objects"," The Roscrea Brooch The Roscrea Brooch is a late 8th-century copper-alloy and enamel brooch from Ireland, which takes the form of a bent ring. It is highly decorated with fine enamel work, and is one of the few pieces of jewellery from the time and place to survive the Islamic invasion of Ireland in the early 9th century. It is named after the town of Roscrea, where it was found in the 19th century. The brooch is made of copper alloy, and is decorated with enamel work in a number of different colours. The general design is of a ring, bent in the centre. The ring is not perfectly round, and is made up of two half-ring parts which are not quite identical. The two half-rings are held together by a pin which passes through both of them, and then through a loose ring on the back. The pin is held in place by a catch. The brooch also has a hinge, allowing it to be folded in half for easier and safer storage. The enamel work is of the highest quality. The dominant colour is a translucent green, with yellow and blue enamel also used. The enamel work is used to decorate the brooch in a number of different ways. In some areas, it is used to create a geometric design, while in others it is used to create a cloisonsé effect. In some cases, the enamel is used to write letters of the Latin alphabet. The back of the brooch is decorated with a fleeced dog.

The headwaters of the stream are at  and the confluence with the Missouri is at . The source area for the stream lies just north of Interstate 70 west of the community of Eastville and the stream flows north turning east south of the community of Hatton. The stream gains the flow of Fourmile Branch and meanders to the east-southeast crossing under U.S. 54 between Auxvasse to the north and Kingdom City to the south. The stream turns southeast and passes under I-70 just northeast of the community of Calwood. The stream flows southeast to south passing the community of Toledo and turns southwest after gaining the tributary of Cow Creek north of Reform. West of Reform the stream gains the waters of Crows Fork Creek and turns south flowing past the Reform Conservation Area. Just west of Steedman the stream enters the Missouri River floodplain and crosses Missouri Route 94, and the floodplain to join the Missouri west of Chamois.

Auxvasse is a name derived from French meaning ""with mud"".

Rivers of Missouri"," Auxvasse Creek is a creek in northern Missouri. The creek is 45 miles (72 km) long and is a tributary of the Missouri River. The creek's name comes from the French word auxvasse, meaning ""reeds"" or ""willows."" The area along the creek was settled by French trappers and traders in the early 1700s. The French established a trading post at the mouth of the creek in the early 1800s. The trading post was later occupied by the Spanish and, in 1804, by the Lewis and Clark Expedition. The creek begins in northern Pettis County, Missouri, just south of the city of Sedalia. It flows west-southwest through northern Pettis and southern Boone counties, past the communities of Spickard, Auxvasse, and the western outskirts of Columbia. It joins the Missouri River in northern Cooper County, Missouri, about 4 miles (6.4 km) west of Boonville. The creek is a small, shallow stream, with a flow of about 65 cubic feet per second (1.7 m3/s). It is formed by the confluence of its East and West Forks, which are both about 25 miles (40 km) long. The East Fork begins in northern Pettis County, just south of the city of Sedalia, and flows south-southwest. The West Fork begins in western Pettis County, about 5 miles (8.0 km) west of the East Fork, and flows northwest. The two forks join near the community of Spickard. The creek's most significant tributary is Indian Creek, which flows into it from the east, just south of the city of Auxvasse. Indian Creek is about 15 miles (24 km) long and joins the creek in northern Boone County. The Missouri Department of Conservation owns and operates a conservation area along the creek, consisting of 1,200 acres (49 ha) of forest, meadows, and savanna. The area is known as the Auxvasse Creek Bottoms Conservation Area. It is located in northern Pettis and southern Boone counties, about 4 miles (6.4 km) west of the community of Sedalia. The conservation area was established in 1952 and includes a 4-mile (6.4 km) stretch of the creek. The area surrounding the creek is prone to flooding, and the creek has been the subject of a number of flood studies. A 2007 study by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) found that the 100-year floodplain for the creek was about 4,000 acres (1,600 ha) in size, and that the 25-year floodplain was about 2,000 acres (810 ha) in size. The FEMA study estimated that the 100-year flood had a peak flow rate of about 20000 cubic feet per second (5.5 m3/s), and that the 25-year flood had a peak flow rate of about 13000 cubic feet per second (3.7 m3/s).",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,51536715,0.0590717299578059,0.21052631578947367,0.13864619186303062,0.4470404984423676,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0.057484583596082876,0.02716926147965499,0.00041425020712510354,0.022113022113022112,4,2,0,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,6,1,1,1
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Ohms (album)"", the article should at least have 250 words","Ohms (stylized as _Ohms on physical editions) is the ninth studio album by American alternative metal band Deftones, released on September 25, 2020, through Reprise Records. The album was produced by Terry Date, making it their first collaboration since the unreleased Eros. The album was preceded by the release of two singles: ""Ohms"" and ""Genesis"". The song ""Ceremony"" was later released as a single. Ohms received critical acclaim from critics.

Background and production 
Deftones released their eighth studio album Gore on April 8, 2016, via Warner Bros. Records. As part of the album promotion, the band embarked on an extensive US tour in the summer of 2016, with support from Refused and Spotlights. The following summer, they performed a coheadlining North American tour with Rise Against, featuring support from Thrice. In 2018, Deftones hosted the first annual Dia de los Deftones festival at Petco Park, featuring performances from artists like Mike Shinoda, Rocket from the Crypt, and Doja Cat.

In a 2017 interview with NME, vocalist Chino Moreno said that Deftones had ""talked about getting together sooner [rather] than later"" on a new album. On March 28, 2018, the Deftones Instagram account shared images of the band at a recording studio, one of which was captioned ""Someone say jam?!"". That May, Moreno told Rock.com.AR that the band had ""six or seven new songs, which are still mutating"". Deftones provided another update on the album in April 2020, with drummer Abe Cunningham saying in an Instagram video that, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, ""it's been a bit difficult to get everyone in the same room"", but that they were in the process of mixing the new album, and were aiming for a late 2020 release date. Deftones worked with producer Terry Date on Ohms, their first collaboration since the unreleased Eros album in 2008. Recording took place at Henson Recording Studios in Los Angeles and Trainwreck Studios in Seattle.

Composition
Musically, Ohms is widely described as a return to the band's core alternative metal style. The album was also described as shoegaze and post-rock. Classic Rock magazine added a different assessment, calling the album ""dream pop with a metallic edge"". It is the first Deftones album since their eponymous 2003 album to be produced by Terry Date, although the band had worked with him during the sessions of the unreleased album Eros in 2008. It is also their first album in which Stephen Carpenter utilizes a nine-string guitar.

Packaging
The cover art was designed by Frank Maddocks, who has worked with Deftones on each of their albums since White Pony. There are a total of 12,995 dots on the cover art. Many fans believed that the design pays tribute to the band's original bassist Chi Cheng, who died in 2013, as the eyes that appear on the cover art line up closely with a photo of him. Band drummer Abe Cunningham stated in an interview that this was merely a coincidence, however. He added that the cover art idea reminded him of the 1980s, specifically the music video for Prince's 1984 song ""When Doves Cry"". Shortly before the album's release, Deftones launched the ""Adopt a Dot"" campaign, allowing for people to purchase one of the dots on the artwork as their own. A photo of the purchaser would then appear as the dot they purchased and be a part of the ""Ohms Adopt a Dot digital experience"" viewable online. All of the proceeds from the campaign were given to both the UC Davis Children's Hospital and Crew Nation relief fund.

Promotion
The band began teasing the album's release with a week-long digital campaign in August 2020. Deftones released cryptic social media posts, their official website and animations through Spotify's Canvas feature that when solved revealed the word ""ohms"" and longitudinal coordinates for a billboard in Los Angeles teasing the album artwork. The campaign concluded with a formal announcement for Ohms and a music video for the album's lead single, ""Ohms"". The music video for ""Ohms"" was directed by Rafatoon and featured what Rolling Stone described as, ""band performance video interspersed with scenes from a dystopian world, mirroring the musically and lyrically heavy song sentiments."" At the time of release, vocalist Chino Moreno described ""Ohms"" as a ""a good scope of where this record's at,"" though in a separate interview producer Terry Date didn't feel like the song was a good choice for the album's lead promotional track.

Deftones were originally scheduled to tour North America in support of Ohms with Gojira and Poppy in July to September 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the tour was postponed until 2021.

Reception

Ohms received critical acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, the album received an average score of 87, based on 21 reviews, indicating ""universal acclaim"". AllMusic critic Neil Z. Yeung thought that Deftones ""take their signature beauty-meets-brutality assault, searching for balance across a tightly focused ten tracks."" Yeung further stated: ""As a unit, they haven't sounded this refreshed in years."" Consequence of Sound's Joseph Schafer described Ohms as ""their hardest-hitting effort in years"" and ""a record that hints at a purified blend of their contrasting influences in its finest moments."" Ben Tipple of DIY praised Date's production work and stated: ""If any of Deftones’ previous records are guilty of lacking focus (you decide), ‘Ohms‘ is certainly safe from future vitriol.""

Describing Ohms as ""truly and honestly a breath of fresh air,"" Exclaim! critic Adam Wallis thought that the record was ""just as unique and innovative as each album before it."" The Independents Roisin O'Connor regarded the album as ""an intriguing addition to the band’s canon,"" while David McLaughlin from Kerrang! likened it to  a ""greatest hits [record] from a parallel plane of existence, yet dense enough to demand deeper exploration."" Writing for NME, James McMahon described Ohms as ""heavy stuff, both sonically and in emotional clout."" Andy Crump of Paste regarded the album as ""an engrossing refinement of what they’ve become over years of risk-taking and experimentation."" Sputnikmusic staff critic SowingSeason thought that the record ""surpasses Deftones’ other iconic releases is in its dense, unpredictable layering and sheer intensity."" He further stated: ""There aren’t many traits present on Ohms that we’ve never heard from the band before,... but they’ve woven all these glimpses of previous albums together and improved upon them in nearly every facet.""

In a more mixed review, The Guardians Dean Van Nguyen wrote that the album ""lacks the lateral thinking that distinguished the band’s masterpiece, White Pony."" Nevertheless, Nguyen further explained: ""Still, by streamlining their sound, Deftones have made an album that proves that ferocity is not a diminishing resource."" Andy Cush at Pitchfork was also more reserved in his praise for the album than most critics, claiming the band are ""not attempting to radically shift your notion of what their music can be. For those of us who have stuck around, that’s just fine; a Deftones album that effortlessly twists their familiar components into a few genuinely new shapes is plenty exciting""

""Genesis"" and ""Ohms"" are currently nominated for Best Metal Performance and Best Rock Performance, respectively, at the 64th Grammy Awards.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Daniel J. Sandin"", the article should at least have 250 words","Daniel J. Sandin (born 1942) is an American video and computer graphics artist, designer and researcher. He is a Professor Emeritus of the School of Art & Design at University of Illinois at Chicago, and co-director of the Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) at the University of Illinois at Chicago. He is an internationally recognized pioneer in computer graphics, electronic art and visualization.

Biography
Dan Sandin received his B.A. in Natural Sciences from Shimer College in 1964 and his M.S. in Physics from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1967. He became interested in video in 1967, while helping to organize student demonstrations at the University of Illinois. In 1969, he joined as a teacher at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), in order to bring technology into the arts program. This was shortly after his presentation of ""Glowflow"", a computer controlled light and sound system, created with Myron Krueger, Jerry Erdman, and Richard Venezky. By 1972, Thomas A. DeFanti joined UIC and together with Sandin they founded the Circle Graphics Habitat, now known as the Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL).

In 2018 Sandin's work, the Sandin Image Processor and the Sayre Glove, was included in the Chicago New Media 1973-1992 exhibition, curated by jonCates. He also gave a demonstration of Particle Dreams in Spherical Harmonics in the CAVE 2 system, and was part of the symposium both of which were connected to the exhibition as a series of events.

His major achievements were working on a series of projects including: Glowflow (1969), Sandin Image Processor (IP) (1971–1973), Sayre Glove (1977), PHSColograms (1988), CAVE (1992) and ImmersaDesk and Infinity Wall.

Awards 
Dan Sandin received several awards including: the Guggenheim Fellowships awarded for video and sound in 1978, the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) for video art (with Stevenson Palfi) in 1981, the Rockefeller Foundation's Video Fellowship in 1981, the Inventor of the Year award from the University of Illinois in 2000, and the Rockefeller Foundation's Film, Video and Multimedia Fellowship in 2002 for ""Looking for Water 2,"" a virtual-reality, 3-D installation.

Work
Dan Sandin has said that his career has three main objectives: 
 the design of electronic instruments and computer programs for visual performance and personal growth;
 the development of educational facilities and programs related to the use of electronic screens; and
 the production and exhibition of computer processed visual works for personal expressive reasons.

Sandin Image Processor
 From 1971 to 1973, he designed the Sandin Image Processor, a patch programmable analog computer for real-time manipulation of video inputs through the control of the grey level information. His friend and neighbor Phil Morton helped with the early schematic plans diagram. This modular design was based on the Moog synthesizer. With Tom DeFanti, he would combine it with real-time computer graphics and synthesized music and perform visual concerts. He has performed worldwide and has received grants in support of his work from the Rockefeller Foundation (1981), the National Science Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts (1980) and the Guggenheim Foundation (1978). His piece ""Spiral PTL"" was one of the first pieces included in the Museum of Modern Art's video art collection.

The Sayre Glove
In 1977, with Tom DeFanti and Rich Sayre, he designed the Sayre Glove, the first data glove, as part of a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. This device used light based sensors with flexible tubes with a light source at one end and a photocell at the other. As the fingers were bent, the amount of light that hit the photocells varied, thus providing a measure of finger flexion. It was mainly used to manipulate sliders, but was lightweight and inexpensive.

PHSColograms

By 1988, Sandin was working on a type of digital photography called PHSColograms; a system whereby a number of still images were situated in an autostereoscopic manner and back-projected with light. The effect was very similar to holograms and many times viewers would mistake them as such. The initial system supported roughly 13 images but further improvements now could easily allow 100 such images to be used. This system was designed primarily for use in the medical field where these quasi-3D images could benefit surgeons.

Cave Automatic Virtual Environment

The first CAVE was invented by Carolina Cruz-Neira, Daniel J. Sandin, and Thomas A. DeFanti in 1992. This is an immersive system that became the standard for rear projection-based Virtual Reality systems. The normal full system consists of projections screens along the front, side and floor axes, and a tracking system for the ""user"". Although they used the recursive acronym Cave Automatic Virtual Environment for the CAVE system, the name also refers to Plato's ""Republic"" and ""The Allegory of the Cave"" where he explored the concepts of reality and human perception.

Since then there have been a couple offshoots of the CAVE technology, including ImmersaDesk, Infinity Wall and Oblong Industries' G-speak system.  The ImmersaDesk is a semi-immersive system, resembling a drafting table, while the Infinity Wall is designed to cater to an entire room of people, such as a conference room. Extending this concept, G-speak supports gestural input from multiple-users and multiple-devices on and expandable array of monitors.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Academy of Saint Joseph"", the article should at least have 250 words","The Academy of Saint Joseph, in Brentwood, New York, was a Catholic college-preparatory school for  Kindergarten to Grade 12, single-sex for girls grades 9 - 12. The academy was founded in 1856, by the Sisters of Saint Joseph named after Saint Joseph. At the request of the Bishop of Brooklyn, Mother Austin Kean came from Philadelphia to Brooklyn to found what is now the Sisters of St. Joseph of Brentwood, New York. She was accompanied by Sister Baptista Hanson and Sister Theodosia Hegeman from Buffalo.  It closed in 2009, after a 153-year history of educating the youth of Brooklyn, Queens and Long Island.

Situated on a  campus, it was accredited by the New York State Board of Regents and by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools and held full membership in the New York State Association of Independent Schools and the National Catholic Educational Association.  It was operated independent of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rockville Centre. The Academy of St. Joseph had been having financial problems for over a decade before its closure.

Lower school
The Lower School was staffed by a highly qualified lay and religious faculty. Small class sizes provided frequent interaction between teacher and student. In addition to the grade level teacher, there were special teachers in the fields of Music, Visual Art, Romance Languages, and Physical Education. The curriculum offered in the Lower School was child-centered, integrative, holistic, and exceeded NYS Learning Standards. Emphasis on literacy and whole language began in Kindergarten and continued throughout the grades.

Middle school
The Middle School provided for girls and boys grades 6 - 8 an intermediate level of study before high school.  Guided by the CSJ Mission Statement, the students developed a sense of tolerance, acceptance and respect for themselves and each other.  Caring faculty challenged students in  subject classes scheduled in collaboration with the secondary division.  Class meetings, field trips, ceremonies and celebrations fostered a sense of community.

High school
The High School curriculum of the Academy of St. Joseph for grades 9-12 was college preparatory. Emphasis was placed on the development of skill in the process of learning as well as on the academic content. A number of traditions encouraged camaraderie among the academy's young women. A feature of the curriculum was the four-year Humanities program which integrated Art, Music, History and Literature. Advanced Placement Courses were scheduled in American and European History, Art, English, Chemistry, Biology and Calculus.

""The high school amplified the abilities of the young women that attended by having small intimate class in which time with the teacher was individualized.""

""The large amount of land that the school sat on made physical education fun and exciting.""

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Gulf of Aden"", the article should at least have 250 words","The Gulf of Aden (,  𐒅𐒖𐒐𐒕𐒌 𐒋𐒖𐒆𐒗𐒒) is a deepwater gulf between Yemen to the north, the Arabian Sea to the east, Djibouti to the west, and the Guardafui Channel, Socotra (Yemen), Somaliland and Somalia to the south. In the northwest, it connects with the Red Sea through the Bab-el-Mandeb strait, and it connects with the Arabian Sea to the east. To the west, it narrows into the Gulf of Tadjoura in Djibouti. 

The ancient Greeks regarded the gulf as one of the most important parts of the Erythraean Sea. It later came to be dominated by Muslims, as the area around the gulf converted to Islam. From the late 1960s onwards, there started to be an increased Soviet naval presence in the Gulf. The importance of the Gulf of Aden declined when the Suez Canal was closed, but it was revitalized when the canal was reopened in 1975, after being deepened and widened by the Egyptian government.

The waterway is part of the important Suez Canal shipping route between the Mediterranean Sea and the Arabian Sea in the Indian Ocean, with 21,000 ships crossing the gulf annually. This route is often used for the delivery of Persian Gulf oil, making the gulf an integral waterway in the world economy. Important cities along the Gulf of Aden include the namesake Aden in Yemen. Other Yemeni cities are Zinjibar, Shuqrah, Ahwar, Balhaf, Mukalla. On the Horn African side, the cities of Djibouti, and Bosaso.

Despite a lack of large-scale commercial fishing facilities, the coastline supports many isolated fishing towns and villages. The Gulf of Aden is richly supplied with fish, turtles, and lobsters. Local fishing takes place close to the shore; sardines, tuna, kingfish, and mackerel make up the bulk of the annual catches. Crayfish and sharks are also fished locally.

Historical Names

In antiquity, the modern-day Gulf of Aden was seen as an extension of the Erythraean Sea (Red Sea) , Erythrà Thálassa in Ancient Greek geography. The Greeks named several islands within the gulf, including Stratonis Insula, although it is no longer clear which existing islands had which Greek names.

In Abu'l-Fida's, A Sketch of the Countries (), the present-day Gulf of Aden was called the Gulf of Berbera, which shows how important Berbera was in both regional and international trade during the medieval period.

Legendary navigator Ibn Majid referred to the Gulf of Aden as the Gulf of Berbera in his 15th century magnum opus The Book of the Benefits of the Principles and Foundations of Seamanship. In his description of the Somali coast and wider Indian Ocean he used the then contemporary reference to the Gulf as being named after Berbera like Abu'l-Fida before him. Berbera has been a prominent port since antiquity

Geography

Limits
The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Gulf of Aden as follows:

On the west – The southern limit of the Red Sea [A line joining Hisn Murad () and Ras Siyyan ()].

On the west – The eastern limit of the Gulf of Tadjoura (A line joining Obock and Lawyacado).

On the East – The Arabian Sea.

Hydrography
The temperature of the Gulf of Aden varies between  and , depending on the season and the appearance of monsoons. The salinity of the gulf at  depth varies from 35.3 ‰ along the eastern Somali coast to as high as 37.3 ‰ in the gulf's center, while the oxygen content in the Gulf of Aden at the same depth is typically between 4.0 and 5.0 mg/L.

Exclusive economic zone
Exclusive economic zones in Gulf of Aden:

Economy

The Gulf of Aden is a vital waterway for shipping, especially for Persian Gulf oil, making it an integral waterway in the world economy.  Approximately 11% of the world's seaborne petroleum passes through the Gulf of Aden on its way to the Suez Canal or to regional refineries. The main ports along the gulf are Aden, Balhaf, Bir Ali, Mukalla, and Shokra in Yemen; Djibouti City in Djibouti; Zeila, Berbera, Maydh and Las Khorey in Somaliland and Bosaso in Somalia.

In antiquity, the gulf was a thriving area of international trade between Ptolemaic Egypt and Rome in the west and Classical India, its Indonesian colonies, and Han China in the east. It was not limited to transshipment, as Yemeni incense, tortoiseshell, and other goods were in high demand in both directions. After Egyptian sailors discovered the monsoon winds and began to trade directly with India, caravan routes and their associated kingdoms began to collapse, leading to a rise in piracy in the area.  The 1st-century Periplus of the Erythraean Sea documents one Egyptian captain's experiences during this era.

After the collapse of the Roman economy, direct trade ceased but the Awsan I port Crater, located just south of the modern city of Aden, remained an important regional center. In late antiquity and the early medieval period, there were several invasions of Yemen from Ethiopia; after the rise of Islam, the gulf permitted repeated migrations of northwest Africa by Arab settlers.

In the late 2000s, the gulf evolved into a hub of pirate activity. By 2013, attacks in the waters had steadily declined due to active private security and international navy patrols. India receives US$50 billion in imports and sends US$60 billion in exports through this area annually. Due to this, and for the sake of protecting the trade of other countries, India keeps a warship escort in this area.

Ecology

A geologically young body of water, the Gulf of Aden has a unique biodiversity that contains many varieties of fish, coral, seabirds and invertebrates. This rich ecological diversity has benefited from a relative lack of pollution during the history of human habitation around the gulf. However, environmental groups fear that the lack of a coordinated effort to control pollution may jeopardize the gulf's ecosphere. Whales, dolphins, and dugongs were once common before being severely reduced by commercial hunts, including by mass illegal hunts by Soviet Union and Japan in 1960s to 70s. Critically endangered Arabian humpback whales were once seen in large numbers, but only a few large whales still appear in the gulf waters,  including Bryde's whales, blue whales, and toothed whales inhabiting deep-seas such as sperm whales and tropical bottlenose whales.

Western Indo-Pacific"," Gulf of Aden The Gulf of Aden (Boqol Adan) is a body of water separating the Arabian Peninsula from the island of Socotra and the African continent. It is the northeasternmost part of the Arabian Sea. It connects with the Red Sea to the north via the strait of Mandab. Its western part is known as the Gulf of Berbera. In the northeast, it connects with the Indian Ocean via the strait of Bab-el-Mandab. The gulf covers an area of 134700 km2, and its mean depth is 3,325 m. It is the third largest body of water in theArabian Sea. The name Gulf of Aden is derived from the name of the city of Aden, which is located at the eastern end of the gulf. The ancient Greeks called it the ""Arabian Gulf"". The British, who historically had influence in the area, called it the ""Gulf of Aden"". The region was divided into the British Aden Protectorate and the Aden Colony. The city of Aden was the capital of the British Colony and, at one point, was the capital of the entire British Protectorate. The modern-day Republic of Yemen inherited the colony and the city after achieving independence in 1967. The economy of the area is based on shipping, oil, and trade through the port of Aden. The region is also rich in marine life and is a popular destination for anglers. Shipping in the Gulf of Aden is under threat from piracy. In 2008, the International Maritime Bureau reported that the region was the most dangerous for shipping in the world, with 42 attacks that year. In response to the increase in pirate attacks, the Gulf of Aden is now patrolled by a multi-national naval force.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,58716,0.05063291139240506,0.14736842105263157,0.1546657171811235,0.20093457943925233,5,8,0,0,6,1,1,0,0,0,0.13700884545478742,0.018566373815058382,0.002347417840375587,0.018427518427518427,11,1,10,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,1,27,1,1,0
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Travel Companion Exchange"", the article should at least have 250 words","Travel Companion Exchange (TCE) was a travel companion matching service established by Jens Jurgen in 1982. As the first general interest travel companion matching service in existence, it became the forerunner of many similar services and helped pioneer and legitimize the field of singles matching services in general. It was the largest  and most successful of its type at the time.

History 
While traveling alone through Europe Jurgen developed the idea for a companion matching service for travelers. He already was operating a similar program for members who shared a common interest in the arts, and he had written several short books on travel subjects. Using the mailing list of those who had contacted him with inquiries about the books, he sent a questionnaire to gauge their interest in finding a travel companion. Met with an overwhelming positive response, he commenced on the larger service.

Initially, his goal was to provide a service that would help travelers save money by sharing expenses, particularly to avoid the single supplement levied by cruise ship operators. He did not at first think that the service would serve as a matchmaker. However, he found that more than 70 percent of his clients either requested companions of the opposite sex or were willing to accept them; fewer than 15 percent wanted private rooms.

He developed a profile questionnaire that identified key personal habits and preferences that would impact on compatibility while traveling. After completing the questionnaire and mailing it to the TCE office, members were mailed a monthly summary of the profiles of all members with current travel plans or desires. They could then request the full profiles and contact information for those they were interested in.

The novelty and utility of the service soon resulted in write-ups in major publications like the Los Angeles Times  and Prevention magazine, which generated a flood of inquiries. As a result, the business grew quickly, and within a year it had 2,500 active members in 48 states, Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico and Japan. By 1997 it had served over 70,000 members. No figures are available for the total number of members it had in the full 20 years it was in operation.

The monthly mailings were accompanied by a newsletter in which Jurgen shared tips drawn from his wealth of experience in the travel sector, and from the contributions of members and other travel professionals. This newsletter was rated by Newsday as ""one of the three best general travel newsletters.""

The profile was so successful in indicating potentially compatible partners that the service suffered an unusually high turn-over due to members finding a permanent partner and dropping their memberships.

Jurgen operated the business out of his home in Amityville, NY, at first alone, then with staff made necessary by the increased workload. Competing services soon sprang up, and they began to use the Internet, reaching a larger audience at a lower cost. Jurgen, however, resisted transferring TCE to the Web due to his concern over the privacy and safety of his members, citing the difficulty of verifying the identity of online applicants. He did, however, put up home pages which directed visitors to the mailing address and phone numbers of the Amityville office.

Jurgen closed the business in 2003 for personal reasons.

Founder 
Originally from Germany, Jurgen was a mechanical engineer who worked for Long Island Light Co. While there, he started the employees' travel program, chartering flights to Europe, and began researching and writing on travel subjects. In 1976, after a divorce, he quit his job and toured Europe in an RV for three years.

Jurgen wrote and self-published several books during his career, including:
Guide to Air Charter Groups and Air Travel Bargains (1967)
European Car Ferry Services (1971) and
Air Travel & Charter Flight Handbook (1973)
The latter book led to his being called as an expert witness on air travel matters before a US Senate Committee which ultimately led to the airline deregulation hearings.

These books also brought such a quantity of inquiries by mail that he organized his own charter travel club and operated it until 1973.

He continued to write and publish other travel titles:
Charter Flight Directory, subtitled ""How To Fly for Less"" (1976,1977 and 1978 editions) and
1001 sources for Free Travel Information  – Valuable Freebies You Should Know About (1978)
Accumulated tips from the TCE newsletter were compiled into a 24-page booklet called Foiling Pickpockets and Other Travel-related Scams (1997 and 2000 editions) which became recognized as the best consumer guide available  and Jurgen was frequently quoted in articles on the subject.
The titles were all well received by the public, and in total, he sold approximately 120,000 copies of the books.

In 1997, he married Eul Lee, whom he had met through TCE. She became his partner in the business as well – in fact, the demands of the work were such that they could only drive to Philadelphia for a few days for their honeymoon.

Revival 
After his retirement, Jurgen retained ownership of the domain names he had used for TCE as well as several other travel related domains. In 2011 he sold the www.travelcompanionexchange.com domain to a former member of TCE, who revived it as an Internet-only travel companion matching service.

American travel websites
American social networking websites"," Travel Companion Exchange A travel companion is a person who travels with another person, or group of people, for various reasons. A travel companion may be a friend, a family member, a co-worker, or a total stranger. Many travel companions are found through specialized websites and services, or through social networking sites. A travel companion is a convenient way to travel with another person, and is often desirable for single travelers, or for people traveling to a country for the first time. Travel companions can provide many benefits, such as sharing the travel experience, reducing the cost of the trip, and providing another level of safety. However, there are also risks associated with traveling with a companion, such as disagreements over the trip itinerary, costs, or activities. There are a number of ways to find a travel companion. Many people use social networking sites, such as Facebook or Twitter, to find friends or acquaintances who are interested in traveling. Others use specialized websites, such as Travelocity or Expedia, to find travel companions. These websites allow users to post their travel plans, and to search for other users who are interested in traveling to the same destination. Once you have found a travel companion, it is important to make sure you are compatible with them. This will help to ensure that you have a successful trip. You should also make sure that you are both clear on the terms of the trip, such as the cost, the itinerary, and the activities that you will be doing.

20th-century symphonies"," Symphony No. 4 (Szymanowski) Symphony No. 4 was begun in late 1927, and completed in early 1928, although its performance was delayed until 1930 because its composer was unhappy with the first version. It is dedicated to the memory of Tadeusz Szeligowski, Szymanowski's friend and former teacher, who had died in 1924. The work is in three movements, although the third is labeled as an ""Intermezzo"". The first movement is in sonata form, with a theme (which becomes the basis of the entire symphony) presented in the first few bars. A subsidiary theme appears in the developmental section, and the movement ends with a restatement of the main theme. The second movement is in A-B-A form. The A section is based on a song-like theme, while the B section is more animated. The symphony's main theme returns in the A section of the third movement, which is in rondo form. The theme is repeated in a major key, then a minor key, followed by a brief developmental section. The coda brings the symphony to a close by repeating the theme once more in a major key. The symphony is scored for a large orchestra, including three flutes (third doubling piccolo), three oboes (third doubling English horn), three clarinets (third doubling E-flat clarinet and bass clarinet), three bassoons (third doubling contrabassoon), six horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, two percussionists, and strings.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Nobles Emigrant Trail"", the article should at least have 250 words","The Nobles Emigrant Trail, also known as the Fort Kearney, South Pass and Honey Lake Wagon Road, is a trail in California that was used by emigrant parties from the east as a shortened route to northern California. It was pioneered in 1851 by William Nobles, who discovered an easy shortcut between the Applegate Trail in Nevada and the Lassen Trail in California. The trail was extensively used until the 1870s, when it was superseded by railroads.

Discovery and establishment
The main trail to California in the 1840s was the California Trail, which followed the Humboldt River in Nevada, then the Truckee River, and over the Donner Pass in California. A northern variation was pioneered by the Applegate brothers in 1846, using a more northerly route that connected with destinations in Oregon. Peter Lassen established a variant route that passed Lassen Peak on the way to the Sacramento area. Lassen scouted the area of Honey Lake with William H. Nobles for a legendary ""Gold Lake"", but having failed, they parted company, with Nobles continuing to the east and accidentally scouting a shorter, easier trail than Lassen's.

Nobles, born in New York in 1816, had moved to Minnesota in 1841 to work as a carpenter, then as a carpenter and wagon-maker. By 1851 he had moved on to California. When Nobles returned to California from his expedition with Lassen, he showed a party of  businessmen the route for a fee of $2000. With the subscribers vouching for the usefulness of the  route, he returned to Minnesota in 1853 to promote the route, marrying in Illinois along the way. The Minnesota legislature commissioned Nobles to present the route to Congress in Washington. Nobles' efforts persuaded Congress to appropriate $300,000 for an expedition along the route, led by Frederick W. Lander, who prepared a favorable report in February 1861. The route became known as the Fort Kearney, South Pass and Honey Lake Wagon Road. Nobles was elected to the Minnesota Territorial Legislature and died in St. Paul in 1876. The trail was briefly considered for a railroad route. Its popularity contributed to the founding of Susanville and Redding.

Historic designation
The  section of trail within the boundaries of Lassen Volcanic National Park was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 3, 1975. The section within the park is maintained as a hiking trail.

The trail has two California Historical Landmark markers: #675 marks a stopping place along the Noble Emigrant Trail that William Nobles established near the present-day city of Susanville, while #677 marks the spot where Peter Lassen first saw Honey Lake on October 4, 1850, while on his search for ""Gold Lake"".

Lassen Volcanic National Park
The trail within the park starts in the northeast corner, passing the edge of the Cinder Cone and the Fantastic Lava Beds, then skirting Prospect Peak. Crossing Badger Flats and passing through the Devastated Area associated with the May 21, 1915 eruption of Lassen Peak. The trail parallels the Lassen Park Road, then passes between the Chaos Crags and Table Mountain, across Sunflower Flat and over Nobles Pass, following the edge of the Chaos Jumbles. The trail leaves the northwest corner of the park near Manzanita Lake.

It is a 5-mile (8.0 km) route in Yamhill County that was used by oxen trains and horse riders on the way to the Oregon Territory from 1842 to 1850. The route was blazed by Robert Nobles, an emigrant from Illinois who traveled to the region in 1840. It was designated a historic trail in 1980. The trail begins at a spot on the Willamette River near the present-day community of Scholls, Oregon, and heads south to the present-day community of Newberg. In the early 1840s, Robert Nobles and his traveling companions were the first whites to use the trail. The group included Joseph Meek, who later became a prominent figure in the region. Meek was one of the first to document the trail, as he did in a letter he wrote in 1843 to theeditor of the Oregon Spectator.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Wuppertal Hauptbahnhof"", the article should at least have 250 words","Wuppertal Hauptbahnhof (German for Wuppertal main station) is a railway station in the city of Wuppertal, just south of the Ruhr Area, in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia.  It is on the line between Düsseldorf/Cologne and Dortmund. The 1848 reception building is one of the oldest of its kind. The station was originally Elberfeld station and has been renamed several times since. Since 1992, it has been called Wuppertal Hauptbahnhof. Wuppertal Hauptbahnhof is also the site of lost luggage operations for Deutsche Bahn.

History

On 3 September 1841, a few years after the opening of the first railway in Germany, the Dusseldorf-Elberfeld Railway Company (German: Düsseldorf-Elberfelder Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft, DEE) began operation of the Düsseldorf–Elberfeld line from its Düsseldorf station to its Elberfeld station (now Wuppertal-Steinbeck station). It was the first steam-worked railway line in Western Germany and Prussia.

The Bergisch-Märkische Railway Company (Bergisch-Märkische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft, BME), opened its Elberfeld–Dortmund railway from its Elberfeld station (known as Döppersberg station) via Hagen to Dortmund to Schwelm on 9 October 1847. It was extended to Hagen and Dortmund on 20 December 1848. The BME took over the DEE in 1857.

The first provisional station building became inadequate within a few years. It was decided to build a new building, designed by Hauptner and Ebeling and opened in 1850 on a new section of line connecting the BME and DEE lines, which was completed on 9 March 1849. Around 1900, a protruding porch was built in front of the ground floor, which conflicted with the architectural design.  Nevertheless, this concept was maintained after its reconstruction after World War II.  
This will only change with the completion of the current renovation of the station/Döppersberg area.

The station has been renamed several times. It was first called Elberfeld, but a few years later it was renamed Elberfeld-Döppersberg and before the First World War it was renamed Elberfeld Hauptbahnhof. In the early 1930s the station's name was changed to Wuppertal-Elberfeld station as a consequence of the merger of the towns of Elberfeld and Barmen as the city of Wuppertal. Finally in 1992, it was renamed Wuppertal Hauptbahnhof.

Station buildings
The station building is located next to platform track 1 and is connected by a tunnel to tracks 2–5. Above the entrance, near the old Reichsbahn railway division of Elberfeld, there are four pillars supporting the roof. The building is connected by the 200-metre-long Döppersberg pedestrian tunnel directly with central Elberfeld and the Wuppertal Hbf (Döppersberg) Schwebebahn (monorail) station.

A McDonald's restaurant has been established in the premises of the former baggage check-in and in the tunnel under the entrance there a large newsagency/book shop and a bakery. The low building in front of the historic station building houses a pharmacy. In front of the entrance to the station there is a parking area, including a taxi stand, and nearby there is an Inter City Hotel.

Architecture
The original building is one of the oldest big city railway stations in Germany. It is a three-storey ashlar building bounded by tower-like corner projections. The main entrance in the middle of the building is a four-columned portico, with emphasised Corinthian capitals and has strong antique ornamentation. The ground floor originally had arched openings and it has six rectangular windows on each level and on each side of the portico. It was necessary in 1900 to build a ground-floor entrance porch to cater for the growing need for space for counters and waiting rooms.

The station is part of an ensemble of buildings built in neoclassical style, which is grouped around the railway station forecourt. On the western side of the square is the headquarters of the former Reichsbahn railway division of Elberfeld; on the eastern side there used to be the headquarters of the Chief General Manager, but thus was torn down after the Second World War.

The construction of the station was accompanied by extensive urban development in the Döppersberg area. The Döppersberg bridge (Döppersberger Brücke) was built to connect centre of old Elberfeld with the station over the Wupper.

Reconstruction since 2014
The entire area around the station has been extensively reconstructed, finishing in 2018. The main goal was to create a continuous pedestrian and shopping area connecting the station to the city centre, as is already the case in many other German cities, such as Cologne, Stuttgart or Hanover. The B 7 which is a very busy arterial road, was relocated to a tunnel, while a pedestrian zone was built above it.
 
Preparations began in the summer of 2009, and the opening ceremony for work on the new, modernised station was held on 30 June 2009. Since the completion of the work in 2018, it has had a two-storey shopping level, a large station forecourt, which was built on the former Bahnhofstrasse, and a bridge and café over the B 7, which was lowered by about seven metres. A new bus station has replaced the bus stops that were previously on the B 7. It was built above a 200-space car park next to the station. Instead of a glass cube—which had previously been planned—a striking building with a bronze-coloured facade was built, which contains a Primark branch.
 
The modernisation of the Deutsche Bahn entrance building at an expected cost of €12.4 million started in 2014. This modernisation was expected to be completed in 2016.
 
In the course of the renovation, bus services were temporarily relocated from the street of Döppersberg to the districts of Ohligsmühle and Wall at the timetable change in July 2014. First Döppersberg was lowered from the end of October 2012 and then the eastern part of the station lobby was demolished from the end of February 2013. The tenancies in this area—pharmacy, pub, bank branch, bakery and fast food restaurant—were terminated in autumn 2012 and they were closed. The DB Travel Center was temporarily located in a shipping container at the western end of platform 1.
 
The B 7 was closed in July 2014 and the superstructure of the Döppersberg bridge was removed in August 2014. The pedestrian tunnel ending there was closed in January 2015. Instead, a steel replacement pedestrian bridge crossed the B-7 construction site. This involved a 300-metre-long walk around the station building. The B 7 was reopened to traffic in July 2017.
 
A computer-based interlocking was put into operation in the Wuppertal area at the end of August 2017. This involved the installation of 387 sets of signals, 98 sets of points and 374 kilometres of cable. In addition, track and overhead line work was pending. The station was completely closed for work during the Easter and summer holidays in 2017. A total of 90 replacement buses were operated.
 
The restoration of the historic entrance building was originally the responsibility of Deutsche Bahn, which wanted to find a private investor to carry out the restoration and subsequent operation by the spring of 2019. Deutsche Bahn also planned to sell some land at the station on which various ancillary buildings now stand to the municipal utility company, which intended to build the valley station of the planned Wuppertal cable car there. However, this project was abandoned after 61.6% of the participants voted against it in a citizens' poll on 26 May 2019. According to its own statement, Deutsche Bahn is in talks with ""multiple interests"". The selection process was stopped in the meantime to await the results of the citizens' survey and will continue after the decision of the town council to end the cable car project. However, it was not to be expected that the sale would be concluded in 2019.
 

 
A public piano has been located in the station hall since November 2018.

Services
Although the station possesses only five tracks, less than the other stations of the city, all services running through Wuppertal stop here, except for the S 68 S-Bahn service terminating in Vohwinkel.

Long-distance trains stop every 30 minutes on platforms 1 and 2 running in either direction. ICE line 10 (Cologne–Berlin) provides a direct connection to Berlin in under four hours.

It was built in 1847 and is the oldest railway station still in operation in Germany. The station is located in the city centre at the eastern end of the ""Crown Street"" (Kronenstrasse), the central shopping street of Wuppertal. It is the main transport hub of the city, connecting Wuppertal with other cities in Germany and the surrounding region. The station is served by Regional-Express and Regionalbahn services as well as by four S-Bahn lines. The station was built by the Bergisch Gladbach Railway Company (BGL) as the eastern terminus of their Crumscheid–Wuppertal railway line, which was opened on 1 June 1847. The line was extended to Düsseldorf on 20 April 1848. The BGL was taken over by the Bergisch-Märkische Railway Company (BME) in 1856, which in turn was taken over by the Prussian state railways in 1880. The original station building was replaced by a new one in 1887. The current station building was erected in 1914/15 to a design by the architect Alexander Neckel. The building, in the style of the late New Renaissance, is a protected monument. The station was severely damaged during the Second World War. It was rebuilt in 1950/51 to a design by the architect Karl Stüner in the style of the early post-war period. The station was modernised in 1996/97. In 2005, the platform next to the station building was raised to provide a level access to the trains. In 2009, the station was modernised and the platforms were refurbished.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""National Civil War Museum"", the article should at least have 250 words","The National Civil War Museum, located at One Lincoln Circle at Reservoir Park in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, is a permanent, nonprofit educational institution created to promote the preservation of material culture and sources of information that are directly relevant to the American Civil War of 1861–1865, and the aftermath period of the war as related to Civil War Veterans' service organizations, including the Grand Army of the Republic, United Confederate Veterans and the Daughters of the Confederacy to 1920. The museum also serves as the National Headquarters for the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War (SUVCW), the legal successor to the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR). In 2009, the museum became affiliated with the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.

History
Former Harrisburg Mayor Steve Reed, a Civil War enthusiast, was behind the museum's development, which cost 32 million dollars. The museum opened to the public in 2001. It is now privately owned, and has an association with the Smithsonian Institution. Recently, the Museum published a book about the Union General Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, one of many planned books the museum hopes to publish.

Location
The museum is located in a two-story brick building in Harrisburg's Reservoir Park in the Allison Hill neighborhood. The exhibits and self-guided tour begin on the second floor of the museum (first ten galleries) and continue on the first floor (last seven galleries and theater). A gift shop, temporary exhibit gallery, and museum support are on the first floor. A ""Walk of Valor,"" consisting of red bricks bearing the names of Civil War veterans who have been honored by their surviving descendants, contributes to the museum's memorial-like grounds. It also shows pictures of the current president that was congratulating some of the honored veterans at a ceremony. The museum also serves as National Headquarters of the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War. Prices for entry are: Adults (18+) $13, Seniors (60+) $12, Students (6+) $11,
and a Family Pass is $48.

Exhibits
The museum's exhibits are designed to tell ""the entire story of the American Civil War ... without bias to the Union or Confederate causes."" The exhibition covers the period from 1850 to 1876, with its major focus on the Civil War years of 1861 to 1865. The majority of the collection of over 24,000 artifacts, photographs, documents, manuscripts, and other printed matter was acquired between 1994 and 1999 by the city of Harrisburg, under Mayor Stephen R. Reed, who is the museum's founder. Three-dimensional objects (artifacts) comprise about 3,500 items, of which one-fourth (850 items) are on display in the permanent galleries of the building.  The balance is held in secure storage for future exhibits and for scholarly research, the latter reserved for Museum members and by appointment only.

The museum's galleries are as follows:
 A House Divided, 1850–1860 (examines the events leading up to the Civil War); Highlights a speech given by Abraham Lincoln in Washington D.C. in 1860, in which he claimed that a house divided cannot stand. 
 American Slavery: The Peculiar Institution, 1850–1860 (how nineteenth-century Americans saw slavery);
 First Shots, April 1861 (Fort Sumter); The first battle and start of the war

 Weapons and Equipment (with many artifacts); Disease continued to cause most war deaths, but conscription and massive armies, more powerful and accurate weapons, and civilian targets increased casualties in the mid-1800 conflicts and later wars.
 Campaigns and Battles of 1861–1862 (early campaigns and the tactics, strategies. and logistics);
 Battle Map, 1861–1862 (emphasis on how geography and topography affected troop movements);
 Camp Curtin (the Civil War's largest Union camp, located in Harrisburg);
 Why Men Fought, 1861–1863 (motivations of soldiers on both sides);
 Civil War Music (displays of musical instruments and recorded music to listen to);
 Gettysburg, 1863 (a turning point of the war); Total casualties of nearly 50,000 men made it the largest battle ever on North American soil
 Women in the War (women's various roles);
 Navy (focuses on maritime engagements);
 Campaigns and Battles of 1864–1865 (the last years of the Civil War);
 Battle Map, 1863–1865 (from Stones River to Appomattox);

A video We the People focuses on ten characters from all walks of life and their fates before, during, and after the war. It is presented in segments in galleries 1, 4, 9, 14 and concludes in the theater.

The Travancore sisters learned dancing under Guru Gopinath and Guru T. K. Mahalingam Pillai. Ragini died from cancer in 1976 and Lalitha in 1982. Padmini died in 2006. Few documents relating to them survived except for dozens of films and articles in Indian newspapers. The Travancore Sisters grew up in a joint family tharavadu 'Malaya Cottage' in Poojappura, Thiruvananthapuram. The Travancore sisters were nieces of the famous beauty Narayani Pillai Kunjamma, who spurned the king of Travancore in favour of marrying the aristocratic landowner Kesava Pillai of Kandamath and through her related to the actress Sukumari's mother Sathyabhama Amma and the Travancore Royal Family through cousin, Ambika. They came to be known as the Travancore sisters.
Uday Shankar called the sisters to Chennai (then Madras) to act in a film based on dance which he was planning to make . Padmini and her sisters were disciples of the noted Indian dancer Guru Gopinath .

The matriarchial head of the family was Karthyayini Amma whose husband was Palakunnathu Krishna Pillai of Cherthala alias 'Penang Padmanabha Pillai' or P K Pillai, who had  had six sons of whom Satyapalan Nair (Baby) was a leading producer of many early Malayalam films. Another son, Raveendran Nair's daughter Latika Suresh, is a leading producer of Malayalam TV programs. They performed at the 1955 Filmfare Awards.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Bears–Giants rivalry"", the article should at least have 250 words","The Bears–Giants rivalry is a National Football League (NFL) rivalry between the Chicago Bears and the New York Giants. The rivalry was notable for the six NFL championship games between the two teams prior to the creation of the Super Bowl, and the two subsequent Super Bowl-era playoff meetings that involved two of the NFL's greatest defensive units: the Bears' 46 defense crew helmed by Buddy Ryan, and the Giants' Big Blue Wrecking Crew mentored by Bill Belichick.

History

Pre-Super Bowl era
The Bears and Giants met in six NFL championship games, more than any common matchup in either the NFL Championship or Super Bowl. Between 1933 and 1946, the Bears and/or the Giants appeared in 12 of 14 NFL championship games, and combined to win seven championships in that span. Their first meeting came in the first-ever NFL Championship Game that concluded the 1933 season. In a close-knit affair, the Bears won the game and the championship 23–21 by scoring the game-winning touchdown in the final two minutes of the fourth quarter. It was Chicago's second consecutive championship, having previously won in 1932 when the league awarded the title to the team with the best regular season winning percentage. However, the Giants returned the favor in the 1934 NFL Championship Game, winning 30–13 by outscoring the Bears 27–0 in the fourth quarter. The game was forever immortalized as the Sneakers Game, as the Giants switched to basketball sneakers at the half due to the slick frozen conditions that affected the Polo Grounds field. 

The Bears and Giants met for a third time in the 1941 NFL Championship Game. This game was notable as it happened two weeks following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor; as a result, only 13,341 fans attended the game at Wrigley Field, the lowest of any NFL championship game. The Bears dominated the Giants 37–9 to win their fifth NFL title, thanks to four unanswered touchdowns in the second half. A fourth meeting took place in the 1946 NFL Championship Game, in which a then-record 58,346 fans witnessed the Bears defeat the Giants 24–14 in New York. The game was tied 14–14 after three quarters before the Bears scored ten unanswered points. The victory was marred, however, by a bribery scandal involving two Giants players.

In the 1956 NFL Championship Game, the Giants routed the Bears 47–7 at Yankee Stadium to win the championship. It was the team's last title until Super Bowl XXI in 1986. Similar to the 1934 title game, the Giants wore sneakers in order to gain traction on an icy field.  Seven years later, the Giants and Bears met for a sixth time to decide the 1963 NFL Championship. In a low-scoring affair, the Bears prevailed 14–10 to win their eighth NFL championship, their last until Super Bowl XX in 1985. It was also the final meeting between the Bears and Giants that decided the NFL championship.

Super Bowl era
The two teams underwent lengthy rebuilding periods following the 1963 title game, but in the 1980s, the Bears and Giants reemerged into title contention, thanks to two of the greatest defensive units in NFL history. Chicago's 46 defense, coached by Mike Ditka and defensive coordinator Buddy Ryan, featured Hall of Fame linebacker Mike Singletary, and defensive ends Richard Dent and Dan Hampton. New York's Big Blue Wrecking Crew, on the other hand, were coached by Bill Parcells and defensive coordinator Bill Belichick, and featured Hall of Fame linebackers Lawrence Taylor, Carl Banks and Harry Carson. The two teams first squared off in the 1985 NFC Divisional Round, in which Chicago's defensive crew outplayed their Giant counterparts in a 21–0 shutout. The tone of the game was set when a punt attempt by Giants punter Sean Landeta was muffed in the strong winds and Shaun Gayle returned it five yards for a touchdown. The Bears went on to win the Super Bowl that season. A rematch then took place in the 1990 NFC Divisional Round, which also ended in a blowout. This time, however, the Giants dominated Chicago in a 31–3 rout, and went on to win Super Bowl XXV. To date, this was the most recent meeting in the playoffs between the Bears and the Giants.

Recent years
After the 1990 playoff meeting, the rivalry cooled off a bit, though games between the two teams remained highly competitive. However, there were some notable moments that took place since then. During Week 10 of the 2006 season, Bears returner Devin Hester returned a missed field goal a then-record 108 yards for a touchdown, culminating in the Bears' 38–20 victory. The win proved crucial for the Bears as they went on to finish with the NFC's best record at 13–3, en route to a Super Bowl XLI appearance. The Giants, on the other hand, turned a 6–2 start into a 2–6 finish, ending with an 8–8 record and losing in the Wild Card Round to the rival Philadelphia Eagles. Then in Week 4 of the 2010 season, the Giants defense sacked Bears quarterback Jay Cutler nine times in the first half en route to a 17–3 victory, dealing Chicago its first loss of the season.

National Football League rivalries
Chicago Bears
New York Giants"," Bears–Giants rivalry The Bears–Giants rivalry is a National Football League (NFL) rivalry between the Chicago Bears and the New York Giants. The two teams have played each other since 1925, and the rivalry has been characterized by some of the most intense games in NFL history. The rivalry is also known for the prevalence of defensive struggles, as well as last-minute victories by one or both of the teams. The two teams have met each other twice in the NFL's championship game, with the Bears winning in 1941 and the Giants winning in 2007. The 2007 game, known as the ""Miracle at the Meadowlands"", featured one of the most dramatic finishes in NFL history, as the Giants won on a last-minute upset against the heavily favored Bears. The two teams have also had several notable regular-season games, including a Thanksgiving Day game in 1985 that ended in a 10–10 tie, and a game in 2011 that was won by the Bears in overtime. The Bears and the Giants have both won the NFL's Most Valuable Player Award, with the Bears' George Halas winning in 1946 and the Giants' Lawrence Taylor winning in 1986. The two teams have also had several notable players, including Halas, Taylor, Walter Payton, and Mike Ditka for the Bears, and Y. A.

Welch (November 27, 1889 – November 10, 1959) was an American businessman, best known as the founder of the Welch's grape juice company. Welch was born in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Frederick Welch and Helen LouiseProtchett. His father, a successful lawyer, died in 1898, leaving the family in straitened circumstances. Welch attended public schools in Brooklyn, and graduated from high school in 1908. He worked as a messenger for a bank, but was laid off in 1909 due to recession. He was able to secure a position with a wholesale drug company, Johnson & Johnson, where he learned the bottle manufacturing business. In 1911, he founded his own business, the Welch Bottle Company, to manufacture and sell glass bottles to the wine and champagne industries. The company grew to become the largest manufacturer of champagne bottles in the United States. In the early 1920s, Welch's business encountered financial difficulties, and he was forced to declare bankruptcy. As a result, he sold his company to the Crown Cork & Seal Company for $1.5 million. He then began to look for other business opportunities, and soon focused his attention on the emerging market for grape juice. In 1924, he founded the Welch Fruit Company, which initially sold grape juice under the name ""Welch's Vinic"", and soon afterwards began selling a non-alcoholic champagne called ""Methuen champagne"". The company grew rapidly, and in 1928 it was renamed the Welch's Grape Juice Company. Welch was an active philanthropist, and served as a trustee of the John Hopkins University and the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. In 1952, he established the Robert S. Welch Foundation, which provides funding for medical research and education. He was also a patron of the arts, and helped to establish the Cleveland Symphony Orchestra. Welch died of a heart attack in 1959, at the age of seventy.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""2013 Rayong oil spill"", the article should at least have 250 words","The Rayong oil spill occurred on July 27, 2013, in the Gulf of Thailand, off the coast of Ko Samet and Map Ta Phut in Rayong Province.

Event 
On July 27, 2013, a pipeline owned by PTTGC Plc, a Thai state-owned oil company, burst while oil was being transferred from an undersea well to a tanker. PTTGC then followed the operation procedures for oil spill management. The Company used boats and airplanes to spray oil-spill dispersants, 0,612 litres of Slickgone NS and 6,930 litres of Super-Dispersant 25, which are permitted by the Department of Pollution Control to be used in Thailand, because they have low toxicity, are biodegradable and do not bio-accumulate or cause mutation and degeneration. It released also a boom to contain the spilled oil within the area. However, the boom did not work well due to bad weather.

On the night of 28 July 2013, the oil leak (from a pipeline)  from the beach at Ko Samet's Coconut Bay (Ao Phrao) resulted in the beach being closed and its tourists evacuated, after spillage reached the beach. On 4 August 2013 media said that the crude oil spill had occurred  off of Thailand's mainland, ""when a floating hose transferring oil from a tanker to a PTT refinery pipeline broke sending, PTT says,  of oil spewing into the coastal waters"". Two beaches have been closed due to uncertainty about water toxicity. Ko Samet is a popular tourist island, not far from Bangkok,  off the coast of Ban Phe', Rayong. Concerns have been growing about the oil spill and the inconsistent information released.

Ko Samet is close to Rayong and Map Ta Phut, and they have had a long history of environmental problems since they opened in 1990. About 25,000 people live in the Map Ta Phut municipality. In 1997, the pollution came to public attention when 1,000 pupils and teachers at a local school suffered from illnesses after inhaling toxic emissions and had to be hospitalized. An independent test carried out in 2005 demonstrated that airborne cancerous toxic chemicals released by Map Ta Phut Industrial Estate exceeded safety standards of developed nations by 60 to 3,000 times.

The oil spill is in part connected to the oil operations at Map Ta Phut. Anthony Zola, an American environmental consultant is reported to have said ""In rural areas, there is almost no enforcement at all. Water pollution, air pollution, noise pollution—you can make all the complaints you want, and no one pays any attention to you."" Map Ta Phut was closed down in 2009 by the previous Prime Minister, Abhisit Vejjaijiva due to safety concerns. The New York Times reported ""Even among critics of the court decisions, there is widespread agreement that Map Ta Phut is heavily polluted and unhealthy for those who live nearby. But environmental experts remain skeptical that the court decisions will fix the problem.""

Two days after the oil spill was discovered, PTT closed their War Room down according to Bangkok Post, and they have consistently since then tried to play down the effects of the spill. A week later they were saying it was safe to go to the beach and that it was clean. Greenpeace is concerned with the use of dispersants and the oil has sunk to the bottom and the full effects of the spill have yet to be understood. Mercury levels have also been reported to be 21 times safe limits. The dispersants also have negative effects and can cause cancers, kidney and liver problems. Some people swimming in the sea have reported dizziness. Bangkok Post reported ""In 2012, a study found that Corexit increases the toxicity of oil by 52 times. It can remain in the ecological food chain for many years and cause widespread and long-lasting health impacts.""

Estimates 
Official reports said  of oil were spilled, but critics of the oil company and the government say that the spill was much larger and warned of health risks posed both by the spill and by the chemicals being used to disperse the oil.

A higher estimate of the oil spill has been performed by Somporn Chuai-aree of Prince Songkhla University: ""as low as  or as high as "". This estimate is believed by associate professor Siwat Pongniumchan from the National Institute of Development Administration (Nida), who disbelieves previous estimates.

Effects 
Tourism operators and officials were concerned about the effects on tourism in the area, as beaches in Rayong and on the nearby resort island of Ko Samet were impacted.

A 14 August 2013 Bangkok Post article said that ""Fishery Department director-general Wimol Jantrarotai said Chulalongkorn University lab tests on seafood found metal contamination in samples from fish markets near Koh Samet.""

The oil company's information sheet given to media (on the beach) on 31 July, said that the oil dispersant used is ""Slickgone NS"".

On 30 July 2013 Bangkok Post said that ""authorities and more than 500 PTT employees have been struggling to prevent the slick spreading at the beach. They have tried to contain the spill, which has stretched almost  along the bay, using containment booms to prevent further environmental damage in the area.""

A 14 August 2013 Bangkok Post article said that ""mercury levels found in sea water off Ao Phrao beach on Koh Samet were 29 times higher than safety standards allow, according to the Pollution Control Department. Furthermore ""Niphon Phungsuwan, a marine expert from the Department of Marine and Coastal Resources, said more than 70% of coral at Ao Phrao had been bleached.""

Bangkok Post reports ""PTTGC has remained silent about what chemicals it is using but also said they could pose a hazard to the environment and people's health."" In 2012, a study found that Corexit increases the toxicity of oil by 52 times. It can remain in the ecological food chain for many years and cause widespread and long-lasting health impacts. ""The use of dispersants is a solution that creates new and worse problems,"" Ms Arpa said. The main ingredients of Corexit include 2-Butoxyethanol which can comprise up to 60% of the dispersant and is known to harm the blood, kidneys, liver and central nervous system. Some people swimming near Ko Samet have reported dizziness, and two beaches have been closed. Swimming is not recommended until more is known and the full environmental impacts have been independently verified. As of 20 August 2013, tourists are recommended to use caution if and when going swimming in the water, and to be careful of seafood for now. They should report dizziness of feeling unwell to the relevant authorities or to their embassy.

On 31 August 2013 Bangkok Post said that the level of total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) ""still exceeds safety standards"".

Insurance
On 30 July 2013 Bangkok Post said that ""The company PTTGC has insurance coverage of US$50 million with Dhipaya Insurance.""

The oil spread along the coast of Rayong Province, and affected the beaches of Rayong, Pattaya, and Sattahip. The spill also affected the area's marine and fishing industries. The pipeline is owned by the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC), and the oil was destined for the Laem Chabang Port, the principal port for Bangkok. The pipeline was inspected in 2012, and was found to be in good condition. The cause of the spill is under investigation, but the damage is estimated to be US$62 million. The oil spill affected over 100 kilometres (62 mi) of coastline, with the oil spreading over the water and onto the beaches. The spill was most severe on the beaches of Rayong, where the oil had reached a depth of 2 kilometres (1.2 mi). On 25 June 2013, the Thai government declared the oil spill to be a disaster, and announced that the KPC would be required to provide THB1.6 billion (US$50 million) in compensation. The Thai government also requested that the KPC provide a further THB1.6 billion for environmental and marine rehabilitation. The KPC has accepted responsibility for the spill, and has pledged to clean up the spill, and to provide assistance to the affected areas. The company has also agreed to pay THB2 billion (US$60 million) in compensation to the Thai government.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,40135754,0.08607594936708862,0.09473684210526316,0.2440561292030712,0.1542056074766355,4,6,1,0,4,1,0,0,0,1,0.1488473265345565,0.025532330825121238,0.004418668876001105,0.020884520884520884,3,0,7,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,15,1,20,1,1,1

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Business casual"", the article should at least have 250 words","Business casual is an ambiguously defined Western dress code that is generally considered casual wear but with smart (in the sense of ""well dressed"") components of a proper lounge suit from traditional informal wear, adopted for  white-collar workplaces. This interpretation typically including dress shirt, necktie, and trousers, but worn with an odd-coloured blazer or a sports coat instead.

Acceptance of business casual in the United States was preceded by Casual Fridays which originated in California in the 1990s, in turn inspired by the Hawaiian 1960s casual custom of Aloha Friday. The designation of particular clothing pieces as ""business casual"" may be contentious.

Definition
There is no generally agreed definition of ""business casual"".  One definition of business casual states that it includes khaki pants, slacks, and skirts, as well as short-sleeved polo shirts  and long-sleeved shirts, but excludes jeans, tight or short skirts, T-shirts, and sweatshirts. Another source, an American university careers service, states that business casual consists of neutral colors more towards the dark shades of black, gray, navy, but can include white and off white, and reminds that the clothing should be pressed and have clean, crisp seams. The ""Dress for Success"" advice from the University of Toronto sums up business casual as ""a classic, clean cut, and put together look where a full suit is not required,"" which means slacks, khakis, or skirts; blouses, polo shirts, or shirts with collar but no necktie; some sweaters; and closed-toe shoes. The Canadian university ends with the warning that ""it is not clothing you would wear to a club or for athletic purposes.... Don’t let the word casual mislead you. You still need to look professional.""

Another author wrote in the Financial Times that ""Ordinarily business casual for guys seems fairly clear. It is a pair of chinos, a blazer and a good shirt, no tie."" 

A writer wrote in a workwear Blog that ""Business casual attire for also men consists of dress pants, dockers-type pants, khakis and a shirt. They also wear a golf-type shirt instead of a traditional shirt, and they wear sweaters or vests on top of the shirt. Women’s choose to wear pants or skirts with a top or blouses paired with a sweater.""

A BBC article suggested that a ""safe global standard"" consists of ""a button down shirt,"" ""jackets or blazers, khaki or gray slacks, and leather shoes."" It warned, however, that great variation exists between countries and regions within countries. A U.S. menswear retailer advises men to wear a collared shirt, chinos, navy blazer, and brown shoes, while making sure to look ""clean and well-groomed.""

A contributor to Forbes asked her Facebook friends to define business casual, and found a slightly more casual apparent consensus not forcibly including a jacket: ""For men: trousers/khakis and a shirt with a collar. For women: trousers/knee-length skirt and a blouse or shirt with a collar. No jeans. No athletic wear."" A response to that was ""I disagree. No khakis."" She states that ""there’s a lack of consensus in what actually defines a business casual wardrobe. All most people know is they don’t want to see too much of a colleague’s body, including feet.""

Casual wear"," Business casual Business casual is an attire style typically worn for office work. It is usually more casual than formal wear, but not as casual as leisure wear. Business casual dress is typically worn in offices in Western countries, and in the West, it is generally considered to be the expected clothing for a business meeting. Business casual dress generally includes a jacket and trousers for men, and a dress or blouse with a skirt or trousers for women. Business casual footwear includes dress shoes, oxford shoes, and loafers. With the exception of footwear, business casual attire is typically worn without socks, although it is not uncommon to see men wearing socks with their business casual attire. When dressing for business casual, darker colors (black, navy, and grey) and conservative styles are usually the best options. Although business casual is typically more relaxed than formal attire, it is not usually the best look to wear very bright colors or trendy styles. Business casual attire is often more comfortable than formal attire, so people can usually be more productive if they are not worried about their clothing being too tight or uncomfortable. Business casual attire is typically not as expensive as formal attire, so people can usually afford to buy more of it, and it can be more cost-effective for companies to provide business casual attire for their employees.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,536963,0.08745684695051782,0.07368421052631578,0.205526271451609,0.10903426791277258,1,5,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0.25324921848521376,0.02440421357705956,0.002623584645125656,0.01597051597051597,8,0,6,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,0,6,0,1,1
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Reinberg"", the article should at least have 250 words","Reinberg is a village and in the municipality of Sundhagen and lies between Stralsund and Greifswald on the B 105 federal road in northeastern Germany. To the north the former municipality of Reinberg borders on the Strelasund From the village of Stahlbrode that used to belong to it, there is a car ferry to the island of Rügen (Zudar peninsula).

History 
In 1220 construction began on the church and in 1325 Reinberg was mentioned for the first time in the records.

On the dissolution of the Principality of Rügen in 1325, the village transferred to the Duchy of Pomerania.

From the end of the Thirty Years' War to the year 1815 the region belonged to Swedish Pomerania and thereafter to the Prussian Province of Pomerania.

Until 1952 Reinberg was part of the district of Grimmen within the Bezirk of Rostock to 1994. Since 1990 it has also bee part of the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.

On 7 June 2009 the hitherto independent municipality of Reinsberg merged with those of Behnkendorf, Brandshagen, Horst, Kirchdorf, Miltzow and Wilmshagen to form the new municipality of Sundhagen. The former municipality consists of the villages of Oberhinrichshagen, Falkenhagen, Dömitzow and Stahlbrode.

Sights 
Amongst the sights of Reinberg are its Gothic village church, the Sühnestein monument on the cemetery wall that dates to the 15th century and the Reinberg Lime, which was the largest tree in Germany in the 19th century. The age of the tree is around 1,000 years. It is possible that the lime had been planted before the foundation and consecration of the church. Near the tree is the grave of the father of surgeons, Theodor Billroth.

The Sühnestein (""Atonement Stone"") has a kneeling figure with hands clasped, next to Christ on the cross. Above the cross, between two roses, are the initials ""J.N.R.J."" and the words: ""domini miserere mei"". The weathered inscription above the crucified Jesus probably originally ran: ""orate pro ravno van barneko"". It may also be read as ""orate pro heyno van der beken"", however there is no record of a van der Beken family. The princely councillor and  Landvogt, Raven Barnekow, however, was sentenced to death and executed in Stralsund in 1453 as a result of false allegations. This suggests this expiatory cross (Sühnekreuz) was erected in his memory.

Former municipalities in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania
Vorpommern-Rügen
Bezirk Rostock"," Reinberg Reinberg (German: Reinberg) is a municipality in the Uecker-Schlemmer-Plettenberg region of the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia. It lies in the eastern North Rhine-Westphalia on the border with Poland, about 25 km (16 mi) east of Greifswald. It has a population of about 4,000. The municipality includes the villages of Borck, Brüssow, Neuenhagen, Reinkau, Ribbeck, and Wesenberg. Reinberg was mentioned for the first time in a document from 1283. The name Reinberg is derived from the word Rheim, which means ""Rhine"" in Low German, and the word Berg, which means ""mountain"" or ""hill"" in German. In the 14th and 15th centuries, the area of present-day Reinberg was the scene of border conflicts between the duchies of Pomerania and Brandenburg. The border between the two duchies ran through the present-day municipality, along the Uecker river and through the villages of Wesenberg and Neuenhagen. In 1398, the SchutzEnders (traders and craftsmen) of Stettin (now part of Szczecin in Poland) had to pay duties to the dukes of Pomerania for all goods that they transported along the ""old road"" from Stettin to Uecker. The ""old road"" was the trail that led from Neuenhagen, through the present-day municipality, to the Uecker ferry at Niesky (now part of Ueckerhamberg). In 1454, the landlord of Neuenhagen, Wenzel von Borck, was granted several privileges by the Brandenburg duke Frederick II (""the Iron""), among them the right to hold a market. At the same time, the Neuenhagen parish church was built, which still exists today. In 1485, the Uecker bridge at Niesky was completed. It connected the road from Berlin to Stettin with the ""old road"" from Stettin to Uecker. In 1551, the Brandenburger Duke John Sigismund granted the Schulthei (a kind of sheriff) of Neuenhagen the right to collect duties at the Uecker bridge. In 1602, the Neutre Kôte (the "" Neutral Quay"" in French), a small island in the Uecker river near Neuenhagen, was incorporated into Neuenhagen. In 1634, the surrounding area became the scene of the Thirty Years' War. Neuenhagen was completely destroyed by a Swedish army under the command of General Torsten Cronberg in 1636. In 1701, the Schulthei of Neuenhagen was granted the right to hold a second market each year. On 7 June 1707, the Neuenhagen parish church was completely destroyed by a lightning strike. It was rebuilt between 1708 and 1712 to a design by the Berlin architect Johann Friedrich Huth. The church was again destroyed in 1716, this time by a fire caused by a lightning strike. It was rebuilt between 1717 and 1719. The tower was not rebuilt, which is why the church has a flat roof to this day. In 1747, the landlord of Neuenhagen, the Tyrolean noble and prince bishop Franz Carl von Paula von Reinberg, after whom the municipality is named, acquired the estate of Neuenhagen. He had the previous mansion house, a brick building with a thatched roof, torn down and a new one built in Baroque style. This building, the so-called Neuenhagen Castle, is still in existence. In 1756, Neuenhagen was granted a license to have an inn. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the region of present-day Reinberg was the scene of the ""Crown-Wars of Sweden and Russia"". The Uecker river was the border between the two powers. In 1788, the first bridge across the Uecker river was built at Niesky. In 1818, the landlord of Neuenhagen, Prince Francis of Reinberg, had the Neuenhagen Castle converted into a pharmacy and a residence for the pharmacist. The castle has had several owners since then. In 1978, the last private owner, Paul Meding, sold the castle to the municipality of Reinberg. Since 1991, the castle has been the seat of the Reinberg branch of the Bodelschwingh Foundation, a charitable organization with a focus on social work, education, and health. On 17 January 1998, the municipality of Reinberg was formed by merging the municipalities of Wesenberg, Neuenhagen,",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,13203734,0.06075949367088609,0.3473684210526316,0.15615567911040507,0.7725856697819314,2,2,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0.15926374414343292,0.026743948460107067,0.002623584645125656,0.022113022113022112,4,3,2,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,1,10,1,1,1

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Lunar-A"", the article should at least have 250 words","LUNAR-A is a cancelled Japanese spacecraft project that was originally scheduled to be launched in August 2004.  After many delays (primarily due to potential thruster faults), the project was eventually cancelled in January 2007. It was planned to be launched on a Japanese M-V rocket from the Kagoshima Space Center.

History
The vehicle would have been cylindrical, with a diameter of 2.2 m and a height of 1.7 m. It would have had four solar panels and was engineered to be spin-stabilized. Plans called for it to enter an elliptical orbit around the Moon, and deploy two penetrators at an altitude of 40 km on opposite sides of the lunar body. The penetrators were to have been braked by a small rocket at an altitude of 25 km, then free fall to the surface. They were designed to withstand a collision speed of 330 meters per second to deeply penetrate the lunar regolith.

Once the penetrators deployed, the LUNAR-A spacecraft was mission-planned to maneuver to an orbital altitude of 200 km above the lunar surface. The craft was to have carried a monochromatic imaging camera with a resolution of 30 m.

Japanese Lunar Exploration Program"," Lunar-A was the first mission in the JAXA's (Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency) Luna-series, and was part of the Japanese Moon exploration program. The primary objective of the mission was to conduct a scientific investigation of the Moon's far side, including a limited survey of the lunar surface and a study of the lunar environment. The Japanese spacecraft was launched on 19 October 2014, at 20:12 JST (05:12 UTC) from Tanegashima Space Center by a M-V rocket, and arrived at the Moon on 3 April 2015. After a year of scientific operations, the spacecraft was crashed into the Moon's surface on 31 October 2015. The mission made Japan the fourth country to achieve a soft landing on the Moon, and the first to do so since the Soviet Union's Luna 24 in 1976. Lunar-A was the first of two missions in the Luna-series, the second being the currently ongoing Luna-C. Luna-A was developed by JAXA, and was a successor to the cancelled Selene lunar probe, which was developed by the same agency. Like Selene, Luna-A was a semi-permanent satellite, and was designed to conduct a comprehensive study of the lunar surface, including the composition and structure of the regolith, the lunar atmosphere, and the origin and evolution of the Moon. Luna-A carried a variety of scientific instruments, including a stereo camera, a spectrometer, and a radar sounder. The spacecraft was also equipped with a small lander, which was designed to conduct a detailed study of the lunar surface. The lander was equipped with a variety of instruments, including a camera, a spectrometer, and a soil analyzer. The lander was designed to survive for one lunar day, or about two Earth years. After the lander's mission was complete, the spacecraft was to return to Earth, and was to be used for future lunar missions. The mission was a great success, and the spacecraft returned a wealth of data on the lunar surface, including the first high-resolution images of the far side of the Moon. The spacecraft was also able to detect a variety of minerals on the lunar surface, including iron, magnesium, and titanium. The lander made a successful landing on the Moon, and was able to conduct a variety of experiments on the lunar surface. The lander was also able to return a variety of samples to Earth, which were to be used in future research.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,1746012,0.04339963833634718,0.1368421052631579,0.1358220810166799,0.3691588785046729,1,4,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0.06674574094771363,0.023032971214710922,0.003728251864125932,0.022113022113022112,1,0,0,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3,1,6,1,1,1
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Fakhra Younus"", the article should at least have 250 words","Fakhra Younus (; 1979 – 17 March 2012) was a Pakistani woman who was the victim of an acid attack, which severely injured her face. She underwent 39 surgeries during a 10-year period. She died by suicide at age 33.

Biography

Younus was a dancer in a red-light district in Pakistan,  when she met her future husband, Bilal Khar, the son of Ghulam Mustafa Khar, who himself is a former Governor and Chief Minister of Pakistan's largest province, Punjab. They were married for three years, with Younus eventually leaving him after she claimed he physically and verbally abused her. She further claimed that he later visited her in May 2000 and poured acid on her, in the presence of her 5-year-old son from a different man.

Khar claimed that the attacker was someone else with his name. He was acquitted of all charges in the incident. Younus was sent to Rome, Italy, for treatment by Tehmina Durrani, Khar's stepmother. Initially she was denied a visa, but under public pressure, she was allowed to leave for Italy. Durrani engaged the Italian cosmetic firm Saint Angelic and Italian government to treat her. Smile Again, an Italian NGO head by Clarice Felli entered Pakistan to assist in the care of mutilated women.

Younus committed suicide by jumping from the sixth floor of a building in  Rome, Italy. Her body was brought back to Pakistan by Durrani, and was wrapped in an Italian and Pakistani flag. The funeral prayer of Younus was held at Edhi home in Kharadar. She is buried at Karachi, Pakistan, in the Defence area.

Legacy

Her attack, trial, and suicide received international attention, and highlighted the plight of acid attacks victims in Pakistan. There were 1,375 acid attacks in the country between 2007 and 2016; or some 153 per year; however only 56% are actually female victims or 85 per year. She was featured in the critically acclaimed documentary film, Saving Face (2012), having been awarded the nation's first Oscar less than a month prior to her suicide. As a result of the awareness she helped raise, acid attacks have continuously fallen.

""In 2016 and 2017, there were a total of 71 victims of acid attacks, whereas between 2018 and 2019, there were 62 cases related to acid throwing"". Additionally protections have been brought in for women including the very latest Acid and Burn Crime Bill (2017), which ""offers free medical treatment and rehabilitation for acid burn victims, who often face lifelong physical and psychological disabilities"". The film Younus participated in directly helped in such legislation being brought forward and passed by the parliament.

Pakistani sex workers"," Fakhra Younus (Urdu: فخرا یونس) (born 26 July 1979) is a Pakistani woman who was badly burned in a fire following an acid attack on her in 2002. She was the first acid attack victim to file a criminal case in Pakistan and the first to do so successfully. Born in 1979 in Lahore, Pakistan, Younus was a student of Psychology at the Government College University, Lahore. On 24 June 2002, she was attacked with acid by her ex-husband, Abdul Hafeez, who was upset that she had left him. He had asked her to leave the house after Younus had accused him of harassment. The attack left her with severe burns on her face and body. After the attack, Younus was admitted to the burns ward of the Mayo Hospital in Lahore, where she received treatment for four months. Her family was unable to afford the cost of treatment, and the hospital did not have the facilities to treat such severe burns. She was then referred to the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, a charity hospital in Lahore, where she received treatment for free. In 2002, Younus filed a criminal case against her ex-husband in the court of law, becoming the first acid attack victim to do so in Pakistan. In the same year, she also filed a civil case against her attacker. Her ex-husband was convicted and sentenced to life in prison by the court. Younus was awarded compensation of Pakistan Rupee 500,000 (approximately US$5,000) by the court, as well as the costs of her medical treatment. She used the money to establish a rehabilitation centre for acid attack victims in Lahore. In 2006, Younus was given the Kennedy Center for International Delegations Award for her efforts in helping other acid attack victims in Pakistan. In 2009, she received the Martin Luther King Non-Violent Peace Prize. In 2010, she married a civil engineer, Muhammad Fayyaz, and the couple has two sons. In 2015, she was appointed as the first female honorary consul general of Poland in Lahore. In 2015, the Government of Pakistan awarded her with the Sitara-i-Imtiaz, the third highest civilian honour and decoration of the country, for her efforts in helping acid attack victims in Pakistan.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,35256534,0.07825086306098965,0.16842105263157894,0.17163694129540039,0.3333333333333333,3,3,1,0,3,1,1,1,0,0,0.1745855841781801,0.019356153186415335,0.003452085059375863,0.014742014742014743,7,0,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,6,1,10,1,1,1

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""MN1 (gene)"", the article should at least have 250 words","MN1 is a gene found on human chromosome 22, with gene map locus 22q12.3-qter.  Its official full name is meningioma (disrupted in balanced translocation) 1 because it is disrupted by a balanced translocation (4;22) in a meningioma.

Function 
MN1 is a transcription coregulator that enhances or represses gene expression through direct or indirect interaction with the gene regulatory machinery. Reported interactions include the BAF (SWI/SNF) complex. RAC3 and p300.  MN1 can act as a coactivator of several transcription factors, including RAR/RXR and the vitamin D receptor. In AML, MN1 binds to genomic sites enriched for binding motifs of ETS factors as well as hematopoietic transcription factors such as RUNX1, GATA2, HOXA cluster genes, and MEIS1. MN1 induces a hematopoietic stem and progenitor gene expression program centered on HOXA cluster genes, particularly HOXA9 and MEIS1 via its interaction with the BAF complex

Clinical significance 

The translocation of MN1 was first reported in meningioma. A substantial percentage of primitive neuro-ectodermal tumors (PNET)  have MN1 translocations Several different partners were described, although in many cases no fusion partner was identified. MN1 transloations also occur in up to 2% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) Described fusion partners include ETV6, STAT3 and FLI1. About 50% of fusions are out of frame and result in high expression of MN1 via enhancer hijacking.
High MN1 expression in AML and MDS is associated with poor outcome 

Mutations in this gene have been associated with cleft palate and an atypical form of rhombencephalosynapsis.

Transcription coregulators"," MN1 (gene) The MN1 gene (mobile element derived 1 gene) is a gene that codes for the protein Meis1. The gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 20 (20p11.2). It spans 3.3 kb and comprises 3 exons and 2 introns. The MN1 gene encodes a protein called Meis1, a DNA-binding protein that is a transcription factor and regulator of cell differentiation and growth control. The gene is expressed in all tissues, with higher levels in testis and lower levels in kidney. The MN1 gene is evolutionarily conserved, with homologs in both vertebrates and invertebrates. In humans, the gene has 4 alternatively spliced variants, 3 of which encode the same protein and 1 that is a pseudogene. The MN1 gene is involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. It is a transcription factor that binds to the DNA and regulates the expression of target genes. The gene is involved in the regulation of cell cycle, cell growth, and cell differentiation. The MN1 gene is associated with the development of several cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, and acute lymphocytic leukemia. The gene is also associated with the development of Wilms' tumor, a type of kidney cancer.

The band currently consists of Steve Balsamo (vocals, guitar), Andy Collins (vocals, bass), Rob Thompson (vocals, guitar), Brian Thomas (drums, percussion), and Alan Thomas (keys, mandolin, banjo) and formerly included Dai Smith, who sang and played guitar until August 2008, when he left. He was replaced by Rosalie Deighton.

Conception (2003–2006)
The group featured four singer-songwriters all taking lead vocals on different songs. They count as inspirations such vocal harmony-based bands as Fleetwood Mac, The Eagles, Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young and The Beatles. 

They recorded their eponymous debut album The Storys in an old converted cinema in the Welsh Valleys and released the album themselves, setting up their own label – Hall Recordings – before signing a record deal with Warners and having their album re-released on Korova in March 2006.

Their first gig was to over 70,000 people at The Olympic Torch Concert outside Buckingham Palace, and was followed by a support slot with Tom Jones and a series of gigs in venues such as Bush Hall and The Borderline. The band also supported Elton John on two European tours.

2006–early 2008
Town Beyond The Trees, the band's second album, was released in 2008 on the band's own label, Hall Recordings, after Korova folded in 2007. It was recorded in Spring 2007 at Peter Gabriel's Real World studios near Bath, UK. The album was produced by Jon Kelly (Beautiful South, Kate Bush, Deacon Blue, Paul McCartney). It received favourable reviews from such publications as Maverick Magazine, Uncut Magazine, Classic Rock Magazine, Rock 'n' Reel Magazine etc. 

The band have also supported Santana (Switzerland), Celine Dion (Holland), Sinéad O'Connor (Belgium), Elton John (UK), Runrig (Germany) and Van Morrison (UK) as well as touring the UK in their own right.

Early 2008–2010
Dai Smith left the band in 2008 and was subsequently replaced by folk singer/songwriter, Rosalie Deighton.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Exile of Ovid"", the article should at least have 250 words","Ovid, the Latin poet of the Roman Empire, was banished in 8 AD from Rome to Tomis (now Constanţa, Romania) by decree of the emperor Augustus. The reasons for his banishment are uncertain. Ovid's exile is related by the poet himself, and also in brief references to the event by Pliny the Elder and Statius. At the time, Tomis was a remote town on the edge of the civilized world; it was loosely under the authority of the Kingdom of Thrace (a satellite state of Rome), and was superficially Hellenized. According to Ovid, none of its citizens spoke Latin, which as an educated Roman, he found trying. Ovid wrote that the cause of his exile was carmen et error: ""a poem and an error,"" probably the Ars Amatoria and a personal indiscretion or mistake. The council of the city of Rome revoked his exile in December 2017, some 2000 years after his banishment.

Ovid was one of the most prolific poets of his time, and before being banished had already composed his most famous poems – Heroides, Amores, Ars Amatoria, Remedia Amoris, Medicamina Faciei Femineae, his lost tragedy Medea, the ambitious Metamorphoses and the Fasti. The latter two works were left, respectively, without a final revision and only half finished. In exile, the poet continued producing works that survive today: Ibis, Tristia, Epistulae ex Ponto, and possibly several other, minor poems. These works consist of letters to friends and enemies, and also depict the poet's treatment by the Scythians – particularly the Getae, a nomadic people related to the Dacians or Thracians.

Ovid's poems in exile have been seen as of fundamental importance for the study of Roman aristocracy under Augustus and Tiberius, furnishing ""precious pieces of information about events and persons."" His work continued to serve as a literary influence on Latin writers who also experienced exile, from Seneca to Boethius. It was also a central point of reference for medieval imaginings of exile, as it was for Romantic portrayals of misunderstood genius. In modern times, classicists have questioned whether the exile was merely a farce, a misrepresentation by Ovid, or a rhetorical and literary device.

Background
At the age of 50, Ovid, the most famous poet of his time was banished from Rome to the remote town of Tomis on the Black Sea. This happened to Ovid in the year 8 AD by the exclusive intervention of the Emperor Augustus, without the participation of the Senate or of any Roman judge, and was the ruin of his ambitious hopes.

Ovid wrote later that the reason for his exile was carmen et error – ""a poem and a mistake,""  claiming that what he did was nothing illegal, but worse than murder, more harmful than poetry. The poems of his Tristia, however, are full of declarations that it was not a crime, just a mistake caused by stupidity, that it was done without premeditation, and that the mistake's nature was that Ovid has seen something. He repeatedly says that the emperor must realize that because he has only exiled the poet without putting him to death, confiscating his possessions, or depriving him of Roman citizenship.

Causes of the exile
The carmen to which Ovid referred has been identified as Ars Amatoria (The Art of Love), written some seven years before his exile,. However, Ovid expresses surprise that only he has been exiled for such a reason since many others also wrote obscene verse, seemingly with the emperor's approval. Scholars have argued that Ovid's real crime was ""lèse-majesté"". Augustus was presenting himself as the restorer of Roman public morality and could not fail to punish an author of such standing who represented himself in the Ars amatoria as a promoter of adultery in defiance of the Emperor.

Speculations about the nature of Ovid's ""mistake"" have differed over the centuries. They have included:

 sexual:
 Ovid had discovered that Augustus had committed incest with his own daughter, Julia the Elder, or with his granddaughter Julia the Younger;
 Ovid had engaged in adultery with these ladies himself or had been witness to their adultery with someone else.
 political:
 Ovid had frequented circles that politically opposed the emperor, such as that of Lucius Aemilius Paullus, who conspired with others to restore the right of imperial succession to Agrippa Postumus, grandson of Augustus.

In such a case, objection to Ars Amatoria was a mere pretext, concealing the real cause of Ovid's condemnation, considering the time that had elapsed between the publication of this work and the sentence of Augustus. To support this view, some authors note that the ""Art of Love"" was no more indecent than many publications by Propertius, Tibullus and Horace circulating freely at that time. Proponents also believe that foreseeing the consequences of the themes of his first poems, Ovid had already changed his artistic focus and written works with less sexual themes, such as Metamorphoses, with the deification of Julius Caesar and the glorification of Augustus, and the Fasti, which are dedicated to Roman festivals of his time.

Another political suggestion has been that Ovid was an intellectual objector against authoritarianism.

Falsehood thesis

Poetic fiction
A more recent thesis has been that Ovid's exile was not real. Early in the 20th century, J. J. Hartman argued that Ovid never left Rome for exile and that all of his works referring to it are imaginative and humorous fiction. This theory was debated during the 1930s, especially by certain Dutch authors. In 1951, a similar theory was proposed by O. Janssen.

In a 1985 article, A.D. Fitton Brown also argued that Ovid's exile was fictional. The reasons advanced by Brown are basically:
That, except for doubtful passages in Pliny the Elder and Statius, no other historian mentioned it until the beginning of the 5th century.
That Ovid's descriptions of Tomis were already available to him in Roman authors.
That the poet was already adept at projecting a persona separate from personal life.

Brown's hypothesis opened a debate over the accuracy of the ancient poets when dealing with historical facts. Roman poets themselves wrote about this gap between biography and invention. Modern authors suggest that Ovid's treatment of Augustus in Tristia, chiefly as a character and only secondarily as the addressee, are a reminder that these letters are literature first and foremost and that one cannot assume that they were intended to obtain an actual recall. Ovid seems rather to be inventing poetic fiction.

Fasti and Ibis
Orthodox scholars, however, are opposed to such hypotheses. One of their main arguments is that Ovid would not have let his Fasti remain unfinished since the poem was meant to seal his consecration as an imperial poet. Nevertheless, although this work gives the clearest testimony of support of Augustan ideals, it has also been commented that passage 3.371–80 of the Fasti is evidence of resistance to the Augustan succession.

Traditionally, it is argued that in the circumstances of being far from Rome, Ovid had no access to libraries and thus might have been forced to abandon his poem about the Roman calendar, of which only the first six books (January through June) exist. In addition both the Metamorphoses and Fasti seem to lack evidence of a final revision, as Ovid himself claims in the Tristia. Moreover, parts of these two poems may have been rewritten by him in Tomis, while Heroides 16–21 may have been entirely composed during his exile.

However, this hypothesis of a lack of scholarly documentation in Tomis does not seem able to stand when one considers the development of a poem so far-fetched as Ibis, with its encyclopedic cargo of Alexandrian  mythological knowledge. Other authors believe that the enemy in Ibis is not a real person. There is, in any case, another explanation for the abandonment of writing the Fasti. B. R. Nagle suggests the possibility that Ovid conceived the idea of writing this work as early as 8 BC when Augustus, the new Pontifex Maximus, corrected the defects resulting from the introduction of the Julian calendar. Nagle also argues that political motivations may have caused the poet to link the work with the year 4 AD, when Tiberius was adopted by Augustus and therefore implicitly named his successor. Ovid may then have lost his enthusiasm for the Julian dynasty and transferred his support to the lineage of Claudius, leaving unfinished the poem he was meditating.

Works
Ovid made banishment the subject of his last three major works of poetry: the Ibis, a ""venomous attack on an unnamed enemy"", and the two collections of literary epistles, Tristia and Epistulae ex Ponto.

The Ibis, an elegiac curse poem attacking an adversary at home, was written during the journey to his place of exile, although it has been argued that this work was ""literary rather than personal"". In fact, Callimachus had already written a poem with the same title attacking Apollonius of Rhodes. Caelius Rhodiginus (Antiq. Lect. xiii. 1) says, on the authority of Caecilius Minutianus Apuleius, that the enemy was Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus.

The five books of the elegiac Tristia are dated to 9–12 AD, during the first four years of Ovid's banishment. They are a series of poems expressing the poet's despair in exile and advocating his return to Rome. Its advocacy of his literary worth perhaps goes too far when compared to that of Augustus's favorite, Virgil, particularly with his magnum opus the Aeneid. The tenth elegy of the fourth book is valuable because it contains many particulars of Ovid's life.

The Epistulae ex Ponto, a series of letters in verse explicitly addressed to various people in Rome, asking them to help effect Ovid's return, are thought to be his last compositions. The first three books were published in 13 AD, and the fourth book later, between 14 and 16 AD. Some of these compositions were addressed to Ovid's friends, to his wife, and the Emperor himself: ""Where’s the joy in stabbing your steel into my dead flesh?/ There’s no place left where I can be dealt fresh wounds.""

According to Pliny the Elder, Ovid wrote another poem about fishing while in exile. A fragmentary poem still exists, traditionally attributed to Ovid, called Halieutica, about the ""rules for fishing in rocky, sandy or open waters, distinguishing the kinds of fish which haunt each,""  possibly written with information from local fishers. However, the real authorship of this work is much debated, and Ovid's is denied or doubted by some scholars.

Literary assessment
In his works from exile, principally the Tristia and the Epistulae, Ovid tried to do three things that he hoped would help convince the emperor to end his exile:

Create pity for himself through his descriptions of the hazards and harsh conditions in Tomis. Ovid portrayed himself as old, sick, and away from his family and the pleasures of Rome;
Defend his cause by referring repeatedly to the attitude that led to his exile as stupid, but without any malicious intent, and by referring to his offense as an 'error';
Compliment the emperor, either directly (by praising the emperor's good qualities), or indirectly, by praising the emperor's family, or the successes of the emperor's campaigns.

Much has been written suggesting that what Ovid wrote during this period is entirely different from his earlier works. According to Ovid himself, his exile ruined his former poetic genius.

Ovid
Ancient Roman exiles"," Exile of Ovid In 8, the Emperor Augustus banished the Roman poet Ovid to Tomis on the Black Sea. Ovid had written the Ars Amatoria (The Art of Love), a collection of three books of verse that explained how men could seduce women. Tomis was a Greek colony on the Black Sea coast, located in the area of present-day Romania. Ovid lived there for the next six years. The town was very distant from Rome, and the exiled poet was able to secure a permit from the Emperor to return to Rome for a visit. He stayed in the city for two years, before returning to Tomis. In the following year, 12, Ovid composed the Tristia (Sorrows), a series of five books in which he expressed his discontent at being banished to the edge of the empire, so far from the center of culture and learning in Rome. In the Tristia, Ovid poured out his complaints to his friends and pleaded for their help in securing his recall to Rome. He also published the Epistulae (Letters), a collection of letters to his friends and patrons in Rome, in which he sought their assistance in his hour of need. In the end, Ovid's efforts were successful. The Emperor Augustus, who had been impressed by the poet's abilities, relented and allowed Ovid to return to Rome in 17. After his recall, Ovid composed the Fasti, a six-volume work on the religious festivals of the Roman year. The Fasti is unique among Ovid's works in that it was not written in verse, but in prose. The work provides a valuable record of the religious practices of the Roman world. After the Fasti was published, Ovid died in 17, at the age of 60.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,29020567,0.1738396624472574,0.12631578947368421,0.3023034154090548,0.205607476635514,6,4,0,2,16,1,1,0,0,1,0.3849608385057638,0.028675050214574893,0.014084507042253521,0.03562653562653563,50,2,24,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,12,1,29,1,1,1

The Kraichgau Railway ( ) is a 64.8 km long railway line in the region of Kraichgau in northwestern part of the German state of Baden-Württemberg. It runs from Karlsruhe via Bretten and Eppingen to Heilbronn and was built in 1880. It gained international  renown in 1992 as the first dual-system rail/tram route of the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn, the section between Karlsruhe and Bretten being the prototype for the so-called Karlsruhe model.

Geography

Topography 
The western section of the line runs across the main direction of stream flows in the Kraichgau. These rivers flow in a north-westerly direction, while the line runs north east from Karlsruhe to Eppingen. The resulting transitions between mountains and valleys require a winding route with significant gradients. Overall, it crosses five mountain ridges between the valleys of the Pfinz, Walzbach, Saalbach, Kraichbach, Elsenz and Lein, requiring three tunnels. It only runs for a significant distance in a river valley between Flehingen and Sulzfeld, in this case the valley of the Kohlbach. In the eastern sections the natural conditions are favourable and the line runs largely through the valley of the Lein.

Route 
Services on the Kraichgau Railway cross from the Karlsruhe tram network to the Albtal-Verkehrs-Gesellschaft network after crossing the A 5 and before running through the platforms of Karlsruhe-Durlach station, where they stop at platform tracks 11 and 12, which were built in 1992. There is provision for these platforms to be used by trams, including a turning loop northeast of the station. After crossing the Rhine Valley Railway, running between Karlsruhe and Heidelberg by a bridge on which Hubstraße Stadtbahn stop is located, and running parallel with the Karlsruhe–Mühlacker railway, it changes its safe-working system from the tram operating procedures (BOStrab) to rail operating procedures EBO shortly before Grötzingen.

The Kraichgau Railway branches off at Grötzingen Oberaustraße station, running from Jöhlingen West to Wössingen Ost as a two-track line. At Bretten station it passes over the Württemberg Western Railway on a bridge, which is now served by Karlsruhe Stadtbahn line S 9 and regional service R 91. It has sections of double track from Bretten-Gölshausen to Gölshausen Industriegebiet and Eppingen West to Epping station. The only other sections of double track are near stations. After Eppingen the Steinsfurt–Eppingen line branches off to the left. The Kraichgau Railway is duplicated from Leingarten West. Shortly before Heilbronn Hauptbahnhof, the line crosses the Franconia Railway on the flat and the Stadtbahn services leave the Kraichgau Railway to run over tram tracks to the station forecourt and through the city of Heilbronn.

History

Origins to 1880
By 1870, the central Kraichgau was surrounded by four railway lines. These are:
The Baden Rhine Valley Railway, connecting Heidelberg via Bruchsal to Karlsruhe;
The Württemberg Western Railway, running from Bruchsal via Bretten to Bietigheim;
The Württemberg Northern Railway from Stuttgart to Heilbronn via Bietigheim;
The Baden Odenwald Railway, connecting the Northern Railway, Heidelberg, Meckenheim, Sinsheim and Jagstfeld with Heilbronn.

The square surrounded by these lines comprises a vast territory on the border of Baden and Württemberg around the Baden city of Eppingen. These diverted the traditional trade routes and threatened the general economic development of the Eppingen region, which as a result sought the construction of a railway through the region in order to overcome this disadvantage. The Württemberg city of Heilbronn, which desired better transport links to the west, and Karlsruhe supported this proposal.

This gave rise to a plan for a line from Karlsruhe (more precisely Grötzingen) via Bretten and Eppingen to Heilbronn. In addition to the local needs, the proposed line was also seen to play a role in the larger context, namely the idea of a possible direct line from France towards Nuremberg and from there to the east. Such a direct connection was supported in Heilbronn in preference to a purely Baden route that would have connected Bretten to the Meckenheim–Jagstfeld railway.

The project received approval from state authorities in both countries. The Baden government was not able to quickly implement construction, as it was busy with other railways (mainly the Black Forest Railway). To accelerate construction, the city of Karlsruhe, under Mayor Wilhelm Florentin Lauter, offered to build the Baden section to Eppingen as directed with the Grand Duchy of Baden State Railway to operate the line, initially paying rent and later buying the line by instalments.

The government of Baden went along with this proposal, and so the law authorising its construction was passed on 30 March 1872. Before construction could begin, however, negotiations had to be carried out with Württemberg. This resulted in a treaty agreed to on 29 December 1873, which envisaged other connections between the states in the Neckar Valley and the Kinzig Valley. Württemberg would build the Heilbronn–Eppingen section; Eppingen was identified as the interchange station. The Baden section would cross the Western Railway in Bretten. This was operated along its entire length by Württemberg, including the section through Baden territory between Ruit (near Bretten) and Bruchsal. In order to avoid the operation of a Württemberg-owned railway through Baden territory, Baden claimed the right to repurchase the section the Western Railway situated on its territory, which was its right under the treaty that originally authorised its construction. The negotiations dragged on over several years until a treaty was signed on 15 November 1878 that enabled Baden to acquire the Bruchsal–Bretten section.

Because the Baden railways had a financial crisis, the city of Karlsruhe found it difficult at first to find a contractor to build the line, so that it was not until 15 November 1876 that a contract could be issued. The contractor was Ph. Holzmann & Cie. of Frankfurt am Main. On 15 October 1879, the line was opened from Grötzingen to Eppingen, on 10 October 1878, the Royal Württemberg State Railways opened the section between Heilbronn and Schwaigern and, on 7 August 1880, the gap was closed between Eppingen and Schwaigern. Planning and construction of the Württemberg section came under construction supervisor (Oberbaurat) Carl Julius Abel. During the discussion of the remaining section of the route the council of the then independent municipality of Stetten am Heuchelberg presented the designers with a fait accompli: it built a local station before it was clear that the line would pass through the site at all.

With the completion of the line, the Baden State Railway took up the provision of the original agreement, taking full ownership of the railway, by taking over the balance of Karlsruhe's borrowing for the line for 12 million marks. Patronage on the Kraichgau Railway steadily increased in subsequent years.

1880–1945 
In 1900, the Steinsfurt–Eppingen line was opened connecting the Kraichgau Railway to the Meckenheim–Jagstfeld line. This line runs was along the Elsenz.

The towns of Dürrenbüchig and Gölshausen (now both districts of Bretten) that are located on the Kraichgau Railway had complained about not having stations. Their wishes were finally granted in 1906. In 1888 the Bretten–Eppingen–Heilbronn section of the line was duplicated as part of a military supply route from central Germany via Nuremberg, Crailsheim, Heilbronn, Bretten, Bruchsal, Zweibrücken in the Saarland to Lorraine. The importance of the connection in peacetime, however, remained low, and the administrators of the Kraichgau Railway did not listen to requests for fast trains between Karlsruhe and Würzburg/Nuremberg. However, due to overloading at Stuttgart from 1906 to 1914, a luxury train, the ""Paris–Carlsbad Express"" ran over the Kraichgau Railway. It was considered to be a branch of the Orient Express running via Nuremberg to Carlsbad. The outbreak of the First World War, however, brought an end to this service.

On 31 March 1920 the Baden and Württemberg State Railways were absorbed into the newly founded Deutsche Reichsbahn. Because Germany had to pay war reparations, having lost World War I, there were no funds for further upgrading of the line. Efforts were made in subsequent years to duplicate the remaining single section between Durlach and Bretten, without success. From 1935, the so-called Dieseleiltriebwagen (express diesel railcars) of class VT 137 were used on the line.

Deutsche Bundesbahn (1945–1992)
Towards the end of the Second World War the Kraichgau Railway, like most other German railways, suffered significant damage. As the German army had blown up bridges in Grötzingen and Rinklingen and the line between Karlsruhe and Bretten was impassable for several months, services between Karlsruhe and the Kraichgau had to operate via Bruchsal. At the same time some track was dismantled to allow the re-opening of the Bietigheim viaduct on the only rail link between Karlsruhe and Stuttgart in August 1945.

The era of scheduled steam operations ended in May 1972. From now on services on the Kraichgau Railway were operated with multiple units and locomotives of class 218 and class 212 hauling Silberling carriages. From 1976, Deutsche Bundesbahn published plans to close the line, together with the line between Eppingen and Sinsheim. So it had dismantled most of the continuous double-track section between Bretten and Heilbronn, replacing it with single track. The closure plans then stirred fierce opposition in the community.

In the late 1980s, Class 628 DMUs took over passenger operations. At the same time operation between Bretten and Heilbronn on the weekends were sometimes altered.

Acquisition by AVG, and expansion of light rail (since 1992)
As a result, the Albtal-Verkehrs-Gesellschaft (Alb Valley Transport Company, AVG), an undertaking of the city of Karlsruhe, took over, from about 1990, the funding of the modernisation and electrification of the line as a pilot project. The  electrification system used was the usual Deutsche Bahn system of 15 kV AC.

The Karlsruhe–Bretten-Gölshausen section of the line was opened on 25 September 1992 as line B of the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn network; the first Stadtbahn line, which had operated since 1975 on the Alb Valley Railway, was renamed as line A. While the latter was operated continuously with 750 V direct current, the Kraichgau Railway was the world's first line that changed over the course of its journey from tram and rail operating procedures in addition to the change between AC and DC. This form of operations is known as tram-train and its adoption on the Kraichgau Railway was the final step in the development of the Karlsruhe model.

While the existing stations were modernised, several new stations were established, especially in the town of Bretten, for example, Bretten Stadtmitte in central Bretten. The AVG also restored several sections of double track, while a continuous second track was created from Jöhlingen West to Wössingen Ost. Since all tunnels were built for two tracks, the continuous electrification of the line was possible without great effort because the single track could be moved to the middle of the tunnels.

The success of the new Stadtbahn line was immediate: instead of the previous average of 1,800 passengers using the line between Karlsruhe and Bretten, in early 1993 it was used by 8,500 passengers per day. Patronage even grew on Deutsche Bundesbahn's DMU services on the line.

There were now regular services on Sundays, leading to an increase in the number of rail passengers by up to 30 times. So an extension of Stadtbahn route from Bretten seemed to make sense. In 1996, the remaining DB through trains between Karlsruhe and Heilbronn were abandoned. Henceforth, these only shuttled between Bretten-Gölshausen and Heilbronn.

On 1 June 1997, Stadtbahn services were extended as far as Eppingen, with DB trains operating between Eppingen and Heilbronn. On 26 September 1999, the Stadtbahn was extended to Heilbronn station, following the operation of trial Stadtbahn services between Eppingen and Heilbronn on weekends from March 1999. In 2000, Bretten station was modernised. Since 2001, the trains on the Kraichgau Railway run from Heilbronn station through the city centre and since 2004 though Heilbronn's eastern suburbs. On 10 December 2005 Stadtbahn services were extended to Öhringen after two years of construction on a section of the Hohenlohe Railway.

With a length of 155 km and a travel time of more than 3.5 hours, the Kraichgau Railway became in 2003–2004 part of the longest light railway line in the world, as a continuous run from Freudenstadt on the Murg Valley Railway to Karlsruhe and on to Heilbronn. As these services were prone to delays, they were abandoned with the extension of Stadtbahn services to Öhringen and the alignment was changed to run to Baden-Baden and Achern. The 2005/2006 timetable included a daily continuous service between Freudenstadt and Öhringen with a journey time of 4:14 h.

Operations

Operators
The electrified line is now operated by the Albtal-Verkehrs-Gesellschaft as a section of line S 4 (Öhringen–Heilbronn–Karlsruhe–Rastatt–Achern) with modern electric Stadtbahn vehicles of class GT8-100C/2S and GT8-100D/2S-M. On the sections between Karlsruhe Albtalbahnhof (AVG station) and Karlsruhe Durlach and between Heilbronn Hauptbahnhof and Heilbronn Pfühlpark the services run on tram lines through streets. AVG has leased the line between Karlsruhe-Grötzingen and Heilbronn from Deutsche Bahn for 25 years.

The Karlsruher Verkehrsverbund (Karlsruhe Transport Association, KVV) and the Heilbronner Hohenloher Haller Nahverkehr (Heilbronn Hohenlohe Hall Local Transport, H3NV) coordinate fares on the line on either side of Eppingen. Other transport associations are also affected.

Stations 
The platform height above rail level in Wössingen Ost, Bretten, Gölshausen Industrie and all stations between Eppingen and Heilbronn is 55 cm, thus making possible level access to the Stadtbahn vehicles of class GT 8-100D/2S-M. All other stations have a platform height of 38 cm.

All platforms have a minimum length of 120 m, so that during periods of very high traffic load—especially in the morning peak of work and school transport—three sets of multiple units can be coupled. But, because the central on-street sections in Karlsruhe and Heilbronn are designed only to handle two sets coupled and because of the difficulty of separating and recombining trains for the inner city sections, trains rarely run at maximum length.

The section from Grötzingen (km 0.0) to beyond Eppingen (km 43.5) has the official route number 4201; the following section to Heilbronn (km 140.0 to 118.6) is part of route 4950, which continues to Crailsheim. The zero point for the measurement of the chainage on the Hohenlohe Railway is at Goldshöfe station on the Upper Jagst Railway.

The subsequent stops in Heilbronn's city centre are Bahnhofsvorplatz (with change from EBO to BOStrab procedures and electrification system), Neckar Turm am Kurt-Schumacher-Platz, Rathaus, Harmonie, Friedensplatz, Finanzamt and Pfühlpark. Directly after this station Stadtbahn services operate over a ramp to connect back to the Hohenlohe Railway with a reversal of safeworking procedures from BOStrab to EBO and of the electrification system.

Timetable 
Through trains run between Karlsruhe and Heilbronn twice an hour, with one of the services operating as an ""express train"" with a smaller number of intermediate stops. The travel time between the central squares of the two cities by the stopping trains is 98 minutes and it is 81 minutes by the express trains.

Freight 
Although the Kraichgau Railway connects the cities of Karlsruhe and Heilbronn, freight traffic between the two cities was never significant. Agricultural traffic from the fertile Kraichgau was of significance for the line, especially for the removal of sugar beet during the beet harvest. Deutsche Bahn abandoned this form of transport by the end of 1993 on the  Kraichgau Railway as well as on all other railway lines in Baden-Württemberg. In 2001, the complete cessation of freight traffic on the line was considered as part of the rationalisation of freight operations known as MORA C. Then AVG took over passenger and freight transport on the Kraichgau line between Bretten and Heilbronn, while between Karlsruhe and Bretten there was for some time no freight traffic.

Currently (May 2006) the AVG regularly serves freight sidings in Eppingen (two metal-processing companies and the Raiffeisen cooperative) and in Sulzfeld (a metal processing company).

Karlsruhe Stadtbahn"," The Kraichgau Railway (Kraichgaubahn) is a railway line in the southern German state of Baden-Württemberg. It runs for 24.4 km from the town of Eppingen to the city of Heilbronn. The line was opened in 1875 and was built by the Kraichgau Railway Company (Kraichgaubahn AG), which was subsequently acquired by the Royal Württemberg State Railways in the same year. The Kraichgau line runs through the Kraichgau region, a bowl-shaped area between the Neckar and the Tauber valleys. The line was built as a local railway to link the towns in the Kraichgau with the major city of Heilbronn, which had been connected to Stuttgart and the rest of the rail network of the Kingdom of Württemberg since 1840. The line was also intended to provide a connection to the Main-Neckar Railway, which was being planned by the Grand Duchy of Baden. In fact, the Kraichgau line was not connected to the Main-Neckar line, which was eventually opened by the Baden State Railways in 1877, until the German Railways' Amberg–Pforzheim line was opened in 1904, providing a connection between the two lines at Pforzheim.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Page Fence Giants"", the article should at least have 250 words","The Page Fence Giants were a professional Black-American baseball team based in Adrian, Michigan from 1895 to 1898, performing as one of the nation's top teams in the Negro leagues. Named after the Page Woven Wire Fence Company in Adrian, they were sponsored by its founder, J. Wallace Page.

Formed in 1894, the team played its first game on April 9, 1895. Bud Fowler and Home Run Johnson organized the team, which was managed by Gus Parsons. Fowler chose players who did not drink and aimed for a group with high moral character. Five of the twelve players were college graduates. Fowler played second base, while Johnson manned shortstop. The team played in 112 towns that year against all levels of competition, going 118-36-2. They were 8-7 against clubs from the white Michigan State League (MSL). They lost games by scores of 11-7 and 16-2 against the Cincinnati Reds. The club lost Fowler and pitcher George Wilson to the white Adrian-based team Adrian Demons during the MSL season.

In 1896, Charlie Grant replaced Fowler at second. The Page Fence Giants beat the Cuban X-Giants in a 15-game series, 10 games to 5, to claim they were the top team in black baseball. The clinching game took place in Caro, Michigan, and regular shortstop Home Run Johnson was the winning pitcher that game. Overall they went 80-19 through August 1. In 1897, they went 125-12 with 82 consecutive wins. The 1898 tour was the club's last, as the next year many of the players went to the new Columbia Giants in Chicago.

The outcome of many games were disputed by the Giants' management, due to many games worked by unfair umpires assigned to the games. One published win-loss record was 1895, 121-31; 1896, 143-25; 1897, 129-10; 1898, 107-10.

Notable players

Bud Fowler — (real name is John W. Jackson; born in Cooperstown, New York in 1858) 2B and manager, 1895; was a co-founder of the team, along with Home Run Johnson. Fowler left the team in July 1895 due to a dispute with the remaining team management, consisting of white businessmen, Len W. Hoch (former Adrian mayor and the city postmaster), Augustus ""Gus"" Parsons (Hotel Emery desk clerk), and brothers Rolla and Howard Taylor (co-owners of a hardware/sporting goods store) and all Adrian businessmen. J. Wallace Page, owner of the Page Woven Wire Fence Company, sponsored the team, but the factory did not claim any of the team's profits and only used the ball club as a marketing tool for their fence company.

Charlie Grant — 2B, 1896-1898; nicknamed ""Cincy,"" as he hailed from Cincinnati, Ohio. Replaced Sol White as the Giants' second baseman.
 
Billy Holland — Pitcher, OF, 1895–97; noted as a talented Tenor singer, who would belt out tunes during games. Respected as an excellent ""coacher"" or bench jockey during his career.

Chappie Johnson — LF, 1B, and Catcher, 1896–98; while playing on the same team as Home Run Johnson, Chappie was often referred to as ""Junior, as he was a younger than his teammate.

William Binga - 3B, C and OF, 1895-98; joined the Giants after spending time on a semi-professional team in Pontiac, Michigan earlier in 1895. 

Grant ""Home Run"" Johnson — SS and captain, 1895–98; played with the Findlay (Ohio) Sluggers with Bud Fowler in 1894 where he acquired the nickname for bashing 58 home runs that season. From Findlay, Ohio.

John W. Patterson — 1895, 1896, 1897-98, 1B-3B; manages the team when it leaves Adrian and is sold to Chicago businessmen and becomes the Columbia Giants. Long-time city police officer in Battle Creek, Michigan after his playing career was completed. Died in Battle Creek after a fight with an escaped inmate. 

Sol White — 2B, 1895; joined the Giants in June 1895, following the disbandment of his integrated Fort Wayne, Indiana, minor league team. Replaced the recently departed Bud Fowler at second base. Selected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2006 for his many years of contribution as a player, manager, executive, and black baseball reporter. His famous baseball book, published in 1907, has only a scant mention of his year on the Giants. 

George Wilson — pitcher, 1895-1898; in 1895 split his time with the integrated Adrian Demons of the Michigan State League. Nicknamed the ""Palmyra Wonder"" after the town a few miles east of Adrian, where he was born and raised. Left-handed fireballer, who apparently pitched both overhand, but also could drop down with a submarine type delivery (""upshoot"" pitch), Wilson was one of the top pitchers of this era. Was 29-4 with the Demons in 1895. Never married, he died in 1915 in Kalamazoo, Michigan, where he was committed in their mental health asylum. Wilson is buried with his family members in Palmyra, Michigan.

 Augustus ""Gus"" Brooks, 1895, center field. Brooks died after collapsing in June 1895 during a game in Hastings, Michigan; and died few hours later in a local hotel. He was buried in Adrian's Oakwood Cemetery.

 Joe ""Cannon Ball"" Miller - right-handed pitcher and OF, 1895-1898; left the team in a dispute over allegations of betting on a game in which he was a pitcher. Was later re-signed by the Page Fence Giants.

 Fred Van Dyke - IF-OF-Pitcher; was on the team for several stints in 1895 and 1896.

 Vasco Graham - Catcher, 1895-1896; in 1895 played the bulk of the season with the integrated Adrian Demons of the Michigan State League (low level minors), as did pitcher George Wilson. 

 James Chavous, right-handed pitcher, 1895-96; from Marysville, Ohio. 

 Frank Waters, pitcher; a teen-aged substitute player and a native of Adrian, Michigan who was signed to short emergency stints in 1895 and 1896. 

William Wendell Gaskin, 1895-96; regular team cook on their Monarch train car, appeared a couple of games as a substitute pitcher. Later was known for his award-winning penmanship. 

Wilson, Fowler, Miller, Graham, Binga, and Burns also played games with the Adrian Demons in 1895, the town's entry into the Michigan State League, minor league. The Demons were the only integrated team in the league that season. Gus Parsons, Len Hoch, and the Taylor Brothers were the management group that operated the team in its only year of existence. Its most famous player was Honus Wagner, who played for a three-week period during July 1895 on the integrated Demons squad.

Fowler and Wilson left the team before the end of its first, 1895 season to play in the primarily white Michigan State League. (Riley 295, 873) Wilson posted a 29-4 record with the Adrian Demons that year and was the MSL's leading pitcher by all accounts.

African-American history of Michigan"," The Page Fence Giants were a barnstorming baseball team composed of African American players who challenged the color barrier in the American South during the early part of the 20th century. The team was formed by John A. Heydler, a lawyer and athlete who later became the first president of the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues, the organization that became the parent company of Major League Baseball. The team was named for the Page Fence Company of Adrian, Michigan, where the company's president, John A. Page, had banned discrimination in the company's factories and allowed the team to use the company's athletic facilities. The Page Fence Giants played their first game in 1911, and continued for several years. The team was made up of players from the Negro leagues, most of whom were recruited from the West and Midwest. The team played exhibition games against white major league and minor league teams, challenging the discrimination that kept African Americans out of the white major leagues. They played teams in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and other northern states, as well as in the southern United States, where the team was not allowed to stay in white hotels or eat in white restaurants. The Page Fence Giants were a successful team, and were popular with fans. They played a series of exhibition games against the Detroit Tigers in 1911, and won the series 4 games to 1. They also played the St. Louis Browns, the Boston Red Sox, and the New York Giants, and won most of their games. The team's success helped to pave the way for the integration of the major leagues. The team's most famous player was Hall of Famer Willie Mays, who played for the Giants in the early 1950s. The Page Fence Giants were also instrumental in the formation of the Negro leagues. The team's success helped to convince the owners of the Chicago American Giants and the Indianapolis ABCs to form the first formalized Negro league, the Negro National League, in 1920. The Giants folded in the early 1920s, but their legacy lived on in the Negro leagues and in the integration of the major leagues.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,7264542,0.08607594936708862,0.1368421052631579,0.17013502779984116,0.3146417445482866,7,21,1,0,9,0,0,0,0,1,0.19026915055813823,0.022993091952363914,0.00428058547362607,0.025798525798525797,28,0,9,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,26,1,29,1,1,1
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""2011 Elite League speedway season"", the article should at least have 250 words","The 2011 Elite League speedway season (also known as the Sky Sports Elite League for sponsorship reasons) was the 77th season of the top division of UK speedway and took place between 26 March and 20 October 2011. The Coventry Bees were the defending champions after winning in 2010.

Summary
It was a great season for the Poole Pirates, who won the Elite League, the Pairs Championship and the Knockout Cup. Claiming a clean sweep of honours. Throughout the 2010 season, it was rumoured that the Ipswich Witches would prefer to compete in the Premier League from 2011 onwards. Although they survived the promotion/relegation battle with the Newcastle Diamonds, it was decided that they would swap divisions with the Birmingham Brummies. On 27 November 2010, The BSPA announced that both Coventry Bees and Peterborough Panthers would not be riding in the top flight after they failed to declare their intent to compete in the 2011 competition. This then led to the King's Lynn Stars being promoted from the Premier League due to the Elite League needing a minimum of 8 teams. On 15 March 2011 it was announced that both the Coventry Bees and Peterborough Panthers would be part of the 2011 Elite League after all.

Poole Pirates made up for the previous season's disappointment by winning the league and cup double. The Australian quartet of Darcy Ward, Chris Holder, Davey Watt and Jason Doyle were supported well by Swedes Thomas H. Jonasson and Dennis Andersson as the Poole team deservedly won the title after finishing top of the regular season table for the second consecutive year. The Australian domination also extended to the league averages, which were topped by Chris Holder and the Elite League Riders' Championship won by Rory Schlein of Belle Vue.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Thomas's yellow bat"", the article should at least have 250 words","Thomas's yellow bat (Rhogeessa io) is a species of bat from the family Vespertilionidae.

Taxonomy 
Thomas's yellow bat was given its binomial nomenclature by Oldfield Thomas in 1903 as Rhogeessa io. Synonyms for the species include Rhogeessa bombyx (Thomas, 1913), Rhogeessa riparia (Goodwin, 1958), and Rhogeessa velilla (Thomas, 1903). The Thomas's yellow bat was formerly included as a subspecies of the black-winged little yellow bat, but was considered distinct in 1996.

The species needs taxonomic review for a number of reasons. One of these reasons includes the possibility that subspecies of the Thomas's yellow bat may be their own species.

Range and conservation 
Thomas's yellow bat is native to Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Nicaragua, Panama, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, and Venezuela. It is listed as ""Least Concern"" by the IUCN Red List due to its wide distribution, presumed large population, occurrence in a number of protected areas, having some degree of tolerance to habitat modification, and unlikeliness of population decline at the rate to qualify for a more threatened listing.

Behavior and ecology 
Thomas's yellow bat inhabits many habitats, such as both evergreen and deciduous forest, thorn shrub, open areas, and villages, though it appears to favor slightly disturbed deciduous forests. Like other species in its genus, the Thomas's yellow bat can take refuge in buildings and hollow trees, although its roosts are unknown.

The species is crepuscular, with peaks of activity within an hour of both dusk and of dawn, flying low to the ground along wide trails or roads. The Thomas's yellow bat is an insectivore, feeding on small, flying insects and with established hunting routes among individuals.

The maximum energy of echolocation calls in the Thomas's yellow bat is 50 to 60 kHz.

Mammals described in 1903"," Thomas's yellow bat (storrsella flavigula) is a species of vesper bat in the family Vespertilionidae. It is the only species in the genus Storrsella and the tribe Phaeomyini, which was formerly considered to be a subgenus of the genus Myxophaga. It is found in Central and South America, ranging from Panama and Costa Rica to Bolivia and Brazil. The Thomas's yellow bat is a small species, with a total length of 6 to 8 cm (2.4 to 3.1 in) and a weight of 9 to 15 g (0.32 to 0.49 oz). The fur is short and varies in color, ranging from pale yellow to dark brown. The ears are small and rounded, with a thin, dark border. The tail is short and pointed, with a small notch at the tip. Thomas's yellow bat is a solitary species, and is typically found in small groups of up to 20 individuals. It is a insectivorous species, and feeds on a variety of small invertebrates, including flies, mosquitoes, and moths. The species has a slow and cautious approach to prey, and feeds by gleaning insects from the foliage of trees and bushes. Thomas's yellow bat is a seasonal breeder, with breeding typically occurring during the dry season, from June to August. The species forms monogamous pairs and the female gives birth to one or two young. The young are born helpless and are completely dependent on their mother for the first few weeks of life. Thomas's yellow bat is a widespread species and is found in a variety of habitats, including forests, grasslands, and even urban areas. It is a adaptable species and is able to utilize a variety of different food sources, making it a relatively successful species. However, the species is threatened by habitat loss and degradation, as well as competition with other species, such as the Mexican fishing myotis.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,38891692,0.02761795166858458,0.1368421052631579,0.11464124966904951,0.235202492211838,2,2,0,0,7,1,0,0,0,1,0.10809596879105601,0.017388882158079023,0.0006904170118751726,0.022113022113022112,3,0,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3,1,9,0,0,1

This article will give an overview of the history of Maltese-language literature.

History

Written Maltese 
As Maltese evolved after Count Roger I of Sicily ended Arab rule on the island at the end of the 11th century, there was little interest in developing a written form of the language. Initially only the clergy, aristocracy and bourgeoisie were able to read and write and much of their communication was conducted in Latin. Throughout the centuries use of the Maltese language was often discouraged with varying enthusiasm, ostensibly in the hope that supplanting it would strengthen ties with the country which held possession of Malta at that particular point in time. Under the Knights of St John both Italian and French were used for official documents and correspondence. During the British colonial period the use of English was encouraged through education, with Italian regarded as the next most influential language. It was not until 1936 that Maltese was recognised as the island's official language. Uniquely, no other European country lacked a standardised written form of its language until the 19th century, when men such as Mikiel Anton Vassalli made a concerted effort to transcribe spoken Maltese into a written form, although examples of written Maltese exist from as early as the 15th century.

Diglossia
The development of native Maltese literary works has historically been hampered by the diglossia that has characterized the culture of Malta throughout its history. For many centuries, Maltese was known as the language ""of the kitchen and the workshop"", while Italian was the language of education, literature, the arts, law and commerce.  Hence, until the early 20th century, the vast majority of literary works in Malta were written in Italian by the community of Maltese Italians. In early Maltese history, diglossia manifested itself in the co-existence of a developed form of Siculo-Arabic and the language of a series of rulers, most notably Latin, Greek, Sicilian, French, Spanish and Italian. From 1800 onwards these were largely supplanted by English. The Maltese language is today heavily overlaid with Romance and English influences as a result.

According to Prof. Oliver Friggieri:

Maltese writers developed an uninterrupted local ""Italian"" literary movement which went on up to about four decades ago, whereas Maltese as a literary idiom started to coexist on a wide scale in the last decades of the 19th century. Whilst Maltese has the historical priority on the level of the spoken language, Italian has the priority of being the almost exclusive written medium, for the socio-cultural affairs, for the longest period. The native tongue had only to wait for the arrival of a new mentality which could integrate an unwritten, popular tradition with a written, academically respectable one.

The emergence of Maltese literature
The oldest known literary text in the Maltese language is Pietru Caxaro's poem, Il-Kantilena (c. 1470 to 1485) (also known as Xidew il-Qada), followed by Gian Francesco Bonamico's sonnet of praise to Grand Master Nicolas Cotoner, Mejju gie' bl'Uard, u Zahar (The month of May has arrived, with roses and orange blossoms), c. 1672. The earliest known Maltese dictionary was written by Francois de Vion Thezan Court (c. 1640). In 1700, an anonymous Gozitan poet wrote Jaħasra Mingħajr Ħtija (Unfortunately Innocent). A Maltese translation of the Lord's Prayer appeared in Johannes Heinrich Maius's work Specimen Lingua Punicæ in hodierna Melitensium superstitis (1718), demonstrating the formerly wide-held belief that the language had a Punic heritage. A collection of religious sermons by a certain Dun Ignazio Saverio Mifsud, published between 1739 and 1746, is regarded as the earliest known example of Maltese prose.

An anonymous poem entitled Fuqek Nitħaddet Malta (I am talking about you, Malta), was written c. 1749, regarding the Conspiracy of the Slaves. A few years later, in 1752, a catechism entitled Tagħlim Nisrani ta' Dun Franġisk Wizzino (Don Francesco Wizzino's Christian Teachings) was published in both Maltese and Italian. The occasion of Carnival in 1760 saw the publication of a collection of burlesque verses under the heading Żwieġ la Maltija (Marriage, in the Maltese Style), by Dun Feliċ Demarco.

A child of the Romantic movement, Maltese patriot Mikiel Anton Vassalli (1764–1829) hailed the emergence of literary Maltese as ""one of the ancient patrimonies...of the new emerging nation"" and saw this nascent trend as: (1) the affirmation of the singular and collective identity, and (2) the cultivation and diffusion of the national speech medium as the most sacred component in the definition of the patria and as the most effective justification both for a dominated community's claim to be a nation and for the subsequent struggle against foreign rulers.

Between 1798 and 1800, while Malta was under French occupation, a Maltese translation of L-Għanja tat-Trijonf tal-Libertà (Ode to the Triumph of Liberty), by Citizen La Coretterie, Secretary to the French Government Commissioner, was published on the occasion of Bastille Day.

The first translation into Maltese of a biblical text, the Gospel of St. John, was published in 1822 (trans. Ġużeppi Marija Cannolo), on the initiative of the Bible Society in Malta. The first Maltese language newspaper, l-Arlekkin Jew Kawlata Ingliża u Maltija (The Harlequin, or a mix of English and Maltese) appeared in 1839, and featured the poems l-Imħabba u Fantasija (Love and Fantasy) and Sunett (A Sonnett).

The first epic poem in Maltese, Il-Ġifen Tork (The Turkish Caravel), by Giovanni Antonio Vassallo, was published in 1842, followed by Ħrejjef bil-Malti (Legends in Maltese) and Ħrejjef u Ċajt bil-Malti (Legends and Jokes in Maltese) in 1861 and 1863 respectively. The same author published the first history book in the Maltese language entitled Storja ta’ Malta Miktuba għall-Poplu (The People's History of Malta) in 1862.

1863 saw the publication of the first novel in Maltese, Elvira Jew Imħabba ta’ Tirann (Elvira, or the Love of a Tyrant) by the Neapolitan author, Giuseppe Folliero de Luna. Anton Manwel Caruana's novel Ineż Farruġ (1889), the first Maltese novel, was modelled on traditional Italian historical novels, such as Manzoni's I promessi sposi and has been the subject of recent scholarly attention.

Poetry

Il-Kantilena 
Il-Kantilena is the oldest written text known to exist in Maltese, dating from no later than 1485, the death of Pietru Caxaro, the author it is attributed to. It wasn't rediscovered until 1966 or 1968 by Prof. Godfrey Wettinger and Fr. Mikiel Fsadni in the Valletta Notarial Archives. Frans Sammut published a revolutionary interpretation of it in 2009. Karmenu Mallia translated it into Esperanto and wrote an article about it in 'Literatura Foiro'.

Contemporary literature 

The post-War years saw the emergence of Moviment Qawmien Letterarju (Literary Revival Movement) in 1967, an avant-garde literary movement the protagonists of which included Oliver Friggieri (later Professor of Maltese at the University of Malta), Frans Sammut (1945–2011), the ""national author"", Alfred Sant (who was Prime Minister from 1996 to 1998), Lino Spiteri (who was Finance Minister in two Governments), and others.

Among Oliver Friggieri's most important works is the collection of his poems.

Frans Sammut's reputation is built on his novels Il-Gaġġa (on which the film with the same name is based), Samuraj, Paceville and Il-Ħolma Maltija (translated in Esperanto as La Malta Revo).
Alfred Sant is known for his theatre collected mostly in his Fid-Dell tal-Katidral u Drammi Ohra, whereas Lino Spiteri became renowned for his novel Rivoluzzjoni Do Minore and his short stories.

The Moviment Qawmien Letterarju scene eventually gave way to a new wave of writers, whose voices have shaped the contemporary literature scene. Foremost amongst these are writers such as Albert Marshall, Immanuel Mifsud, Adrian Grima, and Antoine Cassar. The contemporary scene has also seen the emergence of a new generation of female writers including Simone Inguanez, Nadia Mifsud, Simone Galea, Elizabeth Grech and Clare Azzopardi.

Nowadays Maltese literature is dominated by literature in the Maltese language (e.g., Alex Vella Gera, Guze' Stagno), some works in English (Francis Ebejer for instance), and some works in Italian, such as the poems of Judge J.J. Cremona and Albert Caruana's ebook Il Sindaco di Racalmusci.

Radio Interviews"," Maltese literature Maltese literature is the literature of the Maltese people, which is in the process of becoming a separate ethnic and national group, the Maltese. The first work of Maltese literature is the ll-Ilibre tar-Rummo, a 16th-century pastoral romance by Antonio de Vezzosi. The national epic of Malta is The Great Siege (1565), byRemix Censu. In 1607, the Carmelite priest and professor of philosophy Peter Caxaro wrote what is considered to be the first major work of Maltese literature, his Latini Ebraici: Luqmani, a translation of the Septuagint into Maltese. Caxaro's work was followed by a number of other Jewish-Maltese translations of the Old Testament, including that of 1636 by Mordecai Farrugia. These works are important because they helped to develop a standardized language among the Jewish and Christian Maltese communities. The first known Maltese dictionary was also written by a Jewish author, Samuel Benjamin Ben Hamo, in the early 18th century. Ben Hamo's work contains many examples of early Maltese poetry, which like most Maltese poetry written before the 20th century is in the form of the sonnet or other traditional verse forms. The most significant poet of this period was Pietru Caxaro (1634–1716), who is best known for his long poem L-Iblein. In the early 19th century, a number of poets began to move away from the traditional forms and to write in a more modern style. The best known of these was Dun Karm, who is credited as the first to have broken with tradition and to have written verse in the modern Maltese language. In the 20th century, the poets started to introduce new themes, such as social and political commentary, the importance of the Maltese language, and the relationship between Malta and England. The most important poets of this period were Ġużè Muscat, Robert Samut, and Joe Friggieri. In the 21st century, Maltese literature has been strongly influenced by the work of two poets, Adrian Grima and Antoine Cassar. Grima's work is characterized by a return to traditional verse forms, as well as by its engagement with social and political issues. Cassar's work is notable for its exploration of the relationship between Malta and its history, and for its use of experimental forms.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,11974834,0.05842259006815968,0.1368421052631579,0.23129875155292154,0.32866043613707163,10,12,0,0,10,1,1,1,0,1,0.16117880701752638,0.018155339792521492,0.011046672190002762,0.02334152334152334,7,0,21,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,13,1,25,1,1,1
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""European mink"", the article should at least have 250 words","The European mink (Mustela lutreola), also known as the Russian mink and Eurasian mink, is a semiaquatic species of mustelid native to Europe.

It is similar in colour to the American mink, but is slightly smaller and has a less specialized skull. Despite having a similar name, build and behaviour, the European mink is not closely related to the American mink, being much closer to the European polecat and Siberian weasel (kolonok). The European mink occurs primarily by forest streams unlikely to freeze in winter. It primarily feeds on voles, frogs, fish, crustaceans and insects.

The European mink is listed by the IUCN as Critically Endangered due to an ongoing reduction in numbers, having been calculated as declining more than 50% over the past three generations and expected to decline at a rate exceeding 80% over the next three generations. European mink numbers began to shrink during the 19th century, with the species rapidly becoming extinct in some parts of Central Europe. During the 20th century, mink numbers declined all throughout their range, the reasons for which having been hypothesised to be due to a combination of factors, including climate change, competition with (as well as diseases spread by) the introduced American mink, habitat destruction, declines in crayfish numbers and hybridisation with the European polecat. In Central Europe and Finland, the decline preceded the introduction of the American mink, having likely been due to the destruction of river ecosystems, while in Estonia, the decline seems to coincide with the spread of the American mink.

Evolution and taxonomy
Fossil finds of the European mink are very rare, thus indicating the species is either a relative newcomer to Europe, probably having originated in North America, or a recent speciation caused by hybridization. It likely first arose in the Middle Pleistocene, with several fossils in Europe dated to the Late Pleistocene being found in caves and some suggesting early exploitation by humans. Genetic analyses indicate, rather than being closely related to the American mink, the European mink's closest relative is the European polecat (perhaps due to past hybridization) and the Siberian weasel, being intermediate in form between true polecats and other members of the genus. The closeness between the mink and polecat is emphasized by the fact the species can hybridize.

Subspecies
, seven subspecies are recognised.

Description

Build

The European mink is a typical representative of the genus Mustela, having a greatly elongated body with short limbs. However, compared to its close relative, the Siberian weasel, the mink is more compact and less thinly built, thus approaching ferrets and European polecats in build. The European mink has a large, broad head with short ears. The limbs are short, with relatively well-developed membranes between the digits, particularly on the hind feet. The mink's tail is short, and does not exceed half the animal's body length (constituting about 40% of its length). The European mink's skull is less elongated than the kolonok's, with more widely spaced zygomatic arches and has a less massive facial region. In general characteristics, the skull is intermediate in shape between that of the Siberian weasel and the European polecat. Overall, the skull is less specialized for carnivory than that of polecats and the American mink. Males measure  in body length, while females measure . Tail length is  in males and . Overall weight is  . It is a fast and agile animal, which swims and dives skilfully. It is able to run along stream beds, and stay underwater for one to two minutes. When swimming, it paddles with both its front and back limbs simultaneously.

Fur

The winter fur of the European mink is very thick and dense, but not long, and quite loosely fitting. The underfur is particularly dense compared with that of more land-based members of the genus Mustela. The guard hairs are quite coarse and lustrous, with very wide contour hairs which are flat in the middle, as is typical in aquatic mammals. The length of the hairs on the back and belly differ little, a further adaptation to the European mink's semiaquatic way of life. The summer fur is somewhat shorter, coarser and less dense than the winter fur, though the differences are much less than in purely terrestrial mustelids.

In dark coloured individuals, the fur is dark brown or almost blackish-brown, while light individuals are reddish brown. Fur colour is evenly distributed over the whole body, though in a few cases, the belly is a bit lighter than the upper parts. In particularly dark individuals, a dark, broad dorsal belt is present. The limbs and tail are slightly darker than the trunk. The face has no colour pattern, though its upper and lower lips and chin are pure white. White markings may also occur on the lower surface of the neck and chest. Occasionally, colour mutations such as albinos and white spots throughout the pelage occur. The summer fur is somewhat lighter, and dirty in tone, with more reddish highlights.

Differences from American mink
The European mink is similar to the American mink, but with several important differences. The tail is longer in the American species, almost reaching half its body length. The winter fur of the American mink is denser, longer and more closely fitting than that of the European mink. Unlike the European mink, which has white patches on both upper and lower lips, the American mink almost never has white marks on the upper lip. The European mink's skull is much less specialised than the American species' in the direction of carnivory, bearing more infantile features, such as a weaker dentition and less strongly developed projections. The European mink is reportedly less efficient than the American species underwater.

Behaviour

Territorial and denning behaviours

The European mink does not form large territories, possibly due to the abundance of food on the banks of small water bodies. The size of each territory varies according to the availability of food; in areas with water meadows with little food, the home range is , though it is more usual for territories to be . Summer territories are smaller than winter territories. Along shorelines, the length of a home range varies from , with a width of .

The European mink has both a permanent burrow and temporary shelters. The former is used all year except during floods, and is located no more than  from the water's edge. The construction of the burrow is not complex, often consisting of one or two passages  in diameter and  in length, leading to a nest chamber measuring . Nesting chambers are lined with straw, moss, mouse wool and bird feathers. It is more sedentary than the American mink, and will confine itself for long periods in its burrow in very cold weather.

Reproduction and development
During the mating season, the sexual organs of the female enlarge greatly and become pinkish-lilac in colour, which is in contrast with the female American mink, whose organs do not change. In the Moscow Zoo, estrus was observed on 22–26 April, with copulation lasting from 15 minutes to an hour. The average litter consists of three to seven kits. At birth, kits weigh about , and grow rapidly, trebling their weight 10 days after birth. They are born blind; the eyes open after 30–31 days. The lactation period lasts 2.0 to 2.5 months, though the kits eat solid food after 20–25 days. They accompany the mother on hunting expeditions at the age of 56–70 days, and become independent at the age 70–84 days.

Diet
The European mink has a diverse diet consisting largely of aquatic and riparian fauna. Differences between its diet and that of the American mink are small. Voles are the most important food source, closely followed by crustaceans, frogs and water insects. Fish are an important food source in floodlands, with cases being known of European minks catching fish weighing . The European mink's daily food requirement is . In times of food abundance, it caches its food.

Range and status
The European mink is mostly restricted to Europe. Its range was widespread in the 19th century, with a distribution extending from northern Spain in the west to the river Ob (just east of the Urals) in the east, and from the Archangelsk region in the north to the northern Caucasus in the south. Over the last 150 years, though, it has severely declined by more than 90% and been extirpated or greatly reduced over most of its former range. The current range includes an isolated population in northern Spain and western France, which is widely disjunct from the main range in Eastern Europe (Latvia, Estonia, Belarus, Ukraine, central regions of European Russia, the Danube Delta in Romania and northwestern Bulgaria). It occurs from sea level to . In Estonia, the European mink population has been successfully re-established on the island of Hiiumaa, and there are plans for repeating the process on the nearby island of Saaremaa.

Decline

The earliest actual records of decreases in European mink numbers occurred in Germany, having already become extinct in several areas by the middle of the 18th century. A similar pattern occurred in Switzerland, with no records of minks being published in the 20th century. Records of minks in Austria stopped by the late 18th century. By the 1930s-1950s, the European mink became extinct in Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and possibly Bulgaria. In Finland, the main decline occurred in the 1920s-1950s and the species was thought to be extinct in the 1970s, though a few specimens were reported in the 1990s. In Latvia, the European mink was thought to be extinct for years, until a specimen was captured in 1992. In Lithuania, the last specimens were caught in 1978–79. The decline of the European mink in Estonia and Belarus was rapid during the 1980s, with only a few small, fragmented populations in the northeastern regions of both countries being reported in the 1990s. The decline of European mink numbers in Ukraine began in the late 1950s, with now only a few small and isolated populations being reported in the upper courses of the Ukrainian Carpathian rivers. Their numbers in Moldova began to drop very quickly in the 1930s, with the last known population having been confined to the lower course of the River Prut on the Romanian border by the late 1980s. In Romania, the European mink was very common and widely distributed, with 8000–10,000 being captured in 1960. Currently, Romanian mink populations are confined to the Danube Delta. In European Russia, the European mink was common and widespread in the early 20th century, but began to decline during the 1950s-1970s. The core of their range was in the Tver Region, though they began to decline there by the 1990s, which was worsened by a colonisation of the area by the American mink. Between 1981 and 1989, 388 European minks were introduced to two of the Kurile Islands, though by the 1990s, the population there was found to be lower than that originally released. In France and Spain, an isolated range occurs, extending from Brittany to northern Spain. Data from the 1990s indicate the European mink has disappeared from the northern half of this previous range.

Possible reasons for decline

Habitat loss
Habitat-related declines of European mink numbers may have started during the Little Ice Age, which was further aggravated by human activity. As the European mink is more dependent on wetland habitats than the American species, its decline in Central Europe, Estonia, Finland, Russia, Moldova and Ukraine has been linked to the drainage of small rivers. In mid-19th-century Germany, for example, European mink populations declined in a decade due to expanded land drainage. Although land improvement and river dredging certainly resulted in population decreases and fragmentation, in areas which still maintain suitable river ecosystems, such as Poland, Hungary, the former Czechoslovakia, Finland and Russia, the decline preceded the change in wetland habitats, and may have been caused by extensive agricultural development.

Overhunting
The European mink was historically hunted extensively, particularly in Russia, where in some districts, the decline prompted a temporary ban on mink hunting to let the population recover. In the early 20th century, 40–60,000 European minks were caught annually in the Soviet Union, with a record of 75,000 individuals (an estimate which exceeds the modern global European mink population). In Finland, annual mink catches reached 3000 specimens in the 1920s. In Romania, 10,000 minks were caught annually around 1960. However, this reason alone cannot account for the decline in areas where hunting was less intense, such as in Germany.

Decline of crayfish
The decline of European crayfish has been proposed as a factor in the drop in mink numbers, as minks are notably absent in the eastern side of the Urals, where crayfish are also absent. The decline in mink numbers has also been linked to the destruction of crayfish in Finland during the 1920s-1940s, when the crustaceans were infected with crayfish plague. The failure of the European mink to expand west to Scandinavia coincides with the gap in crayfish distribution.

Competition with the American mink and disease
The American mink was introduced and released in Europe during the 1920s-1930s. The American mink is less dependent on wetland habitats than the European mink and is 20-40% larger. The impact of feral American minks on European mink populations has been explained through the competitive exclusion principle and because the American mink reproduces a month earlier than the European species, and matings between male American minks and female European minks result in the embryos being reabsorbed. Thus, female European minks impregnated by male American minks are unable to reproduce with their conspecifics. Disease spread by the American mink can also account for the decline. Though the presence of the American mink has coincided with the decline of European mink numbers in Belarus and Estonia, the decline of the European mink in some areas preceded the introduction of the American mink by many years, and there are areas in Russia where the American species is absent, though European mink populations in these regions are still declining.

Diseases spread by the American mink can also account for the decline. Twenty-seven helminth species are recorded to infest the European mink, consisting of 14 trematodes, two cestodes and 11 nematodes. The mink is also vulnerable to pulmonary filariasis, krenzomatiasis and skrjabingylosis. In the Leningrad and Pskov Oblasts, 77.1% of European minks were found to be infected with skrjabingylosis.

Hybridisation and competition with the European polecat

In the early 20th century, northern Europe underwent a warm climatic period which coincided with an expansion of the range of the European polecat. The European mink possibly was gradually absorbed by the polecat due to hybridisation. Also, competition with the polecat has greatly increased, due to landscape change favouring the polecat. There is one record of a polecat attacking a mink and dragging it to its burrow.

Polecat-mink hybrids are termed khor'-tumak by furriers and khonorik by fanciers. Such hybridisation is very rare in the wild, and typically only occurs where European minks are declining. A polecat-mink hybrid has a poorly defined facial mask, yellow fur on the ears, grey-yellow underfur and long, dark brown guard hairs. Fairly large, the males attain the peak sizes known for European polecats (weighing  and measuring  in length), and females are much larger than female European minks (weighing  and measuring  in length). The majority of polecat-mink hybrids have skulls bearing greater similarities to those of polecats than to minks. Hybrids can swim well like minks and burrow for food like polecats. They are very difficult to tame and breed, as males are sterile, though females are fertile. The first captive polecat-mink hybrid was created in 1978 by Soviet zoologist Dr. Dmitry Ternovsky of Novosibirsk. Originally bred for their fur (which was more valuable than that of either parent species), the breeding of these hybrids declined as European mink populations decreased. Studies on the behavioural ecology of free-ranging polecat-mink hybrids in the upper reaches of the Lovat River indicate the hybrids will stray from aquatic habitats more readily than pure minks, and will tolerate both parent species entering their territories, though the hybrid's larger size (especially the male's) may deter intrusion. During the summer period, the diet of wild polecat-mink hybrids is more similar to that of the mink than to the polecat, as they feed predominantly on frogs. During the winter, their diets overlap more with those of polecats, and will eat a larger proportion of rodents than in the summer, though they still rely heavily on frogs and rarely scavenge ungulate carcasses as the polecat does.

Predation
Predators of the European mink include the European polecat, the American mink, the golden eagle, large owls and the red fox. Red fox numbers have increased greatly in areas where the wolf and Eurasian lynx have been extirpated, as well as areas where modern forestry is practised. As red foxes are known to prey on mustelids, excessive fox predation on the European mink is a possible factor, though it is improbable to have been a factor in Finland, where fox numbers were low during the early 20th century.

Semiaquatic mammals"," European mink The European mink (Mustela lutreola), also known as the common mink, is a species of mustelid native to Europe and parts of Russia. It is a small, semiaquatic carnivore that is closely related to the North American mink (M. vison). In the past, it was considered to be a subspecies of the latter species, but it is now regarded as a separate species. The European mink occurs in a variety of aquatic habitats, such as lakes, streams, rivers, and wetlands, and also occupies forests and grasslands. It is a solitary and nocturnal species that feeds mainly on small mammals, fish, and birds. The European mink is found in Europe from the British Isles and France in the west to the Soviet Union in the east. It has been reported as far south as Italy and Turkey, and as far north as Norway and Finland. In Russia, it occurs in the areas east of the Ural Mountains and south of the Polar Urals. It is thought to have been introduced to the British Isles after the last ice age, probably by a land bridge from the European continent to Great Britain during the warmer interglacial periods. The European mink is a small, slender animal with a long, thin nose and pointed ears. The fur is typically dark brown or blackish-brown on the head and body, with some white on the chin and throat. The tail is relatively short, measuring less than a third of the animal's total length. The European mink has webbed feet and a flattened skull, which are adapted for an aquatic lifestyle. The European mink is solitary and territorial, with a range of up to 1 km2 (0.39 sq mi). It marks its territory with scent markings and does not share its territory with other minks. It typically lives in small family groups, and the young may stay with their parents for up to a year. The European mink is generally nocturnal, but it may also be active during the day. It feeds mainly on small mammals, fish, and birds, and occasionally also eats insects. It is an effective predator and is known to take down animals as large as rabbits. The European mink is generally considered to be a beneficial species, as it helps to keep populations of small mammals in check. It is also valued for its fur, which is used in the fur trade. However, it is a vulnerable species and is threatened by habitat loss, pollution, and diseases such as the mink enteritis virus (MEV). In some areas, it is also affected by competition with the North American mink, which has been introduced and is now widespread in Europe.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,890259,0.1505302771125556,0.21052631578947367,0.32427423452046167,0.4501557632398754,8,12,1,0,7,1,1,0,0,1,0.2330313190613448,0.013218716452882414,0.005385252692626346,0.013513513513513514,20,0,26,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,14,1,27,1,1,1

""Hard to Get"" was followed by ""I Can't Take It"", which samples the 1979 hit ""Funkytown"" by Lipps Inc., and ""Bombshell"", which samples the song ""Tainted Love"" by Soft Cell. ""Bombshell"" was the most successful of all Max C. singles, peaking at number 7 in the Dutch charts. After the success of Max C., Sandy began producing for other acts, including Doop (a project of DJ Paul Elstak), with whom he had a number-one hit in the Netherlands in 1995, and Master Blaster, with whom he had a number-one hit in the same year.

The Commission will be a recommendation body with the primary responsibility of suggesting major expenditure reforms that will enable the government to reduce and manage its fiscal deficit at more sustainable levels.

The EMC is a five-member body composed of the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Bimal Jalan, who has been appointed to head the Commission, former Finance Secretary Sumit Bose, former Deputy RBI Governor Subir Gokarn and two other members.

Despite the legal mandate intended to lower the Fiscal Deficit to 3 per cent within the stipulated time Fiscal Responsibility and Budgetary Management Act, 2003, India has witnessed a persistent high fiscal deficit. Subsidies, public services, underpricing and arbitrary natural resource allocation are government activities that have led to expenditures greater than revenue. 

The commission is mandated to evaluate proposals for reducing the three major subsidies (i.e. food, fertilizer and oil).

The commission was to submit an interim report before the presentation of the Budget for 2015–16. The final report was to be submitted before the 2016-17 budget.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""List of Paul McCartney concert tours"", the article should at least have 250 words","English musician Paul McCartney has participated in a number of concert tours across several eras of his musical career. With the British–American rock band Wings, he undertook five major tours, with one, the Wings Over the World tour, being worldwide. Following Wings' final 1979 tour of the UK, McCartney did not undergo a major concert tour for ten years. As a solo artist, McCartney has undergone sixteen major concert tours, nine being worldwide. His first was The Paul McCartney World Tour (1989–90) and his most recent being the 2018–20 Freshen Up tour.

With Wings

The British–American rock band Wings was Paul McCartney's post-Beatles band who were active from 1971 to 1981. Their primary line-up was McCartney, his wife Linda and guitarist Denny Laine, formerly of the Moody Blues. Throughout their years as a band, they embarked on a number of concert tours, varying in scale from their initial ""DIY"" tour of British universities to the epic Wings Over the World tour.

Shortly after forming Wings, the McCartneys took the band on an impromptu tour of the United Kingdom's universities in early 1972, showing up unannounced and performing for whoever happened to be on campus. The band's intended first stop on the tour, Ashby-de-la-Zouch, refused to allow them to play, so the band moved on to the more receptive University of Nottingham. Admission to the first show was £0.50, proceeds being split up equally among the band members.

The last Concert for the People of Kampuchea on 29 December 1979, which was the final date of Wings' fifth tour, was Wings' final gig.  

However, Wings achieved notoriety for its aborted sixth tour, a January 1980 tour of Japan, which was cancelled before it even started when Paul McCartney was arrested for possession of marijuana while entering Japan on 16 January 1980 and was eventually deported on 25 January after nine days in prison, without Wings ever performing.  Wings never again attempted a tour prior to their breakup in 1981.

List of Wings tours
Wings University Tour – 11 shows in the UK, 1972
Wings Over Europe Tour – 26 shows throughout Europe, 1972
Wings 1973 UK Tour – 21 shows in the UK, 1973

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""La Merced Market"", the article should at least have 250 words","The La Merced Market is a traditional public market located in the eastern edge of the historic center of Mexico City and is the largest retail traditional food market in the entire city. The area, also called La Merced, has been synonymous with commercial activity since the early colonial period when traders arrived here from other parts of New Spain. At one time, nearly the entire neighborhood was filled with market stalls and in the 1860s it was decided to build a permanent market on the grounds of the old La Merced monastery. In the first half of the 20th century, this market was the major wholesaler for the entire city. This ended when the Central de Abasto was opened in the 1980s, but La Merced remains the largest traditional retail market. The market area is also known for flagrant prostitution in which women can be seen soliciting at all hours of the day and night. It is estimated that about one third of these prostitutes are underage.

Location
La Merced is located east of the main plaza or Zocalo in several very large buildings, and is the city's largest traditional retail market. Metro La Merced has openings both just outside the market and inside one of the buildings. Outside the buildings, the unofficial market or “tianguis” continues on the sidewalks and streets between this market and the Zocalo. This kind of commerce is illegal, but laws against it are only intermittently enforced as unemployment is high, and peddlers pay bribes to local bosses who in turn pay bribes to local officials. This means that both inside and outside the market, pedestrian traffic jams are frequent, making pushing and shoving necessary and socially acceptable. The market area also generates about 450 tons of trash daily.

History

The name La Merced is synonymous with commerce in the city. The market and neighborhood is located on the far eastern side of the original layout of Mexico City after the Conquest. Here many traders arrived with wares from near and far. The market is named after the neighborhood, La Merced, which in turn was named after the monastery Nuestra Señora de la Merced de Redención de Cautivos established in 1594 and simply called the monastery of La Merced. Most of this monastery has since disappeared, leaving only its cloister with its Plateresque decoration. The neighborhood is an old one, and stories and legends, such as the whispers of Doña Esperanza Goyeneche de Ruiz Garcia who died here. Another involves an indigenous chief who received money for being a spy for the Spaniards and was found out. It is said that when this happened, he sat still never moving until he died of sadness.

By the end of the 18th century, almost the entire neighborhood was one great market, which became bigger when the markets of the Zocalo area were banished around the same time. In the 19th century, the famous Circo Orrín with the first Mexican clown Ricardo Bell of Pachuca regularly stopped near this market.

In the 1860s, it was decided to put the market under a roof, and the buildings were constructed on the old monastery grounds. In 1863, the first permanent buildings were constructed. By the early 20th century La Merced was the major wholesale and retail market of Mexico City, especially for foodstuffs. It continued to be the wholesale market for the city during the post-Mexican Revolution period until about the 1960s. At that time, the Central de Abasto market was created in the south of the city to take over and modernize the wholesaling of foodstuffs, especially produce and meat. La Merced continues to be the largest retail traditional market of Mexico City for a wide variety of everyday products such as fruit, vegetables, meat, poultry, toys, clothes; flowers, candy and more.

In 1988, a fireworks stand in La Merced exploded, which killed more than 60 people. In 1998, a major fire destroyed two-thirds of the main hall of the market, along with 572 stalls selling dried chili peppers, fruit, vegetables, shoes and piñatas in the early morning hours of 4 May. No one was killed or injured and the cause was suspected to be faulty wiring. It took over 100 firemen more than three hours to get the fire under control.

Inside the market

The largest building of the complex is dedicated mostly to the sale of fruits and vegetables. Other buildings sell household items such as juicers, tinware, spoons, cleaning supplies and much more. There is constant movement of people here, with many shouting out to potential customers. Work begins here in the very early morning hours and ends in the evening. The market is filled at all hours with truck drivers, sellers, buyers, butchers and cooks.

Basic Mexican foodstuffs is the backbone of this markets selling Mexican spices such as epazote, chili peppers fresh and dried of just about every variety, nopals (cactus pads),  pig skins fried whole, corn, and uncommon items such as wild mushrooms including a variety that look like chantrelle but denser. One of the few places to find truly authentic Oaxaca cheese in the city.  Vendors can be seen tying stacks of banana leaves, cutting spines from nopals, and selling “secret” herbal remedies.

La Merced, like most Mexican traditional markets, is a favored place to eat Mexican street food, called “antojitos” (lit. cravings). Two specialties here are quesadillas and tostadas. Quesadillas can be had with a variety of fillings along with the cheese (typically Oaxaca cheese) such as stewed pork stomach, pickled pork fat, huitlacoche (corn fungus) and squash flowers. The quesadillas sold here are typically long and cooked on a comal, often from blue corn dough. It is topped with red or green chili peppers that have been blended with onions and salt into a watery paste. Like the quesadillas, tostadas have a wide variety of toppings and the crunchy tortilla sometimes has unusual flavorings such as sesame seeds and chipotle.

Prostitution
Merced is considered to be a “tolerance zone” for prostitution, meaning that police generally do not intervene.  Prostitution exists in just about all parts of Mexico City but it is most obvious here. At almost any hour of the day, scantily clad women can be seen walking around. Many of these prostitutes are underage. Prices can be as low as US$15 for an “encuentro” (encounter). Many small hotels are near here, some of which charge as little as 30 pesos for an hour or about 200 for a night. Many of the customers are truck drivers who have time while their vehicles are being unloaded at the market. In 2007-2008 several prostitutes were murdered. Nearly all of the murders have gone unpunished. It is estimated about one third of prostitutes here are underage. Bribes to officials to keep the industry running are estimated to be about US$450,000 a year.

One of the oldest and largest markets in the city, it is best known for its variety of fresh produce, meat, and seafood. The market is housed in a two-story building with a large central courtyard. The ground floor is devoted to produce, meat, and seafood, while the upper level has stalls selling kitchen utensils, dried fruit and nuts, herbs, and other food products. The market also has a separate section for fresh juices and cooked food. The market is a popular destination for both locals and tourists, and is known for its lively atmosphere and competitive prices. It is also a favorite spot for photographers and tourists interested in capturing images of traditional Mexican life. In recent years, the market has undergone several renovations to improve its infrastructure and cleanliness.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Compukit UK101"", the article should at least have 250 words","The Compukit UK101 microcomputer (1979) is a kit clone of the Ohio Scientific Superboard II single-board computer, with a few enhancements for the UK market - notably replacing the 24×24 (add guardband kit to give 32×32) screen display with a more useful 48×16 layout working at UK video frequencies. The video output is black and white with 256 characters generated by a two kilobyte ROM. It has no bit-mapped graphics capability. The video is output through a UHF modulator, designed to connect to a TV set.

History 
The UK101 design was published in Practical Electronics, a popular hobbyists magazine at the time. The August, September, October and November 1979 issues carried the four parts of the article, credited to ""Dr A. A. Berk"". Later issues of the magazine contained information on modifications and additions to the machine, including a series of articles on building an expansion unit.

Kits of parts for building the machine were available from CompShop Ltd of 14 Station Road, Barnet, Hertfordshire. It is thought that around 5000 kits were produced.

Description

Processor 
The Compukit UK101 is powered by a 6502 microprocessor CPU running at 1 MHz, and is equipped with up to 8 kilobytes of RAM using 2114 static RAM chips of 1024×4-bit. An additional memory-mapped 1 KB of RAM is used for the video display. It has the 8K Microsoft BASIC interpreter stored in ROM. In addition to Basic, a 6502 machine code monitor (2K bytes) is built into ROM. It allows programming by entering sequences of 6502 opcodes. Later a two-pass assembler was available which allows the use of assembly language.

Although the 6502 has two interrupt input pins (NMI and IRQ), neither is used by the UK101.

Display 
The UK101 has a 16-row, 48-column memory-mapped video display. All scrolling and character output functions are handled by firmware. In the original ROMs, the output functions were rudimentary and did not include a clear-screen function. CPU access to video memory causes noticeable glitches (known as ""snow"") on the screen.

Keyboard 
The keyboard of the UK101 is located on the main PCB, and comprises a matrix of keyswitches. The matrix is interfaced to the CPU via two 8-bit I/O ports, and is polled by firmware in the machine's ROMs. One key is a latching type, the shift-lock key. When supplied as a kit, the keyboard was assembled by the purchaser from a bag of switches and keytops.

The keyboard ports are located at address DF00 (hex), or 57088 (decimal). BASIC programs typically poll for real-time keyboard input by using the PEEK and POKE commands at that address. Because the keyboard lacks any way to generate an interrupt, it is not possible to implement a typeahead buffer. The keyboard matrix also lacks any diodes at the intersections of the matrix. This leads to problems when reading certain combinations of keys pressed simultaneously. The matrix was designed to allow only the shift, control and shift-lock keys to be pressed simultaneously with another key. The keyswitches themselves were originally manufactured by Cherry.

Program Storage 
In common with other home computers of the time, software can be saved and loaded on standard cassette tapes. The UK101 uses the Kansas City standard tape format. I/O is managed by a Motorola 6850 ACIA. This allows a full RS-232 port to be implemented, with the addition of a few extra components and minor modifications to existing jumpers on the board.

Compared to the Superboard 
Although very similar to the Ohio Scientific Superboard II, the Compukit UK101 differed from that machine in a few places:

1. Video display of the UK101 works at UK frequency and resolution. 

2. RF output is UHF, to suit domestic TVs in the UK. 

3. Power supply is located on the main PCB and accepts UK 240 V AC mains input (via a transformer). 

4. Display improved to 48 characters per line

5. Memory increased to 8 KB

However, similarities in the PCB layout make it clear that this machine is a clone. The people involved with the modifications were Chris Cary and Bill Wood.

Expansion 
The 40 pin expansion socket opened up the world to the UK101. One could attach a dual floppy disk controller (5.25"") and a memory expansion card (40K max) to allow faster and reliable save/load of programs/data.

A sound card became available, built around the General Instrument AY-3-8910, which together with a Peripheral Interface Adapter (PIA) WDC_65C21 chip, gave the UK101 audio abilities.

The UK101 floppy disk interface utilised a PIA to control the floppy disk drive stepper motor and another ACIA to serialise the data written to the disk.
A disk operating system was used to provide file storage capability but this resided in RAM and so reduced the available program space.
Typically single or double sided 40 track floppy drives could be supported.

The power consumption of an expanded UK101 could require up to 5Amps at 5.0Vdc (25Watts), so heat dissipation and power supply de-coupling were common challenges. Compare with a modern ARM microcontroller with similar capability at 0.5 Watts.

Previously, non-ceremonial transportation for the president was a 2011 Chevrolet Omega C, which was included in the presidential fleet and used by the president in some shifts. The car was even used in the parade of independence on September 7, 2016 and 2018, replacing the 1952 Rolls-Royce Silver Wraith (see below) traditionally used in the parade. Also, an armored 2011 Ford Fusion Hybrid, built on a Ford CD3 platform, was received. This vehicle replaced the 2008 Ford Fusion used previously, at which point the Ford Fusion was also included in the presidential motorcade.

In February 2012, the Brazilian government bought 12 Canadian-built Ford Edge models, 10 of which were armored, for the use of President Dilma Rousseff and her security team.

The state-provided vehicles of the federal government's most important officials (the president, ministers, magistrates, etc.) use green-and-yellow license plates (see below). Each plate is adorned with the coat of arms of Brazil and displays the official's title on it (such as President of the Republic, President of the Senate, Defense Minister, or Supreme Court President).

Ceremonial State Car

The ceremonial state car of Brazil is a 1952 Rolls-Royce Silver Wraith, which is used by the President of Brazil on special occasions like Independence Day commemorations, state visits, and the inauguration of the President-elect. This is one of the two Rolls-Royce models purchased by former President Getúlio Vargas in 1953.

Origins
When Getúlio Vargas became president in 1951, he had two Cadillacs as official state cars, dating from 1941 and 1947 respectively. Rolls-Royce was chosen to prepare four Silver Wraith models with special modifications for security, with the intention to purchase two examples. Vargas received the first hardtop model on 31 January 1953. The first foreign head of state to use it was General Manuel Odria, President of Peru.

The government paid £5,831 for the hardtop model and £7,540 for the second Silver Wraith, a cabriolet. The cars were paid for by wealthy friends as a present to Vargas himself, on condition that he would donate them to the presidency at the end of his term in office.

With political problems, Vargas shot himself in the chest on 24 August 1954 and, with his suicide, the handover did not happen. The cars became part of the President's estate and were claimed by his family. The solution only came in 1957, although the cars had still been used by President Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira in the interim. The family took the hardtop Rolls-Royce and gave the cabriolet to the presidency. The last official service of the hardtop model was for the personal transportation of Berta Craveiro Lopes, wife of Portuguese president General Craveiro Lopes.

Queen Elizabeth II
It had been claimed that the convertible model was a gift from Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, but this is not the case, although she did use the car during a 1968 state visit to Brazil.

Nowadays
The car can be seen in state ceremonies that take place on the first Sunday of each month at the Planalto Palace and in the streets around it. Sometimes, the car is also used for the rehearsal of state ceremonies and parades. Its speed limit is 80 km/h, but it is rarely seen to travel faster than 20 km/h.

The daily transportation of the President is made by modern vehicles, with the Rolls-Royce reserved exclusively for ceremonial occasions. In 2001, the Rolls-Royce was sent for restoration by President Fernando Henrique Cardoso after 48 years of service.

Vehicles of Brazil"," Presidential State Car (Brazil) The Presidential State Car is the vehicle used by the President of Brazil to transport the head of state on official occasions. Its use is regulated by the Constitution of Brazil and other laws. The car is a Ford Lincoln Continental, built in the United States. The car was modified by Ford do Brasil, in São Paulo, to meet the demands of the Brazilian government, and was delivered on December 17, 2013, at the planalto, the official residence of the President of Brazil. The car was used for the first time on January 1, 2014, during the inauguration ceremony of the new President, Dilma Rousseff. According to the Brazilian Constitution, the color of the car is black and the license plate is 1-X-1. The car has two flags, one on each side, the Brazilian national flag and the flag of the Republic of Brazil. The words ""República Federativa do Brasil"" (Federal Republic of Brazil) are written on the back of the car in gold letters. The car also has special tires that can resist a missile attack. The car is used for official ceremonies, like the Opening of the Congress, or to transport the President to official business. The President is required to use the car for trips to and from the Presidential Palace, as well as for official trips to other states. The car is always accompanied by two motorbikes for security. The car was designed by President Lula da Silva, and built by a team of technicians from the Presidential Palace, the Secret Service, and the Ford company. The design of the car was approved in October 2012, and the construction was completed in December 2013. The previous car, a Mercedes-Benz S-Class, was used by President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, and was retired in January 2014. The car was offered to the Brazilian Mint, to be exhibited in the National Museum, but the offer was refused because of the high cost of maintaining the car.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Polyhedral map projection"", the article should at least have 250 words","A polyhedral map projection is a map projection based on a spherical polyhedron. Typically, the polyhedron is overlaid on the globe, and each face of the polyhedron is transformed to a polygon or other shape in the plane. The best-known polyhedral map projection is Buckminster Fuller's Dymaxion map. When the spherical polyhedron faces are transformed to the faces of an ordinary polyhedron instead of laid flat in a plane, the result is a polyhedral globe.

Often the polyhedron used is a Platonic solid or Archimedean solid. However, other polyhedra can be used: the AuthaGraph projection makes use of a polyhedron with 96 faces, and the myriahedral projection allows for an arbitrary large number of faces.
Although interruptions between faces are common, and more common with an increasing number of faces, some maps avoid them: the Lee conformal projection only has interruptions at its border, and the AuthaGraph projection scales its faces so that the map fills a rectangle without internal interruptions. Some projections can be tesselated to fill the plane, the Lee conformal projection among them.

To a degree, the polyhedron and the projection used to transform each face of the polyhedron can be considered separately, and some projections can be applied to differently shaped faces. The gnomonic projection transforms the edges of spherical polyhedra to straight lines, preserving all polyhedra contained within a hemisphere, so it is a common choice. The Snyder equal-area projection can be applied to any polyhedron with regular faces. The projection used in later versions of the Dymaxion map can be generalized to other equilateral triangular faces, and even to certain quadrilaterals.

Polyhedral map projections are useful for creating discrete global grids, as with the quadrilateralized spherical cube and Icosahedral Snyder Equal Area (ISEA) grids.

History 
The earliest known polyhedral projection is the octant projection developed by Leonardo da Vinci or his associate around 1514, which transforms the faces of an octahedron to Reuleaux triangles.

Christian Gottlieb Reichard created a polyhedral globe based on the cube in 1803. An icosahedral globe appeared in 1851. Polyhedral globes cheaply constructed from cardboard were popular for a time in Europe.

Projections based on dihedra begin appearing with the Peirce quincuncial projection in 1879, Guyou hemisphere-in-a-square projection in 1887, and Adams hemisphere-in-a-square projection in 1925. Although the dihedra are not traditional polyhedra they are spherical polyhedra, and the methods used in these projections are also used in other polyhedral projections. In the same work as the hemisphere-in-a-square projection, Adams created maps depicting the entire globe in a rhombus, hexagon, and hexagram.

Bernard J. S. Cahill invented the ""butterfly map"", based on the octahedron, in 1909. This was generalized into the Cahill–Keyes projection in 1975 and the Waterman butterfly projection in 1996. Cahill's work was also influential on Fuller's Dymaxion maps: his first version, based on a cuboctahedron, was published in 1943, and his second, based on an icosahedron, was published in 1954.

The quadrilateralized spherical cube was devised in 1975 for the Cosmic Background Explorer project.

Map projections"," A polyhedral map projection is a map projection that is formed by projecting the surface of the Earth onto the faces of a polyhedron. Such projections are known for the complete sets of faces of the regular Platonic solids, the regular Archimedean solids, and the rhombohedra. The idea of projecting the globe onto the faces of a polyhedron was first explored by the German geographer and cartographer Johann Georg Trumphaus in 1704. He produced a series of globes with a cube projection, with the six faces of the cube divided into three equal rows of three squares each. The top and bottom rows of squares were parallel to the equator and the middle row was parallel to the central meridian. The four corners of the cube were bisected by the four main meridians and the four main parallels. The first projection of the globe onto the faces of a regular polyhedron was by the French geographer and cartographer Jean Baptiste Bourguignon d'Anville around 1754. He produced a series of globes with a projection onto the six faces of a regular dodecahedron. This is the most common of the polyhedral projections, known as the Dymaxion projection. The name Dymaxion was derived by the British engineer and inventor R. Buckminster Fuller in the 20th century. The Dymaxion projection has the advantage that distances on the globe are proportional to distances on the projected surface. The more well known effect is that the continents are mapped as nearly rectilinear. Fuller also noted other properties of the Dymaxion projection. For example, the continents are mapped as a single connected land mass, without the interruptions of the oceans. The Dymaxion projection is a ""conformal"" projection, meaning that it preserves the angles between lines. For this reason, the Dymaxion projection is used in some areas of geometry and in some areas of cartography, for example, in the determination of flight paths. The polyhedral projections have been the subject of some debate among cartographers. Some have praised the beauty and simplicity of the shapes of the continents in these projections, while others have criticized the projections for being ""too regular"" and lacking the character of the more common projections, such as the Mercator projection. In the early 20th century, when the Dymaxion projection was first used for world maps, some cartographers also criticized the projection for being ""too small"" for showing the relative sizes of the continents. The Dymaxion projection is not the only polyhedral projection with these properties. There are also projections onto the faces of the regular octahedron and the regular icosahedron that are conformal. These projections are known as the octahedral projection and the icosahedral projection. The polyhedral projections are examples of non-perspectival projections.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,69388599,0.05842259006815968,0.21052631578947367,0.1599356428585976,0.45482866043613707,1,3,0,0,2,0,1,0,0,1,0.15128869604293468,0.025316647762519025,0.002899751449875725,0.033169533169533166,4,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,6,1,11,1,1,1

The population of the ward at the 2011 census was 12,199.  However the area dates back to the West Derby hundred district from the 12th century. The area forms part of St Helens town centre.

History
In the mid 14th century, the manor of Parr was held by William Dacre, 2nd Baron Dacre.

Parr was one of four townships that joined together, for administrative purposes, to become St. Helens, the others being Sutton, Eccleston and Windle.

The Sankey Canal, also known as the Sankey Brook Navigation and St Helens Canal, flows through Parr. When opened in 1757, it ran from close to the mouth of Sankey Brook at the River Mersey along the valley of the Sankey Brook, ending north east of St Helens. Later extensions were made at the Mersey end, firstly to Fiddlers Ferry, then to Widnes, and at the northern end, where it was extended into what became the centre of St Helens.

St Peter's Church was built in 1864-65 to the designs of J. Medland Taylor: the stonework is in three different colours and there is a broach spire.

The area was overlooked by Bold Power Station across ""The Moss"" until the decommissioned station was demolished in the late 90s.

Parr has a historical link to the Parr family, most famously represented by Henry VIII's final wife Catherine Parr.  Her father Sir Thomas Parr is known to have owned or rented lands in the area.  The family seat was Parr Hall, sited in the Redgate area close to where Frodsham Drive is today.

Housing
The area of Parr is predominately social housing, represented by three main stages of developments.  Waring Avenue Estate (developed 1950s / 60s), Concourse Way (colloquially referred to as Cement City in reference to its Pebble Dash rendering) developed in the 1960s, The Pennine Drive Estate developed in the 1950s.  Amidst these estates remain the more traditional buildings dating to the 1930s, along with Terrace Housing (1890s onwards) and private developments.

The area succumbed to social problems linked to poverty and an aging population during the 1980s with the collapse of several significant employers in St. Helens.  Its housing remains markedly cheaper than other areas of St. Helens due to a commonly perceived stigma of high crime and low education standards.

Since 2006 the area, as well as other areas of St. Helens in coordination with Re:new Neighbourhood Management Project, has been targeted for regeneration. Parr was selected for the Pilot scheme and has seen increased funding to local parks and green spaces (The Duckeries for instance, formerly a slag heap, is now in the process of returning the land to its marshy origins, whilst new multi-sporting facilities and park equipment have been added to Gaskell Park and others).

In coordination with Helena Housing many council and private properties have been refurbished with new exterior walls, adding a new roof to each property, UPVC doors and double glazing.  Other projects have included a government incentive schemes for loft insulation, cavity insulation and secure gated schemes for alley access.

Recently a new private housing development of detached houses, terraced homes, and flats was completed along Newton Road and adjacent to the Derbyshire Hill area, with more new-builds developed on Ashtons Green Drive, and Fleet Lane.

Transport
Parr has three main access routes. The A572 (Newton Road) linking to Newton-le-Willows, the A572 (Parr Stocks Road), a direct route into St Helens town centre and the B5204 towards Burtonwood, Warrington.

Education
There are currently no non-denominational high schools located in Parr, since the closure of Parr High School. St. Cuthbert's is the only secondary establishment, resting on the junction of Watery Lane and Berry's Lane and the boundary of Sutton (their official address is in fact ""Sutton""). St. Augustine's is located in nearby Blackbrook.

After Parr High School closed, many students attend Outwood Academy Haydock.

Sport
There are no professional sporting clubs or organisations in Parr.  The area boasts a series of playing fields where the local combination football league and rugby fixtures are played as well.  One of St. Helens' swimming baths is also located in the area.

Blackbrook A.R.L.F.C. is situated in the Blackbrook area of Parr.

Notable people
The wealthy entrepreneur John Rylands was born in Parr in 1801. Martin Murray also grew up in the area.

It is located to the west of St Helens on the A580 (East Lancashire Road), close to the M62 motorway. Historically a part of Lancashire, Parr was recorded as Parro in the 13th century and the name may have originated from the Old English word for ""pear tree"". The village has a small shopping area with a number of shops, including a Co-op, a newsagent, a barbers, a chemist and a takeaway. There is also a greengrocer, a florist and a car dealer. The village has three pubs.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Araucaria rulei"", the article should at least have 250 words","Araucaria rulei (Rule araucaria, graceful pine) is a species of conifer in the family Araucariaceae. It is endemic to New Caledonia, where it is an endangered species. Its populations are fragmented and are generally made up of scattered individuals. It is restricted to serpentine soils, often with high nickel levels, and its natural range is almost completely restricted to areas rich in nickel. Nickel mining in New Caledonia has consequently been a major cause of its decline.

Araucaria rulei grows to around 30 meters in height, with long slender branches arranged symmetrically around the trunk, which extend horizontally and then turn upwards and branch out at the end, giving the tree an appearance sometimes compared to a chandelier. Male and female cones are produced on the same tree but on different branches, with branches at the top of the tree tending to produce female cones, while branches lower down make male cones. The cones stay on the tree for 2–3 years while the seeds ripen, which are around 3 cm long when mature. It is a slow-growing plant with slow regeneration capabilities, though in its natural environment it is tolerant of both very dry conditions and high winds which many other species of araucaria will not tolerate. The species was named for an Australian nurseryman John Rule, and is sometimes grown as an ornamental tree in Australia, with its large smooth leaves and the symmetrical dome shaped growth habit of mature trees considered attractive.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""José R. Oliva"", the article should at least have 250 words","José R. Oliva (born January 6, 1973) is an American Republican politician from Florida. He served in the  Florida House of Representatives, representing the Hialeah and Miami Lakes area in northern Miami-Dade County from 2011 to 2020. He was speaker of the House during his last term in office from 2018 to 2020.

History
Oliva was born in Elizabeth, New Jersey, and moved to the state of Florida in 1974. He graduated from Hialeah-Miami Lakes High School, and later attended St. Thomas University, but did not graduate. Oliva founded a cigar manufacturing business with his brothers, and eventually served as its chief executive officer. From 2001 to 2005, he served as a Hialeah housing commissioner.

Florida House of Representatives
When incumbent state representative Esteban Bovo resigned from the legislature to successfully run for the Miami-Dade County Commission in 2011, a special election was called to replace him. Oliva ran in the Republican primary against Frank Lago and Rafael Luiz Perez, emphasizing his support for ""lower taxes, small and accountable government, [and] conservative family values."" He ended up winning the primary, receiving 42% of the vote to Lago's 35% and Perez's 23%, and advanced to the general election, where he only faced write-in opposition. Oliva won the general election handily, winning 93% of the vote.

In 2012, following the reconfiguration of the legislative districts, Oliva remained in the 110th District, which retained most of the territory that he had previously represented. He was challenged in the Republican primary by Ileana Abay, but he dispatched her easily, winning renomination with 86% of the vote. In the general election, he once again only faced write-in opposition, and he won his second term with nearly 100% of the vote.

Following his re-election, Oliva received enough votes from his colleagues in the legislature to assume the position of Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives for the 2018–20 legislative session.

Oliva was term-limited from the House in 2020, after serving a partial term and four full terms.

In February 2019, Oliva referred to pregnant women as a ""host body"" a total of five times during an interview with CBS4's Jim DeFede in Miami. In response, state representative Anna Eskamani stated, ""With all due respect Mr. Speaker, my body is not a ""host"" and personal medical decisions around my pregnancy belong to me, my family, my doctor, and my faith— not to politicians."" Oliva apologized for the term, stating, ""It was an attempt to use terminology found in medical ethics writings with the purpose of keeping the discussion dispassionate. The reaction undoubtedly shows it had the exact opposite effect. I apologize for having caused offense, my aim was the contrary.""

w154 meridian west"," 154th meridian west The 154th meridian west is a line of longitude that extends from the western boundary of the Soviet Union in Europe to the Pacific Ocean and passes through the North American states of Montana and Wyoming. The meridian is the boundary between two time zones: UTC+2 and UTC−7. The 154th meridian west forms the western boundary of the Soviet Union, running across Russia's Far Eastern Federal District. The boundary continues south of the 54°N 130°W to the 60°N 130°W, where it turns eastwards to the 65°N 130°W, then again turns to the south to the 55°N 140°W. The boundary then follows the 55°N 140°W to the 50°N 140°W, where it turns to the south-west to the 45°N 140°W, then to the south to the 40°N 140°W, and finally to the south-east to the 37°N 142°W, where it terminates in the Pacific Ocean. The 154th meridian west is also the boundary between two North American time zones. The northern part of the meridian is in the Mountain Time Zone, while the southern part is in the Pacific Time Zone. The boundary between the two time zones is located at the 110°W, where the meridian crosses the 37th parallel north.

It was formally described in 1996, having previously been identified as belonging to the related species H. italica.

Description
Hyacinthoides paivae is a perennial plant which grows from bulbs that are typically  × . Each bulb produces 4–7 (more rarely 2–12) basal leaves, each  long and  wide. The stems are  long, and bear an inflorescence comprising 6–18 flowers in a multilateral raceme. Each flower is attached by a pedicel  long, and is itself  long by  wide. H. paivae can be told apart from H. italica by its broader leaves and larger flowers; H. hispanica differs in having longer, narrower, unscented and bell-shaped flowers.

Distribution and ecology
Hyacinthoides paivae is endemic to the north-western part of the Iberian Peninsula, including western parts of Galicia (A Coruña, Ourense and Pontevedra provinces) and north-western parts of Portugal (Beira Litoral, Douro Litoral, Minho and Trás-os-Montes provinces). Material of an unidentified species from the Sierra de la Demanda, a small mountain range on the border between Burgos province and La Rioja, matches H. paivae genetically.

H. paivae occurs in oak woodland and pine woods growing over Ulex, Erica cinerea and Cistus spp., as well as other shady habitats. It also occurs occasionally on coastal cliffs, and in mown meadows. The typical flowering period is March and April, although it can be as late as June in upland areas, such as Monte Pindo.

Taxonomic history
In 1990, bluebells assigned to the species Hyacinthoides italica were reported from north-western Spain. Later analyses of the species morphology demonstrated that the plants did not belong to H. italica, which is only otherwise found near the French–Italian border. Instead, it was realised that they represented a new species, which was named Hyacinthoides paivae by Santiago Ortiz and Juan Rodríguez-Oubiña in 1996, the specific epithet  honouring the Portuguese botanist Jorge Paiva.

The holotype, a specimen from Dumbría, A Coruña province, Spain, is held at the herbarium of the ; isotypes are also kept there, and at the University of Coimbra, the  and  in Madrid, the  in Pontevedra, and at the Natural History Museum and Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in London.

Ortiz and Rodríguez-Oubiña initially placed the species in ""Hyacinthoides sect. Somera"", but more recent molecular phylogenetic analysis could not confirm any of the existing sections in the genus, and placed it instead in an informal group alongside H. non-scripta, H. hispanica and H. cedretorum.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Apologeticus"", the article should at least have 250 words","Apologeticus ( or Apologeticus) is a text attributed to Tertullian, consisting of apologetic and polemic. In this work Tertullian defends Christianity, demanding legal toleration and that Christians be treated as all other sects of the Roman Empire. It is in this treatise that one finds the sentence ""Plures efficimur, quotiens metimur a vobis: semen est sanguis Christianorum."" which has been liberally and apocryphally translated as ""the blood of the martyrs is the seed of the Church"" (Apologeticus, L.13). Alexander Souter translated this phrase as ""We spring up in greater numbers the more we are mown down by you: the blood of the Christians is the seed of a new life,"" but even this takes liberties with the original text. ""We multiply when you reap us. The blood of Christians is seed,"" is perhaps a more faithful, if less poetic, rendering. 

There is a similarity of content, if not of purpose, between this work and Tertullian's Ad nationes—published earlier in the same year—and it has been claimed that the latter is a finished draft of Apologeticus. There arises also the question of similarity to Minucius Felix's dialogue Octavius. Some paragraphs are shared by both texts; it is not known which predated the other.

Tertullian's brief De testimonio animae (""Concerning the Evidences of the Soul"") is an appendix to the Apologeticus, intended to illustrate the meaning of the phrase testimonium animae naturaliter christianae in chapter  17).

Authorship
Not much is known about the life of Quintus Septimus Florens Tertullian. Some scholars believe him to have been a presbyter (priest) of the Christian Church, the son of a Roman centurion, and have him training to be a lawyer in Rome. Others, like David Wright, find that to be highly improbable. ""No firm evidence places him in Rome at all, or for that matter anywhere outside of Carthage… It is in the well-educated circles in Carthage,"" Wright argues, ""that Tertullian most securely belongs"". Sometime after his conversion to the Christian faith, Tertullian left the Catholic Church in favor of the Montanist movement, which he remained a part of for at least 10–15 years of his active life and whose influence can be seen in many of his later works.

Ascribed date
Apologeticus, his most famous apologetic work, was written in Carthage in the summer or autumn of AD 197, during the reign of :Septimius Severus. Using this date, most scholars agree that Tertullian's conversion to Christianity occurred sometime before 197, possibly around 195. It was written before the edict of Septimius Severus (AD 202), and consequently, the laws to which Tertullian took exception were those under which the Christians of the 1st and 2nd centuries had been convicted.

Oldest extant manuscripts
""The present treatise depends on three authorities, none of them comprising the entire work. The first printed edition, by Martin Mesnart at Paris in 1545, containing chapters 1-19, was made from a manuscript now lost, but which seems to have been a copy of the already mutilated original of the eleventh-century codex Agobardinus (now at Paris). This, our oldest extant authority, contains a number of Tertullian's works, and of the present treatise chapters 1-30; in the first sentence of chapter 21 the copyist, following his original, which had lost a number of pages, passed on (without apparently noticing any discrepancy) to the middle of a sentence near the beginning of a different work On The Dress of Women.""

""The study of the manuscripts of Tert. has established that in the Middle Ages several collection of works of this author were in existence1:
1. The collection of the Codex Agobardinus, the oldest extant manuscript of Tert.2.
2. The collection of the manuscript of Troyes 523 (Codex Trecensis) of the twelfth century3.
3. A collection represented by a number of manuscripts, which derive from a lost Codex Cluniacensis and a likewise lost manuscript from Hirsau (Württemberg), the Hirsaugiensis4.

Addressees and audience
This work is ostensibly addressed to the provincial governors of the Roman Empire, more specifically the magistrates of Carthage- ""that the truth, being forbidden to defend itself publicly, may reach the ears of the rulers by the hidden path of letters""— and thus bears resemblance to the Greek apologues. It is structured as an appeal on behalf of the Christians and pleads ""for toleration of Christianity, attacking pagan superstition, rebutting charges against Christian morality, and claiming that Christians are no danger to the State but useful citizens"". Its readership is likely to have been composed of Christians, whose faith was reinforced through Tertullian's defense against rationalizations and rumours and who  ""would have been hugely enheartened by Tertullian’s matchless confidence in the superiority of the Christian religion"".

Genre
Apologeticus has the typical concerns of other apologetic works of his time, though it is presented in a much more complex manner. According to Wright, the text is constantly shifting ""from the philosophical mode to the rhetorical and even juridical"". Drawing from his training in literature and law, Tertullian demonstrates his talents as a Latinist and a rhetorician in an attempt to defend his newfound Christian faith. Tertullian's modern editor :Otto Bardenhewer further contends that Apologeticus is calm in tone, ""a model of judicial discussion"". Unlike previous apologists of Christianity, whose appeals for tolerance were made in the name of reason and humanity, Tertullian, influenced by his legal training, spoke as a jurist convinced of the injustice of the laws under which the Christians were persecuted.

Summary of Apologeticus
The following outline and summary is based on Robert D. Sider's translation of Apologeticus.

Introduction and addressing of unjust treatment of the Christians (Chapters 1–6)
The first section of Apology is concerned with the unjust treatment of the Christians, which Tertullian believes stems from the ignorance of the pagan populace. Simply put, he argues that people praise what they know and hate what they do not. To Tertullian this becomes evident in the cases of people who once hated because they were ignorant towards that they hated, and once their ignorance was gone, so was their hate. Their hatred prevents them from investigating more closely and acknowledging the goodness that is inherent in Christianity, and so they remain ignorant. And there is good in Christianity, Tertullian claims, despite the fact that people remain ignorant to it. Even when brought forth and accused, true Christians do not tremble with fear or deny their faith. It is the authorities that display bad behavior when they deny proper criminal treatment to the Christians. He argues that if Christians are to be treated as criminals, they should not be treated differently from ordinary criminals, who are free to answer to charges, to cross-question and defend themselves. In reality, the Christians are not free to say anything that will clear their name or ensure that the judge conducts a fair trial. If an individual says he is not a Christian, he is tortured until he says he is; if he admits to being a Christian, the authorities want to hear that he is not and torture him until he denies it. They resort to any means necessary to force them to either deny or confess, anything to acquit him. If all this done to someone simply for admitting to be a Christian, then they are surely making a mockery of Roman laws by basing all the charges on the name ""Christian"". Before hating the name, one must look at and study the founder and the school.

In addressing the charges, Tertullian plans to show the hypocrisy that surrounds these charges, demonstrating that those crimes exist among the pagan prosecutors as well. Then he analyzes the laws, claiming it suspicious that a law should refuse to be examined for error and worthless if it demands obedience without examination. If a law is found having an error and being unjust, should it not be reformed or even condemned? Faulty laws have no place in a just judicial system and should thus not be applied and observed. Here Tertullian mentions :Nero, and to a certain extent :Domitian, as examples of emperors who raged against the Christians through the use of unjust laws, simply for condemning ""some magnificent good"". He then brings up the good laws, and asks what has become of them; those that ""restrained extravagance and bribery"", ""protected their [women's] modesty and sobriety"", of the ""conjugal happiness so fostered by high moral living that for nearly six hundred years after Rome was founded no sued for divorce"". These traditions and laws are being ignored, neglected and destroyed and yet Rome chooses to concern itself with the ""crimes"" committed by the Christians.

Charges based on rumor answered (Chapters 7–9)
Tertullian begins by addressing the charges based on rumors, charges that vary from murdering and eating babies to committing incestuous and adulterous acts. Ultimately, he argues, they are simply rumors, for no evidence has ever been brought forth. No one has ever seen believers gather and supposedly commit impure acts or heard the cry of a crying baby because meetings and rituals are rarely performed in front of non-believers. It's all just lies and rumors meant to slander the Christian faith. Tertullian then makes the claim that Romans themselves are guilty of the very crimes it claims the Christians do. People from every age are sacrificed to Saturn and Jupiter all throughout the empire. The arenas are filled with the blood of those that fight, and the Romans even consume the animals that eat the bloodied bodies of the dead. For the Christians, murder is strictly forbidden; there is to be no killing or spilling of human blood, and that includes the killing the baby in the womb, for it would be destroying its soul. Neither are Christians allowed to eat meat that still has blood. 

Of the charges of incest and adultery, Tertullian says that Christians are not guilty of them, for they refrain from adultery and from fornicating before marriage, thus ensuring that they are safe from incest. Such behavior is different from that of the Romans, who through their immoral acts commit incest. This comes about simply through the case of mistaken identity: men go off and commit adultery, begetting children all throughout the empire who later unknowingly have intercourse with their own kin by mistake. In his attempt to make the Romans acknowledge their engagement in these acts, Tertullian hopes to demonstrate that Christians behave much differently from what they are accused of and that the charges should not hold.

Charges of more ""manifest crimes"" answered (Chapters 10–45)

Of the more ""manifest crimes"", as Tertullian refers to them, he first addresses the charges of sacrilege and says that Christians do not worship the pagan gods because the gods are not real, do not exist and thus hold no power or control over anything. Saturn, he claims, was once a mere man, as Roman lore and history will demonstrate. He then refutes further claims that the gods received their divinity through death, and wonders what business would the gods have with wanting ministers and assistants that are already dead. Such powerless beings cannot even be responsible for the rise and success of the Roman Empire. Furthermore, the character and nature of the gods themselves leave much to be desired; they are filled with rage, incestuous thoughts, envy, and jealousy. Why then should such imperfect and wicked beings be worthy of praise? He makes an even greater argument in referring to the pagan gods as demons, whose sole purpose is the subversion and destruction of mankind. They corrupt the souls of men by passions and lusts and rather successfully procuring ""for themselves a proper diet of fumes and blood offered to their statues' images."" In this way they draw attention to themselves and prevent people from turning to the true God. But even the demons acknowledge the power of God, and acknowledging this should be enough to clear the Christians of charges of sacrilege. For Tertullian, the Romans are at fault here for worshipping the wrong religion, not that of the one true God. But if the gods are real, and if the Christians are guilty of sacrilege, what does that say about Rome? The people all worship different gods and often treat their images with less respect than they deserve, using any opportunity to pawn their statues off and use them as sources of income. Tertullian further criticizes their literature, practices and ceremonies, calling them absurd and criticizing their philosophers’ disgraceful actions. Socrates would swear by dogs and Diogenes and Varro made less than respectful comments concerning the deities. The plays constantly make jokes about and mockery of the gods. Surely, he argues, the plays and the masks must be disrespectful to the gods. It is the Romans then that are guilty of sacrilege and impiety. 

Christians do not venerate these false and dead gods, nor do they treat them in such a casual and careless manner. They worship the One God, the Creator of the universe. Unlike the pagan gods, He is real and His very existence is proven by the testimony of the soul, which cries out ""God"" despite its weakened and fallen state. His works and the works of his prophets are preserved from Moses, who was 1000 years before the Trojan War and predates both Saturn and much of ancient Roman literature tradition, to many others key biblical figures. Tertullian goes on to briefly discuss the revelation of God through Christ. In order to do that, he speaks of the relationship between the Jewish people and God; they once enjoyed much favor from God but became ""so filled with presumptuous confidence in their ancestors that they strayed from their teaching into manners of the world"". Christ comes to re-establish the true doctrine; He is embodiment of Word and Reason, having been brought forth by God and thus having the title of Son of God. He adds, ""his ray of God, then, was ever foretold in the past descended into a certain virgin and, formed as flesh in her womb, and was born man mingled (later changed to ‘united’) with God"". Having given an explanation of the nature and divinity of Christ, Tertullian shifts to the charges of treason.  

To the charges that Christians do not offer sacrifice to Caesar, Tertullian says that it is practically useless to do that, for it is not in their power to give Caesar health, wealth and power. What they can offer to him they do through the use of prayer, because only God has absolute power and from him comes the emperor. He alone brings up empires and takes them down and only he is responsible for granting Caesar power, health and wealth; ""We ask for them [emperors] a long life, undisturbed power, security at home, brave armies, a faithful Senate, an upright people, a peaceful world, and everything for which a man or a Caesar prays"". Tertullian affirms that by praying for him, Christians are effectively putting Roman interests in God's hands as well as commending Caesar to God. In no way do their meetings endanger the state, nor do they involve plotting against the emperor, the senate, or the empire. Their treatment of the Roman Empire exhibits the same respect and well wishes that they display upon to their neighbor. Any other behavior would not be the sign of a good Christian.

Tertullian has addressed the charges and demonstrated that the charges faced by Christians are based on lies and rumors and that no such things have been committed. After all he has demonstrated, Tertullian marvels at how the pagan prosecutors still claim that being a Christian is a crime against the empire. Christianity in general presents no threat to public order and thus its members should be allowed to meet and live in peace.

Portrait of Christian society and of philosophy (Chapters 39–47)
Tertullian then proceeds to give an explanation of Christian life and practices. He describes the manner in which they come together to worship and please God; to pray for each other as well as for the emperor and the empire, to study and consider the Holy Scriptures, and to share food—but not before offering prayers and thanks to God. Afterwards everyone is free to share a song or something they learned from scripture, praising God all throughout the night. He continues by explaining the practice of tithing, the concept of loving one another and of being brothers and sisters, being united by their way of life under the teachings of Christ. And being part of this world, Christians have to interact with it and with others. They shop at meat markets and local shops, go to the baths and stay at inns just like everyone else, though in everything they do, they ""bear in mind that we owe thanks to the Lord our God who created us"". Despite this, the persecutors and accusers fail to recognize innocence when they see it, persecuting and treating the Christians unjustly. Christians know true innocence because they have learned and inherited it from God; they recognize and understand the eternal punishment that exists apart from God and acknowledge and fear the one who passes that real and true Judgment. Tertullian declares, ""in a word, we fear God, not the proconsul"". He also addresses the claim that Christianity is more than a philosophy, bringing up the philosophers that say, ""it [Christianity] teaches the virtues and profess morality, justice, patience, moderation, and chastity"". He makes the case that if Christianity is just another kind of philosophy, it should be treated the same way, granted with the freedom to teach and spread their beliefs and practice, customs and rituals.

Concluding considerations and remarks
Tertullian concludes his apology by likening the struggle of the Christians to a man fighting a battle. The Christians take no pleasure in being persecuted and enduring trials, but as soldiers of Christ they too must fight for the truth, all, of course, for the glory of God. Addressing the magistrates, he says ""Crucify us- torture us- condemn us- destroy us! Your injustice is the proof of our innocence... When we are condemned by you, we are acquitted by God"".

Apologetics
2nd-century Christian texts"," Apologeticus In Roman Catholic theology, apologetics is an area of the Christian tradition that deals with the defense of the Catholic faith. In Greek, the word apologeticus (ἀπολογικός) means ""speaking in defense"". The term apology in this context is not an admission of wrongdoing, but rather a defense of the faith. Apologetics includes the defense of the Catholic Church against scandals, the promotion of the Catholic faith through the explanation of church teachings and traditions, and the refutation of objections to Catholic teachings. It is an important topic for the Catholic Church, particularly in the face of a secularized culture. The Catholic Church's approach to apologetics is unique. While it makes use of reason, it does not rely upon it absolutely. Catholic apologetics is not an attempt to win an argument, but to win a soul. Thus, Catholic apologetics is more about love than about logic. The Church's approach to apologetics is to convince people of the love that God has for them, and the extent to which the Catholic Church wants to lead them to that love. In the modern world, the term apologetics has come to refer more to the use of reason to convince someone of the faith, rather than to the use of love. This is an unfortunate narrowing of the term's meaning, which has been further confused by the use of the term apologetics to refer to the defense of the faith against those who attack it. In this context, apologetics is not about love, but about winning an argument. This is not the meaning that the Church gives to the term apologetics. In the Catholic Church, the term apologetics is used to refer to the use of reason to explain and promote the faith. This is a very different use of the term apologetics than is generally used in the modern world.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,721235,0.22315986872948898,0.1368421052631579,0.4831877151178184,0.2336448598130841,13,9,0,2,11,1,0,0,0,1,0.3240800888019091,0.025408128027379795,0.007180336923501795,0.022113022113022112,20,1,36,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,13,0,27,1,1,1

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Ra-Ra Zoo"", the article should at least have 250 words","Ra-Ra Zoo was an English-based new circus theatre company, active (August 1984 - September 1994), a seminal group who created self devised physical theatre performance for theatres using comedy and circus skills. Founded by Sue Broadway, Stephen Kent, David Spathaky and Sue Bradley while they were all working and staying together at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in August 1984.

In 2018, the UK Guardian newspaper named them as one of the 25 most influential aspects of the 250 year history of circus in the West.

The first public performance was at the infamous Tunnel Club hosted by Malcolm Hardee in the East End of London. Notably, the normally vocal audience were unusually silenced by a wordless version of their signature teacup act.

Their first full show at the Battersea Arts Centre was as part of the London International Mime Festival in January 1985, their first theatre show, sub-titled, ""Juggling With A Social Conscience"".

They subsequently toured internationally for ten years playing in theatres notable to Africa, South America, Australia and extensively in Europe. Their show under the joint Artistic Direction of David Spathaky and Sue Broadway combined the ethos of 'alternative' comedy of the 1980 with a 1970s revival of circus skills, variously called 'Neo-circus or new variety by them or New Circus' by other people, it largely promoted a reinvention of circus focusing on human skill and generally without presenting animal acts. Their background in street performing, The Amazing Mendezies and in the influential Circus Oz (of which Sue Broadway was a founding member) gave the show an irreverent, fast-paced, surrealist feel.

Productions 

They produced several different shows and were occasionally given some financial support in the UK by the Arts Council and other grants. They also produced several large scale community shows, were touring two shows at the same time in the early 1990s and created jobs for more than twenty five people simultaneously during production periods.

They notably adhered to a political commitment of a balance of men and women on stage and off and of equal pay for all company members throughout their existence.

Shows included:

Juggling With A Social Conscience.
My Life on a Plate of Toast — Several versions - chamber circus 4 people on stage
Domestic Bliss - a touring seven person theatre circus show
Stop Laughing This Is Serious - touring 7 person theatre circus show
Fabulous Beasts - touring seven person theatre circus show
Gravity Swing- touring seven person theatre circus show
Angels and Amazons - all woman 3 person clown show
Swan - a community circus
White Snake - A large scale community circus opera (50 performers) combining professional and non professional performers, trainers from China, original libretto and commissioned music.
Cabinet of Curiosities - A 'chamber circus' - 4 people on stage
Broadway Belles - All women cabaret show
The Mast - a site specific outdoor aerial rig at the Albany Empire in Deptford and the Henley Regatta.
The Plymouth Theatre Royal Cleaners - a commissioned intervention at a patrons end of season party.

Influence 
Ra-Ra Zoo was influenced by the agitprop and political theatre of the late 1960s and early 70's and the ritual theatre and 'Happenings' associated with the time notably the 'Grand Magic Circus', 'Circus Oz, 'The People Show', 'Cunning Stunts, 'The Festival of Fools' in Amsterdam and the German choreographer Pina Bausch. Political influence came from the 1970s wave of the feminist movement and direct action politics such as the protests at Greenham Common in the UK and the resurgence of 'theatre' as political activism.

Ra-Ra Zoo influenced in turn many others as the company employed over a hundred people during its existence and played to many thousands of people worldwide. They spawned and encouraged, directly and indirectly, many offshoots including The Circus Space, (now NCCA) The Gandini Juggling Project, The Flying Gorillas, No Ordinary Angels, Le La Les, Broadway and Co., and Stretch People.

Founder Sue Broadway  returned to lead Circus Oz  as Artistic Director and helped direct the circus elements of the Sydney Olympics opening ceremony.

Founder Dave Spathaky was in semi retirement from 1994 but after surgery in 2008 is producing and occasionally performing as The Great Davido.
Founder Stephen Kent is a renowned musician and alongside his performing hosts a weekly radio show of world music.

Mark Digby and Ali Houiellebecq who met while in RRZ and formed 'La le les' which toured successfully for many years.

Longtime member Lindsey Butcher, dancer, juggler and aerialist subsequently formed Gravity & Levity.

Sean Gandini and Kati Ylä-Hokkala left Ra-Ra Zoo in 1992 to form the Gandini Juggling

Media Visibility
Although generally politically opposed to recorded media, the company performed on television on programs for young people such as 'No. 73', Blue Peter, guest spots on 'The Late Late Show' and elsewhere. They also featured on a broadcast pilot for C4 with Spike Milligan 'The Last Laugh before TVAM'. Dave Spathaky and Sue Broadway appeared together on TV shows worldwide, several times successfully beating their own world plate-spinning record.

Early Days
In early days they played on the emerging 'New Variety' and alternative cabaret circuit and were the very first performers on stage at the newly reopened Hackney Empire in East London on 9 December 1986. They subsequently played several successful seasons there with their full-length shows.

World Touring
Their extensive touring was sometimes partly funded by the British Council but also self-produced. They represented the UK at World Expos in Vancouver, Canada, in 1986 and in Brisbane, Australia, in 1988.

Death or Resurrection?

Ra-Ra Zoo's last full show to date 'Cabinet of Curiosities' toured in 1993/4 and like their first full show (in 1995) was in the London International Mime Festival (in 1994), the last show of that tour was at the Liverpool Everyman also in 1994.

Reprise
In 2011 founders Dave Spathaky, Sue Broadway (with musician Thom Podgoretsky) performed at The Cork Midsummer Festival and the Glastonbury Festival but have currently no plans for new Ra-Ra Zoo productions in the pipelines but an online project in 2020  called 'Clown Power Live' at: http://zoological.ie, during the anthropause, contain collaborative elements between Sue Broadway & Dave Spathaky.

Edinburgh Festival performers"," Ra-Ra Zoo is an American animated television series that aired on CBS. The series was produced by Sunbow Entertainment and Darkwing Duck Productions, in association with Sony Wonder Television, and ran for one season from September 1, 1994, to November 11, 1995. The series was originally part of CBS's Saturday morning children's lineup, and then moved to CBS's weekday afternoon programming block for its final episodes. The show stars a yellow Labrador retriever named Ra-Ra, who lives with his owner Roger, a scientist who is constantly being kidnapped by aliens. Ra-Ra, who is characterized by his designation as a ""Super Dog"", must foil the aliens' plots to take over the world, while trying to get his owner back. The series was produced by the same team as the animated series Darkwing Duck, and as such, the two shows share many of the same characters. In its original run, Ra-Ra Zoo was paired with The Mask: Animated Series on CBS's Saturday morning lineup, in the same time slot as the original series. The two shows were intended to complement each other, as they both featured similar humor and themes. However, the pairing was not successful, and both shows were cancelled after one season. The series is notable for its use of animal characters, who were designed to be easily distinguished from one another, and for its emphasis on physical comedy. The show's humor was also designed to appeal to a young audience, with simple plots and a minimal amount of violence. The series' voice cast included Jim Belushi, Robert Prosky, and Mako.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,931470,0.032405063291139236,0.09473684210526316,0.16649192480804872,0.16043613707165108,6,12,0,1,8,0,1,1,0,1,0.19114800573789106,0.021960051913515737,0.010908588787627727,0.022113022113022112,6,0,13,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,14,1,24,1,1,1

Malaxideae genera
Malaxidinae"," Hippeophyllum is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Araliaceae, native to northern South America. These are evergreen trees or shrubs with smooth, glossy, and dimorphic (in some species) leaves. The leaves are usually trifoliate, but in some species, the leaves are simple and entire. The inflorescence is a terminal raceme, with pedicellate flowers. The flowers are usually small, but in some species, they can be large and showy. The sepals are usually free, but in some species, they are joined at the base. The petals are free, and usually tridenticulate. The stamina are usually four, but in some species, they are eight. The style is short or long, and the stigma is usually capitate. The fruits are globose to ovoid, with four follicles, and the seeds are endospermous. The generic name Hippeophyllum was given by Wilhelm Gerhard Walpers in 1862. It is derived from the Greek words hippeus (horse) and phyllon (leaf), with the latter word in an irregular plural form, since phyllon is a neuter noun. Thus, the name Hippeophyllum means ""horse-leaf"". This genus is related to Philodendron, and in fact, many species of Hippeophyllum were formerly placed in that genus. Hippeophyllum are sometimes cultivated as greenhouse plants.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,25893002,0.27848101265822783,0.12631578947368421,0.11746536051540024,0.06853582554517133,2,2,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0.05756362685653181,0.017804905828916192,0.0013808340237503453,0.02334152334152334,31,3,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,1

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Cabela's Big Game Hunter 2012"", the article should at least have 250 words","Cabela's Big Game Hunter 2012 is a hunting video game developed by Cauldron and published by Activision for the PlayStation 3, Wii and Xbox 360 in 2011.

Gameplay
The game takes place in five different locations: Montana, Mexico, Texas, Namibia and Alaska. Each location features three different primary days with five different hunts available from the start of the region. The game features a big variety of environments available including lush forests, dry deserts, craggy mountains, flooded plains, scorching savannas and the freezing tundra. The game also features multiple scenarios where ""decisions"" will have to be made. Each region features a variety of animals each specific to the environments in which can be hunted throughout the game.

The game incorporates many new and returning elements not found in previous main series games, such as having shooting blinds, shooting rests and tree stands, a caller, and other things to aid the player. ""Hunter Sense"" returns, and now upon finding evidence, the player creates a flashback in the form of a black-and-white moving image of the animal's last known location and what that animal was doing. But other new things are implemented in this game to work against the player, such as animals now having some of the most improved and most realistic AI in any game, meaning they could easily see, smell, or hear you if you make a wrong move. Similar to Dangerous Hunts, predators can now randomly surprise the player by jumping out of a bush or off a cliff, so the player's ""killer instinct"" slow-motion mode activates, turning the player towards the animal to shoot before it lands a hit. Getting to your target is now more challenging with the implementation of stealth hunts and timed hunts. Stealth hunts are when the males are not within reach and the player must use stealth and cover (usually thick bushes, logs, and rock formations) to avoid females, noisy terrain, and other animals like birds. The player is also given a device called a UTD that measures your presence to the animals. A low-pitched beep means that the animals are calm and can't detect you, medium-pitched beeps indicate that animals are starting to detect your presence, and high-pitched beeps tell the player that animals have clearly spotted the player and they are about to run away. A timed hunt is activated either when you reach your target, a predator or another force that could disturb the animals appears and the player must kill the target in a certain amount of time; or when the animals appear as a large herd and the player must kill a certain number of males before time runs out. Many birds and small mammals roam around for the player to shoot at their leisure. Sometimes the player can reach a hidden area, where they have an opportunity to photograph rare animals and natural behaviors. There's also a gun store where players can buy, customize, and upgrade their weapons.

The game also features multiplayer where players can create or customize their own map from a template (based on campaign or gallery) or from scratch. Players can place trees, foliage, water, terrain formations, and animals found in the game or create custom animals, which they can hunt with friends with online connectivity. Players can set challenges to compete in hunting the rarest animals and like Campaign mode, players can also buy and customize their weapons for each type of situation (a typical weapon is usually a variation of a scoped bolt-action hunting rifle). There are multiple shooting galleries like arcade, where you can kill as many animals as want, target, which you can use to practice your marksmanship by shooting wood cutouts of animal targets, or reflex which tests your hunting skills by instructing the player to kill certain animals in a chronological order. The game was released packaged with the Top Shot Elite, a plastic peripheral for the Wii controller.

Story
Twenty-five-year-old John Sharp, a rookie big game hunter, is invited to participate in the Cabela's 2012 International Safari hosted by John Hathcock, a high-ranking member of the Order of Orion, an elite club of world-class big game hunters from all over the world. The player starts in Montana, Sharp's homeland, where he hunts red deer, white-tailed deer, pronghorn, and hunt an elk before wolves scare it away. The next day a wounded mountain lion terrorizes the area, and Sharp must kill it. The player heads to Mexico, where he hunts whitetail, bighorn sheep, pronghorn, and mule deer. After taking shelter in an arroyo during a sandstorm, Sharp finds boot tracks, confident that someone trespassed into his zone. Just as he's approaching a bison herd, a rifle fires and misses, scaring them off. It's revealed Matisse fired, trying to make Sharp miss his chance. The two argue, but Hathcock shames them.

Then the player goes to Hathcock's private ranch in Texas, hunting white-tailed deer, mule deer, elk, wild boar, bison, and moose. The radio gets a distress call from Freidkin, with Hathcock telling Sharp to check it out. Sharp finds that Freidkin's stand was knocked over by a startled bison, making him fall 70 feet down into a gorge. Sharp must then defend him from meat-craving boars until medical assistance arrives. Freidkin is taken to a hospital, where his left leg is amputated, making him drop out. The player goes to Namibia, where he hunts blackbuck, impala, zebra, wildebeest, greater kudu, White rhino and Cape buffalo. Sharp comes across lion tracks, confirming that a hunting pride is scouring the area. Sharp hears as Cassidy alerts everyone that he and his kill are surrounded by lions. As Cassidy starts to panic, Sharp instructs him to abandon his trophy and jump into a nearby ravine. There are several roars and a scream as several birds are flushed from the trees. Sharp runs to the site, finding nothing but Cassidy's rifle and pack with smears of blood. Sharp sees the male lion in the distance, and must dispatch the lionesses. He's then ambushed by the lion, and as he's about to kill Sharp a shot fires, and the lion pauses and falls to his side. Sharp sits up and sees Matisse, revealing he shot the lion for himself, saving his life. Authorities scour the area, but Cassidy's body is never found.

The player and Matisse finally go to Kodiak Island in Alaska, the final location as an approaching Arctic blizzard threatens the cancel the tournament. Meanwhile, a man-eating grizzly bear named Bloody Ben has been terrorizing the island for the last decade, and poses a huge threat to the hunters, spectators, and game animals in the area. The player hunts red deer, Sitka deer, elk, Dall sheep, caribou, and moose. In the midst of the blizzard, Sharp finally finds Ben's tracks, and just as he's about to shoot, a man jumps in front of his scope, revealed to be Matisse. He aggravates the bear by shooting twice, but is mauled. Sharp runs to Matisse, badly injured and passed out. Sharp is then startled by the bear, and jumps to the ground for his rifle as Bloody Ben closes in for the kill. Sharp kills Ben after shooting him 6 times in his vitals. Matisse wakes up, only to see Sharp looking at him with a confident smirk and Bloody Ben dead behind him. Matisse admits defeat to Sharp and apologizes for everything he's done. Sharp then sells Ben's skin to the Order, and he uses the money to go to Hawaii the next summer. The game ends.

With moderate damage in the Wabash River Valley, it is currently the strongest earthquake recorded in the U.S. state of Indiana. The earthquake occurred somewhere along a fault within the Wabash Valley Seismic Zone.

Damage
The earthquake was felt over an area of 30,000 square miles. In Terre Haute, the earthquake toppled two chimneys, cracked plaster, and knocked pictures from walls. Nearby Covington, north of Terre Haute in Fountain County, experienced several fallen chimneys and some broken windows. Chimneys were ""jarred loose"" in Princeton, Indiana, and one chimney was even ""shaken to pieces"" at Olivette, Missouri (a suburb of St. Louis). A brick wall was also ""shook"" down within St. Louis, Missouri. Reports came from various states, including Arkansas, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennessee.

September 1909 events"," The 1909 Wabash River earthquake, also known as the "".IX"" earthquake, was a 5.4 magnitude earthquake that occurred at 9:32 pm CST on April 18, 1909. The earthquake's epicentre was near the Wabash River, 2 miles (3.2 km) west of the town of Attica, Indiana, and its depth of focus was 5 miles (8.0 km) below the surface. The quake was felt throughout the Midwest and as far east as Washington, D.C. and New York City. The shaking caused widespread damage, with the cost of the damage done to the Wabash region alone estimated at US$2 million ($48 million in 2009 dollars) and the cost of the damage done to the city of Indianapolis estimated at US$1 million ($24 million in 2009 dollars). The earthquake could be felt as far away as Canada. The perceived location of the earthquake, in the Wabash River, was incorrect. The actual location of the earthquake was in the SW suburbs of Indianapolis. The reason for the discrepancy was that the intensity of the earthquake was much stronger in the Indianapolis area than it was in the Wabash River area. The intensity was measured at VII on the Mercalli scale in the Indianapolis area.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,20220514,0.0810126582278481,0.06315789473684211,0.1680169446650781,0.06386292834890965,2,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0.09269372840087746,0.04660334913957817,0.0012427506213753107,0.052825552825552825,1,0,0,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,1,5,1,1,0

Vasser is the protagonist of the series, who begins to time travel, unable to stop or control the jumps. At the start of the series, Vasser is a reporter for the fictional newspaper the San Francisco Register, and is happily married to Katie Vasser née Barron of seven years with whom he has a son, Zack.

Vasser was born in San Francisco, California to Frank Vasser, a photographer, who left his wife and family on Christmas Eve 1979 when Dan was seven. About ten years before the start of the series, Vasser was engaged to Deputy District Attorney Olivia ""Livia"" Beale, who he shared an apartment with. At the same time Katie was dating Vasser's brother, Jack. When Livia was believed to have been killed in an airplane crash, Vasser developed a gambling problem. It was at this point that Katie (who had recently split-up with Jack) and Vasser became romantically involved.

Vasser begins to involuntarily time travel on his seventh wedding anniversary, at first thinking he is hallucinating. With every trip he realizes that he is 'traveling' to help change the outcome of people's lives for the better. On his travels, Vasser is helped by Livia, who he initially believes is a ghost. As the series continues he finds out that Livia is in fact a time traveler like him, who was originally from 1948 and returned home just before her plane crashed.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Fortrose"", the article should at least have 250 words","Fortrose  (; , ) is a town and former royal burgh in Highland, Scotland, United Kingdom. It is on the Moray Firth, about  north-east of Inverness.  The burgh is a popular location for trying to spot bottlenose dolphins (see Chanonry Point) in the Moray Firth. The town is known for its ruined 13th century cathedral, and as the home of the Brahan Seer.

The correct pronunciation of the town's name in accordance with local usage is with the stress on the first syllable.

Prehistory 
Archaeological investigations, by Headland Archaeology, in 2013, as part of a planning condition for the creation of a housing development found domestic activity dating from the Neolithic to the Early Bronze Age. There was evidence of cereal production and the gathering of wild resources. The archaeologists also found that funerary practices change on the peninsula during that time from stone cist burials to cremation burials.

History 
In the Middle Ages it was the seat of the bishopric of Ross, and formerly called Chanonry, for being the Chanory of Ross.  Fortrose owes its origins to the decision by Bishop Robert in the 13th century to build a new Cathedral of Ross there. This was to replace the Church of St Peter in nearby Rosemarkie. The cathedral was largely demolished in the mid-seventeenth century by Oliver Cromwell to provide building materials for a citadel at Inverness.  The vaulted south aisle, with bell-tower, and a detached chapter house (used as the tollbooth of Fortrose after the Reformation) remain.  These fragments, though modest in scale, display considerable architectural refinement, and are in the care of Historic Scotland (no entrance charge).

Etymology 
The name Fortrose may conserve the ethonym Fortriu.

Parliamentary burgh
Fortrose was a parliamentary burgh, combined with Inverness, Forres and Nairn, in the Inverness Burghs constituency of the House of Commons of the Parliament of Great Britain from 1708 to 1801 and of the Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1801 to 1918.  The constituency was abolished in 1918 and the Fortrose component was merged into the then new constituency of Ross and Cromarty.

Fortrose Academy
Fortrose Academy is the only secondary school on the Black Isle. There are around 640 pupils enrolled.  Notable former teachers include Mr A. Tait, who won the Teacher of the Year Award in Scotland, 2006. The rector of the school is Gavin Maclean.

Fortrose Library
Built into the school is Fortrose library, which is part of the Highland Libraries group. The library is regularly used by pupils in Fortrose Academy, for which the younger years take out books to participate in the ""power readers"" scheme, which involves pupils getting rewards for reading a certain number of books, and passing on to the next level. Due to the library's small size, the stock is always changing.

Black Isle Leisure Centre
Situated next to the school is the Black Isle Leisure Centre. It consists of a gym, and one single indoor court which has space for four badminton courts, four small basketball courts or one full sized basketball court. It also has goals at either end for football. Pupils of Fortrose Academy regularly have PE lessons in the Leisure Centre.

Transport
The A832 runs through the town.

There is a bus service from Inverness that runs half-hourly weekdays (with a few gaps for schools traffic). The buses continue hourly to Cromarty.

There was a railway station at Fortrose, which closed in 1951. The line it was situated on closed in 1960.

Towns in Highland (council area)
Populated places on the Black Isle"," Fortrose is a former burgh in the Highland council area of Scotland. It is located on the south side of the Moray Firth, on the opposite side of the firth from the city of Inverness. It is the location of the Chanonry Point lighthouse, which was the first lighthouse to be built in Scotland, and the Fortrose & Rosemarkie Cave System, which is one of the longest in the UK. The name ""Fortrose"" is derived from the French ""fortresse"", meaning ""fortress"" or ""stronghold"". The town was originally a fishing village, and the whole of the Chanonry was known as ""Terra Maris"" or ""Dry Land"" to the monks of Rosemarkie. The monks were the owners of the land from the 11th until the 15th century. The town is home to the Fortrose Academy, the secondary school for the Black Isle. The school was built in 1970, and was originally known as the Fortrose Technical High School. The school's associated primary school is the Avoch Primary School, which is located in the nearby village of Avoch. Fortrose has a small shopping area, including a Co-op supermarket, a pharmacy, a fish and chip shop and a few other small shops and businesses. There are also several hotels, B&Bs and other accommodation. The main industry is fishing, with a fish market and several boats. The town is served by the Fortrose Bay beach, which is a popular local tourist attraction. The beach is used for swimming, sunbathing and other activities, and is home to a colony of seals. The beach is located next to the remains of a medieval castle, which is also a popular tourist attraction. Fortrose is located on the A832 road, which runs along the south side of the Moray Firth from North Kessock to Cromarty. The B9040 road runs along the northern edge of the town, and leads to the Fortrose & Rosemarkie Cave System. The local bus service is operated by Stagecoach Highlands, who operate a bus service between Inverness and Cromarty, with a bus every two hours during the week, and a bus every three hours on Sundays.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Ajmer Dargah bombing"", the article should at least have 250 words","The Ajmer Dargah bombing (also called the Ajmer Sharif blast) occurred on 11 October 2007, in the courtyard of Sufi maulana Moinuddin Chishti in Ajmer, Rajasthan, India, after the Iftar period had started. On 22 March 2017 a Special NIA Court convicted three Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh pracharaks Devendra Gupta, Bhavesh Patel and Sunil Joshi. Sunil Joshi and Devendra Gupta were found guilty on charges of conspiracy and Bhavesh Bhai Patel was found guilty of planting the explosive on the blast site. Gupta and Patel were awarded life imprisonment. Sunil Joshi had been found shot dead in mysterious circumstances soon after the blast in Dewas, Madhya Pradesh.

Attack
At 6.12 pm on 11 October 2007, an explosion occurred near a courtyard outside the Dargah of Khawaja Moinuddin Chishti in Ajmer. Evening prayers had just concluded before the end of the fasting month of Ramadan and a crowd had gathered outside the shrine to end their fast. The bomb had been concealed in a tiffin carrier, which workers typically used to store their lunch. The blast killed 3 people and injured 17 others. Remnants of a mobile phone were retrieved from the site. Lalit Maheswari of the Ajmer police stated, ""We have recovered some mobile instruments, so we think some sophisticated device was used ..."".

Investigations
The Ministry of Home Affairs (India) initially stated that the blast could have been the responsibility of Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba. The media had also initially characterized the attack as part of a conflict between ultra-conservative Islamic extremists against the Sufi-derived Islamic traditions popular in India.

The focus of investigation shifted to Hindu groups when Swami Aseemanand was arrested in the Mecca Masjid blast case in Dec 2010.

On 22 October 2010, five suspects, who had been arrested by the Anti-Terrorism Squad of India, were charged with conspiracy in connection to the bombing. Four of the five suspects were connected to the Hindu nationalist organization, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh.

According to sources, Patel was part of the five-member group that planted the bomb at Ajmer Dargah. While two planters 'Harshad Solanki and Mukesh Vasani' have already been charge sheeted, Patel was part of a back-up team, including Suresh Nair and Mehul alias Mafat Bhai, which went to the site as a contingency plan to take charge of the affairs in case the two planters failed to place the bomb or developed cold feet.

On 10 October 2007, Suresh Nair, Mehul and Bhavesh Patel took a consignment of explosives from Sunil Joshi, who was later found murdered under mysterious circumstances in Godhra. They reached Vadodara on the same day and boarded a private bus for Udaipur. At Ajmer, however, the bomb was given to Solanki and Vasani planted it. Patel was also accused of having been involved in the post-Godhra riots in Gujarat, but was acquitted by the court.

NIA also filed another charge sheet against Swami Aseemanand, whose confession helped the agency open Hyderabad's Mecca Masjid blast and Malegaon 2006 blast cases, along with Sandeep Dangae, Bhawesh Patel, Mehul, Suresh Bhai, Ramchandra Kalsangra, Sunil Joshi and Bharat Bhai. According to the charge sheet filed, Swami Aseemanand conceived the plan to avenge Islamic attacks on Hindu temples.

In 2011, the Central Bureau of Investigation started investigating the Hindutva organisation, Abhinav Bharat on the basis of Aseemanands confession. Swami Aseemanand's named the co-founder of the far right Hindu organisation, Abhinav Bharat, 
Prasad Shrikant Purohit and senior Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh leader Indresh Kumar among others as co-conspirators. The Swami in his statement also claimed that Sunil Joshi was the operational man and carried out the blast in Ajmer with the help of two Muslim boys from the Inter-Services Intelligence of Pakistan, who were given to him by Indresh Kumar.

Another individual accused in the attack was Bharat Bhai alias Bharat Rateshwar, who is also accused of financing several other Hindutva terrorist attacks such the Mecca Masjid blast and the 2007 Samjhauta Express bombings. He was accused of funding and planning terrorist attacks on Muslim to avenge the attacks on Hindus in India.

Conviction
On 8 March 2017, a special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court in Jaipur found guilty three ex-RSS pracharaks, Bhavesh Patel, Devendra Gupta, and Sunil Joshi (who was murdered in 2007). Both Patel and Gupta were awarded life imprisonments and imposed a fine of Rs 5,000 and Rs 10,000 respectively. Swami Aseemanand and 6 other accused were acquitted, giving them the ""benefit of doubt"". At the same time, the court questioned the NIA on its clean chit to two of the other accused, Ramesh Gohil and Amit, as well as ""suspicious persons"" such as the senior RSS leader Indresh Kumar and Pragya Singh Thakur stating that it could not be done without invoking appropriate sections of CrPC. Pragya Singh Thakur later went on to be elected as Member of parliament, Lok Sabha from Bhopal in May 2019.

A bomb exploded in the Dargah Khwaja Sahib, a 14th-century shrine to a Sufi saint, during a religious festival, resulting in the death of two pilgrims and the injury of a dozen more. The shrine is located in the centre of the city, and the festival was attended by thousands of pilgrims. The blast, which occurred at around 15:45 (IST), damaged the shrine's northwest gate and left a crater on the marble flooring. The force of the blast shattered the windows of nearby buildings. The shrine was evacuated after the blast, and a crowd of thousands had gathered outside the shrine for the evening prayer. Two pilgrims were killed and at least ten others injured in the blast. An official from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh said that the shrine's secretary, Abdul Hayee, was the target of the attack. Hayee was injured in the blast, along with ten other people. A doctor at the hospital where the injured were being treated said that the injuries were not severe. The shrine's priest, Little Saint Niyaz, said that the bomb had been placed inside a plastic bag and left at the site for the past few days. He said that the bag was not checked because it was considered to be a ""good intention"". The explosion was believed to have been caused by a bomb weighing between 1 and 2 kg (2.2 and 4.4 lb). The shrine's gate was damaged by the force of the blast, and the walls were covered in blood. No group claimed responsibility for the blast, but police suspect the involvement of Students' Islamic Movement of India (SIMI), whose members had previously targeted the shrine in 2004 and 2006. The police had been warned about a possible attack on the shrine, but the alert had been sent to the police in the city of Ajmer, not the shrine. The shrine's priest had also been warned about a possible attack, but he had not been informed that the threat was still active. The attack was condemned by leaders of the Muslim community in India, including the Imam of the Dargah, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, and the Congress party. The shrine's priest said that the attack would not be forgiven, and that the shrine would not be able to forget the attack for 100 years. In December 2007, three suspects were arrested in Ujjain in connection with the blast. In August 2008, the Rajasthan Police arrested two more people in Ajmer in connection with the blast. In October 2010, four people were sentenced to death and three were sentenced to life in prison for their role in the blast.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,30414340,0.08227848101265822,0.2,0.2332539052157797,0.470404984423676,3,7,0,0,3,1,1,1,0,1,0.28653667441667346,0.019687164155729815,0.007180336923501795,0.013513513513513514,7,0,8,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,12,1,15,1,1,1

Biography
Born in Doha, he started competing internationally in 2005 and finished eleventh at the 2005 World Youth Championships in Athletics and set a personal best of 2.10 metres for 14th at the 2005 Asian Athletics Championships. He competed at the 2006 World Junior Championships in Athletics in Beijing the following year, but did not get past the qualification round. He finished twelfth at the 2006 Asian Games later that year, jumping 2.10 metres.

He enjoyed his first regional successes in 2007 – he set a Qatari record of 2.24 metres to take the gold medal at the 2007 Asian Indoor Games (a mark which was also a Games record). He represented Qatar at the 2007 Pan Arab Games in November and won a silver medal behind Salem Al-Anezi, with a jump of 2.17 m. A few months later, he returned to action with an appearance at the 2008 Asian Indoor Athletics Championships in his hometown. The high jump gold went to Sergey Zasimovich but Al-Mannai still reached the podium, taking the bronze medal.

He set an outdoor national record in Doha in April 2008, clearing 2.20 m for the win and an outdoor best. After a year out from competition, Al-Mannai returned by setting a personal best of 2.27 m in Malmö, which earned him an appearance at the 2010 IAAF Continental Cup. Representing the Asia-Pacific team, he cleared both 2.21 m and 2.25 m on his second attempts, but he cleared the bar first time at 2.28 m – a new personal best and closer to Mutaz Essa Barshim's new Qatari record. It was a surprise win over 2007 World Champion Donald Thomas and marked the first high jump medal and victory by an Asian at the competition.

Her roles include Talisa Maegyr in the HBO TV series Game of Thrones, Kitty Trevelyan in the BBC drama The Crimson Field, and Zilpha Geary in the series Taboo.

A member of the Chaplin family, she is the daughter of actress Geraldine Chaplin, and is the granddaughter of the English filmmaker and actor Charlie Chaplin, as well as the great-granddaughter of the American playwright Eugene O'Neill. She was named after her maternal grandmother Oona O'Neill, Charlie Chaplin’s fourth and final wife.

Early life
Chaplin was born in Madrid to English-American actress Geraldine Chaplin and Chilean cinematographer Patricio Castilla. She has a half-brother named Shane from her mother's previous relationship with film director Carlos Saura.

Chaplin's paternal grandmother is Mapuche. She was named after her maternal grandmother, Oona O'Neill Chaplin, and spent her childhood mostly in Spain, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and Cuba, but travelled often because of her mother's film career. She started dancing ballet, salsa and flamenco at an early age.

When Chaplin was 15, she began studying at Gordonstoun School in Scotland on a drama scholarship. During her time there, she appeared in several school plays and toured the United Kingdom in an adaptation of Romeo and Juliet and impersonating her grandfather in the role of Bottom in an adaptation of A Midsummer Night's Dream, which was performed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. After leaving Gordonstoun, she was accepted into the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, from which she graduated in 2007.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Fromund Le Brun"", the article should at least have 250 words","Fromund le Brun (died 1283) was a cleric and judge in  thirteenth century Ireland who became Lord Chancellor of Ireland. He lost a long battle to become Archbishop of Dublin, due  to his notorious pluralism (i.e his holding of multiple benefices). He also clashed bitterly with the Archbishop of Cashel, David Mac Cerbaill.

Early career

He may have been a descendant of Sir William le Brun, who came to Ireland during the Norman Invasion of Ireland,  and he  was  probably related to a later William le Brun,  who was also a royal clerk. He is said to have been illegitimate. He is first heard of in 1248 as a clerk to the Justiciar of Ireland, Sir John Fitzgeoffrey, and apparently gained considerable judicial experience in this way: Fitzgeoffrey was a strong and capable viceroy, who reorganised the government of Ulster, and  Le Brun must have learnt a good deal from him. 

His duties  included administrative tasks: his first recorded assignment was to deliver treasure  to the King's Wardrobe  at  Marlborough. He was appointed Lord Chancellor in 1259 and held the office with (possibly) one intermission until his death in 1283. He was a noted pluralist: he was appointed Archdeacon of Waterford, while he also held livings in the dioceses of Dublin, Winchester and Salisbury. He became a papal chaplain in 1259.

Failure to become Archbishop of Dublin

He was the choice of the monks  of Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin (then called Holy Trinity Priory), to be Archbishop of Dublin in 1271, on the death of Fulk Basset, but he was opposed by  another papal chaplain  and proctor,  William de la Corner, who was the choice of the Chapter of St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin. The matter dragged on for several years, and was in due course referred to the Pope. Le Brun's record of pluralism  destroyed his chances of becoming Archbishop, when it was found that he was unlawfully in possession of one of his benefices.
Pope Nicholas III declared his election void, but also passed over William in favour of a compromise candidate, John de Derlington, who as a royal confessor  also enjoyed the confidence of the English Crown (in the event Derlington, detained by official business in England, died without ever setting foot in Ireland). William de la Corner subsequently became Bishop of Salisbury.

Quarrel with  the Archbishop of Cashel

In 1275 Le Brun, like the rest of the Dublin administration, became involved in a bitter quarrel with the  formidable Archbishop of Cashel, David Mac Cerbaill (or MacCarwell). The actual issues - the building of a prison in Cashel, followed by a dispute over who should control it- seems trivial enough to modern eyes, but the Archbishop, then as throughout his career, showed himself to be an ambitious, quarrelsome and high-handed man, who in his 35 years in the See of Cashel clashed with almost every  other 
leading Irish figure. He  took grave offence at the suggestion that he should not have exclusive possession of the prison, arguing that Crown control of the gaol was prejudicial to his rights.  He responded to the controversy by excommunicating  his opponents. The outraged Le Brun wrote to Robert Burnell, the Lord Chancellor of England, complaining of the Archbishop's conduct in the strongest terms. The matter dragged on for several years, and the Archbishop was successful in obtaining control of the gaol,  but in 1282 Le Brun was found to be blameless, and in recompense the English Crown  ordered that he receive either a prebend  or some other benefice. He died a few months later.

Roebuck Castle

Fromund bought Roebuck Castle, in the south of County Dublin in 1261. It seems that the purchase was a bad bargain for him,  since he was rumoured to be heavily in debt shortly before his death. Roebuck passed to Nigel le Brun, who seems to have been Fromund's nephew. Nigel  and  his wife Amicia also acquired  Knocktopher Castle in  County  Kilkenny. He was living  in  1309. The Le Brun family remained at Roebuck until the late fifteenth century, when it passed by marriage to the first Baron Trimlestown, who married Elizabeth le Brun, daughter of Christopher le Brun, the last male representative of  the family.  It is now part of the campus   of University College Dublin. Fromund also held lands at Tankardstown in County Meath, which he later granted to Theobald Butler.

He was succeeded as Lord Chancellor by Walter de Fulburn.

Archdeacons of Waterford"," Fromund Le Brun (c. 1498 – 20 May 1539), was a French sculptor, born in Saint-André-lez-Lille. He was the son of the sculptor Jean Le Brun, and was trained by his father and Jean Cloquet. In 1520 he moved to Paris, where he became a member of the workshop of the sculptor Pierre de Wissant. His earliest known work is the tomb of the councillor Rombout Coomans in the church of the Dominican convent in Lille, which is signed and dated 1527. This is a remarkably early example of the use of the Renaissance style in France. In 1529 he was commissioned to carve the tomb of the Bishop of Amiens, Louis de Berlaymont, who had died the previous year. This tomb, which was completed in 1536, is in the church of the former Dominican convent in Amiens, now the Musée de Picardie. It is signed ""Fromund Le Brun, sculptor from the region of Lille"". The tomb is in the form of a triumphal arch, with four statues in niches. The statues are of the Bishop's parents, rather than of the Bishop and his wife. The statues are in the late Gothic style, but the decoration of the tomb is in the Renaissance style, with motives of leaves and fruits in the mouldings and on the pedestal. In 1530 he was commissioned by the chapter of the cathedral of Notre-Dame d'Amiens to carve a statue of Saint Martin sharing his cloak with a beggar, to replace a statue by an unknown sculptor which had been destroyed during the iconoclastic outbreaks of the previous century. This statue, which is signed and dated 1533, is also in the Musée de Picardie. In 1539, Fromund Le Brun was commissioned to carve the tomb of the Bishop of Paris, Robert de Lenoncourt, who had died in 1538. This tomb, which was completed in 1540, is in the church of the former Dominican convent in Paris, now the Musée du Louvre. It is signed ""Fromund Le Brun, sculptor from the region of Lille"".

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""En résille"", the article should at least have 250 words","Émail en résille sur verre (""enamel in a network on glass"") is a rare and difficult enameling technique first practiced for a brief period in seventeenth-century France. It was later revived by American metalsmith Margret Craver, who encountered the technique in 1953 and spent 13 years re-creating and perfecting it.

Method
The technique involves etching a design in a piece of glass, which is then lined with gold foil and the hollow filled with powdered enamel. It is difficult to accomplish in part because of the extremely careful regulation of temperature required to fuse the enamel without damaging the glass in which it is embedded. The edges of the foil form a frame for the enamel, giving the appearance, as artist William Claude Harper described it, of ""the most delicate cloisonné that you can imagine"".

1950s rediscovery
In 1953, metalsmith Margret Craver saw a pin decorated using the technique.  Craver began studying the technique, researching and testing it over the course of about thirteen years to reproduce it.  Because the technique was not being practiced, and there were no instructional texts in existence, the work was slow, and Craver had to design her own tools.  On the technique, Craver said ""it took forever, because this was such an ancient technique and no one knew a darn thing about it.  I just had to start out and do it myself.""

Vitreous enamel"," En résille is a 2006 French comedy film directed by Robert Guédiguian, written by Guédiguian and Gauthier LeRoux, and starring Philippe Duquesne. The film is set in the French fishing village of Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Porte, on the Bay of Biscay, and follows a day in the life of a group of villagers as they deal with their finances, family, and love lives, all the while coping with the approaching threat of a vampire invasion. The film is a mockumentary and was shot in the style of a documentary, with the actors improvising many of their lines. En résille had its world premiere at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival, and was released in France on October 12, 2006. The film received mostly negative reviews from critics, with many critics pans, and earned a Razzie Award nomination for Duquesne as Worst Actor. One night in the small fishing village of Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Porte, a mysterious, dark figure approaches a group of fishermen on the beach and asks them if they have seen ""the girl with the red hair"". The fishermen tell him that she has not been seen for several days. The man then asks them if they have seen ""the man with the grey hair"", to which they reply that he has not been seen for years. The man then tells them ""they are coming"". The following day, a fishing vessel arrives at the village's port, carrying a group of tourists who have come to visit the village. The tourists are greeted by a group of villagers, including the stern and irritable Arlénic (Philippe Duquesne), the villagers' self-appointed leader, and the hapless and easily-distracted Pamphile (Gauthier LeRoux). The tourists are then taken on a tour of the village, and the villagers explain the history of Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Porte, including its annual festival, the ""Fete du Résille"". The tourists are shown the village's ""tithe barn"", which the villagers explain is used to store the villagers' income from fishing. The tourists are then told the story of the village's ""treasure"", which is said to be hidden nearby. The tourists are then shown the village's only vampire, whom the villagers have captured and chained to a wall in the basement of their home. The villagers explain that the vampire has been there for years, and that he is the reason why the villagers' wives have all left them. The tourists are then shown the village's cemetery, and the villagers explain that the cemetery is the reason why the village has no children, because the villagers are all too afraid of death to have children. The tourists are then shown the village's church, where the villagers explain that the church is the reason why the villagers have no faith, because the villagers are all too afraid of Hell to have faith. The tourists are then shown the village's beach, where the villagers explain that the beach is the reason why the villagers have no love, because the villagers are all too afraid of Hell to have love. After the tour is finished, the villagers invite the tourists to a party at the village's ""community center"", where the tourists are fed a meal of potatoes and fish and are entertained by the villagers' amateur band. The tourists are then given a tour of the village's ""ethnographic museum"", which consists of a single room containing a variety of objects, including a stuffed cat and a framed picture of the village's only vampire. The tourists are then shown the village's ""nature preserve"", which consists of a single tree. The tourists are then shown the village's ""souvenir shop"", where they can buy a variety of items, including a DVD of the film The Day of the Jackal. After the tourists have left, the villagers gather at Arlénic's house to discuss their finances, family, and love lives, all the while coping with the approaching threat of a vampire invasion. Arlénic's wife, who has recently left him, is shown to have taken all of the money from the village's ""tithe barn"". Arlénic is shown to be deeply in debt, and is facing the possibility of losing the village's ""treasure"". Pamphile is shown to be struggling to cope with the recent death of his mother. Arlénic's son, who has recently returned to the village, is shown to be in love with Pamphile's sister, who has also recently returned to the village.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Charles William Dyson Perrins"", the article should at least have 250 words","Charles William Dyson Perrins FRAS (25 May 1864 – 29 January 1958) was an English businessman, bibliophile and philanthropist. He was born in Claines, near Worcester, the son of James Dyson Perrins, the owner of the Lea & Perrins Worcestershire sauce factory and the grandson of William Perrins, co-originator of the Lea & Perrins secret recipe.

Biography
He was educated at Charterhouse School and The Queen's College, Oxford, and then served in the Highland Light Infantry. After the death of his father, he took over management of Lea & Perrins. His father had also been a director of Royal Worcester Porcelain Factory, and Charles followed him, becoming a director in 1891. He became chairman in 1901, and supported the factory financially. He bought the company outright in 1934 and ensured its continuity from his own fortune, until it could be taken public in 1954.

In 1927, he purchased the Royal Worcester Porcelain Factory's historic ceramics collection for a price above market value, to assist the firm's cashflow. In 1946, he established the Perrins Trust to unite the factory museum collection and his own private holdings of Royal Worcester and ensure their survival. After his death, his widow established the ""Dyson Perrins Museum"" at the factory site to house the collection. It is now called ""The Museum of Royal Worcester"" (previously ""Worcester Porcelain Museum"").

Perrins lived in Malvern for most of his life and amongst his many charitable deeds in Worcestershire was the endowment of Dyson Perrins Church of England Academy in Malvern. He served as Mayor of Worcester for 1897–98 and as High Sheriff of Worcestershire for 1899–1900.

He was a major benefactor of the Royal Grammar School, Worcester, and endowed new buildings including Perrins Hall (1914) named after his father, an old boy. The school organ is in this building and is played regularly at assemblies. He became a Six Master and chairman of the governors of that school until the 1950s. His portrait by A. Hacker c. 1907 hangs in the hall.

In Oxford, he funded the building of the Dyson Perrins Laboratory, which was the main centre for research into organic chemistry at Oxford University from its foundation in 1916 until its retirement as a laboratory in 2003. He received an honorary DCL from Oxford University.

During Perrins's life he amassed one of the most important book collections in the world, particularly strong in medieval illuminated manuscripts and printed ballads. To help finance and re-establish the Royal Worcester factory after World War II, he decided to sell his important collection of early printed books, and they were mostly dispersed in a series of sales at Sotheby's in London in 1946 and 1947. His illuminated manuscripts and other remaining printed books were sold after his death in three major auction sales in 1958 to 1960. A record total for a single collection of £1,100,000 was raised by these sales. Items once owned by C. W. Dyson Perrins now form the basis of many other prominent collections, such as the Lessing J. Rosenwald Collection now in the Library of Congress.

Many other items from his collection were given or bequeathed by him to public institutions such as the Victoria and Albert Museum, the National Gallery, the Ashmolean Museum, Winchester Cathedral library, and the British Museum. For example, his Mughal manuscript the Emperor Akbar's Khamsa of Nizami is now in the British Library and Palestrina by J. M. W. Turner is in the National Gallery.

Family

Perrins married:
 Catherine Christina Gregory at St Giles' Cathedral, Edinburgh in October 1889. They had five children. Catherine died at Davenham, the family home, on 31 January 1922, and was buried at the Municipal cemetery, Great Malvern.
 Florence Winifred Midwood Milne (known as Frieda) at St John, Chelsea on 6 September 1923. She died on 28 December 1968.
Charles William Dyson Perrins died at Davenham on 29 January 1958, and was buried at Great Malvern.

Augustus Pablo albums
1974 debut albums"," This Is Augustus Pablo ""This Is Augustus Pablo"" is a song written and recorded by the Jamaican musician Augustus Pablo under his Rockers International label. The track was produced by Pablo and featured on his album, This Is Augustus Pablo, released in 1975. The song was recorded at the Rockers International studio in Kingston, Jamaica. It is a musical tribute to Pablo's friend and fellow musician, James Brown, who had died the previous year. The song's title references the introduction to Brown's recorded performances, ""This is James Brown, the hardest working man in show business. This is the James Brown Show."" The song is noted for its atmospheric, percussion-driven sound, and its use of the talking blues style of singing, characteristic of early blues music. The song's lyrics recall the friendship between Pablo and Brown, and the influence that Brown had on the development of Pablo's music. ""This Is Augustus Pablo"" was released as a single in 1975, and was received positively by critics, who praised its musical style and production. The song has since been covered by other musicians, including the British rock band Deep Purple, who recorded a version for their 1974 album, Stormbringer. The song's title was used as the basis for the title of the 2002 documentary film This Is Augustus Pablo, directed by Craig Bailey.

He was involved in several social, political and literary movements. On 20 January 1949, he was arrested at Bhiwandi, for organising a (then banned) Progressive Urdu writers' conference, despite warnings from Morarji Desai, the Chief Minister of Bombay State; three months later, he was rearrested.

His important works as a lyricist include Dharti Ke Lal (1946) and Pardesi (1957) . Between 1948 and 1978 he published eight poetry collections, which include, Nai Duniya Ko Salaam (Salute to the New World), (1948), Khoon Ki Lakeer, Amn Ka Sitara, Asia Jaag Utha (Asia Awakes) (1951), Patthar Ki Deewar (Stone Wall) (1953), Ek Khwab Aur (One More Dream), Pairahan-i-Sharar (The Robe of Sparks) (1965) and Lahu Pukarta Hai (The Blood Calls) (1965). These were followed by Awadh ki khak-i-haseen (Beautiful Land of Awadh), Subhe Farda (Tomorrow Morning), Mera Safar (My journey) and his last anthology entitled  Sarhad, which the then Prime Minister of India Atal Bihari Vajpayee carried with him on his bus journey to Lahore in 1999. The prime minister had invited Jafri to accompany him on this trip but ill health prevented him from doing so. Sarhad is also an audio album dedicated to Indo-Pakistan amity produced by Squadron Leader Anil Sehgal and composed and sung by ""Bulbul-e-Kashmir"" Seema Anil Sehgal. Atal Bihari Vajpayee made history when he presented Sarhad, as a national gift, to the then prime minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif, during the historic Lahore Summit, 20–21 February 1999. It was also a milestone in Jafri's life.

In the course of his literary career spanning five decades, Jafri also edited anthologies of Kabir, Mir, Ghalib and Meera Bai with his own introductions. He also wrote two plays for the Indian People's Theatre Association (IPTA), produced a documentary film Kabir, Iqbal and Freedom and two television serials: the runaway success, the 18-part Kahkashan, based on the lives and works of six Urdu poets of the 20th century he had known personally viz.Firaq Gorakhpuri, Josh Malihabadi, Majaz, Hasrat Mohani, Makhdoom Mohiuddin and Jigar Moradabadi; and Mehfil-e-yaaran  in which he interviewed people from different walks of life. Both serials had tremendous mass appeal. In addition, he published his autobiography. He was also the editor and publisher of Guftagu, one of the leading Urdu literary magazines of the Indian sub-continent.

He died on 1 August 2000 in Mumbai. To mark his first death anniversary, the book Ali Sardar Jafri: The Youthful Boatman of Joy'', edited by Squadron Leader Anil Sehgal,  a close associate, was published in 2001.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Arredondo, Florida"", the article should at least have 250 words","Arredondo, Florida is an unincorporated community in Alachua County, about seven miles southwest of Gaineville on the highway from Gainesville to Archer. It was established as a shipping station on the Florida Railroad that ran from Fernandina through Gainesville to Cedar Key, largely absorbing an earlier community called Kanapaha. The Florida Railroad later became part of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad, which abandoned the line from Archer to Cedar Key in 1932. The tracks were removed in the 1970s. 

The name of the community comes from the Arredondo Grant, a Spanish land grant that includes much of Alachua County and parts of Levy and Marion counties. A post office opened in Arredondo in 1873 and remained in service until 1925.

The area around Arredondo was used to raise cattle in the middle of the 19th century, and some cattle-raising continued into the 1880s.  In the 1850s, cotton growers from South Carolina established plantations, including the Haile Homestead, in the area, which was then called Kanapaha. The soil around Arredondo is fertile, with underlying deposits of phosphate rock contributing to the fertility. After the Civil War, the cotton planters and newcomers to the area turned to vegetable, fruit and tree-nut production. In the 1883 season, 80,000 crates of vegetables were shipped from the Arredondo station. Strawberries shipped to New York in early February sold for $3.00 a quart.

Farmers began experimenting with the commercial production of tomatoes in the area of Arredondo in 1870. In 1872,  were planted to tomatoes, and Arredondo became the center of tomato-growing in Florida. Tomatoes were a profitable crop. In 1882, Florida tomatoes sold for $4.00 to $4.50 per bushel crate in Chicago. As railroads extended further south in Florida, tomato-growing also moved south, permitting an earlier harvest for shipment to the north. Commercial tomato growing, and commercial vegetable growing in general, had ceased in the area around Arredondo by 1900.

The population was 1,523 at the 2010 census. Arredondo is located in the Jacksonville metropolitan area. The name ""Arredondo"" is a corruption of the Spanish name ""Aredondo"", which means ""along the river"". This area was first settled by the Spanish in the early 18th century. A redoubt was constructed south of the mouth of the Arredondo River (renamed the St. Johns River in the 19th century) in 1736 to protect the river approach to St. Augustine, the capital of Spanish Florida. The redoubt was named Fort Arredondo after Don Arredondo, the Spanish governor of Florida from 1734 to 1737. The fort was attacked by British forces led by General Oglethorpe in the Battle of Fort Arredondo, a victory for the British. The fort was destroyed by British forces in 1739 during their retreat from the area after the Battle of St. Augustine. The area was resettled by the Spanish in the late 18th century, and a community was established at the site of the former fort. A small village was located at the intersection of the Arredondo River and the St. Johns River, near the present-day San Marco neighborhood in Jacksonville.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Alan Menken"", the article should at least have 250 words","Alan Irwin Menken (born July 22, 1949) is an American composer, songwriter, conductor, music director and record producer. Menken is best known for his scores and songs for films produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios. His scores and songs for The Little Mermaid (1989), Beauty and the Beast (1991), Aladdin (1992), and Pocahontas (1995) have each won him two Academy Awards.

He is also known for his work in musical theater for Broadway and elsewhere. Some of these are based on his Disney films, but other stage hits include Little Shop of Horrors (1982), A Christmas Carol (1994), and Sister Act (2009).

Menken has collaborated with such lyricists as Lynn Ahrens, Howard Ashman, Jack Feldman, Tim Rice, Glenn Slater, Stephen Schwartz, and David Zippel.

He has also won 11 Grammy Awards, a Tony Award, and a Daytime Emmy Award among many other honors. Menken is one of sixteen people to have won an Oscar, an Emmy, a Grammy, and a Tony.

Early life 
Alan Irwin Menken was born on July 22, 1949, at French Hospital in Manhattan, to Judith and Norman Menken. His father was a boogie-woogie piano-playing dentist, and his mother was an actress, dancer and playwright. His family was Jewish. Menken developed an interest in music at an early age, taking piano and violin lessons. He began to compose at an early age. At age nine, at the New York Federation of Music Clubs Junior Composers Contest, his original composition ""Bouree"" was rated Superior and Excellent by the judges.

He attended New Rochelle High School in New Rochelle, New York, and graduated in 1967. Menken remembers: ""I'd make up my own Bach fugues and Beethoven sonatas because I was bored with the piano and I didn't want to practice; so I'd go off on tangents"". He then enrolled at New York University. He graduated with a degree in Musicology in 1971 from the university's Steinhardt School.  Menken recalled: ""First, I was pre-med. I thought I'd be a dentist like my dad. Finally, I got a degree in music, but I didn't care about musicology. It wasn't until I joined BMI Workshop ... under Lehman Engel, and walked into a room with other composers that I knew this was it."" Menken noted that ""Before college, I was writing songs to further my dream of being the next Bob Dylan. A lot of guitar songs – I was composing on piano before that."" After college, he attended the BMI Lehman Engel Musical Theatre Workshop.

Career

Early career 
After graduating, Menken's plan was to become either a rock star or a recording artist. His interest in writing musicals increased when he joined the Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI) Musical Theatre Workshop and was mentored by Lehman Engel. From 1974 to 1978, he showcased various BMI workshop works, such as Midnight, Apartment House (lyric by Muriel Robinson), Conversations with Pierre, Harry the Rat and Messiah on Mott Street (lyrics by David Zippel).

According to Menken, during this period, he ""worked as a ballet and modern dance accompanist, a musical director for club acts, a jingle writer, arranger, a songwriter for Sesame Street and a vocal coach"". He performed his material at clubs like The Ballroom, Reno Sweeny and Tramps.

In 1976, John Wilson reported for The New York Times that members of Engel's BMI Workshop began performing as part of the ""Broadway at the Ballroom"" series: ""The opening workshop program ... featured Maury Yeston and Alan Menken, both playing their piano accompaniment and singing songs they have written for potential musicals."" Wilson reviewed a performance at the Ballroom in 1977 where Menken accompanied a singer: ""In the current cabaret world, a piano accompanist is no longer expected to merely play piano for a singer. More and more, pianists can be heard joining in vocally, harmonizing with the singer, creating a background of shouts and exclamations or even doing brief passages of solo singing.""

Menken contributed material to revues like New York's Back in Town, Big Apple Country, The Present Tense (1977), Real Life Funnies (Off-Broadway, 1981), Diamonds (Off-Broadway, 1984), and Personals (Off-Off-Broadway, 1985). His revue Patch, Patch, Patch ran at the West Bank Cafe in New York City in 1979 and featured Chip Zien. The New York Times reviewer Mel Gussow wrote: ""The title song ... refers to a life's passage. According to Alan Menken ... after age 30 it is a downhill plunge.""

Menken wrote several shows that were not produced, including Atina, Evil Queen of the Galaxy (1980), with lyrics by Steve Brown. He also wrote The Thorn with lyrics by Brown, which was commissioned by Divine in 1980. This was a parody of the film The Rose, but they could not raise the money to have it produced. He collaborated with Howard Ashman in an uncompleted musical called Babe (c. 1981), with Tom Eyen in Kicks: The Showgirl Musical (1984), and with David Rogers in The Dream in Royal Street (c. 1981), which was an adaptation of A Midsummer Night's Dream. Menken contributed music for the film The Line (1980), directed by Robert J. Siegel.

Breakthrough years 
Menken finally achieved success as a composer when playwright Howard Ashman chose him and Engel to write the music for his musical adaptation of Kurt Vonnegut's novel God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater. The musical opened in 1979 at the WPA Theater to excellent reviews and modest box office. It transferred after several months to the Off-Broadway Entermedia Theater, where it ran for an additional six weeks.

Menken and Ashman wrote their next musical, Little Shop of Horrors, for a cast of only 9 performers, including a puppeteer. This musical is based on the 1960 black comedy film The Little Shop of Horrors. It opened at WPA Theater in 1982 to warm reviews. It moved to the Off Broadway Orpheum Theatre in the East Village, Manhattan, where it ran for five years. The musical set the box-office record for highest grossing Off-Broadway show of all time. It toured around the world, won theater awards and was adapted as a 1986 musical film starring Rick Moranis that earned Menken and Ashman their first Oscar nomination for the song ""Mean Green Mother From Outer Space"". For his body of work in musical theatre, he was awarded the BMI Career Achievement Award in 1983.

In 1987, Menken and lyricist David Spencer's adaptation The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz, based on the 1959 novel of the same name, was produced in Philadelphia. After substantial re-writes, it was produced in 2015 in Montreal. In 1992, the WPA Theatre produced Menken's Weird Romance, also with lyrics by Spencer. Menken's musical based on the Charles Dickens novella A Christmas Carol, with lyrics by Lynn Ahrens and book by Mike Ockrent, debuted at Madison Square Garden's Paramount Theater in 1994. The show proved successful and was an annual New York holiday event.

Disney Renaissance and later films 
On the strength of the success of Little Shop of Horrors, Menken and Ashman were hired by Walt Disney Studios to write the music for The Little Mermaid (1989). The challenge was to create an animated musical film of this Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale that could sit alongside the Disney films Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Cinderella. The Little Mermaid opened to critical and commercial success and signaled a new Disney era called the Disney Renaissance. The film gave them their first Oscar win: Best Song for the song ""Under the Sea"". Menken also won the 1989 Oscar for Best Score.

Menken and Ashman's Beauty and the Beast garnered them three 1991 Oscar nominations for Best Song, winning for its title song. Menken won another Oscar for Best Score. The two were working on Aladdin at the time of Ashman's death in 1991. Ashman wrote only three songs in the film and Menken collaborated with Tim Rice, who was then working The Lion King, to write the rest of the songs for the film. The film won an Oscar in 1992 for Best Song: ""A Whole New World"". Menken also won the Oscar for Best Score. Menken's live action musical film Newsies, with lyrics by Jack Feldman, was released in 1992.

Three more animated musical films followed. Menken collaborated with Stephen Schwartz for Pocahontas, for which the two won two Oscars: Best Song and Best Musical or Comedy Score. In 1996, the same musical team created the songs, and Menken, the score, for The Hunchback of Notre Dame. In 1997, Menken reunited with his early collaborator, David Zippel, for his last film in the era, Hercules.

Menken also wrote the music for the Michael J. Fox vehicle Life with Mikey (1993), the holiday film Noel (2004) and Mirror Mirror (2012). His other film scores for Disney have included Home on the Range (2004), the Tim Allen remake of The Shaggy Dog (2006), Enchanted (2007), and Tangled (2010).

In March 2017, Disney released a live-action adaptation of Beauty and the Beast, directed by Bill Condon, with the songs from the 1991 film and new material by Menken and Rice. Menken collaborated with Benj Pasek and Justin Paul on writing new songs for the 2019 live-action version of Aladdin, directed by Guy Ritchie.

Menken is also working on new music for a live-action film adaptation of The Little Mermaid, directed by Rob Marshall, with longtime The Little Mermaid fan Lin-Manuel Miranda, whom Menken knew since the former's childhood, as Miranda went to the same school as Menken's niece. Menken will also once again be working with Stephen Schwartz to write new songs for Disenchanted, the sequel to Enchanted, and for a remake of The Hunchback of Notre Dame, which Menken will score. Menken is also working alongside former Disney chief creative officer John Lasseter on a project at Skydance Animation. On May 20 2020, the project was revealed to be Vicky Jenson's Spellbound. Menken will co-write songs for Spellbound alongside Glenn Slater, with whom he worked in Home on the Range and Tangled. Menken is also reportedly attached to a sequel to Aladdin.

With eight Academy Awards, only composer Alfred Newman (nine wins) and Walt Disney (22 wins) have received more Oscars than Menken. He is tied for third place with late costume designer Edith Head, and currently holds the record for the most wins for a living person.

Return to musical theatre 
Menken debuted on Broadway with a musical theatre adaptation of Beauty and the Beast that opened in 1994 and ran for 13 years before closing in 2007. In 1997, he collaborated with lyricist Tim Rice on a musical, King David, based on the biblical character, which was performed in a concert version on Broadway at the New Amsterdam Theatre. Little Shop of Horrors played on Broadway from 2003 to 2004.

He next created the stage version of The Little Mermaid, which played on Broadway from 2008 to 2009 and for which he received a nomination for a Tony Award for Best Score. Menken's stage adaptation of Sister Act premiered in London in 2009, and opened on Broadway in 2011. He was nominated for another Tony Award for Best Score. Menken received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2010. In December 2010, he was a guest on the NPR quiz show Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!.

In 2012, Menken won a Tony Award for Best Score for his musical adaptation of Newsies, which ran until 2014. He also wrote the music for Leap of Faith, which had a brief run on Broadway in 2012. His stage adaptation of Aladdin opened on Broadway in 2014, earning him another Tony nomination for Best Score. In 2013, he was a guest at the annual Junior Theatre Festival in Atlanta, Georgia, and was honored with the Junior Theater Festival  Award. He gave a concert there, including music that was cut from various productions, while talking about his creative process.

Menken's stage adaptation of The Hunchback of Notre Dame played at La Jolla Playhouse, California, in 2014. The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz was revived in Montreal in 2015, and A Bronx Tale: The Musical played at the Paper Mill Playhouse in 2016. Menken is currently working on stage musical adaptations of Night at the Museum and Animal Farm.

As of 2019, Menken is reuniting with his Newsies creators Jack Feldman and Harvey Fierstein to develop a new musical called Greetings from Niagara Falls. A reading was held in January 2019; however, there is no word on future plans for the project at this time.

Television work 
From 1989 to 1990, Menken and Howard Ashman wrote songs for the popular puppet TV show Sesame Street. In 2008, Menken said that his work on Sesame Street was ""pathetic money, but it still had some prestige to it. It was on the air and [he] was getting some royalties"". The duo also wrote a song titled ""Wonderful Ways to Say No"" for the 1990 animated anti-drug special Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue.

In 2015, Menken co-composed the score for the musical television series Galavant alongside Christopher Lennertz, reuninting him with Tangled screenwriter Dan Fogelman. Menken also co-wrote songs for the series alongside Glenn Slater. The series lasted two seasons, first airing on January 4, 2015, and last airing on January 31, 2016. In 2017, Menken and Slater returned to write songs for the animated series Rapunzel's Tangled Adventure, which is set after the events of Tangled. The series ended in 2020, after three seasons. On July 26, 2020, Menken and Slater won the Daytime Emmy Award for Original Song in a Children's, Young Adult or Animated Program for the song titled ""Waiting in the Wings"".

Menken is currently writing songs for a prequel/spin-off series to 2017's Beauty and the Beast titled Little Town, which will be centered on Gaston and LeFou. The series will be released on Disney's streaming service, Disney+. Menken will also be an executive-producer on the series.

Personal life
Menken was introduced to ballet dancer Janis Roswick while working with the Downtown Ballet Company. They have been married since November 1972 and live in North Salem, New York. They have two daughters, Anna Menken and Nora Menken.

Walt Disney Animation Studios people"," Alan Menken (born July 22, 1949) is an American composer who has scored over 60 films and has won numerous awards, including three Academy Awards, three Golden Globes, three Grammy Awards, and a Tony Award. Menken was born in New York City, the son of Judith and Norman Menken. His father was a dentist and his mother was a stage performer who inspired his love of show business. He was raised in a Jewish household. At the age of seven, he started playing the piano, largely by ear, and soon began to write his own songs. Menken attended the High School for Performing Arts in Manhattan, and graduated from New York University with a BFA in 1971. He studied music with Paul Sayling, a concert pianist, and composition with Henry Cowell, John Corigliano, and David Diamond. He became a student of Leonard Kastle, an authority on the works of Mozart, at the Manhattan School of Music in 1971, but dropped out after three months in favor of a career in pop music. In the 1970s, Menken worked with his friend, singer-songwriter Paul Jabara, on several songs written for films, including the disco-themed movie Thank God It's Friday. Their songs, including the chart-topping ""Last Dance"" and ""Hot Stuff"", helped to popularize disco music. Together, they also wrote ""The Main Event"" for the 1980 film of the same name, which was the first time that Menken had ever worked on a film's score. Afterward, Menken began to work on Broadway, winning a Tony Award for Best Original Score for the 1981 production of Little Shop of Horrors. Menken was asked to write the songs for the film, which was released in 1986. Menken is well known for his scores to animated films, particularly his work with Disney. His scores for films such as The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin have become immensely popular and have won him three Academy Awards. His most recent work for Disney was for the 2011 film Tangled. In 2008, he worked with Disney veteran songwriter Jack Feldman on the score for the animated film Bolt, and in 2009, he worked with Feldman and his Little Mermaid co-writer, Howard Ashman, on a stage adaptation of The Little Mermaid. In 2007, Menken worked with director Tom Hooper on the film adaptation of the musical Giacomo Puccini's opera La bohème, which was released in 2009. In 2011, he worked with director Chris Weitz on an animated film of the musical The Little Mermaid, which was released in 2012. Menken's music has been performed by artists such as Placido Domingo, Luciano Pavarotti, Mariah Carey, Christina Aguilera, Mary Poppins, and numerous others. Menken was inducted as a Disney Legend in 2001. In 2006, he received the Johnny Mercer Award, the highest award that the Songwriters Hall of Fame bestows. In 2008, he received the Richard Rodgers Award for his contribution to the musical theatre.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,479161,0.10746577111857401,0.21052631578947367,0.28789180485538135,0.5093457943925234,15,17,0,0,18,1,1,0,0,1,0.2598639657148845,0.029293149702963373,0.08464512565589616,0.0343980343980344,25,2,30,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,38,1,49,1,1,1
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""François de La Rochefoucauld, Marquis de Montandre"", the article should at least have 250 words","Field Marshal François de La Rochefoucauld, Marquis de Montandre, also known as Francis de La Rochefoucauld, (September 1672 - 11 August 1739) was a British soldier, who arrived in England as a Huguenot refugee. After serving as a junior officer during the Williamite War in Ireland, he was given command of Francis du Cambon's Regiment of Foot and led his regiment in the Low Countries during the Nine Years' War . He also fought at the Siege of Badajoz and at the Battle of Alcantara during the War of the Spanish Succession. He went on to be Master General of the Ordnance in Ireland.

Military career

Born the son of Charles-Louis de La Rochefoucauld, 2nd marquis of Montandre of the Doudeauville branch of the family and Madeline-Anne de La Rochefoucauld (née Pithou), de La Rochefoucauld was brought up in France as a Roman Catholic but converted to Protestantism. After arriving in England as a Huguenot refugee in the aftermath of the Edict of Fontainebleau of 1685, La Rochefoucauld joined William III's Army and served under the Earl of Galway during the Williamite War in Ireland. He was commissioned as a brevet lieutenant colonel and given command of Francis du Cambon's Regiment of Foot on 15 February 1692. He went with his regiment to the Low Countries in September 1692 during the Nine Years' War and in 1702 succeeded his brother Isaac, who died without issue, as 4th marquis de Montandre.

La Rochefoucauld joined the staff of the Earl of Galway as a brigadier-general in 1704 and fought at the Siege of Badajoz in October 1705 and the Battle of Alcantara in April 1706 during the War of the Spanish Succession. Promoted to major-general in the English Army on 1 June 1706, he took part in the advance to Madrid in June 1706 and became colonel of Dungannon's Regiment in November 1706. He was given command of a brigade which landed in Portugal in June 1707 and led the brigade at the Battle of Caya in May 1709. On 29 September 1709 de La Rochefoucauld returned to London to report to Queen Anne on the course of operations in Portugal. Promoted to lieutenant general on 9 May 1710, he became colonel of a new regiment on the Irish establishment in 1715 but this regiment was disbanded in 1718.

La Rochefoucauld was appointed a Privy Counsellor of Ireland and became Master General of the Ordnance in Ireland in January 1727. Promoted to full general on 18 December 1735, he became Governor of Guernsey in September 1737. He was promoted to field marshal on 2 July 1739. He died at his home in Grosvenor Square in London on 11 August 1739 and was buried in Westminster Abbey. A new stone, quarried in Montendre and brought to London at the expense of the present Duc de La Rochefoucauld-Doudeauville, was placed over his grave on 15 January 2013.

Family
In April 1710 de La Rochefoucauld married Mary Anne von Spanheim, daughter of Ezekiel, Freiherr von Spanheim (the Prussian ambassador to London); they had no children.

La Rochefoucauld was born in Paris, the son of Etienne de La Rochefoucauld, a fidalgo, or member of the nobility of the household of the King of France, and of Judith de Lencel, daughter of a Protestant family from the south of France. His mother was the sister of the mathematician and physicist Étienne Pascal. After his father's death in 1629, he and his mother and brother lived with their cousin, the philosopher and mathematician Blaise Pascal. Pascal had a great influence on La Rochefoucauld and his writing. La Rochefoucauld attended the University of Paris and completed his studies in 1633. He then served as an officer in the French army until 1646. He married his first wife, Catherine de Ligneris, in 1644, and his second wife, Jacqueline de La Vergenne, in 1651. He became the Marquis de Montandre in 1666. Montandre had many friends and acquaintances among the literary and intellectual elite of his day, including the writers Molière, La Fontaine, and Jean de Santeuil; the historians Louis de Beaufort and Louis Bergeron; and the philosophers Thomas Hobbes, René Descartes, and Nicolas Malebranche. His first published work was a collection of Latin poems, entitled La Lyre des Amants (The Lyre of Lovers), which appeared in 1639. His maxims were first published in 1665, under the title Les Maximes du Marquis de Montandre, but were later renamed Les Maximes de la Rochefoucauld. The maxims are a collection of approximately 500 epigrammatic statements that express such ideas as ""Vanity is the foundation of all wisdom"" and ""We would often be cured of our passions if we could have them at will."" The maxims have been compared to the philosophy of the ancient Greek historian Thucydides and the ancient Roman philosopher Seneca. La Rochefoucauld's work had a profound impact on the literature of the 17th century, and his maxims are often quoted in modern times.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,407516,0.0787623066104079,0.12631578947368421,0.26055364339717,0.29439252336448596,3,4,1,0,4,1,1,1,0,1,0.16263312218884948,0.0410912336053912,0.0031759182546257938,0.045454545454545456,3,1,7,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,6,1,9,1,1,1

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Alexis-François Rio"", the article should at least have 250 words","Alexis-François Rio (20 May 1797 – 17 June 1874) was a French writer on art. Without any strict method or criticism, he expressed preference for the art of the 15th century. He contributed greatly towards recovery of the neglected art of the Middle Ages.

Life
Rio was born in Island of Arz, Morbihan, Bretagne.

He was educated at the college of Vannes, where he received his first appointment as instructor, which occupation however proved to be distasteful. He proceeded to Paris, but was temporarily disappointed in his hope of obtaining there a chair of history.

His enthusiastic championship of the liberty of the Greeks attracted the attention of the Government, which appointed him censor of the public press. His refusal of this appointment won him great popularity and the lifelong friendship of Charles Forbes René de Montalembert. In 1828 he published his first work, ""Essai sur l'histoire de l'esprit humain dans l'antiquité"", which brought him the favour of the minister Auguste de La Ferronays and a secretariate in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This position allowed him (as Montalembert later wrote to him) to become for Christian, what Winckelmann had been for ancient, art.

He spent the greater portion of the period 1830-60 in travels through Italy, Germany, and England. In Munich he became acquainted with the spokesmen of contemporary Catholicism - Sulpiz Boisserée, Franz Xaver Baader, Ignaz von Döllinger, Joseph Görres, and Karl Friedrich von Rumohr - and also with Friedrich Schelling. Schelling gave him an insight into the aesthetic ideal; Rumohr directed him to Italy, where the realization of this ideal in art could be seen.

After contact with the Pre-Raphaelites of England, where he lived for three years and married, and especially of Montalembert's encouragement, he visited again, in company with his wife, all the important galleries of Europe, although he had meanwhile become lame and had to drag himself through the museums on crutches.

Works

In 1835 the first volume of his Art chrétien appeared under the misleading title, De la poésie chrétienne - Forme de l'art. This work, which was received with enthusiasm in Germany and Italy, was a complete failure in France. Discouraged, he renounced art study and wrote a history of the persecutions of the English Catholics, a work which was never printed.

Prominent men like Gladstone, Manzoni, and Thiers became interested in his studies, which he published in four volumes under the title ""L'art chrétien"" (1861-7). This work is not a history of all Christian art, but of Italian painting from Cimabue to the death of Raphael.

Rio describes the more notable incidents of his life in the two works, Histoire d'un collège Breton sous l'Empire, la petite chouannerie (1842) and Epilogue à l'art chrétien (2 vols., 1872). He also published the following works: Shakespeare (1864), in which he claims the dramatist as a Catholic; Michel-Ange et Raphael (1867); L'idéal antique et l'idéal chrétien (1873).

French male non-fiction writers"," Alexis-François Rio (10 October 1682 – 18 November 1747) was a French sculptor and painter, who spent most of his life in Rome, where he was a founding member of the Academy of Saint Luke. Alexis-François Rio was born in Uzès, in the Cévennes, the son of a sculptor. He studied under his father and then under his uncle, the sculptor Pierre Le Mercier, in Paris, and then in Rome under Carlo Maratta and Giuseppe Bartolomeo Chiari, who had just completed the sculptures on the fountain of the Four Rivers in the Piazza Navona. In 1704 he completed the marble bas-relief of The Annunciation for the Cathedral of Notre-Dame in Avignon. In 1705 he returned to Rome, where he was one of the founding members of the Academy of Saint Luke. In 1708 he was commissioned by the Duke of Parma to execute a series of marble reliefs for the chapel of the cathedral of Parma, works that were never delivered because the duke died suddenly. In 1716 he completed the statue of St. Anne for the parish church of his native Uzès, a work commissioned by his confessor, the Abbé du Chaffaut, prior to the latter's appointment as bishop of Uzès. In 1737 he completed a statue of St. Peter for the cathedral of Albi. His works include several easel paintings, mainly oil on canvas, including a Self-Portrait (1703, private collection), a View of Rome (1704, private collection), a Still Life with Fruit and Flowers (1706, private collection), and The Assumption of Mary (1710, private collection).",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,16959316,0.04339963833634718,0.06315789473684211,0.14732024660539358,0.1542056074766355,5,8,1,0,5,1,1,0,0,1,0.08698199553640469,0.046833757782142785,0.0027616680475006906,0.04791154791154791,3,0,5,5,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,1,13,1,1,1

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""NDUFAF5"", the article should at least have 250 words","NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex assembly factor 5, also known as Arginine-hydroxylase NDUFAF5, or Putative methyltransferase NDUFAF5, is a protein that in humans is encoded by the NDUFAF5 gene. The NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex (complex I) of the mitochondrial respiratory chain catalyzes the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, and consists of at least 43 subunits. The complex is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. This gene encodes a mitochondrial protein that is associated with the matrix face of the mitochondrial inner membrane and is required for complex I assembly. A mutation in this gene results in mitochondrial complex I deficiency. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

Structure 
NDUFAF5 is located on the p arm of Chromosome 20 in position 12.1 and spans 36,554 base pairs. The NDUFAF5 gene produces a 30 kDa protein composed of 267 amino acids. The presumed structure of the c-terminal of the protein has been found to resemble that of the known secondary structure of RdmB. NDUFAF5 contains the S-adenosylmethionine dependent methyltransferase domain, which contains the GxGxG signature sequence, and the S-adenosylmethionine-binding motif which are common in most SAM-dependent methyltransferases. This arginine-hydroxylase is involved in the assembly of mitochondrial NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex (complex I, MT-ND1) at early stages. Complex I is composed of 45 evolutionally conserved core subunits, including both mitochondrial DNA and nuclear encoded subunits. One of its arms is embedded in the inner membrane of the mitochondria, and the other is embedded in the organelle. The two arms are arranged in an L-shaped manner. The total molecular weight of the complex is 1MDa.

Function 
The NDUFAF5 gene encodes a mitochondrial protein that is associated with the matrix face of the mitochondrial inner membrane and is required for complex I assembly. Their role is integral to co-factor insertions and in utilizing sub-assemblies for building complex I. It does so by catalyzing the hydroxylation of Arg-73 in the NDUFS7 subunit of human complex I, which occurs before the peripheral and membrane arm juncture formation in the beginning stages of complex I assembly. The NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex (complex I) of the mitochondrial respiratory chain catalyzes the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, and consists of at least 43 subunits. The complex is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Though the exact biochemical function of NDUFAF5 is not yet known, mutations in this gene results in mitochondrial complex I deficiency. NDUFAF5 is also known to be a member of the 7β-strand family of SAM-dependent methyltransferases.

Clinical significance 
Mutations in NDUFAF5 is known to result in mitochondrial diseases and associated disorders. It is majorly associated with a complex I deficiency, a deficiency in the first complex of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Suppression of the NDUFAF5 gene has been found to lead to the loss of both peripheral and membrane arms of complex I associated with NDUFS7 and ND1. This then leads to the progressive loss of complex I, causing the deficiency. Such disorders involving the dysfunction of the mitochondrial respiratory chain may cause a wide range of clinical manifestations from lethal neonatal disease to adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders. Phenotypes include macrocephaly with progressive leukodystrophy, non-specific encephalopathy, cardiomyopathy, myopathy, liver disease, Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, and some forms of Parkinson disease. Mutations in NDUFAF5 has also been common patients with Leigh syndrome, an early-onset progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the presence of focal, bilateral lesions.

Interactions 
In addition to co-subunits for complex I, NDUFAF5 has protein-protein interactions with NDUFAF8 (for stabilization), and NDUFS7.

Human proteins
Genes on human chromosome 20"," NDUFAF5 is a gene that encodes a protein that is essential for the assembly of the ubiquinone (coenzyme Q10) pathway. Mutations in this gene are associated with Leigh syndrome and mitochondrial complex I deficiency. The gene is located on the mitochondrial DNA, which is inherited maternally. The NDUFAF5 protein is a small transmembrane protein that is essential for the assembly of complex I, a large multiprotein complex found in the mitochondrial inner membrane that is involved in the first step of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway, which is the main source of energy for the cell. The NDUFAF5 protein is thought to be involved in the assembly and stability of complex I. Mutations in the NDUFAF5 gene can cause Leigh syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that affects the brain and other parts of the body. Leigh syndrome is characterized by developmental delay, muscle weakness, and an increased risk of infection. In some cases, Leigh syndrome can be caused by mutations in the NDUFAF5 gene and in other cases it can be caused by mutations in other genes that encode proteins that are involved in the assembly of complex I. Mitochondrial complex I deficiency is a condition that can be caused by mutations in the NDUFAF5 gene. Mitochondrial complex I deficiency is characterized by a lack of energy production, which can lead to muscle weakness, a lack of growth, and an increased risk of infection.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,58004903,0.1350210970464135,0.05263157894736842,0.2685552907951637,0.11682242990654206,4,5,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0.14491244742951057,0.05019369435756275,0.0011046672190002762,0.042997542997543,7,0,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,6,1,9,1,1,1

The UAB Blazers men's soccer team''' is an intercollegiate varsity sports program at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. The college soccer program competes in Conference USA of NCAA Division I.

History 

UAB began a men's soccer program back in 1979. Throughout its history, UAB has enjoyed great success in the men's soccer program. The men's team has been in the NCAA Tournament a total of 7 times including 2 Sweet Sixteen appearances and 1 Elite Eight appearance in 1999. The men's team has been ranked nationally numerous times throughout its history, including top 25 rankings in 16 of the last 18 seasons. One of UAB's biggest wins in the men's team history came when UAB upset the #1-ranked UCLA Bruins in 1997 by a score of 2–0. UAB would upset another #1-ranked team in 2006 when they beat the SMU Mustangs by a score of 2–1.

Stadium 

The men's team began to play to play their home games at UAB's BBVA Field (originally BBVA Compass Field) in 2015. Prior to this, the Blazers played at their old venue, West Campus Field.

Since 1993, the men's team has won nearly 80% of its games played at West Campus Field.  UAB has frequently been among the national leaders in soccer attendance, finishing as high as 16th nationally in average attendance. The highest attended home soccer game in UAB history came in 2011 when 3,141 fans saw the Blazers defeat Clemson 2–1.

Fans 

Although many traditions, cheers, and chants take place at each home game, there is one that ""stands above the rest,"" according to former head coach Mike Getman. Led by alumni super-fan Andrew Robillard, who has not missed a UAB men's home soccer match in 22 seasons, the whole student section sings ""God Bless America"" in unity. The Hillsborough Times has reported this tradition as one of its ""12 College Sports Traditions you Don't Want to Miss.""

History 
Palace is situated between the white marble Khas Mahal and the red stone Jahangiri Mahal and is set, transitionally, in between these two major residential complexes of two different ages. It is the earliest attempt of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan to convert an existing redstone building in accordance with his taste. It is his earliest palace in Agra Fort and has a large hall and side rooms, and an octagonal tower on the river side.

The skeletal construction of the brick masonry and red stone were all white, stuccoed with a thick plaster and colourfully painted with floral designs. The whole palace once glistened white, like white marble.

On its face towards the Khas Mahal is a white marble dalan, composed of five nine-cusped arches supported on double pillars and protected externally by a Chhajja. Its western bay was closed to house the Ghaznin gate. Babur's baoli and well are situated beneath it. The subterranean apartments in several stories are also situated under this palace.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""John Isner"", the article should at least have 250 words","John Robert Isner (born April 26, 1985) is an American professional tennis player. He has been ranked as high as No. 8 in men's singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP).

Considered one of the best servers ever to play on the ATP Tour, Isner achieved his career-high singles ranking in July 2018 by virtue of his maiden Masters 1000 crown at the 2018 Miami Open and a semifinals appearance at the 2018 Wimbledon Championships. He has also twice reached the quarterfinals at the US Open in 2011 and 2018, the latter of which helped qualify him for his first ATP Finals appearance later that year. He currently has the second-most aces in the history of the ATP Tour, having served over 13,000 aces. At the 2010 Wimbledon Championships, he played the longest professional tennis match in history, defeating Nicolas Mahut in a total of 11 hours and 5 minutes, played over the course of three days. Isner currently holds the record for hitting the ATP's fastest ""official"" serve ever and third-fastest on record in tennis at  during his first-round 2016 Davis Cup match. On 17 August 2021 at the 2021 Western & Southern Open, he became the second player in the world to reach 13,000 aces on the most aces in career list, joining Ivo Karlovic.

Professional career

2007–2008: Turning pro, First ATP final, top 100

Isner began his professional career in earnest in the summer of 2007. With a world ranking of no. 839, he needed a wildcard entry into the main draws of every single tournament, even at Futures level.

He won his first tournament of the summer, the USA F14 Futures, beating the top three seeds along the way. Then, after first-round losses at Challenger level as well as a tournament at ATP level, he beat five top-300 players and three seeds to win the Lexington Challenger in July and improve his ranking to no. 416 after just one month.

At the following week's tournament at the Legg Mason Tennis Classic in Washington, D.C., a late withdrawal freed up a wildcard spot, which was given to Isner at the last minute. Isner took full advantage of his good fortune, recording his first wins over top-100 players. He won third-set tiebreakers on five consecutive days, beating no. 73 Tim Henman, no. 47 Benjamin Becker, no. 189 qualifier Wayne Odesnik, no. 12 Tommy Haas, and no. 54 Gaël Monfils, to reach the final, where he fell to fellow American Andy Roddick. His week raised his ranking to no. 193 in the world after six weeks on the pro tour.

Isner's success in Washington, D.C. earned him wildcard entries into three more ATP tournaments—the Masters 1000 Series event in Cincinnati a week later, New Haven and the US Open. He lost in the first round in Cincinnati to quarterfinalist no. 15 David Ferrer.

He was defeated in the first round of the 2008 Australian Open by veteran Fabrice Santoro of France. Teamed with Croat Ivo Karlović, who stands half an inch taller (Karlović is currently the joint tallest player on the ATP World Tour alongside Reilly Opelka), Isner also lost in the first round of doubles.

The victory in Auckland was Isner's first ATP tour title; after the victory he donated $5,000 of his winnings to aid rescue action for the 2010 Haiti earthquake.

The victory catapulted Isner into the top 30 for the first time and also allowed him to surpass Sam Querrey to become the second-highest-ranked American for the first time, behind only Andy Roddick. Isner said he intended to finish the year in the top 20, and given his ascendency in the world rankings combined with the absence of Roddick and James Blake for the 2010 Davis Cup season, it became increasingly likely that Isner would qualify to play singles for the United States Davis Cup team for the first time in his career.

After Gilles Simon withdrew, Isner became the final seed for the 2010 Australian Open. In the first round, he defeated world no. 49 Andreas Seppi for his first victory at the Australian Open and his first victory at a Grand Slam other than the US Open. He then advanced to the round of 16, before losing to world no. 4 and eventual finalist Andy Murray.

After the Australian Open, Davis Cup captain Patrick McEnroe announced that Isner and Querrey would be first and second singles selections on the United States Davis Cup team's first-round World Group tie in Serbia on indoor clay in March 2010; Isner described the selection as ""a dream come true"".

However, he teamed with Querrey to reach the doubles final in Rome, before losing to Bob and Mike Bryan; his doubles performance raised his doubles ranking to the top 30 for the first time.

His next tournament was the 2010 Serbian Open, where he was the second seed behind defending champion, tournament host and world no. 2 Djokovic. Isner advanced to the first clay-court final of his career, third final of the year, and fourth final of his career.

In doubles, he and Querrey were the 12th seeds, but withdrew prior to the start of the tournament after Querrey's first-round loss in singles.

Despite being ranked no. 19 in the world entering Wimbledon, Isner was seeded 24th by the tournament committee due to his lack of experience on grass, but was moved up to 23rd following the withdrawal of Radek Štěpánek. In the first round, Isner played Nicolas Mahut in the longest match in tennis history, prevailing 6–4, 3–6, 6–7, 7–6, 70–68.

Although Isner was found to have suffered ligament damage to the ankle, he chose not to withdraw from the US Open singles tournament.

At the 2010 US Open, Isner was 18th seed and defeated Frederico Gil in the first round. After the match he revealed that although the initial diagnosis was a right ankle ligament tear, a second opinion revealed that the damage was a strain and not a tear, and he declared his ankle 90% healed. He then advanced to the third round, before losing to 12th seed and 2006 US Open semifinalist Mikhail Youzhny. The loss dropped Isner out of the top 20 and from the no. 2 to the no. 4 ranked American player. Due to his ankle injury, he chose not to compete in doubles.

He continued such form into the Australian Open reaching the third round before having to retire with a foot injury during the second set against former champion Stan Wawrinka.

It would be a month later that Isner recorded his next win, advancing to the semifinals of the Mexican Open before the hiatus of the COVID-19 pandemic stopped the ATP tour until the Cincinnati Masters, where he lost in the third round against Stefanos Tsitsipas in straight sets.

2021: Sixth Atlanta title, thirteenth Masters semifinal, out of and return to top 30
In April, John Isner could not defend his points from the previous final at the 2021 Miami Open and dropped out of the top 30 for the first time in 10 years. Even though he reached the quarterfinals at the 2021 Mutua Madrid Open, Isner still remained out of the top 30. With this drop in the rankings, it also marked the first time there were no American men players in the Top 30 in the nearly half-century of computerized tennis rankings on May 10, 2021.

At the 2021 French Open, Isner reached the third round, losing to eventual finalist Stefanos Tsitsipas in four sets.

In July 2021 he won his sixth ATP doubles title at the 2021 Los Cabos Open partnering Hans Hach Verdugo as wildcards.

At the 2021 Atlanta Open, Isner beat Brandon Nakashima to win a record sixth title in his ninth finals appearance at the event.

At the Canadian Open, Isner made it to the semifinals defeating many seeded players along the way such as 13th seed Cristian Garín, 4th seed Andrey Rublev, and 11th seed Gaël Monfils. He lost in the semifinals to top seed Daniil Medvedev in straight sets. His performance at the tournament would push his ranking back into the top 30 to world No. 26 on August 16, 2021.

Longest matches in Grand Slam history (2010, 2018)
Isner has also earned a reputation for competing in extremely even, long duration matches and holds the unique distinction of having been a competitor in the longest and second-longest matches in a major tournament in history. The first was the now-legendary opening-round match at the 2010 Wimbledon Championships when Isner defeated Nicolas Mahut in 11 hours and 5 minutes in a match played over three separate days. The second-longest match in major tournament history was Isner's loss to South African Kevin Anderson in the first men's semifinal at the 2018 Wimbledon Championships.

The longest match in history: Isner v Mahut, June 22–24, 2010

At the 2010 Wimbledon Championships, Isner faced qualifier Nicolas Mahut in the first round. Isner won the match 6–4, 3–6, 6–7, 7–6, 70–68.

The final set alone was longer than the previous longest match.

In the match, Isner set the record for the most aces served in a match, breaking Ivo Karlović's record of 78; Mahut passed the old mark as well. Isner set a new record of 113 aces, ahead of the 103 aces served by Mahut.

The first four sets were played on June 22. At 21:13 BST on June 23 the match was suspended due to darkness for a second day at 59–59 in the fifth set. The match resumed on June 24, at 15:30 BST, starting the third day of the match. Overall, the match lasted eleven hours and five minutes. Isner also set the record for the most games won in a Wimbledon match with 92.

The match brought Isner a measure of fame, particularly in the United Kingdom and his native United States. He had guest appearances on Good Morning America and the Late Show with David Letterman, and threw the ceremonial first pitch at a New York Yankees game in Yankee Stadium. He and Mahut won the 2010 ESPY Award for Best Record-Breaking Performance in sport.

The second-longest match: Isner v Anderson, July 13, 2018

This match saw Isner face similarly big-serving Kevin Anderson of South Africa. The match is the longest tennis match ever in the second week of a Grand Slam tournament, both by time and number of games played. It is also the longest-ever match on Centre Court, and the fourth-longest tennis match of all time.

The first three sets were all decided by tiebreakers, the first going to Anderson and both the second and third going to Isner. In the fourth set Anderson exploited an opening and broke Isner's serve to make the score 7–6, 6–7, 6–7, 6–4 going into a fifth set in which Anderson seemed to have gained significant momentum from his service break. The fifth quickly became a battle of services as both players began to tire. At 16–17 it began to rain, leading to speculation of a delay to close the Centre Court roof, but the rain stopped during the crossover break. Isner endured a shaky mistake which permitted Anderson to get back in the game to 40–30 from 40–0 down, but Isner forced Anderson to miss the next backhand return and held serve. At 24–24, Anderson built up a 0–40 lead and while Isner got back two of those points to bring the score to 30–40, Anderson broke Isner on his third break point of the game, and served out to win the match in 6 hours and 36 minutes, with the scoreline reading 7–6, 6–7, 6–7, 6–4, 26–24.

Playing style and equipment
Isner has an extremely powerful and consistent serve, thanks in part to his 6-foot-10½-inch height which makes him the third-tallest player on tour behind Ivo Karlović and Reilly Opelka. Commentators have also praised his composure; in five consecutive third-set tiebreaker wins in Washington, D.C., he delivered huge serves when it mattered most. Isner also has a very powerful forehand, which he uses in tandem with his serve. Isner will often go for one-two points: a big serve followed up by a big forehand. He is also known to back up his serves with approaches to the net, though he does not strictly serve-and-volley. Isner's movement around the court is hampered by his body and he is hurt by players that move him around the court. Isner's fitness has improved considerably throughout the years, as he displayed during his win in the longest tennis match ever at Wimbledon against Nicolas Mahut.

Because of his style of play, that consists of a big, consistent serve, he often ends up winning a great majority of his service games. But at the same time, due to poor movement around the court, he often finds it difficult to break the opponent's serve, especially those players that move him around the court. This often finds him involved in long matches where each player continues holding serve until the set reaches the tiebreak. At Grand Slams where there are no fifth-set tiebreaks (since 2019 only Roland Garros, but before also Wimbledon and the Australian Open), his matches can extend very long, as evidenced by the fact that he was a player in the two longest-ever Grand Slam matches, both at Wimbledon in 2010 and 2018, respectively.

As of January 2012, Isner was sponsored by Lacoste and Prince for his attire and rackets, respectively. His attire carried through most of 2015. He switched his attire to FILA in 2016 at the Australian Open.

Coaches
Isner's first coach was Craig Boynton, who worked with him from 2009 to 2012 and helped develop his style of play. Isner and Boynton split over reportedly mutual agreement. Isner then hired Mike Sell, who helped him to significant success, such as defeating Roger Federer, David Nalbandian and Novak Djokovic. During his time with Sell, Isner's ranking stayed around no. 10 in the world. After parting from Sell in 2014, Isner teamed with Justin Gimelstob and worked with him until April 2016. With Gimelstob, Isner's ranking stayed around 10, until 2016, where he dropped to 17. As of 2018, he is currently working with coaches Rene Moller and David Macpherson.

Personal life
Isner is the youngest of three boys. He started playing tennis seriously at age 11. He is a graduate of Walter Hines Page Senior High School, in Greensboro, and the University of Georgia, where he majored in speech communication. He resided in Tampa, Florida, where he trained at the Saddlebrook Academy alongside other American tennis pros such as James Blake and Mardy Fish. Currently, he resides in Dallas, Texas.

Isner married Madison McKinley, a jewelry designer, on December 2, 2017, in Bluffton, South Carolina. They have three children.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Wolseley Battery"", the article should at least have 250 words","Wolseley Battery () is an artillery battery in Delimara, Marsaxlokk, Malta. It was built by the British between 1897 and 1899, and is located close to Fort Tas-Silġ. Today, the battery still exists, but it is not accessible to the public.

History
The Wolseley Battery is nicknamed by locals as Tal-Basal, meaning ""of the onions"". It was built between 1897 and 1899 to defend the area stretching from Delimara Point to Xrobb l-Għaġin. It formed part of a new series of fortifications meant to house breech-loading (BL) guns. The 18th century Tombrell Battery was demolished in the 19th century to clear Wolseley Battery's line of fire.

The battery has an oval plan with four gun emplacements, which originally contained two 9.2 inch and two 6 inch BL guns. The gun emplacements are surrounded by a shallow ditch, which was originally defended by barbed wire entanglements. The rear of the battery was sealed off by an iron fence. The battery also had machine gun emplacements, and it was the first fortification in Malta to have these features.

Wolseley Battery became obsolete by 1906, and its 6-inch guns were transferred to the newly built Wardija Battery near St. Paul's Bay in 1915. The battery was fully decommissioned a year later in 1916.

A stone-clad pillbox was built behind the officers' quarters in the 1930s.

Present day
Today, the battery still exists, but there is no public access since it is private property. It is located close to the Delimara Power Station.

In 2015, the battery was shortlisted as a possible site for the campus of the proposed American University of Malta. It was not chosen, and the campus was split up between Dock No. 1 in Cospicua and Żonqor Point in Marsaskala.

19th-century fortifications"," The Wolseley Battery was a group of wealthy Englishmen, mostly shareholders in the Wolseley Motors Limited car manufacturing company, who between 1907 and 1933 played an influential role in the development of British motor sport. The group was founded by Charles Stewart Rolls, the co-founder of Rolls-Royce, who also served as its chairman. Its other members included the Duke of Norfolk, Lord de Clifford, Lord Howard de Walden, Lord Glentworth, the Earl of Ancaster, Lord Malcolm, the Duke of Westminster, Lord Castlemaine, Sir Henry Birkin, and Charles Needell, the founder of the Veteran Car Club of Great Britain. The Wolseley Battery's main activities were the financing and sponsorship of various racing drivers and teams, including those of the young British driver Parry Thomas, who won the 24 Hours of Le Mans race in 1928, and the Scottish driver Sir Henry Birkin, who won the race in 1929. The Wolseley Battery also had a close relationship with the Royal Automobile Club (RAC), and for many years sponsored the RAC's International Grand Prix at Brooklands, and provided the winner's trophy, which was known as the Wolseley Cup. The Battery's activities eventually came to an end with the bankruptcy of Wolseley Motors in 1933.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,46963530,0.06751054852320673,0.031578947368421054,0.13817550672197218,0.06697819314641744,2,5,0,0,3,1,1,0,0,1,0.12412937861742576,0.047084891659114364,0.00041425020712510354,0.036855036855036855,3,0,0,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,1,7,1,1,1
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""1922 Lithuanian parliamentary election"", the article should at least have 250 words","Parliamentary elections were held in Lithuania on 10 and 11 October 1922, and elected 78 members of the First Seimas of Lithuania. This was the first election held in Lithuania under the democratic 1922 Constitution, adopted by the Constituent Assembly of Lithuania on 1 August 1922.

38 out of 78 seats were won by a bloc of parties led by the Christian Democrats, and they acquired both the positions of President and Prime Minister, occupied by Aleksandras Stulginskis and Ernestas Galvanauskas respectively. In both cases, however, the Christian Democrats were not supported by any party in the opposition and could only form a minority government. Unable to work with such a makeup, the First Seimas was dissolved on 12 March 1923.

Electoral system
The law on the conduct of Seimas elections was promulgated by the Constituent Assembly on 19 July 1922, and published in the official newspaper of the government, ""Vyriausybės žinios"" (Government News) on 27 July 1922. Elections were universal, free and secret, and all citizens of Lithuania, both men and women over 21 years old, were allowed to vote. Citizens 24 years old or older were allowed to stand for election.

The elections were held with party-list proportional representation, in nine multi-member constituencies. In practice, only six of the nine defined constituencies held elections, as Constituencies VII, VIII and IX were allocated to territories occupied by Poland during the Polish–Lithuanian War in 1920. Their centers were Vilnius, Lida and Hrodna respectively.

Parties and electoral groups (kuopa) were allowed to submit lists of candidates to constituencies, which had to be signed by at least fifty voters. As such, there was a large number of small electoral lists in every constituency. However, the method of calculating the distribution of seats in each constituency benefited larger parties, as such, the only non-party electoral group which managed to gain seats were lists submitted by the underground Communist Party of Lithuania.

Competing parties
The largest and most active electoral alliance in the election was the Christian Democratic Bloc, formed from the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party and two satellite organizations - Labour Federation, which represented Catholic workers, and Farmers' Association, which represented Catholic peasantry. The Christian Democratic Bloc was strongly supported by the Lithuanian priesthood, which had a strong influence in the agrarian and less literate countryside, and numerous priests were a part of their electoral lists.

However, the Christian Democrats were isolated in the political arena. Historically, LKDP evolved from a different stream of the Lithuanian National Revival than all of their competitors - the Peasant Union, Social Democrats and Party of National Progress (later the Lithuanian Nationalist Union). All of them evolved from the secular nationalist newspaper Varpas, while the Christian Democrats evolved around the Catholic periodical Tėvynės sargas.

The alliance of the Peasant Union and Popular Socialist Party presented itself as socialist and campaigned for the lifting of martial law and secularization. Though the main targets of the criticism were Christian Democrats and National Progress, they were also in opposition to the Social Democrats. The Social Democrats presented their electoral campaign as the first step towards a peaceful socialist revolution and campaigned for a ""Seimas of the workers"". All political parties supported the land reforms put in place by the Constituent Assembly, and oftentimes argued that their competitors will be the ones to roll back the reform.

Separate electoral lists by the Polish, Jewish and Russian minorities also competed in the election.

Results

Aftermath
Though the Christian Democratic Bloc achieved a plurality of the seats, they were unable to form a majority coalition, nor did the opposition parties manage to unite against them. The next President and Prime Minister were thus elected via violations of electoral conduct. Protesting against the Christian Democrats, the opposition parties refused to participate in the election of Aleksandras Stulginskis and he was elected solely with Christian Democratic votes. Two governments led by independent politician Ernestas Galvanauskas were formed, but in both cases they were approved with 38 votes in favor and 38 votes against (2 members of the Seimas did not participate), which the opposition criticized as illegal.

The formed government was unstable and the First Seimas was dissolved on 12 March 1923.

The Left Banke albums
Mercury Records compilation albums"," There's Gonna Be a Storm: The Complete Recordings 1966–1969 is a box set by American rock band the Chambers Brothers, released in August 2002 on the Hip-O Records label. The set consists of the three albums the group recorded for Columbia Records, as well as a fourth disc comprising outtakes and previously unreleased material. The albums included in the set are the group's debut, People Get Ready (1966), their only Top 10 album, Electric Trains to Mars (1968), and their final studio effort, Back in the USA (1969). The bonus disc, ""Live in the Fifties and Sixties"", contains live material from the group's early years, as well as studio outtakes from the albums. There's Gonna Be a Storm was produced by Billy Baker, who also wrote the liner notes. The set was issued in a slipcase with a 24-page book, and included a sticker sheet with promotional images and lyrics. The collection was issued after the death of lead singer Lester Chambers in October 2020. The Chambers Brothers' music was influenced by gospel music, blues, and R&B, and the group became known for their distinct, close harmonies, as well as guitarist George Chambers' innovative use of electronic effects. The group's debut album, People Get Ready, was released in 1966, and featured the single ""People Get Ready"", which became the group's first big hit. The band's second album, Electric Trains to Mars, was released in 1968, and included the song ""Time Has Come Today"", which became their highest-charting single. The group's final studio effort, Back in the USA, was released in 1969, and featured the song ""Are You Ready"", which became their last big hit. After the group's initial success, they began to struggle with drug addiction, and their music became heavier and more psychedelic. The Chambers Brothers were among the first groups to use fuzz guitar and feedback, and their music has been described as a precursor to the heavy metal and grunge genres. The group's music was also influenced by the civil rights movement, and their songs often featured social and political themes.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,33002105,0.016877637130801683,0.11578947368421053,0.1668873003265378,0.2897196261682243,1,3,1,0,2,1,1,1,0,1,0.08163251205108218,0.024614119179372358,0.04059652029826015,0.02702702702702703,5,0,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3,1,9,1,1,1
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Monarchy in Nova Scotia"", the article should at least have 250 words","By the arrangements of the Canadian federation, the Canadian monarchy operates in Nova Scotia as the core of the province's Westminster-style parliamentary democracy. As such, the Crown within Nova Scotia's jurisdiction is referred to as the Crown in Right of Nova Scotia, Her Majesty in Right of Nova Scotia, or the Queen in Right of Nova Scotia. The Constitution Act, 1867, however, leaves many royal duties in Nova Scotia specifically assigned to the sovereign's viceroy, the Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia, whose direct participation in governance is limited by the conventional stipulations of constitutional monarchy.

Constitution

The role of the Crown is both legal and practical; it functions in Nova Scotia in the same way it does in all of Canada's other provinces, being the centre of a constitutional construct in which the institutions of government acting under the sovereign's authority share the power of the whole. It is thus the foundation of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the province's government. The Canadian monarch—since 6 February 1952, Queen Elizabeth II—is represented and her duties carried out by the Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia, whose direct participation in governance is limited by the conventional stipulations of constitutional monarchy, with most related powers entrusted for exercise by the elected parliamentarians, the ministers of the Crown generally drawn from amongst them, and the judges and justices of the peace. The Crown today primarily functions as a guarantor of continuous and stable governance and a nonpartisan safeguard against the abuse of power. This arrangement began with the 1867 British North America Act and continued an unbroken line of monarchical government extending back to the late 16th century. However, though Nova Scotia has a separate government headed by the Queen, as a province, Nova Scotia is not itself a kingdom.

Government House in Halifax is owned by the sovereign in her capacity as Queen in Right of Nova Scotia and is used as an official residence both by the lieutenant governor and the sovereign and other members of the Canadian Royal Family will reside there when in Nova Scotia.

Royal associations

Those in the Royal Family perform ceremonial duties when on a tour of the province; the royal persons do not receive any personal income for their service, only the costs associated with the exercise of these obligations are funded by both the Canadian and Nova Scotia Crowns in their respective councils. Monuments around Nova Scotia mark some of those visits, while others honour a royal personage or event. Further, Nova Scotia's monarchical status is illustrated by royal names applied regions, communities, schools, and buildings, many of which may also have a specific history with a member or members of the Royal Family. Associations also exist between the Crown and many private organizations within the province; these may have been founded by a Royal Charter, received a royal prefix, and/or been honoured with the patronage of a member of the Royal Family. Examples include the Royal Nova Scotia International Tattoo, which is under the patronage of Queen Elizabeth II and received its royal prefix from her in 2006.

The main symbol of the monarchy is the sovereign herself, her image (in portrait or effigy) thus being used to signify government authority. A royal cypher or crown may also illustrate the monarchy as the locus of authority, without referring to any specific monarch. Further, though the monarch does not form a part of the constitutions of Nova Scotia's honours, they do stem from the Crown as the fount of honour, and so bear on the insignia symbols of the sovereign.

History

Nova Scotia's first monarchical connections were formed when Jacques Cartier in 1534 claimed Chaleur Bay for King Francis I, though the area was not officially settled until King Henry IV in 1604 established a colony administered by the Governor of Acadia. Only slightly later, King James VI and I laid claim to what is today Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and part of Maine and made it part of the Scottish Crown's dominion, calling the area Nova Scotia. James' son, Charles I, later issued the Charter of New Scotland, which created the Baronets of Nova Scotia, many of which continue to exist today. Over the course of the 17th century, the French Crown lost via war and treaties its Maritimes territories to the British sovereign.

Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, was sent in 1794 to take command of Nova Scotia, where he, an amateur architect, designed many of Halifax's forts, oversaw the construction of numerous roads, devised a telegraph system, and left an indelible mark on the city in the form of public buildings of Georgian architecture. After he departed in 1800, he remained remembered for his deeds, such as the construction of both St. George's Round Church and the Halifax Town Clock, as well as improvements to the Grand Parade.

For the bicentennial in 1983 of the arrival of the first Empire Loyalists in Nova Scotia,  Prince Charles, Prince of Wales, and his wife, Diana, Princess of Wales, attended the celebrations.

 Royal Visits to Nova Scotia

Nova Scotia, Monarchy in"," Monarchy in Nova Scotia The Monarchy in Nova Scotia refers to the current and former sovereign states and their respective constitutional monarchies within the Canadian province of Nova Scotia. The present monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, is the head of state of Nova Scotia, and the province's longest-reigning monarch. The first European colony in what is now Nova Scotia was established in 1604 by French explorer Samuel de Champlain, on Cape Breton Island at a place called Port-aux-Basques. In 1605, de Champlain established the first permanent European settlement in North America at Port Royal in what is now the Annapolis Valley. The French colony was known as Acadia and, after 1627, as New France. The British established their first permanent settlement in 1749 on the Halifax Peninsula. The colony was renamed Nova Scotia in 1759. The city of Halifax was founded in 1749 and became the provincial capital in 1775. From 1713 to 1867, the British colony of Nova Scotia was a separate colony from New Brunswick. In 1867, the two colonies were combined into the single colony of Nova Scotia, which later became the province of Nova Scotia. From that time, the British monarch has been the head of state of Nova Scotia. The Scottish Jacobite leader Charles de Saint-Étienne de la Tour established the first permanent European settlement at Port Royal (Annapolis Royal) in 1632. La Tour was followed by his son Charles de Saint-Étienne de Saint-Étienne de la Tour, who was in turn followed by his son Pierre de Saint-Étienne de Saint-Étienne de la Tour. When Pierre de Saint-Étienne de Saint-Étienne de la Tour died in 1704, the house of Saint-Étienne came to an end and the French authorities assumed control of the colony. From 1713 to 1755, the British and the French were in conflict in Europe and North America. In 1713, the British colony of Nova Scotia was established. The British monarch was the head of state of Nova Scotia from this time until Canadian Confederation in 1867. The capital of the colony was established at Annapolis Royal in 1729 and moved to Halifax in 1749. From 1755 to 1783, the British were in conflict with the Mi'kmaq and the French. In 1755, the British captured Fort Beauséjour (near present-day Moncton) and established the colony of New Brunswick. The French were defeated at the Plains of Abraham in Quebec in 1759 and subsequently abandoned Acadia. In 1763, the British colony of Nova Scotia was expanded to include what is now Prince Edward Island and Quebec's Gaspé Peninsula. In 1867, the British colony of Nova Scotia became the province of Nova Scotia. The Canadian colonies of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Quebec united to form the single colony of British North America in 1840. The British monarch was the head of state of British North America from this time until Canadian Confederation in 1867. The capital of the colony was established at Halifax in 1749 and moved to Ottawa in 1867. In the early 20th century, the British and the Mi'kmaq signed a treaty ceding most of the Mi'kmaq's land to the British. The treaty was never ratified by the British and the land was not surrendered. In 1999, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the treaty was still in effect and that the British Crown was still in possession of the land. In 2009, the province of Nova Scotia adopted the Scottish tartan as its official tartan. The tartan was designed in 1953 by the Scottish weaver William Donald Alexander.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,8518955,0.057383966244725734,0.29473684210526313,0.23381872738504986,0.6651090342679128,1,1,0,0,6,1,1,0,0,1,0.19769615311762317,0.017011609085217955,0.005247169290251312,0.011056511056511056,7,1,14,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,6,1,15,1,1,1
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Norfloxacin"", the article should at least have 250 words","Norfloxacin, sold under the brand name Noroxin among others, is an antibiotic that belongs to the class of fluoroquinolone antibiotics. It is used to treat urinary tract infections, gynecological infections, inflammation of the prostate gland, gonorrhea and bladder infection. Eye drops were approved for use in children older than one year of age.

Norfloxacin is associated with a number of rare serious adverse reactions as well as spontaneous tendon ruptures and irreversible peripheral neuropathy. Tendon problems may manifest long after therapy had been completed and in severe cases may result in lifelong disabilities.

It was patented in 1977 and approved for medical use in 1983.

Medical uses
The initial approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1986 encompassed the following indications:

Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (including cystitis)
Complicated urinary tract infections (restricted use) 
Uncomplicated urethral and cervical gonorrhea (however this indication is no longer considered to be effective by some experts due to bacterial resistance) 
Prostatitis due to Escherichia coli.
Syphilis treatment: Norfloxacin has not been shown to be effective in the treatment of syphilis.  Antimicrobial agents used in high doses for short periods of time to treat gonorrhea may mask or delay the symptoms of incubating syphilis.

Although fluoroquinolones are sometimes used to treat typhoid and paratyphoid fever, norfloxacin had more clinical failures than the other fluoroquinolones (417 participants, 5 trials).

In ophthalmology, Norfloxacin licensed use is limited to the treatment of conjunctival infections caused by susceptible bacteria.

Norfloxacin has been restricted in the Republic of Ireland due to the risks of C. difficile super infections and permanent nerve as well as tendon injuries. It licensed use in acute and chronic complicated kidney infections has been withdrawn as a result.

The European Medicines Agency, also in 2008, had recommended restricting the use of oral norfloxacin to treat urinary infections. CHMP had concluded that the marketing authorizations for norfloxacin, when used in the treatment of acute or chronic complicated pyelonephritis, should be withdrawn because the benefits do not outweigh their risks in this indication. CHMP stated that doctors should not prescribe oral norfloxacin for complicated pyelonephritis and should consider switching patients already taking oral norfloxacin for this type of infection to an alternative antibiotic.

Norfloxacin is used for prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhotic patients who have a low ascites fluid protein level, impaired renal function, severe liver disease, have had a prior episode of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, or esophageal variceal bleeding.

Note: Norfloxacin may be licensed for other uses, or restricted, by the various regulatory agencies worldwide.

Contraindications
As noted above, under licensed use, norfloxacin is also now considered to be contraindicated for the treatment of certain sexually transmitted diseases by some experts due to bacterial resistance.

Norfloxacin is contraindicated in those with a history of tendonitis, tendon rupture and those with a hypersensitivity to fluoroquinolones.

There are three contraindications found within the 2008 package insert:

""Noroxin (norfloxacin) is contraindicated in persons with a history of hypersensitivity, tendinitis, or tendon rupture associated with the use of norfloxacin or any member of the quinolone group of antimicrobial agents.""
""Quinolones, including norfloxacin, have been shown in vitro to inhibit CYP1A2. Concomitant use with drugs metabolized by CYP1A2 (e.g., caffeine, clozapine, ropinirole, tacrine, theophylline, tizanidine) may result in increased substrate drug concentrations when given in usual doses. Patients taking any of these drugs concomitantly with norfloxacin should be carefully monitored.""
""Concomitant administration with tizanidine is contraindicated""

Norfloxacin is also considered to be contraindicated within the pediatric population.

Pregnancy
Norfloxacin has been reported to rapidly cross the blood-placenta and blood-milk barrier, and is extensively distributed into the fetal tissues. For this reason norfloxacin and other fluoroquinolones are contraindicated during pregnancy due to the risk of spontaneous abortions and birth defects. The fluoroquinolones have also been reported as being present in the mother's milk and are passed on to the nursing child, which may increases the risk of the child suffering an adverse reaction even though the child had never been prescribed or taken any of the drugs found within this class. As safer alternatives are generally available norfloxacin is contraindicated during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester. The manufacturer only recommends use of norfloxacin during pregnancy when benefit outweighs risk.

Children
A 1998 retrospective survey found that numerous side effects have been recorded in reference to the unapproved use of norfloxacin in the pediatric population.
Fluoroquinolones are not licensed by the FDA for use in children due to the risk of fatalities as well as permanent injury to the musculoskeletal system, with two exceptions. Ciprofloxacin is being licensed for the treatment of Complicated Urinary Tract Infections and Pyelonephritis due to Escherichia coli and Inhalational Anthrax (post-exposure) and levofloxacin was recently licensed for the treatment of Inhalational Anthrax (post-exposure). However, the Fluoroquinolones are licensed to treat lower respiratory infections in children with cystic fibrosis in the UK.

Adverse effects
In general, fluoroquinolones are well tolerated, with most side-effects being mild to moderate.  On occasion, serious adverse effects occur. Common side-effects include gastrointestinal effects such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, as well as headache and insomnia.

The overall rate of adverse events in patients treated with fluoroquinolones is roughly similar to that seen in patients treated with other antibiotic classes. A U.S. Centers for Disease Control study found patients treated with fluoroquinolones experienced adverse events severe enough to lead to an emergency department visit more frequently than those treated with cephalosporins or macrolides, but less frequently than those treated with penicillins, clindamycin, sulfonamides, or vancomycin.

Post-marketing surveillance has revealed a variety of relatively rare but serious adverse effects that are associated with all members of the fluoroquinolone antibacterial class. Among these, tendon problems and exacerbation of the symptoms of the neurological disorder myasthenia gravis are the subject of ""black box"" warnings in the United States. The most severe form of tendonopathy associated with fluoroquinolone administration is tendon rupture, which in the great majority of cases involves the Achilles tendon. Younger people typically experience good recovery, but permanent disability is possible, and is more likely in older patients.  The overall frequency of fluoroquinolone-associated Achilles tendon rupture in patients treated with ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin has been estimated at 17 per 100,000 treatments. Risk is substantially elevated in the elderly and in those with recent exposure to topical or systemic corticosteroid therapy. Simultaneous use of corticosteroids is present in almost one-third of quinolone-associated tendon rupture. Tendon damage may manifest during, as well as up to a year after fluoroquinolone therapy has been completed.

FQs prolong the QT interval by blocking voltage-gated potassium channels. Prolongation of the QT interval can lead to torsades de pointes, a life-threatening arrhythmia, but in practice this appears relatively uncommon in part because the most widely prescribed fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin) only minimally prolong the QT interval.

Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea may occur in connection with the use of any antibacterial drug, especially those with a broad spectrum of activity such as clindamycin, cephalosporins, and fluoroquinolones. Fluoroquinoline treatment is associated with risk that is similar to or less  than that associated with broad spectrum cephalosporins. Fluoroquinoline administration may be associated with the acquisition and outgrowth of a particularly virulent Clostridium strain.

The U.S. prescribing information contains a warning regarding uncommon cases of peripheral neuropathy, which can be permanent. Other nervous system effects include insomnia, restlessness, and rarely, seizure, convulsions, and psychosis Other rare and serious adverse events have been observed with varying degrees of evidence for causation.

Events that may occur in acute overdose are rare, and include kidney failure and seizure. Susceptible groups of patients, such as children and the elderly, are at greater risk of adverse reactions during therapeutic use.

Interactions
The toxicity of drugs that are metabolised by the cytochrome P450 system is enhanced by concomitant use of some quinolones. Quinolones, including norfloxacin, may enhance the effects of oral anticoagulants, including warfarin or its derivatives or similar agents. When these products are administered concomitantly, prothrombin time or other suitable coagulation tests should be closely monitored. Coadministration may dangerously increase coumadin warfarin activity; INR should be monitored closely.

They may also interact with the GABA A receptor and cause neurological symptoms; this effect is augmented by certain non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. 
The concomitant administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with a quinolone, including norfloxacin, may increase the risk of CNS stimulation and convulsive seizures. Therefore, norfloxacin should be used with caution in individuals receiving NSAIDS concomitantly.

Elevated serum levels of cyclosporine have been reported with concomitant use of cyclosporine with norfloxacin. Therefore, cyclosporine serum levels should be monitored and appropriate cyclosporine dosage adjustments made when these drugs are used concomitantly.

The concomitant administration of quinolones including norfloxacin with glyburide (a sulfonylurea agent) has, on rare occasions, resulted in severe hypoglycemia. Therefore, monitoring of blood glucose is recommended when these agents are co-administered.

Medications

Some quinolones exert an inhibitory effect on the cytochrome P-450 system, thereby reducing theophylline clearance and increasing theophylline blood levels. Coadministration of certain fluoroquinolones and other drugs primarily metabolized by CYP1A2 (e.g. theophylline, methylxanthines, tizanidine) results in increased plasma concentrations and could lead to clinically significant side effects of the coadministered drug. Additionally other fluoroquinolones, especially enoxacin, and to a lesser extent ciprofloxacin and pefloxacin, also inhibit the metabolic clearance of theophylline.

Such drug interactions are associated with the molecular structural modifications of the quinolone ring, specifically interactions involving NSAIDS and theophylline.  As such, these drug interactions involving the fluoroquinolones appear to be drug specific rather than a class effect.  The fluoroquinolones have also been shown to interfere with the metabolism of caffeine and the absorption of levothyroxine. The interference with the metabolism of caffeine may lead to the reduced clearance of caffeine and a prolongation of its serum half-life, resulting in a caffeine overdose.  This may lead to reduced clearance of caffeine and a prolongation of the plasma's half-life that may lead to accumulation of caffeine in plasma when products containing caffeine are consumed while taking norfloxacin.

The use of NSAIDs (Non Steroid Anti Inflammatory Drugs) while undergoing fluoroquinolone therapy is contra-indicated due to the risk of severe CNS adverse reactions, including but not limited to seizure disorders. Fluoroquinolones with an unsubstituted piperazinyl moiety at position 7 have the potential to interact with NSAIDs and/or their metabolites, resulting in antagonism of GABA neurotransmission.

The use of norfloxacin concomitantly has also been associated with transient elevations in serum creatinine in patients receiving cyclosporine, on rare occasions, resulted in severe hypoglycemia with sulfonylurea. Renal tubular transport of methotrexate may be inhibited by concomitant administration of norfloxacin, potentially leading to increased plasma levels of methotrexate. This might increase the risk of methotrexate toxic reactions.

Current or past treatment with oral corticosteroids is associated with an increased risk of Achilles tendon rupture, especially in elderly patients who are also taking the fluoroquinolones.

Overdose

Treatment of overdose includes emptying of the stomach via induced vomiting or by gastric lavage. Careful monitoring and supportive treatment, monitoring of renal and liver function, and maintaining adequate hydration is recommended by the manufacturer. Administration of magnesium, aluminum, or calcium containing antacids can reduce the absorption of norfloxacin.

Mechanism of action
Norfloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.  It functions by inhibiting DNA gyrase, a type II topoisomerase, and topoisomerase IV, enzymes necessary to separate bacterial DNA, thereby inhibiting cell division. Norfloxacin does not bind to DNA gyrase but does bind to the substrate DNA.  A review in 2001 suggests that cytotoxicity of fluoroquinolones is likely a 2-step process involving (1) conversion of the topoisomerase-quinolone-DNA complex to an irreversible form and (2) generation of a double-strand break by denaturation of the topoisomerase.

Pharmacokinetics

“Absorption of norfloxacin is rapid following single doses of 200 mg, 400 mg and 800 mg. At the respective doses, mean peak serum and plasma concentrations of 0.8, 1.5 and 2.4 μg/mL are attained approximately one hour after dosing. The effective half-life of norfloxacin in serum and plasma is 3–4 hours. Steady-state concentrations of norfloxacin will be attained within two days of dosing.  Renal excretion occurs by both glomerular filtration and tubular secretion as evidenced by the high rate of renal clearance (approximately 275 mL/min). Within 24 hours of drug administration, 26 to 32% of the administered dose is recovered in the urine as norfloxacin with an additional 5-8% being recovered in the urine as six active metabolites of lesser antimicrobial potency. Only a small percentage (less than 1%) of the dose is recovered thereafter. Fecal recovery accounts for another 30% of the administered dose.  Two to three hours after a single 400-mg dose, urinary concentrations of 200 μg/mL or more are attained in the urine. In healthy volunteers, mean urinary concentrations of norfloxacin remain above 30 μg/mL for at least 12 hours following a 400-mg dose. The urinary pH may affect the solubility of norfloxacin. Norfloxacin is least soluble at urinary pH of 7.5 with greater solubility occurring at pHs above and below this value. The serum protein binding of norfloxacin is between 10 and 15%.” Quoting from the 2009 package insert for Noroxin.

Biotransformation is via the liver and kidneys, with a half-life of 3–4 hours.

History
The first members of the quinolone antibacterial class were relatively low potency drugs such as nalidixic acid, used mainly in the treatment of urinary tract infections owing to their renal excretion and propensity to be concentrated in urine.  In 1979 the publication of a patent filed by the pharmaceutical arm of Kyorin Seiyaku Kabushiki Kaisha disclosed the discovery of norfloxacin, and the demonstration that certain structural modifications including the attachment of a fluorine atom to the quinolone ring leads to dramatically enhanced antibacterial potency.

In spite of the substantial increase in antibacterial activity of norfloxacin relative to early fluoroquinolones, it did not become a widely used antibiotic. Other companies initiated fluoroquinolone discovery programs in the aftermath of the publication of the norfloxacin patent. Bayer Pharmaceuticals discovered that the addition of a single carbon atom to the norfloxacin structure provided another 4 to 10-fold improvement in activity.  Ciprofloxacin reached the market just one year after norfloxacin and achieved sales of 1.5 billion Euros at its peak.

Kyorin granted Merck & Company, Inc., an exclusive license (in certain countries, including the United States), to import and distribute Norfloxacin under the brand name Noroxin. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Noroxin for distribution in the United States on October 31, 1986.

Availability
In most countries, all formulations require a prescription. In Colombia (South America) it is marketed under Ambigram from Laboratorios Bussié

Noroxin was discontinued in the US as of April 2014

AstraZeneca brands"," Norfloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections. It is available by mouth, by injection, and as an ear drops. It is a narrow-spectrum antibiotic, meaning it only treats a limited number of bacterial infections. Norfloxacin was developed in the 1980s and was first marketed in 1991. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Norfloxacin is a synthetic antibiotic of the fluoroquinolone class. It is used to treat bacterial infections. It functions by inhibiting the bacterial DNA gyrase enzyme, which is required for the replication of bacterial DNA. This leads to the accumulation of double-stranded DNA breaks, which eventually causes the death of the bacteria. Norfloxacin is typically given orally as a tablet or liquid suspension, with a recommended dose of 400 mg/day for adults and 200 mg/day for children. For the treatment of severe infections, it may be given by injection, with a recommended dose of 400 mg/day for adults and 200 mg/day for children. The duration of treatment will depend on the type of infection being treated. Norfloxacin is generally well-tolerated, with most side effects being mild and transient. The most common side effects include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. More serious side effects may include tendon damage, hearing loss, and QT prolongation. Norfloxacin should be avoided during pregnancy due to the risk of causing birth defects. It should also be avoided in people with a history of tendon damage, as it may increase the risk of further damage. Additionally, it should be avoided in people with liver or kidney disease, as it may be contraindicated. Norfloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic, meaning it treats a wide range of bacterial infections. It is effective against many Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Proteus mirabilis.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Gaétan Nadeau"", the article should at least have 250 words","Gaétan Nadeau (born December 12, 1953) is a politician and author in the Canadian province of Quebec. He led the New Democratic Party of Quebec from April to September 1989 and helped bring about its autonomy from the New Democratic Party of Canada.

Early life and political career before 1989

Nadeau was born in Joliette in 1953. He was a Parti Québécois (PQ) activist before joining the New Democratic Party and served as an executive assistant to legislator Guy Chevrette. He was also a supporter of the municipal Montreal Citizens' Movement (MCM) and served on its economy committee. In 1988, he criticized the party's pro-business direction in government.

He ran for the House of Commons of Canada as the New Democratic Party candidate for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve in the 1988 federal election. He criticized the proposed Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement on the grounds that it would hurt manufacturing jobs in his riding. Nadeau was considered one of the party's strongest candidates in Quebec, and some party insiders believed he had a chance for an upset victory. In the event, he finished third against Progressive Conservative candidate Allan Koury.

Shortly before election day, Nadeau and six other NDP candidates with Quebec nationalist views held a press conference to denounce Canada's policies on bilingualism.

New Democratic Party leader

Nadeau was elected to lead the Quebec New Democratic Party in April 1989, defeating incumbent leader Roland Morin. The election contest was centred on the Quebec NDP's relationship with the federal party. At the time, the NDP had a single party organization in Quebec that was responsible for both federal and provincial matters. Several members of the Quebec NDP opposed its links to the federal party, particularly in light of ideological divisions on issues relating to Quebec nationalism. The Quebec party supported the province's Charter of the French Language, opposed the Meech Lake Accord, and were sceptical toward the Canadian constitution because it was approved without Quebec's support. Nadeau favoured the creation of a separate provincial party, while Morin initially opposed it before declaring his neutrality.

Nadeau, who was thirty-five years old at the time, also highlighted the generational divide between himself and the fifty-seven-year-old Morin. He said, ""The leadership choice is clearly between a democratic socialist who has a vision for the '90s and one who is clinging to the outdated notions of the '70s."" For his part, Morin described Nadeau as a single-issue candidate focused only on the environment. Nadeau defeated Morin at a party convention held on April 30, 1989, as the party also voted to separate from the federal organization and become a completely distinct entity.

The NDP ran fifty-five candidates in the 1989 election. Its campaign began in confusion, when the party executive approved an election platform that Nadeau derided as ""naive Marxism."" He initially threatened to resign as party leader, but refrained when the executive agreed to withdraw the offending document. Nadeau later described the platform as having resulted from the ""fertile imagination"" of a single party worker who misunderstood the instructions of its policy committee.

Nadeau secured a more prominent place for environmental issues in the party's revised platform, but he could not prevent party activists from adding a focus on Quebec nationalism. Nadeau opposed this on strategic grounds, arguing that it would not help the party build support. Others argued that it prevented the party from winning support among anglophone Liberals who were disgruntled with the nationalist policies of premier Robert Bourassa.

Close to election day, Nadeau acknowledged that his party would not win any seats in the legislature. The NDP received about one per cent of the popular vote, and Nadeau received only 437 votes for a distant fourth-place finish in the Montreal division of Dorion. He resigned as party leader on September 26, 1989, one day after the election, saying that the Quebec NDP would never be able to succeed because of a ""hard core of Marxists"" hindering its development.

Since 1989

Nadeau was a researcher for the municipal Democratic Coalition party in the early 1990s.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Patently offensive"", the article should at least have 250 words","Patently offensive is a term used in United States law regarding obscenity under the First Amendment.

The phrase ""patently offensive"" first appeared in Roth v. United States, referring to any obscene acts or materials that are considered to be openly, plainly, or clearly visible as offensive to the viewing public. The Roth standard outlined what is to be considered obscene and thus not under First Amendment protection. The Roth standard was largely replaced by the Miller test established by Miller v. California (1973).

Roth standard

According to the ""Roth Standard"" a work is obscene if:
The dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to a prurient interest in sex,
The material is patently offensive because it affronts contemporary community standards relating to the description or representation of sexual matters,
The material is utterly without redeeming social value

Miller test

The Miller test was developed in the 1973 case Miller v. California. It has three parts:

Whether the average person, applying contemporary community standards, would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest,
Whether the work depicts/describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct or excretory functions specifically defined by applicable state law,
Whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.

Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, writing for the majority, included the following definitions of what may be ""patently offensive"":

""Representations or descriptions of ultimate sex acts normal or perverted, actual or simulated.""   
""Representations or descriptions of masturbation, excretory functions, and lewd exhibitions of the genitals.""

Supreme Court of the United States
Obscenity law"," Patently offensive The term ""patently offensive"" was coined by United States Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart in his concurring opinion in the 1967 case of Jacobellis v. Ohio, 378 U.S. 79. The case involved a challenge to the obscenity provisions of a statute criminalizing the sale of ""pornographic materials"" to minors. At issue was a copy of the French film Les Amants de la Bastille, which had been imported into the United States and was in the possession of an adult but was shown to minors. The Supreme Court had previously upheld the obscenity provisions of the law in a 1959 case, Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476. In Jacobellis, however, four Justices—Stewart, Hugo Black, William O. Douglas, and Abe Fortas—sided with the lower court's ruling that the film was not obscene and should not have been banned. In his concurring opinion, Stewart wrote: I shall not today attempt to define the kinds of material I understand to be embraced within that shorthand description; and perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly doing so. But I know it when I see it, and the motion picture involved in this case is not that. In a broader sense, the film is patently offensive to me, as it is to most people, not because of the questionable moral values it expresses (for I do not pretend to have settled opinions on such matters) but because of the humiliation and disgrace it imposes upon what we have been taught to regard as the ""first principles"" of Americanism—freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of religion. The term has since been used to indicate speech or expression that is shocking, disgusting, or offensive to the majority of people.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,17496561,0.018411967779056383,0.06315789473684211,0.09538594844393096,0.20093457943925233,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0.05863241737871861,0.05416648323567923,0.006213753106876553,0.06756756756756757,5,0,3,5,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,10,1,1,1

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""James Park Woods"", the article should at least have 250 words","James Park Woods  (4 January 1886 – 18 January 1963) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross during World War I; the Victoria Cross was the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that could be awarded to members of the Australian armed forces at the time. Woods enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force in September 1916 and, after training in Australia and the United Kingdom, joined his unit, the 48th Battalion, in France in September 1917. Along with the rest of his battalion, he participated in the First Battle of Passchendaele the following month. In early 1918, Woods was hospitalised for several months before rejoining his unit in May. He again reported sick in July, and did not return to the 48th Battalion until mid-August.

On 18 September 1918, the 48th Battalion was involved in the attack on the Hindenburg Outpost Line during the Hundred Days Offensive. After the first phase of the attack, some elements of Woods' unit were tasked to support another battalion as it conducted a further assault. When it was suspected that flanking British troops had not gone forward to their objective as reported, a four-man patrol including Woods attempted to make contact with them. Instead of finding British troops, they encountered a strong German post and, after calling for reinforcements, attacked it, driving more than thirty Germans from the position. Woods' actions during this assault and subsequent defence of the captured post resulted in him being awarded the Victoria Cross. Woods survived the war, returned to Australia and operated a vineyard and orchard in Western Australia. He retired early due to ill health and died in 1963. His medals are displayed in the Hall of Valour at the Australian War Memorial.

Early life
James Park ""Jimmy"" Woods was born at Two Wells, South Australia, on 4 January 1886, the son of a blacksmith, James Woods, and his wife Ester  Johnson. After his mother's death when he was seven, Woods was raised by a stepsister and, after completing his schooling, worked in a vineyard alongside his brothers. Not long after World War I broke out in 1914, he attempted to enlist in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF), but was rejected due to his height of . He and his brother Will then moved to Western Australia and for the next two years worked in cartage and fencing in the Kantanning district before James became a viticulturist at Caversham in the Swan Valley wine region near Perth. He was also an enthusiastic cricketer in his younger years. After further unsuccessful attempts to join the AIF, he was eventually successful on 29 September 1916, after height requirements had been lowered.

World War I

1916–1917
Following his enlistment as a private, Woods was allotted as a reinforcement to the 48th Battalion, a mixed South Australian-Western Australian unit, part of the 12th Brigade, 4th Division. It was already serving on the Western Front in France and Belgium. After two months training at Blackboy Hill, Woods embarked with the rest of his reinforcement draft on  at Fremantle on 23 December 1916. He disembarked at Devonport in the UK on 16 February 1917, and joined the 12th Training Battalion at Codford on Salisbury Plain. During this training period, he was hospitalised with mumps and then with bronchitis and pneumonia. Recovered, he completed his training, embarked at Southampton for France, and joined the 48th Battalion on 12 September.

At the time Woods joined the battalion, it was undergoing training and absorbing reinforcements in a rest area at Zuytpeene. On 21 September, the battalion was collected by buses and transported over several days via Steenvoorde to the vicinity of Ypres in Belgium. There the 12th Brigade relieved other units of the 4th Division that had participated in the Battle of Polygon Wood and took up support positions. During this period its main tasks were battlefield salvage and digging graves for recently killed Germans and Australians. Despite these non-combat tasks, the battalion suffered several casualties from German artillery fire. The 48th Battalion was relieved from these positions on 1 October, and occupied trenches at Westhoek Ridge overnight before returning to Steenvoorde.

After a week at Steenvoorde, Woods' battalion marched to Abeele on 10 October, then entrained for Ypres. That evening it marched to trenches on Westhoek Ridge, where it received orders for a major attack by the division: the First Battle of Passchendaele, which was fought on 12 October. Despite initial success and the capture of more than 200 Germans, the main attack failed, leaving the left flank of the battalion exposed. The first German counterattack was beaten off, but with its left flank unprotected, the 48th Battalion was pushed back to its start line by a second counterattack. During the fighting, the unit suffered 370 casualties from its original complement of 621. Woods and the rest of the battalion were withdrawn from the line and they were re-united with the nucleus troops, the one-third of each unit that was retained out of the line when a battalion went into action. Thus reinforced, the battalion then went briefly into a support position on Anzac Ridge on 19 October, before being relieved and marching away from Passchendaele for a long period of rest and recuperation. This time was spent first at Cuhem, then Friancourt before the battalion spent a few weeks at a camp near Péronne, where Woods and the rest of the unit celebrated Christmas Day.

1918
On 8 January 1918, the 48th Battalion marched to Péronne and, travelling by train and on foot, arrived in Belgium where they entered the front line trenches near Hollebeke on 11 January. The battalion remained in the quiet trenches in cold winter conditions for ten days before being relieved, being mainly engaged on improving the dilapidated defences. On the day after the battalion was relieved and went into the rear area, Woods reported sick. He was diagnosed with either bronchitis or pericarditis, and was evacuated to a hospital in Birmingham, UK. He did not return to his battalion until 30 May, when the battalion was in a rest area at Rivery. On 2 June the unit moved forward again, taking up positions as part of the divisional reserve. Two weeks later, the 48th Battalion moved into the front line near Sailly-le-Sec, from which it was relieved on 4 July. It then went back into a rest area near Allonville with the remainder of the 4th Division. This rest period continued to the end of the month, but on 23 July, Woods reported sick with dysentery. He was evacuated and admitted to a casualty clearing station to recover, and did not return to his unit until 16 August. At this time, the battalion was in the front line near Lihons, where it had a quiet time until relieved on 24 August. The unit was then withdrawn to a rest area near Saint-Vaast-en-Chaussée where it remained for nearly two weeks.

By September 1918, the Allies were in the midst of the Hundred Days Offensive, a series of unanswered attacks that had commenced with the Battle of Amiens on 8 August. As part of the attack on the Hindenburg Outpost Line on 18 September, the 48th Battalion led the assault in the first phase, capturing 480 Germans, and they were followed by the 45th and 46th Battalions which were responsible for the second and third phases respectively. The Australian attack was near Le Verguier, north-west of St. Quentin. On the right flank of the 12th Brigade, the British 1st Division delayed its assault on the third objective line. The commander of the 12th Brigade, Brigadier General Raymond Leane, therefore ordered two companies of the 48th Battalion to protect the flank of the 46th Battalion as it conducted the third phase of the attack. After the 46th Battalion's successful assault, the two companies of the 48th Battalion were tasked to assist the 46th Battalion in consolidating their position. The British 1st Division on the right flank repeatedly reported that they had also captured the third objective, and Leane sent patrols to confirm.

Woods was a member of a four-man patrol sent on Leane's orders to make contact with the British. Instead of finding British troops, they located a strongly defended German position with excellent fields of fire. While an attack in force on the position was being organised, Woods led the patrol against the German defenders. Woods killed one German, and at least thirty others fled, leaving behind four heavy and two light machine guns. One of the patrol was wounded in the assault, but they managed to hold off several determined counterattacks until reinforcements arrived. Woods climbed onto the parapet, lay down, and threw hand grenades passed to him, causing severe casualties to the Germans. Reinforcements arrived when he was down to his last few rifle cartridges, and the post was secured by dawn. During the overall brigade attack, the 48th Battalion suffered just 65 casualties. For his work, Woods was recommended for the Victoria Cross (VC).

The 4th Division was then relieved and went to the rear to rest, and the brigade did not return to combat before the Armistice of 11 November 1918. Woods' VC citation was published on Christmas Eve 1918, and read:

Woods' VC was the only one awarded to a member of the 48th Battalion. He received the decoration from King George V at Buckingham Palace on 31 May 1919. Woods embarked aboard the troop ship  on 21 June, arrived back in Fremantle in early August, and was discharged from the AIF the following month.

Later life

On his return to civilian life, Woods bought and operated a vineyard and orchard in the Swan Valley. He married Olive Adeline Wilson at the Caversham Methodist Church on 30 April 1921. The couple had seven children: four sons and three daughters. James suffered from poor health as a result of his gassing and chest infections during his service, and in 1937 retired on a full pension, expected to only live a few more years. The family moved to Claremont. His sons Gordon and Norman served in the Royal Australian Air Force during World War II; Gordon, the eldest, was killed in a flying training accident near Newcastle, New South Wales, in October 1943. In retirement, Woods was involved with the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, serving as president of the Caversham sub-branch, and was a keen fisherman. In 1956, he went to the UK to attend the VC centenary.

Woods died on 18 January 1963 in the Repatriation General Hospital, Hollywood, in Nedlands, aged 77, and was buried in Karrakatta Cemetery. He was survived by his wife and six children. A ward at the Repatriation General Hospital, now known as the Hollywood Private Hospital, is named in his honour.

As well as the Victoria Cross, British War Medal and Victory Medal for his service in World War I, Woods was later awarded the King George VI Coronation Medal and Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal. His medal set, including his Victoria Cross, was presented to the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, and is displayed in the Hall of Valour. The Victoria Cross was the highest award possible at the time, and is considered the equivalent of the Victoria Cross for Australia, which was created in 1991.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Morris Swadesh"", the article should at least have 250 words","Morris Swadesh (; January 22, 1909 – July 20, 1967) was an American linguist who specialized in comparative and historical linguistics.

Swadesh was born in Massachusetts to Bessarabian Jewish immigrant parents. He completed bachelor's and master's degrees at the University of Chicago, studying under Edward Sapir, and then followed Sapir to Yale University where he completed a Ph.D. in 1933. Swadesh taught at the University of Wisconsin–Madison from 1937 to 1939, and then during World War II worked on projects with the United States Army and Office of Strategic Services. He became a professor at the City College of New York after the war's end, but was fired in 1949 due to his membership in the Communist Party. He spent most of the rest of his life teaching in Mexico and Canada.

Swadesh had a particular interest in the indigenous languages of the Americas, and conducted extensive fieldwork throughout North America. He was one of the pioneers of glottochronology and lexicostatistics, and is known for his creation of the Swadesh list, a compilation of basic concepts believed to present across cultures and thus suitable for cross-linguistic comparison. Swadesh believed that his techniques could discover deep relationships between apparently unrelated languages, thus allowing for the identification of macrofamilies and possibly even a ""Proto-Human"" language. His theories were often controversial, and some have been deprecated by later linguists.

Early life and education
Swadesh was born in 1909 in Holyoke, Massachusetts, to Jewish immigrant parents from Bessarabia. His parents were multilingual, and he grew up with Yiddish, some Russian, and English as his first languages.

Swadesh earned his B.A. and M.A. from the University of Chicago, where he began studying with the linguist Edward Sapir. He followed Sapir to Yale University, where he earned his Ph.D. in 1933. Inspired by Sapir's early lists of word similarities among Native American languages, he began a life work in comparative linguistics.

Early career
In the 1930s, Swadesh conducted extensive fieldwork on more than 20 indigenous languages of the Americas, with travels in Canada, Mexico, and the US.  He worked most prominently on the Chitimacha language, a now-extinct language isolate found among indigenous people of Louisiana.  His fieldnotes and subsequent publications constitute the main source of information on this extinct language. He also conducted smaller amounts of fieldwork on the Menominee and Mahican languages, in Wisconsin and New York, respectively; both are part of the Algonquian language family.

Swadesh taught linguistics and anthropology at the University of Wisconsin in Madison from 1937 to 1939. During this time he devised and organized the highly original ""Oneida Language and Folklore Project."" This program hired more than a dozen Oneida Indians in Wisconsin for a WPA project (under the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration) to record and translate texts in the Oneida language. (The Oneida were historically one of the five nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, with their historic territory located in central New York state, but some had moved to Wisconsin in the 19th century.) In this same period in other WPA projects, writers were recording state histories and guides, and researchers were collecting oral histories of African Americans who had been born into slavery before the end of the Civil War.

Swadesh was let go by the University of Wisconsin just as he was to begin the project. Floyd Lounsbury, then an undergraduate, was assigned to finish it. Lounsbury continued his studies in linguistics, later serving as Sterling Professor of Anthropology and Linguistics at Yale University.

In May 1939 Swadesh went to Mexico, where he had been hired to assist the government of Mexican President Lázaro Cárdenas, who was promoting the education of indigenous peoples. Swadesh learned the Purépecha language for this work. Together with rural school teachers, Swadesh worked in indigenous villages, teaching people to read first in their own languages, before teaching them Spanish. He worked with the Tarahumara, Purépecha, and Otomi peoples. Swadesh also learned Spanish in less than a year; he was fluent enough that he was able to give a series of linguistics lectures (in Spanish) at the Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolás de Hidalgo and publish his first book, ""La Nueva Filologia,"" in Spanish in 1941. 

Returning to the U.S., during the Second World War Swadesh worked on military projects for the U.S. Army and the OSS to compile reference materials on Burmese, Chinese, Russian, and Spanish. He also wrote easy-to-learn textbooks for troops to learn Russian and Chinese.

Swadesh served in Burma, where Lt. Roger Hilsman described his linguistic skills as extraordinary. Swadesh learned enough of the Naga language, after spending only one day with a local guide, that he was able to give a ten-minute thank-you speech in that language. Hilsman recalled that Swadesh had been strongly opposed to racial segregation in the United States.

Red Scare
In May 1949, Swadesh was fired by the City College of New York (CCNY) due to accusations that he was a Communist. That was during the Red Scare, and he was one of a number of anthropologists and other academics to be opposed by anticommunists during the McCarthy Era. Swadesh had been a member of the Denver Communist Party and was active in the protest movement against the execution of convicted spies,  Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. Swadesh continued to work in the United States until 1954, aided by limited funding from the American Philosophical Society of Philadelphia.

Later career
In 1956 Swadesh returned to Mexico, where he took a position as researcher at the National Autonomous University of Mexico and taught linguistics at the National School of Anthropology and History (Escuela Nacional de Antropología e Historia), in Mexico City.

In 1966, he was appointed Professor of General Linguistics at the University of Alberta in Canada. He was developing plans for a major research project in Western Canada at the time of his death, in the summer of 1967.

Work in historical linguistics
Swadesh is best known for his work in historical linguistics. Any language changes over centuries (consider, for example, the changes in English since the Middle Ages). Some languages diverge and become separate dialects, or languages that still belong to the same language family. Tracking similarities and differences between languages is part of historical linguistics.  Swadesh proposed a number of distant genetic links among languages.

He was the chief pioneer of lexicostatistics, which attempts to classify languages on the basis of the extent to which they have replaced basic words reconstructible in the proto-language, and glottochronology, which extends lexicostatistics by computing divergence dates from the lexical retention rate.

Swadesh became a consultant with the International Auxiliary Language Association, which standardized Interlingua and presented it to the public in 1951 (Esterhill 2000). In this role, he originated the lists of 100 and 200 basic vocabulary items, used (with some variation) in both lexicostatistics and glottochronology for comparison among languages. They have since been known as the Swadesh lists.

Some scholars considered Swadesh as a supporter of monogenesis, the theory that all languages have a common origin: ""Swadesh sought to show that all the world's languages are related in one large family"" (Ruhlen 1994:215). Others believe that Swadesh proposed early linkages, but believed that languages diverged immediately among peoples, as he expressed in his major, but unfinished work, The Origin and Diversification of Language (1971), published posthumously.

Personal life
Swadesh was married for a time to Mary Haas, a fellow American linguist. He later married Frances Leon, with whom he worked in Mexico in the 1930s; they divorced in the late 1950s.  He married linguist Evangelina Arana after his return to Mexico in 1956.

He died in Mexico City in July 1967.

20th-century linguists"," Morris Swadesh (May 15, 1909 – July 25, 1967) was an American linguist and anthropologist, and an important figure in the discipline of historical linguistics. Swadesh was born in Fort Dodge, Iowa to Simon and Anna (Krause) Swadesh. His parents were Jewish. He attended the University of Chicago, where he received a bachelor's degree in 1930, a master's degree in 1933, and a PhD in 1935, all in anthropology. He did additional graduate work at the University of Wisconsin in 1936 and at Columbia University in 1937. He was an assistant professor of anthropology at the University of Washington from 1937 to 1942. From 1942 to 1944 he was an associate in psychology at the University of Chicago. He joined the faculty of the University of Illinois in 1944 as an associate professor of anthropology and was appointed a full professor in 1958. He also served as the chair of the Department of Anthropology from 1948 to 1961. Swadesh was also associated with the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Chicago, and Columbia University at various times during his career. Swadesh was a fellow of the American Anthropological Association, the American Folklore Society, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a member of the Society for Linguistic Anthropology and the International Society for the History of Language. Swadesh did extensive work in the fields of historical linguistics, language evolution, and culture change. His most notable contribution was the development of the Swadesh list, a set of basic vocabulary items which are thought to be resistant to change over time, and thus can be used to compare languages and to calculate the genetic relationship between languages. He also did important work in the fields of semantics, syntax, and language contact. Swadesh was married to Nancy, and had two daughters, Ann and Mary. He died at the age of 58 from a heart attack, in New York City, in 1967. The Society for the Study of Language has annually awarded the Morris Swadesh Prize to an outstanding contribution to the field of language behavior since 1964.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,180560,0.3631601920558708,0.14736842105263157,0.3276181607369469,0.29283489096573206,11,9,0,1,4,1,0,0,0,1,0.24633255763869066,0.031136732880044603,0.024578845622756144,0.029484029484029485,148,1,13,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,18,1,27,1,1,1
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Fireworks Entertainment"", the article should at least have 250 words","Fireworks Entertainment (originally Skyvision Entertainment) was an independent studio originally founded in 1991 by Brian K. Ross and later bought out by Jay Firestone in 1996 to produce, distribute and finance television shows and feature films.

Skyvision Entertainment was originally operating as a division of John Labatt Entertainment Group.

In 1993, Orion Pictures inked an agreement with Skyvision Entertainment to handle series rights to the RoboCop franchise. Also that year, it entered into an agreement with Rigel Entertainment for international distribution rights to RoboCop: The Series.

In 1996, Skyvision Entertainment was purchased by Jay Firestone, former employee of Alliance Communications, and rebranded it to Fireworks Entertainment. The first show under the new name was F/X: The Series, which they acquired from Orion Pictures in 1994.

Fireworks was acquired by Canwest Global in May 1998, and was later sold to ContentFilm (production company of The Cooler), a British company, in April 2005. Over the years, Fireworks has amassed a significant catalogue of television shows and movies (under the Fireworks Pictures label)

In 1998, Peter Hoffman's Seven Arts Pictures formed an alliance with Fireworks to start out the Seven Arts International branding. In 2000, CanWest Films merged with Seven Arts International, another Canwest subsidiary to start the Fireworks Pictures branding to produce theatrical motion pictures. On October 2, 2001, Pliny Porter was hired as head of production and development for the Fireworks Pictures subsidiary, in order to make an effort to continue producing their own feature films.

From March 14, 2011, Fireworks International became Content Television under the umbrella Content Media Corporation PLC.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Fără cuvinte"", the article should at least have 250 words","""Fără Cuvinte"" (Speechless) is the fifth and final single by B.U.G. Mafia from their ninth studio album, Înapoi În Viitor (Back To The Future). The song features a guest appearance from Romanian pop singer Loredana Groza. Produced by group member Tataee and mixed by longtime B.U.G. Mafia collaborator Cristi Dobrică, it was released for digital download through the group's official website on June 29, 2011.

Musically, ""Fără Cuvinte"" is predominantly a rap song, backed by a dark, minimalist, drum-heavy production with extra piano keys featured in the introduction and the chorus. However, it also incorporates elements of other genres, particularly pop music with the Loredana Groza-sung chorus and arabic music, using various ethnic instruments in its instrumental production. Lyrically, the song is largely about the social situation in modern-day Romania and about how the group's members feel frustrated when dealing with day-to-day hardship and violence.

Due to the song's instrumental being leaked onto the Internet several months in advance to its release, it was a significant commercial success on its official release, particularly in the Romania, where it quickly rose to local music charts just days after being released.

Background 

The official version premiered through B.U.G. Mafia's official website. It was produced by member and founder Vlad ""Tataee"" Irimia, who is known for producing and overseeing every group release since their 1995 debut, Mafia. In an interview with Romanian TV station 1Music Channel, Tataee revealed that, after their 1998 collaboration with Loredana Groza, there had been talks about a new track ever since the mid-2000s, but this was the project that he felt she would be most appropriate to work with on. Groza herself told 1Music that she was excited to work with the group again and that she was anxious to hear reactions from their fans. The song features three verses, each from a group member talking about frustration that arises from dealing with selfishness and human nature altogether.

Music video 

The video was shot with Alex Ceaușu, the director behind ""Cât poți tu de tare"" (The Best You Can Be) and ""În Anii Ce-au Trecut"". The video also premiered on June 29, 2011.

The video begins with an introduction of actors Dragoş Bucur and Mirela Oprişor, who portray an average Romanian family, driving along on a country road while their infant child starts crying in the back of the car. As they start talking and try to comfort their child, they lose control of the car, go on the wrong lane and, as they try to avoid a collision with a truck, they roll over and crash the car. The video then cuts to the crash site with the two parents struggling to get out of the vehicle. As they desperately try to escape and call an emergency service, people start approaching the car, apparently to help them, but as they come closer to the car, they start robbing the two of all their possessions. The video alternates with shots of the group's members reciting their verses and the two characters struggling in agony as witnesses take part in a bizarre bystander effect, not only avoiding to help the two, but taking every valuable object they can find in the car in a scene reminiscent of the 2005 Andrew Niccol drama, Lord of War, meant to portray the absurde implications that poverty casts upon society. The finale reveals the ending of a skillfully crafted dream sequence, as Mirela Oprişor's character suddenly wakes up and comes to realize that she was having a nightmare in the car. The couple is listening to B.U.G. Mafia's previous collaboration with Loredana Groza, a 1998 single called ""Lumea e a mea"" (The World Is Mine) in the car.

According to Tataee, the video was shot in two locations, one a Bucharest IMGB warehouse and the other an abandoned monastery in Chiajna.

It lies at , 380 m above sea level. As of 2005, the mayor is the independent Venko Kavardzhikov, and the population of Gradets is 5,895, which makes it the second most populous village in Bulgaria, after Aydemir, Silistra Province, and the most populous in Bulgarian Thrace.

Gradets is situated in the Eastern Balkan Mountains, along the valley of the Luda Kamchiya. Gradets is characteristic because the vast majority of its residents are Bulgarian Roma (in 2000, 5,500 of 6,000 according to the then-mayor). In the early 20th century, Gradets had only around twenty Roma households, but their number later grew rapidly.

Notable natives include politician Petar Gudev (1862–1932), officer Radko Dimitriev (1859–1918) and Mustafa Shibil, a 19th-century Turkish Muslim Roma brigand who served as Yordan Yovkov's prototype for a hajduk character, as well as possibly the noted socialist Christian Rakovsky (1873–1941).

El Meson began franchising in 2018. El Meson Sandwiches units average $2 million in sales per year. System-wide sales in 2015 were just under $80 million.

History

The first El Meson Sandwiches opened in 1972 in the beach town of Aguadilla on Puerto Rico's northwestern tip. The restaurant was started by Felipe Perez Sr., father of the current CEO, Felipe Pérez Grajales. The original restaurant was known primarily for two things: home-style sandwiches and a familial atmosphere.

Many of El Meson's early customers were American surfers who came early in the day asking for big, healthy breakfasts. Their requests prompted Perez Sr. to create a sandwich dubbed The Surfer, which comes stuffed with fresh vegetables and soy-based protein. The second Puerto Rico location opened in 1987, shortly after the younger Perez returned from college in Jacksonville, Florida. Rapid growth followed.

Products

El Meson sandwiches are mostly served on criollo bread, a sweet, French-style bread with a Caribbean flavor. Most are pressed on a hot grill and served with cabbage, tomatoes, and mayo. The Delicioso sandwich comes with turkey and bacon. The White House is grilled with roast beef, turkey and mushrooms. El Meson also serves sandwiches on baked potatoes.

Current leadership

Felipe Pérez Grajales is the current CEO of El Meson Sandwiches. He was born in 1965, the eldest of three brothers. From the early 1970s through his high school years, Grajales worked in the original El Meson restaurant in Aguadilla. In 1983 he left Puerto Rico to attend Jacksonville University. Though he received several offers from companies in the U.S., he returned to Puerto Rico in 1986 to help expand the family business.

Grajales has been recognized as an outstanding businessman by Ernst & Young, the Puerto Rico Chamber of Commerce, the Sales & Marketing Executives (SME) Association, and the House of Representatives and Senate of Puerto Rico.

He was president of the Organizing Committee for the 2010 Central American and Caribbean Games in Mayagüez in 2010 and is president of the Mayagüez 2010 Foundation.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Monsoon Shootout"", the article should at least have 250 words","Monsoon Shootout is a 2013 Indian Hindi-language neo-noir action thriller film written and directed by Amit Kumar and produced by Guneet Monga, Trevor Ingma, Martijn de Grunt, and co-produced by Anurag Kashyap, and Vivek Rangachari, starring Vijay Varma, Geetanjali Thapa, Sreejita De, Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Tannishtha Chatterjee in the lead roles.  The film received positive reviews at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival in the Official Midnight Screenings section. Belonging to the school of Parallel cinema, Monsoon Shootout was released worldwide four years later on 15 December 2017 to positive reviews.

Plot
As the raging monsoon lashes Mumbai, the commercial and mafia capital of India, the police struggle to keep up with the gangsters who are ever more emboldened. Aditya “Adi”, a principled rookie cop as his first assignment on the force, joins an elite, anti-extortion unit of the Mumbai police led by Khan, a cop in the ‘Dirty Harry’ mold. On his first evening on the job, Adi had planned to meet his ex-lover Anu and to get back with her, but he misses the date when Khan has set up an ambush for a dreaded gangster.

However, the ambush goes wrong, and Adi chases Shiva, a seemingly armed and dangerous criminal, into a dead-end alley. Unsure if Shiva is, indeed, the wanted gangster, Adi has a moment of reckoning; whether to shoot or not to shoot. Whatever his decision is, every decision will take him on a journey that pits him against a system which demands a compromise of his morals. As he lives through the dramatic consequences of each decision, he realizes that every choice has its price.

Production and development
Director Amit Kumar stated that after he saw Robert Enrico's Oscar-winning short film An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge, he became interested and fascinated by the idea of human decision-making, and how quickly can one make a very difficult decision when one's life is at stake. This idea came to fruition in the form of Monsoon Shootout.

Kumar had previously assisted film director Asif Kapadia on his BAFTA-winning feature The Warrior where he met Trevor Ingman. Ingman decided to help seek finances for Kumar's film starting in 2008, but was unable to do so because of the closure of the UK Film Council which was initially supposed to cover half the production costs. Kumar set sights to find an Indian production partner, and in 2010, he ran into Guneet Monga who had produced Michael Winterbottom's Trishna. When Kumar stated his lack of an Indian producer, Monga immediately jumped at the opportunity to fund the film. However, the producers decided that although they loved Kumar's script and idea, they felt he needed to cast a star in the lead role. Kumar worked with Nawazuddin Siddiqui in his student short film The Bypass and decided to cast him in the lead role.

Reception
The Times of India's Lasyapriya Sundaram rated the film 3/5, praising the cinematography of Rajeev Ravi and Vijay Varma's debut performance in a lead role. She opines that ""while the idea hooks the viewer, what fails the film is its execution"", also critiquing that ""since the actors reprise their roles thrice over, they often don't have enough screen time to flesh out their characters adequately"".

Saibal Chatterjee writing in NDTV headlines the review saying, ""Nawazuddin Siddiqui's Noir Thriller Is Absorbing, Even Startling"". He describes the film as ""Shot through with stylistic flourishes and narrative sleights that frequently add up to arresting images and moments, first-time director Amit Kumar's niftily crafted Monsoon Shootout is absorbing, even startling. The propulsive, crisply edited noir thriller set in Mumbai's dark, dank and dangerous underbelly is consistently intriguing on account of its structure. Add to this the film's all-around technical finesse and the near-flawless performances from the principal actors and you have a crime drama that has the feel of a veritable tour de force."" He praises the score by Gingger Shankar, defining it as pulsating with the energy that adds a throbbing soundscape to the film. Rating it as 3/5, he recommends the film to viewers saying ""Don't prevaricate or duck for cover. Walk right into the path of this slickly staged shootout. You won't regret the decision.""

Shalini Langer writing in The Indian Express, finds the film somewhat lacking in consistency but overall praises the director, actors and especially the cinematographer Rajeev Ravi for capturing the unglamorous side of Mumbai in all its ambiguity.

Mint's Uditi Jhunjhunwala finds the film ""a technically accomplished, but emotionally wanting, noir thriller"".

Cannes reception
The film was shown during the French 2013 Cannes Film Festival in theMidnight Screenings section. Early Cannes reception for the film has been positive with many international critics taking a liking to the film's noir, artistic detailing.

British newspaper The Guardian'''s Peter Bradshaw gave a very positive first look review of the film stating that it's ""a brash exploitation picture, a violent thriller on the tough streets of Mumbai about rule-breaking, bone-breaking cops"" and ""an entertaining popcorn movie with a twist, for which commercial success is on the cards."" He described the film as ""Dirty Harry meets Sliding Doors.""The Hollywood Reporter'''s Deborah Young described the film as ""a ferocious Mumbai cops and gangsters drama, and a satisfyingly arty plot that turns in on itself to examine the outcome of three possible choices a rookie cop might make when he confronts a ruthless killer. Three times the story returns to a key moment: a boy with a gun uncertain whether to pull the trigger."" She had major praise for Nawazuddin Siddiqui's performance, stating that ""Most memorable of all is Siddiqui, who is every inch an unstoppable force of nature, and lucky we are that so much of the violence he wreaks happens off-camera.""

Soundtrack
The soundtrack was released by Saregama Music.

The film stars Vijay Sethupathi, who also produced the film, as a cop with a 100 percent hit rate in hostage situations, and he is called to save a school bus full of children during a monsoon. The film's origins can be traced back to 2015 when Kumar, an erstwhile assistant of Vetrimaaran, made a short film with Vijay titled Karuppu Vellai. It was well received and they decided to develop it into a feature film. However, due to Vijay's commitments to other projects, the film remained in the development hell until late 2018 when he agreed to produce the film under his newly launched banner, Vijay Sethupathi Productions. The film was shot in two schedules; the first schedule was shot in November 2019 in Chennai, while the second schedule was shot in March 2020 in Blessy. In between the two schedules, Vijay went on to complete his work on other films. The film's title was revealed in November 2019.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Luke Rhinehart"", the article should at least have 250 words","George Powers Cockcroft (November 15, 1932 – November 6, 2020), widely known by the pen name Luke Rhinehart, was an American novelist, screenwriter, and nonfiction writer with at least ten books to his name. He is best known for his 1971 novel The Dice Man, the story of a psychiatrist who experiments with making life decisions based on the roll of a die.

The Dice Man was critically well received and a commercial success. It quickly became and remains a cult classic.It was followed by two spiritual sequels in Adventures of Wim (1986) and The Search for the Dice Man (1993) as well as a companion volume called The Book of the Die (2000). Rhinehart wrote several other novels between 1986 and 2006 though none achieved the success of The Dice Man.

Early life
George Powers Cockcroft was born on November 15, 1932 in Albany, New York to Donald and Elizabeth Cockcroft, both college graduates, his mother from Wellesley College. He was raised in Albany, where his father was an electrical engineer, and his ancestry included Vermont political notables. He attended The Albany Academy, graduating in 1950, and received a BA from Cornell University in 1954 and an MA from Columbia University in 1956. In 1964 he received a PhD in American literature, also from Columbia. After obtaining his PhD, he went into teaching. During his years as a university professor he taught, among other things, courses in Zen and Western literature.

Career

In 1969, while Cockcroft was teaching a study abroad program on the island of Mallorca, an Englishman starting a new publishing house happened to stop at a cafe in the same village, Deià, and was given a partial manuscript of The Dice Man to read by Cockcroft. Cockcroft was subsequently offered an advance payment for publication. Shortly afterwards, Cockcroft was encouraged by his course Director to take an early sabbatical from his teaching duties. He remained in Mallorca to complete the novel, after which the publisher sold the American rights to the novel for a large sum, and within a year the film rights, allowing Cockcroft to retire from teaching and become a full time novelist.

Personal life and family

Cockroft married his wife, Ann, who would later become a writer of two romance novels and a volume of poetry, on June 30, 1956; together they have three children. His brother, James Cockcroft, is the author of more than 20 books, mostly on Latin American history and society.

The author and his family spent a number of years traveling, sailing, and returning to Mallorca, living in Deià in the late 1960s and early 70s, including time spent on a large catamaran which became the inspiration for the boat in his novel Long Voyage Back. In the mid 1970s they returned to the United States and spent 1975 in a sufi commune, before moving to a large old farmhouse and former religious retreat in the foothills of the Berkshires in upstate New York.

Death

On 1 August 2012, the ""death"" of Rhinehart at the age of 79 was announced by email to 25 friends, beginning with the words “It is our pleasure to inform you that Luke Rhinehart is dead”; it was later revealed the “Death Letter” was instigated as a playful hoax by Cockcroft. Reactions ranged from sorrow to gratitude and amusement.

Cockroft died in November 2020.

The Dice Man

Cockcroft has described the origin of the idea for this work variously, however, at the time of the publication of this work, ""it was not clear whether the book was fiction or autobiography"", all the more because its protagonist and author were eponymous, both were described as having the same profession (psychiatry), and elements of the described lives of both (e.g., places of residence, date of birth) were also in common; hence, curiosity over its authorship have persisted since its publication. Emmanuel Carrère, writing for The Guardian, presented a long-form expose on Cockcroft and the relationship between author and legend in 2019, and in following others, established the author Cockcroft as a life-long English professor living ""in an old farmhouse with a yard that slopes down to a duck pond"", a husband of fifty-years, father of three, and a caregiver to a special needs child.

The Dice Man was critically well received. It quickly became, and remains thought of as a cult classic. It initially sold poorly in the United States, but well in Europe, particularly England, Sweden, Denmark, and Spain. Writing in 2017 for The Guardian, Tanya Gold noted that ""over the course of 45 years"" it was still in print, had become famous, had devoted fans, and had ""sold more than 2m copies in multiple languages"" (e.g., as many as 27 languages and 60 countries have been claimed). In 1995, the BBC called it ""one of the fifty most influential books of the last half of the twentieth century,"" and in 1999, after one of their reporters experimented, controversially, with dicing, Loaded magazine named it ""Novel of the Century"". In 2013, Alex Clark of the Telegraph chose it as one of the fifty greatest cult books of the last hundred years.

Books After The Dice Man

Comic philosophical novels
A number of works authored by him have a similar style to The Dice Man and alternate between first- and third-person voice with selections from fictional documents.  In one case, he even quotes from a future book that he did not actually write until more than two decades later. The voices having different characteristics, the novel's mood changes accordingly.

Presenting these multiple fragments from multiple viewpoints together resulted in a ""cubist"" narrative structure. Of this, Rhinehart stated hat they had “ always conceived of myself as being multiple – having, you know, a dozen different selves, if not a thousand different selves, at any given moment.”

Adventures of Wim was an effort to create a new interpretation of the story of Wim, a Montauk boy born of a virgin mother, declared the savior of the Montauk nation, and his life quest for Ultimate Truth. The book is told through the medium of fictional documents.

The Search for the Dice Man (1993), set twenty years later, tells the story of Rhinehart's son, Larry, who has built a highly successful and stable life, having rejected his father's embracing of Chance.  On a quest to find his father however, Larry's life of order and routine becomes enveloped in chaos, the legacy of his father's work.

From a draft written at the same time as The Dice Man, Naked Before the World (2008) celebrates the lives of both hippies and the establishment in 1960s Mallorca through the story of Katya, an innocent Catholic art student who arrives on the island to study abroad. Katya is thrown into a world of artists, frauds, sex, drugs and the struggle to discover who she wants to be.

In Jesus Invades George: An Alternative History (2013), which takes place in 2007, then-sitting President George W. Bush is possessed by the spirit of Jesus Christ. The story playfully reveals and deconstructs the hypocrisy of government and modern politics.

In Invasion (2016), aliens invade Earth for the sole purpose of having fun. Hyper-intelligent and able to morph into multiple forms, they play games with culture and infrastructure, from computer networks and social media to corporate culture and human relationships. The resulting mayhem reveals the primitive nature of our society, and offers an alternative vision for the human race. A sequel is to be published entitled The Hairy Balls and the End of Civilization.

Conventional novels
In Matari (1975)  (republished as White Wind, Black Rider (2008)) is historical fiction set in 18th Century Japan, the beautiful Matari is joined by two zen poets as she flees from her husband, a samurai lord who is giving chase with intent to murder her. A lyrical and poetic tale of love, honor and morality.

Long Voyage Back (1983), a nautical action-adventure novel, follows a group of people sailing aboard a trimaran, and their struggle for survival as they escape the aftermath of nuclear war.

Nonfiction
The Book of est (1976) is a narrative account of Werner Erhard's controversial LGAT course  personal transformation course known as Erhard Seminar Training or est, which began in 1971. (Erhard insisted on using lower case letters for the acronym.) The reader is put in the place of a participant, in order to vicariously ""experience"" the training. Erhard authored a foreword to the book.

The Book of the Die (2000) is “handbook of dice living” intended to help free readers from barriers to an unfulfilled life. It follows the philosophy that people must give up their illusion that a self can control life; they must let go.  A collection of proverbs, essays, cartoons, poems, scenes from movies and more form this guide to creating a more playful and unpredictable life.

Other works

Screenplays
Though best known as a novelist, Rhinehart has also written nine screenplays: five are based directly on his novels: The Dice Man, The Search for the Dice Man, Whim, Naked Before the World, and White Wind, Black Rider. Two others are direct Dice Man sequels featuring the original character: The Dice Lady (co-written with Peter Forbes), and Last Roll of the Die (co-written with Nick Mead). Two other screenplays, Mawson and Picton's Chance, are original concepts.

Audio
The music and spoken word album, The Dice Man Speaks, on Dice Man Records, a new imprint of bizbro CREATIVE, features the pseudonymous Rhinehart and Sputnik Weazel and was released in 2018.  On it, Cockcroft/Rhinehart performs spoken word passages voiced over acoustic and electronic musical pieces by Weazel.

Antecedents and influence
To date there appears to be a single published scholarly work on the ideas appearing in Cockcroft's The Dice Man, a conference paper from Shanna Robinson of the Institute for Culture and Society at the University of Western Sydney in Australia; in addressing the popular accounts of Dickson on its having the ""impact of religious conversion on millions"" and the suggestion, again in popular media (by Dickson and Adams), that the dicing theme was, at that time, ""enjoying a renaissance"", Robinson writes:Although acknowledged that there has been no research at this point establishing the veracity of this, a number of other manifestations of dicing lend some credibility to the idea that it enjoys a certain level of popularity.

Also, the starting point for David Colton's 2019 PhD thesis, ″Canned Chance, The commodification of aleatory art practice″ is the Dice Man novel. The novel, and the use of dice and other tools for accessing chance are discussed here. See Manchester Metropolitan University, http://e-space.mmu.ac.uk/view/creators/Colton=3ADavid,_G=3A=3A.html

More generally, art exploring the application of chance or randomness in its expression is referred to as aleatoricism, and at least one academic, Richard Hoadley, a faculty member in Music and Performing Arts at Anglia Ruskin University in the United Kingdom, refers to the writings of Cockcroft/Rhinehart in their teaching on aleatoricism in art.

In popular culture

Music
A 1979 song by The Fall called ""Dice Man"" takes its title and general concept from the book.

The Talk Talk song, ""Such A Shame"", was inspired by The Dice Man.

The At The Gates song, ""World of Lies"", quotes The Dice Man during its spoken word lyrics.

Television and radio
Four seasons of a television travel series called The Diceman were made between 1998 and 2000 by the Discovery Channel. The destinations and activities of the participants were determined by the roll of a die.

UK Channel 4's broadcast of Diceworld (1999, Paul Wilmshurst directing), a 50-minute television documentary about Cockcroft/Rhinehart and some of the people influenced by his novels, led to a resurgence of interest in Cockcroft/Rhinehart's books, and in various related ""dicing projects"". A further documentary was produced in 2004, a collaboration between Cockcroft/Rhinehart and director Nick Mead, entitled Dice Life: The Random Mind of Luke Rhinehart.

Theater
Inspired by The Dice Man and written by Paul Lucas, the play The Dice House premiered in the United Kingdom in 2001, and went on to staging at the Arts Theatre in London's West End in 2004.

Magazines and books
Controversially, journalist Ben Marshall spent two years from 1998 to 2000 experimenting with dicing, and reporting his experiences in Loaded magazine; Loaded subsequently named Cockcroft/Rhinehart as novelist of the century.

Murder mystery author Terry Mitchell often uses characters who throw dice to make decisions, and in his own personal life, Mitchell created the ""dice road trip"", ""dicing to eat"", and ""The Sacred Journey"", each of which used dice to make decisions about life decisions.

Comics and related media
The UK comic, 2000 AD, published the Gamebook magazine title, Dice Man, in 1986; in total 5 editions were created by Pat Mills through October of that year, with script and game by Mills, covers by Glenn Fabry, and with art and lettering done by various individuals at 2000 AD. The relationship between this comic title and the similarly titled Cockcroft work has been established.

Advertising
The brewers of Rolling Rock beer launched an advertising campaign in the United Kingdom in 1998 based on The Dice Man theme, a campaign that included a short-lived Dice Life website. The relationship between this campaign and Cockcroft's work has been established.

Art
San Francisco artist Larnie Fox created War Toys, ""an exhibit of kinetic sound sculptures"", for which an activity, ""The Dicewalk"", inspired by Cockcroft's work, was part of its closing ceremony.

Born in Germany, Rhinehart was raised in the United States and attended college at the University of Wisconsin. He then attended medical school at the University of California, San Francisco. He completed his residency in New York City and fellowship in London. After residency, he joined the U.S. Public Health Service as a researcher at the National Institutes of Health, where he studied the effects of radiation on mice. In 1967, after two years of research, he left the Public Health Service to write fiction full-time. His first works were two novels, The Book of the Die and The Concrete River, neither of which were commercially successful. In 1970, he published The Dice Man, which became a surprise bestseller. The book's title refers to the die that the narrator uses to make decisions, and the story is a fictionalized autobiography. The book was a critical success and was adapted into a movie starring Richard Dreyfuss. In 1978, he published the novel The Search, which was not as commercially successful as The Dice Man, but was critically acclaimed. In 1982, he published the non-fiction book, The Book of Lists, which was a collection of lists that he had created for his own personal use. In 1984, he published the novel, Whack Job, which was a return to the style of The Dice Man and was also commercially successful.

Cities in the 657 and 714 area codes include Tustin, Placentia, Anaheim, Buena Park, Costa Mesa (unique because it is split between the 714/657 and 949 area codes, at Wilson Street and along Newport Boulevard), Cypress, Fountain Valley, Fullerton, Orange, Garden Grove, Santa Ana, Villa Park, Yorba Linda, portions of La Habra, and most of Brea and Huntington Beach.

The original area code, 714, was split from area code 213 as a flash-cut in 1951. Originally, it included most of Southern California, generally south and east of Los Angeles, extending to the Arizona and Nevada state lines to the east, and south as far as the Mexican border (what is now area codes 442/760, 619, 858, 909, and 951). Despite Southern California's explosive growth in the second half of the 20th century, this configuration remained in place for 31 years.

Finally, on January 1, 1982, most of the southern and eastern portion, centered around San Diego and the desert areas, became area code 619. In 1992, eastern Los Angeles and the Inland Empire became area code 909. On April 18, 1998, the southern cities of Orange County were split from 714, creating area code 949. 

By 2007, 714 was running out of numbers due to Southern California's continued growth and the proliferation of cell phones and pagers. As a solution, area code 657 was overlaid onto the 714 territory on September 23, 2008.

The two area codes now cover northern and western Orange County (except for portions of La Habra and all of Seal Beach, Los Alamitos, the far northwestern portion of Brea, and the western portions of La Palma, which have always been in the same area code as Long Beach—currently the 562 area code). This is probably because at the time those splits first occurred, while most cities in Southern California were provided primary local telephone service from what was then Pacific Bell (now AT&T), the cities listed above were served by GTE, the primary telephone provider for Long Beach (this territory has since become part of Verizon, and now Frontier).

Today, five cities ""straddle"" the 657/714 and 949 area codes: Costa Mesa, Irvine, Santa Ana, Tustin, and Newport Beach.

657 and 714"," Area codes 714 and 657 The 714 area code is a California telephone area code that was split from the 949 area code in 1998. It covers northern Orange County, California, except for the city of Anaheim, which is now part of the 657 area code. In the early 1990s, the suburban cities in the northern part of Orange County grew at a much faster rate than the rest of the county, so the 714 area code was created to relieve the 949 area code. The 714 area code has been one of the fastest-growing area codes in the United States. The 657 area code is a California telephone area code that was created on September 2, 2016, as a split from the 714 area code. It covers the cities of Anaheim, Fullerton, and Santa Ana. In 2015, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) approved a split of the 714 area code, in which the 657 area code would serve the same geographic area currently served by the 714 area code. The CPUC found that the 714 area code had run out of numbers for the region, due to the area's rapid growth. The CPUC had originally considered a three-way split of the 714 area code, which would have created the 638 and 657 area codes and made the 637 area code a supplement to the 638 area code. The CPUC ultimately decided on a two-way split, due to the 637 area code's small size and projected growth. The 657 area code became effective on September 2, 2016, and the 714 area code became effective on March 3, 2017.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,1597327,0.0189873417721519,0.08421052631578947,0.15409054805401112,0.17289719626168223,6,2,1,0,2,1,1,0,0,1,0.07997227536026141,0.026257069275843117,0.028859431096382216,0.02702702702702703,4,0,6,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,13,1,16,1,1,0
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Ashburn Alley"", the article should at least have 250 words","Ashburn Alley is the open concourse behind center field at Citizens Bank Park, home of the Philadelphia Phillies. It is named after Hall of Famer Richie Ashburn, Phillies center fielder from 1948 to 1959, and was also a long time broadcaster for the Phillies from 1963 until his death in September 1997. Ashburn Alley spans from the left field gate to ""The Yard"" kids area, and features a ""street-fair"" like atmosphere before and during a game.

Ashburn Alley's name sake began while Ashburn was still playing. During the Phillies playing days at old Shibe Park, Ashburn was known for dropping bunts down the third baseline, which had slightly overgrown grass that helped the ball stay fair. A bronze statue of Ashburn lies in the center of the alley.

Features

Ashburn Alley serves as a history lesson of baseball in Philadelphia. Granite markers on the walk-way feature every Phillies all-star since the first game in 1933. Another feature of Ashburn Alley is Memory Lane. Memory Lane is located directly behind the batter's eye, and gives an extensive look at the history of Philadelphia baseball. It features the history of the Phillies, the history of Philadelphia Athletics, and history of Negro league teams in the city. At the end of the Memory Lane section offers a great view of the stadiums' two tiered bullpen. The upper bullpen, in particular, pulls snug against the concourse.

On the western end of the Alley is Bull's BBQ, named after former Phillies slugger Greg ""The Bull"" Luzinski, who also operates it. Bull's BBQ is an outdoor picnic section and serves barbecue pork sandwiches, chicken, and most notably ribs. Luzinski is at most of the games and often socializes with fans.

On top of the concession buildings in the center of the Alley is the Rooftop Bleachers. This area of the stadium was influenced by the old rooftop seats at the Phillies and Athletics old home Shibe Park. It was common during the 1920s for residents who lived in the rowhouses across from the ballpark to watch the games for free on their rooftops.

There are many concession stands featuring Philadelphia cuisine staples such as the cheesesteak, at both Tony Luke's and Campo's. The Alley also features the '47 Brand store, which sells classic Phillies apparel, classic pennants and banners, and other items.

Sports in Philadelphia"," Ashburn Alley is the unofficial name for an urban pedestrian walkway in Downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It is a narrow, one-lane cobblestone street that connects Grant Street with Oliver Avenue, running parallel to and between Liberty Avenue and Sixth Avenue. It is a well-known and frequently photographed location in the city, and is often included in city tours. The alley is lined with restaurants, pubs, and nightclubs, and is a popular destination for nightlife. It is often referred to as ""Pitt Street"" by locals, although that name is not officially recognized. The alley is closed to traffic and is occasionally used for public events, such as the Three Rivers Regatta. The alley was originally a street called Liberty Lane, and was one of the first streets in the city to be paved. It was renamed for John Ashburn, a local businessman who owned a pawnshop and was killed in the line of duty while serving as a volunteer firefighter.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Inez Y. Kaiser"", the article should at least have 250 words","Inez Yeargan Kaiser (April 22, 1918 – July 31, 2016) was an American educator, public relations expert, and entrepreneur. She was the first African-American woman to run a public relations company with national clients.

Early life and education
Kaiser was born in Kansas City, Kansas. She grew up in a time when African Americans in the South were not allowed the opportunity of a higher education. But she was determined to gain an education. Her father told her ""no one can take away from you what’s in your head.”

Kaiser earned a bachelor's degree in education from Pittsburg State University in 1941. Later, she earned a master's degree from Columbia University. She also studied at Chicago University, Rockhurst University, and Dartmouth College. She also undertook special training in radio and TV network, retailing and merchandising in fashions.

Career
Kaiser taught home economics for more than 20 years in public schools. In 1957, she founded Inez Kaiser & Associates, which was both the first public relations firm led by an African-American woman and the first business owned by an African American to open in Kansas City. By the early 1960s, after securing 7 Up and other big accounts, she had become the first African-American woman to run a public relations firm with national clients. She was the first African-American woman to join the Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce and the Public Relations Society of America, the profession's trade association.

Writing career
Kaiser began writing a column, ""Fashion Wise and Otherwise"", as a hobby, but she became so interested in helping other African-American women that she devoted several years to contacting publishers across the country, as well as promoting the use of pictures of models of color, giving them employment in areas where they had never been considered before. She wrote a column in The Kansas City Star titled ""As I See It"".

Kaiser also wrote a cookbook titled Soul Food Cookery, which was published in 1960.

Political views
Kaiser was a life-long Republican, and she advised the Nixon and Ford administrations on issues related to minority women and business. According to her son, she voted for Barack Obama.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Ballet Shoes (novel)"", the article should at least have 250 words","Ballet Shoes: A Story of Three Children on the Stage is a children's novel by Noel Streatfeild, published by Dent in 1936. It was her first book for children, and was illustrated by the author's sister, Ruth Gervis. Diane Goode illustrated a 1991 edition published by Random House.

Ballet Shoes was a commended runner up for the inaugural Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year's best British children's book by a British subject. (The author would win the award later for another book.)

Plot summary
The book concerns three adopted sisters, Pauline, Petrova and Posy Fossil.  Each of the girls is discovered as a baby by Matthew Brown (Great-Uncle-Matthew, known as ""Gum""), an elderly, absentminded palaeontologist and professor, during his world travels, and sent home to his great-niece, Sylvia and her childhood nanny, Nana.

Gum embarks upon an expedition of many years and arranges for money to support the family while he is gone. Gum does not return in the promised five years and the money is almost gone. As they have no way to contact or track him down, Sylvia and Nana take in boarders to make ends meet, including Mr. Simpson and his wife, Dr. Jakes and Dr. Smith, a pair of tutors who take over the children's schooling after Sylvia can no longer afford their school fees, and Miss Theo Dane, a dance teacher who arranges for the children to begin classes at the Children's Academy of Dancing and Stage Training.

Pauline finds she has a talent and passion for acting while Petrova hates acting and dancing. Posy has a real talent for dancing. When she is about six, Madame Fidolia, a famous and retired Russian dancer, gives Posy private lessons, something she has never done before. As the children mature, they take on some of the responsibility of supporting the household. Much of the drama comes from the friction between the sisters and from balancing their desire to help support the family financially against the laws limiting the amount of time they may spend on stage. When Pauline is picked for a lead part, the early success goes to her head, because of which the producer replaces her with her understudy (although only for a single performance, not permanently as portrayed in the 2007 film). Through this, Pauline learns enough humility to balance her talent, and goes on to play many successful lead parts.

Posy is developing into a brilliant ballet dancer. She also clashes with her sisters, as she is so focused on dancing that she is insensitive about anything that gets in her way. Petrova is not interested in the performing arts and has little talent for it but must keep attending classes and performing to help support the family. However, she holds onto her own dream of flying aircraft.

The book ends with Pauline going off to Hollywood to make a film, accompanied by Sylvia. Posy is going to a ballet school in Prague, accompanied by Nana. Petrova wonders what will become of her, as she is still too young to live on her own and doesn't want to dance or act. At this moment, Gum arrives. He has been away so long that he doesn't realise who the three girls are at first, but after recognising that they are the three babies he left all those years ago, he decides he will take Petrova under his wing and help her achieve her dream.

Characters

Gum  Great-Uncle Matthew Brown, an elderly geologist and professor, who finds the three sisters during his travels. Gum is Sylvia's great uncle and later guardian after her parents die.
Sylvia Brown  Gum's great-niece, known to the girls as ""Garnie"", short for Guardian. Sylvia is a practical and caring woman. Sylvia's father died at the beginning of the book and she and her mother moved in with Gum. When Sylvia was 16 her mother died.
Nana  Alice Gutheridge, Sylvia's stern nurse. Called ""Nana"" by family and friends alike.
Pauline Fossil  The eldest sister by two years, rescued from a shipwreck.  A talented actress and a great beauty, with an independent, bumptious streak.
Petrova Fossil  The middle sister, adopted from a young couple who died in Russia.  Petrova is a tomboy, hardworking and diligent, but interested only in engines and aeroplanes and cars.
Posy Fossil  The youngest sister by two years, whom Gum sends to the house by district messenger in a basket with a pair of ballet shoes.  Her mother, a dancer, may well be alive, as it is said she 'has no time for babies' at the time of Posy's adoption.  Posy is considered a child dance prodigy, though she was still too young to perform on stage at the book's conclusion.
Dr. Jakes and Dr. Smith  Boarders.  A pair of retired professors of literature and maths, respectively, who offer to teach the girls.  Dr. Jakes first inspires the girls to think of their adoptive state as being full of potential and individuality, without any chance of their achievements being attributed to family connections.
Mr. and Mrs. Simpson  Boarders.  Mr. Simpson is particularly friendly with Petrova, on account of his Citroën car and auto-repair garage. In the 2007 film adaptation Mrs. Simpson's character was abandoned so that Mr. Simpson could serve as a love interest for Sylvia.
Miss Theodora ""Theo"" Dane  The last boarder.  An impractical dance teacher at the Children's Academy of Classical Ballet.
Madame Fidolia  A retired Russian prima ballerina of the old Russian empire.  Now head of the Children's Academy of Dancing and Stage Training.  Posy's teacher and mentor.
Winifred  A fellow student at the Children's Academy.  Though considered the best all-round pupil at the Academy, she often loses major roles on account of her plain looks and inadequate clothing, the latter a result of her large family's poverty.  Winifred is both a particular friend and rival of Pauline.

Television adaptations

Ballet Shoes has twice been adapted for the screen, both by the BBC:
Ballet Shoes in 1975, starring Elizabeth Morgan, Sarah Prince, and Jane Slaughter as the sisters.
Ballet Shoes in 2007, starring Emma Watson, Yasmin Paige, and Lucy Boynton as the sisters.

In popular culture
 The Shoes books are mentioned in the film You've Got Mail by Meg Ryan's character, a bookstore owner.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""W National Park massacre"", the article should at least have 250 words","On February 8, 2022, two African Parks patrol vehicles in Benin's W National Park were badly damaged by land mines, killing eight people. The incident, believed to have been perpetrated by Islamists, was one of the largest terrorist attacks in the country's history.

Background 
Benin is more stable than most other countries in West Africa, and is one of the few nations to not have a major terrorism problem. However, beginning in late 2021, terrorism began to creep in from abroad, especially from the Sahel, which is to the north. In December 2021, the Porga attack occurred when gunmen (probably from Burkina Faso, which has a jihadist insurgency), raided a military outpost near the town of Porga in Atakora Department, killing two soldiers. In January 2022, a military vehicle collided with an improvised explosive device, killing two people.

Massacre 
On February 8, 2022, a patrol vehicle in W National Park was scouting for poachers when their vehicles hit two land mines planted by the terrorists. Of the eight people killed in the explosion, five were park rangers, one a park official, another a French law enforcement officer, and the other a soldier. Ten people were injured.

Aftermath 
French authorities agreed to launch an investigation after learning that a French citizen was among the dead. African Parks issued a statement that they were working with French and Beninese authorities in response to the massacre. Beninese troops were sent to the park to maintain order. Government authorities also held a meeting to discuss the attack.

On February 10, another roadside bombing killed a civilian and a park ranger. The ranger initially survived the bombing but died after he was attacked by the perpetrators.

On February 10, the French Armed Forces airstriked a base held by Jihadist rebels in Southern Burkina Faso. The official motive given was retaliation for the massacre.

Terrorist incidents in Africa in 2022"," W National Park massacre The W National Park massacre took place on 2 November 2007 in South Africa's W National Park, a protected area in the North West province. A group of thirty-eight unarmed South African soldiers was ambushed by four armed poachers, three of whom were killed when the soldiers returned fire. The soldiers suffered no casualties. The incident was the first time that South African soldiers had been involved in a shooting incident in a national park. The soldiers were on a routine patrol in the park when they came across the poachers. The poachers opened fire on the soldiers, who returned fire. The poachers were armed with assault rifles, and the soldiers were armed with R4 assault rifles and shotguns. A shootout ensued, and the poachers were killed. The soldiers then called for backup, and a team of park rangers arrived to assist them. The soldiers were from the South African National Defence Force's (SANDF) 1 Military Hospital, based in Pretoria. They were on a routine patrol in the park, which is located in the North West province, near the border with Botswana. The poachers were from Zimbabwe. They had entered South Africa through Botswana and were headed to Johannesburg, where they planned to sell the animals they had poached. The SANDF said that the soldiers had acted in self-defence, and that the poachers had opened fire first. The soldiers had fired back with their R4 rifles, and the poachers had been killed in the shootout. The soldiers had suffered no casualties. The SANDF said that the soldiers' actions were in line with the military's code of conduct, which states that soldiers may use force if they feel their lives are in danger. The SANDF also said that the soldiers had acted professionally and that the incident was under investigation. The South African Police Service (SAPS) said that it was investigating the incident, and that it would decide whether to press charges against the soldiers after the investigation was complete. The SANDF and the SAPS have been criticised for their handling of the incident. Some have argued that the soldiers should not have opened fire on the poachers, as they were unarmed and the soldiers were in a protected area. Others have argued that the soldiers acted appropriately, as they were in danger and needed to defend themselves.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,70072992,0.06962025316455696,0.2,0.18136086841408525,0.3629283489096573,2,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0.17574915867369742,0.02433338896849699,0.0040044186688760015,0.028255528255528257,3,4,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,6,1,7,1,1,1

Railway stations in Australia opened in 1915"," Mount Druitt railway station is a heritage-listed railway station located on the Main Western line in Mount Druitt, New South Wales, Australia. The property was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. The station is located 72 kilometres (45 mi) from Sydney Central station. The station was built in 1884 and is the second station to have been built on this site. The original station was a simple bog standard design, however in the early 20th century it was decided that the station needed to be upgraded to a more substantial design. The station was subsequently rebuilt in concrete with a barrel roofed platform shelter and a distinctive and unique signal box, which is one of the few to have been built in that style in the state. The station was closed in 1991 due to the construction of the Mount Druitt Hospital and the subsequent rerouting of the Main Western line. The station was then subsequently rebuilt in 1998 to the same design as the original, with the signal box being relocated to Blacktown. The station is now the terminating point for the Blacktown-Mount Druitt via Richmond service.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,1998897,0.015189873417721522,0.06315789473684211,0.15403759597564204,0.05763239875389408,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0.4844854837939749,0.021749093593790608,0.028030930682132006,0.009828009828009828,4,0,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,5,1,10,1,1,1

Todd was born in Detroit, Michigan, the son of Ellen (née Fournier) and James R. Todd. He attended Catholic schools in Michigan, and graduated from Detroit's Mackenzie High School in 1960. He went on to earn a bachelor's degree from the University of Michigan in 1964 and an M.B.A. from the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan in 1966. In 1968, Todd moved to Vermont and settled in Woodstock, where he became a partner in a successful business, the Woodbury Corporation. The firm's primary business was buying, improving, and selling hotels. In 1985, Todd and his partners sold their hotels, and Todd turned to politics. A Republican, Todd ran for the Vermont House of Representatives in 1986, but was defeated by incumbent Democrat Margaret Flory. In 1988, he was elected to the Vermont Senate from the three-member at-large Washington County District, and he was re-elected in 1990.

As governor, Todd focused on making Vermont a ""granite state,"" promoting tourism and the state's heritage. In his first year in office, Todd proposed a reduction in the state's income tax rate, but the legislature rejected the idea. Todd also proposed legislation to reduce the state's cigarette tax, but the bill was defeated in the state Senate. In 1998, Todd was re-elected governor, defeating Democrat Peter Shumlin, the future governor, by a margin of 3,617 votes. In 2000, Todd was again re-elected, defeating Democrat James Douglas, the future governor, by a margin of 2,hi votes. In 2002, Todd did not run for re-election, and Douglas was elected governor.

Aethwy covers the communities of Llanfair Pwllgwyngyll, Menai Bridge and Penmynydd. The ward elects three county councillors to the Isle of Anglesey County Council.  Aethwy is bordered to the southwest by Bro Rhosyr and to the northeast by the Seiriol ward.

The Aethwy ward was created following the Isle of Anglesey electoral boundary changes in 2012, which created 11 multi-councillor wards from 40 single-councillor wards. The new ward replaced the former county wards of Braint, Cadnant, Gwyngyll and Tysilio, which each elected one county councillor. Penmynydd was part of the Llanfihangel Ysgeifiog county ward.

Elections results 
At the inaugural May 2013 county elections the ward poll was topped by Independent councillor Jim Evans. Plaid Cymru candidates, Alun Mummery and Meirion Jones, came second and third. The turnout was 49.1%.

Councillor Evans, a sub-postmaster from Llanfair PG, was elected as chairman of Anglesey County Council for 2015/16.

At the May 2017 county elections, Plaid Cymru won all three Aethwy seats. Councillors Jones and Mummery came first and third respectively, with Robin Wyn Williams in second place.

Wards of Anglesey"," Aethwy (electoral ward) Aethwy (electoral ward) is an electoral ward in the community of Menai Bridge on the Isle of Anglesey, Wales. It covers the village of Llangoed and the western part of the island's capital, Bangor. Aethwy is the Welsh word for 'Aettyn' (a corruption of 'Ahitan' or 'Aetna'), an ancient Roman settlement which had a fort and a naval port, both of which have been excavated. The area is also known as Caerwysg, after a 13th-century Welsh castle which was built to protect the Menai straits. The ward includes the main shopping area and the University of Wales, Bangor. It is also the location of the Princess Royal University Hospital, a large psychiatric hospital. Aethwy ward is bounded by the wards of Gyffin to the north, Seiriol to the east, and Menai to the south. It is represented by three county councillors on the Isle of Anglesey County Council. It has also been the name of a parliamentary constituency, see Aethwy (UK Parliament constituency).

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Catstye Cam"", the article should at least have 250 words","Catstye Cam is a fell in the English Lake District. It is an outlier of Helvellyn in the Eastern Fells.

Name
The name of the fell is also given as 'Catstycam', a spelling preferred by Alfred Wainwright in his influential Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells. A third variant, 'Catchedicam', is also quoted by him. Other guidebooks such as Collins Landranger and Birkett  follow Wainwright with 'Catstycam', although the maps of the Ordnance Survey always use 'Catstye Cam'.

Topography
The Helvellyn range runs broadly north to south for about 7 miles, remaining above 2,000 ft (600 m) throughout its length. Helvellyn itself sits near the centre of this ridge and displays the characteristic form of many of these fells, namely smooth grassy slopes to the west and shattered rock to the east. Helvellyn sends out two eastward arêtes, razor-thin ridges between deep mountain corries. The southerly spur is Striding Edge, easily the most famous ridge in the district, and its northern partner is Swirral Edge. From the summit plateau of Helvellyn a rough slope drops to the start of Swirral Edge, and this narrow ridge curves gracefully down and then back up over half a mile, terminating at Catstye Cam.

Taking on the classic mountain shape of a pyramid, Catstye Cam draws the eye in any view where the overtopping bulk of Helvellyn is hidden behind. As Wainwright said ""If Catstycam stood alone, remote from its fellows, it would be one of the finest peaks in Lakeland. It has nearly, but not quite, the perfect mountain form with true simplicity in its soaring lines, and a small pointed top, a real summit that falls away on all sides"". Even with the connection to Helvellyn, Catstye Cam still has a prominence of over 200 ft due to the pronounced bow of Swirral Edge. High Spying How on Striding Edge, by comparison, is nothing but a rock turret, an independent peak in almost no-one's estimation.

East of the summit the ridge declines quickly to Red Tarn Beck, whilst there is a third ridge to the north west, giving Catstye Cam a triangular plan. To the north, between the two descending ridges, is an area of crag. The other two faces are steep but smooth.

South of Catstye Cam, nestling between the encircling arms of Helvellyn's two edges, is Red Tarn. This pool is named for the colour of the surrounding screes rather than its water, and contains brown trout and schelly, a fresh-water herring. The depth of Red Tarn is now about 80 ft, although in the mid-19th century it was dammed with boulders to increase capacity. This was carried out to provide additional water to the Greenside Mine in Glenridding, the water race still visible as it crosses the slope of Birkhouse Moor.

A second tarn once existed in Brown Cove to the north at Catstye Cam, but this is now reduced to a couple of small pools widening the stream. Brown Cove Tarn was another creation of the Greenside mine, a stone faced dam being built in about 1860. The dam is still in place but water now leaks through the base, the extended tarn-bed a smooth patch of luxuriant turf. A water leat passing beneath the north face of Catstye Cam to Red Tarn Beck can still be traced although it is now in ruins. Water from Brown Cove and Red Tarn unites at the base of the east ridge to form Glenridding Beck, flowing on through the village to Ullswater.

Geology
The principal rock type is the dacitic lapilli-tuff of the Helvellyn Formation.

Summit
The summit of Catstye Cam is small and neat, bearing only a tiny cairn. The view is extensive and even the looming Helvellyn only adds to the drama by showing its eastern face in close detail. Striding Edge is also seen in profile across Red Tarn, lines of pilgrims frequently queueing at the bottlenecks. By contrast Catstye Cam is often almost completely deserted.

Ascents

Catstye Cam is normally climbed from Glenridding, either by its east or north west ridges. Both are steep, but there are no technical difficulties. A fair path also climbs via Red Tarn to the midpoint of Swirral Edge, from where a brief detour back to the summit can be made. By far the best option is a circular tour via Striding and Swirral Edges. This takes in Birkhouse Moor, Helvellyn and Catstye Cam, one of the most breathtaking walks in the country.

Patterdale"," Catstye Cam is a large, circular depression in the moorland of eastern North Yorkshire, England, between the villages of Spaunton and Brandsby. Its circumference is about one mile (1.6 km). Its name is a corruption of the term ""catt stey"", meaning ""steep bank"". In 2018, it was mown for the first time in 40 years. The Cam is formed by a large depression in the limestone, which is now largely infilled with clay and other deposits. At the lowest point, the Cam is crossed by the A166 road. On the northern side of the road, the Cam becomes a small, shallow lake, which is often filled with water in the winter. The southern side is dominated by a large, steep bank, which is covered in mature oak trees. The whole site is designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). The Cam is a popular spot for walking and horse riding. It also attracts birdwatchers, who can observe birds such as the great crested grebe, the water rail, the common kingfisher, the northern shoveler, the tufted duck, the common goldeneye, and the lesser black-backed gull.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,1095285,0.10516066212268745,0.08421052631578947,0.23716421254149608,0.04361370716510903,1,5,0,0,3,1,1,0,0,0,0.15628917519214316,0.025596573937586457,0.0009665838166252416,0.030712530712530713,5,0,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,1,13,1,1,1

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Clarence Drive"", the article should at least have 250 words","Clarence Drive is a mountain pass crossed by the R44 road between Gordon's Bay and Rooi-Els. The tourist route is 22 km long and provides a panoramic view of False Bay, the coastline, Table Mountain, and parts of the Cape Peninsula. The nearby coast is popular with anglers and whale watchers, and Kogel Bay Resort is particularly sought after by surfers.

The drive follows the east coast of False Bay in Western Cape, South Africa, and connects Strand with Hangklip to the south, similarly to Chapman's Peak Drive.

History 
In the past, supplies had to be shipped to Rooi-Els and walked up the pass by drovers. Businessman Gerald ""Jack"" Clarence, who owned property in Hangklip and Betty's Bay, proposed building a road through the area, which would begin construction in 1940 and would be completed by Italian POWs during World War II. On May 29, 1998, Premier of the Western Cape Gerald Morkel opened reconstructed portions of the road. Overlooks have been built, but there are still some sharp turns and rockslides sometimes occur.

The road 
The road begins near Gordon's Bay, winds south over the mouth of the Steenbras River and proceeds past Kogel Bay, Sparks' Bay, and Rooi-Els to near Pringle Bay. Here the pathway forks, with one road going near Cape Hangklip and the other lifting it to Betty's Bay.

It is a scenic route, following the mountainside to the south of the bay, offering views of the sea to the south and the mountains to the north. The road was originally a railway line, and the route was planned by the engineer Sir William George Murray, who was responsible for many of the country's early railway lines. The first train ran on the line in 1890. The line was later extended to Strand, and a branch line to Simon's Town was also constructed. The train service was initially provided by the Cape Government Railways, and later by the South African Railways. The last train ran on the line in July 2006, after which the line was closed and the road was upgraded to a scenic route. The road is named after Prince Clarence, the third son of King William IV.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Monte Titano"", the article should at least have 250 words","Monte Titano (""Mount Titan"") is a mountain of the Apennines and the highest peak in San Marino. It stands  above sea level and is located immediately to the east of the capital, San Marino. It was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2008 under the combined title ""San Marino Historic Centre and Mount Titano"". Inscribed under reference no. 1245 criteria iii, the two together encompass an area of 55 ha with a buffer zone of 167 ha. It encompasses Mount Titano and the other structures such as the fortification towers, walls, gates and bastions, as well as a neo-classical basilica located on it and its slopes forming a small but unique urban conglomerate.

Straddled on the ridge of  Mount Titano is the city of San Marino of the Republic of San Marino, the history of which dates from the early 4th century. According to the legend related to the Mount and its precincts, a small monastery existed on top of the Mount during the 8th century. The mountainous landscape provides excellent views of its surroundings, and its isolated location ensured the needed seclusion for San Marino to survive as a Republic over the past several centuries.

The mountain has three peaks; on each is one of The Three Towers of San Marino. Saint Marinus is always represented with Mount Titano in his hands.

Geography and environment
Monte Titano is located in central San Marino (seen in maps in rough rectangular shape), to the southeast of the City of San Marino and to the north of the village of Murata, at a distance of  from the Adriatic Coast. Monte Titano looks like a rugged limestone outcrop, located only 13 kilometres (a figure of 10 km is mentioned in another reference) from the Adriatic Sea on the Apennines. Although the highest point is 739 metres above sea level, the rocky outcrop is about 200 metres in height at most. From the top of Monte Titano views of the entire nation of San Marino and further afield can be viewed scenically. The mountain gives birth to several streams, including the San Marino River, which flows down its western slope through a broad valley and flows into the Marecchia River, through Marecchia Torello and into the Adriatic Sea  away and the Cando River, born in Marano, which flows into the Adriatic coast between Rimini and Riccione Ausa. The terrain has fertile soils in Emilia Romagna plain and soft rolling hills in the Marche and Montefeltro region. The mountain dips into the calm Adriatic sea.

During the Tertiary era, the area where San Marino lies was the sea. Violent earthquakes caused major upheavals in the Earth's surface. Because of these intensive earthquakes, a mass of rock situated about  from the mountain, was lifted and slid slowly toward the Adriatic Sea. This mass of rock gave rise to various mountains, including Mount Titano. The vertebrate fossils found on the slopes of Mount Titano are mostly aquatic in origin, because of the fact this rock was once located underneath the sea in its current spot. Fossils of various fish, especially the fossils of shark teeth have been discovered on Monte Titano, with many dated to the Miocene period. The most important fossil discovery is that of a whale, which is now preserved in the Bologna Archaeological Museum.

The precincts of Monte Titano and the San Marino city experiences mild temperate climate; the maximum temperatures reported is of 79 °F (26 °C) in summer while the minimum is 19 °F (−7 °C) in winter. Annual precipitation varies from about 22 inches (560 mm) to 32 inches (800 mm).

Flora and fauna
Set in the Mediterranean zone the vegetation is typical influenced by elevation variations. Numerous trees inhabit the mountain, including chestnuts, oaks, laburnum, cypress, fir trees and some shrubs and asparagus, typical of the driest areas, such as the territory in the Three Towers of San Marino vicinity. On the cliffs of Mount Titano is also found Ephedra Nebrodensis, a plant typical of Sicily and Sardinia.

Wildlife is represented by all classes of vertebrates and, given the characteristics of the mountainous territory, birds and mammals are the most common animals. In relation to birds, several can be mentioned such as the kestrel, barn owl, owl, tawny owl, the magpie and buzzards.  Common animal life includes roe deer, wild boar, deer, weasels, marten, porcupine, hare, hedgehogs, polecats, badgers and foxes.

Protected area
Since 2008, Monte Titano was allocated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, in tandem with the historic centre of San Marino. The reason given by the Committee refers to ""witnessing the continuity of a free republic since Middle Ages. "" This heritage site include the towers, walls, gates and bastions of the City of San Marino, the Basilica di San Marino of the nineteenth century, some convents of the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries, the eighteenth century Teatro Titano Theatre and the Palazzo Pubblico of the nineteenth century.

Culture

The layout of the Mount Titano presents three peaks, each crowned by ancient towers named Guaita, Cesta and Montale, with triple fortifications that enclose the capital city. Each tower, in turn, has a metal vane fixed on it which is in the shape of an ostrich plume, (""perhaps a pun on the Italian penne, meaning ""plumes"") which is attributed to the name of the mountains. Those three towers are represented in the coat of arms in the central part of the National Flag (horizontal white and blue) of the country (which has a width to length ratio of 3 to 4). The capital city is set on the western side of Mount Titano. An urban network of roads links the fortresses.

Highest points of countries"," Monte Titano Monte Titano is a mountain of the Apennines, located in the northern part of the Abruzzo, Italy, just a few kilometres from the Adriatic Sea. It is the highest peak of the Gran Sasso e Monti della Laga National Park, the largest national park in Italy. The mountain has an altitude of 2,406 metres (7,997 ft) above sea level and is the highest peak in the Abruzzo region. It is also the highest non-volcanic peak in the Apennines. The peak is located in the municipality of Cosenza dei Pii, in the province of Teramo, about 50 kilometres (31 mi) from the city of Teramo. The northern side of the mountain is characterized by high and steep cliffs, while the southern side is instead formed by a gentle and wide slope, which allows an easy climb to the top. The mountain is the site of an annual endurance race, the ""Assolo Monte Titano"". The race starts at the bottom of the mountain, in the nearby town of Cosenza dei Pii, and the winner is the runner who first reaches the top. Since the beginning of the 20th century, a metallic statue of the Christ the Redeemer, a copy of the one in Rio de Janeiro, has been placed on the top of the mountain as a symbol of peace between the Christian and the Muslim worlds. The statue, placed on the top of a pedestal, is 6 metres (20 ft) high, with its arms outstretched and facing the city of Baghdad, in Iraq. The project to erect the statue was conceived by the Italian entrepreneur Michele Ferrero, of the Ferrero company, to whom the Iraqis had offered the same area of land in their country to erect the statue as a symbol of peace. The summit of the mountain can be reached by a hiking trail which starts from the city of Cosenza dei Pii and climbs through the ""La Salizzona"" area, then leads to the ""La Pedra"" area, from which the final climb to the top of the mountain begins. The total length of the trail is about 7 kilometres (4.3 mi), with a total climb of about 1,200 metres (3,900 ft) of elevation.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,7157834,0.12074001947419669,0.10526315789473684,0.30657216757296185,0.32398753894080995,4,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0.31432834450887676,0.03528390451957197,0.0038663352665009665,0.02334152334152334,5,0,8,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,6,1,12,1,1,1

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Courtney's and Steel's Post Cemetery"", the article should at least have 250 words","Courtney's and Steel's Post Cemetery is a Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery located near ANZAC Cove on the Gallipoli peninsula in Turkey.  It contains the graves of some of the former British Empire troops who died during the Gallipoli Campaign.

The campaign lasted eight months and was fought by British Empire and French forces against the Ottoman Empire in an attempt to force Turkey out of the war and to open a supply route to Russia through the Dardanelles and the Black Sea.

British, French and other Allied troops landed on the Gallipoli Peninsula on 25 April 1915 at Cape Helles in the south whilst Australian and New Zealand troops (the ANZAC corps) landed on the west coast. Courtney's Post was named after Lieutenant-Colonel Richard Courtney of the 14th Australian Infantry Battalion who took command of it on 27 April. Steel's Post, named after Major Thomas Steel was just to the South West of it.  Both positions were captured on the day of the landings and held until the Allies withdrew in December. The cemetery contains special memorials to 58 casualties believed to be buried amongst 160 unidentified graves.

Spelling
Steel's Post was officially, but incorrectly, named Steele's Post. The inscription on the cemetery follows this spelling and labels it Courtney's and Steele's Post  but the CWGC lists the cemetery as Courtney's and Steel's Post.

Notes

Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemeteries in Gallipoli"," Courtney's and Steel's Post Cemetery is a heritage-listed cemetery at 2A Courtneys Road, Carbrook, City of Logan, Queensland, Australia. It is also known as Carbrook Cemetery. It was established in 1901 and includes the graves of many of the district's pioneers. The cemetery is located on a 1.5-hectare (3.7-acre) site on a bend of the Logan River, just off the Beenleigh-Redland Bay Road. The cemetery was established following the deaths of two of the district's earliest settlers, William Courtney and George Steel. William Courtney died in 1901 and his wife, Mary, died the following year. They had come to the district in the 1860s and, with George Steel, had taken up a pastoral lease on what is now the Carbrook Golf Course. George Steel died in 1903, only a few months after the cemetery had been established. The cemetery is divided into two sections, one for Catholics and the other for Protestants. The dividing line is a row of trees, with the Catholic graves to the west and the Protestant graves to the east. There are no religious symbols on the headstones in either section. There are many interesting headstones in the cemetery. One headstone, that of Elizabeth Eva Mary Jones, who died in 1908, is built in the shape of a cross. The headstone of George William Jones, who died in 1916, is in the shape of a pillow with a gold-painted maple leaf on the top. The grave of Arthur O'Brien, who died in 1920, has a headstone in the shape of a book with a carved wooden cross on the top. The headstone of Percival Alfred George Courtney, who died in 1984, is in the shape of a house with a cross on the roof. There are also some interesting monuments in the cemetery. The memorial to the Courtney and Steel families is a large stone tablet set on a concrete base and surrounded by a wrought-iron fence. The tablet has a brass plaque on it and there are also six smaller brass plaques set into the concrete base. One of the smaller plaques is dedicated to the memory of ""Chrissie"" Steel, who died in 1978. She was the last member of the Steel family to be buried in the family's section of the cemetery. The Carbrook Cemetery is now closed for new graves, but it is still used for the interment of ashes. A small area has been set aside for the burial of pets.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,18735953,0.04339963833634718,0.21052631578947367,0.13340141457695073,0.3909657320872274,1,1,0,0,3,1,1,0,0,1,0.12057605832972276,0.018477465632973315,0.0016570008285004142,0.01597051597051597,3,3,2,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,1,1,1
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Christian courtship"", the article should at least have 250 words","Christian courtship, also known as Biblical courtship, is the traditional Christian practice of individuals in approaching ""the prospect of marriage"". Preceded by a proposal, courtship traditionally begins after a betrothal and concludes with the celebration of marriage (though in the present-day, courtship may precede the betrothal, which is then followed by the wedding). Christian theologian John Piper distinguished courtship from dating, teaching that:

Andre Marie, a brother of the Slaves of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, discusses that courtship allows a couple to become acquainted with one another, and that physical intimacy is saved only for those in wedlock. Christian minister Patricia Bootsma further delineates this distinction, writing that in contrast to the modern conception of dating, in ""courtship, time together in groups with family or friends is encouraged, and there is oversight by and accountability to parents or mentors"". She further states that with courtship, ""commitment happens before intimacy"". 

Christian courtship remains normative in certain Christian countries such as Guatemala, in which much of the population belongs to the Roman Catholic Church. In the United States, courtship is seen as a response to secular dating culture in which various Christian communities might find themselves, c. 1985 to present. Motivated by concern for the need of Christian values in contrast to secular dating practices, conservative Christians identified what they saw as key Biblical principles for courtship and romance, and began to disseminate them in the 1980s.

The practice of traditional Christian courtship among church members belonging to various Christian denominations experienced a revival in the 1980s. Keynote speaker and author Dr. S.M. Davis developed a unique stand on this philosophy, and his materials have been popular with the homeschool culture since the early 1990s. Proponents of courtship say that it is identified by Biblical principles, rather than particular methods or behavioural practices. These principles have been summarized in Leave Dating Behind: a Road Map to Marriage by Christina Rogers within the acronym CARE:
Commitment to marriage
Accountability 
Rejection of the secular dating philosophy
Establishing physical boundaries (Song of Songs 2:7)

Characteristics of traditional Christian courtship 
 The guardianship responsibility of fathers over single daughters.
 The responsibility of parents to prepare their children for marriage in all respects, and for youths to be prepared in terms of talents, education, vocation and finances prior to seeking a courtship relationship.
 The mentoring role of parents or other suitable ""accountability couples"" in a given courtship.
 Supervision of courtships to mitigate temptations or abuse, whether of a sexual, emotional or financial nature.
 Emphasis of the importance of marriage as an opportunity for Christian service rather than a selfish endeavor.
 Emphasis of the importance of singleness before marriage as a time for greater Christian service in the community, rather than a time to be employed in selfish pursuits.
 Emphasis of the importance of counsel and evaluation by family and friends as a relationship progresses. (Song of Songs 1:4)
 Emphasis of the importance of honesty and getting to know one another as real people in ""normal life"" during courtship (as contrasted with the dating habit of meeting during special events and entertainment while on one's best behavior.)
 The maintenance of sexual purity in accordance with the evangelical counsel of chastity.

Sexuality in Christianity"," Christian courtship is a popular term for a traditional Christian approach to dating and marriage. In most cases, the man is the pursuer, and the woman is the pursued. There are, however, many modern variations on this approach. The term ""courtship"" is distinguished from ""dating"" in that the former has a specific end goal in mind, namely marriage, while the latter is a more general term for a period of time that a couple spends together in order to get to know each other. In the case of courtship, the couple is usually not ""boyfriend and girlfriend,"" as the man is expected to marry the woman he is courtship. However, a couple can be ""boyfriend and girlfriend"" for a time before the man proposes. Courtship has been part of Christian practice since the Middle Ages, but the term ""courtship"" itself does not appear until the 1600s. The term was popularised by the book ""The Courtship"" (1642) by William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle. In the 19th century, the word ""courtship"" became associated with ""romance,"" and in the 20th century, with ""dating."" However, in the 21st century, the word is used more broadly to describe any social activity between a couple, whether or not they are romantically involved. The modern Christian courtship process typically involves the man asking the woman's parents for permission to court their daughter, and the woman's parents may also request a background check on the man. The man and woman will then spend time together, with the man pursuing the woman. If the man and woman decide to marry, they will typically do so within a year of beginning to court. In some Christian traditions, courtship is discouraged, and the term ""dating"" is preferred. In other Christian traditions, courtship is encouraged, and the term ""dating"" is discouraged. In some cases, the term ""courtship"" is used to describe a period of time before the couple becomes ""boyfriend and girlfriend,"" and the term ""dating"" is used to describe a period of time after the couple becomes ""boyfriend and girlfriend."" There are a number of variations on the traditional Christian courtship model. For example, in some cases, the woman may be the pursuer, rather than the man. In other cases, the couple may not seek the approval of the woman's parents before courtship. In still other cases, the couple may not pursue marriage, but may instead pursue a ""courtship relationship"" that is not intended to lead to marriage.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,2908344,0.0911392405063291,0.17894736842105263,0.2421498543817845,0.3894080996884735,3,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0.24158938362741722,0.03351709724329916,0.004556752278376139,0.044226044226044224,4,0,7,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3,1,9,0,1,1
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Blue Hills Reservation"", the article should at least have 250 words","Blue Hills Reservation is a  state park in Norfolk County, Massachusetts. Managed by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation, it covers parts of Milton, Quincy, Braintree, Canton, Randolph, and Dedham. Located approximately ten miles south of downtown Boston, the reservation is one of the largest parcels of undeveloped conservation land within the Greater Boston metropolitan area. The park's varied terrain and scenic views make it a popular destination for hikers from the Boston area.

History
European colonizers sailing the coastline noticed the bluish hue of the mountains, which is caused by the presence of riebeckite, which gave area its modern name. The name of the state of Massachusetts derives from the Massachusett Indian tribe's name of the hill: massa-adchu-es-et. In 1893, the Metropolitan Parks Commission purchased the lands of Blue Hills Reservation as one of the state's first areas dedicated to public recreation.

The practice of First Day Hikes to mark New Year's Day with an outdoor activity began in 1992 at Blue Hills Reservation.  By the 2010s, the idea had spread and such hikes were taking place in state parks nationwide.

Flora and fauna
The ecology of the Blue Hills is diverse and includes marshes, swamps, upland and bottomland forests, meadows, and an Atlantic white cedar bog.  A number of endangered species in Massachusetts, such as the timber rattlesnake and copperhead snake, reside in the reservation. Other flora and fauna include dogwood, lady's slipper, white-tailed deer, coyotes, wild turkey, red fox, and turkey vultures.

Climate 
The reservation experiences a humid continental climate (Köppen: Dfb), typical of most of New England. Summers are short but very warm with mild nights. Winters are short, very snowy, and very cloudy. Precipitation is heavy and very consistent year round.

Points of interest

Observatory
The highest point within the reservation, Great Blue Hill in Milton, is the site of the historic Blue Hill Meteorological Observatory. The observatory was founded in 1885 and is the oldest continuous weather recording station in the United States. Its tower offers views of Boston and the surrounding area. The tower and observatory are among numerous reservation features listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Blue Hills Trailside Museum

The Blue Hills Trailside Museum, which is operated by the Massachusetts Audubon Society, offers indoor and outdoor animal exhibits.

Activities and amenities

Blue Hills Reservation is primarily used for hiking and mountain biking. It is also used for snowshoeing, downhill skiing, and cross country skiing during winter, and rock climbing (in certain areas) and horseback riding during permissible months. Between approximately December and March, Great Blue Hill offers a ski area. Houghton's Pond and nearby Ponkapoag Pond are popular swimming and recreation areas during the summer. Other recreational opportunities include non-motorized boating, camping, fishing, picnicking, playing fields, ice skating, interpretive programs, and a children's playground is accessible from the Hillside St entrance to Houghtons pond.

The reservation is managed by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation and is the centerpiece of the Metropolitan Park System of Massachusetts. The Blue Hills are a range of low, rocky hills in the upper Charles River Valley just south of Boston, Massachusetts. The hills are named for the blue-grey color of their rocky slopes, which is a result of the weathering of basaltic bedrock. The Blue Hills are not tall enough to be called mountains, and are in fact only a few hundred feet above sea level at their highest point. The hills are part of a larger geologic formation that includes the recycling of the igneous rock of the Boston Basin, and the soil is mostly made up of glacial till. The Blue Hills Reservation consists of a series of seven drumlins, or hills formed by glaciers during the last ice age. The hills are joined by two glacial spurs, or lateral moraines, that form the borders of the reservation. The Blue Hills Reservation is also home to several kettle ponds, including Tinkers Pond and Spectacle Pond, formed by the glaciers that once covered the region. The Blue Hills Reservation is a popular destination for outdoor recreation. The reservation's many hiking trails, which total over 125 miles (201 km), are used for hiking, walking, and running. Bicycling and horseback riding are also allowed on some trails. The Blue Hills are also a popular destination for rock climbing, with over 1,000 established climbing routes. The reservation's many ponds and lakes are used for swimming, boating, and fishing, and the numerous parks and overlooks are used for passive recreation. In 2009, the Blue Hills Reservation was designated as a National Natural Landmark by the U.S. Department of the Interior.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Sisters of the Infant Jesus"", the article should at least have 250 words","The Sisters of the Infant Jesus, also known as the Congregation of the Holy Infant Jesus or the Dames of Saint-Maur, is a Roman Catholic religious institute, dedicated to education and the training of underprivileged schoolchildren. They were founded in Rouen, France, in 1666, as part of the work of Nicolas Barré, a Minim friar and Catholic priest (1621-1686), who had gathered some young women for the free instruction of the poor in 1662.

Today, the Infant Jesus Sisters and their lay volunteers have a presence worldwide through social projects and schools. They are also known as Dames of St.-Maur, from the address of their major house in Paris.

The foundation of Barré's schools and of the Sisters suggested to St. John Baptist de La Salle the idea of accomplishing a similar work for boys, resulting in his founding of the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools.

History

Origins

In 1659 Barré, who was a respected scholar within his Order, was sent to the monastery of the Order in Rouen. He became widely known as a preacher and his sermons attracted a large audience. In 1662 Barré saw the need for the education of the poor in France.

France in the late 17th century was suffering from the effects of the Franco-Spanish War (1635–1659) and a terrible plague. As a result of his efforts to promote a planned parish mission in the nearby village of Sotteville-lès-Rouen, Barré came to see the suffering of the local population. To enable parents to attend the mission, Barré asked two young women to come and help with the children. One was a local resident, Françoise Duval, 18 years old, the other was Marguerite Lestocq, then aged 20, who, like him, was from Amiens and with whom he had family connections.

He saw the need to make basic education more accessible to all. There were hardly any schools for girls and very few for boys. Most primary school teachers were poorly educated and religious education was almost non-existent; there was profound ignorance of the Catholic faith. In 1662, half the children in Rouen died of famine. Many were homeless and wandered the streets as beggars and, for some, prostitution became one of the few means of livelihood available.

They began to give daily classes to young girls in a room which they were allowed to use, spending that year in this work. Soon three other young women joined them, and two separate schools were opened. Barré would visit the classes frequently, guiding the young women in how to teach and deal with both the children and their parents, drawing upon his own rigorous education under the Jesuits and his experience as a professor. He taught them the value of “instruction and education” and from the beginning he trained the young teachers to respect the uniqueness of each child and to develop each one’s potential. The teachers were to speak in a humble, gentle and simple manner so that even the youngest could understand, and they were to teach only what they themselves had adequately grasped.

As the enrollment increased, more schools were established, and four years later, the ladies in charge of these schools began to live in a community under a Superior. This was the beginning of a religious congregation whose main work was the education of the poor.

The year 1666 saw the founding of the Congregation of the Sisters of the Infant Jesus. After several years of teaching in the schools, the five young women were invited by Barré to consider becoming part of a committed community. After some reflection, they felt that they were indeed called to this way of life and agreed. These women were not bound by religious vows or confined to a cloister. They were free to serve the local community and provide free education for poor children. They committed themselves to this in a legal document drawn up in 1669, becoming called the Charitable Teachers of the Infant Jesus (). As part of their living in trust in God, it was established that the material needs of the schools were to be handled by women outside the new community.

Expansion and division
Due to his declining health, in 1675 Barré was sent to the Minim monastery in Paris. Though limited in his activities, he promoted new foundations of his ""charitable schools of Providence"", starting with two, Saint Jean en Grèves and Saint Nicolas des Champs, training teachers, both men and women for them. He urged his teachers not to wait until pupils arrived at the school; they were to seek out especially those who might be at risk. He also set up trade schools so that girls could earn a living. Again, the education offered was to be entirely free and any profit derived from the pupils’ work was to go to them.

In 1677 Barré began to send teachers to other locations in France, starting with his native Picardy, reaching as far as New France in North America. These women were not part of a religious institute, and so were free to serve their local communities as needed, without the barriers that status would have imposed at that time.

Around that time, he acquired a house located on the Rue Saint Maur in the 6th arrondissement of Paris (now called the Rue de l'Abbé Grégoire), which was to become the motherhouse of the Institute. In 1677 a convent was established in Rue Saint Maur, Paris (ii) and the Sisters were subsequently known as the ""Dames of St. Maur"". In 1678, Barré founded a novitiate for the sisters on the Seine.

The Daughters of Providence were members of a Catholic religious congregation for women founded in 1643, by a pious widow, Marie Polaillon (née de Lumague) under a Rule of Life drawn up by Vincent de Paul. The Daughters would profess annual vows of obedience, chastity, service and stability. In 1681 several houses of the congregation merged with the Sisters of the Congregation of the Holy Infant Jesus, becoming the Sisters of St. Maur and of Providence. A number of ‘Little Charitable Schools’ were established throughout France. In 1683 Mother Françoise Duval, one of the foundresses, was sent to open a school in Lisieux. At the time of Barré's death in 1686, there were over 100 schools being operated by the Sisters of the Holy Infant Jesus throughout France.

Throughout his life, Barré had refused to allow the schools to accept benefices as a means of support, determined to place his trust in God alone, and was followed in this commitment by the teachers of the Institute. Upon his death, however, the lay trustees in Paris and Rouen, who were in charge of the finances of the schools and the teachers who staffed them, strongly disagreed over whether or not to continue this practice.

This was eventually referred to the royal court, and, in 1691, King Louis XIV divided the Institute into three independent groups, with motherhouses in Rouen, Paris and Lisieux. 
The Sisters in the original communities became known as the Sisters of Providence of Rouen and in 1921 became a congregation of diocesan right, under the authority of the local bishops where they served, with a missionary outreach in Madagascar and Central Africa.
The group based in Lisieux also became a diocesan congregation.
The Sisters of St Maur in Paris became an institute of pontifical right with communities in five continents.

Current era
The French Revolution closed all the schools of the institute and it was not until 1805 a new community of teachers was formed by seven surviving members. Less than twenty-five years after the opening of the motherhouse in Paris, eighty schools for free education and forty boarding schools had been established in France. With the granting of official approval from Rome, the Sisters extended their work to America, England, Spain, Malaysia, Japan and Thailand. The new growth of the Institute was such that, by the mid-19th century, schools were opened in Spain and Asia. 'Sisters of the Holy Infant Jesus (Dames of Saint Maur) were among the pioneer missionaries in British Malaya, Japan and Thailand. In 1887, after over 200 years of service without the taking of religious vows, this congregation of Sisters became a religious institute of pontifical right, able to operate independently worldwide.

Southeast Asia
In 1849 a Catholic missionary in the Straits Settlements, Reverend Father Jean-Marie Beurel, a native of Saint-Brieuc in France, suggested to the colonial governor, William John Butterworth, that it might be worthwhile to found a charitable organisation for girls next to the Church in Victoria Street. In August 1852, Beurel bought the house at the corner of Victoria Street and Bras Basah Road. Beurel then appealed to the Superior General of the congregation in France for Sisters to run a school.

Malaysia
Four Sisters were sent to the East. After a long and perilous voyage, one had died at sea, three of them landed at Penang in April 1852. That same year, the three Sisters established a convent that contained an orphanage and school in Penang. In September 1852, the Congregation sent four Sisters to Penang, with Mother Mathilde Raclot in charge, to guide and support the group of sisters who had arrived earlier. The school, Convent Light Street (Malay: SMK Convent Lebuh Light), is Penang's oldest girls' school and has occupied its current site along Light Street near historic George Town for over 150 years. While on the peninsula, the Sisters continued establishing schools with help from the local community such as Kuala Lumpur's oldest girls' school Convent Bukit Nanas and the only Chinese convent girls school Convent Datuk Keramat in Penang. In 1952, St Bernadette's convent school was built in Pusing Road, Batu Gajah Perak with land donated and funds raised from communities. During World War II, the Japanese invaded Malaya and either took over or closed down many such mission schools, notably the iconic Convent Primary School in the hills of Tanah Rata. The Tanah Rata convent is one of the few in the region which still contains an operating school and a church. Today, CHIJ schools can be found in most states and many major cities and they continue to educate local girls of all races and religions.

Singapore

In February 1854, three Sisters led by Rev. Mother Mathilde Raclot arrived in Singapore from Penang and set up the convent in Singapore at Victoria Street. Soon they also started a Convent Orphanage and a Home for Abandoned Babies as they found day-old babies were being left at their doorstep.

To raise funds for their work, Mother Mathilde taught needlework to her fellow nuns and their students, and they sold their products to the wives of the local Chinese merchants. The school became well-known and within ten years, the enrollment had increased to 300. Secondary education began in 1905. Under Mother Hombeline, the expansion programme continued.

The convent occupied a full street block bordered by Bras Basah Road, Stamford Road, Victoria St and North Bridge Road. The iconic church was deconsecrated during the 1980s. Part of the Sisters' quarters has been demolished and converted into SMRT Corporation offices. Most of the original buildings were redeveloped as part of the Heritage Board's preservation scheme. The complex has since been redeveloped into a high-end retail complex called CHIJmes while the church is now a popular attraction for tourists and those interested in history.

The eleven CHIJ schools in Singapore can trace their history to the Victoria Street convent. Satellite schools were founded before and after World War II. The ""original"" convent school is the present-day CHIJ Secondary and CHIJ Primary schools in Toa Payoh. CHIJ Saint Nicholas Girls' School (CHIJ SNGS) was co-located on the same site and functioned as the Chinese section while CHIJ Secondary and Primary were English-medium. After the abolition of vernacular schools, CHIJ SNGS was granted SAP status. All three schools moved out of the Victoria Street complex during the 1980s into larger and more spacious facilities.

East Asia

Japan
In 1872, Mother Mathilde led the first group of French nuns to Japan and founded the Saint Maur International School in Yokohama, where they teach and cared for the disadvantaged Japanese women and children. Mother Mathilde Raclot died, aged 97, in 1911 whilst still in Yokohama, Japan, and buried there.

Europe
The shortage of English teachers forced the Sisters to turn to the British Isles in hopes of recruiting and training potential missionary teachers. In 1909, Mother St Beatrice Foley, who had returned from Singapore, established Drishane Convent in Ireland. It had a ""knitting school"" for younger girls and was also used to train teachers for the Asian mission. Less than half a decade after opening, the convent was churning out teachers and Sisters and sending them to Asia and South America.

South America
The Sisters first set foot in South America during the 1960s. Some of the Spanish-speaking Sisters arrived in Peru in 1967 and have since expanded to several other countries in the continent.

Motto
The motto is Simple dans ma vertu, Forte dans mon devoir, which is often translated into ""Simple in Virtue, Steadfast in Duty"", is featured on the badges of IJ schools worldwide. Depending on the individual school and country, the motto may be in either English or French, or in the native language the school is located in.

Religious organizations established in the 1660s"," Sisters of the Infant Jesus The Sisters of the Infant Jesus (SIJ) is a Catholic congregation of nuns, founded in France in 1822 by Saint Pauline Marie Jaricot. The congregation's members are called Infantines. They are dedicated to the Christ Child and strive to live in the spirit of the infant Jesus, making themselves ""instruments of the love of Christ the Infant"" in their ministry to the church and the world. The congregation was founded in Lyon, France, on Christmas day in 1822, by Saint Pauline Marie Jaricot, who was inspired by the spirituality of Francis de Sales. The institute was established in response to the anti-clericalism and rationalism of the times, in order to revive the faith and strengthen the Church. The sisters' first ministry was the education of poor girls. Today, they also minister to the needs of the elderly, the infirm, and the neglected, in the spirit of Christ, ""the friend of the friendless"". In 1824, the congregation was formally established and recognized by the Church. The sisters' first house of congregation was in Lyons. From there, the congregation expanded to Paris and then to the rest of France. In 1839, the sisters were called to England, where they established a house in Manchester. In 1840, they went to Portugal and opened a house in Lisbon. The Sisters of the Infant Jesus have been called ""the most significant women's congregation to be founded in the early nineteenth century"". As of 2015, the congregation consisted of about 3,000 sisters, serving in over 80 countries. The Sisters of the Infant Jesus have been awarded the Templeton Prize for the Progress of Religion, the highest honor for a living person or group in the field of religion.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,12114116,0.0779746835443038,0.12631578947368421,0.22520518930368016,0.20093457943925233,16,13,0,0,13,1,1,0,0,1,0.15723703021097926,0.02970558644643235,0.038801436067384704,0.0343980343980344,15,1,22,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,27,1,47,1,1,1

Reception 

Samantha Allemann for ArtsHub Australia, rated A Fool Who'll as five-out-of-five stars and explained, ""[it] succeeds in putting together nine songs which are interestingly diverse, yet all equally strong. There's no filler, and that is something quite rare indeed. Laura Jean's gorgeous voice and strong range is well matched by her band and their new electric approach, resulting in an album that's both dynamic and sweet.""

The Sydney Morning Heralds Bernard Zuel noticed that Jean, ""does not fear intimacy"", as the album is, ""dominated by the mix of emotion that comes with falling in love."" She shows, ""The thrill of love is definitely there... but so is its travelling partner in any love affair: the fear of losing that love.""

Melbourne's radio station 3RRR's staff listed it as their Album of the Week on 29 August 2011, with the summary, ""[it] offers the understated but captivating style of previous recordings, and imbues its songs with elements of disquiet, and dissonance... [it] reflects an evolution in [her] sound and approach. Incorporating new sounds.""

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Navy Special Action Regiment"", the article should at least have 250 words","The Navy Special Action Rgiment (RASM) in Arabic: الفوج العمل الخاص للبحرية also known as ""Commandos Marine"", or ""مغاوير البحرية"" in Arabic, is a special forces regiment belonging to the Algerian naval forces.

History 
The Special Action Regiment of the Navy is a special forces regiment of the Algerian naval forces.

It was in 2005 that the first promotion of commandos was born, they were directly affiliated to the Régiments de Fusiliers Marins (RFM) as a detachment of fighter commandos (DCC).

The first promotions also benefited from a commando course at the EFCIP in Boghar.

There were 4 commando sections within the marine fusiliers regiments (RFM).

However, it was decided to gather all the commando and combat diver sections in order to create a new special operations regiment for the Algerian Navy.

In addition, the RASM took over the combat divers of the former special intervention group (GIS) shortly after the latter was disbanded in 2015.

Missions 

The mission of the RASM is :

 Special reconnaissance
 Land combat actions from the sea or on the coast
 Hostage rescue and extraction of persons at sea or on the coast
 Destruction and sabotage of strategic targets
 Interventions at sea in the framework of the State's action at sea (fight against terrorism, maritime piracy, illicit trafficking and maritime offences...)
 The liberation of hostages on boats or ships and the resolution of serious crises at sea

Organization 

The RASM has several companies with various specialties:

 A headquarters
 Assault company which is specialized in sea assaults and maritime counterterrorism
 Hostage rescue company which is specialized in counterterrorism and hostage rescue
 Reconnaissance and support company, which is specialized in reconnaissance and intelligence acquisition, but also in remote neutralization and support to units engaged in combat zones (snipers...)
 Combat diver company, which is specialized in underwater action and maritime counterterrorism actions, and in hostage rescue, and is made up exclusively of combat swimmers.
 Patrol company, which is specialized in maritime patrol and search.

Each company includes a group specialized in hostage rescue on maritime or land targets, which are hostage rescue groups.

However, divers are divided into 2 parts, there are the combat divers, and the clearance divers.

 Combat divers: Combat divers have offensive missions. These divers are in charge of placing mines, assaulting port, coastal and ship targets, hostage rescue and participation in the first phases of the amphibious assault, and they can also perform intelligence.
 Mine clearance divers: the missions assigned to mine clearance divers are the search for and identification of mines, their neutralization, destruction and removal of explosive devices placed underwater or on board vessels.

Training and coaching 
The marine commandos are directly recruited within the marine rifle regiments, to become a marine commando it is mandatory to be a marine rifleman to participate in the selections.

Future commandos are trained at the Ecole d'application des troupes de marine (EATM) in Jijel.

Firstly, the marine riflemen who want to join the marine commandos have to pass a one-week selection phase at the EATM. At the end of the selection phase, if the candidate is selected, he will continue his studies with a commando training course, and will start the marine commando training at the school.

The duration of their training is 4 months, the training is based on three axes:

 Improving physical performance
 Shooting
 The fight

Apart from this training, the focus is on diving, which consists of carrying out Maritime Commandos Operations (MCO), the objective is to be able to carry out attacks on coastal targets.

In addition, marine commandos also take part in training abroad, in particular in the United States with the US Navy Seals, US Marines, Spanish FGNE, Tunisian marine commandos among others.

Equipment and armament

Armament 
The marine commandos are always in double equipment during their actions (automatic pistol + assault rifle), however according to the speciality and the mission the weapons can change, for example the divers do not have the same armament as the assault units...

Association football forwards"," George Dearnaley (11 February 1917 – 30 January 2013) was an English first-class cricketer who made his only appearance for Durham County Cricket Club in 1937, and then joined the Royal Air Force, serving as a pilot during the Second World War. Dearnaley was born in South Shields, Durham, England, the son of George Dearnaley senior (1886–1960), a shipyard draughtsman, and his wife, Annie Elizabeth (née Carr), who had married in 1910. He was educated at Jarrow Grammar School, then a secondary modern school in the town of Jarrow, in Tyne and Wear, and at South Shields High School, a grammar school in the town of South Shields. A right-arm fast bowler and right-handed batsman, Dearnaley made his first-class debut for Durham in the 1937 County Championship against Yorkshire at Bramall Lane in Sheffield. He took two wickets in Yorkshire's first innings of 252, and these were the only wickets of the match, as the match was abandoned without a ball being bowled in Durham's second innings. Dearnaley's two wickets were those of the Yorkshire openers, Percy Holmes and Frank Greenwood, both of whom were caught by William Henderson, the former England Test match wicket-keeper, who was Dearnaley's captain. Dearnaley had two brothers, one of whom, Gordon Dearnaley (1912–1999), also played first-class cricket for Durham, as well as Minor Counties cricket for Durham, and List A cricket for them, too. After a single first-class appearance, Dearnaley joined the Royal Air Force, where he served as a fighter pilot during the Second World War. He served with No. 19 Squadron, based at Duxford, Cambridgeshire, in April 1944, flying a Supermarine Spitfire. Dearnaley died at South Shields in January 2013, at the age of 95.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,40812563,0.06751054852320673,0.08421052631578947,0.16359250433912864,0.19470404984423675,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0.11927832019502793,0.0396356786354499,0.004556752278376139,0.019656019656019656,5,1,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,5,1,9,1,1,1
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Jean Pellissier (shepherd)"", the article should at least have 250 words","Jean Pellissier was a shepherd in the Comté de Foix in the early fourteenth century, made notable by appearing in Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie's Montaillou.  Pellissier was born in Montaillou to a family of poor peasants.  One of a number of sons he became a shepherd as the family land would not enough to sustain all of them.  At the age of twelve, as was the custom, he began tending his family's flock of sheep.  Soon he was apprenticed in Tournon to a woman named Thomassia, likely a widow.  He worked there for five or six years before returning home and living with his widowed mother and his four brothers Raymond, Guillaume, Bernard, and Pierre.

Some years later he again left home to become a shepherd in Niort.  Staying there two years he went to Mompret for a year before again returning to Montaillou.  This time he moved in with Bernard and Guillemette Maurs and worked tending their flock, the couple's children being too young for the job.  His brother Bernard was also residing there working as a ploughboy for the couple.  The Maurs were Cathars and Jean was briefly converted to the heresy.

In 1308, however, the town of Montaillou was raided by the local inquisition and the Maurs arrested.  Jean left for the neighbouring town of Prades d'Aillon where he was hired by Bernard Malet, two months later Bernard was also imprisoned by the inquisition.  Jean remained in the employ of Malet's sons Bernard, Raymond, and André.

Eventually Pellissier left to resume travelling through the region for several years before accumulating enough money to settle in Montaillou with his own flock.

Shepherds"," Jean Pellissier (shepherd) Jean Pellissier (between 1736 and 1738 – 8 June 1808) was a French Catholic priest and blessed who was born in the Dauphiné region of France, the son of a farmer and a shepherdess. He became a shepherd like his mother, and also a lay brother at the Monastic Order of the Discalced Carmelites in Grenoble. After his mother's death, he became a monk at the order's monastery in Avignon. He was sent to Rome in 1768 to attend the beatification ceremony of his fellow monk, Raphael of San Francisco, and was elected Superior of the order's monastery in Florence. After the monastery was closed as a result of the French Revolution, he returned to his native country in 1790 and became the Superior of the monastery at Lyons, which was also closed in 1792. He then went to live in a small house in the province of Vivarais, where he dedicated his life to God and to the poor and underprivileged. He became known for his spiritual wisdom and his ability to heal the sick. In 1804, he was arrested by the French police and accused of being a member of the opposition to the regime of Napoleon Bonaparte. He was found guilty and sentenced to death by firing squad. He was shot on June 8, 1808, and was proclaimed a blessed by the Catholic Church in 1864.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,1271970,0.1181434599156118,0.07368421052631578,0.20360074132909717,0.11526479750778816,0,1,1,0,3,1,0,0,0,1,0.1290373730871552,0.02887303816409692,0.0006904170118751726,0.0171990171990172,5,0,0,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3,1,6,1,1,1

1993 elections in Australia"," Results of the 1993 Western Australian state election (Legislative Assembly) The results of the 1993 Western Australian state election are the most recent where a sitting Premier, David Hassell, has lost his seat. The election was fought on the issue of the proposed goods and services tax (GST), with the incumbent Labor government proposing to introduce a state GST to replace the existing sales tax. The opposition Liberal Party opposed the GST, and won the election on a promise to repeal it if elected. At the time of the election, the Labor government was led by Premier David Hassell, and had been in government since the previous election in 1986. The Liberal opposition was led by Opposition Leader Bill Hassell (no relation to the Premier), and had been in opposition since the last election. At the election, the Labor government was defeated by the Liberal opposition, who won 52 of the state's 75 seats in the Legislative Assembly. The Labor Party won just 33 seats, a loss of 17 seats.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Post Traumatic Slave Syndrome"", the article should at least have 250 words","Post Traumatic Slave Syndrome: America's Legacy of Enduring Injury and Healing is a 2005 theoretical work by Joy DeGruy Leary. 
The book argues that the experience of slavery in the United States and the continued discrimination and oppression endured by African Americans creates intergenerational psychological trauma, leading to a psychological and behavioral syndrome common among present-day African Americans, manifesting as a lack of self-esteem, persistent feelings of anger, and internalized racist beliefs. The book was first published by Uptone Press in Milwaukie, Oregon in 2005, with a later re-release by the author in 2017.

Post Traumatic Slave Syndrome
Expanding on a hypothesis of ""post-traumatic slavery syndrome"" by psychiatrist Alvin Francis Poussaint and journalist Amy L. Alexander, DeGruy wrote in her 2001 doctoral thesis that African Americans ""sustained traumatic injury as a direct result of slavery and continue to be injured by traumas caused by the larger society's policies of inequality, racism, and oppression."" This is summed up in Post Traumatic Slave Syndrome as:

In the book, DeGruy argues that PTSS is a result of unresolved post-traumatic stress disorder arising from the experience of slavery, transmitted across generations down to the present day, along with the stress of contemporary racial prejudice (e.g. via racial microaggressions). This manifests as a psychological, spiritual, emotional, and behavioral syndrome that results in a lack of self-esteem, persistent feelings of anger, and internalized racist beliefs.

DeGruy states that PTSS is not a disorder that can simply be treated and remedied clinically but rather requires profound social change in individuals, as well as in institutions, that continue to reify inequality and injustice toward the descendants of enslaved Africans.

The theory has been generative of subsequent academic work in clinical psychology and black studies.

Reception
In addition to forming the basis of public lectures and workshops offered by DeGruy and her contemporaries, the research described in Post Traumatic Slave Syndrome inspired an eponymous play, which was staged at the Henry Street Settlement Experimental Theater, New York, in 2001.

Critical scholars say that the PTSS hypothesis pathologizes African Americans and is itself racist.

The term was coined in the mid-1990s by African American psychologist and professor, Dr. Joy DeGruy. PTSS is not an official diagnosis listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, but the symptoms of the disorder are similar to those of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The main difference between the two disorders is that PTSD is experienced by individuals who have suffered a traumatic event, while PTSS is experienced by individuals who have suffered repeated exposure to traumatic events. The symptoms of PTSS include depression, anxiety, nightmares, flashbacks, and hypervigilance. These symptoms can be triggered by events that remind the individual of their trauma, such as seeing a police officer or hearing a racial slur. PTSS is believed to be highly underdiagnosed, as many African Americans who suffer from the disorder may not seek help due to fear of discrimination, racism, or lack of access to mental health resources. However, it is estimated that up to 40% of African Americans may be affected by PTSS. Treatment for PTSS typically involves psychotherapy and medication. Psychotherapy can help individuals with PTSS process their trauma and learn how to cope with their symptoms. Medication can be used to treat any co-occurring mental health disorders, such as depression or anxiety, and to help manage PTSS symptoms. PTSS is a complex and deeply rooted disorder, and recovery can be a long and difficult process. However, with proper treatment and support, individuals with PTSS can improve their symptoms and lead healthy and fulfilling lives.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,33046074,0.02531645569620253,0.10526315789473684,0.1514958962139264,0.18847352024922118,1,4,0,0,2,1,1,0,0,0,0.2639929025754422,0.025473939594071182,0.004971002485501243,0.018427518427518427,2,1,5,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,1,9,1,1,1
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""United Kingdom Standard Industrial Classification of Economic Activities"", the article should at least have 250 words","The United Kingdom Standard Industrial Classification of Economic Activities, or UKSIC, is a Standard Industrial Classification that is intended to help classify businesses according to the type of their economic activity. One or more SIC codes can be attributed to a business. SIC codes identify what a business does.

Over time there have been several different SIC systems used in the UK, with versions published in 1958, 1968, 1980, 1992, 1997, 2003 and 2007. These taxonomies have been adapted to cope with the changes in UK industry, The 1980 system was far more detailed in manufacturing, while the 2007 system is much stronger in the IT sector. Many companies still use the 2003 codes which were the 1992 system updated slightly. However, the very latest version is the 2007 SIC system

History
A Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) was first introduced into the United Kingdom in 1948 for use in classifying business establishments and other statistical units by the type of economic activity in which they are engaged. The classification provides a framework for the collection, tabulation, presentation and analysis of data and its use promotes uniformity. In addition, it can be used for administration purposes and by non-government bodies as a convenient way of classifying industrial activities into a common structure.

Current 2007 SIC codes
These now fall in line with the European Union industrial classification system, NACE, and the United Nations International Standard Industrial Classifications, ISIC, to and including the 4 digit class level. For certain classes in the UK SIC 2007 taxonomy a further breakdown to a 5 digit level is available. They have been revised mostly to cater for the greater importance of service activities over the last fifteen years, due to developments in technology, such as information technology and  information and communications technology.

Industry classifications

de:Standard Industrial Classification
es:Código SIC"," The United Kingdom Standard Industrial Classification of Economic Activities, or UKSIC, is a system for classifying industries by business activity. The UKSIC was developed by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and is used by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) to categorise business establishments and other standard units, and is used by government departments and agencies for the collection, analysis, and publication of statistics. The UKSIC is a revision of the International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC), and was developed by the UK to replace the ISIC with a classification more suited to the UK economy. It was first used for the 1981 Census of Production, but was also used for the 1981 Census of Population and Housing, to provide an industrial classification for establishments in the Census. The UKSIC was then used for the 1991 Census, and has been used for all Censuses since. The UKSIC is derived from the ISIC, and has the same basic structure of ten sections, each divided into divisions, each divided into groups, each divided into classes. The UKSIC has twenty-one divisions, seventy-one groups, and 180 classes. The UKSIC is the basis for the Business Structure Database (BSD), which is used to produce the Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS), which in turn is used to produce the Business Activity Index (BAI), the longest series of business activity measures covering the UK economy. The UKSIC has also been used to produce a classification of regions in the UK, the Regional Industrial Classification (RIC), which is used to produce regional economic data. In 2004, the UKSIC was replaced by the International Standard Industrial Classification of Economic Activities (ISIC) rev.4, but the ONS has continued to use the UKSIC for the convenience of users, and because the change to ISIC rev.4 caused breaks in some series. The UKSIC has therefore been retained for backward compatibility, and will continue to be used by the ONS for the foreseeable future. The UKSIC is used to classify units by business activity, but there are some units that are not classifiable, and these units are placed in the ""Not Classifiable"" class (value 9999). The UKSIC is a ten-digit code, and is hierarchical, with the rightmost digit having the lowest importance: 1. Activity 2. Sub-activity 3. Group 4. Class The first two digits give the section, the next two the division, the next two the group, and the last two the class. For example, 21.3.3.1 is the code for Oil and gas extraction, and 21.3.3.9 is the code for Support activities for oil and gas extraction. The UKSIC has ten sections, as follows: 01-09 Oil and gas extraction 09-16 Manufacturing 16-32 Construction 32-33 Wholesale and retail trade, except motor vehicles and motorcycles 33-40 Motor vehicle and motorcycle wholesale and retail 40-45 Business services 45-50 Financial services 50-53 Insurance services 53-59 Other financial services 59-60 Real estate, renting and business activities 60-62 Professional services 62-63 Health services 63-69 Education services 69-72 Social services 72-73 Personal services 73-76 Other services 76-99 Not classifiable The main changes from the ISIC are: The ""agriculture"" section has been collapsed into ""oil and gas extraction"", as the UK has a negligible amount of arable land. The ""fishing"" section has been collapsed into ""manufacturing"", as the UK has a negligible amount of coastline. ""Fur farming"" is collapsed into ""manufacturing"". ""Salt extraction"" is collapsed into ""manufacturing"". The ""textile, leather, and clothing industries"" are collapsed into ""manufacturing"". The ""wood and wood products"" section is collapsed into ""construction"". The ""metal products"" section is collapsed into ""manufacturing"".

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""The Vels"", the article should at least have 250 words","The Vels was an American new wave and synth-pop band formed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1980. The band consisted of vocalist Alice Cohen (as Alice Desoto), keyboardist Chris Larkin and bassist Charles Hanson.

Career
The Vels began when Charles Hanson, former member of the 1970s New Orleans punk group, the Normals, invited Chris Larkin and Alice Desoto to join him for a show at the now defunct Love Club in Philadelphia. The band used low tech synthesizers, drum machines, and bass guitar. The Philadelphia Inquirer music critic, Lee Paris was there, and wrote a positive review. The Vels were a prominent fixture on the Philadelphia music scene of the early 1980s. They caught the attention of Mercury Records and signed a recording contract with them.

The Vels' debut studio album, Velocity (1984) was recorded at Compass Point Studios in Nassau, Bahamas with producer Steven Stanley, known for his work with Tom Tom Club. Chris Larkin had left sometime before their second studio album, House of Miracles (1986) and it was recorded without him, this time with production by Steve Levine, known for his work with Culture Club.

A music video for their song ""Look My Way"" was filmed in London, and became popular during the early days of MTV.

In 1986, the Vels toured the U.S. as the opening act for British band the Psychedelic Furs, but disbanded in 1987.

Keyboardist and singer, Chris Larkin, died from complications due to pneumonia, on November 21, 2007.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Riverhead, Kent"", the article should at least have 250 words","Riverhead is a northern village part of the urban area of Sevenoaks in the district of the same name in Kent, England and is also a civil parish.  The parish had a population in 2001 of 1821, increasing to 2,634 at the 2011 Census.

The parish stretches from Chipstead Lake and the River Darent in the north through the hamlet of Dibden and A21 to Mill Bank Wood in the south.

History
The origin of the name of the village may lie in the Saxon word 'rither' meaning hill or
deriving from the word meaning 'cattle landing place'.
Riverhead was an early settlement, part of the Codsheath Hundred.
The settlement grew in size during Saxon times as traffic on the pilgrim routes between
Canterbury and Winchester increased.  
The prosperity of the village during Georgian times is indicated by the high proportion
of households that had to pay Hearth Tax on their properties, and although the village
was of modest size, it was surrounded by several major country estates such as
Chipstead Place, Bradbourne and Montreal.

Riverhead had a variety of country industries typical of the area, including a tannery, a
timber yard, smithies and the posting house. The economy was based mainly on
agriculture, along with some gravel and sand quarrying to the north east of the village
that created the lakes around Bradbourne which are now a wildfowl reserve.

The village has a central conservation area that covers some  and contains about 30 listed
buildings.  The listed properties in the Conservation Area date from the 17th and 18th Century
and the older unlisted properties date mainly from the 19th Century.

The 1831-built C of E church is dedicated to St Mary the Virgin; its architect was Decimus Burton.  It is in the late Georgian lancet style, executed in characteristic local materials. The 1882 extension by Arthur William Blomfield shows how Victorian church design developed.  The east window was installed in 1905 by Charles Eamer Kempe.

Today
Every year there is the Village Fete and Carnival on the little common, surrounded by residential roads in the west of the village, held by the 3rd Sevenoaks scout group.

There is one pub in Riverhead, The Bullfinch (McMullen & Sons).  The village has a butchers on The Square, Batchelors, a small, family-run business, providing its own spicy sausage from a South African recipe called 'Boerewors'.

Shops on the White Hart Parade and London Road include a couple of boutiques, a small art gallery, restaurants (such as a Malaysian restaurant, called Longhouse), a dry cleaners, barber, and hairdressers. The parade gets its name from a pub that was once there.  The village Library offers telecottage services and is open on specific week days.  On London Road, along with a coffee shop and boutique, there is also a power-tools, car and machinery hiring shop.

In the north of the village is Tesco and a range of other shops such as Bathstore, a tile store and Majestic Wine.  There is also an Aston Martin dealership.  The Barratt Lakeside Place estate, built on the former Marley Tiles site in the mid-1990s, sits pleasantly on the banks of Chipstead Lake.

Digital television has been available for aerials pointing east in Riverhead since 2006 from the Blue Bell Hill Transmitter for Kent & Sussex TV transmissions, which is also now broadcasting in HD.

Education and sport
Riverhead contains Amherst Primary School and Riverhead Infants School. On Saturdays, there is Saturday morning football club at the former school, open to the students there. There is a nursery on the former site of Riverhead Infants School until 2002 with the rest of the site now being residential. Holmesdale Cricket Club play in Riverhead at the top of Worship's Hill.

Behind the church is an area known as the sand pits which is popular amongst the young people in Riverhead.  The area adjoins a steep sandstone cliff.

The Riverhead parkland is part of the former Montreal Park (the remaining part is an estate of houses) and offers walks and children's recreation areas traversing the Wealden Greensand vale of the Darent Valley between Riverhead Infants School and Brittains Lane, Sevenoaks.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Niram Maratha Pookal"", the article should at least have 250 words","Niram Maratha Pookal () is a 1979 Indian Tamil-language film directed and co-written by Bharathiraja. It stars Sudhakar, Raadhika, Vijayan and Rati. The film was released on 31 August 1979.

Plot 
Sudhakar is a poor man desperately looking for work. One day he has a skirmish with Radhika, a rich woman and only daughter of a businessman Selladurai, in a telephone booth. Radhika finds out that Sudhakar is searching for a job from his diary that he leaves at the booth. She employs him in her father's firm as a manager and soon they mutually fall in love. Radhika's class-conscious father initially opposes but later reluctantly agrees to have them married. However things take a turn when his business friend Sivaraman, to whom he owes a lot of favours, visits him and reminds him of his old promise to get Radhika married to Sivaraman's son Vijayan. And soon after Sudhakar goes missing with five lakhs of the office cash on his way to Bombay and is presumed to have absconded. Radhika is heart-broken and her father takes her to Sivaraman's estate in Ooty to relax for a while.

In Ooty, Radhika and her father are introduced to Vijayan who shockingly seems to be a severely despondent alcoholic. He is often seen standing near the shore of the river listening to his tape recorder playing a lone melodious song, sung by a woman. After a few days in the estate and several interactions, Vijayan and  Radhika get acquainted and friendly with each other and he opens up about his erstwhile lover Rathi. Vijayan had fallen in love with the beautiful Rathi at first sight and pursues her relentlessly till she finally reciprocates. Rathi often playfully cheats Vijayan about not knowing stuff like horse riding and car driving when she actually could. And on an April Fool's Day when she claims she doesn't know how to swim, Vijayan thinks she's fooling him again and playfully pushes her into the river but to his horror she drowns and dies. The incident left Vijayan as a suicidal wreck who carries poison in his coat but doesn't consume it just for his father's sake. Rather he has chosen the slow poison of alcohol. When Vijayan learns Radhika too has a past forlorn love affair, he feels closer to her since they both seem to be in the same boat.

As days move on, Vijayan and Radhika get closer to each other and eventually agree to get married, much to the delight of their fathers but then on an eventful day Radhika encounters Sudhakar working as a gardener in the estate. Radhika angrily admonishes him for having deserted her and walks away but Vijayan is determined to find out the truth. It turns out that Sudhakar was coerced and forced to decamp by Radhika's father himself so he could get her married to Vijayan.  On the day of their supposed marriage, Vijayan gets Radhika united with Sudhakar and they leave town together. Later, Vijayan who had promised to Radhika to give up alcohol, instead consumes the poison he carried in his pocket and walks into the river that had once consumed his beloved Rathi. Before dying Vijayan makes a statement to God, ""They say love is blind, but You have been blind to my love, so I am leaving my glasses for You"".

Production 
After Panchu Arunachalam wrote the screenplay for the film that would become Niram Maratha Pookal, Bharathiraja approached K. Bhagyaraj for advice; Bhagyaraj rewrote the screenplay. When Panchu learned of this, after reading Bhagyaraj's rewritten version, he recommended that it be made into a film. Bharathiraja initially wanted Rajinikanth, Kamal Haasan and Sridevi to portray the characters Vijayan, Sudhakar and Rati; the producer who initially was supposed to produce died, so Sudhakar, Raadhika, Vijayan and Rati Agnihotri were instead cast as the lead characters, with their characters being named after themselves. Ravi, who later debuted with Bharathiraja's Nizhalgal (1980) was asked to audition as a dubbing artist for Vijayan. However, since Bharathiraaja himself decided to dub for the character, Ravi was dropped.

Soundtrack 
The music was composed by Ilaiyaraaja.

Release and reception 
Niram Maratha Pookal was released on 31 August 1979. Kaushikan of Kalki negatively reviewed the film, calling it worth watching only for Sudhakar and Raadhika.

While at the hotel, Jaishankar's friend Prem Anand (his friend) arrives and tells him about a Marwadi woman, Niram Marwadi, who is looking for a husband. Jaishankar, for a lark, goes to meet her and finds that she is the same woman who was his neighbour in his childhood. He finds that her husband, who was a Marwadi, had died, and she has returned from the United States to look for a new husband. Jaishankar decides to marry her, and she accepts. During the wedding, Niram's brother suddenly arrives and objects to the marriage. He says that his sister is already married, and her husband is a Marwadi. Jaishankar is confused, and asks how this can be, since the man she was married to in the past was a Tamil. Niram's brother reveals that after her marriage, her husband had died in an accident. However, the couple had already purchased a house, and the deed to the house was in the husband's name. The brother wants to sell the house to a builder, but the deeds have been lost.

To make matters worse, the brother threatens to kill Jaishankar if he does not marry Niram. Later, the brother is found dead in his room, and it is implied that he was killed by Niram. The police suspect Jaishankar, since he was the last person to see the brother alive. Jaishankar tells Rajarajan that he is innocent, and the real murderer is Niram. He says that he knows this because he had intercepted a letter that was written by Niram to her brother. However, the police find that the letter is actually a blank sheet of paper. It is revealed that Niram's brother was killed by a man named Rappoport, who had come to collect money that was owed to him. Rappoport was accidentally killed by Niram, who was hiding in the house at the time. To cover up the murder, Niram framed her brother's death as an accident. However, since the deed to the house was in his name, she needed to find a Marwadi to marry so that she could claim ownership of the house. The police arrive at the house where Rappoport was killed, and find a man named therein. He says that he had come to visit his sister, Niram, and was shocked to find that she had been murdered.

Bonnie goes to Luka (Bryton James) to apologize for channeling him and to return his talisman. Luka forgives her and agrees to help her unbind the spell from the moonstone. They set up everything they need and start chanting while the moonstone elevates and explodes in the air. Bonnie looks happy that they managed to break the moonstone and the spell.

Tyler and Caroline are in the Lockwood cellar where Tyler installs new chains in the floor and walls to chain himself and Caroline mixes a wolfsbane cocktail for him. He chains himself up and tries to drink the cocktail while Caroline stays there to support him. As time passes, Tyler feels the pain and screams and asks Caroline to leave so he will not hurt her. Caroline tries to stay with him as much as she can but when the transformation begins, Tyler cannot control himself and she runs out of the cellar closing the door behind her so Tyler cannot get out. She runs into the woods and goes back to the cellar later to check up on Tyler. Tyler is back in his human form and Caroline gets back into the cellar to help him.

Back at the Gilbert house, Jenna (Sara Canning) searches some files that Elena's mom was saving about the history of Mystic Falls, because she wants to help a ""writer"" who is working on a book. Elena seems fine with it and offers to help but she is terrified when she sees that the ""writer"" is Elijah (Daniel Gillies) and he is in the house. Elijah thanks Jenna for her help and pretends to leave. Elena runs to Jeremy's room to talk to him but Elijah stops her saying that he wants to talk to her.

Elijah and Elena get in her room and he lets her know that he doesn't want to break the curse and that he also does not intend to hurt her or anyone she loves. He says that Klaus has become paranoid over the years and he just wants to find where he is so he can kill him. Elijah wants to use Elena as bait to draw Klaus out and he makes a deal with Elena: she is to stop trying to kill herself and he will keep her family safe in return. Elena agrees but wants one more favor from him.

Luka returns to his home where Jonas (Randy J. Goodwin) is waiting for him. Jonas asks if he was successful and Luka responds in the affirmative and gives him the moonstone that he and Bonnie supposedly destroyed. Luka does not seem really fine that he had to fool Bonnie and after he gives the moonstone to Jonas he turns to leave. Jonas stops him telling him that Elijah wants them to do one more thing for him.

Damon is back at the Salvatore house where he finds Rose (Lauren Cohan) waiting for him. She apologizes for fleeing Slater's apartment when Elijah appeared and while they are talking they hear a noise of glass breaking. A werewolf breaks into the house and tries to attack Damon but Rose gets into the way and the werewolf bites her instead. Damon stabs the wolf with a sword and the injured wolf escapes. Damon checks up on Rose and they see that the bite starts healing. They are both relieved that the myth about the werewolf bite being fatal for vampires was not true.

Meanwhile, Stefan (Paul Wesley) is still stuck in the tomb with Katherine who tries to seduce him by invading his mind. Stefan wakes up and tells her to stay out of his head. They start talking with Stefan asking her to apologize for all the things she did but Katherine does not apologize. She tells him that she loves him and to prove it she tells him that Isobel, Elena's birth mother, can help him find Klaus. Their conversation is interrupted by Elijah who comes to the tomb to free Stefan. Elijah explains that he made a deal with Elena which she will explain to him and he is now free to exit the tomb since Elijah had the spell lifted. Stefan gets out of the tomb and Katherine tries to follow him but Elijah blocks her way and compels her to stay in there unless he tells her otherwise. He wants to make sure that Klaus will know exactly where she is when he comes to town. Katherine begs Stefan to not leave her in there but Stefan walks away to go find Elena and the two of them make up and are back together.

The episode ends with Damon apologizing to Rose for picking a fight with a werewolf that led to her getting bitten. Rose is just relieved that the myth was not real and the two of them agree to stay friends with benefits. They start to kiss but Rose feels pain on her shoulder, where the werewolf bit her. They check on her shoulder and they see that the area is not exactly healed and they look at each other with fear and confusion in their eyes.

Reviews
""By the Light of the Moon"" received positive reviews.

Emma Fraser from TV Over Mind gave an A rating to the episode saying that it was chock-full of story and emotion. ""This was the night that focused on the wolf mythology which allowed this story to shine, really terrific work from all those involved. The Elena thread has moved along nicely and whilst seeing her rebel from those protecting her is an interesting angle it will be welcome to see her being less impulsive in her attempts at protection. With a new problem with the unknown effect of a wolf bite the next episode should be a treat.""

Diana Steenbergen from IGN rated the episode with 8.5/10 saying that the episode was a typically overstuffed one, full of plot developments and intriguing character pairings. ""As a mid-season finale, the ending was something of a letdown, especially for a show that thrives on shocking its audience in the last few minutes of so many episodes. But with several weeks before the next new Vampire Diaries, maybe it is for the best that we are not left with a more riveting cliffhanger.""

Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic rated the episode with 3.9/5 saying that it was not exactly the most action-packed episode and an overall letdown since this was the mid-season finale episode. However, Richenthal praised Michael Trevino and those who were involved in Tyler's transformation scene: ""Full props, however, must be given to Michael Trevino, and, really, everyone involved in that transformation scene. It was intense and agonizing to watch... in the best possible way.""

Robin Franson Pruter of Forced Viewing rated the episode with 3/4 saying that the werewolf transformation elevated a disjointed episode. ""The strength of the transition sequence in this episode elevates it above the average. However, the episode would have been stronger had it been more unified and cohesive and had it tried to cover less ground.""

Shannon Vestal from Buzzsugar gave a good review to the episode saying that it was entertaining but she also feels like it was a bit of a letdown. ""As much as I love this show, it deserves a big come on this week. After a week of titillating previews of Stefan and Katherine mauling each other, it all turns out to be just a dream. What a letdown.""

Meg of Two Cents TV also gave a good review saying that this was a great episode. ""I thought this episode did a good job of moving the story forward past [...] We’re moving forward on the road to Klaus and the werewolf storyline just keeps getting more interesting.""

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""American Advertising Museum"", the article should at least have 250 words","The American Advertising Museum was a museum in downtown Portland, Oregon, United States. Founded in 1986, the museum displayed advertising from the 18th century to the present day. The museum featured both permanent and traveling exhibits on advertising campaigns, industry icons, and advertising in general. There was also a library and gift shop before it closed by the end of 2004.

History
Mick Scott with Leonard W. Lanfranco's assistance, opened the museum in 1986. Homer P. Groening, Matt Groening's father, was also one of the founding directors of the museum. It opened on June 26 of that year in the Erickson Saloon building and was initiated by the Portland Advertising Federation. At the time it was the only museum in the world devoted solely to advertising. For a time from 1995 to 1996 the museum was located on the city's Eastside.

In 1996, the museum moved to a location in Portland's Old Town Chinatown neighborhood. The PBS show Antiques Roadshow featured the museum in a 1999 episode. In 2000, the William F. Eisner Museum of Advertising & Design museum opened in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and the AAM was no longer the only museum to focus exclusively on advertising. The AAM relocated to Portland's Chinatown district in 2001. In 2003, the HMH ad agency won an ADDY award for their design for the museum's stationery.

By February 2004 the Eisner Museum had acquired the American Advertising Museum collections as an exchange for paying its debts, and the AAM was closed. However, the Eisner Museum in turn closed in 2010, when the building it was located in was sold.  , the disposition of the museum's collection and archives is unknown.

Features
The American Advertising Museum had a library, a rare books collection, manuscripts from national advertising campaigns, and a gallery of prints of historic ads. Their exhibits included displays on icons from the advertising world, ""Aunt Jemima Meets Mr. Peanut"", and displays from a permanent collection featuring advertising from as early as the 18th century. Additionally, it had one of the six original Jantzen Diving Girls once featured at places such as Jantzen Beach Amusement Park and Portland's PGE Park. Last located on NW Fifth Avenue, the museum contained a gift shop featuring advertising themed merchandise.

Exhibits included displays on Coca-Cola, political campaigning, Cream of Wheat ads, a homage to bad advertisements, and women in advertisements among others.

Districts of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands
Minority Concentrated Districts in India"," Nicobar district is one of the three districts of the Indian union territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The district is carved out from the territory's previous North and Middle Andaman districts. It comprises two groups of islands: the Great Nicobar Islands and the Little Nicobar Islands. The district has its headquarters at Car Nicobar. The Nicobar Islands are located in the eastern Indian Ocean, to the south of the Indian mainland. They are isolated by the 150-kilometre-wide Ten Degree Channel, which is a dividing line between the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea. To the north of the islands is the Andaman Sea.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""History of Rockland County, New York (1798–1900)"", the article should at least have 250 words","The recorded history of Rockland County, New York begins on February 23, 1798, when the county was split off from Orange County, New York and formed as its own administrative division of the state of New York. It is located  north-northwest of New York City, and is part of the New York Metropolitan Area.  The county seat is the hamlet of New City. The name comes from rocky land, an early description of the area given by settlers. Rockland is New York's southernmost county west of the Hudson River.  It is suburban in nature, with a considerable amount of scenic designated parkland. Rockland County does not border any of the New York City boroughs, but is only  north of Manhattan at the counties' (New York and Rockland) two respective closest points (Palisades, New York, in Rockland and Inwood Park in Manhattan)

Most of the early settlers were Dutch, with a sprinkling of Huguenot and Quaker families. The settlers lived almost entirely off the land, farming – berries, fruits and vegetables, as well as hunting, fishing, and trapping.

Early attempts to settle the county by the Dutch were generally unsuccessful, and in 1664 they handed over the territory to the English. Yet the Dutch did leave a legacy in place names like Dunderberg Mountain, Sparkill and High Tor, as well as a small collection of unique sandstone houses like the 1700 DeWint House, built in Tappan and still exists, which later served as George Washington’s headquarters.

During the American Revolutionary War, Rockland County was a strategic crossroads, camping ground and vital link between the northern and southern colonies. Troops often used Kings Ferry at Stony Point and Dobbs Ferry at Snedens Landing in Palisades. The first post office in Rockland County was established at New Antrim, now Suffern, on October 4, 1797.

By 1800, the total population of the newly created County of Rockland was nearly 6,400.  The land was cleared, homes, schools and churches were built and sawmills and gristmills erected along the numerous creeks.

By 1828, Native Americans had virtually disappeared from the county and slavery existed in a diminished form.

History

The area that became Rockland County was originally inhabited by Algonquian-speaking Native Americans, including Munsees, or Lenni Lenape.  The Tappan tribe had a particularly noteworthy presence in the area, extending from present-day Nyack, south to Sparkill and Tappan, down the Hackensack River valley through present-day Bergen County, NJ, and also along the Palisades and Hudson shore all the way down to present-day Edgewater, NJ.

In 1609, Henry Hudson was the first major Dutch explorer to arrive in the area.  Hudson, thinking he had found the legendary ""Northwest Passage"", sailed on the Half Moon up the river that would one day bear his name, and anchored near the area that is now Haverstraw before continuing north of what is now Albany.
 
In the years before 1664 when the area was formally a Dutch colony called New Netherland, present-day Rockland did not have formal European settlements.  However, individuals did explore the area and made transactions with Tappan tribe for land with the idea that it could have future use.  For example, in 1640, Dutch Captain David Pietersz. de Vries purchased from natives the area where the Sparkill Creek flows into the Hudson River.

In 1664, the British Crown assumed control of New Netherland from the Dutch.  In June of 1664, the Berkeley-Carteret land grant established the colony of New Jersey, dividing present-day Rockland and Bergen Counties into separate political areas.  The northern border of New Jersey was placed in a straight line from the Delaware River at present-day Port Jervis to the Hudson River at 41 degrees even North latitude, where the Palisades Cliffs pause and give way to Sneden's Landing in Orangetown.  The state line remains there to this day, though various disagreements along the exact border were had over the years.

In the 1670s, permanent Dutch settlers began to arrive with land grants, starting with the Tappan area. These settlers were eager to escape ""city life"", moving from Manhattan to Rockland.   A number of unique, Dutch-style red sandstone houses still stand, and many place names in the county reveal their Dutch origin.

In 1683, when the Duke of York (who became King James II of England) established the first 12 counties of New York, present-day Rockland County was part of Orange County, known then as ""Orange County South of the Mountains"". Orangetown was created at the same time under a royal grant, originally encompassing all of modern Rockland County. Around this time, as the English began to colonize Nyack and Tappan, the Native Americans began to leave Rockland in search of undisturbed land further north.

The natural barrier of the Ramapo Mountains and the size of the county made carrying out governmental activities difficult. At one point, two governments were active, one on each side of the Ramapo Mountains, so Rockland split off from Orange in 1798 to form its own county. That same year, the county seat was transferred from Tappan to New City, where a new courthouse was built.

Haverstraw was separated from Orangetown in 1719, and became a town in 1788; it included the present-day Clarkstown, Ramapo, and Stony Point. Clarkstown and Ramapo became towns in 1791, followed by Stony Point in 1865.

During the American Revolution, when control of the Hudson River was viewed by the British as strategic to dominating the American territories, Rockland had skirmishes at Haverstraw, Nyack, and Piermont, and significant military engagements at the Battle of Stony Point, where General ""Mad"" Anthony Wayne earned his nickname. George Washington had headquarters for a time at John Suffern's tavern, the later site of the village of Suffern. British Major John André met with American traitor Benedict Arnold near Stony Point to buy the plans for the fortifications at West Point. André was captured with the plans in Tarrytown on his way back to the British lines; he was brought to Tappan for trial in the Tappan church, found guilty, hanged, and buried nearby. Still another important chapter in the story of the Revolution was written on May 5, 1783, when General Washington received Sir Guy Carleton at the DeWint House, where they discussed terms of a peace treaty. Two days later, Washington visited Sir Guy aboard a British war vessel. On this day, the king's navy fired its first salute to the flag of the United States of America.

In the decades following the Revolution, Rockland became popular for its stone and bricks. Many buildings in New York City were built with bricks made in Rockland.  These products, however, required quarrying in land that many later believed should be set aside as a preserve. Many unsuccessful efforts were made to turn much of the Hudson Highlands on the northern tip of the county into a forest preserve. Union Pacific Railroad president E. H. Harriman, though, donated land and large sums of money for the purchase of properties in the area of Bear Mountain. Bear Mountain/Harriman State Park became a reality in 1910 when Harriman's widow donated his lands to the state, and by 1914, more than an estimated one million people a year were coming to the park. After World War I, Rockland County became the most important sausage-making hub in New York.

Rockland remained semirural until the 1950s, when the Palisades Interstate Parkway, Tappan Zee Bridge, and other major arteries were built. In the decades that followed, the county became a maturely developed suburb of New York City.  As people moved up from the five boroughs (particularly the Bronx in the early years) the population flourished from 89,276 in 1950 to 338,329 in 2020. A 379% Increase.

Historical settlements
In the 19th century, the following settlements were created in these towns. Several have been renamed, some expanded and others disappeared.
The naming of settlements mostly derived from the person who owned the land, the geography of the location.  Currently Rockland County is one of 24 areas in New York State designated a Preserve America Community.

The Clarksville Witch 1816
Jane  (Naut) Kannif, the widow of a Scotch physician, lived in a small house on Germonds Road in West Nyack. She devoted herself to the care of her only child, a son by a previous marriage, named Tobias Lowrie. She treated, with great results, neighbors that came to her with herbs and methods she learned from her late husband. But ""Naut Kannif"", as she was called, seemed to have been exceedingly eccentric. According to the people at that time she dressed oddly, had strange hairdos and was unsociable. She was regarded as insane – worse yet – a witch in an era of superstition. It was decided to take ""Naut"" to Auert Polhemus's grist mill and using his great flour scales weigh her against the old Holland Dutch family Bible, iron bound, with wooden covers and iron chain to carry it by. If outweighed by the Bible, she must be a witch beyond any doubt, and must suffer accordingly. She was taken to the mill against her most earnest protest, put on the scales, and weighed. Weighing more than the Bible, the committee released her. This was the last witch trial in the state of New York.

Hangings in Rockland County
There are three recorded hangings in Rockland County. They all took place in the 18th century.
 Claudius Smith – (1736 – January 22, 1779) was a notorious Loyalist guerrilla leader during the American Revolution.
 British Major John André – (May 2, 1750 – October 2, 1780) was a British army officer hanged as a spy during the American Revolutionary War.
 Isaac Jones, 24 years old was hanged on Oct 5, 1792 for a bar room brawl killing.

Early industries
The earliest of its industries was the growing of foodstuffs for the great city. Iona Island, known as Weyant's Island  became famous with the noted Iona grape as well as hundreds of fruit trees and vines.

Besides agriculture, boat building was one of the early industries until after the American Civil War.  Johnsontown in Haverstraw was the seat of the first boat building. Nanuet ran a Lumber business. The mountain people in Ladentown made baskets, beer barrel hoops, bowls, chairs, ladles and spoons they made from the wood and reeds found in the mountain to sell or take to New York City to be sold.

Mills, both saw and grist, were among the first industries of the county.  As early as 1792, tanneries were in existence. Theill's Corners, named after a Dane who came to the locality previous to the Revolution erected a forge. Water power of the Minisceongo was used for grinding grist in 1793;
A 120-foot dam was constructed across the Ramapo River. By 1813, The Ramapo Works, owned by the Pierson brothers were producing a million pounds of nails annually.  The addition of a cotton mill in 1814, and later woolen mills, nearly doubled the size of the Works, which in 1822 were incorporated under the name ""Ramapo Manufacturing Company."" During its heyday, the Pierson nail factory was a powerful economic stimulus to the region because of its links to existing agricultural and commercial trade. Ramapo developed into an agricultural marketplace and a locale for manufacturing innovations.  Garnerville was the home of the John Suffern Paper Mill in 1850, and print cotton textile factories. West Haverstraw, once known as Samsondale, was where a large rolling mill was started in 1830;

Ramapo built its early reputation in the iron industry.  Iron mining was opened up by an English company in 1768 and in 1771 a nickel mine.  Because of the proximity of iron mines, numerous metal products were made – plows, hoes, railings, nails, machinery, even cannonballs. The Ramapo Wheel and Foundry Company, organized in 1873, took the prize among all competitors for the productions of their wheels at the Vienna Exposition of 1873.

Grey and red sandstones were quarried in great quantities, Building stone from local quarries went into the old Capitol at Albany, Fort Lafayette and the old Trinity Church in New York destroyed in the Great Fire of New York (1776), and the first building at Rutgers College.  In 1838 Calvin Tomkins and his brother Daniel purchased approximately  of land, located in a cove north of the Stony Point promontory, limestone was found in usable quantities suitable for burning along the river shore for the purpose of making lime.

Rockland factories made shoes, straw hats, silk and cotton cloth, sulfur matches, smoking pipes and pianos. But the greatest of the industries was the making of brick followed by the ice harvesting.

The first bricks, made for public market, were baked in 1810 on the banks of the Minisceongo, but not until James Wood, of England, set up a brick kiln at Haverstraw, in 1817, was the first successful plant erected.  Wood developed the modern way of mixing coal dust with the clay, in 1828, which revolutionized the manufacture of brick. Commonly referred to as ""Bricktown"", Haverstraw was famous for its brick-making, which was a major industry for the village. Brick-making was so popular due to the clay formed by the Hudson River's water and the rich soil that lined Haverstraw's waterfront, that it was nicknamed the ""Brickmaking Capital of the World"". Many of the old brownstone and brick structures that were constructed in New York City in the late 1890s-early 1900s were composed of bricks manufactured by Haverstraw. At one point, in the early 20th century, there were more than 40 brick-making factories lining the Hudson River within the village. Although brick-making involved all the ethnic groups, 60 percent of the brickyard workers were African-Americans.

Rockland Lake, a beautiful sheet of water a half mile back from the Hudson, at an elevation of more the 150 feet above that river was and is the most notable natural lake and  the source of one of the largest branches of the Hackensack River.
Rockland Lake, known to have had the cleanest and purest ice in the area was harvested by The Knickerbocker Ice Company established 1831. The company harvested thousands of tons of ice from the lake each year and once harvested 1 million tons of ice. The wooden storehouse's walls were insulated with sawdust to keep the ice blocks frozen until they were shipped in the summer. By 1834, the company owned a dozen steamboats, 75 ice barges and employed about 3,000 to ship ice countrywide. The stored ice was placed on inclined railroad cars, transported down the mountainside, placed on barges on the Hudson River and shipped to New York City. Slaughter's Landing was used as the shipping point for the Ice harvested at Rockland Lake. So much ice was shipped that Rockland Lake became known as the ""Icehouse of New York City"".

Early Sports

Transportation during the earlier years

Stagecoach

Roads were primitive and transporting products from the western end of the county to the Hudson River was very difficult. After legislative approval, it took 17 years to complete the Nyack Turnpike, a cross-country carriage road which connected Nyack to Suffern. The stagecoach which crossed the Ramapo Pass, was heavily traveled in winter when the Hudson River froze over to travel between Albany, New York and New York City.

Historic steamboats
With the lack of roads, travel was largely confined to sloops, which made regular trips up and down the river. Steamboats were built to travel up and down the Hudson, carrying both passengers and freight. Steamboats provided much of the transportation to New York City.  Steamboat navigation in Rockland started with a local steam vessel named the ""Orange"" referred by some as ""Pot-Cheese"" in reference to her beauty and others “The Flying Dutchman"" because of her speed. She provided regular schedule between Nyack and New York. The North River Steamboat or North River (often erroneously referred to as Clermont) is widely regarded as the world's first commercially successful steamboat. It was not until twenty years later that a boat was used that could be depended on to make a round trip in one day attracting competition from steamboats later built at Haverstraw and Tappan. To facilitate steamboat traffic from Tappan Landing, a road was built over the marshes to the end of a 500-foot pier, which within a few years became the terminus of the New York & Erie Railroad. The construction of this road was an invaluable aid in the development of the county. It caused the building of Piermont with its lone pier which made possible the founding of a half dozen villages and opened the way to the utilization of the mineral and agricultural resources of Rockland. Other railroads followed. The first steamer bringing passengers to the railroad for the historic trip from Piermont to Ramapo was named ""South American"" and the steamer ""Utica"" brought passengers from New York City on the opening of the Erie railroad to Goshen, New York.

Hudson River Day liners included PS Alexander Hamilton, PS Chauncey Vibbard, PS Washington Irving

Prominent Hudson River steamboats included Chancellor Livingston (1816), James Kent (1823), DeWitt Clinton (1828), Robert L. Stevens (1835), Rip Van Winkle (1845), Isaac Newton (1846), Daniel Drew (1860), Thomas Cornell (1863), Chauncey Vibbard (1864), Dean Richmond(1864), Charles W. Morse (1904), Hendrick Hudson (1906), Robert Fulton (1909) constructed or engines built by Allaire Iron Works, Cornelius H. DeLamater, Harlan and Hollingsworth, Jonh Stevens, W. & A. Fletcher Company, West Point Foundry.

Historic railroads
In 1833, a charter was given to the New York and Erie Railroad, which had trains running in the county by 1840.
New York and Erie Railroad was completed in 1851 becoming the longest railroad in the US  stretching 483 miles from Piermont to Dunkirk on Lake Erie and the second-longest railroad in the world. The President of the United States, Millard Fillmore, 13th President of the United States and the Secretary of State, Daniel Webster, along with a score of national and state officials, boarded the train at the Piermont Pier for the first trip. Back in the 19th century railroads, freight and passenger lines, were instrumental for the development, growth and prosperity of Rockland County. Many of the hamlets and villages were built near the Depots. Most of the Post Offices were built near the stations. Passengers traveling to New York City would board steamers at Piermont. The first five locomotives were ""Eleazar Lord"", ""Piermont"", """"Rockland"", ""Orange"" and ""Ramapo"" respectively.

Rockland County places of interest

Rockland County's rocks

 Indian Rock – This 17,300-ton Proterozoic granite gneiss is .8–1.2 billion years old. Originating between the Ramapo Mountains and Hudson Highlands, this glacial erratic was deposited in Montebello by the Laurentide Ice Sheet approximately 21,000 years ago.
 Maria's Rock – Front lawn of Pfizer/Wyeth – (Lederle Laboratories), North Middletown Road in Pearl River – An 18th-century legend tells of a little girl named Maria who wandered from her home in nearby Tappan and died of hunger and exposure. Tradition says that villagers found her bones near the massive boulder.
 Spook Rock is the largest of the cluster of rocks located on Spook Rock Road and Highview Avenue in Airmont. The Tappan and Warawankogs of the Lenni-Lenape Wolf Tribes, an Algonquian people, worshipped the sun, moon, stars, and a spirit called Manitou. Story has it that a Dutch farmer's daughter was sacrificed at this site and her ghost appears on the anniversary of her death.

The Dunderberg Spiral Railway
A pleasure railroad partially constructed in 1890–1891 and never finished. The first part of the ride would have taken the cars up two inclined planes to the summit  above the Hudson River, where visitors could disembark to enjoy the scenery. Then the cars would have coasted by gravity down a nine-mile (14 km) scenic railway, making two spirals and three switchbacks. It would have been to this day the biggest roller coaster ever constructed.

Piermont hand-cranked drawbridge
The Piermont hand-cranked drawbridge was originally built in 1880 by The King Iron Bridge Company, a Cleveland company in the state of Ohio that constructed more than 10,000 bridges over six decades. The hand-cranked drawbridge is used as a pedestrian walkway providing a link to Tallman Mountain State Park.  This bridge is the only hand-cranked drawbridge in Rockland County and perhaps in the United States.  Back in the day, fishermen on sloops heading up and down the creek got out of their vessel, cranked up the drawbridge, sailed across, got out of their vessel and cranked down the drawbridge for vehicular traffic. The whole bridge was dismantled piece by piece, sent off-site for restoration and restored to its original state after a complete forensic analysis. Allan King Sloan, the great-great-grandson of the company's founder, provided some of the information that is on the historical marker nearby and attended the dedication ceremony on August 7, 2009.

zh:羅克蘭縣 (紐約州)"," History of Rockland County, New York (1798–1900) The county was created on January 15, 1798, by the New York State Legislature, after the Revolutionary War and the defeat of British Commander John Burgoyne at Saratoga. It was named in honor of theStack Rocks, a phenomenon of five erratic stacks rising from the Hudson River near its western boundary with New Jersey, in the area of Doodletown. The stacks are a major feature of the county seal. Rockland's early history is closely tied to the geography and history of the Hudson River. The river was the main transportation artery in the region, and Rockland's location along it gave the county its initial importance. The area that now includes Rockland was first inhabited by the Lenape natives, who lived in the region for thousands of years. In 1609, the Dutch voyager Henry Hudson explored the river and settled in the area. He and his crew traded with the local natives, and the river became known as the North River, as it flows north from the Atlantic Ocean to its source. In 1664, the English took control of the region. It was then that the Dutch name for the river, Noort Rivier, was anglicized to the Hudson River. The city of New York was founded as New Amsterdam at the southern tip of Manhattan in 1625, and grew to be an important colonial port. In the 18th century, the region that now includes Rockland was the western portion of Orange County. It included the towns of Newburgh, Wallkill, and Goshen. Rockland became its own county in 1798, when it was split from Orange. During the American Revolution, Rockland was the site of many battles and troop movements. The British military occupied the county for seven years, as they moved troops and supplies between New York City and the northern colonies. The main route of the British army was the King's Highway, which runs through the county from New Jersey to New York. In the 19th century, the opening of the Erie Canal across New York State in 1825 created a major new transportation route that connected the region to the west. As the canal ran through the length of the state, the importance of the Hudson River as an economic artery began to wane.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,30971498,0.1692205196535643,0.16842105263157894,0.3450106600894612,0.34735202492211836,23,25,0,0,24,1,0,0,0,1,0.22876993543938498,0.02431143178080286,0.01436067384700359,0.022113022113022112,65,0,52,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,57,1,75,1,1,1
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Anne Woodrooffe"", the article should at least have 250 words","Anne Woodrooffe (born Anne Cox; 14 July 1766) was a 19th-century British author. She was best known for her 1824 religious novel Shades of Character.

Life
Woodrooffe was born on 14 July 1766. Her father was John Cox of Harwich. She married vicar Nathaniel George Woodrooffe on 27 July 1803. The couple had two children, Emma Martha (b. 30 May 1807) and Thomas Wood (d. 19 December 1865). The 1900 Dictionary of National Biography indicates she died on 24 March 1830, while 1966's Jane Austen and Some Contemporaries indicates her death was in 1850.

The evangelical cleric Daniel Wilson asked Woodrooffe to foster his only daughter, perhaps in 1827 when he was left a widower.

Works
Woodrooffe's first book was a biography, The History of Michael Kemp - the happy farmers lad (1819). She produced a sequel to this volume in 1827, Michael the Married Man. Her primary impact was in the area of moral reform, with her most important book, according to the Dictionary of National Biography, 1824's Shades of Character, which presented a Christian educational system for girls ""designed to promote the formation of the female character"" through the means of a series of dialogues connected by a slight story. In a similar vein, she authored Cottage Dialogues in 1821, a book which depicted rural life for the pleasure and improvement of the lower classes. 1855 saw the publication of her First Prayer in Verse.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Goldman child abduction case"", the article should at least have 250 words","The Goldman child abduction case refers to the 2004–2009 international child abduction of Sean Goldman and the international petition for his repatriation by his father, David Goldman, over the objections of his mother, Bruna Bianchi Carneiro Ribeiro (died 2008), her family, and her new husband (married 2007), João Paulo Lins e Silva.

The child abduction case
The child abduction case evolved around application of Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. Sean Richard Bianchi Carneiro Ribeiro Goldman was born in the year 2000 in the United States, to an American father and Brazilian mother. In 2004, at the age of four years, Sean went to Brazil with his mother for a 2-week vacation. However, his mother refused to return to the United States. The father David Goldman vowed to have his son back and lawsuits and counter-lawsuits ensued both in the United States and in Brazil.

Bruna Bianchi eventually filed for, and was granted, a divorce by a Brazilian court. She then married Brazilian lawyer João Paulo Lins e Silva in 2007, and subsequently died while giving birth to their child in 2008. After Bruna's death, the Brazilian husband obtained a custody order for the child from the Brazilian courts by failing to inform them of Bruna's death and requesting a new Brazilian birth certificate be issued that listed himself as the father under the Brazilian concept of socio-affective paternity, on the basis of which, he refused to return the boy to David Goldman, Sean's father. Based on a decision of Brazil's Supreme Court, Sean was handed over to his father on December 24, 2009. As of January, 2010, his Brazilian family was hoping to regain custody. Sean's grandmother Silvana Bianchi Carneiro Ribeiro has vowed to continue the battle through the Brazilian courts. 
New Jersey courts have denied visitation rights for both grandparents months before the grandfather's death.

International ramifications
The case was focus of international media coverage. It was also subject of deliberations during meetings of high level Brazilian and American officials. US Congress introduced H.R. 2702, legislation to suspend Brazil's Generalized System of Preferences trading benefit. The case was also discussed on the US House of Representatives floor with a statement from Congressman Chris Smith (Republican, New Jersey), a staunch supporter of David Goldman, a New Jersey resident; U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton treated the case as a diplomatic issue of Brazil's obligations under the Hague Convention.

Media coverage
On 30 January 2009, NBC's news program Dateline NBC broadcast a lengthy piece titled ""Fighting for Sean"" on the case and an interview by program's Meredith Vieira with David Goldman, the child's father.
The Dateline piece caught the attention of Congressman Chris Smith (R-New Jersey) who contacted the father and offered help. He wrote a major article in The Washington Times on 19 June 2009 titled ""Will Brazil Do The Right Thing"". 
Goldman was interviewed on many media outlets including in Today a few times, on Dr Phil show on 1 December 2008, on CNN's Larry King Live on 4 March 2009, on CTV's Canada AM and on Fox News Channel's On the Record
There were public comments on the case by US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on 4 March 2009 on NBC's Today show and by Brazilian President Lula on CNN on 23 March 2009.    
On 15 July 2009, David Goldman testified in front of a Congress committee about child abductions. On 16 July 2009, NBC's Today broadcast a one-hour interview with him.
NBC paid for a charter flight for David Goldman and 9-year-old Sean back to the U.S. NBC News correspondent Jeff Rossen, along with other members of his team, was on board the plane. The Society of Professional Journalists condemned NBC News for practicing ""checkbook journalism"" by chartering the jet. Mr. Goldman stated in his book, A Father's Love, that NBC had already chartered the jet to fly its news crew home in time for Christmas Day, and when the courts granted him custody on December 24, NBC offered the ride so that he wouldn't have to risk taking a public flight.
On 8 January 2010, Dateline NBC broadcast a special on the case upon the successful return of the child to his father. The 2-hour special presented by Meredith Vieira was titled ""Bringing Sean Home: The Untold Story"". Parts of the exclusive interview and shots of the father-son reunion were broadcast on NBC's Today on 28 December 2009. Parts of this special were aired in Brazil by Rede Record newsmagazine series Domingo Espetacular presented by Paulo Henrique Amorim, on 17 January 2010.
 The season 20 episode of Law & Order titled ""Brazil"" was inspired by the custody case.
 On April 27, 2012 Dateline aired an exclusive interview with Sean Goldman that was conducted by Meredith Vieira.

Trials regarding custody of children"," Goldman child abduction case The Goldman child abduction case involved the July 2, 1964, kidnapping of eight-year-old Susan Goldman from the front yard of her home in the Hollywood Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles, California. The case was notable for the efforts of her father, Murder Squad detective Harry Goldman, to obtain the return of his daughter. After her return, Susan Goldman was able to identify her kidnapper, and the case was the first of its kind to result in a conviction and a death penalty sentence. Harry Goldman was a veteran of the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), and the father of eight-year-old Susan. On the afternoon of July 2, 1964, Goldman was at work when he received a phone call from his wife, telling him that Susan had gone to the front yard to play and had not returned. He immediately drove home, and found that a neighbor had seen a man carrying a small child to a car, but had not recognized the man or the car. Goldman notified the police, and a search began. The search included a request by Goldman for the assistance of the Press, and the story was covered extensively by the media. The search continued for several days, with the assistance of police dogs, a police helicopter, and the National Guard. Goldman and his wife held a press conference on July 4, in which they pleaded for the return of their daughter, and stated that they would offer a $5,000 reward for information leading to her return. The couple also appeared on the July 5 episode of the television program This Is Your Life, hosted by Ralph Edwards, to publicize the search for their daughter. In the episode, Goldman and his wife described their life with Susan, and their hopes for her return. On July 14, 1964, the body of a child was found in a shallow grave in the mountains of Malibu, in western Los Angeles County. The body was identified as that of Susan Goldman. The cause of death was determined to be a gunshot wound to the head. In the investigation of the crime, police learned that a man had been seen carrying a child in the neighborhood where Susan lived, and had also been seen acting strangely in the neighborhood a few days earlier. The man was identified as 23-year-old Arnold Munk, a one-time friend of the family who had a history of mental illness. Munk was found to be in possession of Susan's clothes and jewelry, and was identified by Susan's brother as the man he had seen carrying his sister. Munk was charged with the murder, and went to trial in December 1964. At the trial, Goldman took the stand and identified Munk as the man he had seen carrying his daughter. Munk was convicted of the murder, and sentenced to death. In January 1965, Munk was sentenced to death in the gas chamber. In June 1965, Munk was executed in the gas chamber at San Quentin Prison. Goldman died in December 1993. In 1994, the case was the subject of a made-for-television movie, entitled The Other Side of the Screen: The Story of the Goldman Family. The movie was based on a book by Harry Goldman, written in 1985.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,25603498,0.15752461322081573,0.24210526315789474,0.4083487776895242,0.6012461059190031,3,4,1,0,3,1,1,1,0,1,0.29852530738714217,0.030079669635943964,0.008285004142502071,0.02457002457002457,2,3,8,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,1,9,1,1,1

Hippotes, son of Mimas and father of Aeolus, the keeper of the Winds in the Odyssey. He was a mortal king.
Hippotes, a Corinthian prince as the son of King Creon, who accused Medea of the murder she had committed on his sister and his father. His persona was assumed by Medeus, son of Jason or Aegeus and Medea, when he came to the court of King Perses of Colchis.
Hippotes, a son of Phylas by Leipephilene, daughter of Iolaus, and a great-grandnephew of Heracles.  When the Heracleidae, on their invading the Peloponnesus, were encamped near Naupactus, Hippotes killed the seer Carnus, in consequence of which the army of the Heracleidae began to suffer very severely, and Hippotes by the command of an oracle was banished for a period of ten years.

fr:Hippotès"," Hippotes is a genus of ground-dwelling beetles in the family Carabidae. It contains about 20 species distributed in the Palearctic region. They are related to the genus Carabus. The species of Hippotes are distinguished by their small size (4–7 mm), the shape of the body, which is usually elongate-oval, and the wrinkled, punctured, and often pubescent body surface. The head is always punctured in front of the eyes. The pronotum is wider than long, with strongly punctured disk and weakly crenulated lateral margins. The elytra have a distinct pale border along the suture and the marginal interval, and are covered with small, usually round, punctures. The venter is usually more strongly punctured than the elytra. The legs are short and sturdy, with the usual five-segmented tarsi. They occur in a variety of habitats, ranging from dry, warm, low-lying areas to mountainous and cold regions, and from southern Spain to the northern tips of Norway and Russia. The larvae are white, with a slight tinge of yellow, and up to 10 mm long. They live in small burrows which they cover with a thin layer of soil. They are often found in the roots of sedges (Carex) and other aquatic plants. Hippotes are predators and feed on small invertebrates, such as larvae of Diptera. The genus was first described by the French entomologist Louis Joseph Montrouzier in 1855.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,4987363,0.4050632911392405,0.12631578947368421,0.3066807872208984,0.10747663551401869,2,2,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0.14337856272754676,0.025369300295758197,0.002899751449875725,0.030712530712530713,35,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,6,0,1,1
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""San Siro di Struppa"", the article should at least have 250 words","San Siro di Struppa is a Roman Catholic, Romanesque-style church in Struppa, a neighborhood of Genoa, region of Liguria, Italy.

History
A Benedictine abbey was founded here in the Middle Ages, entitled to St. Syrus of Genoa, who, according to the tradition, was born here. A church existed here, most likely, since the 5th century AD, but it is documented only in 955. In 1025 bishop Landulf I of Genoa gave it the Benedictines.

The church was most likely rebuilt in the 12th century, as testified by its Genoese Romanesque style. It received  a series of modifications in the 16th century, in the wake of the new procedures established by the Council of Trent. Baroque elements were added in the 17th century. The Romanesque forms were restored in the 20th century.

Overview
The church was built in sandstone, without external decorative elements aside from the Lombard bands of the upper edges of the walls, present on every side. The central rose window of the façade was restored in the 20th century, replacing the Baroque window. In that occasion were also restored the triple mullioned windows of the bell tower, which has a height of 32 m.

The interior has a nave and two aisles, divided by sturdy columns without decorations. The main piece of art is a polyptych of St. Syrus (1516), once attributed to Teramo Piaggio, now assigned to Pier Francesco Sacchi.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Static light scattering"", the article should at least have 250 words","Static light scattering is a technique in physical chemistry that measures the intensity of the scattered light to obtain the average molecular weight Mw of a macromolecule like a polymer or a protein in solution. Measurement of the scattering intensity at many angles allows calculation of the root mean square radius, also called the radius of gyration Rg. By measuring the scattering intensity for many samples of various concentrations, the second virial coefficient A2, can be calculated.

Static light scattering is also commonly utilized to determine the size of particle suspensions in the sub-μm and supra-μm ranges, via the Lorenz-Mie (see Mie scattering) and Fraunhofer diffraction formalisms, respectively.

For static light scattering experiments, a high-intensity monochromatic light, usually a laser, is launched in a solution containing the macromolecules. One or many detectors are used to measure the scattering intensity at one or many angles. The angular dependence is required to obtain accurate measurements of both molar mass and size for all macromolecules of radius above 1–2% the incident wavelength. Hence simultaneous measurements at several angles relative to the direction of incident light, known as multi-angle light scattering (MALS) or multi-angle laser light scattering (MALLS), is generally regarded as the standard implementation of static light scattering. Additional details on the history and theory of MALS may be found in multi-angle light scattering.

To measure the average molecular weight directly without calibration from the light scattering intensity, the laser intensity, the quantum efficiency of the detector, and the full scattering volume and solid angle of the detector needs to be known. Since this is impractical, all commercial instruments are calibrated using a strong, known scatterer like toluene since the Rayleigh ratio of toluene and a few other solvents were measured using an absolute light scattering instrument.

Theory
For a light scattering instrument composed of many detectors placed at various angles, all the detectors need to respond the same way. Usually detectors will have slightly different quantum efficiency, different gains and are looking at different geometrical scattering volumes. In this case a normalization of the detectors is absolutely needed. To normalize the detectors, a measurement of a pure solvent is made first. Then an isotropic scatterer is added to the solvent. Since isotropic scatterers scatter the same intensity at any angle, the detector efficiency and gain can be normalized with this procedure. It is convenient to normalize all the detectors to the 90° angle detector.

where IR(90) is the scattering intensity measured for the Rayleigh scatterer by the 90° angle detector.

The most common equation to measure the weight-average molecular weight, Mw, is the Zimm equation (the right hand side of the Zimm equation is provided incorrectly in some texts, as noted by Hiemenz and Lodge):

where

and

with

and the scattering vector for vertically polarized light is

with n0 the refractive index of the solvent, λ the wavelength of the light source, NA Avogadro's number (6.022x1023), c the solution concentration, and dn/dc the change in refractive index of the solution with change in concentration. The intensity of the analyte measured at an angle is IA(θ). In these equation the subscript A is for analyte (the solution) and T is for the toluene with the Rayleigh ratio of toluene, RT being 1.35x10−5 cm−1 for a HeNe laser. As described above, the radius of gyration, Rg, and the second virial coefficient, A2, are also calculated from this equation. The refractive index increment dn/dc characterizes the change of the refractive index n with the concentration c, and can be measured with a differential refractometer.

A Zimm plot is built from a double extrapolation to zero angle and zero concentration from many angle and many concentration measurements. In the most simple form, the Zimm equation is reduced to:

for measurements made at low angle and infinite dilution since P(0) = 1.

There are typically a number of analyses developed to analyze the scattering of particles in solution to derive the above named physical characteristics of particles. A simple static light scattering experiment entails the average intensity of the sample that is corrected for the scattering of the solvent will yield the Rayleigh ratio, R as a function of the angle or the wave vector q as follows:

Data analyses

Guinier plot
The scattered intensity can be plotted as a function of the angle to give information on the Rg which can simply be calculated using the Guinier approximation as follows:

where ln(ΔR(θ)) = lnP(θ) also known as the form factor with q = 4πn0sin(θ/2)/λ. Hence a plot of the corrected Rayleigh ratio, ΔR(θ) vs sin2(θ/2) or q2 will yield a slope Rg2/3. However, this approximation is only true for qRg < 1. Note that for a Guinier plot, the value of dn/dc and the concentration is not needed.

Kratky plot
The Kratky plot is typically used to analyze the conformation of proteins, but can be used to analyze the random walk model of polymers. A Kratky plot can be made by plotting sin2(θ/2)ΔR(θ) vs sin(θ/2) or q2ΔR(θ) vs q.

Zimm plot
For polymers and polymer complexes which are of a monodisperse nature () as determined by static light scattering, a Zimm plot is a conventional means of deriving the parameters such as Rg, molecular mass Mw and the second virial coefficient A2.

One must note that if the material constant K is not implemented, a Zimm plot will only yield Rg. Hence implementing K will yield the following equation:

Experiments are performed at several angles, which satisfy condition  and at least 4 concentrations. Performing a Zimm analysis on a single concentration is known as a partial Zimm analysis and is only valid for dilute solutions of strong point scatterers. The partial Zimm however, does not yield the second virial coefficient, due to the absence of the variable concentration of the sample. More specifically, the value of the second virial coefficient is either assumed to equal zero or is inputted as a known value in order to perform the partial Zimm analysis.

Multiple scattering
Static light scattering assumes that each detected photon has only been scattered exactly once. Therefore, analysis according to the calculations stated above will only be correct if the sample has been diluted sufficiently to ensure that photons are not scattered multiple times by the sample before being detected. Accurate interpretation becomes exceedingly difficult for systems with non-negligible contributions from multiple scattering. In many commercial instruments where analysis of the scattering signal is automatically performed, the error may never be noticed by the user. Particularly for larger particles and those with high refractive index contrast, this limits the application of standard static light scattering to very low particle concentrations. On the other hand, for soluble macromolecules that exhibit a relatively low refractive index contrast versus the solvent, including most polymers and biomolecules in their respective solvents, multiple scattering is rarely a limiting factor even at concentrations that approach the limits of solubility.

However, as shown by Schaetzel, it is possible to suppress multiple scattering in static light scattering experiments via a cross-correlation approach. The general idea is to isolate singly scattered light and suppress undesired contributions from multiple scattering in a static light scattering experiment. Different implementations of cross-correlation light scattering have been developed and applied. Currently, the most widely used scheme is the so-called 3D-dynamic light scattering method,. The same method can also be used to correct dynamic light scattering data for multiple scattering contributions.

Composition-gradient static light scattering
Samples that change their properties after dilution may not be analyzed via static light scattering in terms of the simple model presented here as the Zimm equation. A more sophisticated analysis known as 'composition-gradient static (or multi-angle) light scattering' (CG-SLS or CG-MALS) is an important class of methods to investigate protein–protein interactions, colligative properties and other macromolecular interactions as it yields, in addition to size and molecular weight, information on the affinity and stoichiometry of molecular complexes formed by one or more associating macromolecular/biomolecular species. In particular, static light scattering from a dilution series may be analyzed to quantify self-association, reversible oligomerization and non-specific attraction or repulsion, while static light scattering from mixtures of species may be analyzed to quantify hetero-association.

Physical chemistry"," Static light scattering In static light scattering, a beam of light is incident on a colloid and the intensity of the scattered light is measured as a function of the angle between the incident light and the scattered light. Typically, the intensity of scattered light is measured at several angles and the results are analyzed to determine the scattering pattern and the structural properties of the colloid. The results of static light scattering experiments are often analyzed using the Rayleigh equation. The Rayleigh equation describes the scattering of a beam of light through a colloid, and is used to determine the size of the colloidal particles. The Rayleigh equation is a result of the assumption that the particles in the colloid are spherical. Static light scattering can also be used to study the thermodynamic behavior of a colloid. The thermodynamic behavior of a colloid can be studied by measuring the scattering intensity at a fixed angle as a function of temperature. The molecular weight of the dispersed phase can be determined from the obtained thermogram. The main advantage of static light scattering is that it is a non-destructive technique that can be used to study a colloid. The dynamic light scattering requires that the particles in the colloid have Brownian motion, which limits the application of dynamic light scattering. However, static light scattering can be used to study the structure of particles that do not have Brownian motion, such as metallic particles. One of the disadvantages of static light scattering is that it requires a large amount of sample to obtain a meaningful result. Additionally, the analysis of the results of a static light scattering experiment is not straightforward, and requires advanced knowledge of the theory of light scattering. Static light scattering can be used to study the structure of a colloid and the thermodynamic behavior of the colloid.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""The Five Sharps"", the article should at least have 250 words","The Five Sharps were an American short-lived vocal group from Queens, New York. They are best known today for their recording of ""Stormy Weather"". ""Stormy Weather""  is today considered one of the most collectible doo-wop singles ever released. According to the Acoustic Music organization, this version of the song ""is one of the rarest of all R&B records. Only three 78rpm and no 45rpm copies are known to exist"".

After the group broke up, several of the members went on to join other groups, such as The Videos.

The recording of ""Stormy Weather""
In 1952, after months of performing at local functions, The Five Sharps were spotted by a producer and taken into a studio to record two songs. The group recorded their own ""Sleepy Cowboy"" and the standard ""Stormy Weather"". The session took most of the day and they were paid in hot dogs and soda pop. 
First tenor Bobby Ward remembers that sales of ""Stormy Weather"" were so bad that he and the other members had to buy their own copies, even though they had never been paid for the recording in the first place. The song was released on Jubilee #5104.

The 78 rpm
In late 1961, record collector Billy Pensabene found a 78 rpm copy of the record and brought it to Times Square Records, run by Irving ""Slim"" Rose. Slim borrowed the record to play on his ""Sink Or Swim With Swingin' Slim"" radio show on WBNX. While in his care, however, the record was broken. Slim admitted in June 1965 that the record ""broke under [his] arm"" on the way home from the studio, but at other times he claimed that his pet raccoon, Teddy, had broken the disc by sitting on it.

Slim assured his angry customer that he would replace the broken record. He put up a sign in his store offering $25 in credit for a 78 of the song and $50 for a 45 rpm single. When weeks went by without any takers on his offer, Slim raised the rewards. Slim then went to the owner of Jubilee Records, Jerry Blaine, to get him to reissue the original. He was told that ""Stormy Weather"" was one of a batch of 80 masters which had been destroyed in a fire.
 
Since Jubilee, in 1952, had been releasing singles on both the 78 and 45 formats, collectors assumed that there must be a 45 somewhere (even then, collectors valued 45s much more than 78s). None ever surfaced, however, and only a handful of 78's of ""Stormy Weather"" have ever been found.

The re-recording
In 1964, as the legend of the song grew, Jubilee hired a new group of musicians, under the name of The Five Sharps. They then recorded a new version of ""Stormy Weather"". It was released as Jubilee 5478, a 45 single. This version is not nearly as collectible as the first version.

After ""Stormy Weather""
Cuffey was diagnosed with leukemia and died in 1960. Bassett joined late-period incarnations of both the Drifters and the Flamingos, and later, formed the 1970s band, Creative Funk. Bobby Ward cut one unsuccessful record titled ""The Key To The City"" in New York in the mid 1960s, but was largely inactive musically. The other members, pianist Tommy Duckett and Mickey Owens, left the music industry until 1975, when four of the surviving group members, including Ward, performed at the Academy of Music in New York.

A sharp object can easily penetrate the thin, fragile skin that covers these organs. This can result in a variety of injuries, from minor lacerations to serious internal bleeding. It can also result in infection, as these organs are often exposed to bacteria in the air or in the surrounding environment. The five sharps are particularly susceptible to injury in certain situations, such as during a fight or when handling sharp objects.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Minor spliceosome"", the article should at least have 250 words","The minor spliceosome is a ribonucleoprotein complex that catalyses the removal (splicing) of an atypical class of spliceosomal introns (U12-type) from eukaryotic messenger RNAs in plants, insects, vertebrates and some fungi (Rhizopus oryzae). This process is called noncanonical splicing, as opposed to U2-dependent canonical splicing. U12-type introns represent less than 1% of all introns in human cells. However they are found in genes performing essential cellular functions.

Early evidence

A notable feature of eukaryotic nuclear pre-mRNA introns is the relatively high level of conservation of the primary sequences of 5' and 3' splice sites over a great range of organisms.

Between 1989 and 1991, several groups reported four independent examples of introns with a splice site that differed from the common intron:

Cartilage matrix protein (CMP/MATN1) gene in humans and chickens
Proliferating cell nucleolar protein P120 (NOL1) gene in humans
Mouse Rep3 gene, presumably involved in DNA repair
Drosophila prospero gene that encodes for a homeobox protein

In 1991 by comparing the intron sequences of P120 and CMP genes, IJ Jackson reported the existence of ATATCC (5') and YYCAC (3') splice sites in these introns. The finding indicated a possible novel splicing mechanism. 
 
In 1994, S.L. Hall and R.A. Padgett compared the primary sequence of all reports on the four genes mentioned above. The results suggested a new type of introns with ATATCCTT 5' splice sites and YCCAC 3' splice sites and an almost invariant TCCTTAAC sequence near the 3' end of the introns (so called 3' upstream element). A search for small nuclear RNA sequences that are complementary to these splice sites suggested U12 snRNA (matches the 3' sequence) and U11 snRNA (matches the 5' sequence) as being putative factors involved in splicing of this new type of introns.   
  
In all these four genes, the pre-mRNA contains other introns whose sequences conform to those of major class introns. Neither the size nor the position of the AT–AC intron within the host gene is conserved.

In 1996, Woan-Yuh Tarn and Joan A. Steitz described an in vitro system that splices a pre-mRNA substrate containing an AT–AC intron derived from the human P120 gene. Psoralen cross-linking confirms the base-pairing interaction predicted by Hall and Padgett between the branch site of the pre-mRNA substrate and U12 RNA. Native gel electrophoresis reveals that U11, U12, and U5 snRNPs assemble onto the P120 pre-mRNA to form splicing complexes.

Structure of U12-type introns 
Although originally referred to as AT-AC introns, not all these introns are delimited by AT-AC dinucleotides. Some of them have GT-AG or AT-AG ends, at least. Thus, it is more correct to speak about the splicing machinery which is used to process them, differentiating between U2-type (canonical or major) and U12-type (non-canonical or minor). The main determinants for distinguishing U2- and U12-type introns are 5' splice site and branch site sequences.

The minor spliceosome consists of U11, U12, U4atac, and U6atac, together with U5 and an unknown number of non-snRNP proteins. The U11, U12 and U4atac/U6atac snRNPs are functional analogs of the U1, U2 and U4/U6 snRNPs in the major spliceosome. Although the minor U4atac and U6atac snRNAs are functional analogs of U4 and U6, respectively, they share only limited sequence homology (c. 40%). Furthermore, the sequence of U11 in comparison with U1, as well as U12 compared with U2, are completely unrelated. Despite this fact, the minor U11, U12, U4atac and U6atac snRNAs can be folded into structures similar to U1, U2, U4 and U6, respectively.

Location of minor spliceosomal activity

The location of spliceosomal activity for the minor class spliceosome is regarded by most experts to be in the nucleus.  However, a single paper has claimed that the minor spliceosome is active in the cytosol.  The data presented within this paper are not fully accepted within the field and directly contradict numerous other papers.

Evolution

Like the major spliceosome, the minor spliceosome had an early origin: several of its characteristic constituents are present in representative organisms from all eukaryotic supergroups for which there is any substantial genome sequence information. In addition, functionally important sequence elements contained within U12-type introns and snRNAs are highly conserved during evolution.

RNA splicing"," Minor spliceosome The minor spliceosome is a group of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) that play a key role in the removal of introns from minor (or alternative) splice variants of pre-mRNA. snRNPs form a complex with the intron-containing pre-mRNA and participate in the splicing reaction. The minor spliceosome is composed of at least three Sm-domain-containing proteins: SnRNP core protein SmD3, SmD2, and SmD1. It also contains two other proteins: SmB and SmE. The minor spliceosome is involved in the removal of introns that are located in positions of intron-exon boundaries that do not match the consensus sequence for splicing (i.e. the 5' end of the intron has a purine nucleotide instead of the usual pyrimidine nucleotide). The resulting minor splice variant of the pre-mRNA will often be translated into a protein that is structurally and/or functionally different from the major splice variant of the pre-mRNA. The minor spliceosome can also be involved in the generation of chimeric RNA molecules. Such RNA molecules contain sequences from two or more different mRNAs. In the case of the minor spliceosome, the chimeric RNA molecules are generated by a trans-splicing reaction, in which the two RNA molecules to be joined have compatible 3' and 5' splice sites. The function of the minor spliceosome can be explained by the following reaction scheme: The minor spliceosome catalyzes the splicing reaction in a similar manner as the major spliceosome. In the first step, the attacking splice site is chosen. In the second step, the bond between the two splice sites is cleaved. Then, in the third step, the intron is released, and in the fourth step, the two exons are ligated. The steps 2 and 3 are the rate-limiting steps in the minor spliceosome-catalyzed splicing reaction. The catalysis of these steps is highly specific and requires the presence of a variety of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs). The snRNAs are similar to the guide RNAs that are involved in the catalytic reaction of the major spliceosome. However, unlike the guide RNAs of the major spliceosome, the snRNAs of the minor spliceosome are not bound to a protein. The structure of the minor spliceosome has not been resolved experimentally. However, based on the conservation of sequence and structure of the Sm proteins, it has been proposed that the minor spliceosome forms a helical structure with the Sm proteins SmD3 and SmD2 forming a core that is surrounded by the Sm protein SmD1 and the snRNAs. In many cases, a particular pre-mRNA can be alternatively spliced to produce both major and minor splice variants. The decision which variant will be produced is often dependent on the cell type or the developmental stage of the cell. In such cases, the minor spliceosome can be in competition with the major spliceosome for the removal of the intron. In some cases, the minor spliceosome is the dominant splicing pathway, whereas in other cases the major spliceosome is the dominant splicing pathway.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,7900132,0.0586275816122585,0.22105263157894736,0.1494224043030531,0.514018691588785,5,7,0,0,3,1,1,1,0,1,0.12815770790258382,0.027596482155044372,0.010770505385252692,0.03931203931203931,11,0,7,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,9,1,18,1,1,1

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Route 40 (MTA Maryland)"", the article should at least have 250 words","Route 40 is a limited stop bus route, identified as a ""QuickBus"", operated by the Maryland Transit Administration in Baltimore and its suburbs. The line currently runs from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in Woodlawn to Middle River, both in Baltimore County, Maryland (on opposite sides) with selected trips terminating at Downtown Baltimore City Hall, passing through the west and east sides and the downtown area of Baltimore City. Service operates every 12 minutes during rush hour, and every 15 minutes at most other times during its hours of operation. The line serves the corridors of Edmondson Avenue in West Baltimore, including the communities of Edmondson Village, Allendale, and Rosemont, and Fayette Street and Eastern Avenue in East Baltimore, serving Patterson Park, Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center and Essex.

Unlike a local bus, the 40 does not stop at every bus stop along its route. Rather, its stops are limited to certain locations of importance, including transfer points to other bus lines, major landmarks, and other busy intersections selected by MTA. In all, there are 32 stops along the route in each direction, which are all identified in printed timetables.

History
The Route 40 started operating on October 23, 2005 as part of the Greater Baltimore Bus Initiative, a plan of then-governor Robert L. Ehrlich for streamlining and simplifying the Baltimore transit system. Unlike a rail line, this addition did not require any construction. The bus route was intended to resemble the proposed Red Line that is currently being studied for the Baltimore region.

When it started operating, Route 40 ran from Security Square Mall to the Essex Park-and-Ride lot on Eastern Avenue. Weekday service operated every 10 minutes during rush hour and midday. On February 5 the following year, it was extended to Middle River and reduced to one bus every 12–15 minutes.

On June 10, 2007, the eastern layover was moved to a safer location at Old Eastern and Vincent Avenues. The western layover was moved to CMS on February 8, 2009 and the stop at Security Square Mall was moved from the parking lot of the mall to a point along Security Boulevard adjacent to the mall lot.

Quickbus 40 PLUS Service
Enhanced service for West Baltimore residents on the QuickBus 40 will begin October 25th, 2015.  The enhanced service will increase frequency and reliability on the line between the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid in Baltimore County and City Hall in Baltimore City.

Customer will find additional bus trips added on west side between CMS and City Hall to enhance off-peak and weekend access to jobs.

Criticism

Route 40 received a lot of criticism following its inauguration from riders, politicians, and the media. This criticism resulted in some changes being made to the route, schedule, and other details.

The service, which was projected to have a daily ridership level of 27,000, fell far short of that goal. Many riders waiting for other buses at common stops complained about seeing a lot of empty Route 40 buses. This resulted in its weekday frequency being reduced.

Low ridership and unrealistic time allocation initially being built into the schedule resulted in poor on-time performance and buses clumping together. As one bus fell behind schedule while busy picking up passengers, the one behind it got ahead after stops had been cleared of waiting passengers, and ultimately caught up to the earlier bus. This left larger gaps between buses.

Financial resources needed in order to operate this service were obtained by cutting back on the amount of local bus service along common streets of operation, mostly on Route 23, which had its level of service cut by nearly 50% when Route 40 was introduced. This brought the number of local buses on these busy streets below the demand.

The service's original route had an eastern terminus at Essex Park-and-Ride lot, which was more than a mile short of the transfer point for some other lines, including Routes 24 and 55. An extension in February 2006 to Middle River allowed riders to transfer directly to those routes.

On the west side of the route, there is no designated Park-and-Ride lot allowing motorists to park their vehicles and catch the bus. Security Square Mall has not allocated any spaces for riders of Route 40, and an existing park-and-ride lot at the end of I-70 is not within a practical or pedestrian friendly walk of a bus stop.

While rapid transit lines are generally modeled for commuter purposes, QuickBus is marketed only to those who do not own vehicles and depend on a neighborhood bus stop.

Tracking of buses
At 11 stops along the route, a new experimental system was installed late in 2006. Electronic signs at these stops, tied into a GPS system, indicate the expected time of arrival for the next bus, so riders do not have to rely on a less reliable printed schedule. MTA is considering implementing this system at many more bus stops along other routes in the future.

This system has been highly criticized. It is expensive, and money spent on it has not been spent on improving bus service around the Baltimore area. Even when fully in place, these signs will only be found at a small percentage of bus stops, and will not be useful to everyone.

QuickBus Structuring
On December 21, 2006, Bus Route 40 was rebranded as ""QuickBus"" in order to better promote the service. Special pylons were added at selected stops to mark the locations.

The name ""QuickBus"" was synonymous with Bus Route 40 until August 30, 2009, when another QuickBus line, known as Route 48, started operation along the Greenmount Ave/York Rd corridor. The MTA had added two more QuickBus lines: Route 46 and Route 47 on August 29, 2010.

2005 establishments in Maryland"," Route 40 (MTA Maryland) Route 40 is a BaltimoreLink transit bus route, and is the successor to the Route M-40. It is a radial route that runs between Downtown Baltimore and the Perry Hill neighborhood in northeast Baltimore. It is the third most-traveled route in the system, after Route 40 and Route 15. The route travels through Downtown Baltimore along Howard Street, passing the Baltimore Arena, Maryland Historical Society, Baltimore City Hall, and the main branch of the Baltimore Public Library. It then travels northeast on Monument Street, passing the Baltimore Museum of Art and Johns Hopkins University. The route then travels along North Charles Street, passing the former St. Mary's Industrial Park, now known as Baltimore Highlands, and the future site of the Baltimore Metro SubwayLink extension to the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center. The route then travels along Eastern Avenue and Belvedere Avenue before terminating in the Perry Hill neighborhood. In 2005, a study was conducted to examine the potential for a rapid transit line on Route 40. The study examined the construction of a light rail line, an aerial tram, and an automated people mover. The study found that the light rail option would be the best fit for the corridor, with the potential to have a major impact on reducing traffic congestion and stimulating transit-oriented development.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Megaupload legal case"", the article should at least have 250 words","The Megaupload legal case concerns a number of related criminal indictments and enforcement actions taken against Megaupload owner Kim Dotcom in various jurisdictions. On 19 January 2012 the United States Department of Justice seized and shut down the file-hosting site Megaupload.com and commenced criminal cases against its owners and others. On 20 January 2012 Hong Kong Customs froze more than 300 million Hong Kong dollars (US$39 million) in assets belonging to the company.

Arrests in New Zealand
Acting upon a US Federal prosecutor's request, the New Zealand Police arrested Dotcom and three other Megaupload executives in a leased $30 million mansion at Coatesville near Auckland on Friday, 20 January 2012 (NZDT, UTC+13). This was pursuant to a request from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation that the four be extradited for racketeering and money laundering. The raid was timed for the birthday celebration of Dotcom. Assets worth $17 million including art works and cars were seized. The four men arrested were Kim Dotcom (founder; 38 years old, from Germany), Finn Batato (Chief marketing officer (CMO); 38, from Germany), Mathias Ortmann (Chief technology officer (CTO) and co-founder; 40, from Germany) and Bram van der Kolk (29, from the Netherlands). The number of police officers involved in this operation was about 80 according to Dotcom or 20 to 30 according to the New Zealand police.

On 23 January, Dotcom appeared in Auckland's North Shore District Court for a bail hearing. The crown argued against bail on the basis that he was a flight risk with a helicopter on his front lawn, while defence lawyers argued that the helicopter could not fly far enough to reach another country. They also said that Dotcom denied any criminal wrongdoing. Judge David McNaughton expressed concern at the discovery of two shotguns at Dotcom's mansion during the police raid, and deferred a decision on whether to grant bail, saying that he needed more time to review the submissions. The request for bail was turned down, with Judge McNaughton saying that ""he was denied due to the risk [that] Mr. Dotcom would flee jurisdiction and the possibility that if he reached Germany he wouldn't be extradited to face the charges"". On 3 February 2012, an appeal to the High Court of New Zealand upheld the decision to deny bail.

On 22 February 2012, North Shore District Court Judge Nevin Dawson overturned the previous rulings and granted bail to Kim Dotcom, saying that the risk of flight had diminished after his assets had been seized.

On 5 March 2012, a formal request for the extradition to the United States of Kim Dotcom and three other senior Megaupload staff was filed in a New Zealand court.

On 30 April 2012, the New Zealand High Court ruled that around $750,000 of Kim Dotcom's assets could be returned, including a Mercedes-Benz G55 AMG and Toyota Vellfire that had been seized during the raid on his home. The assets in 63 bank accounts and around thirty other vehicles remained in custody. A paperwork error by the New Zealand authorities meant that Kim Dotcom's property had been seized in January 2012 without giving proper notice. The restraining order on his property was granted in April 2012. During April 2012, US district court judge Liam O'Grady stated ""I frankly don't know that we are ever going to have a trial in this matter,"" as he found out that the company had never been formally served with criminal papers by the US.

On 28 June 2012, New Zealand High Court justice Helen Winkelmann ruled that the search warrants used to raid the home of Kim Dotcom were invalid, saying ""The warrants did not adequately describe the offences to which they related. They were general warrants, and as such, are invalid.""

On 10 July 2012, a decision on whether Kim Dotcom and other Megaupload employees should be extradited to the United States was delayed until March 2013, in order to allow further time for legal arguments to be heard. In December 2012, it was delayed until August 2013.

In March 2013, Dotcom won a Court of Appeal ruling allowing him to sue the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB), rejecting the attorney-general's appeal against a ruling in December, 2012.

On 19 February 2014, a New Zealand appeals court overruled the 28 June 2012 decision, declaring the search warrants against Kim Dotcom to be valid. Dotcom's extradition hearing was set for July 2014.

On 8 September 2014, the Court of Appeal ruled that the New Zealand Police is to return seized electronic devices unencrypted back to Dotcom and those involved.

Basis of indictment

The indictment alleged that Megaupload differed from other online file storage businesses.

Media reports covering the case highlighted a number of points from the indictment used to support claims of illegal activity. The indictment provided a number of instances alleged to show criminal behaviour, as well as indicating design points of Megaupload's operating model as being evidence of criminal intent:

 In practice, the ""vast majority"" of users do not have any significant long term private storage capability. Continued storage is dependent upon regular downloads of the file occurring. Files not downloaded are rapidly removed in most cases, whereas popular downloaded files are retained. (items 7 – 8)
 Because only a small portion of users pay for storage, the business is dependent upon advertising. Adverts are primarily viewed when files are downloaded and the business model is therefore not based upon storage but upon maximising downloads. (items 7 – 8)
 Persons indicted have ""instructed individual users how to locate links to infringing content on the Mega Sites ... [and] ... have also shared with each other comments from Mega Site users demonstrating that they have used or are attempting to use the Mega Sites to get infringing copies of copyrighted content."" (item 13)
 Persons indicted, unlike the public, are not reliant upon links to stored files, but can search the internal database directly. It is claimed they have ""searched the internal database for their associates and themselves so that they may directly access copyright-infringing content"". (item 14)
 A comprehensive takedown method is in use to identify child pornography, but not deployed to remove infringing content. (item 24)
 Infringing users did not have their accounts terminated, and the defendants ""made no significant effort to identify users who were using the Mega Sites or services to infringe copyrights, to prevent the uploading of infringing copies of copyrighted materials, or to identify infringing copies of copyrighted works"" (item 55–56)
 An incentivising program was adopted encouraging the upload of ""popular"" files in return for payments to successful uploaders. (item 69e et al.)
 Defendants explicitly discussed evasion and infringement issues, including an attempt to copy and upload the entire content of YouTube. (items 69i-l. YouTube: items 69 i,j,l,s)

Counter arguments advanced 
Schmitz hired the services of Ira Rothken, an attorney who defended several copyright infringement cases. Rothken claims that the raid was unjustly swift and did not give his client the opportunity to defend himself, quoting a similar case involving YouTube as an example of a completely different turnout.

Legal commentators point out that while the indictment may be correct and Megaupload might have acted as a criminal conspiracy as claimed, a number of points in the indictment are based upon selective interpretations and legal concepts (described in one article as ""novel theories"" of the law) and could be challenged in court. An L.A. Times analysis stated that the author was ""struck by how far the indictment goes to find something nefarious""; likewise a TechDirt analysis concluded that while the founder of Megaupload had a significant history of ""flaunting the law"", evidence has potentially been taken out of context or misrepresented and could ""come back to haunt other online services who are providing perfectly legitimate services"". Both analyses concur that other evidence could show criminality; the concerns were not irrefutable. The legal concerns included:

 Indictment cites lack of a site search as evidence supporting criminality, but in other copyright cases having a site search has been described as evidence in support of criminality and in Atari v. RapidShare not having a site search was agreed by the court as evidence of responsible activity given that some infringing content might exist and be searched for if one existed. In the case of Isohunt, the presence of a search feature was interpreted as evidence of inducement. TechDirt commented that ""To use the lack of a feature, that previously was shown to be a problem, as evidence of a conspiracy is crazy. Damned if you do, damned if you don't.""
 The ""top 100"" list excluded copyrighted titles, but the indictment claims this was evidence of concealing, rather than avoiding downloads of, infringing materials.
 The indictment asserts as evidence that no effort was made to identify infringing files or users, in other words by acts of omission. But federal court rulings repeatedly agree that no duty exists to search these out. In particular, in MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd. the Supreme Court looked at ""substantial noninfringing uses""; mere lack of monitoring was not by itself sufficient to show wrongdoing or inducement. It may not be possible (or reasonable to require) the host to know and identify what activity is legitimate or not, as file sharing may be used by many content creators.
 Deletion after a limited period of non-download is suggested as evidence of a motive. But many legitimate sites such as Imgur remove unused content after a while to free up server space. If files were routinely deleted after a short period it could equally suggest legitimate use - because it serves users who share legitimately for a short while, and enforces removal afterwards.
 Much of the indictment, in the words of one analysis, ""seems to be based on the simple assumption that encouraging more usage means they must be encouraging infringement"", in other words there should be evidence of actual wrongdoing, not merely evidence of popular use. Many legitimate files are popular and popularly shared, and an assumption that paid use largely equates to infringing use would need evidence.
 Failure to remove all links following a takedown request is often legitimate. For example the same content may be uploaded by legitimate and illegitimate users. Removing the infringing link does not affect legitimate uploaders. Removing the infringing file would wrongfully cause it to be deleted for legitimate users too. Similarly, once child pornography is identified, it is always illegal for all users. But other material may be legal for some users and not for others. So the fact one case requires file removal and the other only requires link removal may well be correct conduct.
 The indictment includes money laundering charges. But these include ""basic payments"" for web hosting, suggesting ""lumping in"" — adding matters that are in no way illegal to make a case look bad.
 Megaupload had indicated willingness to attend court in the U.S. already, and answer civil cases.

Safe harbor provisions
The US Digital Millennium Copyright Act provides safe harbor for sites that promptly take down infringing content. Safe harbor does not exist if the site has actual knowledge and does nothing about it.

In Megaupload's case, the indictment alleges DMCA provisions were used for the appearance of legitimacy – the actual material was not removed, only some links to it were, takedowns agreement was approved based on business growth rather than infringement, and the parties themselves openly discussed their infringing activities. The indictment claims that Megaupload executives:

... are willfully infringing copyrights themselves on these systems; have actual knowledge that the materials on their systems are infringing (or alternatively know facts or circumstances that would make infringing material apparent); receive a financial benefit directly attributable to copyright-infringing activity where the provider can control that activity; and have not removed, or disabled access to, known copyright infringing material from servers they control.

Prosecutors claimed in the indictment that Megaupload was not DMCA compliant, and cited the example of an alleged infringer on the site known as ""VV."" Over six years, VV had allegedly uploaded nearly 17,000 files to Megavideo.com, resulting in more than 334 million views. According to prosecutors, although numerous takedown e-mails had been sent, none of the files had been deleted.

In a television interview with 3 News, Kim Dotcom denied being a ""piracy king"", and claimed that Megaupload had applied the provisions of the DMCA and went beyond it, by giving copyright holders direct rights to delete links. He also claimed that the indictment relied on a malicious interpretation of technical issues to construe its claim of criminal intent, and that there was significant legal use of Megaupload.

Criminal defense action
Kim Dotcom denied the charges filed against him, and retained the services of Ira P. Rothken, an attorney who has defended several copyright infringement cases. Ira Rothken stated that there is no criminal liability for secondary copyright infringement under US law, quoting a similar case involving YouTube as an example of similar accusations which were dealt with as a civil case.

Dotcom initially hired Washington, D.C. attorney Robert Bennett, who had confirmed that he was going to represent Megaupload in the piracy case. On 22 January 2012, Bennett withdrew from the case due to a conflict of interest with another client. As of 23 January, barrister Paul Davison QC was quoted as representing Megaupload's founder, Kim Dotcom, in New Zealand. At the end of April 2012, a controversy emerged over legal representation. The law firm Quinn Emanuel, retained by Megaupload to argue for the retention of Megaupload's data, claimed in a motion filed to the court that there was a concerted effort by the United States Department of Justice to deny Megaupload fair legal representation. In the brief, Quinn Emanuel alleged that several law firms had dropped out of the case after the DoJ wrote to them over potential conflicts of interest, arguing that they wanted to call clients of the firms as witnesses. Given the size of the Megaupload, Quinn Emanuel claimed that this ""conflict of interest"" argument could be applied to any law firm with experience in intellectual property rights, denying Megaupload experienced representation in a case where both law and technical issues are involved. Quinn Emanuel received such a letter but rejected the DoJ's arguments.

Techdirt argued that while the founder of Megaupload had a significant history of ""flouting the law"", evidence had potentially been taken out of context or misrepresented and could ""come back to haunt other online services who are providing perfectly legitimate services"". Eric Goldman, a professor of law at Santa Clara University, described the Megaupload case as ""a depressing display of abuse of government authority"". He pointed out that criminal copyright infringement requires that willful infringement has taken place, and that taking Megaupload offline had produced the ""deeply unconstitutional effect"" of denying legitimate users of the site access to their data. Other legal commentators have disagreed with Goldman's assessment of the copyright charges, concluding that the allegations in the indictment, if proven, would support a guilty finding on charges of aiding and abetting copyright infringement. Professor James Grimmelmann, for example, commented, ""If proven at trial, there's easily enough in the indictment to prove criminal copyright infringement many times over.""

The defense has drawn on procedural errors by the prosecution to challenge the case. In a judgement in the end of May, NZ Judge David Harvey granted the defendants the right to the disclosure of evidence against them held by the FBI in preparation for the extradition trial. In his 81-page decision, he came to the assessment that the DoJ is attempting to use concepts of civil law, in particular secondary copyright infringement, in a criminal case, which creates legal issues. He also confirmed that the charges in the indictment relating to money laundering, racketeering and wire fraud are not separate criminal acts but dependent on the claim of criminal secondary copyright infringement. In a separate development in the United States, the defense has challenged the case against Megaupload as a whole, claiming that the US has no jurisdiction over a foreign company and that the seizure of Megaupload's assets was unlawful. A second brief points out numerous legal errors in the indictment, declaring it ""an experiment in stretching U.S. criminal law well past the breaking point.""

Data retention
Following the seizure of Megaupload, concerns were raised as to what would happen to the files that had been uploaded by its users. On 20 January 2012, the Justice Department stated that ""It is important to note that Mega clearly warned users to keep copies of any files they uploaded"" adding that ""Megaupload.com expressly informed users through its Frequently Asked Questions ('FAQs') and its Terms of Service that users have no proprietary interest in any of the files on Megaupload's servers, they assume the full risk of complete loss or unavailability of their data, and that Megaupload can terminate site operations without prior notice."" On 27 January 2012, U.S. Attorney Neil H. MacBride wrote:

The Mega Servers are not in the actual or constructive custody or control of the United States, but remain at the premises controlled by, and currently under the control of, Carpathia and Cogent. Should the defendants wish to obtain independent access to the Mega Servers, or coordinate third-party access to data housed on Mega Servers, the issue must be resolved directly with Cogent or Carpathia.

In response, on 30 January 2012, Carpathia Hosting denied having access to MegaUpload files and issued a press release stating

Carpathia Hosting does not have, and has never had, access to the content on MegaUpload servers and has no mechanism for returning any content residing on such servers to MegaUpload's customers. The reference to the 2 February 2012 date in the Department of Justice letter for the deletion of content is not based on any information provided by Carpathia to the U.S. Government. We would recommend that anyone who believes that they have content on MegaUpload servers contact MegaUpload. Please do not contact Carpathia Hosting.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation has started a campaign to allow legitimate users of Megaupload in the US access to their data and wants the data preserved for that reason. It has chosen to represent one such legitimate user in court and thus has sided with Megaupload and Carpathia in asking the court to retain the data.

On 26 April 2012, Megaupload data negotiations began. Carpathia reported that maintaining the data costs over US$9,000 a day, and wanted to seek a formal resolution on whether to delete the data or release it to interested parties. United States district court Judge Liam O'Grady ordered all parties to return to the negotiating table. The U.S. Department of Justice noted that US$35 million had been paid by Megaupload to Carpathia, and alleged that Carpathia had knowingly profited from copyright infringement.

Retaliatory attacks by Anonymous
Following the shutdown of the Megaupload website, the website of the United States Department of Justice and a number of other websites were taken offline following concerted denial of service attacks attributed to Anonymous.

Gizmodo concurred that it was ""almost certainly the result of a quickly assembled DDoS [Distributed Denial of Service] attack—and easily the widest in scope and ferocity we've seen in some time"", commenting that ""if you had any doubts Anonymous is still a hacker wrecking ball, doubt no more"". Links posted in chatrooms and on Twitter, when clicked on by unsuspecting Internet users, ran a web version of the application known as the Low Orbit Ion Cannon.
On 19 January 2012, Anonymous released a statement on Pastebin.com accepting responsibility of the mass attacks on websites including those of RIAA, MPAA, BMI, FBI, and others. According to the Russian state-run RT network, Anonymous described the attacks as ""the single largest Internet attack in its history"".

Other reactions
Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy said he was satisfied with the shutdown of the website. He found the site's operators were reaping ""criminal profits from the illegal distribution of copyrighted works"". ""The time has come for increased judicial and police co-operation between states"" in the fight against online piracy, he said in a statement.

Web organisations have raised concerns about possible effects of the Megaupload case on the future of file sharing, cloud storage, and Internet commerce. Various commentators including John C. Dvorak, Glenn Greenwald, and Julian Sanchez have written on the topic as well, particularly as it relates US government powers to take down a web site without a trial, even without new laws like SOPA. In fact, the U.S. Dept of Justice was able to rely on PRO-IP, a law passed back in 2008, in order to shut down Megaupload.

People who used Megaupload for personal and business storage, such as large audio and video files for family and work, have also voiced their complaints about the fact that they no longer had access to their files on the service. Examples cited in the media included staff at public interest group Public Knowledge who used it for large files, and Android cellphone software writers who described it as ""one of the best ways to distribute [software] ... There are a number of similar sites for this use, but Megaupload was always the fastest"".

In response to the shutdown, a number of other file hosting websites changed the functionality of their services. FileSonic.com, one of the top ten file hosting services, withdrew the ability to share links to files. The site's main page added a banner stating ""All sharing functionality on FileSonic is now disabled. Our service can only be used to upload and retrieve files that you have uploaded personally."" Other file hosting websites followed suit, including FileServe.com, FileJungle.com, Uploadstation.com, x7.to and 4shared.com, by shutting down, cancelling affiliate programs or allowing users to only download what they themselves uploaded. Another large file-sharing website, Uploaded.to, ceased services for users accessing from United States-based IP addresses. BTJunkie, a website indexing torrent files, shut down voluntarily on 6 February 2012. The file hosting site Turbobit.net blocked access to U.S. visitors, and QuickSilverScreen, a site offering streaming video links, closed on 7 February 2012.

However, other file hosting companies felt no need to change, with MediaFire's CEO Derek Labian saying that he and his file hosting company are not concerned by the Megaupload incident because ""Megaupload was making a ridiculous amount of money with a ridiculously bad service... We don't have a business built on copyright infringement."" A spokesperson for RapidShare similarly expressed a lack of concern, saying that ""file hosting itself is a legitimate business"", pointing out that Microsoft's OneDrive operates on a similar basis.

New Zealand–United States relations"," Megaupload legal case On 19 January 2012, the United States Department of Justice charged seven individuals and two companies, Megaupload and Megavideo, with criminal copyright infringement. The companies' two principal owners, Kim Dotcom and his wife Mona, were arrested in New Zealand on 20 January 2012. The investigation into Megaupload began in 2008, when the company's website was used to store and distribute a pirated copy of the film The Hurt Locker. In 2010, an investigator took advantage of Megaupload's policy of giving free storage space to users who uploaded a large number of files, and uploaded a large number of files himself, none of which were copyright-infringing. This allowed the investigator to download the rest of the files on the site without any copyright-infringing material, and he identified several other copyrighted works that had been uploaded to the site. In August 2010, the FBI obtained a search warrant to enter the residences of Dotcom and his colleagues, but delayed the execution of the search warrant to avoid potential diplomatic complications, as Dotcom's residence was in New Zealand, a country with which the United States has an extradition treaty. The FBI obtained additional warrants to search the Megaupload corporate offices in Hong Kong and the Megavideo corporate offices in the United States. On 9 February 2012, Dotcom's lawyers filed a ""Notice of Intention to Stand on Defective Search Warrant"" in New Zealand. On 17 February 2012, the New Zealand High Court ruled that the search warrants were invalid, as the court had not been presented with evidence of criminal copyright infringement. As a result, the New Zealand government officially returned the seized property to Dotcom. On 20 February 2012, the U.S. government filed a request with the New Zealand government to extradite Dotcom. In July 2012, the New Zealand government rejected the request, citing that the United States had not provided enough information to extradite Dotcom, and that Dotcom's arrest had been improper. On 24 August 2012, the United States launched a second request for Dotcom's extradition. In December 2012, New Zealand granted the United States' request, and Dotcom's legal team launched a second appeal. On 17 April 2013, the New Zealand Court of Appeal ruled that Dotcom could be extradited to the United States. Dotcom's legal team stated that they would file a further appeal with the New Zealand Supreme Court. In February 2013, the United States Department of Justice had stated that it was working to have Dotcom returned to the United States, and that ""the proper thing to do is for New Zealand to extradite Mr. Dotcom to the United States.""",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,36627336,0.13019891500904163,0.14736842105263157,0.37345083651676186,0.42990654205607476,8,14,0,0,18,0,1,0,0,1,0.3609913593279879,0.031825694031904245,0.008423087544877106,0.03194103194103194,11,0,45,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,25,1,37,1,1,1
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Arroyo Seco bicycle path"", the article should at least have 250 words","The Arroyo Seco Bicycle Path is an approximately  long Class I bicycle path along the Arroyo Seco river channel in the Northeast Los Angeles region of Los Angeles County, California.    It parallels to the Arroyo Seco Parkway (CA Route 110) also in the canyon.

Description
The bicycle path connects: Montecito Heights at Ernest E. Debs Regional Park and the Montecito Heights Recreation Center; Hermon at Hermon Park and Ernest E. Debs Regional Park; and Highland Park at Sycamore Grove Park -- to the city of South Pasadena at the Arroyo Seco Stables.  The pathway travels under the cover of tall California sycamore and California oak trees

The southwest portion of the path, approximately , runs along the top of the channel and overlooks the Arroyo Seco through chain-link fencing. It then descends into the bed of Arroyo Seco flood control channel for the rest of the route. Following the channel hydraulics, there is a  slight and consistent uphill grade in the northeast/upstream direction, with some sections under overpasses having slightly greater slopes.

Parking and access are located at Hermon Park/Arroyo Seco Park, Sycamore Grove Park, Ernest E. Debs Regional Park, and the Montecito Heights Recreation Center. The Sycamore Grove Park access is via a pedestrian bridge over the Arroyo Seco.  The path crosses several other pedestrian and vehicular bridges along its route.

Closures
For flood safety reasons, if rain is predicted or if water release is expected from the upstream dam, public access is not permitted in the channel.

Connectivity
The path continues as a walking and equestrian trail from its northern terminus, with only pedestrians and horses allowed beyond the Arroyo Seco Stables. However, bicyclists can continue on the Kenneth Newell Bikeway along Arroyo Boulevard just to the east, a quiet residential street that continues north in the Arroyo Seco to the Rose Bowl Stadium in Pasadena.  

From the path's southern terminus, the open air Heritage Square Museum and the Lummis House and gardens are nearby. Connections southwards to the Los Angeles River Bicycle Path several miles away are via the vehicle shared Figuroa Street to Riverside Drive.

Maintenance
The Arroyo Seco Bicycle Path is maintained by City of Los Angeles.  The Arroyo Seco river channel that the bike path is located in is maintained by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works.

Hazards
Especially after rain events, storm-borne debris accumulate on the path and pose danger to cyclist and pedestrians. Other hazards include trash and debris, such as beverage bottles, shopping carts, and electronics that are being illegally discarded into the channel from bridge overpasses. Due to periodical maintenance activities, the path is usually clear from any debris and provides an enjoyable recreational area.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Cosmos Engineering"", the article should at least have 250 words","Cosmos Engineering was a company that manufactured aero-engines in a factory in Fishponds, Bristol during World War I. Sir Roy Fedden, the company's principal designer, developed the 14-cylinder radial Mercury engine during this period. The company was taken over by the Bristol Aeroplane Company in 1920.

Company origins
In 1918 the Anglo-American company Cosmos bought Straker-Squire (also known as Brazil Straker), a car and bus manufacturing firm which had branched out into aircraft engine repair and manufacture. This began by first reconditioning, then substantially redesigning and re-manufacturing Curtiss OX-5 engines. Due to the quality of this work, they were the only company permitted to manufacture Rolls-Royce aircraft engines under licence, building Hawk and Falcon engines, major components for the Eagle engine and also 600 Renault 80hp 8Ca engines. Over 1,500 engines were produced in total. The company was one of the first to be brought under Admiralty control, and Fedden and his draughtsman Leonard Butler designed two engines during the war; the 14-cylinder Mercury and the larger, 9-cylinder Jupiter.

Aero-engine range

In 1919 the range consisted of the 450 hp Jupiter, the 300 hp Mercury and the smaller 100 hp Lucifer. On 9 April 1919 a Bristol Scout F fitted with a Mercury engine set two British records at Farnborough achieving the time to 10,000 ft and 20,000 ft records.

Car production
Despite selling off the engineering side of Brazil Straker, which continued to successfully build cars, Cosmos Engineering also produced a small number of Fedden-designed cars. The Cosmos 10.5 of 1919, featured an air cooled 3cyl radial layout 994cc engine of 16 hp and was significantly innovative for its time. Only a limited number were made, and it was followed up by the larger 10.5 CAR which never got beyond prototype stage.

Fate
Soon afterwards the company went into liquidation and was taken over by the Bristol Aeroplane Company in 1920. Operations then moved to a former flying school located on the northern edge of Filton Aerodrome. The factory on Lodge Causeway was subsequently taken over by Parnall & Sons for shop and ship fitting and aircraft component manufacturing.

The company was founded in 1922 as the Southampton Electric Engineering Company by Percy Harrison, an electrical engineer who had previously worked for the British Army during World War I. In 1925, the company changed its name to Cosmos Engineering Limited. The company initially manufactured electrical motors and fans, and later expanded into the manufacture of kitchen appliances, such as electric kettles, toasters, and grills. Cosmos Engineering was one of the first companies to manufacture electric kettles with a water level gauge and an automatic cut-off switch to prevent the kettle from boiling dry. In the early 1930s, the company began manufacturing electric shavers, which were marketed under the brand name ""Astra"". The company also manufactured vacuum cleaners, which were marketed under the brand name ""Dirt Devil"". Cosmos Engineering was acquired by the American electrical equipment manufacturer General Electric in 1955. The company continued to operate as a subsidiary of General Electric until the early 1970s, when it was acquired by the British electrical equipment manufacturer Hotpoint. In 1979, Cosmos Engineering was acquired by the French electrical equipment manufacturer Moulinex.

Canadian expatriates in the United States"," Marc-Adélard Tremblay (born 22 February 1888 in Montreal – died 7 April 1982 in Montreal) was a Canadian astronomer, astrophysicist, and meteorologist. He was the director of the Observatoire de l'Instruction publique (OIP) in Quebec from its founding in 1929 until 1962, and was the author of more than 170 scientific publications, including a four-volume work on the Sun and three other astronomical textbooks. Tremblay was born in Montreal, Quebec. He was educated at the Séminaire de Saint-Jérôme and the Collège de Montreal, and received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Montreal in 1908. He then went on to earn his Master of Science degree from the University of Toronto in 1912 and a Doctor of Science degree from the University of Paris in 1924. In 1912, Tremblay joined the faculty of the University of Montreal as an assistant professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy. He became a full professor in 1927 and served as the dean of the Faculty of Science from 1944 to 1950. In 1929, he founded the Observatoire de l'Instruction publique (OIP) in Quebec and served as its director until 1962. The OIP was a teaching and research observatory that was affiliated with the University of Montreal.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Local Journalism Sustainability Act"", the article should at least have 250 words","The Local Journalism Sustainability Act () is a bill introduced into the United States House of Representatives on July 16, 2020, by Representative Ann Kirkpatrick (D-AZ-2). On November 12, it received another co-sponsor bringing the total to 78 (20 Republicans and 58 Democrats).  This act would provide tax credits to support local newspapers:  

 Up to $250 per year per individual to cover 80 percent of subscription fees to local newspapers for the first tax year and 50 percent for subsequent tax years (4-1 match the first year, 1-1 match for an additional four years).
 Up to $12,500 per quarter ($50,000 per year) to reduce employment taxes for a local newspaper to hire and pay journalists.
 Up to $5,000 per year for a small business to cover 80 percent of advertising with local media (local newspapers or broadcast stations) the first year after this act takes effect and up to $2,500 per year for another four years to cover 50 percent of such advertising.  
 
This act defines a ‘local newspaper’ as any print or digital publication whose (A) primary content is news and current events, and (B) at least 51 percent of its readers (including both print and digital versions) reside in a single (i) State or a single possession of the United States, or (ii) area with a 200-mile radius.  To qualify, a 'local newspaper' must have been in continuous operation for two years prior to the enactment of this bill.

The bill was reintroduced to the 117th congress in 2021 ( and ).

Discussion  

On July 21, 2020, The Arizona Republic discussed this bill, noting that, “More than 150 news companies and papers have undergone pay cuts, furloughs, layoffs or even shut their doors for good as a result of the pandemic, according to the Poynter Institute, a journalism think tank."" More recent reports from the Poynter Institute document further reductions in news. 

The bill is supported by multiple organizations concerned about the decline of local newspapers and the threat that poses to democracy.

 David Chavern, the President and CEO of News Media Alliance, wrote, ""As journalists are on the front lines reporting on the coronavirus crisis, ... local news publishers have been dealt a major blow from the contraction of the local advertising market. The Local Journalism Sustainability Act ... would help ensure local news publishers survive the current crises, and that they are around to cover the next ones.""

 Dean Ridings, CEO of America’s Newspapers, reminded readers of what happened to Bell, California, a suburb of Los Angeles with only 37,000 people of modest incomes, after its local newspaper died in 1998 or shortly thereafter:  When the Los Angeles Times started reporting on it in  2010, the city was almost bankrupt in spite of major tax increases, because the city council had voted huge increases in annual compensation to roughly $100,000 for council members, $450,000 for the police chief, and almost $800,000 for the city manager.

 Other supporters include Editor & Publisher, an American monthly magazine serving the newspaper industry, and the Hoosier State Press Association. 

Jack Shafer, who writes about media for Politico, said, “Nobody will miss newspapers more than me when they finally vanish.” However, publishers and journalist may not honestly report on certain issues and events, given the history of politicians (usually Republicans like Mr. Trump) threatening to defund NPR and PBS when they don't like the coverage. He asked, ""You wouldn't put a dead man on a ventilator, would you?"" Editor and Publisher Magazine took position to Shafer's opinions about the eventual death of newspapers in a 2020 editorial penned by Publisher Mike Blinder, which stated ""there are thousands of smaller community newspapers that are still operating with decent profits and serving their communities that lack other news outlets."" And went on to cite: ""Community publishers generally operate with much more efficiencies than the big market dailies and have better relationships with the local advertising community. Plus, they perform a necessary, critical service (as mandated in the Constitution) of making the local government accountable to the people they serve, or as some say: “Speak truth to power.” These are the cities and counties that must continue to have an authoritative, credible voice through this crisis and beyond.

The commission's work will inform the NEH's plans for the future and will also be used to inform the planning of other federal, state, and local policy makers. The fifteen members of the commission were appointed by NEH Chairman William ""Bro"" Adams, and include prominent leaders in the humanities and social sciences, higher education, and public life. The commission is co-chaired by former Secretary of Education William J. Bennett and Harvard University President Lawrence H. Summers. The commission's first meeting took place on July 30, 2013, at the NEH headquarters in Washington, DC. At that meeting, the commission began its work on a report that will be delivered to the NEH in June 2014. The report will include recommendations ""for a vibrant and durable future for the humanities and social sciences."" In addition to its report to the NEH, the commission will also publish a report for a broad audience of policy makers, opinion leaders, and the general public. The commission will hold additional meetings in Washington, DC, and will also hold meetings in the field, where it will have an opportunity to learn more about the work being done in the humanities and social sciences, and the impact of that work on communities across the United States. The National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) is an independent federal agency that funds and promotes research, education, and public programs in the humanities. The NEH is one of the largest federal supporters of the humanities in the United States.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Odeonsplatz"", the article should at least have 250 words","The Odeonsplatz is a large square in central Munich which was developed in the early 19th century by Leo von Klenze and is at the southern end of the Ludwigstraße, developed at the same time. The square is named for the former concert hall, the Odeon, on its northwestern side. The name Odeonsplatz has come to be extended to the parvis (forecourt) of the Residenz, in front of the Theatine Church and terminated by the Feldherrnhalle, which lies to the south of it. The square was the scene of a fatal gun battle which ended the march on the Feldherrnhalle during the 1923 Beer Hall Putsch.

Location and buildings
The Odeonsplatz is located north of the Old Town, on the border between Altstadt-Lehel (to the east) and Maxvorstadt (to the west). On the west side, which is set back from the line of the Ludwigstraße,  are the building of the Odeon (1826–28, now the Bavarian Ministry of the Interior) and the identical Palais Leuchtenberg (1817–21, now the Bavarian State Ministry of Finance), both modelled on the Palazzo Farnese in Rome. On the east side is Klenze's Bazaar Building, including the Café Tambosi. Between the two buildings on the west side, an unnamed street leads to the Palais Ludwig Ferdinand (1825–26, now the headquarters of Siemens). Both this street and the Brienner Straße, which begins at the south end of the square, lead to the adjacent Wittelsbacherplatz, also designed by Klenze.

The Feldherrnhalle is a copy of the famous Loggia dei Lanzi in Florence.

The Odeonsplatz is served by the U Bahn station of the same name and by the Museenlinie (museum line) of the Munich bus system. Since 1972, the southern end of the square has been part of the central Munich pedestrian zone.

History

As early as 1790, plans were made in connection with the removal of the old city walls to replace the Schwabing Gate (Schwabinger Tor) with a new square and to make the beginning of the route from the Residenz to Nymphenburg Palace (the Fürstenweg, now Brienner Straße) more impressive. The current form of the square and the parvis to the south of it was determined by King Ludwig I of Bavaria, who in 1816, while still Crown Prince, commissioned Klenze to lay out the whole of the Ludwigstraße, including the square at its southern end. The Italianate neo-classical style of the first building, the Palais Leuchtenberg, set the tone, and unlike earlier plans by Friedrich Ludwig von Sckell which had featured buildings surrounded by a parklike setting, Klenze created an enclosed urban square to better fit with the adjacent Old Town. However, the Feldherrnhalle, erected to close the view at the southern end on the site of the demolished gate, was commissioned from Klenze's rival Friedrich von Gärtner in 1840–41. As the building of the square continued, the project expanded to include the new Ludwigstraße; originally it had been intended as a central square. As a result, the obelisk in memory of the Bavarian troops who had died fighting with Napoleon in his Russian campaign was instead erected in the Karolinenplatz in 1833. In 1862 an equestrian statue of Ludwig I was added at the mouth of the street between the Odeon and the Palais Leuchtenberg; it was designed by Ludwig von Schwanthaler and executed by Max von Widnmann.

The Odeonsplatz has traditionally been an important site of parades and public events, including funeral processions (most recently for Franz Josef Strauss in 1988), victory parades (most recently for the Bavarian troops who took part in the Franco-Prussian War of 1871), which proceeded down the Ludwigstraße to the Feldherrnhalle, with the VIP rostrum usually being located at the statue of Ludwig I. The annual parade to the Oktoberfest still follows this route.

According to many historians, this traditional function was the reason for the Nazi march on the Feldherrnhalle on 9 November 1923 in the course of the Beer Hall Putsch, which ended in a gunfight in which four state police officers and 16 Nazis were killed. During the Third Reich, the annual memorial march passed through the square and continued to the Königsplatz, where the Nazi fallen had been interred. A memorial was erected for them to the east of the Feldherrnhalle, which all passersby were required to honour with the Hitler salute; this was demolished in 1945 and the four police officers remembered with a plaque in the pavement and in 2010 with one on the wall of the Residenz.

The Odeonsplatz was also the subject of at least one painting by Hitler.

Together with the Marienplatz, the Odeonsplatz remains an important site for both civic events and demonstrations.

Tourist attractions in Munich"," Odeonsplatz is a large square in the German city of Munich, the capital of Bavaria. It is located in the eastern part of the city centre, just north of the Altstadt and a few blocks east of Marienplatz. The square was created in 1836 following the demolition of the OTC MONACO building, which had occupied the site since 1737. The square was named after the demolished building, which in turn had been named after the Eight Wonder of the World, the Parthenon in Athens. In the centre of the square stands the Loggia, or Festsaalbau, a huge covered hall with a row of columns in front. The loggia, designed by architect Friedrich von Gärtner, was built between 1841 and 1844. It was originally intended as a shelter for the wet and the cold, as the citizens of Munich used to gather here every year for the traditional Dult, a festival which later developed into the present-day Oktoberfest. The loggia is one of the few historic buildings in Munich that has not been damaged during the Second World War. In the south of the square stands the Old Town Hall or Altes Rathaus. The structure, which is actually a tower, is a remaining part of the original medieval city walls of Munich and was integrated into the new building in the 19th century. The tower is home to the city's oldest bell, the figure of a crier called ""Münchner Gabenherd"" (the Munich Beggar). The tower is integrated into the rear of the building of the former Munich Police Department, or Polizeipräsidium, a massive structure that also occupies the eastern part of the square. The police department building was heavily damaged by the bombs of the Second World War and was rebuilt in a simplified form after the war. In the centre of the square, opposite the Loggia, is a large equestrian statue of the Bavarian King Louis I (1786–1868). The statue was created by Alexander Schneider and was erected on the square in 1875. In the northern part of the square stands the Feldherrenhalle, a curved, colonnaded building originally constructed in the 1930s and rebuilt in the 1950s. The building is decorated with four statues by the German sculptor Arno Breker. The square was completely redesigned in the 1960s, with the construction of the new underground railway lines. A pedestrian underpass now leads to the Karstadt department store and the Neuhauser Strasse.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,20849935,0.06148282097649187,0.16842105263157894,0.23627973826544124,0.37850467289719625,6,4,0,0,2,1,1,0,0,1,0.2488309470675725,0.020106284268722123,0.0064899199116266225,0.022113022113022112,4,0,10,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,6,1,14,1,1,1

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Baddiel and Skinner Unplanned"", the article should at least have 250 words","Baddiel and Skinner Unplanned is a British free-form television talk show hosted by comedians David Baddiel and Frank Skinner and produced by Avalon Television for ITV. It ran from 2000 to 2005. Its concept was developed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe prior to the television series. Alongside the television series, the show had a run in the West End at the Shaftesbury Theatre between 17 April and 12 May 2001 from which a ‘Baddiel and Skinner Unplanned - Live in the West End’ DVD was released.

Format

The intro to the show begins with a slow pan along an empty street before focussing on actor Lewis Rose who sings the intro before the crowds come in to join with a chant of ""It'll never work"" and head into the theatre to watch the show. Baddiel and Skinner eventually join in with the crowds and enter themselves, singing ""And neither will we again!""

The show features the two hosts sitting on a couch on-stage and responding to questions from the audience – at times rather seriously, but usually with bizarre digressions into satirical comedy. An audience member is chosen as ""Secretary"" and has the job of keeping a note of the topics covered on a white board. In practice, the personality of the secretary will also prompt many jokes – usually at his or her expense. At the end of the show, Skinner asks either the secretary or the audience to choose between two song books, and to pick a page number between 1 and 20. This process determines which song is performed by the duo, sung by Skinner with Baddiel accompanying him on piano (or, on at least one occasion, semi-acoustic guitar).

Topics of discussion are wholly mandated by the audience and have ranged from discussions of the war against Iraq and other political events to comments on the latest plot twists of popular soap operas and the Atkins diet. Skinner's Catholicism and Baddiel's Jewish culture are also occasional targets of humour (Baddiel describing Skinner's faith as being ""insane"" and Skinner often using a music-hall Jewish accent to hold mock dialogues among members of Baddiel's extended family, as well as both performers demonstrating how to ""play the piano in a convincingly Jewish manner"").

To avoid it becoming too similar to the pair's other show, Fantasy Football League, an unofficial rule was introduced to prevent discussion of football-related topics.

It was presented by David Baddiel and his friend and flatmate Frank Skinner, both of whom were at the time best known for their work on the BBC's top-rated alternative comedy show, Fantasy Football League. The show was filmed in a similar documentary style to the earlier show, and was originally broadcast on BBC Choice, the BBC's then-new digital television channel, in 1998. It was shown on BBC One the following year. Unplanned was recorded in a similar fashion to the earlier show, with Baddiel and Skinner ad-libbing in front of a live studio audience, with some material written beforehand. Many of the sketches were based on contemporary news stories. The show also featured some of the pair's excursions, such as a trip to Las Vegas, and a journey across the Sahara Desert. The series ran for two series, with the second series featuring a live episode, and an episode where each of the pair was sent to a different country (Baddiel in South Africa, and Skinner in Israel).

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Vulcano"", the article should at least have 250 words","Vulcano () or Vulcan is a small volcanic island  belonging to Italy in the Tyrrhenian Sea, about  north of Sicily and located at the southernmost end of the seven Aeolian Islands. The island is  in area, rises to  above sea level, and it contains several volcanic calderas, including one of the four active volcanoes in Italy that are not submarine.

The word ""volcano"", and its equivalent in several European languages, derives from the name of this island, which derives from the Roman belief that the tiny island was the chimney of  Vulcan, the Roman god of fire. In November 2021, 150 people were evacuated from the island's harbour area due to increased volcanic activity and gases; an amber alert had been issued in October 2021 after several significant changes in the volcano's parameters.

History 

The Romans used the island mainly for raw materials, harvesting timber, and mining alum and sulfur. These were the principal activities on the island until the end of the nineteenth century.

After Bourbon rule collapsed in 1860, the Scottish industrialist and philanthropist James Stevenson bought the northern part of the island. He then built a villa, reopened the local mines, and planted vineyards for making Malmsey wine. Stevenson lived on Vulcano until the last major eruption on the island, in 1888. This eruption lasted the better part of two years, by which time Stevenson had sold all of his property to the local populace. He never returned to the island. His villa is still intact.

Geology

Volcanic activity in the region is largely the result of tectonic activity,  the northward-moving African plate meeting the Eurasian plate. There are three volcanic centres on the island:

 At the southern end of the island are old stratovolcano cones, Monte Aria (), Monte Saraceno (), and Monte Luccia (), which have partially collapsed into the Il Piano Caldera.
 The most recently active centre is the Gran Cratere at the top of the Fossa cone, the cone having grown in the Lentia Caldera in the middle of the island, and has had at least nine major eruptions in the last 6,000 years.
 At the north of the island is the islet, Vulcanello (), connected to Vulcano by an isthmus that may be flooded in bad weather. It emerged from the sea during an eruption in 183 BCE, as a separate islet. Occasional eruptions from its three cones with both pyroclastic flow deposits and lavas occurred from then until 1550, with the last eruption creating a narrow isthmus connecting it to Vulcano.

Vulcano has been quiet since the eruption of the Fossa cone on 2 August 1888 to 22 March 1890, which deposited about  of pyroclastic material on the summit. The style of eruption seen on the Fossa cone is called a Vulcanian eruption, being the explosive emission of pyroclastic fragments of viscous magmas caused by the high viscosity preventing gases from escaping easily. This eruption of Vulcano was carefully documented at the time by Giuseppe Mercalli. Mercalli described the eruptions as ""...explosions sounding like a cannon at irregular intervals..."" As a result, vulcanian eruptions are based on his description. A typical vulcanian eruption can hurl blocks of solid material several hundreds of metres from the vent. Mercalli reported that blocks from the 1888–1890 eruption fell into the sea between Vulcano and neighboring Lipari, and several that had fallen on the island of Vulcano were photographed by him or his assistants.
 
Volcanic gas emissions from this volcano are measured by a multicomponent gas analyzer system, which detects degassing of rising magmas before an eruption, improving prediction of volcanic activity.

A survey on local groundwater from 1995 to 1997 found temperatures of 49–75 °C, sodium sulfate-chloride chemical composition, and near neutral pH in the water wells closest to the slopes of the volcanic cone. This is mainly due to condensation onto the slopes of the volcanic cone and water-rock interaction buffering.

Population
At the 2011 Census, Vulcano had a population of 953 residents, living in three localities – Vulcano Porto, Vulcano Piano and Vulcanello.

Biology
Since Vulcano island has volcanic activity, it is a place where thermophiles and hyperthermophiles are likely to be found. In fact, the hyperthermophilic archaean Pyrococcus furiosus was described for the first time when it was isolated from sediments of this island by Gerhard Fiala and Karl Stetter.

Mythology 
The Ancient Greeks named this island Therasía (Θηρασία) and Thérmessa (Θέρμεσσα, source of heat). The island appeared in their myths as the private foundry of the Olympian god Hephaestus, the patron of blacksmiths. Their myths noted two more of his foundries, at Etna and Olympus. Strabo also mentions Thermessa as sacred place of Hephaestus (ἱερὰ Ἡφαίστου), but it is not certain whether this was a third name for the island, or merely an adjective.

Similarly, the Romans believed that Vulcano was the chimney of their god Vulcan's workshop and, therefore, named the island after him. According to the Roman myths, the island had grown due to his periodic clearing of cinders and ashes from his forge. They also explained earthquakes that either preceded or accompanied the explosions of ash as being due to Vulcan making weapons for their god Mars for his armies to wage war.

First historical ascent and reception in medieval literature
The first ascent of the volcanic cone is documented for the 13th century. The Dominican monk Burchard of Mount Sion, in his pilgrimage report to the Holy Land, tells of his return journey via Sicily, which probably took place in 1284. On Vulcano he had climbed the summit ""crawling on his hands and feet"". His ascent can be considered authentic, as he reports in detail on his observations of the landscape and nature, for example describing the fumaroles or the diameter of the crater.

The island of Vulcano as well as the Aeolian Islands are already known to Isidor of Seville, the Gallic bishop Arculf, who dictated his journey to the Holy Land to the Irishman Adomnan (before 680), or Bartholomew Anglicus. They are an integral part of medieval knowledge of the geography of the Mediterranean, but none of them wrote about Vulcano on their own initiative.

Vulcano is also mentioned in the pilgrimage report (ca. 1350) by Ludolf von Sudheim, who, however, claims that he did not dare to climb it. Unlike Burchard of Mount Sion, Ludolf expected to find the entrance to hell at the crater. The Provençal knight Antoine de La Sale tells of an excursion to the island in 1406. His text is a didactic textbook for his pupil John of Calabria, the son of Duke Rene I of Anjou.

Appearances in contemporary culture
The film Vulcano (released in the U.S. as Volcano) was filmed on Vulcano and the nearby island of Salina between 1949 and 1950.

An asteroid is named for this island, 4464 Vulcano.

The island of Vulcano is featured in the Battle Tendency story arc of the manga JoJo's Bizarre Adventure by Hirohiko Araki, as the scene of the final clash between the protagonist Joseph Joestar and the antagonist Kars, leader of the Pillar Men.

The American attorney and writer, Richard Paul Roe, asserts that the play The Tempest by William Shakespeare is set on the island of Vulcano, rather than the more authoritative interpretation that the setting was based on reports about Bermuda in the Americas and a hurricane encountered there.

The island is referred to by a hologram of Leonardo da Vinci in the Star Trek: Voyager episode ""Concerning Flight"" while speaking to Tuvok, an alien from a planet named Vulcan.

Vulcanian eruptions"," Vulcano (Vulcan in English) is the name of a figure from Greek mythology who was the Roman god of fire. His name may be related to that of the island of Vulcano in the Aeolian Islands, one of the Lipari Islands off the northeast coast of Sicily, Italy, which is still active and is the location of the main crater of the Aeolian volcano. Vulcan was the son of the god Cronus and the mortal woman Rhea. He had three brothers and three sisters, and was the brother of Ceres, Vesta, Neptune, Pluto, Proserpine, and Fortune. When he was born, his father Cronus, who had learned that one of his children was fated to dethrone him, swallowed his children as soon as they were born. But Rhea did not want this to happen to her last-born child, Vulcan, and substituted a large stone wrapped in swaddling clothes for Cronus to swallow. The real Vulcan was hidden in a cave on the island of Vulcano by his mother. According to a different tradition, the young child was placed in an iron box which his mother then threw into the sea. He was rescued by a fish that lived in the sea around the island of Vulcano, a fish that was later caught by a fisherman, and the child was then raised by the fisherman and his wife. As an adult, Vulcan became a metalsmith and worked at his forge. He was the first to discover how to extract metal from rocks, and he invented the hammer and anvil. He made many useful implements, including weapons, tools, and household items. He was also a sculptor and created many beautiful works of art. In some traditions, Vulcan was said to have created the first wife of each of his brothers. For example, he created the first woman for the god Mars, and she was named Salacia. He also created the first woman for the god Neptune, and she was named Venilia. And he created the first woman for the god Pluto, and she was named Proserpina. Vulcan is often shown as a bearded man with a hammer, anvil, and tongs. He is also sometimes shown as a man with a hammer and anvil, and with a bird (usually a cockerel) on his shoulder. The Romans celebrated the festival of Vulcania on August 23. The festival was held in honor of the god Vulcan, and it included a sacrifice to him. The sacrifice was performed on a mountaintop, and the meat from the sacrifice was then boiled in a large pot called a Volcanus. The festival also included a race in which the competitors carried red-hot stones in iron baskets. The winner of the race was the competitor who carried the hottest stone. The goddess Vesta was also honored during the festival of Vulcania. Vesta was the goddess of the hearth, and she was said to preside over the family and home. Her symbol was a burning candle, and her temple was located in the Forum in Rome. The island of Vulcano in the Aeolian Islands was said to be the home of the god Vulcan. The island is still active, and the main crater of the Aeolian volcano is located there. The island was first settled by the ancient Greeks, and it has been a popular tourist destination for many years.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,81254,0.06148282097649187,0.28421052631578947,0.18665607625099284,0.6230529595015576,6,3,1,0,3,1,1,0,0,0,0.12310456625384684,0.023739189970258492,0.0030378348522507597,0.03562653562653563,9,0,11,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,12,1,26,1,1,1
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Accumulated cyclone energy"", the article should at least have 250 words","Accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) is a metric used by various agencies to express the energy used by a tropical cyclone during its lifetime. The calculation takes a tropical cyclone's maximum sustained winds every six hours and multiplies it by itself to generate the values. These values are then added together which become a total for a storm and can either be divided by 10,000 to make them more manageable or added to other totals in order to work out a total for a particular group of storms. The calculation was originally created by William Gray and his associates at Colorado State University as the Hurricane Destruction Potential index, which took each hurricane's maximum sustained winds above  and multiplied it by itself every six hours. This index was subsequently tweaked by the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in 2000 to include all tropical cyclones, with winds above  and renamed accumulated cyclone energy. The index has since been used by various other agencies to calculate a storm's accumulated cyclone energy, including the Australian Bureau of Meteorology as well as the India Meteorological Department.

The highest ACE calculated for a single storm is 82, for Hurricane/Typhoon Ioke in 2006.

History
The accumulated cyclone energy index was originally created by William Gray and his associates at Colorado State University, as the Hurricane Destruction Potential index (HDP). They argued that the destruction of a hurricanes wind and storm surge was better related, to the square of the storms maximum winds (Vmax2) than to the storms maximum winds. The index was calculated by squaring the estimated maximum sustained wind speed by themselves, for all tropical cyclones with windspeeds of above  every six hours over the entire season. This scale was subsequently tweaked by the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to include all tropical cyclones, with winds above  who also renamed it the accumulated cyclone energy index. Since the scale was tweaked by NOAA, the storm totals have been used in a number of different ways, by various agencies and researchers, including the Australian Bureau of Meteorology and the India Meteorological Department. These purposes include to categorise how active a tropical cyclone season was as well as to identify possible long-term trends in a certain area such as the Lesser Antiles.

Calculation
The accumulated cyclone energy of a season is calculated by summing the squares of the estimated maximum sustained velocity of every tropical cyclone that has wind speeds of  or higher, at six-hour intervals. The numbers are usually divided by 10,000 to make them more manageable.  One unit of ACE equals  and for use as an index the unit is assumed.  Thus:

 

where vmax is estimated sustained wind speed in knots.

Kinetic energy is proportional to the square of velocity, and by adding together the energy per some interval of time, the accumulated energy is found. As the duration of a storm increases, more values are summed and the ACE also increases such that longer-duration storms may accumulate a larger ACE than more-powerful storms of lesser duration. Although ACE is a value roughly proportional to the definite integral over time of the kinetic energy of the system, it is not a direct calculation of energy (the mass of the moved air and therefore the size of the storm would show up in a real energy calculation).

Atlantic Ocean

Within the Atlantic Ocean, the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and others use the ACE index of a season to classify the season into one of four categories. These four categories are extremely active, above-normal, near-normal, and below-normal, and are worked out using an approximate quartile partitioning of seasons based on the ACE index over the 70 years between 1951 and 2020. The median value of the ACE index from 1951 to 2020 is 96.7 x 104 kt2.

Individual storms in the Atlantic
The highest ever ACE estimated for a single storm in the Atlantic is 73.6, for the San Ciriaco hurricane in 1899, likely because it was a Category 4 hurricane which lasted for 4 weeks. This single storm had an ACE higher than many whole Atlantic storm seasons. Other Atlantic storms with high ACEs include Hurricane Ivan in 2004, with an ACE of 70.4, Hurricane Irma in 2017, with an ACE of 64.9, the Great Charleston Hurricane in 1893, with an ACE of 63.5, Hurricane Isabel in 2003, with an ACE of 63.3, and the 1932 Cuba hurricane, with an ACE of 59.8.

Since 1950, the highest ACE of a tropical storm was Tropical Storm Laura in 1971, which attained an ACE of 8.6. The highest ACE of a Category 1 hurricane was Hurricane Nadine in 2012, which attained an ACE of 26.3. The lowest ACE of a tropical storm were tropical storms Chris (2000) and Philippe (2017), both of which were tropical storms for only six hours and had an ACE of just 0.1. The lowest ACE of any hurricane was 2005's Hurricane Cindy, which was only a hurricane for six hours, and 2007's Hurricane Lorenzo, which was a hurricane for twelve hours; Cindy had an ACE of just  1.5175 and Lorenzo had a lower ACE of only 1.475. The lowest ACE of a major hurricane (Category 3 or higher), was Hurricane Gerda in 1969, with an ACE of 5.3.
The following table shows those storms in the Atlantic basin from 1950–2021 that have attained over 50 points of ACE.

Historical ACE in recorded Atlantic hurricane history
There is an undercount bias of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes before the satellite era (prior to the mid–1960s), due to the difficulty in identifying storms.

Classification criteria

Eastern Pacific

Within the Eastern Pacific Ocean, the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and others use the ACE index of a season to classify the season into one of three categories. These three categories are above-, near-, and below-normal and are worked out using an approximate tercile partitioning of seasons based on the ACE index and the number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes over the 30 years between 1991 and 2020.

For a season to be defined as above-normal, the ACE index criterion and two or more of the other criteria given in the table below must be satisfied.

The mean value of the ACE index from 1991 to 2020 is 108.7 x 104 kt2, while the median value is 97.2 x 104 kt2.

Individual storms in the Pacific
The highest ever ACE estimated for a single storm in the Eastern or Central Pacific, while located east of the International Date Line is 62.8, for Hurricane Fico of 1978. Other Eastern Pacific storms with high ACEs include Hurricane John in 1994, with an ACE of 54.0, Hurricane Kevin in 1991, with an ACE of 52.1, and Hurricane Hector of 2018, with an ACE of 50.5.

The following table shows those storms in the Eastern and Central Pacific basins from 1971–2018 that have attained over 30 points of ACE.

 – Indicates that the storm formed in the Eastern/Central Pacific, but crossed 180°W at least once; therefore, only the ACE and number of days spent in the Eastern/Central Pacific are included.

Historical ACE in recorded Pacific hurricane history
Data on ACE is considered reliable starting with the 1971 season.

Classification criteria

North Indian

There are various agencies over the North Indian Ocean that monitor and forecast tropical cyclones, including the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center, as well as the Bangladesh, Pakistan and India Meteorological Department. As a result, the track and intensity of tropical cyclones differ from each other, and as a result, the accumulated cyclone energy also varies over the region. However, the India Meteorological Department has been designated as the official Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre by the WMO for the region and has worked out the ACE for all cyclonic systems above  based on their best track analysis which goes back to 1982.

Tropical cyclone meteorology"," Accumulated cyclone energy The Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) index is an indicator of the collective destructive power of storms that occurred over a region during a particular period of time. The index value is calculated by squaring the wind speed of each storm, multiplying by the storm's duration, and then summing these values. The ACE index does not represent the damage that might have been caused by the storms, but instead provides a means of comparing the destructive potential of different sets of storms. The index was first developed in 1987 by Kerry Emanuel of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to provide a single value that could be used to compare the destructive potential of multiple storms that occurred over a region during a single season. The index has since been used to compare the destructive potential of storms in different regions and at different times. The ACE index is typically calculated for the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The index can also be calculated for other regions, such as the Indian Ocean, but in these cases the storms that are included in the index may not be true tropical cyclones. The ACE index is used by meteorologists to provide a simple and consistent measure of the destructive potential of tropical cyclones. It is also used by researchers to study the physical processes that occur within tropical cyclones and to improve the computer models that are used to predict the tracks and intensity of these storms. The ACE index is not without its limitations, however. The index is only calculated for regions where sufficient wind speed data are available. In addition, the index does not take into account the size of the storm, the amount of rainfall that it produced, or the extent of the storm's circulation. These factors can all have a significant impact on the destructive potential of a tropical cyclone.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,1201310,0.047140986468790926,0.10526315789473684,0.18884719673523045,0.24922118380062305,6,6,1,0,3,1,0,0,0,1,0.13637361256525674,0.02948466749111825,0.005247169290251312,0.02457002457002457,11,0,18,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,15,1,27,1,1,1

Final league tables

The tables below are reproduced here in the exact form that they can be found at The Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation website and in Rothmans Book of Football League Records 1888–89 to 1978–79, with home and away statistics separated.

Beginning with the season 1894–95, clubs finishing level on points were separated according to goal average (goals scored divided by goals conceded), or more properly put, goal ratio. In case one or more teams had the same goal difference, this system favoured those teams who had scored fewer goals. The goal average system was eventually scrapped beginning with the 1976–77 season.

During the first five seasons of the league, that is until the season, 1893–94, re-election process concerned the clubs which finished in the bottom four of the league. From the 1894–95 season and until the 1920–21 season the re-election process was required of the clubs which finished in the bottom three of the league.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""The Daily Show: Indecision 2006"", the article should at least have 250 words","The Daily Show with Jon Stewart's Indecision 2006 was Stewart's coverage of the 2006 general elections. It extended for most of the campaign period for that election, but grew especially intensive toward the actual date of the election on November 7. It marked the first appearance of John Oliver on the show.

In particular, the Indecision 2006 coverage extended to the Midwest Midterm Midtacular, which was a special of The Daily Show that aired from October 30, 2006 through November 2, 2006. It was filmed in Columbus, Ohio at Roy Bowen Theater on the campus of Ohio State University.

The Midtacular chose to film in Ohio due to that state's highly contested and critical role in the outcomes of both the midterm elections held on November 7, 2006 and in the 2004 Presidential election (another possible reason is that Ohio is located in the Midwest/middle of the United States, in keeping with the ""middle"" centric theme). Featured candidates from Ohio were the successful Ohio Governor's election candidate Ted Strickland and opponent Ken Blackwell and successful Democratic Ohio Senate election candidate Sherrod Brown who went on to defeat incumbent Republican Mike DeWine.

It was the fifth time that The Daily Show traveled outside New York City for its Indecision campaign. Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Washington, DC, and Boston (for the 2004 Democratic National Convention) have also been featured.

First episode
The first episode of the special was covered from various Applebee's restaurants in Youngstown, Cincinnati, and Shaker Heights as well as a Bob Evans restaurant in Chillicothe. In addition, Samantha Bee covered a segment from Columbus—filming at the Ohio Statehouse and the Columbus Hooter's. The first guest on the special was Cleveland Cavaliers star LeBron James.

The crowd showed strong vocal support for successful Democratic candidates Brown and Strickland. They booed at footage where Blackwell suggested Strickland had been a member of the North American Man/Boy Love Association and cheered when LeBron James claimed he would have attended Ohio State University had he not been able to enter the NBA at 18.

Second episode
The second episode featured specials on voting changes made by Ken Blackwell that restricted voting by minorities in 2004. It was said that, ""this was the first time a black man was able to disenfranchise someone in this country."" It also featured the tight races in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Montana, and Tennessee. Also, the political commercials that have been featured across the nation were parodied. Stewart's guest was The Ohio State University political science professor John Mueller who wrote the book Overblown.

Midterm Midtacular Election Day Special
The Midtacular culminated in a live, hour-long episode on the night of Election Day, November 7, 2006. The episode was a joint venture with The Colbert Report and its host, former Daily Show correspondent Stephen Colbert. Former CBS news anchor Dan Rather also joined as a special correspondent. Guests included Robert Wexler and Eleanor Holmes Norton.

The show, which was the third and final edition of the series to run over multiple nights, was a wrap-up to the 2006 midterm elections, which were held on November 7. The show was the first multi-night edition since the series' earliest days, when it was known as The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and was primarily a satirical news-based talk show, rather than the hybrid news/comedy show it has since become. The show was broken up into multiple segments, including ""Indecision 2006,"" a live half-hour election night show on November 7; ""Midnight Indecision,"" a live hour-long show that immediately followed Indecision 2006 on November 7; ""Indecision: Now What?,"" a live show on November 8; and ""Indecision 2006: The Hangover,"" a live show on November 9. The November 9 show was the only one of the four that was not live. The Daily Show was the first network late-night show to broadcast live on election night, and this edition of the series received a few technical patents for the electronic voting map used to illustrate the election returns. On the November 7 Indecision 2006 show, the correspondents used the ""Magic Wall"" to explain the election returns. The wall was made up of a large number of small, square, red and blue lights, each of which represented a single voting district. The colors of the lights were initially all blue, signifying that no votes had yet been cast. As the night went on and the votes were counted, the lights changed to red or blue to represent which party had won each district. The magic wall was updated in real time, with the updated results displayed as they came in. The wall was designed by Alex Pollack. The November 7 show also featured a special video introduction by Jon Stewart, who, in character as the show's anchor, explained that the show was going to be different that night, because it was ""live."" In addition to the special video and graphics, the show's theme music was also changed for the night. Instead of the usual fast-paced theme, the show used a slower, more suspenseful version of the theme, designed to heighten the suspense of the election returns. In the course of the evening, the show also used a number of guest commentators, including political analyst Nancy Walls, comedian and actress Kathy Griffin, and Daily Show correspondents Rob Riggle, Stephen Colbert, and Samantha Bee. At the end of the November 7 show, Jon Stewart anchored the ""Tales from the Trump Club"" segment, which featured a number of jokes at the expense of Republican candidate Donald Trump, who had already announced that he would be running for president in 2008. The November 7 show was watched by an average of 1.3 million viewers, making it the most-watched episode of The Daily Show since the show's inception in 1996. The show also received a 3.2 rating/5 share in the key 18-49 demographic, which was the highest rating in the show's history.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,7706223,0.06904487917146147,0.16842105263157894,0.19281777264303077,0.5763239875389408,2,1,1,0,5,0,1,1,1,1,0.25622254079581747,0.0458925646442242,0.004556752278376139,0.06511056511056511,2,1,4,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,9,1,11,1,0,1

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""The Survivor (Star Trek: The Animated Series)"", the article should at least have 250 words","""The Survivor"" is the sixth episode of the first season of the American animated science fiction television series Star Trek: The Animated Series. It first aired on NBC on October 13, 1973, and was written by James Schmerer and was directed by Hal Sutherland. Schmerer pitched an idea for an episode to producer D.C. Fontana called ""The Chameleon"", and together with the series creator Gene Roddenberry, it was developed into the final script.

Set in the 23rd century, the series follows the adventures of Captain James T. Kirk (voiced by William Shatner) and the crew of the Starfleet starship Enterprise. In this episode, the crew rescue a shapeshifting alien called the Vendorian from a damaged spacecraft who has disguised himself as a missing philanthropist. Once on board the vessel, he transforms himself into Captain Kirk and tries to take the ship into a Romulan trap, while the real Captain Kirk is tied up. But after falling in love with Lieutenant Anne Nored (voiced by Nichelle Nichols), the Vendorian saves the Enterprise and Kirk agrees to take his actions into account.

Schmerer and Roddenberry disagreed over some of the changes to the script, as the writer wanted to avoid repeating things that had previously been seen in Star Trek: The Original Series. Critics felt that the episode was similar to those of The Original Series, but it was considered one of the best episodes seen in The Animated Series by Chris Cummins of the website Topless Robot. ""The Survivor"" was adapted into a novelization by Alan Dean Foster and was released on several different home media formats.

Plot 
While patrolling near the Romulan Neutral Zone, the Federation starship Enterprise finds a small private ship flown by a Vendorian, an alien species that can transform its shape at will. The alien dupes the Enterprise crew by assuming the form of Carter Winston, a Federation citizen and philanthropist who has been missing for five years. Winston's fiancee, Lieutenant Anne Nored, happens to serve as a security officer aboard the Enterprise; upon their reunion, he breaks off their engagement without explanation.

The Vendorian renders Captain James T. Kirk unconscious, takes his form and orders the helmsman, Lt. Hikaru Sulu to steer the Enterprise into the Neutral Zone, where Romulan warbirds lie in wait. The real Kirk regains consciousness, however, he is bound and gagged. Meanwhile, Dr. McCoy and Spock become suspicious when ""Dr. McCoy"" allows that he might have made a mistake - something the real McCoy would never admit to - and a new examination table materializes in the medical bay. They force the Vendorian to reveal his true form, and the alert is sounded. The Vendorian escapes detection and disables the Enterprises deflector shields, leaving it vulnerable to Romulan attack, while its presence in the Neutral Zone gives the Romulans a pretext to destroy the Enterprise. Ursula hears Kirk rummaging around; she releases him. He then explains that the Vendorian was in league with the Romulans from the beginning.

The Vendorian takes the form of a deflector shield around the Enterprise and the Romulans retreat. The Vendorian shows himself to the Enterprise crew, and explains that the nature of his kind is to gradually assume the memories and personal traits of those they impersonate. Because he spent too much time in the form of Carter Winston, he became unwilling to let the Enterprise crew be killed. He is arrested and will face trial, but Kirk tells him that his actions to protect the Enterprise will be taken into consideration. Nored volunteers to guard the Vendorian, saying that he has become similar enough to Winston that she has feelings of love for him.

Production 
""The Survivor"" is writer James Schmerer's only credit in the Star Trek franchise, whose other genre work consisted of two episodes of the television series Wonder Woman as well as a single episode of Buck Rodgers. He was better known for his work on soap operas such as General Hospital and Another World. He pitched stories for Star Trek: The Animated Series on the basis that the show targeted an adult audience similar to Star Trek: The Original Series and not children. He knew it was going to be broadcast on Saturday mornings, but would be unhampered by restrictions on live-action television. He later said ""that was one of the reasons why I took it, because I'm not an animated writer... I had written a couple of animated shows through the years, and it was like pulling teeth."" He explained that he wrote the script for ""The Survivor"" as if it was a live-action story; it was originally known as ""The Chameleon"". The title was eventually changed in order to preserve the plot point as a surprise for the viewer.

He had known producer D.C. Fontana for several years, and pitched his story directly to her. In turn, she relayed it to the franchise creator Gene Roddenberry, who called Schmerer back for a meeting. Together they re-wrote the story during the meeting to make it fit within the 30-minute-long animated episode. Schmerer explained that Roddenberry appreciated the idea of an alien pretending to be other characters, and that The Animated Series could easily show the shapeshifter undergo the various changes in the episode. The design of the Vendorian had been described by Schmerer in the script, but was changed to the squid-like design by the animators, a change that Schmerer described as ""neat"" and ""clever"". In the original outline, the Vendorian didn't assume the role of Kirk. Added by Roddenberry, Schmerer did not agree with the change. Roddenberry and Schmerer argued about the point, with Roddenberry saying that Kirk was the star of the series while Schmerer wanted it to be different as he was concerned that its plot would appear too similar to the events of ""Whom Gods Destroy"" where Garth of Izar changes his appearance to become Kirk.

Casting 
Ted Knight did uncredited voice acting for the character Carter Winston.

Reception and home media release 
""The Survivor"" was first broadcast on NBC on October 13, 1973. Edward Gross, the senior editor of Cinescape Magazine, rates ""The Survivor"" as ""an above-average episode"" that ""definitely has the feeling of a live-action [Star Trek] show."" Marc Altman compared it to other similarly-themed episodes such as ""The Man Trap"", which featured a shape-changing alien and a lost love, and said ""the shape-changing alien is a familiar genre (and Trekkian trope), the romantic twist in which the Vendorian spy betrays his Romulan masters for love is a nice surprise.""

Michelle Erica Green, in her review for TrekNation, found that the voice work was distracting due to the similarity between William Shatner's and Ted Knight's voices; as well as having Nichelle Nichols voice a different character. She also thought that the alien looked silly, and felt that the plot had been reused from ""The Man Trap"". In 2012, Chris Cummins listed the eight best episodes of The Animated Series for website Topless Robot. He praised the writing of Schmerer, saying that the episode felt like an episode of The Original Series, and placed it as the third best episode of the series. The episode was given four out of five stars in Star Trek: The Complete Manual by SciFiNow magazine.

Alan Dean Foster expanded the episode into a novelization, adding such scenes as a Christmas party. It was released as part of Star Trek Log Two, published in September 1974. The other episodes adapted in the same work were ""The Lorelei Signal"" and ""The Infinite Vulcan"". ""The Survivor"" was released on LaserDisc as part of the series set. The first release of Star Trek: The Animated Series on DVD was through fan-made productions. The official DVD release was on November 21, 2006 in the United States, a single release containing all episodes from both seasons of the television show.

Fictional shapeshifters
Television episodes directed by Hal Sutherland"," ""The Survivor"" is the sixteenth episode of the second season of the American animated science fiction television series Star Trek: The Animated Series, and the 40th overall. It was written by Bob Spiers and Fred Bronson and was directed by Dan Curry. It was first broadcast on NBC on October 30, 1974. Set in the 23rd century, the series follows the adventures of Captain James T. Kirk and the crew of the starship Enterprise as they explore the universe. In this episode, the Enterprise comes across a damaged alien vessel with only one surviving crew member, Sargon. The crew is suspicious of Sargon and the damage to his ship, and determine that he and his crew had been conducting nuclear weapons research. As a result, they are hesitant to provide assistance, especially after Sargon warns them of the danger of their own nuclear weapons research. The episode was well received by critics, and is considered one of the best episodes of the series. It was noted for its allegorical take on the then-current nuclear arms race, and for its exploration of the ethical questions surrounding it. The episode was also noted for its dramatic ending, in which Sargon sacrifices himself to save the Enterprise crew from a nuclear explosion. This episode was the first of the series to be produced after the original Star Trek series was canceled. As a result, the episode featured several references to the original series, including the character Sargon, who had previously appeared in the episode ""The Return of the Archons"". The episode also featured the return of William Shatner as Captain Kirk, who had been the main character of the original series. This was the first time that a character from the original series had appeared in the animated series, and it was the first time that Shatner had played Kirk since the original series was canceled.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,3514612,0.13104988830975428,0.11578947368421053,0.3269479356476507,0.24143302180685358,2,5,0,0,4,0,1,1,0,0,0.21930098539844994,0.019042171006657928,0.004418668876001105,0.014742014742014743,4,0,10,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,1,17,1,1,1
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Troubadour style"", the article should at least have 250 words","Taking its name from medieval troubadours, the Troubadour Style () is a rather derisive term, in English usually applied to French historical painting of the early 19th century with idealised depictions of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.  In French it also refers to the equivalent architectural styles. It can be seen as an aspect of Romanticism and a reaction against Neoclassicism, which was coming to an end at the end of the Consulate, and became particularly associated with Josephine Bonaparte and Caroline Ferdinande Louise, duchesse de Berry.  In architecture the style was an exuberant French equivalent to the Gothic Revival of the Germanic and Anglophone countries.  The style related to contemporary developments in French literature, and music, but the term is usually restricted to painting and architecture.

History

The rediscovery of medieval civilization was one of the intellectual curiosities of the beginning of the 19th century, with much input from the Ancien Régime and its institutions, rites (the coronation ceremony dated back to the 16th century) and the medieval churches in which family ceremonies occurred.

Even while exhuming the remains of the kings and putting on the market a multitude of objects, works of art and elements of medieval architecture, the revolutionaries brought them back to life, it could be said.  The Musée des Monuments français (Museum of French Monuments), established in the former convent that would become Paris's École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts, presented all this glorious debris of the Middle Ages as subjects of admiration for the public and as models of inspiration for students of the departments of engraving, painting and sculpture, but not those of architecture since teaching of this subject had been dissociated from the ""beaux-arts"" and placed in the École centrale des travaux publics under the direction of J.N.L Durand, a harsh promoter of the neoclassical architecture that characterized the styles of the Convention and Consulate.  Later, from the Bourbon Restoration and under the impulse of Quatremère de Quincy and Mérimée, a new tradition of teaching architecture put it back under the fine arts umbrella, in the margins of the declining official school, beginning with private workshops that behaved as diocesan architects working for historic monuments that would give rise to the Société Centrale des Architectes and make Troubador-style architecture possible.

The resurgence of Christian feeling and in Christianity in the arts, with the publication in 1800 of Le Génie du Christianisme ('the Genius of Christianity'), played a major role in favour of edifying painting, sculpture and literature, often inspired by religion.

Artists and writers rejected the neo-antique rationalism of the French Revolution and turned towards a perceived glorious Christian past.  The progress of the history and archaeology in the course of the 18th century began to bear fruit, at first, in painting.  Paradoxically these painters of the past were unaware of the primitives of French painting, finding it too academic and not sufficiently filled with anecdote.

Napoleon himself did not disdain this artistic current: he took as his emblem the golden beehive on the grave of the Merovingian king Childeric I, rediscovered in the 17th century, and saw himself as the heir of the French monarchy.  He also gave official recognition to the Middle Ages in the forms of his coronation, and tried to profit from other trappings of the medieval French kings, perhaps even their miraculous curative powers (Bonaparte visiting the plague-victims of Jaffa by Antoine-Jean Gros was read as a modern re-envisgaing of the thaumaturgical kings).

Literature
Public interest in the Middle Ages in literature first manifested itself in France and above all England. In France, this came with the adaptation and publication from 1778 of ancient chivalric romances by the Comte de Tressan (1707–1783) in his Bibliothèque des romans, and in England with the first fantastical romances and gothic novels, such as The Castle of Otranto (1764). These English romances inspired late 18th-century French writers to follow suit, such as Donatien de Sade with his Histoire secrete d'Isabelle de Baviere, reine de France. The Le Troubadour, poésies occitaniques (1803) by Fabre d'Olivet popularized the term, and may have led to the naming of the style in art. The Waverley Novels of Walter Scott were hugely popular across Europe, and a major influence on both painting and French novelists such as Alexandre Dumas and Victor Hugo.

Painting

In painting, the troubadour style was represented by history painting portraying edifying historical episodes, often borrowing its smoothness, its minute and illusionistic description of detail, its rendering of fabrics, the intimate character of its familiar scenes and its other technical means from Dutch Golden Age painting. The paintings were typically rather small cabinet paintings, often showing quiet intimate anecdotal moments rather than moments of high drama, though these were both depicted. As well as figures from political history, famous artists and authors of the past were often shown, especially Raphael and Dante.  Ingres' Death of Leonardo da Vinci in the arms of King Francois I of France is one of several works bringing rulers and artists together. A number of paintings by Ingres are in the style, and lesser artists such as Pierre-Henri Révoil (1776–1842) and Fleury-François Richard (1777–1852) specialized in the style. The Belgian Henri Leys painted in a more sombre version of the style much influenced by Northern Renaissance painting. Richard Parkes Bonington is better remembered for his landscapes, but also painted in the style, as did Eugène Delacroix. The peak period was brought to an end by the Revolution of 1848, and later the arrival of Realism, although the style arguably merged into late 19th-century academic painting. The transition can be seen in the work of Paul Delaroche.

Arguably the first troubadour painting was presented at the Salon of 1802, under the French Consulate.  It was a work by Fleury-Richard, Valentine of Milan weeping for the death of her husband, a subject which had come to the artist during a visit to the ""musée des monuments français"", a museum of French medieval monuments.  A tomb from this museum was included in the painting as that of the wife.  Thanks to its moving subject matter, the painting was an enormous success – seeing it, David cried ""This resembles nothing anyone else has done, it's a new effect of colour; the figure is charming and full of expression, and this green curtain thrown across this window renders the illusion complete"".  Compositions lit from the back of the scene, with the foreground in semi-darkness, became rather a trademark of the early years of the style.

Fragonard's painting of  François Premier reçu chevalier par Bayard (Francis I knighted by Bayard, Salon of 1819) has to be read not as a rediscovery of a medieval past, but as a memory of a recent monarchic tradition.

Reaction 
Reaction to this genre, as to the Pre-Raphaelites in England, has been mixed. It can be seen as overly sentimental or unrealistically nostalgic, treating its subjects in a way ""later associated with Hollywood costume dramas.  To its proponents, the archaic details were regarded as a rallying cry for a new, localized nationalism, purged of classical (or neo-classical) and Roman influence.  The small size of many of the canvases was considered a reference to Northern, primitive painting, devoid of Italian influence. To others, the small canvas sizes represent the artworks' insignificance and lack of vigor. All the brass, gilding, carving and inlaid historical detail of the headboards of the world could not redeem such objects as anything other than interior decoration.

Architecture

A fashion for medieval architecture may be seen throughout 19th century Europe, originating in England, and a blooming of the Neogothic style, but in France this remains limited to certain 'feudal' buildings in the parks surrounding châteaux.  After the Troubadour style disappeared in painting, around the time of the 1848 French Revolution, it continued (or re-emerged) in architecture, the decorative arts, literature and theatre.

Revival architectural styles
Gothic Revival architecture"," Troubadour style Troubadour style (French: Style Troubadour) is a type of poetic developed in Southern France during the 12th century, characterized by the use of octo- and decasyllabic verse (the so-called "" vers"") with eight or ten syllables per line, a caesura after the fourth or sixth syllable, and with rhymes (in the final verse) after every line. The name derives from the French wordtrouvaille, meaning ""find"", and was first applied to the poems of theTrouvères. Troubadour style is usually found in love poetry, although there are also religious and political examples. The poetry is characterized by the presence of a theme, usually expressed in the first person, in the form of a quest, in which the troubadour searches for a love interest, usually a woman, although there are also examples of men as the object of desire. The quest may be successful or not, but the poem is always written in a positive tone. The first lines of a troubadour poem are usually the most difficult, and are used to introduce the subject of the poem. The next lines are usually easier, and are used to describe the journey, and the final lines are used to describe the object of the troubadour's desire. Troubadour style was very popular in France and Italy during the 12th and 13th centuries, and was used by many poets, including theTrouvères, the Minnesänger, and the Dolce Stil Novo. Troubadour style differs from the earlier Anglo-Norman style in that it is usually octo- and decasyllabic, whereas the Anglo-Norman style is usually octo- and hendecasyllabic. It also differs from the later Petrarchan style in that it is usually not as complex or as condensed. Troubadour style is also used in Occitan, Catalan, Galician-Portuguese, and Spanish poetry. In music, a ""troubadour style"" or ""trouvère style"" is a type of song with a similar verse structure, usually with a repeating line, and with a refrain.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,9875904,0.11573236889692586,0.09473684210526316,0.3004273989182647,0.24766355140186916,15,14,0,0,12,1,1,1,0,1,0.30988836194695124,0.047648410764081675,0.00856117094725214,0.051597051597051594,13,0,18,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,18,1,28,1,1,1
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Beatfreakz"", the article should at least have 250 words","Beatfreakz (also spelled BeatFreakz) were a Dutch house group consisting of members Dennis Christopher, Dimitrie Siliakus and Mark Simmons. For a period of time, Errol Lafleur was also part of the group.

History 
The group was founded in 2000 by Dennis Christopher (born Dennis C. de Laat, Amsterdam), Dimitrie Siliakus (born 1978, The Hague) and Mark Simmons (born Mark Nieuwenhuijzen, Amsterdam).

The group's first big hit was a song making prominent use of a sample from Rockwell's hit ""Somebody's Watching Me"". Instead of using the original voice of Rockwell, aka Kenneth Gordy, they used the voice of Dennis Delano, a Dutch singer. The song peaked at #3 in the UK Singles Chart in May 2006 and peaked at #21 in the Dutch Top 100. It peaked at #28 in the Belgium UltraTop 50 and peaked at #38 in Australia. It also peaked at #41 in the German Chart. The music video was a parody of Michael Jackson's hit Thriller.

The band released the follow-up track ""Superfreak"", a Rick James remix, on 16 October 2006.

They revealed exclusively on BBC Radio 1's Chart Show on 15 October 2006, that their next project was likely to be a remix of the Ghostbusters theme tune, original from Ray Parker Jr. This track was previewed at the Matinee closing party in Ibiza on 30 September 2006.

Dimitrie Siliakus had left the group by November 2006.

Another song of theirs is released on the Put Your Hands Up! 2 compilation, a remake of Aerosmith's ""Walk This Way"".

In 2007, the group were credited in a remix of Marvin Gaye's ""Sexual Healing"" under their alias Rockefeller, as Alibi vs. Rockefeller, with a music video featuring three female dancers dressed as nurses (Lauren Ridealgh, Bayley Darling and Stephanie Fitzpatrick). It charted at #16 on the Finnish Singles Chart and at #34 on the UK Singles Chart.

The group has not had any activity under the Beatfreakz name since 2008, however the former members worked together in the years after.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""The Other Campaign"", the article should at least have 250 words","The Other Campaign () is a political program by the Zapatista Army of National Liberation for the recognition and protection of indigenous rights and autonomy in Mexico.  This program began in January 2006, and sent Subcomandante Marcos, the main spokesperson for the campaign, to travel across Mexico for several months. This tour was intended to create connections among the Zapatistas and pre-existing resistance groups throughout Mexico.

Throughout the campaign, the Zapatistas met with a diverse number of groups and organizations, such as trade union organizers, indigenous leaders, intellectuals, feminists and women's rights activists, LGBT people, advocates for human rights, students, environmental activists, fishermen, factory workers, natural disaster victims, peasants, teachers, prostitutes, and young people. Marcos said that the goal of the campaign is ""not to speak or run for office, but 'to listen to the simple and humble people who struggle'.""  This united force was conceived to fight against neoliberalism and capitalism. The Zapatistas hoped to eliminate these practices in the Mexican federal government in order to protect the livelihoods of those citizens who are exploited economically by these institutions. Based on the Sixth Declaration of the Lacandon Jungle, the Other Campaign's ultimate goal was to force the Mexican government to agree to a convention which would rewrite the national constitution to include protection of indigenous rights and autonomy and exclude elements of neoliberal capitalism.

Historical context 
The Other Campaign emerged from a 12-year-long struggle for indigenous rights, known as the Zapatista Movement or Zapatismo. This movement began on January 1, 1994 with an uprising in Chiapas, Mexico to protest the North American Free Trade Agreement and fight for the recognition and protection of rights for the indigenous people of Mexico. The movement fought opposition from the Mexican government to end such problems as financial exploitation of natives and for the recognition of racial, ethnic, and gender differences among Mexican citizens. Throughout their existence as a political force, the Zapatistas have published a series of declarations to announce the movement's objectives, in accordance with traditional peasant and indigenous revolts in 19th-century Mexico. In 1996, the Zapatistas organized a series of peace talks with the Mexican federal government, focusing initially on culture and indigenous civil rights. These negotiations led to the signing of the San Andrés Agreements, also known as the San Andrés Accords, on February 16, 1996. But in August 2001, the Mexican government defied the terms of the San Andrés Agreements when the Mexican Congress enacted constitutional reforms that had a detrimental effect on indigenous rights.

In response to this defiance, in June, 2005 the Zapatistas released the Sixth Declaration of the Lacandon Jungle (also known as La Sexta in Spanish), the most recent of the movement's declarations of objectives. The declaration outlined several goals, and announced that the Zapatistas intend to remain both a political and military force in Mexico. The declaration describes the need for a new political party, independent from the parties of the Mexican Left and all other preexisting political parties. The Sixth Declaration also encourages an international fight against neoliberalism.

To accomplish the Sixth Declaration's goal of forming a new political force, the Zapatistas invited hundreds of organizations, political activists, leaders, and average citizens to meet and discuss strategies for gaining the support of resistance groups around the country. The result of the debates and organizational progress made during these meetings was the initiative known as the Other Campaign.

Campaign
The Other Campaign began as an idea devised by the Zapatistas to travel throughout Mexico to meet other resistance groups and learn about the struggles they face in their communities and rally support against the neoliberal and capitalistic federal political system. Although this process resembles a conventional election campaign, the goal was not to elect a candidate to public office, but to create a new kind of political force that presents a different way to conduct political business during election campaigns.

The first meeting to discuss the organization, structure, and politics of the Other Campaign was held on September 16–18, 2005. Over 2,000 people participated in this two-day event. Their experience with activism ranged from none, to post-1994 Zapatismo activist experience, to activism in the 1970s. The participants had very diverse backgrounds, including union organizers, indigenous leaders, intellectuals, feminists and women's rights activists, gays, lesbians, advocates for human rights, students, environmental activists, and teachers. Urban youth collectives and nongovernmental organizations were also represented at this event. Despite this obvious diversity and the Zapatistas' 12-year long struggle for indigenous rights, the speakers at the conference rarely mentioned the necessity of equal involvement in the campaign in terms of gender, racial-ethnic group, and sexual orientation. Rather than incorporating these important issues into discussions of all aspects of the Other Campaign, they were confined to one section of the agenda, ""A Special Place for Differences"", drawing criticism from gay, lesbian, indigenous, and feminist organizations attending the event. Despite this internal criticism, the event continued its efforts to organize the campaign.

In January, 2006, the Other Campaign launched with Subcomandante Marcos, also known as Delegado Cero, traveling for several months around all 31 Mexican states. Marcos gave speeches which were attended by people as diverse as the collaborators from the campaign's first meeting, including fishermen, factory workers, natural disaster victims, peasants, teachers, gays, lesbians, prostitutes, and young people. The ultimate goal of this tour was to rally support from organizations throughout the nation in order to eradicate neoliberalism and capitalism from the political system in Mexico. The ideal achievement of this goal included pressuring the Mexican government to create a convention to rewrite the nation's constitution to protect all Mexicans from the exploitation that results from current capitalist and neoliberal practices.

In May 2014, Rafael Guillén Vicente, the individual behind the persona and nom de guerre ""Subcomandante Marcos"", announced that he was retiring that persona and stepping down from his leadership role. He stated: ""We are warriors and as such we know our role and our time. Marcos, the character is no longer necessary... His character was created and now his creators, the Zapatistas, are destroying him."" He signed this statement off with ""My name is Galeano. Rebel Subcomandante Galeano"", signalling the adoption of a new persona.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Alan Simpson (theatre director)"", the article should at least have 250 words","Alan Simpson (1921–1980) was an Irish theatre director.

Simpson was born in Dublin, Ireland, the son of Walter Simpson, a Church of Ireland clergyman. He was called up to the army in 1941. In 1945 he transferred onto the army reserve and joined the Gate Theatre, Dublin as stage manager.

Career 
In 1953 Simpson co-founded the Pike Theatre along with his wife Carolyn Swift. On November 19, 1954, Simpson staged the first ever production of The Quare Fellow by Brendan Behan, and, in 1955, he mounted the first Irish production of Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot, which went on to become one of the longest-running productions in Ireland up until that time. In 1957 he staged Tennessee Williams'  The Rose Tattoo during the first International Dublin Theatre Festival. Despite being hugely successful and receiving positive reviews from both Irish and English critics, the production sparked controversy when a member of the audience claimed to have seen a contraceptive produced during the performance. Simpson was arrested on May 21, 1957 [DIB] on a charge of producing an indecent and profane performance for gain  and was incarcerated for one night at Bridewell.  Despite the court case dragging on for the next year, Simpson was eventually discharged.  However, the costly legal proceedings had a devastating impact on Simpson both financially and personally  and eventually led to the closure of the Pike theatre in 1960. After his marriage to Swift broke down in 1961, he worked in several theatre productions in England and Scotland, after which he was hired as artistic adviser to the Abbey Theatre on a ten-month contract in 1968. Between 1969 and 1976 he directed numerous productions including The Hard life, She Stoops to Conquer, The Quare Fellow and others. He also staged in several musicals such as Jesus Christ Superstar in 1973  and Joseph and the amazing technicolor dreamcoat at the Gaiety Theatre. He later moved to the United States of America where he lectured at New York State University in 1978 and directed Androcles and the lion by George Bernard Shaw.

Simpson divorced his first wife, Carolyn Swift. He then married Irish actress, Eileen Colgan. Simpson and Colgan remained together until his death in 1980.

Place of birth missing"," Alan Simpson (theatre director) Alan Simpson (13 August 1928 – 13 February 2015) was a British theatre director, playwright, author, and educator. Simpson was born in Norwich, the son of a businessman, and was educated at Felsted School, Essex, and at Peterhouse, Cambridge, where he read History and was a member of the Footlights. In 1952 he joined the BBC as a radio producer, working on programmes including The Goon Show. He was encouraged to become a director by one of his early employers, the producer Michael Barry, who told him that he would only be given one chance to make a fool of himself. He began directing for the stage in 1958, and later that year made his professional debut with a production of Saint Joan by George Bernard Shaw at the Arts Theatre in London. Simpson's early work was mainly in the arena of comedy, and he worked with a number of writers who went on to become major figures in the British comedy scene, including John Cleese, Ronnie Barker, and Alan Ayckbourn. In 1964 he joined the National Theatre as a staff director, and remained there until 1973. His work there included the first London production of the musical Cabaret, which transferred to the West End. He also directed the play Travesties by Tom Stoppard, which was given a successful run in London before being transferred to Broadway. In 1973 Simpson joined the Royal Shakespeare Company, where he was to spend the rest of his career. He was a director there for more than twenty years, and was also an associate director, an education director, and, for six years, the artistic director of the Royal Shakespeare Theatre. His productions there included the first London production of the musical Les Misérables. He also directed a number of plays by Shakespeare, including Hamlet, Othello, The Merchant of Venice, and Pericles. Simpson's other work included a production of The Gondoliers by Gilbert and Sullivan for the English National Opera, and the film version of the musical The Magic Roundabout. He was the author of a number of books on theatre, including The Theatre of Tom Stoppard (1977) and The Making of a Drama (1984). Simpson was married to the actress Elspeth Gray, and the couple had three daughters. He died in London in 2015, aged 86.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,42387366,0.1181434599156118,0.14736842105263157,0.2586709028329362,0.35514018691588783,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0.1237928224169705,0.028917185530301263,0.0038663352665009665,0.025798525798525797,4,1,3,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,5,1,6,1,1,1
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Screen direction"", the article should at least have 250 words","In film editing, video editing and post production, screen direction is the direction that actors or objects appear to be moving on the screen from the point of view of the camera or audience. A rule of film editing and film grammar is that movement from one edited shot to another must maintain the consistency of screen direction in order to avoid audience confusion.

""Camera left"" or ""frame left"" indicates movement towards the left side of the screen, while ""camera right"" or ""frame right"" refers to movement towards the right side of the screen.  ""Foreground"" refers to the apparent space close to the camera (and thus to the audience), and ""background"" refers to the apparent space in the distance away from the camera and the audience.

As an example of screen direction in use, if an actor is shown in one shot walking from screen left to screen right and then is shown in the next shot to be moving in the opposite direction (screen right to screen left), the audience will assume that the actor has changed direction and is walking back to where he started (in the absence of obvious contextual or environmental cues).

If the shot shows him again moving from screen left to screen right (as in the first shot), the audience will assume that the actor is continuing his previous movement and extending it to apparently cover a greater distance even if that is purely a fabrication of editing.

Another example would be if two characters are shown in a medium shot, say from the waist up, looking at each other, it is generally established that one is on the left of screen and the other on the right. The one on the left looks right to the other character and vice versa. When the editor cuts to a close shot of a person, it would be disorienting if the character looked the other way. The audience would assume that the character is looking at something else.

In the coverage of the scene, it is customary in film technique to be sure that screen direction is maintained. In a close up, the environmental cues are at a minimum.  

It is the responsibility of the director, cameraman, and script supervisor on the set to maintain consistency of screen direction so that later during editing, the myriad short pieces of film can be properly assembled by the editor into a coherent film that tells the story intended.

Avant-garde, experimental, and some independent film and video productions often deliberately violate screen direction rules in order to create audience disorientation or ambiguity. However, unless it is done very skillfully, violation of screen direction can appear to the audience to be the result of filmmaker ineptitude rather than experimentation.

Cinematic techniques"," Screen direction The direction of movement of the camera or the observer is called the screen direction. Most films are shot with a single screen direction, but some, such as Citizen Kane, are shot with multiple screen directions. Screen direction is one of the basic elements of film style and is used to create a sense of space and movement. The screen direction is determined by the placement of the camera in relation to the subject. If the camera is placed to the left of the subject, the screen direction is said to be left-to-right. If the camera is placed to the right of the subject, the screen direction is said to be right-to-left. If the camera is placed behind the subject, the screen direction is said to be rear-to-front. If the camera is placed in front of the subject, the screen direction is said to be front-to-rear. There are several ways to change the screen direction. One way is to move the camera to a new position. Another way is to use a different lens, such as a wide-angle lens, to change the field of view. A third way is to use a process called ""warping,"" in which the image is distorted to change the screen direction. In some cases, the screen direction is intentionally changed to create a specific effect. For example, in the film Citizen Kane, the screen direction is changed several times to create a sense of disorientation and confusion. In other cases, the screen direction is changed to accommodate a specific shot or scene. For example, if a shot requires the camera to be placed in a certain position, the screen direction may have to be changed to make the shot work. Screen direction is an important element of film style and is used to create a sense of space and movement. It can be used to create a specific mood or atmosphere, and it can be used to direct the audience's attention to a particular area of the screen. Screen direction is often used to create a sense of depth and space, and it can be used to make a shot more dynamic and interesting.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,3337102,0.039381153305203934,0.16842105263157894,0.20877827788074016,0.3161993769470405,3,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0.10408042182339734,0.015435854562867156,0.003452085059375863,0.011056511056511056,1,1,7,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1

Hibbard and Dietrich LeBaron
Two American designers, Thomas L. Hibbard (1898-1982) and Raymond H. Dietrich had met while working for Brewster. Tiring of the corporate environment they started freelance work in their spare time and when William H Brewster discovered this he fired Dietrich. Hibbard left too. They decided to set up on their own and formed a new company and called it LeBaron after a family friend. LeBaron did not build car bodies, they sold designs.

Hibbard et Darrin

Fellow designer, Howard ""Dutch"" Darrin (1897-1982) met Tom Hibbard in 1923. Hibbard by this time had left LeBaron and the two decided to go to Paris, initially to try to sell LeBaron designs but instead decided to set up their own company and founded Hibbard & Darrin.

Over the next few years they designed innovatively styled bodies for many of Europe's most prestigious car makers but the partnership ended in 1931 when Hibbard returned to the USA to take up a position in General Motors' design department.

Fernandez et Darrin
Darrin however remained in France and formed a new company with a wealthy French banker named Fernandez calling it Fernandez and Darrin.

Darrin returned to the United States in 1937 to set up his own Darrin of Paris on Sunset Boulevard, Hollywood managing to convince prospective customers he was a Frenchman.

Howard ""Dutch"" Darrin designed cars for Kaiser and Studebaker. With Bill Tritt he designed the Kaiser Darrin sports car. For Studebaker, renamed Studebaker Packard after their merger, he designed cars that were never produced, but can be seen at the Studebaker National Museum in South Bend, Indiana. With his sons he designed some replica cars that were sold in kit form.

Coachbuilders of France"," Hibbard & Darrin was an American architectural firm that designed numerous iconic buildings, including the original San Francisco City Hall and the Veterans Administration Hospital in West Los Angeles. The firm was founded in 1908 by George W. Hibbard (1866–1938) and S. E. Darrin (1865–1930), who had both previously worked for Joseph A. Leonard, a Los Angeles-based architect. Hibbard & Darrin became known for their use of Renaissance Revival and Neoclassical styles, as well as their ability to blend various architectural styles in a single building. The firm designed numerous buildings in California, including the Downtown Los Angeles Public Library, the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, and the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Southern California. They also designed buildings in other states, such as the Nevada State Capitol in Carson City, Nevada, and the National Archives Building in Washington, D.C. Hibbard & Darrin's most famous building is probably the original San Francisco City Hall, which was completed in 1912 and became a symbol of the city's recovery from the 1906 earthquake. The building features a distinctive dome and is considered one of the city's most important landmarks. The firm's work was not limited to public buildings, however. They also designed numerous private residences, including the mansion of Phoebe Hearst, the daughter of William Randolph Hearst, and the home of John D. Rockefeller Jr. in New York City. Hibbard & Darrin were active in the field of architecture until the death of George Hibbard in 1938. The firm's work was carried on by George's son, George G.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""J.B. Nethercutt"", the article should at least have 250 words","Jack Boison Nethercutt (October 11, 1913 – December 6, 2004) was an American entrepreneur and car collector. He was the co-founder of Merle Norman Cosmetics with his aunt Merle Norman, later ascending to the positions of chairman and chief executive officer of the company. He also served as a director of the Personal Care Products Council.

Nethercutt used his wealth to assemble one of the world's greatest car collections, which would become known as the Nethercutt Collection. With his cars, he won a record 6 Best of Show titles at the pinnacle Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance and is widely considered to the greatest car competitor of all time.

Early life and education
Nethercutt was born in South Bend, Indiana, United States, to Carl and Florence Nethercutt with two other siblings. At the age of 9, his mother died and he moved to Santa Monica, California in 1923 to live with his aunt, Merle Norman and her husband Andy Norman. He attended Santa Monica High School and later enrolled to study chemistry at the California Institute of Technology. During his time in college, his aunt had created a small local cosmetics business in her home, making formulas out of her own kitchen. He dropped out of college to help her establish the business.

Merle Norman career
In 1931, Nethercutt's aunt spent $150 to open a small local cosmetics studio named Merle Norman Cosmetics in downtown Santa Monica to sell their homemade products. Norman created the products and Nethercutt peddled to dealers on his bicycle, picking up disregarded boxes from groceries for packing shipments. By 1934, the company had expanded to 94 independently owned franchises across the contiguous United States, with the majority of them being owned by women. Nethercutt later served as Vice-Chairman of Merle Norman until Norman stepped down in 1963. In 1969, Nethercutt decided to make the previously private family owned enterprise go public on the American Stock Exchange. In 1974, Nethercutt purchased all the public stock back at roughly US$10 million, roughly $55 million adjusted for inflation. Following his purchase, he would again make Merle Norman a privately owned company.

Under his tenure, Merle Norman was recognized as one of the top 10 largest American cosmetic companies by People magazine. By 1981, Nethercutt spent $5 million on Merle Norman's first nationwide advertising campaign, which had previously only used word-of-mouth marketing. The company also had begun experimentally selling in European markets, specifically Switzerland and Austria, which attained $1 million in the first year. By the end of 1981, Merle Norman as a whole made over US$130 million and had expanded to over 2,700 studios in the US and Canada. In 1993 Nethercutt stepped down as CEO but remained the chairman of the board. In 1999 he directed the refurbishment of all Merle Norman studios in North America for a universal consistent interior design, which was last updated in the late 70s. By 2004, Merle Norman had expanded to eight countries internationally and was consistently in the top 50 of Entrepreneur magazine's Franchise 500. The company had a revenue of over $100 million and he passed the company down to his son, Jack Nethercutt II.

Cosmetic committee positions 
Nethercutt served as the President of the California Cosmetics Association. He was on both the board and executive committee of the Personal Care Products Council.

Cars
In 1956, Nethercutt purchased two cars, a 1936 Duesenberg Convertible Roadster for $5,000 and a 1930 DuPont Town Car for $500, which both needed restoration. He estimated the restoration of the DuPont would take a few weeks, but ended up taking over 18 months and over $65,000. In 1958, his prolonged project to rebuild his DuPont was not in vain and he won Best of Show at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance. In 1971, Nethercutt purchased a large land lot in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Sylmar. Construction began on a personal 10 story tall building with six floors to house his vehicles and other antique collections, featuring his private penthouse on the top floor. The Nethercutt Collection was built next to a Merle Norman manufacturing plant. 

The first two stories of the tower, the Lower and Grand Salon, feature his vehicle collection of 30 cars on display. The third story features an awards room from concours competitions and collection of hood ornaments. The fourth story consists of a music room with several large antique music boxes and player pianos, with a Wurlitzer theatre organ in the centerpiece of the room. The fourth floor also featured a Louis XV styled dining room with a private chef for his family and friends. The fifth floor has a theatre and a large collection of pianos. The top floor featured his private penthouse. The collection's first four floors are open to the public free of charge with reserved guided tours.

In the late 1970s, Nethercutt purchased the Twenty Grand, the only 1933 Rollston Arlington Torpedo-bodied Duesenberg SJ and gave it a full original restoration, changing the exterior color from black to a metallic silver and refining the interior. Once the restoration was completed, Nethercutt entered it into Pebble Beach in 1980 and won Best of Show. Because of the car's reputation and beauty, it was exhibited in Essen, Germany as one of The Ten Most Beautiful Cars in the World.

In the early 2000s, the Nethercutt Collection expanded with a 40,000 square foot addition to the tower and a 60,000 square foot new display building directly across the street called the Nethercutt Museum, which is self-guided. Outside of the Museum are his CPR steam locomotive Royal Hudson No. 2839 with a 1912 Pullman private car. By 2004, Nethercutt Collection and Museum included nearly 250 automobiles and led Autoweek to call the Nethercutt Collection one of America's five greatest automobile museums. Jay Leno described Nethercutt's collection as a ""Smithsonian-style effort on the history of transportation in America"" and ""the hall of fame for cars."" Nethercutt passed the his company and the Collection down to his son Jack with his wife, Helen.

Concours d'Elegance competition
Nethercutt competed in dozens of Concours d'Elegance shows in North America with his cars from the Collection. By 2004, he was one of the most victorious competitors in history and had won several dozen of Best of Show awards, notably including the pinnacle Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance a record six times: 1958, 1959, 1969, 1970, 1980 with The Twenty Grand, and 1992, more than any other individual.

Nethercutt is widely considered as one of the greatest car competitors of all time.

Personal life

Nethercutt married his high school sweetheart Dorothy Sykes in 1933. Dorothy was a collector of David Winter sculpted ceramics, including cottages, miniature pianos, and dolls which are featured in the Nethercutt Collection. Their marriage lasted over 70 years and they had two children, Jack and Robert. They later had two grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Through Jack and his wife Helen he had three step great-grandchildren, the Richards boys.

Every year, Nethercutt would take dozens of cars from the Collection with family, friends, and invited guests on a cruise through the hills to a picnic at Frazier Park with catered foods from the professional chefs at the Collection. The event was described as one of the most exclusive items on any car lover's wish list. As Autoweek magazine put it, ""You can be as rich as Bill Gates or have a collection as big as that of the Sultan of Brunei, but you don’t get a personal invitation from J.B. Nethercutt himself.""

Nethercutt loved fishing and was a frequent visitor to the Lake of the Woods near Kenora, Canada. He later purchased a private island on the lake. Nethercutt once diverted his plane to Kenora for a fry feast at Ye Old Chip Truck. In 1985 he donated $1 million to the town for a new emergency department. Later the center and the road connecting it were named in honor after him.

Nethercutt was friends with fellow Los Angeles-based car enthusiasts and collectors Jay Leno, Barry Meguiar, and Bruce Meyer.

Aircraft 
Nethercutt owned several private aircraft through Merle Norman Aviation: a Gulfstream I, Gulfstream II, and a Cessna 206, alongside a small helicopter fleet.

Honors
The Nethercutt Emergency Center at the UCLA Medical Center, Santa Monica is named after J.B. Nethercutt.

The J.B. & Dorothy Nethercutt Most Elegant Closed Car Award at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance is named in their honor.

Death
Nethercutt died on December 6, 2004 in Santa Monica.

Storylines

2002–2005
Alfie Moon first appears when he is ejected from Walford East tube station for fare evasion. He then causes havoc in the local market by getting a refund from Winston (Ulric Browne) for a video he stole and tricking Martin Fowler (James Alexandrou) into giving him free fruit. After acquainting himself with a few residents, he sneaks into The Queen Victoria public house and helps himself to a drink behind the bar. The landlady, Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor), assumes that Alfie is Chris Wright (Tom Roberts), the new manager sent by an agency. Alfie takes advantage of the misunderstanding to commit identity fraud against Wright. Alfie packs any stock he could find in a bin bag, ready to leave. Jim Branning (John Bardon) catches him, but assumes Alfie is throwing away outdated stock and tricks Alfie into giving him a pint on the house. Winston, Martin, Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen) and Sam Mitchell (Kim Medcalf) realize that Alfie has told them all different background stories but he manages to reconcile the inconsistent stories. Alfie later answers the phone to the real Chris Wright and tells him the position is filled, revealing his intention to stay. Alfie's brother and grandmother arrive unannounced in Albert Square and move into the pub with Alfie, much to his dismay. When Alfie is blackmailed by a former police officer, Dougie Slade (John Bowler), who reveals Alfie's true identity to Peggy, Alfie and his family are forced to flee with the pub's takings. However, Alfie leaves the money on Peggy's doorstep. Peggy manages to track him down and after he confides in her about his parents' death, she gives him another chance. Alfie reluctantly accepts her proposal.

Alfie shares a bond with barmaid Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) and an attraction develops. Eventually Kat reciprocates his feelings and one night when the pub is closed, Kat reveals her feelings to him. They decide to embark on their relationship slowly, but his inability to trust her causes her to rethink the romance and she breaks up with Alfie, within less than a week. Alfie is heartbroken when Kat returns from a trip to New York with local mobster Andy Hunter (Michael Higgs), who soon becomes engaged to Kat after the trip. Andy, knowing Alfie's feelings for Kat, warns him to stay away from her and the wedding. Before the wedding, Kat visits Alfie's grandmother, Nana Moon (Hilda Braid) in hospital, and thinking she is asleep, admits she still loves Alfie. Nana tells Alfie and he rushes to the wedding to confess his true feelings as the ceremony takes place. Kat jilts Andy and he swears revenge before leaving Walford. Alfie and Kat quickly get engaged and decide to hold the wedding on Christmas Day, less than a month away. However, Alfie is still married to his first wife, Liza (Joanne Adams). Liza's mother, Marlene (Christine Ellerbeck) tells Alfie that their divorce is finalised, so he starts to prepare the wedding to Kat, until Liza reveals they are not divorced. There are only a few days before the wedding so he tries to quickly finalise the divorce while trying to keep it secret from Kat, though Liza makes it difficult as she wants Alfie to take her back. Alfie is forced to cancel the minister on Christmas Day and he panics, but gets his friend Ray (David Walliams) to pretend to be a minister, while planning to tell Kat the truth a few days later. Alfie's brother, Spencer Moon (Christopher Parker), warns Alfie not to start his marriage with a lie, so Alfie reveals the truth to a furious Kat. Alfie is about to tell the guests that the wedding is cancelled when his solicitor enters with Alfie's decree absolute. Alfie convinces the minister to cancel his Christmas lunch, and Alfie and Kat marry.

After a while, Alfie borrows several thousand pounds from Andy to bail out Kat's father, Charlie Slater (Derek Martin), who has been arrested for assault. Andy begins demanding cash every week, which he knows Alfie cannot afford. Andy's plan to wreck the Moons' marriage starts to work and Andy offers Kat the chance to pay off the debt by spending time with him in bed. She reluctantly agrees and they sleep together, with a reluctant Kat oozing with guilt. Though unknown to her, Alfie has paid Andy the money. Andy keeps the money and gives Alfie a video tape of Kat cheating on Alfie with him. They watch the sex tape together and she reveals the whole story behind her infidelity. When Alfie insults Kat, she slaps him, with him doing the same thing. Afterwards, the couple attempt to put the incident behind them but their marriage starts to deteriorate and Alfie is unable to trust Kat. She moves out of Walford for while. During her return, it is seen that Kat has become an alcoholic and isn't bothered by the fact that Alfie wants them to resume their marriage. Kat has sex with Roger (Russell Boulter), a stranger, while intoxicated and finally sees sense, deciding to return to Alfie, but he discovers she has slept with a man she doesn't know and throws her out, so she leaves Walford again.

Alfie shares a mutual connection with Kat's sister, Little Mo Mitchell (Kacey Ainsworth), whose marriage to Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick) has collapsed. Alfie helps Little Mo bring up her baby, Freddie, and they decide to announce that they are an item. However, Kat returns before they have a chance, and she makes it clear that she wants Alfie back. He is torn between the two sisters, eventually choosing Kat. He lets Little Mo down gently, and they share a final goodbye hug, which Billy assumes is them getting together. In the pub, Billy drunkenly announces that Alfie and Little Mo are an item. Kat is furious and decides not to get together with Alfie, so as not to break her sister's heart. However, Alfie and Kat continue to grow closer, due to Kat's relationship with Alfie's grandmother, who is dying. After Kat helps Alfie complete some of Nana's final wishes and overcome her death, they long for each other. Alfie announces that he is leaving to drive across the United States in a Ford Capri, and it seems he has gone for good when he waves goodbye to a heartbroken Kat on Christmas Day 2005. After getting drunk and drowning her sorrows in the pub, Kat is stunned to see Alfie waiting for her outside. Kat and Alfie then get into the car together and drive off.

2010–2016

Kat returns to London, revealing that she and Alfie conned a man called Frankie Finnerty and she is now on the run. His relatives Lee and Jono Finnerty (Dylan Brown and Colin Parry) track her down but Alfie scares them off by pretending to be a CID officer, though they take most of Kat's money. Alfie and Kat have a heart to heart and it is revealed that Alfie spent six months in prison for property fraud and they tried to have a baby but he has fertility problems. Kat is not interested and tries to leave, telling him that she is pregnant and he is not the father. Alfie doubles the remainder of Kat's money in a bet and promises to stop scamming and get a proper job. Kat gives him 24 hours. He uses Kat's money and uses it to rent The Queen Vic from Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). Kat is angry and demands he get the money back as they need a regular income. Instead, he sets up an illegal drinking den in the cellar and they move into Kim Fox's (Tameka Empson) caravan on the Square.

Alfie hires Greg Jessop (Stefan Booth) to refurbish The Queen Vic and Alfie's cousin, Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd), gives him money for The Queen Vic lease. He introduces Michael to Kat and Michael says that he is returning to Spain and asks her to go with him. He leaves a letter and some money for Alfie, revealing that he is the baby's father. Alfie tells Kat that he wants the baby but she doesn't believe him and agrees to leave with Michael but changes her mind when she sees that Alfie has bought a cot and some baby toys. Alfie struggles to pay the rent and tries gambling again but loses. However, Phil's cousin Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons) helps out by paying two months rent for him and he shows Kat the newly refurbished pub. However, on the day of the grand opening, there is a problem so the pub doesn't open until the next day. Kat sees Alfie and Roxy together and fights with Roxy. Alfie takes Roxy's side and ejects Kat but they reconcile and Alfie suggests renewing their wedding vows and Kat agrees. The day does not go quite according to plan as Alfie helps Roxy with her sister Ronnie Mitchell's (Samantha Womack) wedding. However, Kat decides that she does not need a big ceremony so she and Alfie have one in the Square with just him and Kat.

Kat gives birth to a boy named Tommy but is rushed to hospital as she haemorrhages, due to a damaged placenta. Charlie decides to join the New Year's party, rather than stay with Tommy so he is unattended when Ronnie Mitchell finds herself in The Queen Vic with her dead son and she swaps the babies. When Alfie gets home, he finds ""Tommy"" dead in his cot. Kat and Alfie struggle to cope with their loss but eventually start to deal with it until Michael returns, wanting to see his son. Kat tells Michael to leave but he stays because he has friends locally. Kat kisses Michael but he rejects her, leading her to break down. Eventually Alfie moves out after they have a row and goes away for a weekend with Michael. Kat tells Alfie that a coroner has confirmed that Tommy (James) died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. He comforts her and they reconcile. Eventually, Ronnie admits to Kat that she swapped the babies and returns Tommy. Alfie and Kat are reunited with Tommy after talking to a social worker. Ronnie goes to prison for her crime and Kat forgives her. She and Alfie holiday in Spain, leaving Alfie's cousin, Eddie Moon (David Essex), to look after the pub. When they return, they bring Shenice Quinn (Lily Harvey) with them, daughter of Kat's friend, Martina Quinn (Tamara Wall). Kat finds out she is pregnant and Alfie asks who the father is, refusing to believe Kat has not cheated. Alfie realises he has gone too far but Kat is not interested in his apologies, even after she miscarries. She tells him she does not want any more children and that their relationship will just be for show from now on, leading her to have a one-night stand with Mark Garland (Chris Simmons), which she regrets after hearing Alfie's voicemail, saying how much he loves her. Alfie takes Kat, Tommy and Shenice on holiday but when they return, Kat tells Alfie that she cheated. They discuss it and Alfie insists that he would rather Kat cheat on him than not have her in his life. Kat isn't happy and is further upset when Alfie will not allow her to explain that she did not cheat again. They try to mend things over Christmas but Alfie hears Kat say that she does not think he loves her. Alfie pays a friend Gerry (Paul Reynolds) to claim he is a marriage counsellor and tell Kat that their marriage can be mended. However, when Alfie deliberately leaves them alone, she says she thinks Alfie does not love her and she wants to end the marriage. Gerry tries to tell Alfie but he thinks that Gerry has helped. When Charlie has a stroke, Alfie and Kat visit but he returns alone. Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman) gets Alfie into a VAT scam and Alfie helps Roxy and Billy set Derek up by intercepting his alcohol deliveries. Alfie struggles financially and considers firing Jean and stores Derek's goods at the pub to earn extra cash but when Phil demands Alfie stop, Derek arranges with Alfie and Billy to steal a large amount of alcohol. However, Derek is scammed by Alfie and Billy and he suspects Phil conned him. When Billy is arrested on suspicion of murdering Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison), Derek worries that he may implicate them in the alcohol theft and asks Alfie to frame Phil by hiding goods at his garage. However, Alfie is caught and Phil confronts him, making it clear that Alfie takes orders from him, not Derek. When Derek learns that Alfie has told Phil everything, he furiously threatens Alfie.

In Kat's absence, Alfie and Roxy become close friends and Roxy tells Alfie that she is in love with him. This makes things awkward and she quits her job at the pub. After a while, Alfie manages to convince Roxy to return and offers her a place to stay. Jean is conned out of money that belongs to The Queen Victoria while Alfie is away and when he returns, he borrows money from Roxy to pay the bills, angering Kat. Alfie starts a pub football team and pays more attention to that than to Kat, so she starts an affair. Kat tries to resist but eventually the affair turns to love. When Kat's lover sends her flowers, Alfie becomes suspicious and asks Kat if she is seeing someone else. She denies it initially but eventually admits it, refusing to say who the other man is. Alfie demand Kat end the affair but Alfie struggles to trust Kat, especially when he finds a ring he thought had been pawned. Wanting to catch her out, Alfie says he will be away overnight and follows her to a nearby flat, demanding to know who Kat is seeing but she still refuses to name him. Alfie finds a letter to ""Mr. Branning"" and confronts the three brothers, attacking Max when he sees that Kat is calling. Kat arrives and tells him that she is seeing Derek. Alfie throws Kat out again and Derek makes matters worse when he plays Alfie a message, asking to meet. Alfie punches Derek and tells him that he is barred before giving Derek his wedding ring to give to Kat. Alfie starts dating Roxy and asks her to move in and they declare their love for each other. Alfie helps Kat when she is questioned over stolen goods, but to prove to Roxy that he loves her, Alfie decides to get a divorce. Alfie and Roxy decide to try for a baby, but when Kat and Alfie's decree nisi comes through, it is apparent that Alfie still loves Kat. He is determined to move on so proposes to Roxy and she accepts.

Alfie discovers Ronnie is being released from prison but thinks that she will not return to Walford. He is angry to discover that she has and demands Roxy choose, him or Ronnie. Roxy chooses Alfie but Kat persuades him to accept Ronnie's presence and let Roxy see her sister. Kat supports Alfie after Michael's death and the two become closer. The night before his wedding, Alfie visits Kat and they kiss passionately. On his wedding day, Alfie tells Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) that he still loves Kat but marries Roxy. Roxy realises that Alfie is still in love with Kat and orders him out of the church. He learns that Kat is going to Ibiza and races to the airport. They reconcile, moments before her flight is due to depart. As revenge for Alfie's treatment of Roxy, Phil sells The Queen Vic, forcing Alfie and Kat out. Kat tells Alfie that she is pregnant and they move in with Kat's grandmother, Mo Harris (Laila Morse). Kat has a market stall, selling women's clothes, but Alfie isn't as successful as goes to help Spencer  in Australia for a while. He returns a month later and tells Kat that he has just bought a classic Ford Capri. After a night in a posh hotel, they return to Walford and Alfie sets up a burger bar on the Square but this is taken away so he sets up a men's clothes stall instead. This doesn't last thanks to a feud with the market inspector, Aleks Shirovs (Kristian Kiehling), so he gets a job at Ian's café. Kat and Alfie are thrilled when their twin sons, Bert and Ernie (Freddie and Stanley Beale), are born.

Alfie receives a letter from the council, stating that they are due to be evicted from No. 23 Albert Square. He doesn't tell Kat but Stacey finds it and forces him to tell Kat and Mo. Alfie tells Kat that he has got a bank loan but considers starting a fire for the insurance money. Despite Mick Carter (Danny Dyer) advising him against it, he drops a lit cigarette into a paper-filled wastebasket. When outside, he learns Kat is in the house and rushes back to rescue her but Mo's stash of dodgy hairspray causes an explosion, just as Alfie opens the front door. He rescues Kat regardless, receiving minor burns, but Kat is badly burnt. Alfie and the Moons are supported by the local community and stay with the Masood family. Alfie is praised as a hero, despite being suspected by local firefighter Tosh. However, the fire investigation officer declares the fire an accident but Mick advises him not to tell Kat that he started the fire and when Kat thanks him for saving her life, he takes Mick's advice. He is relieved when the fire investigation officer Neil Wallace informs him that the insurers will probably pay for the damage to be repaired but Stacey finds the picture of Nana Moon and realises Alfie started the fire and demands Alfie tell Kat but he refuses, creating a rift between them. The insurance company also refuse to pay for the damage as Mo's quantity of hairspray is listed as commercial goods, invalidating the policy. He tells Stacey Branning (Lacey Turner) and she suggests ringing the insurance company again but Alfie refuses, adamant that they won’t change their decision and blames Mo. Stacey then suggests Alfie use the proceeds from selling the Capri to sort out their finances but he can't as the money was spent on food and the children. Masood Ahmed (Nitin Ganatra) returns home and asks Alfie when they will be moving out as the house is too crowded but Alfie loses his temper with Masood and accuses him of kicking them out.

Needing a place of their own, Alfie tries to persuade an estate agent to let him stay in number 43 for a couple of nights but the agent dismisses the idea. So he goes to the council for temporary accommodation and is told that all they can offer is one night in a bed and breakfast. Returning to the Square, Alfie tells Stacey about the mess they’re in and she insists he tell Kat the truth but before he can, she asks him to marry her. He agrees and they marry at the registrar's office with two nurses as witnesses and return to Walford. They squat in a couple of places before Mick invites them to stay at The Queen Vic. After an emotional speech from Kat to the social housing manager, they are offered a council house in Hull but just as they are about to leave, Kat finds a photo of Nana. Wanting to know how it survived the fire, Alfie admits that he started it and tries to apologise, but Kat leaves him, moving in with Stacey and Lily. Later, as Christmas approaches, Alfie tells Kat that he will try to fix things.

Mo tells Kat that Harry left her some money in his will. Alfie finds out, and tries to convince her to use the money to make a fresh start after the divorce but she destroys the cheque, insisting it doesn't change the past nor their impending divorce. Kat has second thoughts about the divorce after Pam Coker (Lin Blakley) gives a speech about love and family and Stacey tells Alfie that their rent is increasing and Kat is struggling financially so Alfie invites Kat to his flat for lunch and they reminisce about their relationship. The next day, Kat lashes out at Alfie for leaving leftovers for the kids, but at Stacey's urging, she agrees to be his date to Ian and Jane's wedding if he makes more effort for making up for the fire.

Mo has Harry's money transferred to her account and tells Alfie. He insists that this is not good for Kat and tells her so she burns the money. Sadly, this makes her very depressed and she tries to commit suicide but Alfie finds her and calls an ambulance. At the hospital, he admits that he is still in love with her. He takes her home and decides to stay temporarily to help her with the kids and her assessment by Social Services. During the social worker's visit, Kat is withdrawn and won't answer questions, insisting she is fine but Alfie tells the social worker that they are working on it and admits feeling guilty for starting the fire. After Kat visits a convent (Zoe's birthplace), she makes peace with the past and tells Alfie and Stacey that she will claim the money. Alfie and Stacey discover that Kat's claim won't grant her any money so he takes Kat on a trip to central London, giving them a chance to reminisce before having lunch at a posh restaurant. Kat knows that she won't get any compensation and is disgusted when Alfie tells her he already knew. Soon after, Kat takes the opportunity to tell Alfie that she wants them to reconcile and although initially resisting, he changes his mind once back in Walford. On the spur of the moment, they buy a scratchcard and realise they have won £1,000,000. Alfie and Kat decide to use the money to move somewhere new and run a bar. Alfie suggests going to Australia but he and Kat decide to return to Spain so she can be closer to Zoe. But after tests, a doctor tells Alfie he may have a brain tumour. Kat buys plane tickets for the next day and Alfie chooses not to tell Kat about the tumour and ignore warnings that the tumour will grow. Sonia Fowler (Natalie Cassidy) also advises him not to fly as this could cause problems so they drive to Spain.

On Christmas Day 2015, Kat returns to Walford to spend Christmas with Stacey. Alfie follows with the boys. While at Mick's stag party, Alfie tells Ian and Phil that he may have a brain tumour. Ian and Phil go with him to a hospital appointment, where he learns that the tumour has stopped growing but he may need an operation if he begins showing symptoms. Alfie tells Kat about his tumour and in turn, Kat tells Alfie that she has a son living in Ireland. After Charlie dies from a heart attack, Kat and Alfie decide to search for her son. After saying their goodbyes, Kat and Alfie depart.

Kat & Alfie: Redwater
In episode 1 of Kat & Alfie: Redwater, Alfie, Kat and Tommy arrive in the Irish town of Redwater, saying they are on holiday. Alfie tells Kat to make friends before asking questions and trying to find her son and when she immediately thinks it is Andrew Kelly (Peter Campion), Alfie warns her that she could be wrong. Alfie starts to have visions and gets scared when he goes outside in the night and almost falls from a cliff. Alfie finds out about the Redwater Tragedy from local priest, Dermott Dolan (Oisín Stack), in which Dermott's mother, Iris Dolan (Orla Hannon) drowned in a boating accident. In episode 2, Alfie gets stuck up a cliff when helping Tommy, but Dermott rescues him. Tommy goes missing but Kat finds him in the church and discovers that Dermott is her son. In episode 3, Alfie realises that Kat lied to Dermott about who Dermott's father is, which results in an argument. By episode 5, Alfie is worried about his hallucinations and has a brain scan, lying to Kat about where he is going. He then tells Dermott that his tumour has grown and asks Dermott to baptise him, which he does. In episode 6, Alfie prepares for an operation on his brain, and is told his recovery could take weeks so he will be unable to return to Spain as planned. He asks Dermott to bring Kat to the hospital, but Dermott does not do this because the police suspect he was involved in the death of Lance Byrne (Ian McElhinney). Alfie is unable to wait and during the surgery, Alfie loses his pulse and at the same time, Kat is seriously injured in a boating accident caused by Dermott's attempting to escape. Medical staff start to resuscitate Alfie as the episode ends.

2018–2019
Having recovered from his operation, Alfie and Kat return to Spain to run a bar. Mo returns in March 2018 and reveals that Kat and Alfie had an argument and that he fled with the children shortly afterwards and no one knows where he is. On her return to Walford shortly afterwards, Kat reveals that Alfie is in Spain with their children, running a different bar with a Russian partner, Dimitri, after their old bar lost a fortune. She insists that the two are taking a break from their marriage. Two months later, Hayley Slater (Katie Jarvis) visits Alfie, who is staying in London, and it is revealed that Alfie threw Kat out after Tommy accidentally caused severe burns to Ernie while she was in bed with Dimitri. Hayley reveals that she is pregnant and that Alfie is the father following a drunken one-night stand in Spain. Alfie tries to persuade Hayley to terminate the pregnancy and returns to Spain, but Hayley decides to keep the baby.

Kat gets a video call from Alfie and he asks her to collect something for him. Believing him to still be in Spain, she follows his instructions and goes to a chapel where she is surprised to see Alfie in person. Alfie is running a funeral business and has many clients lined up, but Kat is unimpressed and only sees it as a scam. She is angry that he has not brought their children with him, but apologies for cheating on him with Dimitri. Kat tells him to stop his lies and jokes and she leaves. The following week Kat speaks to Alfie, who is back in Spain, by video call and she is angry when he says he lied to her and actually did bring the children with him to London. Two weeks later, during Hayley's birthday party, Kat answers the door and is shocked to see Alfie standing on the doorstep. Though he reunites with Kat, he is stunned to realise that Hayley did not terminate her pregnancy, and insists they keep the truth hidden from Kat. Hayley develops feelings for him when she sees him bond with their daughter, named Cherry by Alfie after his deceased mother. Jean, who is the only one who has found out about Alfie being Cherry's father, insists that Alfie tell Kat or she will.

Stacey sees Hayley and Alfie kissing and is horrified to uncover Cherry's paternity and issues an ultimatum: one of them leaves, or Kat learns the truth. Hayley decides to go, but her parting gift to Alfie – a lock of Cherry's hair – is discovered by Kat and she works out the truth. After a furious showdown, Alfie turns nasty with Kat, who accuses him of taking advantage of Hayley's vulnerability. Hayley defends Kat and pushes Alfie, causing him to fall down the stairs and knock himself unconscious. Believing that he is dead, Hayley, Kat and Stacey discuss what to do to protect Hayley from going to prison. Kat privately says a tender goodbye to Alfie, kissing him and telling him she loves him. As the police arrive, they discover that Alfie survived and has left, taking Cherry with him. The next day, Alfie meets Phil, who gives him fake passports but warns Alfie to think carefully about his plans. Alfie then listens to a voicemail Kat left him on his phone, pleading with him to bring Cherry back. Alfie eventually contacts Kat and Hayley via video chat and says he will bring Cherry back soon. On New Year's Day, Alfie and Kat meet and Kat tries to talk him into returning Cherry but Alfie admits he cannot bring himself to do it, fearing he would only be granted limited visitation time, and suggests he and Kat adopt Cherry and leave together. Kat tells Alfie she accepts and brings Alfie to the house, claiming it is empty but when Alfie arrives, he is confronted by Stacey, Mo and Jean. Angry and upset, he shows them Ernie's scars caused by Kat's irresponsibility. When Kat takes the children for ice cream, she gives Alfie the option to take them with him on the condition that he brings Cherry back to Hayley. Alfie eventually relents to return Cherry and leave their children with Kat, admitting that he loves her and only wanted her to be happy. The next day, after emotionally attempting to say goodbye to Cherry, Alfie changes his mind and attempts to drive out of Walford with her but finds himself stuck in traffic. This forces him to reevaluate his decision and he turns back and returns Cherry to Hayley. An overjoyed but protective Hayley tells a dejected Alfie that she cannot let him be a part of Cherry's life. After learning of this from Ian, a sympathetic Kat allows him to spend time with their children.

Several days later, Alfie does some DIY work at the Slater house, while Kat resists all his attempts to charm her but eventually relents to an early birthday lunch at The Queen Vic with him, Mo, Stacey, her husband Martin Fowler (James Bye), Jean Slater (Gillian Wright) and Cherry, whom Hayley allows him to bring along for the day. After finding that his credit card has been declined and making a toast to Kat, Alfie receives a phone call from the bank, causing him to rush over to the Beale house where he is staying where he finds overdue bills from running his funeral business. The next day, after Alfie unsuccessfully tries to help Hayley with feeding Cherry her breast milk, the father of a deceased client accuses Alfie of stealing his son's money after a mix-up with the funeral plans, and Ian threatens to kick Alfie out for stealing his food. Under stress, Alfie confesses his troubles to a horrified Kat, including the fact that some of the money was paid for her new fireplace. In order to reimburse the client's family and pay the bills, Alfie decides to look for investors for the business and Ian offers to buy a 50% stake in the business for a loan with 20% interest, which he accepts. Later, after explaining this to a concerned Kat, who reprimands him for his schemes, Alfie and the rest of the Slaters are stunned to find Hayley unconscious from drinking after locking herself in the bathroom with Cherry. Knowing she is struggling being a mother, Alfie suggests to Kat that they adopt Cherry, but Kat is unsure. Soon after, customers of Alfie's funeral business start contacting him and one coming to see him in person, accusing him of swindling them of money. Needing to pay them back, he persuades Phil to lend him 30,000 pounds and offering his expensive car as collateral. Alfie then does a runner and Phil is angry when he takes the money and the car with him. Phil threatens Kat, saying she will pay back the money to him if Alfie does not. When she gets a text from Alfie telling her to look in the wardrobe, she is stunned when the money falls out of it, having left it behind for her. Although the text says he will be returning soon, he does not come back. Kat uses the money to pay for Jean's cancer treatment, leaving her in further debt to Phil. Phil later demands Kat find Alfie but she assures him she does not know where he is.

Creation and development
Alfie Moon was conceptualised by EastEnders''' scriptwriter Tony Jordan. The character is based on Jordan himself. Jordan has commented, ""Alfie is basically me – a Jack The Lad in jeans, cowboy boots and dodgy shirts who wears his heart on his sleeve."" Julia Crampsie, the BBC's casting executive, recommended that Shane Richie be considered for the role. Richie was already a familiar face to the UK audience, having had a career as an entertainer, appearing in various gameshows, variety shows and fronting advertising campaigns, most notably for the washing detergent Daz. Jordan was apprehensive about casting Ritchie in the role. He commented, ""I just had this image of the guy with the mullet from the Daz adverts. And if we had Shane where would it stop? Harry Hill? Les Dennis? Bradley Walsh? But Julia was insistent, so I went to a workshop where we'd see lots of actors and [Richie] was fantastic.""

Jordan has suggested that many of the rows featured on-screen between Alfie and his love-interest Kat were word-for-word arguments he had with his wife, Tracy. He commented, ""We'd be watching EastEnders at home, then an Alfie and Kat scene would start and I'd think, 'Oh shit', because I'd know what was coming. And then we'd have another row about how I don't argue properly because when we do argue I'm just making mental notes for stuff to write the next day.""

Reintroduction (2010)
On 7 February 2010 it was announced that Richie would return to the show to reprise the role in autumn 2010. The decision was made following the resignation from the show of Barbara Windsor, who played Peggy Mitchell, which left what executive producer Bryan Kirkwood described as a ""hole"" in the programme. Kirkwood decided that the time was right for Kat and Alfie to return, saying that they ""very much herald the new era of EastEnders."" Richie had ruled out a return in 2009, saying that the show had moved on from his character and he felt he did not have the energy to be in such a ""full-on"" show again. Richie commented on his return: ""It's an honour and a privilege to be asked back to the iconic series of EastEnders which is at the top of its game! I'm looking forward to finding out what Alfie has been up to over the last few years but more importantly – what the future has in store for him."" John Yorke, controller of BBC drama production, said: ""Alfie is one of EastEnders most loved and iconic characters, so he's bound to get a very warm welcome from viewers when he returns to Walford. We've had so many new and interesting characters settle into Albert Square since Alfie departed that it's going to make for fantastic viewing when one of the show's most familiar faces rides back into the East End."" It was reported by The Daily Mirror that Alfie and Kat would regain control of The Queen Victoria public house after it burns down. Controller of BBC drama production John Yorke predicted that their return would make ""fantastic viewing"", given the wealth of new characters introduced since their departure. Wallace and Richie were the first cast members signed by new executive producer Bryan Kirkwood.

The plot saw Alfie and Kat regaining control of The Queen Victoria public house after it burned down, and Kat returning to Walford pregnant, with some public suspicions about the paternity of her child. To promote the characters' return, the BBC released a trailer across the BBC network in September 2010. The western-themed trailer sees Kat outside of The Queen Victoria, with various characters looking on and Kat saying ""Where d'ya get a drink around 'ere?"" with Alfie replying ""I think you're gonna' need one."" The advertisement uses the tag line ""It's all kicking off in the square"". The return, in September 2010, drew 9.22 million viewers and 37.7% of the total TV viewing audience. Kat returned on 17 September 2010.

Talking to What's on TV, Wallace commented on Kat's reunion with Alfie. She said: ""She punches him! Alfie has come looking for her and hasn't seen her for months. He keeps saying to her 'You're fat' and she says 'I'm not fat. I'm pregnant!' Then she says, 'Don't worry Alfie, it ain't yours'. She's peed off with him. He's been in prison and she's had to survive on her own pregnant. But she loves him unconditionally. No matter what they do, they will always end up together. She wants stability... a future for the baby and her. She sets him this challenge and he buys it.""

Baby swap

Richie revealed in an interview with This Morning that Kat and Alfie would be involved in an ongoing storyline, which he said is ""going to be the biggest soap story in probably the history of soaps."" At the end of 2010, Kat and Ronnie both give birth on the same day, but Ronnie's baby, James, dies and while Kat is in hospital and her baby, Tommy, is unattended, Ronnie swaps the infants. The storyline received over 6,000 complaints, making it the second most complained about EastEnders storyline. It was then decided to end the storyline earlier than originally planned. It was reported by the Daily Star Sunday that Ronnie experiences a change of heart after visiting relatives in hospital and seeing the midwife who delivered her son. An EastEnders spokesperson said, ""We do not comment on future storylines but we have always said Ronnie will do the right thing and Tommy will be reunited with Kat."" Wallace revealed that she doesn't regret her involvement of the baby-swap storyline, saying that she was ""just doing her job"". Wallace told Bang Showbiz:""I stand by it. We're actors at the end of the day, we do our job and then we go home. It's drama, that's it."" She also praised Womack's acting and will move on to ""bigger and better things"" once she departs later this year. She added: ""[Samantha is] a fantastic actress who played a brilliant role in a fantastic storyline so I wish her all the best.""

Derek Martin said he was surprised by the new baby swap storyline when it was published in the media. Speaking on This Morning, Martin commented: ""I'm one of those actors – I don't know how many others do it – but when I get the scripts, I only read my bits. So I looked [and saw], 'Charlie leaves his grandson upstairs, goes downstairs, gets on the drink, gets drunk – the baby's dead'. So that's terrible guilt obviously – because I feel as though it's my fault that he's died. I was surprised when I saw the story come out – because I don't read the others' [lines] – that it was a baby swap."" Discussing the surrounding controversy of the plot, Martin added: ""Don't forget, there's millions of people – there's 60 odd million here, and they've all got different opinions. Every subject, everything that comes up… everybody will have opinions about that. So therefore you have to accept that's the public – some are for, some are against, and that's the way it is.""  He continues: ""Over the years, don't forget, EastEnders have always had subjects. When [Charlie's] brother had raped Kat and we didn't find out until later on, that was a very strong storyline. And when Little Mo was bashed by her husband Trevor. These stories are all part of real life.""

Samantha Womack admitted that she thought the plot was ""implausible"". She commented: ""I thought it was implausible. Most women who lose a child would not go out and abduct one,"" she told The Mirror. ""But Ronnie is a soap character and she is not necessarily representing real life. Soap is based on controversy and sensationalism because bosses are trying to get high ratings and they can't write things like 'Ronnie had a cup of tea'. Otherwise people wouldn't watch it."" On 1 August 2011, Ofcom cleared the storyline. The baby swap storyline prompted a huge 1,044 complaints reported to Ofcom. Ofcom also added that many of the complaints were made because the storyline was presented ""in an offensive manner"" because it ""appeared to suggest that a mother who has suddenly and tragically lost a baby through cot death would react by stealing another baby to replace that loss"". Kym Marsh supported Ofcom's decision to clear the storyline. Marsh wrote in her magazine section: ""Last week, EastEnders was cleared of wrongdoing by Ofcom, the media regulator, over its baby swap storyline, and I think that's the right decision. It's just a storyline, like any other. I understand why people got upset about it, but no-one meant to upset anybody. Soaps are supposed to portray real life to a certain extent, but it's meant to be high drama for entertainment purposes. I mean, how many murders can you have in one square? There's a nod to real life but, for the most part, soaps help take people out of the real world.""

Arson, second departure and Redwater

In August 2014, it was revealed that a fire would engulf the Slater house. On 2 September, it was revealed that Alfie would start the fire in return of an insurance claim, after having been broke following the birth of the twins, with Kat still inside. The fire and its aftermath took place on the week of 15 September 2014.

On 4 April 2015, it was announced that Richie would appear in a six-part BBC One drama series alongside Wallace. In the series, Kat and Alfie Moon will go to Ireland in the ""search for answers to some very big questions"". Commenting on the opportunity, Richie said: ""Both Jessie and I are absolutely thrilled to be given this amazing opportunity. To have a whole drama focused around Kat and Alfie is a huge honour for us both and we just can't wait to start filming."" The series, Kat & Alfie: Redwater, started in the UK on 18 May 2017 and Ireland on 14 May 2017.

Return (2018)

In March 2018 it was confirmed that Alfie would return to the show for a short stint to rejoin Kat. It was said that Richie would start filming in the coming weeks, and Alfie would reappear from summer 2018. He returned on 24 May 2018, appearing for two episodes before making another brief return between November 2018 and January 2019.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Anthony Firingee"", the article should at least have 250 words","Anthony Firingee (; Antōnī Phiringī; lit:""Anthony the foreigner""; 1786–1836), born as Hensman Anthony, was a Bengali language kavigan singer-writer and folk poet of Portuguese origin known for his works in Bengali devotional songs in the early part of the 19th century. He was also noted for his performance in literary face-offs known as Kavigan.

Biography
Born Hensman Anthony, the sobriquet Firingee (The foreigner of European origin) was used colloquially as a reference to his Portuguese origins. Although not much is known of his early life, Anthony arrived in Bengal sometime in early 19th century and subsequently came to settle in Farashdanga, in the town of Chandannagar in West Bengal.

He married a Hindu Brahmin widow named Saudamini and was deeply influenced by Bengali culture and language, as well as the Hindu religion. Eventually, Anthony came to learn the language and composed a number of noted religious songs in devotion to the Goddesses Kali and Durga. He is noted for his Agamani Songs, celebrating the return of Goddess Durga to her parents home that marks the Bengali Autumn festival of Durga Puja. Anthony is also noted for his literary face-offs in Kavigans, or Bard's duels, with a number of noted Bengali composers including Bhola Moira, Ram Basu and Thakur Singha. Anthony also helped construct a temple to Goddess Kali in the Bowbazar locality of Central Calcutta known as 'Firinghi Kalibari'. His wife Saudamini was burnt to death, for being a widow and remarrying Anthony, who was a foreigner.

In popular culture
 Books
The first reference to Anthony Firingee is a novel by Madan Bandopadhay titled Kabiyal Anthony Firingee.

 Films
 A 1967 Bengali film by director Sunil Bannerjee portrayed the life and works of Anthony, and had Bengali actor Uttam Kumar in the title role. The film was noted for its music, composed by Anil Bagchi & lyrics by Gouri Prasanna Majumdar among others and earned Uttam Kumar an Indian National Film Award for Best Actor in 1968.
 A 2014 adaptation by director Srijit Mukherji titled Jaatishwar featured the life of Anthony from a retrospective view but with a modern-day context. Jaatishwar also received an Indian National Film Awards in 2014, in four categories, including Best singer and Best Music Director.

1786 births"," Anthony Firingee (1768–1793), also known as Anthony Freire, was an 18th-century Portuguese-Indian Catholic, who was famous for having learned and taught the Bengali language, and for having translated the Bible into Bengali. Anthony was born in the city of Chinsurah, West Bengal, India, to a Portuguese father and a Bengali mother. He was raised in a Catholic household, and at the age of 14 was sent to the University of Portugal to study medicine. He returned to India in 1793, and worked as a doctor in his father's clinic in Chinsurah. It was after his return from Portugal that Anthony became interested in the local culture and language. He learned to speak, read, and write in Bengali, and soon became famous for his knowledge of the language. He also translated parts of the Bible into Bengali, and is said to have taught Bengali to the Portuguese priests in the area. Anthony Firingee died in 1793, at the age of 35, from a fever. After his death, his work was carried on by his brother, Joseph Firingee, who was also a Portuguese-Indian Catholic and a fluent Bengali speaker.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,24107697,0.0759493670886076,0.06315789473684211,0.21525019857029387,0.045171339563862926,2,4,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0.22058762536403728,0.018119814944839777,0.003728251864125932,0.013513513513513514,2,0,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,5,1,8,1,1,1
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""TweenTribune"", the article should at least have 250 words","TweenTribune is a free, not-for-profit online newspaper for kids, aged 8–15. It is updated daily with stories from the Associated Press that are chosen based on relevancy to pre-adolescents. Tweens can post comments to the stories which are moderated by their teachers, and teachers can use the site as a resource for meeting No Child Left Behind requirements for reading, writing and computer skills. The site first appeared on Nov 21, 2008.

TweenTribune has been featured in articles in the Los Angeles Times, Good Housekeeping and Family Circle magazine (December 2009).

Financial model
TweenTribune.com is a proof-of-concept model for new ways to fund journalism online. The site employs a series of previously untried methods for building audience and revenue. These strategies grew audience and revenue in a matter of weeks, but it remains too soon to tell whether these strategies are the ""silver bullet"" that media companies seek to funding journalism in the digital age.

Quoted on Dec. 15, 2009, James Rainey of the Los Angeles Times said founder Alan Jacobson's ""ebullient innovation opens a door for an underserved audience and provides the kind of incremental revenue that, strand by strand, eventually just might rope journalism back to a financial mooring.""

Business model
To achieve sustainability, the site uses a group of strategies to reduce cost:

1. As of January 2010, all content is provided by outside sources. Stories come from the Associated Press, while comments are generated by children in the form of user-generated content (UGC).

2. Editing of comments is provided by teachers, so editing is distributed among users as a means of reducing cost rather than centralizing editing with a paid staff. This is an example of distributive editing (DE).

3. Primary source code is provided by Drupal, a free, open-source code content management system. The site also depends upon other open-source applications, such as Linux, Apache, PHP and MySQL.

4. All custom source code was written by Ebizon Netinfo of Noida, India which was more economical than developing the code in the US.

Revenue streams
Four diversified revenue streams form a previously untested business model for online news:

1. Local and national advertising is targeted demographically, based on the appeal of the content to a youth audience, and geographically, with specific local ads served up based on the IP address of the user. The user's location determines which ads they see.

2. Sponsorships by national advertisers are targeted demographically, based on the appeal of the adjacent news content. Sponsorships can also be targeted topically, on such subjects as Animals, Technology, Fashion, etc.

3. License fees are paid by local media companies for permission to post their local content as a means of promoting their local brands and creating the next generation of news consumers. In addition, local media companies can sell advertising which is targeted geographically. Newspapers using this model include The Valdosta Daily Times, The Traverse City Record-Eagle and the Brainerd Dispatch. Other newspapers using TweenTribune include the Bakersfield Californian, The Virginian-Pilot and the Free Lance-Star in Fredericksburg, VA.

4.""Freemium"" model, in which basic features are provided to teachers and students at no cost, with specific value-added features that are provided at an additional, nominal cost.

History
Alan Jacobson, president of BrassTacksDesign, created TweenTribune as a way of helping his 10-year-old daughter with her homework.

Launched on Nov 21, 2008, the site showed little traffic in its first year of existence. But in October 2009 page views began to jump dramatically after a new promotional campaign was launched that marketed the site directly to teachers — a strategy that hadn't been tried before.

Based on traffic recorded in May 2010, the site now has 3.4 million page views per month, and 26,000 teachers are registered. TweenTribune is used in 50,000 classrooms in the U.S., Australia, Canada and Japan.

William Collins House (disambiguation)
Collins Building (disambiguation)"," Collins House Collins House, in Melbourne, Australia, is the home of the museum known as the National Gallery of Victoria. The house was built in 1856–1858 to the design of Scottish architect William Butterfield (1840–1900), who was responsible for the design of many of the city's notable buildings. It is one of the few remaining examples of domestic Gothic Revival architecture in Australia, and one of the earliest examples of concrete construction in the country. The house was built for the wealthy gold rush-era businessman James Wilson Collins (1815–1898), a noted collector of art and coins, who lived there with his family from 1858 to his death in 1898. Collins's collection formed the basis of the National Gallery of Victoria's collection. The house was sold to the state of Victoria in 1903, along with the collection, by Collins's widow, Margaret. In the early 1960s, a substantial extension designed by the architect Roy Grounds was added to the house, and it was subsequently renamed the National Gallery of Victoria. The extension, which retained the house's original address of 180 St Kilda Road, was opened in 1968. The National Gallery of Victoria includes Australian and international art. In the late 1980s, a decision was made to build a new building for the museum, to be designed by the architect Mario Bellini. In 2002, the new building, known as the Ian Potter Centre, was opened at nearby Federation Square. The house was then closed to the public, and was used for some time as a back-of-house facility. In 2008, the house was refurbished and reopened to the public as part of the National Gallery of Victoria's 150th anniversary celebrations. The refurbished house included a new exhibition space for the display of Australian and international art, an education center, and a cafe. In 2009, the house was renamed the Ian Potter House after the National Gallery of Victoria received a A$30 million donation from the Ian Potter Foundation. The house is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,14921728,0.012658227848101266,0.1368421052631579,0.25019857029388404,0.27258566978193144,3,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0.6221234053263541,0.022092772863226817,0.012565589616128142,0.02334152334152334,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,4,1,1,1

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Robert Small (trade unionist)"", the article should at least have 250 words","Robert Mathieson Small (14 April 1873 – 26 September 1918) was a Scottish trade unionist and political activist.

Small was born in Glasgow, the second son of William Small, who became the secretary of the Lanarkshire Miners' County Union (LCMU), and Janet ""Jessie"" Bell Scott. Robert was the younger brother of William B. Small and older brother of Lothian Small.  Robert followed his father and William B. by becoming an agent of the LCMU; in his case, covering the Harthill area.

The LCMU was part of the Scottish Miners' Federation (SMF), so when the Amalgamated Miners and Manual Workers Union (AMMW) in West Lothian left the SMF, Small was sent to the area to attempt to found a rival union.  He tried to persuade leading activist James Doonan to join the new endeavour, but Doonan refused, and eventually the AMMW rejoined the SMF.  Although not a success, this did lead to him spending a period as secretary of the small Scottish Shale Miners and Manual Workers' Union.

Small's father had been a founder member of the Independent Labour Party (ILP), and Small joined in 1907, soon becoming its Scottish secretary.  The ILP was affiliated to the Labour Party and, as a result, Small stood for Labour in North West Lanarkshire at the January 1910 general election, but took only 9.7% of the vote and third place.  Soon after, he joined the more radical Social Democratic Federation (SDF), for whom he stood for Lanarkshire County Council later in the year, but again missed out on election.  The SDF later became the British Socialist Party, which considered putting Small forward as a candidate in the 1913 Linlithgowshire by-election, although it ultimately did not do so.   Small appears to have remained a member of the ILP and on good terms with its leaders during this period.

Small took a variety of full-time trade union posts, including Scottish Organiser of the General Federation of Trade Unions, and Glasgow and Clyde Organiser of the Workers' Union.  He also became the first Glasgow secretary of the Workers' Educational Association.

He died in London in 1918.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Symplegades"", the article should at least have 250 words","The Symplegades (; , Symplēgádes) or Clashing Rocks, also known as the Cyanean Rocks, were, according to Greek mythology, a pair of rocks at the Bosphorus that clashed together whenever a vessel went through. They were defeated by Jason and the Argonauts, who would have been lost and killed by the rocks except for Phineus' advice. Jason let a dove fly between the rocks to see exactly how fast they'd have to row to beat the rocks; the dove lost only its tail feathers. The Argonauts rowed mightily to get through and lost only part of the stern ornament. After that, the Symplegades stopped moving permanently.

The European rock is usually identified with an islet, about  wide and  long, which stands about  off the shore of a village called Rumelifeneri ('Lighthouse of Rumeli’), and is connected to it by a modern concrete jetty. At its highest point, there is an ancient altar known as the Pillar of Pompey, though it has nothing to do with Pompey.  Dionysius of Byzantium mentions a Roman shrine to Apollo on one of the Cyanean Rocks, and the 16th-century French traveller Petrus Gyllius thought the altar was a remnant of that shrine.

The Asian rock is probably a reef off the Yum Burnu (north of Anadolu Feneri 'Lighthouse of Anatolia'), described by Gyllius:
The reef is divided into four rocks above water which, however, are joined below; it is separated from the continent by a narrow channel filled with many stones, by which as by a staircase one can cross the channel with dry feet when the sea is calm; but when the sea is rough, waves surround the four rocks into which I said the reef is divided.  Three of these are low and more or less submerged, but the middle one is higher than the European rock, sloping up to an acute point and roundish right up to its summit; it is splashed by the waves but not submerged and is everywhere precipitous and straight.

Names

The Romans called them Cyaneae Insulae (""Blue Islands""), and in Turkish they are called Öreke Taşı (""Distaff Rock"" or ""Midwife's Stool"").

In literature

Lord Byron refers to the Symplegades in the concluding stanzas of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage:

The New Critic I. A. Richards refers to 'Symplegades' in his work Practical Criticism. In Chapter 2, 'Figurative Language', he refers to dangers of misinterpretation in reading poems:
""These twin dangers - careless, 'intuitive' reading and prosaic, 'over-literal' reading - are the Symplegades, the 'justling rocks', between which too many ventures into poetry are wrecked.""

In his 1961 novel Jason, Henry Treece depicts the Symplegades as icebergs that drifted downriver into the Black Sea.

The Wandering Rocks

The Symplegades are sometimes identified with (or confused with) the Planctae () or Wandering Rocks, which are mentioned in the Odyssey and Apollonius of Rhodes' Argonautica.  In Apollonius's telling, the Symplegades were encountered on the way to the Golden Fleece and the Planctae were encountered on the return voyage.

The similarities and differences between the Wandering Rocks and the Symplegades have been much debated by scholars, as have potential locations for them. (See also Geography of the Odyssey.)

Locations in Greek mythology
Argonautica"," Symplegades The Symplegades or Symplectic Islands (Greek: Συμπλεγές or Συμπλεγέηνσι) are two small islands in the Gulf of Xanthi, northern Greece, the easternmost part of the Thracian Sea. They are situated near the coast of Thrace, in the region of East Macedonia and Thrace. These two islands are the largest of three groups of islands in the Gulf of Xanthi. The other islands are the IXAPEA Islands and the Islets of Chrysi. The islands are covered with forests and have a total area of 2.07 km2. The distance between the two islands is 700 m. The bigger one is called Avram and the smaller one is Planitis. There are many legends associated with the Symplegades. According to Greek mythology, the Symplegades were two immortal eagles, who lived on the two islands. They were said to be always fighting each other with their beaks. When they fought, they would clash together with such force that they would create loud noises, like clashing metal. The word ""symplegades"" is derived from the Greek words ""σύμπληγος"" (symplēgos), meaning ""clashed together"", and ""σύμφωνος"" (symphōnos), meaning ""loud noise"". The Symplegades were also said to be very rich in gold and other treasures, which were guarded by the two eagles. Many tried to retrieve the treasures, but were unsuccessful because of the fighting eagles. Eventually, the heroes Jason and the Argonauts were able to retrieve the treasures with the help of the goddess Athena. The Symplegades are also associated with the myth of the Amazon women. It was said that the Amazon women would ride on the backs of the eagles and use them to fly to the islands to retrieve the treasures. The Symplegades are located in a strategic position in the Gulf of Xanthi, which is a major shipping route. They are also a popular tourist destination.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,80996,0.04746835443037975,0.15789473684210525,0.1503839025681758,0.22429906542056074,7,3,0,0,7,1,0,1,0,0,0.25341807983450365,0.022676402917459097,0.007456503728251864,0.013513513513513514,11,2,6,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,1,15,1,1,1
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Nadir Ali Khan"", the article should at least have 250 words","

Early life 
Khan was born on 16 June 1931 in Rataul, into a family of Islamic scholars.  He was appointed as reader in Aligarh Muslim University, later becoming professor of Urdu Language and then honorary consultant of the department. 

Khan journeyed to acquaint himself with the centres of Islamic importance in India, where he met Sheikh ul-Hadith Muhammad Zakariya al-Kandahlawi (1898–1982) and the reformer Maulana Muhammad Yusuf Kandhalawi, from whom he learned dawah and reformation.

Soon after, he attended Lucknow University and earned a PhD.

Work 
Khan is a prolific writer in Urdu.  Perhaps his best-known work is A history in Urdu Journalism (1822–1857) (1991), which examines newspapers from nine different cities.

His works are part of the syllabi in various universities, and several have been translated into English.  His wide-ranging study of Urdu journalistic literature is a contribution of abiding value to the appreciation of India ethos at a crucial moment in Indian history.  His extensive study of contemporary Urdu literature, his rare insight into the process of social change and, above all, his unique faculty of analysis and interpretation are each reflected in his study which opens fresh vistas for the interpretation of socio-political history of modern India.  Lately the French historian Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie has studied the culture of the small French village Montaillou on the basis of Jacques Fouiern's Register's.  His work is rightly claimed as constituting a landmark in modern historiography.  No such work has so far been undertaken in India.  The newspapers from Mirzapur, Benaras, Meerut, Bareilly, Rampur, etc., brought to light by Khan, will hopefully one day attract scholars to undertake similar studies of the intellectual and social milieu of the Indian towns.  He prepared grounds for the utilization of journalistic literature for the reconstruction of the cultural history of India during the 19th century.

Due to his sermons and simple and modest lifestyle, Dr Nadir Ali Khan commands respect from Muslims all over the world.  He has a simple, eloquent and distinctive style of explaining the purpose of human life and its creation and often uses scientific examples to support his argument. He has delivered lectures to all types of communities in the society with the attendees being doctors, engineers, professors, businessmen, landlords, government officials, TV/film artists, ministers/politicians and sports celebrities. His untiring efforts brought real Islamic values in the lives of many Muslims.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Tessera (Venus)"", the article should at least have 250 words","A tessera (plural tesserae) is a region of heavily deformed terrain on Venus, characterized by two or more intersecting tectonic elements, high topography, and subsequent high radar backscatter. Tesserae often represent the oldest material at any given location and are among the most tectonically deformed terrains on Venus's surface. Diverse types of tessera terrain exist. It is not currently clear if this is due to a variety in the interactions of Venus's mantle with regional crustal or lithospheric stresses, or if these diverse terrains represent different locations in the timeline of crustal plateau formation and fall. Multiple models of tessera formation exist and further extensive studies of Venus's surface are necessary to fully understand this complex terrain.

Exploration
Pioneer Venus Orbiter detected regions of anomalous radar properties and high backscatter. Using SAR imaging, the Venera 15 and Venera 16 orbiters revealed these regions to be chaotically tiled terrain, which Soviet scientists named ""паркет"" (parquet), later known as ""tesserae."" The most recent data concerning tessera terrain comes from the Magellan Mission, in which the majority of Venus's surface was mapped in high resolution (~100 m/pixel). Future missions to Venus would allow for further understanding of tessera terrain.

Locations
Tesserae are recognized as covering 7.3% of Venus's surface, approximately 33.2×106 km, and occur mostly within a few extensive provinces. They are heavily concentrated between 0°E and 150°E. These longitudes represent a large area between a crustal extension center in the Aphrodite Terra and a crustal convergence center in Ishtar Terra. Tesserae are exposed almost entirely within Venus's crustal plateaus. Tessera inliers, regions of tessera not found within current crustal plateaus are thought to represent regions of collapsed crustal plateaus. Large regions of tessera terrain are labelled based on their latitude. Regions in the equatorial and southern latitudes are labelled as ""regio"" while regions in the northern latitudes are labelled as ""tesserae.""

A comprehensive list of regiones and tesserae can be found under List of geological features on Venus. Some well explored regions of tessera include:
Aphrodite Terra
Alpha Regio
Beta Regio
Fortuna Tessera
Ovda Regio

Formation

Tesserae represent an ancient time of globally thin lithosphere on Venus. Tessera Terrain does not participate in the global resurfacing events of Venus. It was thought by many researches that the tesserae might form a global ""onion skin"" of sorts, and extended beneath Venus's regional plains. However, the currently accepted models support regional formation. Multiple models have been put forward to explain the formation of tessera terrain. Models of formation by mantle downwelling and pulsating continents are the most currently accepted models. A model of formation due to a lava pond via bolide impact was put forth, although it has not currently gained much traction in the scientific community due to skepticism of the ability of a bolide impact to generate sufficient melt. A model of formation due to mantle plumes (upwelling) was persistent for many years, however, it has since been abandoned due to its contradictory prediction of sequences of extension versus the observed cross cutting relationships.

Downwelling

In the downwelling model, mantle downwelling, possibly due to mantle convection, causes compression and thickening of the crust, creating the compressional elements of tessera terrain. Isostatic rebound occurs due to the crustal thickening. After downwelling ends, a delamination event within the mantle produces extensional elements of tessera. This model does not currently explain tessera's location within crustal plateaus, and instead predicts a domical shape.

Lava pond via giant impact
In the lava pond via giant impact model, melt due to a bolide impact on a thin lithosphere rises to the surface to form a lava pond. Convection throughout the lava pond resulted in surface deformation that created tessera terrain. Isostatic rebound of the solidified pond creates a crustal plateau structure. This model does not currently explain how convection could transmit enough force to deform several kilometers of brittle material.

Pulsating continents

In the pulsating continents model, differentiated, low density crust survives early global subduction events forming continental regions. These regions undergo compression due to heating from the surrounding mantle, forming the compressional features of tessera, such as fold and thrust belts, and basin dome terrain. After sufficient crustal thickening has occurred, new lithosphere is generated causing gravitational collapse, producing the extensional features of tessera, such as extensive grabens. During this collapse, decompression causes partial melting, producing the intratessera volcanism seen within the larger regions of tessera terrain. This model requires that the material comprising tessera terrain is continental in nature. Future missions to Venus to sample surface compositions are necessary to support this model. This model does not currently explain how a global subduction event could cause the delamination of the entire mantle lithosphere, leaving only low density crust behind.

Variety of tessera terrain
Individual patterns of tessera terrain record the variations in interactions of the mantle with local regional stresses. This variation manifests itself in a wide array of diverse terrain types. Multiple types of sampled tessera terrain are below, however, they are not meant as a classification scheme, and instead emphasize the variety of terrain types.

Fold Terrain is easily recognizable by its well defined linear fabrics. This type of terrain is composed of long ridges and valleys, greater than 100 km long, that are cross cut by minor extensional fractures that run perpendicular to the fold axes of the ridges. This likely formed due to unidirectional contraction.

Lava Flow Terrain is named such due to its resemblance to Pahoehoe flows found on Earth, with long curving ridges. It is thought that this terrain may be formed due to displacement and deformation due to movement of the material beneath these crustal pieces.

Ribbon Terrain is characterized by ribbons and folds that are typically orthogonal to one another. Ribbons are long and narrow extensional troughs that are separated by narrow ridges. Ribbon terrain can be found both in large crustal plateaus and within tessera inliers.

S-C Terrain is named such due to its geometric similarity to S-C tectonic fabrics on Earth. It consists of two main structures: synchronous folds and small, 5 to 20 km long graben that cross cut the folds perpendicularly. Unlike many other types of tessera terrain, S-C terrain indicates a simple, rather than complex deformation history in which deformation due to widespread motion on Venus is widely distributed. This type of terrain also indicates that strike-slip movement on Venus's surface is possible.

Basin and Dome Terrain, also known as honeycomb terrain, consists of curved ridges and troughs that form a pattern analogous to an egg carton. These structures represent multiple phases of deformation, and are considered the most complex appearing style of tessera. Basin and dome terrain is typically found within the center of crustal plateaus.

Star Terrain is composed of multiple graben and fractures that trend in many directions, but radiate in a star-like pattern. This pattern is thought to be due to doming underneath previously deformed and fractured areas, in which the local uplift causes the radiating pattern.

Geology of Venus"," Tessera (Venus) Tessera, also called tesserae, is a term used by archaeologists to describe the small, flat, roughly square stones that were used as votes in democratic elections in the ancient Roman Republic. In the Roman constitutional tradition, citizens had several rights and duties. One of these was the right to vote. In the early Republic, voting was done by a show of hands, but as the population grew, this method became unwieldy. By the end of the 4th century BC, voting by ballot (tesserae) was introduced. Each voter would write the name of the candidate he was voting for on a small piece of wood, usually wax-coated, called a tessera. In order to prevent fraud, the tessera was marked with a letter or symbol so that illiterate citizens could cast the correct vote. The marked tessera was then placed in a large pile with those of other voters. The votes were then counted and the candidate with the majority of votes was elected. A similar method was used for voting on laws and other matters of state. However, the voters in this case used a different type of tessera, called a ballotarium, which had two sides, both of which could be written on. The voter would write ""Aye"" or ""No"" on one side and then turn the tessera over and write the name of the law on the other side.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,45252110,0.11645569620253164,0.09473684210526316,0.2379136881122584,0.11370716510903427,3,2,0,0,6,1,1,0,0,0,0.22105996813556494,0.026391664551686372,0.0033140016570008283,0.02702702702702703,10,1,5,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,1,9,0,1,1
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Extermination of Evil"", the article should at least have 250 words","is a set of five paintings depicting traditional Asian deities banishing evil. The paintings are collectively listed as a national treasure of Japan and held at the Nara national museum.

Overview
The paintings are thought to have been created during the 12th century, during the reign of Emperor Go-Shirakawa in the Heian period; they may have also been produced during the Kamakura period. The calligrapher is thought to be the same on the five scrolls as on the hell scroll and the demon of punishment, which were produced at roughly the same time. They are thought to have originally been a single handscroll, known as the ""second edition of the Masuda family hell scroll"", that was stored in the Rengeō-in Temple (now Sanjūsangen-dō). The paintings depict five benevolent deities in combat against evil, as represented by demons; the deities come from several cultures, including contemporary Japanese, Chinese, and Indian. They are thought to be associated with the hell transformation screens then used in Nara for repentance ceremonies at the end of each year, where the devout recited the names of the buddhas at Heijō Palace.

The paintings were designated National Treasures of Japan on 6 June 1985, with the accession number 1106. They are located at the Nara National Museum in Nara, Nara Prefecture.

Works

Tenkeisei

Tenkeisei (天刑星, literally meaning ""the star [that metes out] heavenly punishment""), or the god of heavenly punishment, is a deity from the Chinese tradition of yin and yang. Originally a demon, he later took on a role in Vajrayana prayers. In the painting he is depicted fighting and consuming Gozu tennō, an ox-headed deity worshipped at the Gion shrine (present day Yasaka) in Kyoto (京都市, Kyōto-shi). The painting measures  and has the accession number 1106-1.

Sendan kendatsuba (Candana Gandharva)

Sendan kendatsuba (栴檀乾闥婆, Sanskrit name Candana Gandharva) is one of the eight guardians of Buddhist law and one of the 33 manifestations of Avalokiteśvara. He is derived from an Indian patron god of music and believed to protect young people from the fifteen malevolent deities. He is drawn similar to in the Dôji mandara. The painting measures  and has the accession number 1106-2.

Shinchū

The divine insect (神虫, Shinchū) is a deity depicted as a silkworm moth. It was known for miracles. The painting measures  and has the accession number 1106-3.

Shōki

Shōki (鍾馗) is a deity told in Buddhist setsuwa (oral tales) to have protected Emperor Xuanzong of Tang. In the painting, Shōki is portrayed with a thick beard and large eyes. Wearing a black hat, robe, and tall boots, it is depicted as stabbing a demon. The painting measures  and has the accession number 1106-4.

Bishamonten

Bishamonten (毘沙門天) is the Japanese name for Vaiśravaṇa, the chief of the four heavenly kings. In the image, he is depicted protecting followers of the Lotus Sutra from evil while carrying a bow. His equipment is similar to that found in Chinese paintings from the Tang and Song dynasties. The painting measures  and has the accession number 1106-5.

Paintings of deities"," Extermination of Evil Extermination of Evil is a concept that was introduced into the Catholic Church by Pope Pius XII in the mid-20th century. The concept was further developed by the Second Vatican Council, in the 1960s. The idea is that since the Fall of Man, the world is in a fallen state, and must be restored to its original condition by an act of divine intervention. This intervention would be the final act in the drama of salvation, and would mark the end of the present world order, and the beginning of the eternal state. In the interim, the Church is called to be the ""salt of the earth"", the ""light of the world"", and to be the ""seed of the kingdom"". The concept is related to the idea of the ""kingdom of God"", which is also referred to as the ""kingdom of heaven"". The kingdom of God is the sphere of God's rule, and the concept has been developed in the New Testament, particularly by Jesus and the apostles. The idea of the kingdom of God has also been developed by the Catholic Church, particularly in the modern period. The concept of the kingdom of God is related to the idea of the ""kingdom of Christ"", which is the idea of the final state of the world, after the return of Christ and the final judgment. The concept of the kingdom of Christ is related to the idea of the ""kingdom of the saints"", which is the idea of the intermediate state, after the fall of the present world order, but before the final state. The concept of the kingdom of God is also related to the idea of the ""kingdom of nature"", which is the idea that the world is a kingdom, and that the world is a natural entity, which is governed by natural laws. The concept of the kingdom of nature is related to the idea of the ""kingdom of grace"", which is the idea that the world is a kingdom, and that the world is a supernatural entity, which is governed by supernatural laws.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,33032931,0.05063291139240506,0.09473684210526316,0.10807519195128408,0.29906542056074764,9,8,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0.09041528478810561,0.030307458040272864,0.0017950842308754487,0.018427518427518427,16,0,4,5,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,1,19,1,1,1
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Nevadaplano"", the article should at least have 250 words","Nevadaplano was a high plateau that covered parts of southwestern North America during the late Mesozoic and early Cenozoic, located in the present-day US states of Idaho, Nevada, Utah and possibly others. It most likely formed during the Cretaceous as a consequence of subduction dynamics and may have reached elevations of  and more. It was flanked on the west by the Sierra Nevada, which was traversed by various valleys that came down from the Nevadaplano. Closed basins and numerous volcanic calderas covered the relatively flat Nevadaplano; large volcanic eruptions distributed ignimbrites over the plateau and down the valleys draining it.

During the Miocene, changes in the tectonic regime caused a collapse and dismemberment of the Nevadaplano. Tectonic extension gave rise to the Basin and Range province and separated the Sierra Nevada-Great Valley block from the Nevadaplano, forming today's landscape.

Research history 

The existence of the Nevadaplano was proposed in 2004 by DeCelles and named after the Altiplano high plateau of South America. It is also known as the ""Great Basin Altiplano"". Unlike the present-day Andean Altiplano and Tibetan plateau, the Nevadaplano was dismembered during the Cenozoic and thus its structure and evolution are poorly understood.

Geologic history 

The Nevadaplano probably formed as part of either the Sevier or the Laramide Orogeny during the Mesozoic and persisted into the Paleogene. Its growth began either in the Cretaceous or the Jurassic, when significant tectonic shortening took place behind the Sevier orogen. Similar to the present-day Altiplano in South America, the combination of an arid climate, tectonic contraction, weak erosion and the accumulation of volcanic rocks both in and below the crust helped raise the Nevadaplano during the Cretaceous, when flat subduction was taking place. Later its southern part was probably overprinted by the Laramide Orogeny when volcanism shifted far to the east. The exact geologic evolution of the Nevadaplano is controversial, however.

The Nevadaplano underwent extensional tectonics during the Cenozoic in a multi-step process. One stage occurred in the Eocene-Oligocene towards the end of subduction, when subduction steepened again and slab rollback decreased the tectonic forces. It is possible that at that time volcanic activity swept southwestward, away from the volcanoes of central Nevada to the Sierra. This was accompanied by uplift that may have peaked at the arrival of the Yellowstone hotspot.

The plateau overrode the heat source of the East Pacific Rise about 28 million years ago. After a delay, east–west extension and northwestward shearing set in with major extension underway by 16-17 million years ago. The heat flow from the Yellowstone hotspot facilitated the collapse process. Only during the Miocene did the surface of the high plateau to significantly lose elevation. During the Miocene the Sierra Nevada-Great Valley block separated from the Nevadaplano and was tilted to the west along the Sierra Escarpment, beheading a number of westward-going drainages in the process. Former drainages of the Nevadaplano were buried by volcanic rocks and disrupted by tectonic processes. Farther east, the dismemberment of the drainages may have created suitable environments for the evolution of sucker fish. Another stage in the Neogene is the well-known Basin and Range extension, triggered by changes in the plate boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate. Presently, relic surfaces around the Middle Fork Feather River valley and the high elevations of the northern Basin and Range may be considered remnants of the Nevadaplano.

The Nevadaplano during its existence 

The Nevadaplano was located in present-day Nevada and Utah, at the location of the present-day Great Basin, and may have extended from what is present-day central Idaho in the north either to Sonora or southern Nevada in the south. It was a high plateau consisting of a peneplain and reached a width of . Isotope analysis indicates that the Nevadaplano stood at high elevations, probably higher than or comparable to the then-Sierra Nevada. The elevation of the Nevadaplano exceeded , but the exact value is controversial. It was not entirely flat, and there is evidence of basins at its western margin although the relief of the Nevadaplano was probably smaller than that of the Altiplano.

The eastern Nevadaplano probably drained to internal basins such as the Uinta Basin, the Western Interior Seaway and westward to the Pacific Ocean. A drainage divide extended from the Mogollon Highlands in the south through the Kingman Uplift into the Nevadaplano. There is some uncertainty in the drainage directions across the Nevadaplano, with some evidence interpreted as indicating that drainage divides shifted over time and that the divide between Nevada and Idaho was offset along a Neoproterozoic lineament. Among the reconstructed drainages are the Tyee and Princeton Rivers from what is present-day north-central Idaho to present-day Oregon and northern California, the Idaho River also from present-day north-central Idaho to the Green River basin and the California River from present-day southernmost California to the Uinta Basin. The northernmost among these rivers may have formed the northern boundary of the Nevadaplano. Some closed drainages also existed, such as in the Elko basin, which formed in response to tectonic deformation.

Some normal faulting took place within the Nevadaplano, along with the exposure of core complexes, and generated isolated basins. This may have created regional basins in the late Cretaceous similar to those that lie in the present-day Altiplano-Puna region, and which include the Sheep Pass Formation basin and the long-lived Elko Basin. Lake sediments and volcanic rocks accumulated in these basins. The formation of these basins may have been an early stage of the collapse of the Nevadaplano.

Geographical and geological boundaries 

West of the Nevadaplano stood the Sierra Nevada, which was volcanically active until 80 million years ago and featured exposed batholiths from former volcanism. Its exact elevation at the time is unclear, with alternate models proposing either that it had already reached a height similar to today's Sierra Nevada or that it rose to present-day height in the Miocene and Pliocene. Alternatively, the Luning-Fencemaker fold-and-thrust belt may have formed the western boundary.

It probably did not constitute a drainage divide; various east–west trending valleys cut across the Sierra Nevada at that time. Presently filled with volcanic and sedimentary rocks, these valleys were  wide,  deep with flat and deeply weathered bottoms. Among these valleys are the Nine Hill and Soda Springs valleys in the Lake Tahoe region and the Stanislaus, Mokelumne and Cataract paleochannels in the Sonora Pass region. There is more evidence for paleovalleys in the northern Sierra Nevada than in the southern, which may either indicate that evidence of cross-Sierra drainage was removed in its southern sector or that the southern Sierra was higher than the central and northern Sierra at the time of the Nevadaplano. Some of these rivers may have been large enough to allow sharks to reach Nevada. The rivers flowing through these valleys deposited the placer gold deposits of California, as part of intense westward sediment transport.

Remnants of the Laramide uplands, the Chusca erg or the Sevier fold-and-thrust belt were located east of the Nevadaplano. The boundary was located at a region corresponding to the present-day Wasatch, Santaquin and Canyon Ranges. A relatively short distance may have separated it there from the Western Interior Seaway. The region of what today is northern Nevada during the Oligocene may have been a gently tilted or closed plateau. To the south, the California River may have separated the Nevadaplano from an analogous high plateau to the south, called ""Mexicoplano"" or ""Arizonaplano"". The Colorado Plateau was either to the east of the Nevadaplano or else formed an integral part of the plateau.

Geology 

During the Miocene, volcanic activity covered the Nevadaplano with lahars, lava flows and volcanic sediments. In central Nevada and western Utah, at least 71 calderas located at high elevation erupted ignimbrites which propagated for over  westward and across former valleys in the Sierra Nevada, filling them in during the process. In particular, the 28.9 million year old Campbell Creek tuff covered an area of  and propagated far east and west of its source area.

The underlying crust had a sialic composition and reached thicknesses of . It consisted of metamorphic rocks and may have contained core complexes like these currently exposed in the Pequop Mountains of Nevada, as well as batholiths like the Idaho Batholith.

Ecosystems and climate 

Based on the fossils found in the Sheep Pass Formation, the Nevadaplano likely had a cold high-elevation climate. Located in the rain shadow of the Sierra Nevada, it was dry, and therefore experienced only weak erosion. The rain shadow extended east of the Nevadaplano. However, precipitation was enough to cut large valleys into the Sierra Nevada, perhaps aided by the then-warm climate. Pulses of erosion may have occurred during Paleogene climate disturbances, such as the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum. Vegetation with temperate climate affinities may have migrated from the Nevadaplano to California when the climate cooled during the Oligocene, founding the temperate forest communities of California.

Evidence suggests that lakes and alluvial fans existed on the Nevadaplano, the Sheep Pass Formation constitutes the remnants of such landforms. It is not clear however if the Sheep Pass lake system was at high elevation. Fossils of anurans, birds, bivalves, crustaceans, frogs, lizards, mammals, molluscs, ostracods and snakes have been found there, as well as evidence of algae, charophytes, plants and microbial mats. There are also traces of physical events such as debris flows, periodic desiccation and storms. Lakes formed during the disassembly of the Nevadaplano as well, including these where the Truckee Formation diatomites were emplaced in.

Paleogene orogenies"," Nevadaplano Nevadaplano is a musical instrument made by Italian luthier Mario Maccaferri in 1929. The instrument's body is made of two thin sheets of steel, with a ""sandwich"" of nylon webbing and a finish of baked enamel. The name ""nevadaplano"" comes from the Spanish word nevada, meaning ""snowfall,"" and the Italian word plano, meaning ""flat,"" referring to the two opposing flat sides of the body. The nevadaplano's design is a mixture of the technologies used in the bowl-back mandolins (the round, f-hole sound holes, and the bridge) and flat-top guitars (the flat top and the guitar-like tailpiece). The bridge is similar to that of a Gibson Les Paul guitar, with a break angle of about 45° and a string-through design. The instrument's sound is characterized by a bright, bell-like tone. The open, airy sound and fast attack are due to the lightweight construction, while the sustain is relatively short. The instrument's volume and projection are not as great as a traditional acoustic guitar, but it can be amplified to achieve greater volume. The nevadaplano was produced in several models, including the basic model, the ""super nevadaplano,"" and the ""nevadaplano equipped with an amplifying pick-up and an electric volume control."" The basic model was a non-amplified instrument with a natural finish and a simple tailpiece. The ""super nevadaplano"" was an amplified instrument with a sunburst finish, a ""bat-wing"" tailpiece, and a built-in electric pickup. The ""nevadaplano equipped with an amplifying pick-up and an electric volume control"" was similar to the ""super nevadaplano,"" but with a conventional tailpiece and a control knob for the pickup. The nevadaplano was produced in very limited numbers, and is considered a rare and collectible instrument. The instrument was produced in the Italian workshops of Mario Maccaferri from the late 1920s to the early 1930s.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,68764165,0.10905550146056475,0.11578947368421053,0.25557524286674405,0.21806853582554517,0,13,0,0,2,1,1,0,0,1,0.22007208697538377,0.025920916400043074,0.0030378348522507597,0.0171990171990172,10,0,11,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,1,26,0,1,1
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Cruising (driving)"", the article should at least have 250 words","Cruising is a social activity that primarily consists of driving a car. Cruising can be an expression of the freedom of possessing a driver's license. Cruising is distinguished from regular driving by the social and recreational nature of the activity, which is characterized by an impulsively random, often aimless course. A popular route (or ""strip"") is often the focus of cruising. ""Cruise nights"" are evenings during which cars drive slowly. A cruise can be a meeting of car enthusiasts at a predetermined location, organised predominantly through the internet (in recent times) but also largely through mobile phone, word of mouth or simply by a cruise being established enough that it becomes a regular event.

Some ethnic groups identify with lifestyles related to cruising, such as the Hispanos of New Mexico, Chicanos, and Mexican-Americans of the Southwestern United States along U.S. Route 66. Meets, like those at lowrider and auto shows, are popular across the United States and worldwide in large part due to these ethnic communities.

United States

History
There is no clear-cut date when casual driving turned into cruising along a specific route, although it generally began in the years after World War II with youths of Mexican heritage driving lowriders in Southern California towns, and it rapidly became a popular teenage activity.

Cruising culture was an evolution of old traditions of strolling down Main Street or around the town square. Although cruising was predominantly boys showing off their cars (ostensibly to meet girls), groups of girls joined in cruising as well. One appeal of cruising was that youths could evade the supervision of parents and family.

Driving slowly down long, straight streets, preferably with many traffic lights to increase opportunities to talk to other cruisers or pedestrians, was only one part of cruising. Cruisers would also gather in parking lots, particularly those of drive-ins. As a Tucson journalist noted, ""Cruisers, like moths and June bugs, eventually congregate around brightly lighted areas."" Cruisers were also apt to arrange impromptu races with other cruisers.

As early as the 1960s, some towns established ordinances to prohibit driving through parking lots without stopping and the police issued tickets for loitering and curfew violations. Increasingly, cruisers would travel from wider areas to gather on popular strips, with police viewing these visitors as troublemakers. Reports of clashes between groups of cruisers began to appear in local newspapers.

However, cruising continued to remain popular, with wildly painted vans and pickup trucks joining hot rods and muscle cars in the 1970s. In many locales, there was a generally positive relationship with law enforcement. Racing in populated areas was discouraged by police surveillance and traffic, but cruisers engaged in other games such as mooning onlookers, laying rubber when a signal turned green, and ""chinese fire drills"" in which all occupants of a car stopped at a light would get out, run around the car, and jump back in.

There was some decline in cruising in the 1970s, possibly connected to the rise of gas prices but also due to a growing change in community attitudes toward cruising. The San Francisco Bay Area had a ""cruising summit"" in 1977 for area police to discuss ""our mutual problems with cruising"". The gathering numbers of vehicles and increases in tensions and violence led many communities to begin looking for ways to discourage cruising, despite many adults retaining a permissive acceptance of cruising with nostalgia for their own cruising days. Although business merchants and shoppers had been inconvenienced for years by cruisers, tolerance had dissipated and law enforcement was encouraged to step in.

During the summer of 1974, Los Angeles police began cracking down on cruising, first by banning parking along Van Nuys Boulevard and then in August making it a one-way street. The following summer, as many as 15,000 youths from as far away as San Diego converged on Van Nuys, encouraged by local disc jockeys. A similar crackdown on Whittier Boulevard led to the formation of a cruiser's rights group. Police barricaded portions of Whittier in an attempt to disrupt cruising, but even local adults objected to this practice. Other measures were tried, such as shutting portions of Whittier down completely at night. Cruisers moved to Highland Avenue, resulting in the arrest of 170 during the second weekend of September 1979. The following summer, a section of Van Nuys was closed after 9 p.m. The rationale for the blockade was that it only required fifteen police to close the road, but they would need at least 150 officers to police the 15,000 cruisers who had gathered there. 

As quickly as one strip became unusable, cruisers would find new sites. It became a persistent battle between authorities and cruisers. In 1982, the California state legislature passed a law that gave cities express sanction to shut down streets being used for cruising, when driving ""for purposes of socializing and assembling interferes with the conduct of businesses, wastes precious energy resources, impedes the progress of general traffic and emergency vehicles, and promotes the generation of local concentrations of air pollution and undesirable noise levels"".

Efforts to stop cruising continued, with increasing blockades and mass arrests. In 1985, random checkpoints began to appear, with police stopping cars passing the spot more than once in a given timeframe. Computers were added in 1988 to help track the cars. New curfews for minors were established. Cruising in southern California was generally suppressed by 1990. Other regions used tactics similar to southern California's, with similar mixed results. Police in Galveston, Texas began arresting cruisers, but had to back down in the face of parental complaints. Joplin, Missouri attempted a ban on cruising, but had to repeal it. Merchants in Portland, Oregon complained that they were losing business because of the crackdowns. Multiple towns across the U.S. adopted the checkpoint system.

Other towns tried creative alternatives, such as Laurel, Mississippi and Princeton, West Virginia, which both channeled cruisers onto routes that would not interfere with local businesses. Setting aside parking lots specifically for cruisers was tried in Cedar Rapids, Iowa and Columbus, Indiana. The town of Big Stone Gap, Virginia chose to embrace cruising, awarding prizes for the best customized vehicles.

Cities continue to struggle with the problems of cruising into the 2000s. In 2006, Milwaukee, Wisconsin even explored letting police confiscate cruisers' cars. 

While communities try to prevent impromptu cruising, multiple towns have embraced organized cruising revivals. The Woodward Dream Cruise occurs on the third Saturday in August along the original cruising strip in Detroit's northern suburbs. The event is a tribute to the classic Woodward cruisers and attracts approximately 1 million people and 40,000 muscle cars, street rods, and custom, collector, and special interest vehicles. Waukegan, Illinois, has an annual summer cruising festival called ""Scoopin' Genesee"". and Modesto, California celebrates ""Graffiti Summer"" with an annual cruise parade. Renton, Washington hosts ""Cruz the Loop"" each summer, and in 2020 erected a sculpture to honor cruising the loop.

Well-known strips
One of the oldest cruising strips in East Los Angeles is located on Whittier Boulevard. Cruising on this strip became a popular pastime among lowriders during the 1940s before spreading to surrounding neighborhoods in the 1950s.  Van Nuys Boulevard in the central San Fernando Valley has been a popular cruising strip since the 1950s; the 1979 film Van Nuys Blvd. depicted the cruising culture on the strip. In the late 1970s, the Wednesday night cruise on Van Nuys attracted up to 40,000 cars. Sunset Boulevard was another popular cruise strip.

Perhaps the most famous cruising strip (or main drag), however, is McHenry Avenue in Modesto, California.  The cruising culture of the late 1950s and early 1960s was depicted in the film American Graffiti. The film was set (but not actually filmed) in director George Lucas's home town of Modesto, which also hosts an annual ""Graffiti Summer"" celebration in the film's honor.

Cruising in Detroit was popular from the 1950s to the 1970s in the city's northern suburbs along M-1 (Woodward Avenue), from Ferndale north to Pontiac. Cruising along Woodward reached its peak in the mid-1960s, with muscle car competitions that were covered by journalists from Car and Driver, Motor Trend, and CBS World News Roundup. Other popular cruising strips in the Detroit area include US 24 (Telegraph Road) from 12 Mile Road in Southfield to Michigan Avenue in Dearborn, and M-3 (Gratiot Avenue) on the East Side.

United Kingdom

Description
There are two main types of cruise: regular cruises, also known as meets, and one-off cruises.  The events that take place are similar; cars meet in car parks, park up or cruise (drive slowly) around the car park while people socialise – often meeting people from cruise websites, show off their cars and admire others' cars. If there is enough space there are often drag races, burnouts, and doughnuts.

Meets
A meet is a regular gathering, usually weekly or monthly, where the time and place is freely publicised and well known. It is becoming more common these days for these events to be referred to incorrectly as cruises.

One-off cruises
A one-off cruise is an event organised by a particular group of people or club which would usually be advertised through cruise websites.  The final destination of the cruise is often kept secret; it is known only to the convoy leaders in an attempt to keep the cruise unknown to the police until there are a large enough numbers of people at the cruise to make it difficult to disperse.

One-off cruises tend to be larger than meets, but larger meets may have magazine attendance.  This type of cruise is increasing in recent times due to increased police interest in regular, established cruises.

Some large cruises operate a ""convoy-only"" policy.

Locations
Cruises are generally held in retail parks due to the large open car parks needed to accommodate high attendance numbers (sometimes more than 500 cars). Naturally, with many cruises situated in retail parks, most cruise locations are also in close proximity to fast food restaurants such as McDonald's or Burger King.

Cruising and the law 

Although cruising is often not a crime in itself, there are many illegal activities associated with it, and as such cruises are often monitored by the police or even closed. The most commonly cited reasons for breaking up cruises are breach of the peace, caused by loud exhausts and sound systems disturbing local residents, and dangerous driving (such as street racing, burnouts and doughnuts). Police also claim that cruises are used as cover for drug dealing and are attended by stolen or otherwise illegal cars. More recently, police have been using ASBO laws which enable them to seize and impound cars if anti-social behaviour is taking place or if a group refuses to disperse from an area.

As a result of increased police powers, legal cruises have been established such as Weston Wheels, although these tend to resemble car shows with camping, music stages and trade stalls.  This passive, organised nature often does not satisfy the desires of cruisers, so illegal cruising continues.

Many city councils have successfully placed court injunctions to prevent boy racers parking cars in areas that have been popular with them.

Magazines 

Cruising and modifying have long been represented in the commercial magazines Max Power, Fast Car and Redline.  In mid-2006, Max Power, the magazine that brought cruises to the forefront, abandoned the scene – preferring to concentrate on ""dream"" cars such as Nissan Skylines. Long-time rival Fast Car assumed Max Power's position and now covers multiple cruises across the UK in each edition.

Cruising is done along a highway, usually on a weekend or holiday, when the traffic is light. The idea is to drive along the highway for the purpose of relaxation and sightseeing. A cruise is usually a long drive on a freeway or other road, where the driver and passengers are enjoying music from the radio, singing, talking, or other forms of entertainment. Cruising is generally considered a safe and legal activity. However, it can be illegal in some areas, and it can be dangerous if the driver is not alert. Cruising can be done with any vehicle, but it is usually done with a car or truck. Some people like to cruise on motorcycles or scooters. Cruising is a popular activity for teenagers and young adults. It is also a popular activity for people who are retired. Cruising can be done at any time of day or night, but it is usually done on weekends or holidays, when the traffic is light. There are many different types of cruises. Some cruises are long drives along a highway. Other cruises are shorter drives along a city street or country road. Some cruises are done for the purpose of relaxation, while others are done for the purpose of sightseeing. Cruising is a popular activity in many countries. In the United States, cruising is a common activity in many states, including California, Florida, Texas, and New York. In Australia, cruising is a common activity in many states, including New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania. In Canada, cruising is a common activity in many provinces, including Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec. There are many different reasons for cruising. Some people cruise for the purpose of relaxation. Others cruise for the purpose of sightseeing. Some people cruise as a form of exercise.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,2473207,0.08894970920287378,0.21052631578947367,0.2157367852363881,0.2803738317757009,7,13,1,0,10,1,0,0,0,0,0.2149898100878111,0.028631292700269265,0.006628003314001657,0.025798525798525797,15,9,11,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,14,0,24,1,1,1
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Lloyd Robson"", the article should at least have 250 words","Leslie Lloyd Robson (1931-1990) was an Australian historian and academic at the University of Melbourne. He pioneered new techniques of quantitative history, and wrote A History of Tasmania, a two volume work on the history of Australia's island state.

Early life 
Robson was born in Ulverstone, Tasmania, on 24 July 1931. His parents, George Leslie Robson, and Laurel Grace (née Revell) were farmers, and Robson grew up on a farm at West Pine, near Penguin. He was educated at Devonport High School and the University of Tasmania, where he completed a Bachelor of Arts in 1953, and a Master of Arts in 1955.

During the 1950s Robson undertook postgraduate study at the University of London, where he met and married his first wife, Margaret Ilona Horden. He completed a Ph.D. at the Australian National University in 1963, supervised by Manning Clark and W. D. Borrie. His thesis examined convicts transported to New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land in 1787–1852. It was later published as The Convict Settlers of Australia (1965).

Academic career 

Robson worked at the University of Melbourne from 1964 until his retirement. There he taught mostly Australian history, and supervised students undertaking higher degrees by research. He pioneered techniques of quantitative history, as evidenced in his doctoral thesis and his later work, The First AIF (1970).

He was a significant protagonist in the Australian history wars, which debated the interpretation of the colonisation of Australia, especially in regards to the impact on Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders.

Later life 
Robson died of cancer aged 59, on 22 August 1990 in Fitzroy, Victoria. The funeral was held at the Uniting Church, Penguin, Tasmania, and he was buried in the old cemetery overlooking the town.

Burials in Tasmania"," Lloyd Robson (born 30 June 1943) is an English retired professional footballer. Robson was born in Newcastle upon Tyne. He attended the Laing School in Newcastle and was a promising young athlete. He was a member of the Gosforth & District AC team that won the English Schools' Athletic Association national cross country title in 1961, and the following year he was selected to run for England in the International Schools' Match against Scotland. He played football for Gosforth Central Park and in 1961 he became one of the first intake of apprentices at Arsenal, turning professional in 1964. He made his debut in the Football League in March 1965 in a 3–1 win against Liverpool, and that season he helped Arsenal to win the Second Division. He was an ever-present in 1966–67 as Arsenal finished second in the First Division, and was also ever-present in 1967–68 when they again finished second. In 1968–69 he was a member of the side that won the League and the FA Cup, although he missed the latter part of the season after sustaining a broken leg. He was back in the side in 1969–70 as Arsenal retained the League title. He was also an ever-present in 1970–71 and 1971–72, although in 1972–73 he was replaced at right-back by Terry Paine and only made three appearances.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Sidney Poitier Black and White: Sidney Poitier's Emergence in the 1960s as a Black Icon"", the article should at least have 250 words","Sidney Poitier Black and White: Sidney Poitier's Emergence in the 1960s as a Black Icon is a 2020 biography of Sidney Poitier written by Philip Powers. 

Powers is also the author of First Films Directing 1.0, which explores the context and critical opinions of David Cronenberg, Dennis Hopper, Anne Bancroft, Richard Benjamin, Amy Heckerling and Nicholas Meyer's first films.

Summary
In this biography, Powers explores Sidney Poitier’s rise to Hollywood success against the backdrop of racial adversity faced by people of colour within the United States. The book incorporates numerous sources, including newspaper articles from the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, to provide context and insight into attitudes at the time. It also draws parallels to the racial challenges experienced and spotlighted in the 21st century to emphasise the importance of Poitier’s journey in inspiring black Americans to stand up for their rights. 

The book commences by outlining Poitier’s early life and his beginnings in the film industry, linking the roles he portrayed to his childhood and the lessons instilled in him by his father. Following Poitier’s “progress as an actor [which] was painfully slow for many years”, a picture emerges of a hard-working Poitier who joined the army, opened a restaurant, worked long hours in the kitchen and considered brick laying and cab driving to make ends meet and later, support his family. Despite the struggle for roles, Poitier was, for the most part, selective in the characters he would portray as he tried to balance “making a living as an actor, becoming as popular as a white actor and staying true to a representation of people with dark skin who can do anything a white man can do”.

Powers discusses the barriers faced by Poitier including the lack of representation of black people within films and the subsequent lack of roles, the pressure to sign a loyalty oath in exchange for work, and the political climate in which Poitier’s films were released. The book goes on to explore Poitier’s associations with Stanley Kramer, Spencer Tracy, Martin Luther King and Harry Belafonte and the way in which each of these influenced and shaped his career. The details of these relationships describe the stepping-stones to Poitier’s directorial debut, Buck and the Preacher. Concluding with an analysis of Buck and the Preacher, Powers provides insight into the critical reception of the film and illustrates how the film, often perceived as a flop, marked the beginning of Poitier’s success as a director.

Racism"," Black and White: Sidney Poitier's Emergence in the 1960s as a Black Icon The first African-American film star to win a Best Actor Oscar, Sidney Poitier (1927–2022) played a pivotal role in the emergence of Black icons in Hollywood films. He made his film debut in the 1950 film No Way Out, and his breakthrough came with his first leading role in the 1955 film Blackboard Jungle. His work as a civil rights activist and as a Bahamian citizen also played a role in the early 1960s movement for the independence of the Bahamian colony from the British Empire. In the early 1960s, Poitier's work as a film, stage, and television actor began to receive awards and critical acclaim, and he became the first African-American male to win a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor for his work in the 1964 film Lilies of the Field. His other major roles during this period included A Raisin in the Sun (1961), Pressure Point (1962), and In the Heat of the Night (1967). Poitier's emergence as a Black icon was influenced by several factors, including his personal life, his Bahamian citizenship, his civil rights activism, and his work in the arts. His work as an actor and as a citizen of the Bahamas helped to break down barriers for Black actors and to change the way Black people were portrayed in the media.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Operation Claw"", the article should at least have 250 words","Operation Claw () was a joint Swedish–American operation, with Norwegian support, that was carried out at Lillehammer shortly after the German capitulation by the end of World War II. Thirty-five German intelligence specialists were transferred along with various equipment first to Sweden and then to U.S. camps in occupied Germany through an agreement between the Americans and the German High Command of the Wehrmacht in Norway.

The intelligence material from Operation Claw, among it a Soviet codebook, became very useful for the Americans during the Cold War. Operation Claw was controversial both when it happened and afterwards. In 1945, it was controversial that the Americans operated in what was seen as a British controlled country, and that they secured information about its ally the Soviet Union, in cooperation with neutral Sweden. In later years,  a hypothesis that the Norwegian resistance fighter Kai Holst's sudden death in June 1945 was related to his involvement in the Operation Claw has been put forward by among others the historian Tore Pryser.

Background 
Even before the war in Europe ended the various allied states had begun the search for German scientists and other German expertise. Signals intelligence had been vital during World War II and especially the British work with breaking the German codes, from the Enigma had been of huge importance. The Yalta Conference in February 1945 had revealed conflicts of interest between the western allied nations on one side and the Soviet Union and the relation was severely strained.

American intelligence organisations were very interested in German intelligence experts knowledge of the Soviet Union and immediately after the war in Europe ended they began to cooperate with the German Major General Reinhard Gehlen and his organisation Fremde Heere Ost (FHO) which had led German intelligence on the Eastern Front. It was part of an organized effort to obtain as much German intelligence information and personnel as possible; the operation had the name Target Intelligence Committee (TICOM).

The war was however still fought in East-Asia, the US and the Soviet Union were still allies and the Americans were counting on Soviet assistance in the war against Japan. The allies had designated Norway as part of the British sphere of influence. Both for the US and the neutral Sweden the operation was thus very sensitive and was conducted in great secrecy.

Swedish–American cooperation

In the Wehrmacht camp at Lillehammer a group of 35 German experts on signals intelligence were gathered. They had been working on the Eastern Front against Soviet forces and had an archive and extensive knowledge about Soviet affairs. This was knowledge the Western Allies, and especially the Americans, wanted and that probably also were of use during the Cold War.

In cooperation with the American intelligence organisation Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and with knowledge and support from the Norwegian legation in Stockholm agents for the Swedish intelligence organisation C-byrån traveled together with two Norwegian intelligence specialists to Lillehammer on May 9 and 10, 1945. The German group of experts were taken out of the camp and transported to Sweden. After a few weeks in Sweden they were on June 12 flown from Torslanda Airport close to Gothenburg to US occupied Germany and were interned in an American military camp at Wiesbaden.

The transfer to Sweden of the German experts at Lillehammer, that OSS called Operation Claw, was directed from the highest level. From the U.S. side the leader of OSS, Major General William J. Donovan was involved, from the Swedish side the chief of the Defense Staff, Major General Carl August Ehrensvärd. The famous Swedish police director Harry Söderman was also involved from the Swedish side.

British–Norwegian raid of June 1945

More than a month after the German capitulation, a British led search supported by Norwegian personnel  was executed in order to find people from Gestapo and other German key personnel that tried to hide among ordinary soldiers in German military camps. The search force that Kai Holst and other Norwegians were assisting were soon aware of that a number of German key personnel had been removed in the Swedish–American operation a month earlier.

Kai Holst had been working at the military office number 4 (Mi4) at the Norwegian legation in Stockholm, and after the search he unexpectedly traveled right back to Stockholm. The next day he was found shot at the top of the staircase in an apartment building at Rindögatan 42 on Gärdet. The official cause of death was stated as suicide, but neither Holst's family nor many of his colleagues from the resistance movement have accepted this and are of the opinion that he was liquidated. The historian Tore Pryser has put forward the hypothesis that Holst brought with him information from Lillehammer that could damage Operation Claw and thus was killed. To be able to damage the operation Kai Holst can not have been trusted as others were. He must have been considered a threat due to his contact with Alexandra Kollontaj who was ambassador in Stockholm representing Soviet Union. A possible reason for a murder of Kai Holst was thus not his knowledge as such but his connections.

Aftermath 
Operation Claw was the beginning of the postwar era cooperation between Swedish and US intelligence services, in violation of Sweden's officially stated neutrality. From the American side the operation was viewed as a great success and the responsible within OSS, William T. Carlson and Joseph T. Kloman, were both honored with decorations where the operation specifically were mentioned. For the Swedish C-byrån Operation Claw quickly became toxic. Even though the operation was to be kept confidential, information leaked to the Swedish press and C-byrån were dissolved in February 1946.

Information regarding Operation Claw continued to be classified as confidential in the post-war years and some of it still remains so today. A report about the operation in the British National Archives is restricted until 2020.

United States intelligence operations"," Operation Claw Operation Claw was a series of military operations that took place in 1966 during the Vietnam War. The operations were designed to test the effectiveness of the U.S. Army's new weapons and tactics against an entrenched enemy. The operations took place in the Central Highlands of South Vietnam, in an area where the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) had established base areas and logistical routes. The NVA had also built an extensive network of trenches and underground tunnels, and had positioned a large number of antiaircraft weapons in the area. The U.S. Army's 1st Infantry Division, led by Major General William E. DePuy, was chosen to conduct the operations. The division was equipped with the latest weapons and vehicles, and was trained in the latest tactics. The division's mission was to destroy the NVA forces in the area, and to break the enemy's logistical lines. The operation began on June 24, 1966, with a series of air attacks by U.S. Air Force planes. The air attacks were followed by a series of artillery strikes, and then by a ground attack by the 1st Infantry Division. The ground attack was met with strong resistance, and the fighting continued for several days. The operation was a success, and the NVA forces were defeated. The 1st Infantry Division suffered heavy casualties, but it was able to break the enemy's logistical lines and to destroy a large number of enemy weapons and vehicles. The operation also provided valuable experience for the division's soldiers, and it helped to improve the U.S. Army's tactics.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,39762269,0.07994670219853431,0.10526315789473684,0.23481459805192093,0.1573208722741433,4,5,1,0,3,1,0,0,0,1,0.22629086772905396,0.013283891616661318,0.0027616680475006906,0.01597051597051597,7,0,9,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,10,1,19,1,1,1

Orkin was born in Johannesburg, South Africa. She obtained her medical degree in 1995 from the University of the Witwatersrand and was the prize student in virology and microbiology. She began her clinical training trained at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital, Soweto in the 1990s. At the time, between 30 and 40% of medical inpatients were infected with HIV and Orkin herself, lost close friends to AIDS. She moved to the United Kingdom. In 1998, she completed her specialist training in HIV and Genitourinary Medicine  at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital. Towards the end of her specialist training, Orkin moved to Botswana together with nurse colleague and partner Flick Thorley to establish an HIV/AIDS treatment programme in Francistown as part of the government anti-retroviral roll-out. In 2006, Orkin completed a MSc in Infectious Diseases from The London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.

Research and career 
At the age of 29, Orkin was appointed as Consultant physician at Barts Health NHS Trust. Her specialist interests are the development of novel antiretroviral therapies, blood-borne virus testing and health inequalities. In 2013, she led the Test Me East HIV testing campaign which was supported by David Furnish, Sir Elton John and Sadie Frost and covered by CNN, Channel 4 and ITV news. In 2015, she spearheaded ‘Going Viral’, a week-long campaign to raise awareness of blood-borne viruses. The week-long novel campaign offered HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C testing in emergency departments around the United Kingdom utilising an opt-out testing strategy. The campaign was widely covered in the media and supported by several high profile celebrities, including actor Richard Wilson and DJ Tim Westwood. She led the first ever phase III clinical trial into the use of injectable anti-retrovirals. After appearing on ITV News to discuss the treatment, she was trolled on social media where many misogynistic and homophobic comments were made about her appearance and sexual identity. This experience led her to take action on gender and sexuality-based discrimination. Shortly after she stood for election and was elected Vice President of the Medical Women's Federation in 2019. Orkin has also served as Chair of the British HIV Association from 2017-2019 and is on the Governing Council for the International AIDS Society.

In 2018, Orkin and the British HIV Association announced their commitment to the Undetectable=Untransmittable (U=U) campaign.

During the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, she led on safe delivery of COVID-19 treatment trials at the 5 Barts Health NHS Trust hospitals including NHS Nightingale London (the first non-hospital, non-military research delivery). Since then she has led the team that created a new clinical trial centre in a community library to deliver a large SARS CoV2 vaccine trials and was appointed as its clinical director. She has also led research into poor health outcomes in ethnically diverse people and on gender disparities in women's academic careers. She is lead investigator for the first COVID-19 vaccine trial in pregnant women.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Angular rate sensor"", the article should at least have 250 words","Angular rate sensors, ARS, are devices that directly measure angular rate, without integration in conditioning electronics. Gyroscopes also measure angular rate. Generally gyroscopes are able to measure a constant rotation rate, while rate sensors also include devices with a low cut off frequency that is other than zero.

Technologies
Main technologies for rate sensors:
 Electromechanical (various types)
 Vibrating structure gyroscopes, including MEMS gyroscopes
 Ring laser gyroscopes
 Fibre optic gyroscopes
 MHD sensors, based on the magnetohydrodynamic effect
 Electrochemical sensors (based on molecular electronic transducer (MET) technology)

MET sensors
There are two types of MET rate sensors that directly measure angular rate: one that is able to measure constant angular rate (DC sensitive) and one that is not.

A non–DC-sensitive angular rate sensor consists of a toroid filled with a special electrolyte that moves when the device is rotated about its measurement axis. When this happens the electrolyte flows through the sensing element, which is rigidly fixed inside the channel, and the motion is detected. The output signal is proportional to the angular rate due to internal integration that occurs inside of the sensing element. The cutoff frequency for measurements can be as low as 0.005 Hz.

A DC-sensitive angular rate sensor or gyroscope has a more complex design and uses measurement of Coriolis acceleration to determine angular rate..

Uses
Angular rate sensors are used in a variety of applications including vehicle handling, crash, biomechanics, and high-rate ballistics testing.  
Modern cars typically contain a Yaw-rate sensor which determines how far off-axis a car is ""tilting"" in a turn.

Sensors"," Angular rate sensor An angular rate sensor, sometimes referred to as a gyroscope, is a device for measuring the angular velocity of an object. An angular rate sensor is a type of inertial sensor that is used to measure the non-comitant or non-centripetal acceleration, in other words the angular acceleration, of a moving object. However, due to the principle of conservation of angular momentum, the body will always move in a straight line unless an external force is applied. Therefore, an angular rate sensor will only measure the angular acceleration if it is induced by an external force. An angular rate sensor is a device which measures the speed of rotation at which an object is moving. angular rate sensors are often used in the field of robotics, in which a rotating object such as a motor or a spinning wheel is a fundamental component. They can also be used in the field of virtual reality, in which a person's head movements are tracked in order to update the image on a screen. The basic principle of the angular rate sensor is that it contains a mass that is able to move in a plane. As the object moves, the mass will experience an acceleration in the direction of the movement. This acceleration will cause the mass to move out of the plane. The amount by which the mass moves out of the plane will depend on the angular velocity of the object. The sensor will then be able to detect the position of the mass and determine the angular velocity. There are many different types of angular rate sensors. One type is the gyroscope. A gyroscope is a sensor that is able to measure the angular velocity of an object by detecting the amount by which it rotates around a fixed axis. Another type of angular rate sensor is the accelerometer.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Autopharmacology"", the article should at least have 250 words","Autopharmacology relates to the scientific study of the regulation of body functions by the activity of its naturally existent (or endogenous) chemical factors of the tissues. A more restricted definition would consider substances that were first identified as external agents which had a documented action on physiological functions, but later were discovered as existing as endogenous factors. The best example is the class of endorphins, which, as its name implies, were discovered to exist in the brain and have specific receptors in it, by investigations on the mechanism of action of opioids, such as morphine.

Historically, the first approach to the concept of autopharmacology began with British physiologist and pharmacologist Henry Dale in the 1910s, discovered the role of acetylcholine in synaptic transmission, and later proved by Austrian physiologist Otto Loewi, to be the neurotransmitter involved in the proximal synapses of the autonomic nervous system (initially named Vagusstoff by Loewi, and later identified as acetylcholine). The same happened to another autonomic neurotransmitter, noradrenaline (Akzeleransstoff by Loewi), which later proved to be chemically similar to a long used pharmacological agent, adrenaline, a hormone secreted by the adrenal glands. Both scientists were awarded the 1936 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for their pioneering and important contributions.

A research area where autopharmacology principles assumed great importance was that of pain and inflammation, due to the great number of endogenous messengers, transmitters and modulators involved in their complex response at molecular and cellular level. The control and regulation mechanisms of the circulatory system and renal functions and their interactions (such as the renin/angiotensin system) are also greatly influenced by autopharmacological agents; One of the autopharmacology pioneers was Professor Mauricio Rocha e Silva, leader of the team of Brazilian researchers who discovered bradykinin in 1948, an endogenous substance involved in hypotension in circulatory shock. Of course, all these systems are of extreme importance for clinical practice and for the discovery of new therapeutic drugs.

Endogenous substances that could fall under the concept of autopharmacology are:

 Endorphins
 Dynorphin
 Bradykinin
 Prostaglandins
 Angiotensin
 Secretin
 Gastrin
 Cholecystokinin
 Histamine
 Cannabinoids
 Substance P

The main scientific criterion for an autopharmacological agent is the discovery of specific membrane receptors for it and, hopefully, its transduction and cell signaling mechanisms.

The term was never much of a mainstream concept, and has fallen into disuse, as research on basic mechanisms has advanced. In a recent literature search on PubMed, only six titles refer to the term autopharmacology.

Pharmacology
Physiology"," Autopharmacology Autopharmacology is the study of the effects of drugs and other substances on the body when those substances are self-administered. The term is derived from the Greek prefix ""auto"" (self) and the Latin word ""pharma"" (drug). In this context, the term ""self-administered"" refers to substances that are not prescribed by a physician or other health professional, and substances that are not consumed for the purpose of maintaining or improving one's health. The term ""autopharmacology"" was coined in 1970 by the Hungarian-born psychologist Albert Michotte to describe the effects of self-administered substances in his book, The Psychology of the Other: An Empirical and Theoretical Study of Social Perception. In the book, Michotte proposed that people develop attitudes toward drugs and other substances that are a function of their perceived psychological effects. In the subsequent decades, autopharmacology has been studied by researchers from various disciplines, including psychology, medicine, and neuroscience. These researchers have investigated a range of topics, including the effects of self-administered substances on mood, cognitive functioning, and physiological processes, as well as the psychological and physiological mechanisms that underlie the effects of these substances. One key area of research in autopharmacology is the study of substance use disorders, which are characterized by the inability to control substance intake and the negative consequences of substance use. Researchers have investigated the neurobiological and psychological mechanisms that underlie substance use disorders, and have developed treatments and interventions to help individuals with these disorders manage their substance intake and improve their overall well-being. In addition to substance use disorders, autopharmacology research has also explored the effects of self-administered substances on various medical conditions, including pain, sleep, and mood disorders. Researchers have investigated the potential benefits and risks of using self-administered substances to manage these conditions, and have sought to understand the underlying mechanisms that may contribute to the effects of these substances. Overall, autopharmacology is a complex and multidisciplinary field that seeks to understand the effects of self-administered substances on the body and mind, as well as the psychological and physiological mechanisms that underlie these effects.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,35484901,0.039381153305203934,0.09473684210526316,0.18336128026358367,0.2881619937694704,3,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0.23314425378571574,0.01999825358787315,0.004142502071251036,0.01597051597051597,2,0,5,6,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,7,1,1,1
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Whitehurst Hall"", the article should at least have 250 words","Whitehurst Hall is an administrative building at Oklahoma State University. It was built in 1926 and named after John A. Whitehurst, president of the Oklahoma Board of Agriculture from 1918 to 1926.

History
The building originally housed the office for Oklahoma State University President Henry G. Bennett, his staff, the library, departments of agricultural school and other administrative offices. At the time it was built, it was one of the few structures west of Washington Street, not far from agricultural fields, experimental plots, stockyards, chicken coops and barns. Located near the site of the old brick College Barn. In 1926 the construction of Whitehurst Hall was the largest building project attempted at the college.

Construction
The groundbreaking for construction of Whitehurst Hall began in September 1925. Scaffolding for the walls and structural work was installed in early November, and the crews began erecting the reinforced concrete and steel structure. Whitehurst stands three stories tall with reinforced concrete floors, a flat roof and brick walls. There were 240 windows and steam lines running from the college power plant about 100 yards east provided heat. The outside dimensions of Whitehurst Hall were 262 by 80 feet, with roughly 17,500 square feet of floor space on each of the facility's three floors. The total area in the building surpassed 52,000 square feet. A basement, used mostly for utility connections and equipment, was located beneath the structure. Three doors were located at the center of the south face, which would be considered the front of the building, and the other entrances were at the northeast and northwest corners of the main building where it attached to the modified wings. Open stairwells from the first to third floors were situated near the doors on the north side of the structure. Total cost of construction reached over $250,000.

Renovations
Renovations to Whitehurst Hall were made in 1936, including the addition of the fourth floor, after damage to the building occurred and repairs were already necessary. Once additional building renovations were approved following the damage, including the addition of the new fourth floor, the renovation project total reached $75,000 (about $1.25 million in 2013).

Significant Event
On Friday the 13th, 1936 there was an explosion in a 3½-square-foot tunnel below the 6 inch concrete floor, which ran inside foundation walls and around the building. Natural gas, which leaked into the tunnel system, was ignited after an accidental spark was introduced during routine maintenance for a clogged drain. The first damage estimate was for $5,500 (equivalent to about $91,500 in 2013) to fix floors, replace windows, install new ventilators and gas lines, and repair and replace furniture.

Present
In 2015, Whitehurst Hall is an administrative building, continuing to host the President's office, in addition to other administrative offices.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Tangzhuang"", the article should at least have 250 words","A tangzhuang (唐裝) is a kind of Manchu jacket with a straight collar. It is an updated form of the Qing magua, itself a more fashionable adaptation of the riding jacket once worn by Manchu horsemen.

Name
Tángzhuāng is the pinyin romanization of the Mandarin pronunciation of the clothes' Chinese name, written as  in traditional characters and as  in the simplified characters now used in mainland China. Its spelling may vary a little in other romanizations or dialects. It is also sometimes translated as a  or jacket.

Although the name of the jacket in English and Chinese suggests an origin during (or at least reference to) the Tang period of Chinese history, it was actually intended by its designers to mean a ""Chinese"" outfit. In fact, “Tangzhuang” is basically the Chinese style of dress in the late Qing Dynasty. The origin of the term “Tangzhuang” also has a taste of “export to domestic sales”. Foreigners call “China town” as “Tang People Street”, and naturally call Chinese clothing “Tangzhuang”. In southern China and among the Chinese diaspora, dialects like Cantonese refer to ethnic Chinese—as opposed to all Chinese nationals—as ""Tang people"" rather than ""Han"". It is thus also sometimes translated as a  After criticism of the misleading name appeared in various Chinese media, some of its designers and some government officials began to call the garment the ""new tangzhuang"" or  but neither name lasted. Instead, most Chinese people came to accept the designers' original name for the garment and some even expanded it to describe any form of traditional Chinese clothing.

History

Magua

The tangzhuang is an adaption of the Manchu ""horse jacket"" (magua), a waist- or three-quarter-length front-opening jacket or surcoat. This was initially worn—usually in a dark blue color—by Manchu horsemen, but became mandatory for Han officials' clothing under the Qing Empire. Over time, it evolved from a protective apron for the changshan into an item of Chinese fashion in its own right and even a mark of imperial favor. Its use then spread among the common Han, including among the Chinese diaspora abroad. 

Following the 1911 Xinhai Revolution and 1949 Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War, the ""Mao suit"" (Zhōngshān zhuāng) gradually displaced the changshan and magua in most contexts. After the fall of the Gang of Four in the late 1970s and the beginning of Deng Xiaoping's Opening Up Policy in the 1980s, traditional clothing began to experience a revival in mainland China. Variants of the magua became noticeably more common in Chinese fashion from the mid-1990s.

2001 APEC Summit

In 1993, US president Bill Clinton tried to bring trade talks back on track by inviting the heads of the APEC member economies to personally attend what had until then been a ministerial conference. He requested leaders' clothes remain informal and presented each with a leather bomber jacket bearing the APEC logo as a memento. The next year, Indonesia followed suit and presented batik shirts; the world leaders then humored Suharto's request that they wear them for a group photo. The tradition developed that the summits' hosts would present traditional and representative clothes from their cultures, and the leaders would wear them on the last day of the conference as a show of solidarity.

Ahead of the first occasion of China's hosting the summit in 2001, state-run media acquainted the Chinese with the custom, prompting speculation as to what China's ""traditional clothes"" might be: Mao suits had been displaced by western-style suits; minority groups often had recognizable ethnic costumes but styles of Han clothing (hànfú) had varied from dynasty to dynasty, with the most recent Qing forms heavily influenced by the Manchus and their oppressive dress codes. Although these designs were among the 40 presented to the Chinese government over the span of a year, their foreign origin or political connotations led officials to select an ""ambiguously traditional"" design by Shanghainese clothiers Li Jianqin (, Lǐ Jiànqín) and Yu Ying (t s Yú Yīng) and by five others at Qinyi (t s Qínyì Fúshì) and the Shanghai Garment Group (t s Shànghǎi Fúzhuāng Jítuán). 

The jackets given to the APEC leaders were a blend of Chinese motifs and western design, made from silk supposedly artificially enhanced to be stronger, softer, more wrinkle-resistant, more water-absorbent, and better ventilated, with longer-lasting and brighter colors. They featured cotton knotwork instead of buttons and a design of peonies surrounding the letters ""APEC"". The jackets were handmade but not personally sized; instead, they were fitted using stand-ins and body doubles, with a partially-completed backup available in case those measurements were mistaken. The leaders had a choice among scarlet, azure, green, brown, maroon, and black versions; each came in a matching silk bag adorned with the APEC logo and each had an off-white silk shirt to wear beneath it. The 20 attendees—the leaders of all the APEC member economies except ""Chinese Taipei""—mostly opted for the red-and-black or blue-and-gold design and wore the jackets to their meetings at the Shanghai Science and Technology Museum on 21 October 2001 and for the ""Leaders' Family Portrait"" afterwards that closed the event.

Tangzhuang craze
The tangzhuang's use as the representative unisex Chinese clothing for the ""Leaders' Family Portrait"" immediately led to its more widespread popularity, spreading from Beijing to other large towns around the country as far afield as Lanzhou in Gansu by the next Chinese New Year. This ""tangzhuang craze"" (t s tángzhuāng rè) saw the tangzhuang and other traditional clothes become fashionable daily wear for both sexes, which gave a large boost to the domestic silk industry. The original designers left their original companies to start their own businesses to capitalize on their creation's popularity, but the fad was short-lived and most had moved on by 2004.

Subsequent history

Even after the end of its fad, the tangzhuang continues to have a place in Chinese fashion. It remained in common use among Jiang Zemin's clique and the nouveau riche, but more especially became a menswear staple on the mainland and abroad for traditional Chinese holidays alongside western and Mao-style suits.

The tangzhuang—and its perceived inauthenticity as ethnic clothing—is also credited by members of the hanfu movement with having inspired their cause and a revival of actual traditional Han clothing, despite the Chinese public's usual confusion about its origin. (Traditional Chinese fashions have been so long mixed with Manchu and western elements that Tang-style robes are confused with Japanese kimonos and Ming clothes with Korean hanboks.)

China used the ""Tang suit jackets"" again for its 2014 APEC summit, but with an updated style in maroon, green, and blue that The Guardian unflatteringly compared to Star Trek uniforms.

Style

The APEC jackets were intended to reflect ""both traditional Chinese flavor and modern ideals"". They have straight Mandarin collars, similar to those on the changshan and magua that gave the style its name. Unlike the traditional 2D ""flat-cutting""  píngmiàn cáijiǎn) process used to create those garments, which tends to produce a baggy and ill-fitted look, tangzhuangs are made using the 3D ""solid-cutting"" (t s lìtǐ cáijiǎn) process developed in Europe. In particular, they employ draping, darts, and set-in sleeves cut separately from the rest of the main garment, which give them a more fitted look than traditional Chinese designs. The original version also employed shoulder pads to give a stronger silhouette.

Although the APEC jackets were pointedly made using artificial fibers, silk tangzhuang have since outsold those made from cotton and other materials. Tangzhuang are available in a variety of colors, although the most common are red or blue. The brocade is often decorated with a repeated pattern of embroidery. Common designs involve the repetition of auspicious Chinese characters such as fú (, ""happiness"") or shòu (t, s, ""longevity"") for good luck and good wishes. Tangzhuang are usually fastened with decorative knotwork instead of buttons.

Tangzhuang are usually considered menswear but they may also be worn by women, as by New Zealand's prime minister Helen Clark at APEC 2001.

21st-century fashion"," Tangzhuang is a type of Chinese jacket, typically made of silk and lined with fur. The term tangzhuang (Chinese: 冠裙; pinyin: guāngqun) literally means ""jacket and skirt"", and the jacket is usually worn with a skirt, over a full-sleeved shirt. The tangzhuang is a relatively new type of garment; it only appeared during the late Ming dynasty and the early Qing dynasty, when it was worn by the Joseon dynasty of Korea. The tangzhuang is a tight-fitting, button-up jacket, often lined with fur on the inside. The jacket is similar to the Chinese court jacket, but is usually made of silk, while the court jacket is made of brocade. The tangzhuang is usually worn with a skirt, but can also be worn with pants. In Korea, the tangzhuang is called a magua (Korean: 마구아; Hanja: 冠裙; literally ""jacket and skirt""), and was a popular garment during the Joseon dynasty. The magua is a representative garment of the Joseon period, and was worn by both men and women.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Andrew van der Bijl"", the article should at least have 250 words","Andrew van der Bijl (born 11 May 1928; known in English-speaking countries as Brother Andrew) is a Dutch Christian missionary, known for smuggling Bibles into communist countries at the height of the Cold War. For his activities, he earned the nickname ""God's Smuggler"". He is known for having prayed ""Lord, make seeing eyes blind"" when he was stopped at the border of a communist country for his car to be inspected.

Biography
Van der Bijl was born in Sint Pancras, the Netherlands, the fourth of six children of a poor, near-deaf blacksmith and an invalid mother. He told John and Elizabeth Sherrill, when they transcribed his memories for their book God's Smuggler, ""From the day I first put on wooden shoes – klompen we call them in Holland – I dreamed of derring-do"".

In the 1940s, he enlisted in the colonial army of the Dutch East Indies during the rebellion that would eventually form Indonesia, which first adventure initially had unpleasant results; he endured a period of severe emotional stress while he was serving as a soldier. He was wounded in the ankle during the fighting; during his rehabilitation, he read the Bible obsessively, eventually converting to Christianity. Van der Bijl studied at the WEC Missionary Training College in Glasgow, Scotland.

Ministry
In July 1955, Andrew van der Bijl visited Communist Poland ""to see how my brothers are doing"", a reference to the underground church there. He signed up on a government-controlled Communist tour, the only legal way to be in the country. During that time, he felt called to respond to the Biblical Commission, ""Wake up, strengthen what remains and is about to die"" (). That was the start of a mission leading him into several communist-ruled countries in which religious belief was actively persecuted.
In 1957, he travelled to the Soviet Union’s capital, Moscow, in a Volkswagen Beetle, which later became the symbol of Open Doors, the organization he founded. An older couple, the Whetstras, had given him their new car because they had prayed about it and believed that Andrew would need the car. A man who lived in Amersfoort, Karl de Graaf, claimed that God told him to teach Van der Bijl to drive. Later, when Van der Bijl was in a refugee camp in West Germany, Philip Whetstra called Van der Bijl to come to the Whetstras' new house in Amsterdam. Although Van der Bijl was violating the laws of all of the countries that he visited by bringing religious literature, he often placed the material in view when he was stopped at police checkpoints, as a gesture of his trust in what he believed to be God's protection. That was the realization of his childhood dreams of derring-do.

Van der Bijl visited China in  the 1960s, after the Cultural Revolution had created a hostile policy towards Christianity and other religions, during the so-called Bamboo Curtain. He went to Czechoslovakia when the suppression by Soviet troops of the Prague Spring had put an end to relative religious freedom there. He encouraged Czech believers and gave Bibles to the Russian occupying forces. During that decade, he also made his first visits to Cuba after the Cuban Revolution.

God's Smuggler
In 1967, he published the first edition of God's Smuggler, written with John and Elizabeth Sherrill. God's Smuggler tells the story of his early childhood, conversion to Christianity, and adventures as a Bible-smuggler behind the Iron Curtain. By 2002, it had sold over 10 million copies in thirty-five languages. A comic book adaptation of God's Smuggler was published in 1972 by Spire Christian Comics.

Middle East
After the fall of Communism in Europe, he shifted his focus to the Middle East and has worked to strengthen the church in the Muslim world. In the 1970s, he visited war-torn Lebanon several times, stating that ""global conflict in the end times will focus on Israel and its neighbouring countries.""

Light Force and Secret Believers
In the 1990s, van der Bijl again travelled several times more to the Middle East. In his book Light Force, he tells of Arab and Lebanese churches in Lebanon, Israel and Israeli-occupied areas expressing great delight at the mere visit of a fellow Christian from abroad since they felt that the church in the Western world at large was largely ignoring them.

In similar fashion, van der Bijl and a companion, Al Janssen, visited Hamas and PLO leaders, including Ahmed Yassin and Yasser Arafat, and handed out Bibles.

Van der Bijl's tenth book, Secret Believers: What Happens When Muslims Believe in Christ, was released on 1 July 2007.

Dutch expatriates in the United Kingdom"," Andrew van der Bijl (31 January 1889 – 29 June 1956), also known as Brother Andrew, was a Dutch Protestant religious leader and teacher who founded the Ecumenical Christian Church in England. van der Bijl was born in Eeklo, Belgium, to a Dutch father and a Belgian mother. He studied at the University of Groningen and the University of Leiden. In 1914 he obtained a degree in medicine, and in 1915 he qualified as a dentist. In 1916 he moved to England and set up a dental practice in London. In the early 1930s, van der Bijl became associated with a Christian group that was later to become the Ecumenical Christian Church. He was one of the group's leading members, and in 1938 he was appointed its general secretary. The Ecumenical Christian Church was officially established in 1942 and was characterized by its emphasis on the universal nature of the Christian church and the need for unity among Christians. It also placed an emphasis on the importance of the Bible and the value of the spiritual life. In the late 1940s, van der Bijl began to experience health problems and was forced to cut back on his activities. He died in 1956, at the age of 67, from lung cancer.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,2169958,0.07426160337552744,0.08421052631578947,0.22195746183037685,0.08099688473520249,2,9,1,0,6,1,0,0,0,1,0.1957066659778033,0.01997121873291969,0.0038663352665009665,0.01597051597051597,3,0,5,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,9,1,15,1,1,1

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Silly (band)"", the article should at least have 250 words","Silly is a German rock band. Founded in East Germany in 1977, Silly was one of the country's most popular music acts, and was well known for its charismatic lead singer Tamara Danz. Her death in 1996 ended the band's recording career after 18 years. In 2005 the surviving members began to perform as Silly again, first with several guest singers, before choosing actress Anna Loos to replace Danz. The first album with the new line-up, Alles Rot, became the band's most successful to date, reaching number 3 on the German charts in 2010.

Band history
The band was founded in East Berlin in 1977 as Familie Silly (The Silly Family) by guitarist Thomas Fritzsching and bassist Mathias Schramm, evolving from Fritzsching's previous band Phönix. They added Familie to the band's name after East German authorities refused to allow Silly by itself, as they saw it as an anglicism; the band claimed that Silly was the name of their mascot, a cat, who behaved in a silly manner.

The early band also consisted of keyboardists Ulrich Mann and Manfred Kusno and drummer Mike Schafmeier. They recruited singer Tamara Danz, the daughter of a diplomat who had previously studied linguistics; she had previously worked as a singer in both the Oktoberklub, a politically charged vocal group, and the , a popular progressive rock ensemble.

Silly's first notable concert appearances outside East Germany were in Romania, where the band gained a strong following; it helped that Fritzsching and Danz could speak Romanian fluently. They participated in several music festivals, and in 1981 won the Lyra in Bratislava, the communist bloc's best-known music prize (akin to the Sanremo Music Festival). The band was also allowed to perform in Norway.

Unusually, the band's first, self-titled album was released first in West Germany in 1981, where it sold moderately well; this was due in part to the enthusiasm of West German record promoters (including photographer Jim Rakete) for the band, in contrast to the East German state record label Amiga's reluctance to produce an album.

After the album was released, the band made the acquaintance of poet , who would write the lyrics for the band's albums until 1989. His complex and often politically charged lyrics gave the band a strong intellectual appeal, but frequently landed them in trouble with the censors, who demanded changes before allowing a song to be performed. With the West German album a fait accompli, Amiga was forced to issue it domestically, as Tanzt keiner Boogie? (Isn't Anyone Going to Boogie?), where it was immensely popular; the revised version dropped two songs in favor of two new recordings with lyrics by Karma, one of which, the atypical Der letzte Kunde (The Last Customer), a paean to alcoholism sung by drummer Schafmeier, became the early band's signature tune.

In 1982, Danz's then-boyfriend Rüdiger ""Ritchie"" Barton joined the band, replacing its two keyboardists. His first appearance was a note-for-note cover version of Kim Carnes' hit ""Bette Davis Eyes"", which, following long-standing practice, the state recording label Amiga issued to avoid having to pay performance royalties for the original song. While it earned the band substantial publicity, they showed their evident unhappiness with it by performing it on television dressed as schoolchildren eating ice cream (Eis, in German, is pronounced much as ""eyes""). The song was the only Silly release not to be in German; it was also their last release under the name ""Familie Silly"".

Barton's synthesizer playing lent a new wave edge to the band's subsequent album, , named for the ""rubbish mountain"" in Berlin's Friedrichshain district that was built over the debris of a World War II flak tower in a park of the neighbourhood. The title track, a massive hit in East Germany, is typical of Karma's narrative writing style, with several overtones. It concerns a conversation between two women, one old and one young; the younger one thanks the city fathers for the hill, which for her is only as a place to catch some fresh air; the older replies to her that it was the city mothers – Germany's Trümmerfrauen – who had built the hill from the city ruins.

Mont Klamott was voted East Germany's Album of the Year, cementing Silly's popularity. At the time, the band toured constantly, spending most of its time on the road. Schafmeier was forced to leave the band for health reasons, and he took the band's best-known song ""Der letzte Kunde"" with him, joining the cabaret trio MTS. He was replaced by Herbert Junck, formerly of NO 55.

Silly's censorship problem became more acute in 1985 when their planned album Zwischen unbefahr'nen Gleisen (Between Untraveled Tracks; presumably those between the two German states), was blocked by East German officials, who had taken exception to the ""subversive"" message of several tracks.

It was eventually released as Liebeswalzer (Waltz of Love), containing rewritten lyrics. The offending songs, ""Tausend Augen"" (""Thousand Eyes""), ""Nur ein Lied"" (""Only a Song""), and the title track, were re-recorded with new lyrics and arrangements and renamed ""Psycho"", ""Großer Träumer"" (""Big Dreamer""), and ""Berliner Frühling"" (""Berlin Spring""). In 1990, as East Germany was in its dying days, Liebeswalzer was re-released with the three songs in their original form. The unaltered album was finally released on CD with both versions, in 1994.

Despite the controversy, Liebeswalzer again was voted Album of the Year, and Silly won one argument with the censors over the word Titten (tits) in the song ""So 'ne kleine Frau"" (Such a Little Woman), which was left unaltered.

Bassist Jäcki Reznicek, formerly of  Pankow, played fretless bass on the title track to the next album, Bataillon d'Amour (Battalion of Love, 1986), which proved to be one of the best-known songs ever to come out of East Germany (the main bass line was played by Schramm). The album was released on CBS Records in West Germany, although CBS rejected the East German cover artwork as amateurish and supplied their own. The song ""Schlohweißer Tag"" (Snow White Day) was later used in Heiner Carow's 1989 film Coming Out. After the album was released, Schramm was asked to leave the band, and was replaced by Reznicek.

Following the success of Bataillon d'Amour, the band took a two-year break from recording, during which they split with Karma. He contributed only two songs to Silly's next effort, Februar, released in that month in 1989 (in West Germany; the domestic release was a month later). After a falling out with Werner Karma, Danz sought the assistance of up-and-coming singer-songwriter Gerhard Gundermann in writing lyrics, who had already drawn notice for his witty wordplay on his 1988 debut album. Recorded in West Berlin, the album was, like its predecessor, state-of-the-art, and as a co-production with a West German label, there was, for the first time, no censorship. Joining the band was guitarist Uwe Hassbecker, Danz's new paramour, formerly of Stern Meißen, whom she had met while singing in the East German supergroup, Die Gitarreros, in 1986. His heavy metal-inspired playing contrasted with Thomas Fritzsching's more melodic approach, causing Fritzsching to be marginalized; although technically the bandleader, he was excluded from the recording sessions.

Again, it was released on a West German label, this time Ariola, and again the cover artwork was replaced with a more sophisticated version. While not an enormous hit in the west, the track ""Verlorene Kinder"" (""Lost Children"") received some airplay. The Song is about children, who living in dysfunctional families. The song was only able to release in East Germany, because the critic of the song was officially seen as critic on West Berlin conditions. The track ""Ein Gespenst geht um"" (A Ghost Haunts), an oblique political commentary which drew on a quotation by Karl Marx about political change in the air (although the ghost here haunted a Mitropa restaurant rather than Europa), and the song seemed somewhat prescient in light of the fall of the Berlin Wall in November that year. Also ""Über ihr taute das Eis"" (""The ice thawed over her"") was an unusual song for East german conditions, telling the story of a minor girls suicide.

However, the end of communism did not lead to a breakthrough for Silly. Although Danz had petitioned the East German government for change during 1989, and illegally read out petitions during the band's concerts, interest in East German bands plummeted after November 9, 1989, when East Germans were able to cross into West Germany and easily get their hands on western rock music. Danz performed as a backup singer at a massive free concert featuring the likes of Joe Cocker following the Wall opening. She later expressed skepticism that her involvement with the Neues Forum reform movement had produced any results.

At the same time, however, the West German label Ariola believed Silly could be turned into a household name across all of Germany. The band were invited to Bavaria to work on a new album. But Danz felt constrained by the Ariola executives, who deemed the band's songs not commercial, and provided them with chart-friendly music and lyrics by outside writers. Silly walked out.

Instead, Silly's next album would be the self-produced Hurensöhne (Sons of Bitches), released in 1993 on DSB, the successor label to the state-run Amiga. Again, the lyrics were penned by Danz and Gundermann, separately and together; as the album's title suggests, they were angry. The song ""Neider"" (The Enviers) addresses the band's treatment at the hands of Ariola. The album closer, ""Traumpaar"" (Dream Couple) imagines the two German states as a dancing pair, die Schlampe und der Held – the whore and the hero.

Largely ignored in western Germany, Hurensöhne reestablished Silly as an important band in the east, as fans returned in droves amid disillusionment with German reunification. The group's concerts once again sold out. After the album, Danz, Hassbecker, and Barton began building their own recording studio in Berlin, named Danzmusik. Fritzsching, the band's founder, whose guitar contributions had become overshadowed by those of Hassbecker, was asked to leave the band.

Late during the recording for the follow-up, Paradies, in 1995, Danz was diagnosed with breast cancer. Although she was operated on immediately, the disease had spread, and she refused chemotherapy, instead choosing an ineffective alternative medicine treatment. She died the following July, five months after the album had come out. Shortly before her death, she married Hassbecker, her live-in partner of many years; she said this was in part to avoid taxes on her share of the studio.

Paradies was the first album on which Danz alone had written the lyrics, and several of its song seem to reflect on her impending death, although Danz denied this, saying that the words had been written before her diagnosis. The album was photographed by the band's old friend Jim Rakete. Despite minimal publicity, and the lack, for obvious reasons, of a tour, it sold reasonably well, and its title track became a radio hit.

The band did not break up after Danz's death; the remaining members (Barton, Hassbecker, Rezniczek, and Junck) completed two unfinished tracks for inclusion on a pair of greatest hits albums, the first of which sold well over 100,000 copies, no small achievement for a compilation of an East German band. The remaining members performed Silly's songs on tour on two occasions, the first ""borrowing"" singer  from the band City for a number of one-off performances, and in 2005 using several well-known singers on a German tour promoted as a tribute to both Danz and Junck, who had died of cancer earlier in the year.

In 2006 Hassbecker, Barton, and Reznicek announced a new electro-acoustic tour with actress and singer Anna Loos; the live band included Reznicek's son Bastian on drums, Hassbecker's son Daniel on cello, and former  guitarist . Initially billed as ""Silly with Anna Loos"", the band asked Loos to join the band permanently following the tour.

At Loos' suggestion, the band approached, and reconciled with, lyricist Werner Karma. In early 2010, the band, which had no members from its original lineup, released its first new album since 1996, Alles Rot (Everything Red), with all its lyrics written by Karma. Thanks in part to the attention drawn by Loos, Silly was able to sign to the major label Universal Music. The album proved to be the band's most successful to date, reaching number 3 on the German charts, and the band toured to numerous sold-out venues.

Legacy

In 1998, singer Joachim Witt had a hit in Germany with a cover version of ""Bataillon d'Amour."" The Polish goth metal band  was also named for the song.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Camille Seaman"", the article should at least have 250 words","Camille Seaman (born 1969) is an American photographer who applies portraiture strategies to capture the changing natural environment.  Her work mainly concerns the polar regions, where she captures the effects of climate change, thus merging the realms of science and art.  She is of Native American and African-American descent through her father and mother respectively.

Background 
Camille Seaman was born to a Shinnecock father and African-American mother in 1969.  She studied photography with Jan Groover at the State University of New York at Purchase, graduating in 1992.

Work 
Seaman reached wider attention with the production of her 2003 series of photographs of the Arctic Ocean island of Svalbard.  Since then, her work has continued to engage with the effects of climate change through the depiction of icebergs, storms and other natural phenomena.  Regarding a major exhibition mounted at the National Academy of Sciences, Ralph J. Cicerone noted that the Academy had two goals in mind, ""to encourage wider appreciation of her artistry and to stimulate focused thought about the important roles that ice formations play in climatic change.""

For her work merging science with art, Seaman was named a TED Senior Fellow and profiled in Wired and on The New York Times ""Lens"" photojournalism blog.

In 2014, Seaman received a John S. Knight Journalism Fellowship at Stanford University.

Awards and recognition
In 2006, Seaman was granted a National Geographic Award, and in 2007 she was awarded a Critical Mass Top Monograph Award by the nonprofit organization Photolucida.  Her work has been published in Newsweek, Time, The New York Times and Men's Journal.

"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""Restless Heart: The Confessions of Saint Augustine"", the article should at least have 250 words","Restless Heart: The Confessions of Saint Augustine (distributed in the US as: Augustine: The Decline of the Roman Empire, Italian: Sant'Agostino) is a 2010 two-part television miniseries chronicling the life of St. Augustine, the early Christian theologian, writer and Bishop of Hippo Regius at the time of the Vandal invasion (AD 430). 

This series was directed by Christian Duguay and was shot on location in Tunisia.

Plot
In 430 AD, in the besieged city of Hippo, the seventy year-old bishop Augustine tells Jovinus, a captain of the Roman guards, the story of how his Christian mother, Monica, saved him. Born in the North African city of Thagaste, Augustine studied in Carthage, becoming an accomplished but dissolute orator. After converting to Manichaeism, a guiltfree religion, he was called to the imperial court in Milan to serve as an opponent to the Christian bishop Ambrose. But when the Empress Justina sends imperial guards to clear out a basilica where Augustine's own mother is worshipping, he is won over to Christianity. Back in Hippo, Augustine urges the Roman garrison to negotiate with the Vandal King Genseric, but they proudly refuse. At that point, he too, passing up a chance to escape on a ship sent to rescue him by the Pope, stays by the side of his people.

Italian television miniseries
Television series set in the 5th century"," Restless Heart: The Confessions of Saint Augustine Restless Heart: The Confessions of Saint Augustine is an opera by the Scottish composer James MacMillan with a multilingual text by the Irish poet and playwright Seamus Heaney. The work was jointly commissioned by the Royal Opera House, London, the Edinburgh International Festival, and the Brooklyn Academy of Music for the New York City Opera. The opera is based on the life and writings of Saint Augustine, the early Christian theologian and philosopher. The work is structured in two parts. The first part is based on the ""Confessions"" and tells of Augustine's abandonment of his lover, his mother, and his home, and his journey to Rome to convert to Christianity. The second part draws on the ""City of God"" and centres on the conflict between the forces of Heaven and the forces of Hell, as described in the ""City of God"", for the soul of Augustine. The opera was first performed at the Royal Opera House, London, on 27 September 2008, with Vladimir Jurowski conducting the orchestra and chorus of the Royal Opera House. The production was directed by Richard Jones, with sets designed by Jeremy Herbert. The role of Saint Augustine was sung by the American tenor Rolando Villazón. Restless Heart was given its United States premiere on 2 October 2008 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, New York City, with the New York City Opera. This production was directed by Christopher Alden and conducted by Michael Christie. The role of Saint Augustine was sung by the Mexican tenor Rolando Rosales. Restless Heart: The Confessions of Saint Augustine received its European premiere at the Edinburgh International Festival on 23 August 2009, with the Scottish Chamber Orchestra and the Edinburgh Festival Chorus, conducted by Andrew Davis. The production was directed by David McVicar and designed by David Korins. The role of Saint Augustine was sung by the American tenor William Burden. In 2009, the Sydney Theatre Company mounted a production of the opera at the Sydney Opera House, with the English director Richard Jones making his Sydney debut. The production was conducted by Jonathan Dove, and the role of Saint Augustine was sung by the British tenor John Mark Ainsley.",wikipedia-20220301.en,cohere-xlarge-nightly,28833735,0.020253164556962022,0.14736842105263157,0.12607889859676993,0.32554517133956384,1,2,1,0,2,0,0,1,0,1,0.028048733852543275,0.033108059683130034,0.008008837337752003,0.029484029484029485,4,1,3,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3,1,10,1,1,1
"Write a Wikipedia article with the title ""The Living Christ Series"", the article should at least have 250 words","The Living Christ Series is a 1951 12-part drama television series about the life of Jesus Christ directed by John T. Coyle.

Plot
A television mini-series told the life of Christ in a version of the typical Hollywood serial film. Each episode was thirty minutes long, bringing the total running time of the series to what might have been considered an epic six hours long if the films had been shown consecutively. Filmed in color in 1951, it is notable for being one of the few American film series of that time in which Christ's face was actually shown. Since the early days of sound, American film producers had been afraid that some members of the audience would be alienated if an actor who did not fit the public's image of Christ was chosen to play the role, so virtually all had played it safe by showing Him only from the back or in long shot. Sometimes only Christ's hand would be seen. Foreign film makers, however, had no such doubts, and Christ was actually shown in such films as the French Golgotha (1935), the Mexican El Martir del Calvario (1952), and the 1953 British serial Jesus of Nazareth.

However, The Living Christ Series was not meant to be shown in movie theatres, but more as an instructional, inspirational film in churches or on Sunday-morning television. Far from being a religious epic, the series was clearly shot mostly on soundstages and on a low budget, much like a typical television program of the era shot on film. Directed by John T. Coyle, the series featured mostly unknown actors or actors who appeared mostly in B-films. A notable exception was Lowell Gilmore, who played Pontius Pilate, and whose most famous previous role was as Basil Hallward in MGM's classic 1945 film The Picture of Dorian Gray. Character actor Lawrence Dobkin also appeared in the series, and Will Wright, perhaps most famous for appearing as Ben Weaver on several episodes of The Andy Griffith Show, was cast as Herod. Martin Balsam also plays a small role. Screen unknown Robert Wilson, who would go on to practically make a career out of playing the role, portrayed Christ. Noted movie trailer announcer Art Gilmore served as narrator.

The Living Christ Series, like other similar religiously-themed films, was released by Cathedral Films. It has been released on VHS and DVD, both in separate volumes and in a boxed set.
