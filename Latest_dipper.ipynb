We consider two different models for such systems:  The first model describes an ensemble of interacting fermions on a chain; it can be viewed as a generalization of the Hubbard model (which corresponds to spinless fermions) to include spin-dependent hopping amplitudes and repulsive interaction terms.  In this case we show that there exists a critical value U_c of the interaction strength above which the ground state energy per particle becomes negative.  This result implies that the ground state of the system undergoes a phase transition at U = U_c from a metallic-like phase into an insulating phase.   The second model considered here consists of bosons moving along a ring subject to periodic boundary conditions.  Here we prove rigorously that the ground-state energy per particle converges to zero when the number N of particles tends to infinity.  Moreover, we provide upper bounds on the rate of convergence towards the limit.  These results imply that the ground state of our system exhibits superfluid behavior.', 'paraphrased_abstract': 'The second model is a boson, moving along a ring, and we prove that the energy of the particle is zero when the number N of particles reaches infinite.

These networks consist of chemical species which interact through chemical reactions. A mathematical description of these interactions leads to a set of ordinary differential equations known as the kinetic equations.

It consists of three elementary reactions given by \\nwhere k + i and k − i denote respectively the forward and backward rate constants associated with the ith reaction. If the concentrations of the reactants and products involved in the above scheme are denoted by [S] , [E] , [P ] and [C] then the corresponding kinetic equations read dS dt = k 2 [E][S] − k −1 [S],\\ndE dt = k 3 [E][P ] − k −2 [E],\\n\\ndC dt = k 4 [C][P ] − k −3 [C].\\n\\nThe parameters k i represent the rates of the different reactions.

Compared with conventional Navier-Stokes solvers, these approaches are more accurate at capturing complex flow phenomena such as shocks [4] , turbulence [5] , and interfacial flows [6] . Among them, the lattice Boltzmann method [7, 8] has attracted much attention due to its simplicity and efficiency [9] . \\n \\n However, it should be noted that most existing LB models do not satisfy the second law of thermodynamic [10] . This problem becomes particularly severe when dealing with high Mach number flows [11] . To overcome this difficulty, several attempts have been made recently [12–18] . For example, Chen et al. [12] introduced a modified BGK-type collision term which recovers the correct equilibrium state while satisfying the second law of thermodynamical. Similarly, Yu et al. [13] developed another type of entropy-consistent LB schemes using the concept of entropic moments. More recently, Shan et al. [14] presented a novel LB model where the relaxation time was determined according to the local Knudsen number. Although these works provide promising results, they all require additional information about the macroscopic variables, e.g., pressure and velocity fields. As a result, their applications may be limited to simple cases involving only one component gas. \\n \\n In contrast, we propose here a general framework for constructing entropy-consistent LB models. Our strategy relies on adding', 'paraphrased_abstract': 'This, however, is a comparatively new process, and the basic result is not yet complete. There are a few such methods, but the ones we present are more complete and efficient, and they are usually applied to the complicated problems of fluid dynamics, such as shocks, turbulences and eddy currents. We propose, however, a general method for constructing a LB model, with the help of the entropy-limiting factors. Then we describe a novel LB model that, by introducing entropy-limiting factors into the collision operator, reproduces the correct equilibrium, and thereby obtains the second law of thermodynamics. However, the LB model does not, for the most part, satisfy the second law of thermodynamics. For example, Chen et al. introduces a modified BGK-based collision term, which reproduces the true equilibrium and achieves the second law of thermodynamics. We further show that our LB model can reproduce the corresponding equilibrium and correct the second law of thermodynamics for single-phase flows with constant density and temperature, and for multi-phase flows with phase change. We add the concept of entropic moments to the collision operator and obtain the correct equilibrium and the second law of thermodynamics.

We consider both kinetic and fluid descriptions for the dynamics of collisionless plasmas, which are relevant for many space and laboratory applications. In this context we investigate the nonlinear evolution of magnetic fluctuations by means of direct numerical simulations (DNS) of the Vlasov-Maxwell system. The main results can be summarized as follows:  1. Turbulence statistics -We perform DNSs of the Vlasov-Poisson system in order to characterize the statistical properties of the electrostatic potential fluctuations generated by an initial spectrum of Alfvenic modes. Our analysis shows that the energy cascade proceeds towards smaller spatial scales until it reaches the ion Larmor radius scale where it is transferred into perpendicular wavenumbers through Landau damping. At these small scales, the energy transfer rate decreases due to the reduction of phase correlations between wavevectors. This process leads to the formation of intermittency in the distribution function of particles.  2. Kinetic effects -In addition to the above mentioned features observed in the case of purely hydrodynamic turbulence, our results show that kinetic effects play also an important role in determining the statistical properties of the fluctuating fields. Indeed, we find that the presence of ions modifies significantly the shape of the probability density functions (PDFs), leading to non-Gaussian distributions characterized by tails extending over several orders of magnitude. Moreover, we observe that the PDFs become more skewed when increasing the value of the ion-to-electron mass ratio.

This method is composed of two parts, a series of AE signals separated from each other, and the corresponding components are combined to find the locations of several AE events with high accuracy. This is a result of the efforts of several researchers, including Liu Liu, who has created a new technique, called 'Time-frequency Analysis,' which can be used to separate different AE sources, but it requires a good knowledge of the number of AE sources in each measurement channel, and a great deal of experience in choosing the right parameters. The main point is that AEs can be detected at any time, even when the source is at a close time, or when the waveform is a close one. \", 'model': 'bigscience bloomz', 'source': 'arxiv'}, {'source_id': 704.0053, 'title': 'A Global Approach to the Theory of Special Finsler Manifolds', 'abstract': '  The aim of the present paper is to provide a global presentation of the\\ntheory of special Finsler manifolds.

In addition we discuss how our results generalize to higher dimensions. Introduction: Supersymmetric field theories have been studied extensively over last decades due to their remarkable properties such as unitarity and renormalizability [1, 2] . One of the most important features of supersymmetric models is the presence of fermionic partners of bosonic degrees of freedom with opposite statistics. These new particles lead to additional symmetries called supersymmetries. It has been shown that all known fundamental interactions including gravity can be described within the framework of supersymmetric quantum mechanics [3] .\\nIn recent years there was renewed interest in supersymmetric field theories motivated by developments in string/M-theory [4] , where they appear naturally on various brane configurations [5] . Moreover, it turns out that many interesting phenomena observed at high energies may find natural explanation within the context of supersymmetric extensions of Standard Model [6] . For example, supersymmetry provides elegant solution to hierarchy problem [7, 8] or offers possible candidates for dark matter [9] .\\nThe simplest supersymmetric extension of Standard Model contains only one extra spin-1/2 particle -the gravitino [10] . However, more complicated versions involving several spin-1/2 fields exist [11] . A particularly interesting class of supersymmetric models involves so-called extended supersymmetry [12] . This includes N = 2 supersymmetry [13] , which appears in M-theory compactified on Calabi-Yau manifolds [14] , and its further generalization to N = 4 [15] . Another interesting case corresponds to N = 1 supersymmetry [16] , which arises when D-branes wrap cycles of internal space [17] .', 'paraphrased_abstract': 'The most interesting of these is the N-two supersymmetry, which occurs naturally in M-theory on Calabi-Yau manifolds, and its extension to N- 4 superstructures. Another example is N-1/2 supersymmetry, which arises in a D-brane with internal space. Supersymmetry is a most interesting theory, because of its remarkable properties, such as it is unitar and renormalizable. It has been demonstrated that all the known fundamental interactions with gravity can be formulated in supersymmetric quantum mechanics. This is due to the fact that the supersymmetric quantum mechanics can be interpreted, for example, by supersymmetric quantum mechanics. Recently, a renewed interest in supersymmetric quantum mechanics was motivated by developments in string and M-theory, which are naturally found in various brane configurations. There is a new unified supersymmetric theory, which is based on the addition of fermionic partners of opposite properties, which lead to supersymmetric symmetries, called supersymbols. Another interesting supersymmetric model is the N-supersymmetry, which arises from a supersymmetric N-supersymmetry, which is formulated in chiral N-superfields. In this way, we will also describe the generalization of the theory to higher dimensions. In addition, we will discuss how our results will be', 'model': 'bigscience bloomz', 'source': 'arxiv'}, {'source_id': 704.0065, 'title': 'Littlewood-Richardson polynomials', 'abstract': '  We introduce a family of rings of symmetric functions depending on an\\ninfinite sequence of parameters.

The former tends to smooth out the QD density profile while the latter leads to its steepening.

They can be used in optoelectronic devices such as light-emitting diodes [2] , lasers [3] , solar cells [4] , photodetectors [5] , etc., and they may even play important roles in biological systems [6] .\\n \\nThe most common method for growing QDs is based on the so-called Stranski-Krastanov process [7, 8] . It involves depositing a thin layer of material onto a substrate at high temperatures followed by annealing at lower temperatures. Under these conditions islands nucleate randomly over the entire sample area but then evolve into ordered arrays through Ostwald ripening [9] . However, this technique does not allow one to control the position of individual QDs within each array [10] . Recently developed methods [11, 12] enable us to produce highly ordered QD arrays; however, they require very precise temperature control during deposition [13] . \\n \\n 2 Model Description \\n \\n Here we consider a model describing the formation of QDs on a two-dimensional lattice. Our starting point is the continuum equation proposed by Tersoff et al.

We have found that the order of the QDs is determined by two competing mechanisms: surface diffusion and strain relaxation, the order of the density, the size of the pixel, the strength of the pixel, and the resolving of the pixel. This is why it is so difficult to produce the ordered QDs with large sizes. We have applied a classical approach, and here we take the equation of the continuum. This is called the Continent-Dolmens-Krastanov process. This technique is used to deposit a thin layer of material on a substrate, annealing at lower temperatures, and the forming of a regular array. This technique does not allow you to control the positions of the individual QDs in each array. The first method is the Stranski-Krastanov method, which is used to grow qubits, but in a regular array, as well as the method of growing them by molecular beam epitaxy, which, in general, can grow QDs spontaneously.

INTRODUCTORY REMARkS\\nThe recent experimental realization of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) in dilute atomic gases has opened up new possibilities for studying quantum phenomena at the macroscopic level [1] . One of the most interesting features observed experimentally is the existence of solitary waves known as \"bright solitons\" [2] , which have been predicted theoretically [3] .\\nIn this work we consider a model describing spin-1 bosons trapped inside a magnetic trap [4] . This problem was first studied numerically in Ref. [5] where it was shown that there exists a family of localized solutions whose properties depend strongly on the orientation of the external magnetic field. It turns out that some of them correspond to stable configurations [6] . However, all previous studies were performed within the mean-field approximation neglecting fluctuations around the ground state [7, 8] . Here we perform a detailed investigation of the full many-body problem using both analytical and numerical methods.', 'paraphrased_abstract': 'In Ref., the authors found that there are several different solutions to the problem, which depend strongly on the angle of the magnetic field. In general, all the previous studies were performed on the equilateral plane and did not take into account fluctuations in the ground state. In this work we describe the theory of spin-bosons in a magnetic trap. During the first experiments of BEC in dilute atoms, it was discovered that the existence of solitary waves, called “bright solitons” was observed experimentally, and was thereby predicted theoretically. We also studied the formation and dynamics of the bright solitons in spin-bosons, based on the Gross-Pitaevsky equation for the macroscopic wave function, and the Schrödinger equation for the magnetization vector, and showed that one of these solutions was always unstable, while the other, depending on the state of the system, was stable, or unstable depending on the value of the system parameters. We also studied the dynamics of the solitons in the trap, which are based on the Gross-Pitaevsky equation for the macroscopic wave function, and the Schrödinger equation for the magnetization vector, which is not linear, and we showed that stable solitons exist only when the background density is finite.

They consist of macroscopic particles (grains) which interact via dissipative collisions [2] , i.e., the normal component of the relative velocity after collision differs from its value before collision due to dissipation [3] . A typical example is sand or glass beads [4] .\\nThe dynamics of such systems has attracted considerable interest recently because it exhibits features not found in ordinary fluids [5] . For instance, there exist stationary states where the average particle velocities do not vanish [6] . Moreover, these states may exhibit nontrivial correlations between different degrees of freedom [7, 8] . Another interesting feature is the formation of clusters [9] . It was shown experimentally [10] that even dilute granular gases cool down faster than predicted by molecular chaos [11] . This effect cannot be explained by standard Boltzmann kinetics [12] . Instead, more sophisticated approaches like Enskog [13] or Sonine [14] expansions [15] were developed [16] . However, all these theories assume elastic interactions [17] .

The most notable of these is the formation of clusters. In recent times, a number of authors have investigated the influence of inelasticity on the properties of granular materials by means of computer simulations. They have analyzed the behavior of these systems with an explicit solution of the time-varying function of the one particle distribution and the pressure tensor in a simple, free, elastic hard sphere, with constant restitution coefficient. This is shown by the presence of peaks which are constantly resolving, and which in turn are exponentially decreasing. Hence we have a dynamically derived formulation of the time-varying function of the density-weight function and the pressure-tensor for free, elastic hard spheres with constant restitution coefficient.

They could play an important role in cosmology because they might generate various interesting phenomena such as gravitational wave bursts [3] , gamma ray bursts [4] , ultra-high energy cosmic rays [5] , and so on [6] - [8] .\\n \\nIn this letter, we focus our attention on gravitational waves (GWs), which would be emitted during the formation process of cosmic string loops [9] . If there exist many small loops, then the total amount of GW emission will increase significantly [10] . Therefore, it should be very important to know how much GWs are emitted when loops form [11] . \\n \\n Recently, several authors [12] - [14] investigated the production rate of GWs from cosmic string loops using numerical simulations. However, these works did not take into account the effect of loop self-intersection [15] . It was shown [16] that loop self-intersections lead to significant changes in the evolution of loop sizes [17] . Thus, one cannot ignore them even though the probability of loop self intersection decreases rapidly with increasing loop length [18] .', 'paraphrased_abstract': ', and the radiance of the PBH in the first loops of the cosmic strings, as they are formed, is greatly increased, resulting in a resemblance to the equilibration of the rays. Then, it must be noted that the equilibration of a loop must be investigated, and the probability of its self-intersection must be increased, especially as the number of loops increases. It is not known whether the equilibration of a loop in the first loops has been estimated, but it is not known whether the distribution of a loop has been studied. Cosmic waves have been studied in great detail since they were first proposed, and they may play an important role in the cosmology of cosmology, because they are capable of generating many unforeseen phenomena, such as gravitational waves, gamma rays, ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, and so on. Moreover, it is well established that when a loop is created, the density of PBH is greatly reduced. Moreover, if the number of loops is large, then the mass of PBH is a significant increase.

This task has been traditionally performed using codes that solve statistical equilibrium equations separately for each level of interest. Such methods require repeated iterations over many different models until convergence is reached.

For example, it takes more than two days to analyze a typical spectrum consisting of thousands of transitions using the most advanced available software package Cloudy [1] . \\nIn order to overcome this problem we developed a new computational tool called SPEX [2] , which combines the advantages of both the accelerated lambda iteration [3] and opacity sampling [4] techniques.

If we want to measure something precisely enough, then we should make sure that there is no correlation between successive measurements made on the same object [1] . For example, if we have a device which measures the temperature of water at room temperature T = 20 °C , then we would like to obtain values close to 20 ± 0.1°C when repeating the measurement many times [2] .\\n \\nIn practice, however, such repeatability cannot always be achieved because of various factors affecting the measurement process [3] . Therefore, before starting any research work, you must determine whether your measuring equipment meets all requirements [4] . \\n \\n 2 Problem statement \\n \\n Let X be a continuous random variable describing the result of a single measurement performed under certain conditions [5] . We assume that the distribution function F(x) of X has been determined experimentally [6] . Then the question arises - how many independent measurements do we need to perform so that the average deviation of the measured values does not exceed a specified threshold ?', 'paraphrased_abstract': \"We have to determine, by means of an experiment, the number of independent measurements required, and to calculate the equivalence of the various independent measurements. This is the problem we have to solve: Suppose X is a continuous random variable, that is, an outcome of a single measurement, and we assume a distribution of F (x) in the first place. In this sense, we have to estimate the number of independent measurements. It is necessary to determine the equivalence of the individual measurements, and the average deviation of the measurements will not exceed the specified threshold. Moreover, the study of the data will be complicated, because some statistical properties are unknown to us. Hence it is necessary to determine the quantity of each of the independent measurements and the proportion of them that is equal to the sum of their average. This is a problem for which we need to know the extent of the precision of our instrument. For instance, if a device measures the temperature of water at room temperature, T = 20°C, we would like to obtain results of 20 0.1°C if the measurement is repeated many times. This is the method, and it will be used for planning experiments with minimal error or for estimating the accuracy of existing experiments.

Depending upon these two parameters there exist several distinct families of carbon nanotubes [10] . In general, carbon nanotubes can be divided into two categories namely zigzag tubes and armchair tubes [11] . Zigzag tubes consist of alternating double bonds along its axis whereas armchair tubes contain only single bonds [12] . There exists another type called chiral tube whose helicity lies somewhere between zigzag and armchair tubes [13] . These tubes are characterized by a pair of integers (n,m), where n denotes number of unit cells in circumference direction and m represents number of unit cells in longitudinal direction [14] . For example, (5, 5) , (6, 6), (7, 7) and (8, 4) represent zigzag, armchair, chiral and achiral tubes respectively [15] .\", 'paraphrased_abstract': 'The structure is based on the synthesis of sp2 hybridized carbon, which has unique physical and chemical properties.

The tensile properties of SWCNTs are based on the temperature difference and the degree of elasticity. The tensile strength of SWCNTs is measured by the proportion of their thickness and the number of their diameter. The tensile strength of SWCNTs is based on the number of their circumference and the number of their length, respectively.

The results presented here were obtained during my PhD thesis at ETH Zurich under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Peter Schupp (ETH Zurich) and Prof. Dr. Michael Steinert (University of Hamburg).    Keywords: Group theory, Monoids, Automata, Decidability, Word problem, Free inverse monoids, Finite automata, Computational complexity theory, Groups generated by finite automata, Generalized Thompson groups, Elementary amenable groups, Group actions on trees, Group actions on graphs', 'paraphrased_abstract': 'The results presented herein were obtained during my dissertation project at the ETH Zurich under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Peter Schupp (ETH Zurich) and Prof. Michael Steinert (University of Hamburg). We introduce a class of generalized groups, derived from the classical groups of Richard Thompson. We show how to build these groups using finite automata, and demonstrate that they can be incorporated in inverse groupings. We introduce monoids that generalize the classical groups of Richard Thompson and introduce an algorithm for the construction of these groups, based on finite automata. We describe all elements in the normal form of all elements in the system of monoids. We also give a detailed account of the normal form of all elements, for example of the normal forms of the elements that are derived from monoids.

We consider two different models for such systems:  The first model describes an ensemble of interacting fermions on a chain; it can be viewed as a generalization of the Hubbard model (which corresponds to spinless fermions) to include spin-dependent hopping amplitudes and repulsive interaction terms.  In this case we show that there exists a critical value U_c of the interaction strength above which the ground state energy per particle becomes negative.  This result implies that the ground state of the system undergoes a phase transition at U = U_c from a metallic-like phase into an insulating phase.   The second model considered here consists of bosons moving along a ring subject to periodic boundary conditions.  Here we prove rigorously that the ground-state energy per particle converges to zero when the number N of particles tends to infinity.  Moreover, we provide upper bounds on the rate of convergence towards the limit.  These results imply that the ground state of our system exhibits superfluid behavior.', 'paraphrased_abstract': 'In this paper we examine two different aspects of the relationship between the ordinary Schroedinger theory and the polymer theory.

We prove strong convergence rates under suitable conditions. Finally we illustrate our results by several examples including nonlinear filtering problems. Stochastic differential equations (SDEs), especially those arising from applications such as mathematical finance or statistical physics, often involve state variables taking values in some Lie group G. In this case it is natural to consider solutions in terms of left-invariant vector fields on G.

ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array) will be able to observe this region for the first time with unprecedented spatial resolution.   This talk will discuss some of the science that can be done using ALMA observations of the Solar Chromosphere. The Solar Chromosphere is one of the most enigmatic regions of the Sun. It lies between the photosphere and corona, and plays a crucial role in energy transport into the upper atmosphere. However, due to its extremely low density, direct observation of the chromosphere was not possible until recently when high-resolution images were obtained by space-based telescopes such as Hinode/SOT and SDO/AIA. In addition, ground-based observatories have also made significant progress towards studying the chromosphere through various techniques including spectropolarimetry, imaging spectroscopy, and speckle interferometry. Despite these advances, there are still many open questions about the physical processes occurring within the chromosphere which need to be addressed. For example, what causes the formation of dynamic structures like sunspots? How do magnetic fields affect plasma dynamics in the chromosphere? What is the relationship between chromospheric heating mechanisms and coronal mass ejections? These questions cannot be answered without detailed knowledge of the structure and dynamics of the chromosphere. To address them we require new observational data at higher spatial resolutions than ever before.', 'paraphrased_abstract': 'The chromatograms whose axis is 3.5mm, whose length is twelve arcsec, reveal oscillations with amplitudes of 150-150 K and amplitudes of 1.5-1.8 mHz, with a tendency to shorten periods in the network and to longer periods in the network. But higher resolution, such as the one obtainable by ALMA, is necessary to distinguish the features in the solar atmosphere clearly and to compare them with the corresponding results of the comprehensive physico-chemical models. These results indicate that the nature of the solar chromosphere, its structure and dynamics, remains insufficiently understood. This is why we are presenting a numerical solution to this long-standing problem. Our work with the model of the chromosphere by Carlsson and Stein demonstrates that the emission at millimetres is extremely sensitive to the dynamic phenomena in the chromosphere, and that the appropriate wavelengths to look for these signatures are in the range of 0.8 to 5.0 mm.

These networks consist of chemical species which interact through chemical reactions. A mathematical description of these interactions leads to a set of ordinary differential equations known as the kinetic equations. For example, the Michaelis-Menten mechanism describes how an enzyme E binds reversibly to its substrate S to form a complex C before releasing product P . It consists of three elementary reactions given by \\nwhere k + i and k − i denote respectively the forward and backward rate constants associated with the ith reaction. If the concentrations of the reactants and products involved in the above scheme are denoted by [S] , [E] , [P ] and [C] then the corresponding kinetic equations read dS dt = k 2 [E][S] − k −1 [S],\\ndE dt = k 3 [E][P ] − k −2 [E],\\n\\ndC dt = k 4 [C][P ] − k −3 [C].\\n\\nThe parameters k i represent the rates of the different reactions.

Compared with conventional Navier-Stokes solvers, these approaches are more accurate at capturing complex flow phenomena such as shocks [4] , turbulence [5] , and interfacial flows [6] . Among them, the lattice Boltzmann method [7, 8] has attracted much attention due to its simplicity and efficiency [9] . \\n \\n However, it should be noted that most existing LB models do not satisfy the second law of thermodynamic [10] . This problem becomes particularly severe when dealing with high Mach number flows [11] . To overcome this difficulty, several attempts have been made recently [12–18] . For example, Chen et al. [12] introduced a modified BGK-type collision term which recovers the correct equilibrium state while satisfying the second law of thermodynamical. Similarly, Yu et al. [13] developed another type of entropy-consistent LB schemes using the concept of entropic moments. More recently, Shan et al. [14] presented a novel LB model where the relaxation time was determined according to the local Knudsen number. Although these works provide promising results, they all require additional information about the macroscopic variables, e.g., pressure and velocity fields. As a result, their applications may be limited to simple cases involving only one component gas. \\n \\n In contrast, we propose here a general framework for constructing entropy-consistent LB models. Our strategy relies on adding', 'paraphrased_abstract': 'They are used to create an equilibrium between entropy and non-entropy, and to produce a balanced and accurate estimate of the natural dissipation. The physical properties of the material are also advantageous. The control of entropy production and the accurate estimation of the artificial dissipation are achieved. We have a system of equilibrium between the two extremes of the Boltzmann Method and the LBM of the athermal and athermal shocks, with a density ratio of 1:2, and a cavity of 2D with Reynolds numbers of Re between 2000 and 7500, in a coarse 100-100 grid. The equilibrium of the two shocks is a non-zero-equilibrium limiter, but the constraint of the equilibrium is a non-zero-equilibrium limiter. In general, these limits do the same thing for LBM as for the finite differences, volumes and elements, but for LBM the main idea is to transform the field into a scalar quantity, that is, non-zero-equilibrium. In general, they do the same thing for the equilibrium of the lattice Boltzmann methods, as well as for the flux limiter for finite differences, volumes and elements.

We consider both kinetic and fluid descriptions for the dynamics of collisionless plasmas, which are relevant for many space and laboratory applications. In this context we investigate the nonlinear evolution of magnetic fluctuations by means of direct numerical simulations (DNS) of the Vlasov-Maxwell system. The main results can be summarized as follows:  1. Turbulence statistics -We perform DNSs of the Vlasov-Poisson system in order to characterize the statistical properties of the electrostatic potential fluctuations generated by an initial spectrum of Alfvenic modes. Our analysis shows that the energy cascade proceeds towards smaller spatial scales until it reaches the ion Larmor radius scale where it is transferred into perpendicular wavenumbers through Landau damping. At these small scales, the energy transfer rate decreases due to the reduction of phase correlations between wavevectors. This process leads to the formation of intermittency in the distribution function of particles.  2. Kinetic effects -In addition to the above mentioned features observed in the case of purely hydrodynamic turbulence, our results show that kinetic effects play also an important role in determining the statistical properties of the fluctuating fields. Indeed, we find that the presence of ions modifies significantly the shape of the probability density functions (PDFs), leading to non-Gaussian distributions characterized by tails extending over several orders of magnitude. Moreover, we observe that the PDFs become more skewed when increasing the value of the ion-to-electron mass ratio.

Introduction: Supersymmetric field theories have been studied extensively over last decades due to their remarkable properties such as unitarity and renormalizability [1, 2] . One of the most important features of supersymmetric models is the presence of fermionic partners of bosonic degrees of freedom with opposite statistics. These new particles lead to additional symmetries called supersymmetries. It has been shown that all known fundamental interactions including gravity can be described within the framework of supersymmetric quantum mechanics [3] .\\nIn recent years there was renewed interest in supersymmetric field theories motivated by developments in string/M-theory [4] , where they appear naturally on various brane configurations [5] . Moreover, it turns out that many interesting phenomena observed at high energies may find natural explanation within the context of supersymmetric extensions of Standard Model [6] . For example, supersymmetry provides elegant solution to hierarchy problem [7, 8] or offers possible candidates for dark matter [9] .\\nThe simplest supersymmetric extension of Standard Model contains only one extra spin-1/2 particle -the gravitino [10] . However, more complicated versions involving several spin-1/2 fields exist [11] . A particularly interesting class of supersymmetric models involves so-called extended supersymmetry [12] . This includes N = 2 supersymmetry [13] , which appears in M-theory compactified on Calabi-Yau manifolds [14] , and its further generalization to N = 4 [15] . Another interesting case corresponds to N = 1 supersymmetry [16] , which arises when D-branes wrap cycles of internal space [17] .', 'paraphrased_abstract': 'Then, we discuss, in detail, the interpretation of the above nilpotent and the anti-nilpotent symmetry of the four (3+1)-dimensional (4, 2)-dimensional gauge theories, which are regarded, on the 4D (non-Abelian) gauge theories, in the sense of the superfield. We enumerate the indefinitely infinite and the indefinitely infinite Densities of the Four Dimensions of the 4D gauge theories, with a Grassmannian Variables Xu and a Barometric Variable Xu, which we have derived from the Four Dimensions of the Superfield Formalism, and which, moreover, we are referring to. We show the off-shell and the on-shell Densities of the Lagrangian Densities of the Four Dimensions of the 4D Gauss Theories in the context of the super-field formalism.

It involves depositing a thin layer of material onto a substrate at high temperatures followed by annealing at lower temperatures. Under these conditions islands nucleate randomly over the entire sample area but then evolve into ordered arrays through Ostwald ripening [9] . However, this technique does not allow one to control the position of individual QDs within each array [10] . Recently developed methods [11, 12] enable us to produce highly ordered QD arrays; however, they require very precise temperature control during deposition [13] . \\n \\n 2 Model Description \\n \\n Here we consider a model describing the formation of QDs on a two-dimensional lattice.

However, we show that this effect is counteracted by two competing processes: dynamical friction which removes massive stars more efficiently than less massive ones; and relaxation-driven core collapse which increases the central density of the cluster and makes it harder for massive stars to escape. The net result depends strongly on the initial concentration of the cluster, but typically leads to shallower slopes compared to those observed in real GCs.

INTRODUCTORY REMARkS\\nThe recent experimental realization of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) in dilute atomic gases has opened up new possibilities for studying quantum phenomena at the macroscopic level [1] . One of the most interesting features observed experimentally is the existence of solitary waves known as \"bright solitons\" [2] , which have been predicted theoretically [3] .\\nIn this work we consider a model describing spin-1 bosons trapped inside a magnetic trap [4] . This problem was first studied numerically in Ref. [5] where it was shown that there exists a family of localized solutions whose properties depend strongly on the orientation of the external magnetic field. It turns out that some of them correspond to stable configurations [6] . However, all previous studies were performed within the mean-field approximation neglecting fluctuations around the ground state [7, 8] . Here we perform a detailed investigation of the full many-body problem using both analytical and numerical methods.', 'paraphrased_abstract': 'This result was consistent with the results obtained in previous studies for bright solitons under vanishing boundaries, and with dark solitons under vanishing boundaries. In this study we investigate the dynamical properties of solitons with finite backgrounds in the BEC of the F-Zir, based on an integrable spinor model, equivalent to the Schrodinger equation with a self-focusing nonlinearity. The resulting soliton solutions were described in a specific way, and are of a specific type: a domain-wall and a phase-shift type, a ferromagnetic state with no total spin, a polar state with no spin, and a polar state with no spin. Moreover, the spin-mixing phenomenon was confirmed in a collision between the two types.

PACS numbers: 05.40.+j, 47.27.-i Granular materials have been studied extensively over many years [1] . They consist of macroscopic particles (grains) which interact via dissipative collisions [2] , i.e., the normal component of the relative velocity after collision differs from its value before collision due to dissipation [3] . A typical example is sand or glass beads [4] .\\nThe dynamics of such systems has attracted considerable interest recently because it exhibits features not found in ordinary fluids [5] . For instance, there exist stationary states where the average particle velocities do not vanish [6] . Moreover, these states may exhibit nontrivial correlations between different degrees of freedom [7, 8] . Another interesting feature is the formation of clusters [9] . It was shown experimentally [10] that even dilute granular gases cool down faster than predicted by molecular chaos [11] . This effect cannot be explained by standard Boltzmann kinetics [12] . Instead, more sophisticated approaches like Enskog [13] or Sonine [14] expansions [15] were developed [16] . However, all these theories assume elastic interactions [17] . Recently, several authors [18, 19] investigated the influence of inelasticity on the properties of granular matter using computer simulations [20] .', 'paraphrased_abstract': 'Then we solve the ideal hydrodynamic equations numerically. We obtain an exact solution to the problem of small amplitudes of one dimension, and we prove the stability of the solution. The density of a gas increases at the point of a moment when the initial conditions are a perfectly smooth one.

Moreover, numerical solutions show that the local features of a gas increase universally, without regard for the details of the initial and boundary conditions. We take the granular approach to a complex problem of the formation of particles in a liquid gas that is freely cooling, but which has no viscosity. We use Lagrangian coordinates and derive a wide class of precise analytical solutions, involving only one spatial coordinate. The calculations of the ideal hydrodynamic equations show that a gas of the same type may coexist with an ordinary shock, at which the hydrodynamic field is discontinuous but finite. The temperature passes away at the singularity, and the singularity follows the isobaric model, where the pressure is a constant and nearly uniform in space and constant in time.

If there exist many small loops, then the total amount of GW emission will increase significantly [10] . Therefore, it should be very important to know how much GWs are emitted when loops form [11] . \\n \\n Recently, several authors [12] - [14] investigated the production rate of GWs from cosmic string loops using numerical simulations. However, these works did not take into account the effect of loop self-intersection [15] . It was shown [16] that loop self-intersections lead to significant changes in the evolution of loop sizes [17] .

The results of this physics can be reproduced by using conformal field theory. The results of this study are also generalized to the Neveu-Schwarz sector of superstrings. We study a universal property of any covariant field theory in a space which is populated by pp-waves, and show that the lagrangian density which is examined with a limited set of field conditions, called the universal sector, is identical around all pp-waves, even the pp-waves of the other side, with the same radii and the same profiles for the scalars. This property is a property of all covariant fields extending in a space that is populated by pp-waves. For example, the pp-waves of the other side are called the universal sector, and their correlation functions are insensitive to the pp-wave nature of the metric and the scalar flux.

This information is encoded in the location of the so-called Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO), i.e., the smallest possible radius r ISCO of a particle's circular orbit [7, 8] . It turns out that the value of r ISCO depends sensitively on the spin angular momentum J = Ma 2 /(2r g ) of the black hole [9] : if J < M 2 , then r ISCO > 3M ; but when J approaches M 2 , r ISCO decreases rapidly until finally it reaches the Schwarzschild radius R s ≡ 2GM/c 2 [10] .

Our analysis extended this analysis to the whole generic inclination and the eccentricity of nearly horizon-skimming orbits.

These observations provide information about the density structure, kinematics, temperatures, ionization states and elemental abundances of these clouds. However, interpreting such data requires detailed knowledge of atomic physics processes occurring inside them which can be obtained only through sophisticated numerical modeling. This task has been traditionally performed using codes that solve statistical equilibrium equations separately for each level of interest. Such methods require repeated iterations over many different models until convergence is reached. As a result they tend to be very time consuming even when applied to relatively simple problems involving just a few hundred energy levels. For example, it takes more than two days to analyze a typical spectrum consisting of thousands of transitions using the most advanced available software package Cloudy [1] . \\nIn order to overcome this problem we developed a new computational tool called SPEX [2] , which combines the advantages of both the accelerated lambda iteration [3] and opacity sampling [4] techniques.

If we want to measure something precisely enough, then we should make sure that there is no correlation between successive measurements made on the same object [1] . For example, if we have a device which measures the temperature of water at room temperature T = 20 °C , then we would like to obtain values close to 20 ± 0.1°C when repeating the measurement many times [2] .\\n \\nIn practice, however, such repeatability cannot always be achieved because of various factors affecting the measurement process [3] . Therefore, before starting any research work, you must determine whether your measuring equipment meets all requirements [4] . \\n \\n 2 Problem statement \\n \\n Let X be a continuous random variable describing the result of a single measurement performed under certain conditions [5] .

Depending upon these two parameters there exist several distinct families of carbon nanotubes [10] . In general, carbon nanotubes can be divided into two categories namely zigzag tubes and armchair tubes [11] . Zigzag tubes consist of alternating double bonds along its axis whereas armchair tubes contain only single bonds [12] . There exists another type called chiral tube whose helicity lies somewhere between zigzag and armchair tubes [13] . These tubes are characterized by a pair of integers (n,m), where n denotes number of unit cells in circumference direction and m represents number of unit cells in longitudinal direction [14] .

It is complete, but it does not change. In this version, the main results are the same: the sections 1, 2, 3, and 4 are all the same, except for the proof of the theory 2.3, which is incomplete. It is given in the Appendix of Reference. The monoids M-K-K-K-K are congruent for all k. These are submonoids of the multiplicative part of the Cuntz algebra O-k. They are finite, and their word problem is in P-N. Their word problem is co-NP-complete for certain infinite generating sets. The groups G-K-K-K-K-K-K can be generalized to monoids, which we call M-K-K-K-K-K-K, and to inverse monoids, which we call I-K-K-K-K-K, by merely applying the inverse functions to partial functions or to partial injections.

In particular, this approach has been followed in a symmetric\\nsector of loop quantum gravity known as loop quantum cosmology. Here we explore\\ndifferent aspects of the relation between the ordinary Schroedinger theory and\\nthe polymer description. The paper has two parts. In the first one, we derive\\nthe polymer quantum mechanics starting from the ordinary Schroedinger theory\\nand show that the polymer description arises as an appropriate limit. In the\\nsecond part we consider the continuum limit of this theory, namely, the reverse\\nprocess in which one starts from the discrete theory and tries to recover back\\nthe ordinary Schroedinger quantum mechanics. We consider several examples of\\ninterest, including the harmonic oscillator, the free particle and a simple\\ncosmological model.\\n', 'machine_text': 'In this paper, we investigate the continuum limit of polymer quantum mechanics. The aim of our work is to better understand the quantum behavior of polymers and its relationship to the classical theory. Our research attempts to clarify the nature of the continuum limit and determine the correctness of the approximations made. Specifically, we study the connectivity of the polymer strands. We find that a continuous path can be defined in the polymer configuration space, which is essential for the polymer to display continuum behavior. We show that the approximation of continuous randomness in the spatial variable can certainly be used when the polymer is stretched out over a significant distance. For a coil-like polymer, our results demonstrate that its behavior is non-classical.\\n\\nOur methodology involves a careful combination of intuition, formalism, and numerical simulations. We evaluate a path integral representation of polymer quantum mechanics in the continuum limit, and use numerical simulations to support our results. The ideas proposed in this work are relevant to the understanding of the thermodynamic properties of polymers, as well as to quantum computing and information. The findings of this work present a theoretical framework for the investigation of other polymer properties that are still poorly understood.', 'paraphrased_abstract': 'The work that follows is of a practical nature, for the analysis of thermodynamics and of information theory, and for the determination of other properties of polymers. In this paper we will consider the continuum of polymer mechanics in the continuum, and we present an analytical framework for further investigations of other polymer properties that remain unclear. Our aim is to study the behavior of polymers and their relationship to classical theories. We study the ringing of the polymer strands in order to obtain the continuous paths, and to find out how the polymer is stretched over an enormous distance.
