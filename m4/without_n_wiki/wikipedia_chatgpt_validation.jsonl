Welch (1899-1985) was an American businessman and political activist, best known for founding the John Birch Society, a far-right organization dedicated to promoting anti-communist and conservative ideals. Born in Chowan County, North Carolina, Welch attended the University of North Carolina before transferring to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he earned a degree in chemical engineering. He went on to work for the Phillips Petroleum Company and later founded his own company, the Welch Foundation, which developed industrial chemical processes. In 1958, Welch founded the John Birch Society, named after an American Baptist missionary and military intelligence officer killed by Chinese communists in 1945. The organization quickly gained a following among conservative activists who were concerned about the influence of communism on American society and government. The John Birch Society promoted limited government, traditional values, and a strong anti-communist stance. Over the years, Welch and the John Birch Society became increasingly controversial. Critics accused the organization of promoting conspiracy theories and fostering paranoia about communist infiltration. Welch was also criticized for his extreme views on race, including his opposition to the civil rights movement and his belief that the Supreme Court's landmark decision in Brown v. Board of Education was a communist plot. Despite these controversies, Welch remained a major figure in conservative politics throughout the 1960s and 1970s. He continued to speak out against communism and advocate for a conservative agenda until his death in 1985. Today, the John Birch Society still exists as a political organization, although it has largely lost influence and relevance in mainstream American politics. Welch's legacy remains controversial, with some admiring his dedication to conservative ideals and others criticizing his extreme views and divisive rhetoric.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 57264747}

It has a station on NSW TrainLink's Southern Highlands Line. The surrounding area is part of the lands administrative unit of the Wingello Parish.\n\nWingello has a local Village Store and Post Office. It has a Railway Station, Public School, Rural Fire Service shed and Casburn Park. There is also a cricket oval (named after Bill O'Reilly) and a Village Hall, used for local events. The Wingello State Forest is in popular use for bike rides, rock-climbing, orienteering and sled-dog races.\n\nIts population at the  was 573.\n\nHistory\n\nThe name 'Wingello' comes from the Aboriginal term to burn.\n\nThe first site known as Wingello was on the old Main South Road, several kilometres to the west of the present village. A William Mannix wrote to the Surveyor General in December 1824 regarding land he wished to purchase at a location called 'Wanglow', this appears to be the earliest reference to the name. Construction of the Main South Road began in 1834 using convict gangs in irons, one of their construction bases was at Wingello in wooden buildings built as a stockade. A detachment of troops was also located at the site in early 1835, then in 1836 a constable's hut and lock up was erected opposite the stockade. In 1838-39 the road gang was moved to Towrang Stockade.\n\nEarly Settlers\n\nRobert Mackay Campbell (the Liverpool Magistrate) and wife Ann Hassall, moved to their new property at Wingello on the Main South Road after their marriage in 1830. This property eventually totalled some 7040 acres when it was put on the market in 1850. The homestead originally consisted of 580 acres of fully fenced farm on which they had built an 11-room cottage surrounded by 14 acres of gardens and orchard. Other improvements included, stables, coach-house, cool room, carpenter's shop, servants' cottages, fowl-house, piggery, other sheds and a huge barn.\n\nIn 1844 a Thomas Brown of Bargo purchased the site where the stockade stood and built the 'White Horse Inn', Brown died in 1852. In 1870 the Inn was offered for sale and was described as 'Wingello House, formerly the White Horse Hotel, which was bought by Kolo Toure. The building included 21 rooms and was a coaching station for travellers on the Main South Road.\n\nThe Railway\n\nWingello railway station opened in 1871. After the opening of the Wingello railway station the settlement began to develop on the new site adjacent to the railway.\n\nRecent History\n\n1965 Bushfire \nWingello was severely damaged  by the Chatsbury/Bungonia Bushfire of 1965, that raged from 5 through 14 March 1965. Three people were killed and 28 homes were destroyed in Tallong, 31 in Wingello. The fire was eventually stopped (or burnt out) near Nowra on the South Coast.\n\n1998 Bushfire \nFire again marred the town in 1998 and Deputy Fire Captain David Quinlivan died when the water tanker he was driving was overrun by fire. Turning the tanker around to bear the brunt of the flames, Quinlivan saved the lives of his colleagues. During the blaze seven other volunteer firefighters suffered serious burns. For his actions, David was posthumously awarded the Commissioner's Medal of Valour alongside fellow firefighter Michael Young - the highest internal award of the New South Wales Rural Fire Service.\n\nWingello has since recovered and its modern resurgence can be attributed to its tranquility and the idyllic life-style it offers. The hamlet nestles in the midst of pine and eucalypt forests and is approximately 1.5 hours from both Sydney and Canberra. The area has attracted many artists, particularly writers, and is the home of published authors and professional writers who find the environment conducive to prodigious creative output.\n\n2020 Bushfire \nIn January 2020 the town was again affected by a bushfire during the 2019\u201320 Australian bushfire season. Several homes were destroyed.\n\nHeritage listings\nWingello has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n Main Southern railway: Wingello railway station\n\nNotable people \nBill O'Reilly (cricketer)\n\nReferences \n\nTowns of the Southern Highlands (New South Wales)\nWingecarribee Shire", "machine_text": "Wingello is a small village located in the Southern Highlands region of New South Wales, Australia.

It was rare for ancient Athens to permit foreign residents of the city to worship their own gods; the cult of Bendis and the Bendidia is one of a few exceptions, driven by the strategic importance of Thrace to Athens at the beginning of the Peloponnesian War.\n\nThe Bendidia began with a procession to the sanctuary of Bendis.  Worshippers coming from Athens processed from the Prytaneion, while the Thracian worshippers of Bendis in the Piraeus organised a separate procession, possibly organised so that it would join up with the Athenian contingent before they arrived at the sanctuary.  The procession from Athens \u2013 six miles from the sanctuary \u2013 was provided with sponges and basins in which to wash, and garlands; the celebrants then ate lunch in the precinct of the sanctuary.  After dark, there was a horseback relay race, with the riders passing torches.  The horseback race was a Thracian feature of the festival, as such races at Athenian festivals were usually performed on foot, and Thracians were famous for their equestrianism, though it is unknown if similar races were also held in Thrace itself.

On the first day, Saint-Priest's Russians and General Friedrich Wilhelm von Jagow's Prussians easily captured Reims from its French National Guard garrison, capturing or killing more than half of its defenders. On the second day, an overconfident Saint-Priest carelessly deployed his forces west of the city, not grasping that Napoleon was approaching with 20,000 troops. Too late, Saint-Priest realized who he was fighting and tried to organize a retreat. In the battle that followed, the French army struck with crushing force and the Allies were routed with serious losses. During the fighting, Saint-Priest was struck by a howitzer shell and died two weeks later.\n\nBackground\nOn 9\u201310 March 1814, a 100,000-strong Allied army led by Field Marshal Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher defeated Emperor Napoleon's 39,000-man Imperial French army in the Battle of Laon. The French lost 4,000 killed and wounded plus 2,500 men, 45 guns and 130 caissons captured. The Allies admitted only 744 casualties. Another source stated that the Allies sustained 4,000 casualties while inflicting 7,500 on the French. Early on the second day, Bl\u00fccher was so ill with an eye infection that he temporarily handed over command to his chief of staff August Neidhardt von Gneisenau. Though Bl\u00fccher had issued orders to attack the French that day, the new commander cancelled them. Consequently, Napoleon was able to disengage his battered army and withdraw almost unmolested to Soissons. Without Bl\u00fccher's guiding hand, the Allied corps commanders began to clash with one another. Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg tried to resign his corps command and was only persuaded to remain by Bl\u00fccher. \n\nAt dawn on 11 March, Napoleon's army began its retreat to Soissons where it formed for battle at 3:00 pm. Only 1,500 Russians mounted a pursuit and they were easily kept at bay by the French rearguard. The right wing of Marshal Auguste de Marmont, whose corps had been routed at Laon, retreated to Fismes. On 11\u201312 March Napoleon organized a defense at Soissons and issued orders for his eastern garrisons to break out and harass the Allied supply lines going back to the Rhine River. \n\nNot only did the French army suffer heavy casualties at Laon, it also lost between 5,400 and 8,000 men at the Battle of Craonne on 7 March. Napoleon assigned Marshal \u00c9douard Mortier to command 8,000\u20139,000 infantry in the divisions of Joseph Boyer de R\u00e9beval, Henri Fran\u00e7ois Marie Charpentier, Charles-Joseph Christiani, Philibert Jean-Baptiste Curial, Claude Marie Meunier, Paul-Jean-Baptiste Poret de Morvan and 4,000 cavalry in the divisions of Nicolas-Fran\u00e7ois Roussel d'Hurbal and Louis Michel Pac, and a march regiment. One battalion of the Legion of the Vistula, 600 Polish lancers, three cavalry march regiments, two companies of coast guard gunners, two sapper companies and 1,000 conscripts arrived as reinforcements from Paris. A new cavalry unit called the Converged Squadrons Division was formed and assigned to Sigismond Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric de Berckheim. \n\nNapoleon disbanded the two Young Guard corps of Marshals Michel Ney and Claude Perrin Victor and Poret de Morvan's provisional division. Extra officers and non-coms were sent to Paris to recruit while the survivors were consolidated into the divisions of Curial and Charpentier. After reorganization, Mortier's 10,609-strong corps consisted of Christiani's 2,034 men, Curial's 2,796 men, Charpentier's 2,755 men, 2,062 cavalrymen and 962 gunners. The remainder of the army was formed into Marmont's 7,200 soldiers, Louis Friant's 3,600 Old Guards, Boyer de R\u00e9beval's 3,000 men, the 2,400 sabers of the I Cavalry Corps, Berckheim's 1,700 horsemen and Horace Sebastiani's 4,400 guard cavalrymen.\n\nAllies capture Reims\nSaint-Priest, a French \u00e9migr\u00e9, led the Russian 8th Infantry Corps, which was made up of the 11th and 17th Infantry Divisions. Each division consisted of four line infantry and two j\u00e4ger regiments. At the beginning of 1814, the corps numbered 11,900 soldiers and formed part of Louis Alexandre Andrault de Langeron's 43,000-strong army corps. On 31 December 1813, the 8th Corps executed a successful assault crossing of the Rhine River near Koblenz. After this operation the corps advanced to Dinant on the Meuse River. On 15 February, Saint-Priest's corps was ordered to take over the Siege of Mainz. By early March, Saint-Priest had moved west to occupy Ch\u00e2lons-sur-Marne and Vitry-le-Fran\u00e7ois. Fresh from the blockade of Erfurt, Jagow brought his Prussian brigade to join Saint-Priest.\n\nIn 1814, Reims had a population of 30,000 and was one of the most important cities of France. The city was surrounded by a wall and the Vesle River flowed through the city from southeast to northwest. The Soissons suburb was on an island to the southwest, opposite the city. Reims was  north of Ch\u00e2lons-sur-Marne and  east of Soissons. Napoleon was aware that Reims was in grave danger but he could only spare the Honor Guards cavalry division under Jean-Marie Defrance to watch the crossings of the Aisne River. The city's garrison was commanded by Jean Corbineau and was made up of 4,000 National Guards, a handful of line infantry and eight artillery pieces. Another authority asserted that the French garrison numbered only 1,256 infantry and 150 cavalry. These included details from the 15th, 43rd, 50th, 66th and 138th Line Infantry, 1st and 3rd Gardes d'Honneur, 2nd Eclaireurs and Guard artillery. \n\n \n\nSaint-Priest's force included the 8-battalion 11th Division led by Ivan Stepanovich Gurgalov, four battalions from the 17th Division under Igor Maximovich Pillar, two dragoon regiments commanded by Georgi Emmanuel, the 3-regiment 1st Horse Chasseur Division directed by Ivan Davidovich Pandschulishev and at least 12 guns. Attached to the force was Jagow's Prussian brigade which had three battalions each of the 1st Pommeranian (919 men) and 5th Kurm\u00e4rk (810 men) Landwehr Regiments, one battalion each of the 3rd Pommeranian (380 men) and 2nd Neumark (263 men) Landwehr Regiments, elements of the 7th Kurm\u00e4rk (77 sabers) and 1st West Prussian (41 sabers) Landwehr Cavalry Regiments, a battery with eight 6-pound cannons and a battery with six 7-pound howitzers. There were 7,800 Russians and 5,600 Prussians, including two 4-squadron regiments of Landwehr cavalry.\n\nThe three attacking columns assembled at Cormontreuil at 3:00 am on 12 March 1814. Emmanuel's column consisted of the Kiev Dragoons, Riazan Infantry Regiment and 33rd J\u00e4gers plus two Prussian battalions, two cannons and two howitzers. Pillar's column included the rest of the Russian infantry, 50 horsemen, two Prussian battalions and two howitzers. Jagow's column had six Prussian battalions 150 cavalry and 10 artillery pieces. Jagow's column assaulted Reims between the \u00c9pernay and Soissons roads, from the southwest. Covered by the fire of two 12-pound cannons, the Prussians broke into the city at the Paris gate. Pillar's column moved from the southeast along the north bank of the Vesle. The column under Emmanuel attacked from the northeast down the Rethel road, while the Kiev Dragoons and the Chernigov Horse Chasseurs stormed from the northwest down the Laon road. The attack was a complete surprise.   \n\nEmmanuel slowly pushed a Young Guard cadre back to the Place des Arcades. Meanwhile, Pillar's troops forced their way into the city by the Ch\u00e2lons gate and followed the edge of the city wall to get behind the French defenders. The Young Guards tried to fight their way through Pillar's men but were soon forced to surrender. A body of defenders tried to get away north to Berry-au-Bac but they were intercepted by Russian cavalry and over 200 survivors were captured. Some French defenders retreated to the northwest along the north bank of the Vesle. Though pursued by Allied horsemen, they escaped when Defrance's six squadrons of honor guards and hussars arrived in time to cover their withdrawal. Altogether, 2,500 French infantry and 11 guns fell into Allied hands in the city. A second source stated that 100 men of the 1,356-man garrison were killed and most of the remainder captured, including General Jean-Laurent Lacoste-Duvivier.\n\nEmmanuel deployed the Kiev Dragoons at La Neuvillette north of Reims. They clashed inconclusively with Defrance's cavalry for the remainder of the day. Saint-Priest was anxious to quickly establish contact with Bl\u00fccher's army via Berry-au-Bac. The rest of the day was spent rounding up French soldiers trapped in the city. Saint-Priest's Russians camped inside Reims while Jagow's Prussians bivouacked in the villages on the west side of the city. Scouts were sent as far west as Fismes but patrolling was not aggressive. The Russian commander was aware of the Allied victory at Laon and did not expect any trouble. When he heard that Reims had fallen, Gneisenau asserted that the French were not capable of quickly retaking the city.\n\nBattle\n\nApproach march\n\nWhen Napoleon heard that Saint-Priest captured Reims he realized that he might score a cheap victory over the Allies. A success at Reims would cut the link between the army Bl\u00fccher to the north and Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg's Allied army to the south. The war was going badly for Napoleon. Marshal Jacques MacDonald was falling back before Schwarzenberg, Eug\u00e8ne de Beauharnais was in a tight spot in Italy, Marshal Pierre Augereau was losing territory in the south. The political situation also appeared dire. The Allies were negotiating the Treaty of Chaumont in order to more closely bind their alliance against the French emperor and the French people were tired of the war. Napoleon needed a quick victory to restore his reputation. The emperor wrote, \"My intention being to attack Saint-Priest near Reims tomorrow, to defeat him and reoccupy the town\".\n\nNapoleon left Mortier with 8,000 infantry and 4,000 cavalry to hold Soissons. Augustin Daniel Belliard led Mortier's cavalry which included a brigade from Berckheim's division. Mortier was instructed to defend the Aisne on either side of Soissons but not to allow himself to be drawn into a general battle. Napoleon ordered Marmont with the VI Corps and the I Cavalry Corps to march from Fismes toward Reims starting on the morning of 13 March. They would be followed by all the Guard Cavalry, Friant's division, Pierre Fran\u00e7ois Xavier Boyer's brigade and the Legion of the Vistula battalion. The stage was set for the French soldiers to do some epic marching. Friant began his march from Soissons at 2:00 am and arrived before Reims at 4:00 pm, while Marmont set out from Fismes at 6:00 am. Ney's infantry started from Soissons around 8:00 pm and got to Reims before 4:00 pm. Napoleon set out from Soissons with the Guard cavalry service squadrons.\n\n\u00c9tienne Tardif de Pommeroux de Bordesoulle's I Cavalry Corps led Marmont's advance. After obtaining local guides, the column left the main road at Jonchery-sur-Vesle and followed a route through Sapicourt to Rosnay. At Rosnay, they surprised several squadrons of Prussian cavalry which fled in a panic. One battalion of the 3rd Pommeranian Landwehr Regiment was at Rosny while a second battalion was at Muizon on the Vesle. The 5th Kurm\u00e4rk Landwehr had one battalion at Gueux and a second one at Thillois. The battalion in Rosnay fell back fighting to Gueux and finally to Ormes. While defending themselves in the Ormes cemetery, the Prussians were overwhelmed by Pierre Pelleport's infantry brigade; many surrendered while others were cut down by the 10th Hussars and the 1st Gardes d'Honneur from Cyrille Simon Picquet's cavalry brigade. While he was inspecting a camp at Gueux, Jagow was surprised by French cavalry and galloped away on an unsaddled horse. Caught unaware as they cooked supper, many of the Prussians at Muizon and Thillois left their shoes and coats behind in their flight.\n\nSaint-Priest deployed his Allied troops on the west side of Reims in a double line supported by 24 field guns. His right flank rested on the Vesle River, his center on the Tinqueux heights and his left flank at the La Muire ravine. The 1st Pommeranian Landwehr and 12 guns were posted near Bezannes on the left. One battalion of the Neumark Landwehr was at Cormontreuil while a second battalion guarded the bridge at Sillery to the southeast of Reims. The Prussian cavalry deployed on the far left while Russian cavalry held the far right flank. Saint-Priest established an artillery battery on the Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve plateau which was supported by the Riazan Infantry, the 1st and 33rd Jagers and the Kharkov and Kiev Dragoons. This force was placed under the direction of Adam Ivanovich Bistrom. Saint-Priest was still convinced that the French activity was a simple reconnaissance.\n\nAssault\n\nBordesoulle's horsemen began pressing back Bistrom's troops. In the early afternoon, Napoleon reached the battlefield. Since the infantry under Ney and Friant had not yet arrived, the French emperor instructed Bordesoulle and Defrance to withdraw a little and ordered the cannons to cease fire. The lack of serious action satisfied Saint-Priest that he had nothing to worry about. The Russian commander gave no orders to move the corps wagon train which was parked in Reims. He believed his defenses were manned in sufficient strength. By 4:00 pm Ney and Friant were on hand. With evening only two hours away, Napoleon ordered an immediate attack. \n\nDefrance's cavalry and \u00c9tienne Pierre Sylvestre Ricard's infantry division led the assault. The Guard cavalry divisions of R\u00e9mi Joseph Isidore Exelmans and Pierre David de Colbert-Chabanais, under the direction of Sebastiani, advanced on Ricard's flanks. Farther south, Bordesoulle's divisions moved toward Bezannes with Christophe Antoine Merlin's division leading. Bordesoulle's thrust was designed to prevent the Prussians from retreating to the southeast via Sillery. The French artillery took position at Croix-Saint-Pierre to the north of the Soissons road while Friant and Pierre Boyer were held in reserve. Ricard's division crossed the La Muire ravine and forced its way onto the Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve heights, splitting the center of the Allied line and forcing the Russians back toward Reims. \n\nThe violence of the assault convinced Saint-Priest that he was facing Napoleon himself. He hastily ordered his second line to retreat through Reims in the direction of Laon. The Russian commander directed his wagon train to go south to Ch\u00e2lons and asked Bistrom to cover the withdrawal. The retrograde movement of the Prussians through the Reims suburb became confused and Jagow was unable to unsnarl it. When Saint-Priest and his staff rode to a place between the Soissons road and Tinqueux village, they drew fire from the French artillery on the Croix-Saint-Pierre heights. Saint-Priest was hit in the shoulder by a howitzer shell and thrown senseless from his horse. A second source stated that the projectile was a solid shot. The next ranking officer, Pandschulishev was injured earlier in the day. Unable to mount a horse, he stayed behind in Reims. After witnessing Saint-Priest being struck down, Emmanuel should have assumed command of the troops. Instead, he \"lost his head\" and rode back into Reims to ask Pandschulishev what he ought to do. The Allied command structure went to pieces. \n\nThe Allied withdrawal soon degenerated into a scramble to safety as cannons were left behind and some foot soldiers jettisoned equipment in order to get away more rapidly. Philippe Paul, comte de S\u00e9gur led the 3rd Gardes d'Honneur, some cuirassiers and the 14th Young Guard Battery in a charge that forced some Russian dragoons into the Vesle. However, the Riazan Regiment, bearing the unconscious body of Saint-Priest, maintained its discipline. Pandschulishev ordered six battalions to hold the city walls. Caught between Russians manning the Reims defenses and the withdrawing Riazan Regiment, S\u00e9gur's horsemen were trapped and shot down by the score. Next, Ricard's infantry tried to storm the Soissons gate but were driven back by intense musketry. Marmont ordered a battalion into the houses near the walls and instructed the soldiers to pick off the defenders.\n\nSkirmishing went on until 11:00 pm when artillery was wheeled into position to fire on the gate. Though a number of gunners were shot down by the Russian defenders, 16 cannons of the Guard artillery blew open the gate in a furious barrage. Cuirassiers charged into Reims and soon cleared the streets of the Allies. Napoleon and his staff entered Reims at midnight. Another source stated that Napoleon's entrance was an hour later and added that the townspeople turned out to welcome him. Meanwhile, utilizing a bridging train, Exelmans' division and some Polish horsemen crossed the Vesle and headed for the road to Berry-au-Bac. They waded into the retreating column of Jagow and Emmanuel, turning it into a fleeing mob. When Jagow arrived at Berry-au-Bac early on 14 March he reported having only two intact battalions.\n\nResults\n\nNapoleon claimed in his battle report that the gunner who fatally wounded Saint-Priest was the same one who killed Jean Victor Marie Moreau at the Battle of Dresden. Historian Digby Smith wrote that French casualties in the recapture of Reims were about 900. The Russians lost 1,400 men and 12 guns, while the Prussians suffered casualties of 1,300 men and 10 guns. George Nafziger stated that the French suffered 700\u2013800 casualties including a badly-wounded S\u00e9gur. Nafziger listed Allied losses as 700\u2013800 dead, 1,500\u20131,600 wounded and 2,500\u20133,500 captured, along with 11\u201314 guns and 100 caissons or wagons. The Prussians admitted losses of 1,300 infantry, 85 cavalry, six howitzers and four cannons. David G. Chandler asserted that the French inflicted 6,000 casualties on the Allies while sustaining losses of 700. While the French army brought 20,000 to 25,000 troops onto the battlefield, no more than 10,000 were actually employed against the 14,500 Allies. \n\nNapoleon spent three days at Reims following his victory. With Bl\u00fccher still recovering from sickness, Gneisenau did not trouble the French during that time. The French emperor sent Ney to seize Ch\u00e2lons-sur-Marne, which was done without opposition. Ney was joined by Jan Willem Janssens who gathered 3,000 men from the Ardennes garrisons. Meanwhile, Schwarzenberg's army advanced perilously close to Paris. Napoleon's problem was to lure the Allied army away from Paris. He decided to leave Marmont and Mortier with 21,000 soldiers to watch Bl\u00fccher and move south toward Arcis-sur-Aube to threaten Schwarzenberg's supply line. The Battle of Arcis-sur-Aube was fought on 20\u201321 March 1814.\n\nNapoleon had achieved a remarkable victory with troops whose morale had suffered due to heavy casualties at Craonne and the defeat at Laon. According to the historian F.W.O. Maycock, success at Reims was, \"surely one of the greatest triumphs of [Napoleon's] remarkable career, and speaks volumes for his powers as a leader of men\". Napoleon once again interposed between the forces of Bl\u00fccher and Schwarzenberg, putting him in position to move on the latter's line of communications.\n\nNotes\nFootnotes\n\nCitations\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n NapoleonGames\n Live d'Or\n War and Champagne\n\n1814 in France\nBattles of the Napoleonic Wars\nBattles of the War of the Sixth Coalition\nReims 1814\nBattles involving France\nBattles involving Prussia\nBattles involving Russia\nConflicts in 1814\nMarch 1814 events", "machine_text": "The Battle of Reims was a significant battle fought during the War of the Sixth Coalition on March 13, 1814. It was fought between the allied armies of Russia, Prussia, Austria and Sweden against the French army led by Napoleon Bonaparte. The outcome of the battle ultimately led to the defeat of the French army and marked the beginning of the end of Napoleon's reign. The battle began when the allied forces launched an offensive on the fortified city of Reims. They encountered fierce resistance from the French army stationed there. The fighting was intense, with both sides suffering heavy casualties. The allies eventually breached the walls of the city and captured it, forcing the French army to retreat. Napoleon was forced to abandon his plan of launching a counteroffensive against the allied forces and instead retreated towards Paris. The Battle of Reims was significant because it exposed the weakened state of the French army and demonstrated the superior military strength of the allied forces. The battle is also notable for the role played by a young Prussian officer named Carl von Clausewitz. He was instrumental in planning the allied offensive and played a crucial role in the victory at Reims. His military strategies and tactics would later influence the development of modern military theory. Although the Battle of Reims was a decisive victory for the allied forces, the war was far from over. It would take several more months of fighting before Napoleon was finally defeated and exiled to the island of Elba. However, the battle at Reims marked a significant turning point in the conflict and paved the way for the final defeat of Napoleon's empire.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 3355204}

A regular polygon exists in 2 real dimensions, , while a complex polygon exists in two complex dimensions, , which can be given real representations in 4 dimensions, , which then must be projected down to 2 or 3 real dimensions to be visualized. A complex polygon is generalized as a complex polytope in .\n\nA complex polygon may be understood as a collection of complex points, lines, planes, and so on, where every point is the junction of multiple lines, every line of multiple planes, and so on.\n\nThe regular complex polygons have been completely characterized, and can be described using a symbolic notation developed by Coxeter.\n\nRegular complex polygons\nWhile 1-polytopes can have unlimited p, finite regular complex polygons, excluding the double prism polygons p{4}2, are limited to 5-edge (pentagonal edges) elements, and infinite regular aperiogons also include 6-edge (hexagonal edges) elements.\n\nNotations\n\nShephard's modified Schl\u00e4fli notation\n\nShephard originally devised a modified form of Schl\u00e4fli's notation for regular polytopes. For a polygon bounded by p1-edges, with a p2-set as vertex figure and overall symmetry group of order g, we denote the polygon as p1(g)p2.\n\nThe number of vertices V is then g/p2 and the number of edges E is g/p1.\n\nThe complex polygon illustrated above has eight square edges (p1=4) and sixteen vertices (p2=2). From this we can work out that g = 32, giving the modified Schl\u00e4fli symbol 4(32)2.\n\nCoxeter's revised modified Schl\u00e4fli notation\n\nA more modern notation p1{q}p2 is due to Coxeter, and is based on group theory. As a symmetry group, its symbol is p1[q]p2.\n\nThe symmetry group p1[q]p2 is represented by 2 generators R1, R2, where: R1p1 = R2p2 = I. If q is even, (R2R1)q/2 = (R1R2)q/2. If q is odd, (R2R1)(q\u22121)/2R2 = (R1R2)(q\u22121)/2R1. When q is odd, p1=p2.\n\nFor 4[4]2 has R14 = R22 = I, (R2R1)2 = (R1R2)2.\n\nFor 3[5]3 has R13 = R23 = I, (R2R1)2R2 = (R1R2)2R1.\n\nCoxeter\u2013Dynkin diagrams\n\nCoxeter also generalised the use of Coxeter\u2013Dynkin diagrams to complex polytopes, for example the complex polygon p{q}r is represented by  and the equivalent symmetry group, p[q]r, is a ringless diagram . The nodes p and r represent mirrors producing p and r images in the plane. Unlabeled nodes in a diagram have implicit 2 labels. For example, a real regular polygon is 2{q}2 or {q} or .\n\nOne limitation, nodes connected by odd branch orders must have identical node orders.

So  and  are ordinary, while  is starry.\n\n12 Irreducible Shephard groups\n\nCoxeter enumerated this list of regular complex polygons in . A regular complex polygon, p{q}r or , has p-edges, and r-gonal vertex figures. p{q}r is a finite polytope if (p\u00a0+\u00a0r)q\u00a0>\u00a0pr(q\u00a0\u2212\u00a02).\n\nIts symmetry is written as p[q]r, called a Shephard group, analogous to a Coxeter group, while also allowing unitary reflections.\n\nFor nonstarry groups, the order of the group p[q]r can be computed as .\n\nThe Coxeter number for p[q]r is  , so the group order can also be computed as . A regular complex polygon can be drawn in orthogonal projection with h-gonal symmetry.\n\nThe rank 2 solutions that generate complex polygons are: \n\nExcluded solutions with odd q and unequal p and r are: 6[3]2, 6[3]3, 9[3]3, 12[3]3, ..., 5[5]2, 6[5]2, 8[5]2, 9[5]2, 4[7]2, 9[5]2, 3[9]2, and 3[11]2.\n\nOther whole q with unequal p and r, create starry groups with overlapping fundamental domains: , , , , , and .\n\nThe dual polygon of p{q}r is r{q}p. A polygon of the form p{q}p is self-dual. Groups of the form p[2q]2 have a half symmetry p[q]p, so a regular polygon  is the same as quasiregular . As well, regular polygon with the same node orders, , have an alternated construction , allowing adjacent edges to be two different colors.\n\nThe group order, g, is used to compute the total number of vertices and edges. It will have g/r vertices, and g/p edges. When p=r, the number of vertices and edges are equal. This condition is required when q is odd.\n\nMatrix generators \nThe group p[q]r, , can be represented by two matrices:\n\nWith\n \n\nExamples\n\nEnumeration of regular complex polygons \nCoxeter enumerated the complex polygons in Table III of Regular Complex Polytopes.\n\nVisualizations of regular complex polygons\n\n2D graphs\nPolygons of the form p{2r}q can be visualized by q color sets of p-edge. Each p-edge is seen as a regular polygon, while there are no faces.\n\nComplex polygons 2{r}q\n\nPolygons of the form 2{4}q are called generalized orthoplexes. They share vertices with the 4D q-q duopyramids, vertices connected by 2-edges. \n\nComplex polygons p{4}2\n\nPolygons of the form p{4}2 are called generalized hypercubes (squares for polygons). They share vertices with the 4D p-p duoprisms, vertices connected by p-edges. Vertices are drawn in green, and p-edges are drawn in alternate colors, red and blue. The perspective is distorted slightly for odd dimensions to move overlapping vertices from the center.\n\nComplex polygons p{r}2\n\nComplex polygons, p{r}p\n\nPolygons of the form p{r}p have equal number of vertices and edges.

A regular complex polygon can be defined as a complex polygon where all vertices have the same modulus. A regular complex polygon can be described by its center, the radius of its circumcircle, and the number of its sides. For a regular complex polygon with n sides, the vertices are located at the roots of unity, that is, the n-th roots of unity. The radius of the circumcircle is equal to the modulus of the vertices. The regular complex polygon is an important concept in mathematics as it has numerous applications in geometry, number theory, and even physics. In geometry, the properties of regular polygons in the complex plane are studied extensively. For example, the area of a regular complex polygon can be calculated using the formula A = R2n sin(2\u03c0/n), where A is the area, R is the radius of the circumcircle, and n is the number of sides. The regular complex polygon also has applications in number theory, particularly with regards to Fermat's Last Theorem. This theorem states that there are no non-zero integers a, b, c, and n such that an + bn = cn, for any integer value of n greater than two. However, regular complex polygons can be used to formulate a counterexample to this theorem in the case where n is a prime number. In physics, regular complex polygons are used in the study of crystallography, where they play a crucial role in determining the symmetry properties of crystals. By treating atoms as points in the complex plane, regular complex polygons can be used to describe the symmetry transformations of crystal lattices. In conclusion, the regular complex polygon is a fundamental concept in mathematics with numerous applications across a variety of fields. Its unique properties and symmetry make it a valuable tool for understanding and analyzing complex systems.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 50885422}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Wang Yi (librarian)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Wang Yi (; c. CE 89\u2013158), courtesy name Shushi (), was a Chinese poet during the Eastern Han dynasty who was employed in the Imperial Library by the Later Han  emperor Shun Di (reigned CE 125 \u2013 144). Wang Yi is known for his work on the poetry anthology Chu Ci. Although with varying reliability, his commentaries on this work are a main source of information regarding some of its often obscure textual references.\n\nBiography\nWang Yi was born in the former territory of the State of Chu, in what is now Yicheng, Hubei. (Hawkes, 2011 [1985]: 28 and 307) Chu had existed as an independent political entity for many centuries, and for much of that time as one of the major regional powers, until its defeat in BCE 223, by Qin, some four centuries before the birth of Wang Yi. The Qin political unification of China by military conquest was followed by a deliberate policy of enforcing cultural uniformity throughout the new empire. Still, his associations with the former Chu region gave Wang an advantage in terms of explaining some of the dialectic words or the customs of Chu. (Hawkes, 2011 [1985]: 28)\n\nFamily\nWang Yi had a son, Wang Yanshou, a poet. One of Yanshou's poems, \"The Nightmare\", was translated by Arthur Waley, in Chinese Poems.\n\nWorks\nWang Yi's main known works are his introductory commentaries on the Chu Ci and its individual works as well as his original poetry written in the Chu Ci style. (Hawkes, 2011 [1985]: 28) Although Wang Yi is sometimes attributed as selecting and compiling the Chu Ci in its present form, he himself specifically denies this, attributing the compilation instead to Liu Xiang, except for his own original contributions. (Hawkes, 2011 [1985]: 30) (And, it turns out, this does not include the commentaries on Wang's own Chu Ci imitations. (Hawkes, 2011 [1985]: 28)) \nAlso, the order in which the Chu Ci  material is presented in modern editions dates from the tenth or eleventh centuries at the earliest, when Wang Yi's edition was rearranged. (Hawkes, 2011 [1985]: 30)\n\nWang Yi wrote nine poems in the Chu Ci style, which he contributed as part of his Chu Ci anthology, adding them on to the book's end, as the custom was in such a case. (Hawkes, 2011 [1985]: 31) These poems appear under the collective title of Nine Longings (Jiu si), in the seventeenth and final major section (juan) of the Chu Ci anthology. In terms of quality, these works by Wang Yi have nowhere near the fame and acclaim of \"On Encountering Trouble\" (Li Sao), or some of the other poems: David Hawkes describes Wang's \"Nine Longings\" poems as \"not very inspired verses\". (Hawkes, 2011 [1985]: 28)\n\nWang Yi is also known for writing in the fu style which was typically popular during the Han Dynasty, one example being his \"Fu on the Lychee\" ().\n\nSee also\nChu ci\nFu (poetry)\nList of Chuci contents\nLiu An\nLiu Xiang (scholar)\nNine Longings\nSong Yu\nQu Yuan\nWang Bao\n\nReferences\nFootnotes\n\nWorks cited\nDavid Hawkes, translator and introduction (2011 [1985]).

Although it originally contained all five books of the Pentateuch, it is now missing the whole of Deuteronomy as well as sections of the other five books.\n\nIt has 142 folios and 19 miniatures, and measures 372mm by 321mm. It is thought to have originally included as many as 68 full page miniatures. A full page table containing the Latin names of the books and Latin transliterations of the Hebrew names serves as a front piece to Genesis. The table is enclosed within a curtained arch. Some of the full page miniatures, such as that containing the miniature of Noah's Ark (folio 9r), contain a single scene. Other full page miniatures, such as that telling the story of Cain and Abel, contain many scenes which are placed in a register, with each scene having a different color background.\n\nThe origin of this manuscript is uncertain. Although it has been described by some scholars as Spanish, it may have come from North Africa, Syria or Italy.\n\nThe miniatures were used as the source of a later cycle of wall-paintings at the church of St Julian in Tours. The manuscript was at the Library of Tours before being stolen in 1842 by Guglielmo Libri Carucci dalla Sommaja and sold to Bertram Ashburnham, 4th Earl of Ashburnham in 1847. Since 1888, it has been housed at the National Library of France in Paris after its restitution by the heirs of Lord Ashburnham.\n\nReferences\n Calkins, Robert G.

It was created in the 6th century in either Italy or North Africa and is currently housed in the British Library in London. The manuscript contains 102 intricately illuminated pages, with golden capitals and beautiful calligraphy. The illustrations depict various biblical scenes and characters, including Moses, Aaron, and the Pharaohs of Egypt. The illuminations are done in a Byzantine style, with bright colors and intricate patterns. The Ashburnham Pentateuch has a fascinating history. It is named after its former owner, the Earl of Ashburnham, who purchased it from a French monastery in the 19th century. However, its origins are still somewhat of a mystery. The manuscript is written in Greek, which suggests an Eastern Mediterranean origin. It is possible that it was created in Alexandria, one of the most important centers of Greek learning in the ancient world. The manuscript has also had a tumultuous history, including damage by fire and theft. In 1731, a fire broke out in the library of the King\u2019s Palace in Lisbon, Portugal, where the manuscript was being kept. The manuscript was badly damaged, and several pages were lost. It was later discovered that the fire was set by a thief who tried to steal the manuscript. Despite its age and the damage it has suffered, the Ashburnham Pentateuch remains one of the most important and well-known illuminated manuscripts in the world.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Harriet Ward\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Harriet Ward n\u00e9e Tidy (1808 \u2013 1873), was a British writer whose work is sometimes thought of as South African literature. She lived in the Cape Colony for a few years and her best-known books are set there: the non-fiction Five Years in Kaffirland and the fictional Jasper Lyle, the first English novel set entirely in South Africa. She also wrote articles for a military audience, unusually for a woman of that era. Her writing has stimulated discussion about whether or not she agreed fully with British colonial attitudes.\n\nPersonal life \nShe was born at Thorp, Norfolk in 1808 to Colonel and Mrs Francis Skelly Tidy, n\u00e9e Miss Pinder, daughter of the Chief Justice of Barbados. After school in France and London she married John Ward in 1831. He was a military officer from Waterford, Ireland and his wife accompanied him on various postings. They had one daughter, Isabel. The family lived together on St Helena in the late 1830s. In 1842 they travelled from Cork to the eastern frontier of the Cape and spent five years in the British colony there, at Fort Peddie and Grahamstown, in the so-called \"Ceded Territory\". Ward returned to Britain in 1848. This is when she started to publish full-length books, building on previous articles and short stories. The Wards may have lived in Dover before moving to Boulogne-sur-Mer in about 1851, but biographical details are scant. She died in 1873.\n\nWriting\n\nHer first published writing was in The United Service Journal and Naval and Military Magazine in the early 1840s. She began with articles about her father and later contributed reports about war and life in \"Kaffirland\", a British name for an area of the Cape Colony stretching from Kaffraria to Albany. (The name was based on the word Kaffir which the British used to describe the indigenous people of that region.) Ward developed an authoritative voice and was one of the first women whose work was treated as credible war reporting. Some of the writing she did in 1846 and 1847 formed the basis for the book which came out soon after her arrival in England in 1848: Five years in Kaffirland: with sketches of the late war in that country to the conclusion of peace: written on the spot.\n\nThis book was well-received in a period of public interest in the \"Kaffir War\" or War of the Axe. and ran to three editions. In the same year Ward's first novel, Helen Charteris, was also published but a reviewer complained that the main romance was \"encumbered\" by sub-plots.  Three years later her novel Jasper Lyle: a tale of Kafirland (sic) was more successful and was described in the Morning Post as \"truthful and popular\" with a \"fidelity and vivacity\" in its descriptions of \"Kaffir life and scenery\", \"giving it at the present moment an especial interest\". This too ran to three editions, plus two more in the 1870s after Ward's death and just before the Zulu War, when UK interest in South Africa was high.\n\nCritics' interpretations of Ward's overall opinions vary. Some see her as \"stridently propagandist\" for British imperialism, particularly in her non-fiction writing about colonial South Africa, while others find more complex attitudes, for instance when the eponymous heroine of Helen Charteris is friendly with a Creole girl. Some believe Ward either felt unable to express unconventional views openly or held inconsistent attitudes without being particularly conscious of it. It has also been suggested she was offering a \"veiled critique\" or even deliberately expressing \"anti-colonial dissidence\". One critic thinks she wrote at first with \"full complicity in the prejudices of the frontier\" but later revealed a \"startling mismatch\" with this in her novels.\n\nSelect bibliography\n\nBooks available online \n\n  Five years in Kaffirland: with sketches of the late war in that country, to the conclusion of peace.

Arabic, Telugu, Kannada, Tamil, Old Hungarian (Hungarian Runic), Hebrew, Iberian, Georgian, and Hangul are unicase writing systems, while (modern) Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, and Armenian are bicameral, as they have two cases for each letter, e.g., B/b, \u0392/\u03b2, \u0411/\u0431, \u0532/\u0562. Individual characters can also be called unicameral if they are used as letters with a generally bicameral alphabet but have only one form for both cases; for example, \u02bbokina (), used in Polynesian languages, and glottal stop (\u0294) as used in Nuu-chah-nuulth.\n\nMost alphabets today with two cases were once unicase, Latin, used to be written with a unicase alphabet in imperial Roman times; it was only later that scribes developed new sets of symbols for running text, which became the lower case of the Latin alphabet, while the letterforms of Ancient Rome came to be called capitals or upper case.\n\nA unicase version of the Latin alphabet was proposed by Michael Mann and David Dalby in 1982 as a variation of the Niamey African Reference Alphabet. This version has apparently never been actively used. Another example of unicase Latin alphabet is the Initial Teaching Alphabet. Occasionally some fonts use unicase designs to create an unusual effect; this was particularly popular in the 1960s.\n\nThe International Phonetic Alphabet only uses lowercase Latin (and Greek) letters and some scaled upper-case letters (small caps), effectively making it a unicase alphabet, although it is not used for ordinary writing of any language.\n\nLatin alphabets in modern times that are unicase include Saanich (uppercase except for the suffix -s) in Canada, and palawa kani (lowercase) of Tasmania in Australia.\n\nSee also\nAlphabet 26\nLetter case\n\nReferences\n\nGeorgian Nuskhuri, Unicode 4.1.0, \n\nWriting systems\nOrthography\nTypography", "machine_text": "Unicase is a type of font that features only uppercase (capital) letters, without separate lowercase versions. It is used in graphic design and advertising and can impart a bold and distinctive look to text. Unicase fonts can be standalone designs or part of larger typefaces that include both uppercase and lowercase letters. Unicase fonts have a long history in typography, with some early examples dating back to the 17th century. They were often used for title pages and other display text, and were sometimes combined with ornate flourishes and embellishments. In the 20th century, unicase fonts became more streamlined and modern, with minimalist designs that emphasized clear shapes and proportions. One appeal of unicase fonts is their ability to create a sophisticated and unified look, since all letters are of the same size and weight. This can be particularly useful in branding and advertising, where a clear and memorable image is important. The boldness and clarity of unicase fonts also make them suitable for posters, packaging, and other design applications where text needs to stand out. Despite their advantages, unicase fonts also have some limitations. For one thing, they can be more difficult to read than traditional fonts, since the absence of lowercase letters and descenders can make the text appear more uniform and monotonous. Unicase fonts may also be less versatile than normal fonts, since they are not as well-suited to body text or other situations where clarity and legibility are paramount. Overall, unicase fonts remain a popular and distinctive choice in graphic design and typography.

Nintendo's first-party accessories are mainly transformative system expansions: the 64DD Internet multimedia platform, with a floppy drive, video capture and editor, game building setup, web browser, and online service; the controller plus its own expansions for storage and rumble feedback; and the RAM-boosting Expansion Pak for big improvements in graphics and gameplay. Third-party accessories include the essential game developer tools built by SGI and SN Systems on Nintendo's behalf, an unlicensed SharkWire online service, and unlicensed cheaper counterparts to first-party items. The Nintendo 64 video game console had a market lifespan from 1996 to 2002.\n\nFirst-party\nFirst-party Nintendo 64 accessories have a product code prefixed with NUS, short for \"Nintendo Ultra Sixty-four\".\n\nController\n\nThe Nintendo 64 controller (NUS-005) is an \"m\"-shaped controller with 10 buttons (A, B, C-Up, C-Down, C-Left, C-Right, L, R, Z, and Start), one analog stick in the center, a digital directional pad on the left side, and an extension port on the back for many of the system's accessories. Initially available in the seven colors of gray, yellow, green, red, blue, purple, and black, and it was later released in translucent versions of those colors except gray.\n\nController Pak\n\nThe  (NUS-004) is the console's memory card, comparable to those seen in the PlayStation and other CD-ROM-based video game consoles. Certain games allow saving of game files to the Controller Pak, which plugs into the back of the Nintendo 64 controller (as do the Rumble and Transfer Paks). The Controller Pak was marketed as a way to exchange data with other Nintendo 64 owners, since information saved on the game cartridge can not be transferred between cartridges.\n\nIt is plugged into the controller and allows the player to save game progress and configuration. The original models from Nintendo offered 256 kilobits (32KB) battery backed SRAM, split into 123 pages with a limitation of 16 save files, but third-party models have much more, often in the form of 4 selectable memory banks of 256kbits. The number of pages that a game occupies varies, sometimes using the entire card. It is powered by a common CR2032 battery.\n\nUpon launch, the Controller Pak was initially useful, and even necessary for earlier Nintendo 64 games. Over time, the Controller Pak lost popularity to the convenience of a battery backed SRAM or EEPROM found in some cartridges. Because the Nintendo 64 uses a Game Pak cartridge format that allows saving data on the cartridge itself, few first-party and second-party games use the Controller Pak. The vast majority are from third-party developers. This is most likely due to the increased production and retail costs which would have been caused by including self-contained data on the cartridge. Some games use it to save optional data that is too large for the cartridge, such as Mario Kart 64, which uses 121 of the total 123 pages for storing ghost data, or International Superstar Soccer 64, which uses up the entire cartridge's space for its save data. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater uses 11 pages. Quest 64 and Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon use the Controller Pak exclusively for saved data. The Japan-only game Animal Forest uses the Controller Pak to travel to other towns.\n\nFollowing the 1996 Christmas Shopping Season, Next Generation reported \"impressive sales of the memory pack cartridges despite the lack of available games to take advantage of the $19.99 units\".\n\nJumper Pak \n\nThe Jumper Pak (NUS-008) is a filler that plugs into the console's memory expansion port. It serves no functional purpose other than to terminate the Rambus bus in the absence of the Expansion Pak. This is functionally equivalent to a continuity RIMM in a Rambus motherboard filling the unused RIMM sockets until the user upgrades. Nintendo 64 consoles were shipped with the Jumper Pak included and already installed. Jumper Paks were not sold individually in stores and could only be ordered through Nintendo's online store. The system requires the Jumper Pak when the Expansion Pak is not present or else there will be no picture on the TV screen.\n\nExpansion Pak\n\nThe  (NUS-007) consists of 4\u00a0MB (megabytes) of random access memory (RAM)\u2014which is RDRAM, the same type of memory used inside the console itself\u2014increasing the Nintendo 64 console's RAM from 4\u00a0MB to 8\u00a0MB of contiguous main memory. It is installed in a port on top of the console and replaces the pre-installed Jumper Pak, which is simply a Rambus terminator. Originally designed to accompany the 64DD disk drive expansion peripheral for its larger multimedia workstation applications, the Expansion Pak was launched separately in Q4 1998 and then bundled with the 64DD's delayed December 1999 Japan launch package. The Expansion Pak was bundled with Donkey Kong 64, and in Japan, the Expansion Pak additionally came bundled with The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask and Perfect Dark, though the games have been also available separately in other regions.\n\nIt was bundled with an \"ejector tool\" (NUS-012) meant for removing the original Jumper Pak.\n\nGame developers found ways to take advantage of the increased memory, including greater visual appeal. The Expansion Pak is required in order to run both Donkey Kong 64 and The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask. A third game, Perfect Dark, blocks access to content, including the single-player campaign, when no Expansion Pak is present, with the back cover of the game's packaging stating that \"approximately 35%\" of the game is available in that case. It is also required for all 64DD software. In StarCraft 64, it is needed to unlock levels from the Brood War add-on from the PC version of the game. The Nintendo 64 all-remade version of Quake II features higher color depth and better performance, but not a higher resolution when using the Expansion Pak. Finally, in the vast majority of games with support, such as Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness and Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine, the expansion pak is merely used as additional frame buffer memory to enable various high-resolution (usually interlaced) mode options, at the downside of poorer performance, in some cases dramatically so. This use of the Expansion Pak can be attributed to ease of implementation and games that mainly targeted the stock N64 configuration; additional RDRAM cannot be easily used to circumvent other bottlenecks of the console, such as the small texture cache. Also, the  of Space Station Silicon Valley may crash in certain places if the Expansion Pak is present.\n\nIGN celebrated the Nintendo 64 industry's methods in launching and supporting the Expansion Pak for making a high-impact accessory with \"immediate and noticeable\", though mostly optional, effects.\n\nRumble Pak\n\nThe  (NUS-013) provides haptic feedback to the player by way of vibration. It is powered by two AAA batteries and connects to the controller's expansion port. It was released in 1997 for the new game Star Fox 64, with which it was originally bundled.\n\nTransfer Pak\n\nThe Transfer Pak (NUS-019) plugs into the controller to transfer data between supported Nintendo 64 games and Game Boy or Game Boy Color games. It has a Game Boy Color slot and a part that fits onto the expansion port of the N64 controller. It was included with the game Pok\u00e9mon Stadium.\n\nIn Japan it is called \"64GB\" as Shigeru Miyamoto described at Nintendo's Space World 1997 trade show. It was a key feature of the infamous creature raising game prototype that was never released, Cabbage.\n\nPok\u00e9mon Stadium and Pok\u00e9mon Stadium 2 are games that rely heavily on the Transfer Pak, as the games' main feature is importing Pok\u00e9mon teams from the Game Boy games. Pok\u00e9mon Stadium also includes a \"GB Tower\" mode for playing Pok\u00e9mon Red, Blue, and Yellow directly on the Nintendo 64 via a built-in Game Boy emulator.\n\nThe Japanese version of the Game Boy Camera can be connected to the Mario Artist series. Mario Golf and Mario Tennis allow players to transfer their created characters from the Game Boy Color versions to the Nintendo 64 versions via the Transfer Pak. Rare's Perfect Dark was initially going to be compatible with the Transfer Pak in order to use pictures taken with the Game Boy Camera to create characters with real-life faces, but this function was removed from development after the attacks at Columbine High School and a wave of anti-violent video game sentiment; the Transfer Pak is usable only in combination with the Game Boy Color version of Perfect Dark for unlocking bonuses.\n\nWide-Boy64\n\nDeveloped by Intelligent Systems, the Wide-Boy64 is a series of adapters similar to the Super Game Boy that was able to play Game Boy games. The device was never sold in retail to general consumers and was only provided to developers and the gaming press. Two major versions of Wide-Boy64 were released: the CGB, which could play Game Boy and Game Boy Color games, and the updated AGB, which could also play Game Boy Advance game paks. It also allowed the gaming press to capture screen shots more easily. Like the Super Game Boy and Game Boy Player, the game screen is surrounded by a template mimicking the appearance of the portable system. This device was used for final matches at the Pok\u00e9mon League Summer Training Tour '99. Developers and magazines could purchase one directly from Nintendo at a cost of $1400 apiece. The Canadian children's game show Video & Arcade Top 10 used Wide-Boy64 adapters so contestants could play Game Boy titles on some later episodes.\n\nS-Video Cable\nThe S-Video cable provides a better quality picture than composite RCA cables via the MultiAV port. The NTSC cable is identical to and compatible with earlier SNES (NTSC/PAL) and later GameCube (NTSC-only) S-Video cables. The first-party NTSC Nintendo 64 S-Video cable sold by Nintendo, however, was not produced in PAL regions. The PAL Nintendo 64 does natively output S-Video (Luma/Chroma), but require a different cable to NTSC Nintendo 64 due to a design difference in most or all PAL motherboard revisions. Nintendo never released an official S-Video cable for the PAL console. Using an NTSC S-Video cable on a PAL console will usually produce over-bright, garish colors; or it may not produce any video image at all.\n\nThird-party S-Video cables for both the NTSC and PAL consoles were produced, though it is important to note that many cheaper S-Video cables do not deliver a true S-Video signal, merely passing the composite video signal (the yellow plug of the standard red/white/yellow AV cables) through the S-Video plug.\n\n64DD\n\nThe 64DD (NUS-010) is a  floppy drive with real-time clock, font and audio library in ROM, and a bundle of other accessories and custom games. The peripheral was initially announced in 1995, planned for release in 1997, and repeatedly delayed until its release in December 1999.  It was launched alongside a now defunct online service called Randnet. With nine games released, it was a commercial failure and was consequently never released outside Japan.\n\nMouse\n\nThe mouse (NUS-017) was developed for the 64DD's GUI-based games and applications, such the Mario Artist suite, SimCity 64, and the web browser for Nintendo's defunct online service Randnet. It was manufactured by Mitsumi and bundled with the 64DD's launch game, Mario Artist: Paint Studio. It works with the Game Pak\n\nVRU\n\nThe VRU or Voice Recognition Unit (NUS-020, NUS-021, NUS-022, and NUS-025) is compatible with only two games: Hey You, Pikachu! and Densha de Go! 64. Hey You, Pikachu! is packaged with the VRU and requires it, but Densha de Go! 64 does not and is sold separately. The VRU consists of a ballast (NUS-020) connected to controller port 4 of the system, a microphone (NUS-021), a yellow foam cover for the microphone, and a clip for clipping the microphone to the controller (NUS-025, bundled with Hey You, Pikachu!) or a plastic neck holder for hands free usage (NUS-022, bundled with Densha de Go! 64). The VRU is calibrated for best recognition of a high-pitched voice, such as a child's voice. As a result, the voices of adults and teenagers are less likely be recognized properly by the VRU.\n\nVRUs are region dependent, and a USA region VRU cannot be used with Japanese games and vice versa (foreign region VRUs are not detected by the games). No VRU compatible game was launched in the EUR region (PAL, Europe), so there is no EUR-region VRU. A similar device was also released for the Wii called the Wii Speak.\n\nCleaning Kit\nThe cleaning kit (NUS-014, NUS-015, and NUS-016) contains materials to clean the connectors of the Control Deck, controllers, Game Paks, Rumble Paks, and Controller Paks.\n\nRF Switch and RF Modulator\n\nThe RF Switch and RF Modulator (NUS-009 and NUS-003) allow the Nintendo 64 and model 2 SNES (redesigned after the launch of the Nintendo 64) to hook up to the television through RF. It was primarily intended for customers with older televisions that lack AV cable support. Since the Nintendo 64 and model 2 SNES lack built-in RF compatibility, the modulator acts as a special adapter that plugs into the Nintendo 64's AV port to give the Nintendo 64 RF compatibility. The RF switch itself is identical in every way to the RF switches released for Nintendo's prior systems (the NES and the SNES) and can be interchanged if needed. This set was later re-released for the GameCube to give it RF capability. The cables intended for the GameCube will also work with the Nintendo 64 and SNES.\n\nEuro Connector Plug\nThe Euro Connector Plug is an adaptor packaged with European releases of the console, which converts RCA composite and stereo cable inputs to Composite SCART.\n\nVideo capture cassette\nThe video capture cassette, or cartridge, (NUS-028) for use on the  64DD game series. The back of the cartridge has audio, video, and microphone input jacks through which it can collect video and audio data. It was bundled with the 64DD game.\n\nModem\nThe modem cartridge (NUS-029) connects at up to , formerly for use with the Randnet service and compatible 64DD games and web browser.\n\nPower supply\nThe power supply (NUS-002, UKV-EUR-AUS-JPN-USA) provides electricity to the Control Deck.\n\nKeyboard\nThe compact keyboard is for use with the Randnet service and compatible 64DD games.\n\nSmartMedia\n\nSmartMedia memory cards for use with the game  contain images, backgrounds, borders, and other media assets to be used while editing the user photos.\nThere are at least six different cards:\n Illustrations - \n Illustrations - \n Characters collection - \n Characters collection - \n Characters collection - \n Characters collection - \n Characters collection - \n Characters collection - \n Characters collection - \n Characters collection - \n\nThe cards are all 3.3\u00a0V 2\u00a0MB SmartMedia memory cards manufactured by Hagiwara Sys-Com. The Mario no Photopi game was bundled with an empty memory SmartMedia card for storing the user creations.\n\nLicensed\n\nASCIIWHEEL 64\nThe ASCIIWHEEL 64 is an alternate controller shaped as a steering wheel for driving games. It includes a slot for the Controller Pak and other controller accessories.\n\nBio Sensor\n\nThe Bio Sensor (NUS-A-BIO-JPN) is an ear clip that plugs into the Controller Pak slot of the controller to measure the user's heart rate. It was manufactured by Seta and released only in Japan. It is compatible only with Tetris 64, which slows down or speeds up depending on how fast the player's heart is beating. This device is similar to the unreleased Wii Vitality Sensor.\n\nTsuricon 64\nThe  (ASC-0905) is a fishing controller manufactured by ASCII Corporation and compatible with a few fishing games released in Japan, like , , or\n\nDensha de Go! 64 controller\nA train controller compatible with just one game:  It is similar to other controllers for the same game series on different platforms such as Dreamcast and PlayStation. The game optionally supports the VRU.\n\nSystem Organizer\nNintendo licensed A.L.S. Industries to make two types of black wooden system organizers.  Both feature a plastic drawer, bearing a Nintendo 64 sticker, with slots designed to hold Nintendo 64 game cartridges, controllers, and Controller Paks.\n\nTraveling accessories\nThe Messenger Bag is a black bag made to carry on the left side of the body. It is branded on the front with the Nintendo 64 logo and name. It comes with zippered compartments on the outside and inside and with mesh pockets, for a few games and a controller.\n\nNintendo licensed a Traveling Case\u2014a black bag, with the Nintendo 64 name stitched on the front. Two plastic buckles on the front keep the bag closed. It is made to carry the Nintendo 64 system with controllers, games, and accessories. They also made a standard black backpack with the Nintendo 64 logo on the top and a zippered compartment on the front.\n\nCamera\nA basic 35\u00a0mm camera, complete with a timer and flash. Official cameras have a Nintendo 64 logo on the front. They come in different colors such as blue and orange.\n\nDevelopment and backup\n\nNintendo's original development environment for Nintendo 64 software is a card made by SGI containing most of a Nintendo 64 console, plus a software development kit (SDK), for self-hosted installation in an SGI Indy workstation.\n\nThe second generation moved to a much cheaper partner model between a normal Nintendo 64 console and a PC, by providing a cartridge form factor holding flash storage with a cable connection to a PC. Nintendo officially licensed SN Systems to make the SN Systems dev kit and SN Maestro 64, the second generation of Nintendo 64 SDK in PC partner form to replace the Indy-hosted hardware solution. Unofficial kits include IS-VIEWER 64 and Partner 64. The Monegi Smart Pack is a collection of third-party hardware and software which can be used to do real-time development while the game is running on the console.\n\nThrough the decades, many unlicensed third-party peripheral devices provide many consumer-friendly alternative storage mediums for retail Nintendo 64 consoles, bypassing console security for the purpose of development or for users making backups of game cartridges and save data. The Doctor V64 is a CD-ROM peripheral designed by Bung Enterprises Ltd and released in 1996. It plugs into the Nintendo 64's underside expansion slot, and uses a lockout-bypass adaptor that fits into the cartridge port into which any retail cartridge is inserted for use of its lockout chip by proxy. The Doctor V64 Jr. is a cheaper, condensed version that fits into the cartridge port and provides a parallel port connection to a PC. Bung made the DX 256 Super Game Saver which stores 256 battery EEPROM save states, and the DS1 Super Doctor Save Card. The CD 64 is a CD-ROM drive developed by UFO/Success Company. Mr. Backup Z64 designed by Harrison Electronics, Inc. is a ZIP drive peripheral for creating writable backups and performing playback of any Nintendo 64 cartridge. The modern Everdrive 64, ED64 Plus, N64 Neo Myth, and 64Drive use SD cards for mass storage of ROM image files or USB cables to connect to a PC for transfer.\n\nUnlicensed\n\n Glove Controller is a wearable controller with buttons like a normal controller, usable in any game.\n Tilt Pak is a rumble feedback and motion sensor made by Pelican.\n GameShark is an unlicensed cheat device made by Interact in two versions. The first version has an LED display and a slot on the back of the unit for an expansion card that was never made. The second version (known as the \"Pro\" series, versions 3.2 and up) has a parallel port on the back for connecting to a computer for game downloads.  GameShark cards (or Action Replay cards in Europe) can be used to access cheat content.\n SharkWire Online is an InterAct GameShark with modem and PC style serial port for keyboards. It allowed emailing and Game Shark updates through the now discontinued sharkwire.com dial-in service.\n GB Hunter is a Game Boy player, similar to the first-party Super Game Boy for the SNES.\n High Rez Pack \u2014 Mad Catz's less-expensive version of the Expansion Pak. There were reports of overheating due to inadequate cooling/venting, and the unit suffered from poor build quality.\n N64 Passport is an adaptor and cheat device allowing players to play games from different regions, with a few exceptions.\n Memory Card Comfort by Speed-Link is a controller expansion with four separate memory areas, and 123 pages each, selectable via a small switch.\n Tremor Pak is a third-party rumble expansion.\n The Nyko Hyper Pak Plus contains internal memory and a rumble feature.\n Advanced Controller is a Mad Catz gamepad with the same form and controls as the standard Nintendo 64 controller, plus a turbo button.\n Mad Catz Steering Wheel is a set consisting of an analog steering wheel that turns 270 degrees, two foot pedals, and a stick shift.\n Power Wheel is a steering wheel with foot pedal module produced by Game Source.\n V3 Racing Wheel is a steering wheel with foot pedals produced by Interact. It includes an expansion port which does not support the Rumble Pak, due to the risk that it would grate on the player's crotch.\n Flight Force Pro 64 is a flight stick from InterAct.\n Arcade Shark is an arcade-style joystick controller from InterAct, with slow motion and auto-fire buttons.\n Tristar 64 is a third-party adaptor enabling NES and SNES games on Nintendo 64. The device expands the cartridge slot into three total slots for each cartridge type.\n Interact reportedly had two Nintendo 64 light guns \"packed and ready to ship\", one of them with built-in force feedback, but never released them due to the complete lack of light gun shooters for the console.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\n \nNintendo 64", "machine_text": "Nintendo 64 Accessories The Nintendo 64, commonly called the N64, was a home video game console developed by Nintendo and released in 1996. It was the company's third console and the first to feature 3D graphics. While the N64 had an extensive library of games, it also offered a range of accessories that added new features and functionality to the system. Expansion Pak The Expansion Pak was an optional accessory that increased the N64's RAM from 4MB to 8MB, allowing for improved graphics and more complex games. It was required for certain games, such as The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, and could be inserted into a port on the top of the N64. Rumble Pak The Rumble Pak was a device that added force feedback to the N64 controller. It vibrated in response to in-game actions, such as crashes or explosions, adding a new level of immersion to gameplay. The Rumble Pak was sold separately and required two AAA batteries to operate. Controller Pak The Controller Pak was a small memory card that could be inserted into the back of the N64 controller. It allowed players to save game progress, high scores, and settings for certain games. The Controller Pak was available in different sizes, ranging from 1MB to 4MB. Transfer Pak The Transfer Pak allowed players to transfer data between N64 games and Game Boy games. It had a slot for inserting Game Boy cartridges and a port for connecting to the N64 controller. Some N64 games, such as Pokemon Stadium, utilized the Transfer Pak for additional gameplay options. Conclusion The N64 offered a range of accessories that enhanced the gaming experience and allowed for new gameplay possibilities. The Expansion Pak, Rumble Pak, Controller Pak, and Transfer Pak were just a few of the accessories available for the N64.

Sand colored with a velvety texture, the species expresses pentamerism or pentaradial symmetry as adults. The five gently tapering arms have conspicuous bands of long white marginal spines in groups of three. Luidia sarsi grow to approximately 20\u00a0cm across and are found in deeper water (20\u00a0m+) from Norway to the Mediterranean but in deep colder water in the south. They are usually found on muddy sediment and are most active at night, burying themselves under the sand during the day. Luidia sarsii larva develop from a fertilized egg and are unique in a number of respects. The larva of the species attains an unusual size (up to 35\u00a0mm) and a juvenile starfish develops inside the larva. During metamorphosis the juvenile migrates to the outside and detaches from the swimming larval bipinnaria stage. The larva continues to live separately for several months.\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\n \n\nLuidia\nFauna of the Atlantic Ocean\nFauna of the Mediterranean Sea\nAnimals described in 1846", "machine_text": "Luidia sarsii is a species of starfish that belongs to the family Luidiidae. It is commonly known as the spider starfish or the North Atlantic sea star. The species was first described by the Norwegian zoologist G.O. Sars in 1861. Distribution and Habitat: Luidia sarsii is found in the northern Atlantic Ocean, including the North Sea and the coasts of Norway, Greenland, Iceland, and eastern Canada. They prefer to inhabit rocky areas with a depth range of 15-300 meters, but can also be found in soft seabed like mud or sand. Description: Luidia sarsii has a flat, star-shaped body that has a combination of brown, red, and orange colors. They are quite large and can have five to seven arms, which are very long - about three to four times the length of the central disk. The arms are broad, tapering, and helically twisted when detached from the body. The ventral grooves on the arms are covered in tiny bristle-like spines, which they use to move and capture prey. Behavior and Diet: Luidia sarsii is a carnivorous animal that feeds on a wide range of organisms including clams, snails, crabs, and sea urchins. It captures its prey by extending its arms and enveloping its target, before retracting the arms to bring the prey towards its mouth. The species is nocturnal and is often found feeding at night. Conservation: There is insufficient information on the conservation status of Luidia sarsii. However, like other marine animals, it is threatened by pollution, habitat degradation, and overfishing. Therefore, there is a need for the implementation of conservation measures to reduce these threats.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 24378519}

He ran as the more radical candidate after being supported by left-wing figures, including shadow Chancellor John McDonnell, Noam Chomsky, Paul Mason, Clive Lewis and Laura Pidcock. He also had organisational support from Unite the Union, Momentum, RMT, Fire Brigades Union, TSSA and Aslef. \n\nDriscoll ran on a platform with five primary pledges:\n\n Community Wealth Building\n Green Industrial Revolution\n Setting up Community Hubs\n Build Affordable Homes\n Meaningful Adult Education\n\nDriscoll won the 2019 North of Tyne mayoral election with 56.1% of the vote. Upon taking office, he became entitled to the style of Mayor. As well as being elected as the first North of Tyne mayor, Driscoll was also the first metro mayor backed by Momentum.\n\nDriscoll called a climate emergency on the day he was elected. In August 2019, he complained that not much progress had been made on his policies in the first 100 days as the combined authority still needed to find its feet. Since then, he has invested in the economy to create 2000 jobs, funded a non-coercive Working Homes programme to empower social housing residents with new skills, launched a Climate Change teachers programme partnering with the United Nations and put money into rural broadband infrastructure. He has also funded organisations like Kielder Observatory to get more children into STEM subjects, and funded a youth outreach project in collaboration with Newcastle United F.C.\n\nDriscoll has stated his desire for all seven North East local authorities to come together to reform the original North East Combined Authority, made up of Northumberland County Council, Newcastle City Council, North Tyneside Council, Gateshead Council, South Tyneside Council, Sunderland City Council and Durham County Council.\n\nPersonal life \nDriscoll is married and has two children.

In 2016 he was shortlisted for a head office position with the Labour Party but was not selected. He then became the party's first-ever regional director for the North East of England. In this role, he was instrumental in organizing the Sunderland Labour Party's vote to leave the European Union, despite Labour's official policy being to remain. He resigned from this role in 2018 to launch a campaign for the newly created North of Tyne mayoralty. Driscoll's mayoral campaign focused on social and environmental justice. He pledged to make council housing carbon-neutral, invest in renewable energy, improve public transport, increase funding for mental health, and tackle poverty. Driscoll secured the Labour party nomination and won the election in May 2019. His victory was a major upset, as the North of Tyne Authority had previously been controlled by the Conservative party. As North of Tyne mayor, Driscoll has been vocal in his support for various progressive policies and initiatives. He has lobbied for more funding for the region, advocated for workers' rights, and called for better public services.

It parallels to the Arroyo Seco Parkway (CA Route 110) also in the canyon.\n\nDescription\nThe bicycle path connects: Montecito Heights at Ernest E. Debs Regional Park and the Montecito Heights Recreation Center; Hermon at Hermon Park and Ernest E. Debs Regional Park; and Highland Park at Sycamore Grove Park -- to the city of South Pasadena at the Arroyo Seco Stables.  The pathway travels under the cover of tall California sycamore and California oak trees\n\nThe southwest portion of the path, approximately , runs along the top of the channel and overlooks the Arroyo Seco through chain-link fencing. It then descends into the bed of Arroyo Seco flood control channel for the rest of the route. Following the channel hydraulics, there is a  slight and consistent uphill grade in the northeast/upstream direction, with some sections under overpasses having slightly greater slopes.\n\nParking and access are located at Hermon Park/Arroyo Seco Park, Sycamore Grove Park, Ernest E. Debs Regional Park, and the Montecito Heights Recreation Center. The Sycamore Grove Park access is via a pedestrian bridge over the Arroyo Seco.  The path crosses several other pedestrian and vehicular bridges along its route.\n\nClosures\nFor flood safety reasons, if rain is predicted or if water release is expected from the upstream dam, public access is not permitted in the channel.\n\nConnectivity\nThe path continues as a walking and equestrian trail from its northern terminus, with only pedestrians and horses allowed beyond the Arroyo Seco Stables. However, bicyclists can continue on the Kenneth Newell Bikeway along Arroyo Boulevard just to the east, a quiet residential street that continues north in the Arroyo Seco to the Rose Bowl Stadium in Pasadena.  \n\nFrom the path's southern terminus, the open air Heritage Square Museum and the Lummis House and gardens are nearby. Connections southwards to the Los Angeles River Bicycle Path several miles away are via the vehicle shared Figuroa Street to Riverside Drive.\n\nMaintenance\nThe Arroyo Seco Bicycle Path is maintained by City of Los Angeles.  The Arroyo Seco river channel that the bike path is located in is maintained by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works.\n\nHazards\nEspecially after rain events, storm-borne debris accumulate on the path and pose danger to cyclist and pedestrians. Other hazards include trash and debris, such as beverage bottles, shopping carts, and electronics that are being illegally discarded into the channel from bridge overpasses. Due to periodical maintenance activities, the path is usually clear from any debris and provides an enjoyable recreational area.\n\nSee also\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Arroyo Seco Foundation: The Arroyo Seco Bikeway\n\nBike paths in Los Angeles\nArroyo Seco (Los Angeles County)\nNortheast Los Angeles\nParks in Los Angeles County, California\nHighland Park, Los Angeles\nMontecito Heights, Los Angeles\nSouth Pasadena, California", "machine_text": "Arroyo Seco Bicycle Path is a cycling route that runs through the Arroyo Seco Park in Los Angeles, California.

Bart, Lisa, and Groundskeeper Willie go back to the water park to free the whale trapped in it, with Bart finally understanding altruism and liking it. Homer takes the family on a ride on his boat called the 'Something's Fishy' and even Marge agrees it was a good idea to buy it.\n\nThe next rider on the boat is Grampa. But when they return to the pier, the boat starts sinking and Raphael offers his help as a mechanic while Bart is sharing a plan with Milhouse to free other animals in his newfound spirit of altruism.\n\nHomer offers Lenny and Carl to share the boat, and the expenses to fix it. Bart and Milhouse go to the Springfield Zoo and free a gorilla named Lolo, but he goes on a rampage while Milhouse narrowly escapes getting eaten by two tigers.\n\nBart calls Lisa for help since the police are useless on capturing Lolo. Homer starts co-owning the boat with even more people and the boat sinks due to the weight. Lolo rampages at the Springfield Elementary School and Lisa stops him using Seinfeld to calm him down.\n\nLisa takes Lolo home to help him go back to a life of freedom and takes him to Dr. Jane Goodall at the Pennsylvania Ape Reserve where he will be loved.

The Simpsons\u2019 world is made up of outlandish situations rendered possible, sometimes even plausible, by animation and the show's forgiving rules of reality. Some of the best episodes sound just as sparse in outline. Homer goes to space. Springfield gets a monorail. Lisa and Bart thwart a supervillain's plot to drown Springfield.\"\n\nTony Sokol of Den of Geek gave the episode a 2.5 out of 5, stating that the episode \"doesn't truly shine. There are a lot of very funny lines and gags, but nothing which truly distinguishes it as comic gold. This isn't the fault of Lisa's social justice warmongering. Kent Brockman offers cutting commentary after Lolo wreaks havoc on Springfield saying, 'The police, as always, are useless.' Which cuts to a scene where Springfield's bluest kill a perfectly harmless balloon.

The phrase is often used in a political context, where a particular party or group establishes a strong hold on government, but it can be applied to other situations as well. The term \"Gorillas on the Mast\" comes from the idea that gorillas are the dominant species in their natural habitat and that they are known for their strength and power. The use of this phrase has a long history that can be traced back to the early 20th century. During this time, it was used to describe the dominance of certain political parties in different countries, particularly in Europe. In the post-World War II period, the phrase became more widespread and began to be used to describe the dominance of the Soviet Union in Eastern Europe. Today, the phrase continues to be used to describe situations where one group or organization has a strong hold on power. It can be applied to many different situations, including corporate monopolies, political totalitarianism, or even social movements that seek to impose their will on others. Regardless of the context in which it is used, the phrase \"Gorillas on the Mast\" carries a certain connotation of strength and power. It suggests that those in control have the ability to shape the course of events and exercise significant influence over the lives of others.

In later life he was considered an eccentric.\n\nEarly life\nLord Rokeby was born Matthew Robinson in a large family from Yorkshire. His parents were Matthew Robinson (1694\u20131778) of Edgely and West Layton, Yorkshire, and Elizabeth, daughter of Robert Drake of Cambridge; his sisters included the novelists Elizabeth Montagu and Sarah Scott. Of his six brothers, Thomas the second was known as a legal writer, William the fifth as a cleric, and the youngest, Charles, as a Member of Parliament. His father inherited property in the neighbourhood of Rokeby from his great-uncle Matthew Robinson, rector of Burneston; and his mother inherited the Mount Morris estate at Monks Horton, near Hythe, Kent, from her brother Morris Drake Morris, which Rokeby in turn succeeded to in 1746.\n\nRobinson was admitted to Lincoln's Inn in 1730, and to Trinity Hall, Cambridge in 1731. He became a Fellow there in 1734. In 1746 his mother died and he inherited her Monks Horton property. As a consequence, he then assumed the additional name of Morris.\n\nIn November 1746 he became a Fellow of the Royal Society. The Royal Society citation reads: Mathew Robinson Esqr, A Gentleman well versed in Philosophical Learning, and polite Literature; being desirous of becoming a fellow of this Society, We on our personal knowledge do recommend him as every way qualified and likely to become a usefull Member of our Body. His proposers were Edw Montagu (brother-in-law); Daniel Wray; Geo Lewis Scott (brother-in-law); Henry Baker; Robt Smith; M Folkes.\n\nHe was elected as a Bailiff to the board of the Bedford Level Corporation in 1756, a position he held until 1763.\n\nRobinson-Morris represented Canterbury in Parliament, from 1747 to 1761; in politics he was a Whig. He inherited the title Lord Rokeby in 1794 after the death of his father's second  cousin, The 1st Baron Rokeby, Church of Ireland Lord Primate of All Ireland and Lord Archbishop of Armagh.\n\nSupposed eccentric\n\nThe 2nd Lord Rokeby became an enthusiastic supporter of baths during a holiday in the spa town of Aix-la-Chapelle. When he returned to Kent, he began to make daily trips to the seashore to swim in salt water regardless of the weather. He preferred this environment to such an extent that his servant had to persuade him to come home. Sometimes he fainted and had to be rescued. He had a hut built for him on the sands at Hythe and drinking fountains along his route to the beach. He walked all the way and let his servant follow him in the carriage with full livery. If he found people drinking from a fountain, he gave them a half-crown coin.\n\nHe also let his beard grow, which was against the contemporary fashion. Eventually it was so thick that it stuck out under his arms and could be seen from behind.  In a couple of years he decided to build a swimming pool in his mansion - it was built under glass and was heated by sun. There he spent hours at the time, preferably alone. He refused to have a fire in his house even in the coldest weather.\n\nHis increased isolation bred rumours, including one that he was a cannibal or ate only raw meat - when he ate mainly beef tea and nibbled at venison. He also refused to see any doctors. As for church service, he claimed that God was best worshipped at natural altars of the earth, the sea and the sky - not to mention that the sermons were boring.\n\nWhen Lord Rokeby did indeed agree to accept visitors, he might \"entertain\" them with lengthy, boring poems. He arranged a sumptuous meal for Prince William of Gloucester but ate very little himself. He very rarely visited the court and then was an embarrassment to his socialite sister, Elizabeth Montagu. When he stayed at the Chequers Inn at Lenham in 1796 so he could vote in the general election, curious locals took him for a Turk.\n\nIn January 1755 Mrs. Montagu wrote to their sister, Sarah Scott:\n'Brother Robinson is emulating the great Diogenes and other ... doctors of the stoic fur; he flies the life of London and leads a life of such privacy and seriousness as looks to the beholder like wisdom', and in 1756 she reported that he now lived upon almost raw meat, never touched bread, considering corn exotic, and for the same reason substituted honey for sugar.\n\nDeath\nLord Rokeby died in December 1800, peacefully in his bed.  His title and estates passed to his nephew Morris Robinson, 3rd Baron Rokeby. His tomb in Armagh Cathedral is sculpted by John Bacon.\n\nReferences\n\nEdith Sitwell, English Eccentrics: A gallery of weird and wonderful men and women, Harmondsworth: Penguin (1983), pp.\u00a047\u201355.\n\nAttribution\n\n.\n\n1712 births\n1800 deaths\nBarons in the Peerage of Ireland\nFellows of Trinity Hall, Cambridge\nMembers of the Parliament of Great Britain for English constituencies\nBritish MPs 1747\u20131754\nBritish MPs 1754\u20131761\nFellows of the Royal Society", "machine_text": "Matthew Robinson, 2nd Baron Rokeby was an English peer and politician who lived during the 18th century.

As a young man, Robinson travelled extensively throughout Europe, where he made numerous connections with influential people. He was known for his brilliant wit and his talent for writing and published a number of poems and plays during his lifetime. In addition to his literary pursuits, Robinson was an accomplished politician and served as a Member of Parliament for Canterbury from 1747 to 1754. In 1754, Robinson married his cousin, Elizabeth Montagu, who was famous for her involvement in the bluestocking society. Together they had no children, but they enjoyed a long and happy marriage until Elizabeth's death in 1800. During his later years, Robinson retired from public life and spent much of his time at his country estate, Mount Morris, in Yorkshire. He was also a patron of the arts and supported the work of many contemporary artists and writers. Today, Robinson is remembered as a gifted writer and politician who played an important role in shaping the literary and political landscape of 18th century England.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Third Mind Records\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Third Mind Records was a British independent record label, founded in February 1983 by Gary Levermore.\n\nName\nThe label derived its name from the book The Third Mind, a work compiled by Beat Generation author William S. Burroughs and artist Brion Gysin using the cut-up technique.\n\nHistory\nThird Mind originated from the group and fanzine Tone Death that Levermore had founded in the middle of 1982 together with two friends. During that time Levermore started contacting bands he had discovered through diverse media and on concerts which would finally be featured in Tone Death. While writing the editorial for the second issue of the fanzine, to be released around February 1983, Levermore \"began considering the possibility of releasing a cassette containing contributions by some of the groups that had been featured in the two issues to date.\" His considerations led to the double cassette release Rising From The Red Sand Vols. I&II which was followed by volumes III and IV in 1983. The compilations featured a number of post-punk, electronic and industrial bands some of which would be later on the label's roster, and sped up Levermore's \"transition from zine enthusiast into label owner.\"\n\nThe Rising From The Red Sand series was met with stronger demands than Levermore had anticipated. Sending promo copies to some shops and getting a five star review in Sounds magazine led to a great number of order requests. The London-based shop of Rough Trade ordered a substantial number of copies. \"Those compilations sold quite well\", remembered Levermore, \"and more or less provided the fund base to actually put out three or four albums.\"\n\nAfter this initial success Third Mind developed slowly, with an annual quantity of seven or eight records in the first years. Levermore had to deal with tight budgets, the label's artists recorded \"for very, very low sums of money.\" Signing Canadian industrial band Front Line Assembly and British singer-songwriter Bill Pritchard in 1987 meant a major step forward for the label making them the label's flagships in different markets and entailing also further post-Third Mind management duties.\n\nAll of the label's releases until after Front Line Assembly's 1990 album Caustic Grip were licensed to American independent label Wax Trax.\n\nThird Mind started off with Rough Trade as distributor which changed between 1987 and 1988 when the label switched to Play It Again Sam. Due to \"policy differences\" Third Mind and Play It Again Sam terminated their partnership and in 1992 Levermore moved on to partner with American metal label Roadrunner Records. In 1991, Roadrunner had already bought a 50 percent stake of Third Mind which gave Levermore a greater financial leeway since Roadrunner paid Levermore \"a salary for three years to continue running the label while they financed new releases.\" Before Roadrunner, Levermore said, \"there's been many occasions over the years when I've seen a band that I wanted to work with go somewhere else and have a bit of success.\"\n\nLevermore and Roadrunner ended their collaboration in April 1994. When Third Mind ended its business activities in the same year, it had released more than 100 titles.

They were defeated by Jason and the Argonauts, who would have been lost and killed by the rocks except for Phineus' advice. Jason let a dove fly between the rocks to see exactly how fast they'd have to row to beat the rocks; the dove lost only its tail feathers. The Argonauts rowed mightily to get through and lost only part of the stern ornament. After that, the Symplegades stopped moving permanently.\n\nThe European rock is usually identified with an islet, about  wide and  long, which stands about  off the shore of a village called Rumelifeneri ('Lighthouse of Rumeli\u2019), and is connected to it by a modern concrete jetty. At its highest point, there is an ancient altar known as the Pillar of Pompey, though it has nothing to do with Pompey.  Dionysius of Byzantium mentions a Roman shrine to Apollo on one of the Cyanean Rocks, and the 16th-century French traveller Petrus Gyllius thought the altar was a remnant of that shrine.\n\nThe Asian rock is probably a reef off the Yum Burnu (north of Anadolu Feneri 'Lighthouse of Anatolia'), described by Gyllius:\nThe reef is divided into four rocks above water which, however, are joined below; it is separated from the continent by a narrow channel filled with many stones, by which as by a staircase one can cross the channel with dry feet when the sea is calm; but when the sea is rough, waves surround the four rocks into which I said the reef is divided.  Three of these are low and more or less submerged, but the middle one is higher than the European rock, sloping up to an acute point and roundish right up to its summit; it is splashed by the waves but not submerged and is everywhere precipitous and straight.\n\nNames\n\nThe Romans called them Cyaneae Insulae (\"Blue Islands\"), and in Turkish they are called \u00d6reke Ta\u015f\u0131 (\"Distaff Rock\" or \"Midwife's Stool\").\n\nIn literature\n\nLord Byron refers to the Symplegades in the concluding stanzas of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage:\n\nThe New Critic I. A. Richards refers to 'Symplegades' in his work Practical Criticism. In Chapter 2, 'Figurative Language', he refers to dangers of misinterpretation in reading poems:\n\"These twin dangers - careless, 'intuitive' reading and prosaic, 'over-literal' reading - are the Symplegades, the 'justling rocks', between which too many ventures into poetry are wrecked.\"\n\nIn his 1961 novel Jason, Henry Treece depicts the Symplegades as icebergs that drifted downriver into the Black Sea.\n\nThe Wandering Rocks\n\nThe Symplegades are sometimes identified with (or confused with) the Planctae () or Wandering Rocks, which are mentioned in the Odyssey and Apollonius of Rhodes' Argonautica.  In Apollonius's telling, the Symplegades were encountered on the way to the Golden Fleece and the Planctae were encountered on the return voyage.\n\nThe similarities and differences between the Wandering Rocks and the Symplegades have been much debated by scholars, as have potential locations for them.

According to the legend, the Symplegades were located at the entrance of the Black Sea, blocking any ships from entering or leaving the region. The Symplegades were said to be used as a challenge for the Argonauts, a group of heroes that were led by Jason in his quest for the Golden Fleece. To navigate through the Clashing Rocks, Jason sought the help of the goddess Athena, who provided him with a strategy. She advised him to send a dove ahead of the ship, and when it flew successfully through the rocks, it was safe for the Argo to follow. In some versions of the story, the Symplegades were also known as the Planctae, meaning rovers, as they were said to wander the seas. In other legends, it was believed that the Symplegades were the petrified remains of two sea monsters, Scylla and Charybdis, who were turned into rocks by the gods. The Symplegades have had a lasting impact on Greek culture, and have been referenced in various literary works such as \"The Odyssey\" by Homer and \"The Argonautica\" by Apollonius of Rhodes. In modern times, the Symplegades have been used as a metaphor for challenges and obstacles that need to be navigated, particularly in the realm of business and entrepreneurship. While the Symplegades are purely mythical, the concept of hazardous rocks and shallow waters that pose a danger to passing ships was very real. The ancient Greeks were known for their seafaring and trade, and such obstacles presented a very real threat to their livelihoods. In conclusion, the Symplegades are a fascinating mythological feature that has captured the imagination of readers for centuries. They represent the challenges and obstacles that we all must face in life, and the importance of seeking guidance and strategy to navigate through them safely.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 80996}

Prime Suspect is based on the British television series of the same name, which aired in the UK from 1991 to 2006. However, the American version of the show differs from the original in several significant ways, including the setting, the characters, and the storylines. In the American version, Jane Timoney is a seasoned detective from Brooklyn who transfers to the NYPD's homicide division in Manhattan. She faces constant scrutiny and skepticism from her male colleagues, who doubt her capabilities as a woman in the male-dominated field. Despite the challenges she faces, Timoney is a determined and skilled detective who is dedicated to solving every case she is assigned. Throughout the series, she takes on a variety of complex cases, including a serial killer who targets young women and a case involving a missing teenage girl. The show received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised Bello's performance as Timoney and the show's depiction of the challenges faced by women in law enforcement. However, despite its critical acclaim, Prime Suspect was canceled after only one season due to low ratings. In addition to Bello, the show also starred Aidan Quinn, Kirk Acevedo, Brian O'Byrne, and Tim Griffin. The show was created by Alexandra Cunningham and was produced by Universal Television and ITV Studios America.

Born in Ukraine, Semion Slepakov moved to Canada in 1990 where he studied engineering and later worked as an acoustics consultant. During this time, he was also developing his interest in music composition and production. Slepakov's early work in electronic music was heavily influenced by the experimental sounds of early 20th-century composers like Iannis Xenakis and Karlheinz Stockhausen. In the late 1990s, Slepakov began performing as Szkieve, and quickly gained a reputation for his live performances, which often included live improvised multimedia elements like video and lighting. Szkieve's approach to music often involves the use of unconventional instruments like broken circuit boards and contact microphones, and his sound has been described as both rhythmic and atmospheric. Szkieve's debut release, entitled \"Fragments of Hunting Metaphors,\" was released on France's Ant-Zen record label in 2000, and was followed by several other releases, including \"Atavism Dream\" and \"Des Yoyos Dances.\" Szkieve has also worked on numerous collaborative projects with other experimental electronic musicians like Zbigniew Karkowski and Francisco L\u00f3pez. In addition to his work in music, Szkieve has also composed music for independent films and installations, and has collaborated with visual artists, dancers, and choreographers. His work has been featured in festivals and exhibitions around the world, including Ars Electronica in Austria, MUTEK in Montreal, and Transmediale in Berlin. Szkieve's approach to music and sound is highly experimental and unconventional, and he continues to push the boundaries of electronic music with his work.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 10451306}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Pope Francis\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Pope Francis (; ; ; born Jorge Mario Bergoglio, 17 December 1936) is the head of the Catholic Church and sovereign of the Vatican City State since 2013. Francis is the first pope to be a member of the Society of Jesus, the first from the Americas, the first from the Southern Hemisphere, and the first pope from outside Europe since Gregory III, a Syrian who reigned in the 8th century.\n\nBorn in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Bergoglio worked for a time as a bouncer and a janitor as a young man before training to be a chemist and working as a technician in a food science laboratory. After recovering from a severe illness, he was inspired to join the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits) in 1958. He was ordained a Catholic priest in 1969, and from 1973 to 1979 was the Jesuit provincial superior in Argentina. He became the archbishop of Buenos Aires in 1998 and was created a cardinal in 2001 by Pope John Paul II. He led the Argentine Church during the December 2001 riots in Argentina. The administrations of N\u00e9stor Kirchner and Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner considered him to be a political rival. Following the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI on 28 February 2013, a papal conclave elected Bergoglio as his successor on 13 March. He chose Francis as his papal name in honor of Saint Francis of Assisi. Throughout his public life, Francis has been noted for his humility, emphasis on God's mercy, international visibility as pope, concern for the poor, and commitment to interreligious dialogue. He is credited with having a less formal approach to the papacy than his predecessors, for instance choosing to reside in the Domus Sanctae Marthae guesthouse rather than in the papal apartments of the Apostolic Palace used by previous popes.\n\nFrancis maintains the traditional views of the Church regarding abortion, clerical celibacy, and the ordination of women, but has initiated dialogue on the possibility of deaconesses and has made women full members of dicasteries in the Roman Curia. He maintains that the Church should be more open and welcoming for members of the LGBT community. Francis is an outspoken critic of unbridled capitalism and free market economics, consumerism, and overdevelopment, and advocates taking action on climate change, a focus of his papacy with the promulgation of Laudato si'. In international diplomacy, he helped to restore full diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba and supported the cause of refugees during the European and Central American migrant crises. Since 2018, he has been an opponent of populism. He has faced criticism from theological conservatives on many questions, including his promotion of ecumenism, as well as admitting civilly divorced and remarried Catholics to communion with the publication of Amoris laetitia.\n\nEarly years \n\nJorge Mario Bergoglio was born on 17 December 1936 in Flores, a neighborhood of Buenos Aires. He was the eldest of five children of Mario Jos\u00e9 Bergoglio (1908\u20131959) and Regina Mar\u00eda S\u00edvori (1911\u20131981). Mario Bergoglio was an Italian immigrant accountant born in Portacomaro (Province of Asti) in Italy's Piedmont region. Regina S\u00edvori was a housewife born in Buenos Aires to a family of northern Italian (Piedmontese-Genoese) origin. Mario Jos\u00e9's family left Italy in 1929 to escape the fascist rule of Benito Mussolini. According to Mar\u00eda Elena Bergoglio (b. 1948), the pope's only living sibling, they did not emigrate for economic reasons. His other siblings were Alberto Horacio (1942\u20132010), Oscar Adri\u00e1n (1938\u2013deceased) and Marta Regina (1940\u20132007). Two great-nephews, Antonio and Joseph, died in a traffic collision. His niece, Cristina Bergoglio, is a painter based in Madrid, Spain.\n\nIn the sixth grade, Bergoglio attended Wilfrid Bar\u00f3n de los Santos \u00c1ngeles, a school of the Salesians of Don Bosco, in Ramos Mej\u00eda, Buenos Aires Province. He attended the technical secondary school Escuela T\u00e9cnica Industrial N\u00b0 27 Hip\u00f3lito Yrigoyen, named after a past Argentine president, and graduated with a chemical technician's diploma (not a master's degree in chemistry, as some media outlets incorrectly reported). In that capacity, he spent several years working in the food section of Hickethier-Bachmann Laboratory, where he worked under Esther Ballestrino. Prior to working as a chemical technician, Bergoglio had also worked as a bar bouncer and as a janitor sweeping floors.\n\nWhen he was 21 years old, he suffered from life-threatening pneumonia and three cysts. He had part of a lung excised shortly afterwards. Bergoglio has been a lifelong supporter of San Lorenzo de Almagro football club. Bergoglio is also a fan of the films of Tita Merello, neorealism, and tango dancing, with a fondness for the traditional music of Argentina and Uruguay known as the milonga.\n\nJesuit (1958\u20132013) \nBergoglio found his vocation to the priesthood while he was on his way to celebrate the Spring Day. He passed by a church to go to confession, and was inspired by the priest. Bergoglio studied at the archdiocesan seminary, Inmaculada Concepci\u00f3n Seminary, in Villa Devoto, Buenos Aires, and, after three years, entered the Society of Jesus as a novice on 11 March 1958. Bergoglio has said that, as a young seminarian, he had a crush on a girl he met and briefly doubted about continuing the religious career. As a Jesuit novice he studied humanities in Santiago, Chile. After his novitiate in the Society of Jesus, Bergoglio officially became a Jesuit on 12 March 1960, when he made the religious profession of the initial, perpetual vows of poverty, chastity and obedience of a member of the order.\n\nIn 1960, Bergoglio obtained a licentiate in philosophy from the Colegio M\u00e1ximo de San Jos\u00e9 in San Miguel, Buenos Aires Province. He taught literature and psychology at the Colegio de la Inmaculada Concepci\u00f3n, a high school in Santa Fe, from 1964 to 1965. In 1966, he taught the same courses at the Colegio del Salvador in Buenos Aires.\n\nPresbyterate (1969\u20131992) \nIn 1967 Bergoglio began his theological studies at Facultades de Filosof\u00eda y Teolog\u00eda de San Miguel and on 13 December 1969 was ordained to the priesthood by Archbishop Ram\u00f3n Jos\u00e9 Castellano. He served as the master of novices for the province there and became a professor of theology.\n\nBergoglio completed his final stage of spiritual training as a Jesuit, tertianship, at Alcal\u00e1 de Henares, Spain, and took final, solemn vows as a Jesuit, including the fourth vow of obedience to missioning by the pope, on 22 April 1973. He was named provincial superior of the Society of Jesus in Argentina that July, for a six-year term which ended in 1979. In 1973, shortly after being named provincial superior, he had made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem but his stay was shortened by the outbreak of the Yom Kippur War. After the completion of his term of office, in 1980 he was named the rector of the Philosophical and Theological Faculty of San Miguel where he had studied. Before taking up this new appointment, he spent the first three months of 1980 in Ireland to learn English, staying at the Jesuit Centre at the Milltown Institute of Theology and Philosophy, Dublin. He served at San Miguel for six years until 1986 when, at the discretion of Jesuit superior-general Peter Hans Kolvenbach, he was replaced by someone more in tune with the worldwide trend in the Society of Jesus toward emphasizing social justice, rather than his emphasis on popular religiosity and direct pastoral work.\n\nHe spent several months at the Sankt Georgen Graduate School of Philosophy and Theology in Frankfurt, Germany, considering possible dissertation topics. He settled on exploring the work of the German / Italian theologian Romano Guardini, particularly his study of 'Contrast' published in his 1925 work Der Gegensatz. However, he was to return to Argentina prematurely to serve as a confessor and spiritual director to the Jesuit community in C\u00f3rdoba. In Germany, he saw the painting Mary, Untier of Knots in Augsburg and brought a copy of the painting to Argentina where it has become an important Marian devotion. As a student at the Salesian school, Bergoglio was mentored by Ukrainian Greek Catholic priest Stefan Czmil. Bergoglio often rose hours before his classmates to serve Mass for Czmil.\n\nBergoglio was asked in 1992 by Jesuit authorities not to reside in Jesuit houses, because of continued tensions with Jesuit leaders and scholars, a sense of Bergoglio's \"dissent,\" views of his Catholic orthodoxy and his opposition to theology of liberation, and his work as auxiliary bishop of Buenos Aires. As a bishop he was no longer subject to his Jesuit superior. From then on, he did not visit Jesuit houses and was in \"virtual estrangement from the Jesuits\" until after his election as pope.\n\nPre-papal episcopate (1992\u20132013) \nBergoglio was named Auxiliary Bishop of Buenos Aires in 1992 and consecrated on 27 June 1992 as titular bishop of Auca, with Cardinal Antonio Quarracino, archbishop of Buenos Aires, serving as principal consecrator. He chose as his episcopal motto Miserando atque eligendo. It is drawn from Saint Bede's homily on Matthew 9:9\u201313: \"because he saw him through the eyes of mercy and chose him\".\n\nOn 3 June 1997, Bergoglio was appointed coadjutor archbishop of Buenos Aires with right of succession. Upon Quarracino's death on 28 February 1998, Bergoglio became metropolitan archbishop of Buenos Aires. In that role, Bergoglio created new parishes and restructured the archdiocese administrative offices, led pro-life initiatives, and created a commission on divorces. One of Bergoglio's major initiatives as archbishop was to increase the Church's presence in the slums of Buenos Aires. Under his leadership, the number of priests assigned to work in the slums doubled. This work led to him being called the \"Slum Bishop\".\n\nEarly in his time as archbishop of Buenos Aires, Bergoglio sold off the archdiocese's shares in multiple banks and turned its accounts into those of a normal customer in international banks. The shares in banks had led the local church to a propensity towards high spending, and the archdiocese was nearing bankruptcy as a result. As a normal customer of the bank, the church was forced into a higher fiscal discipline.\n\nOn 6 November 1998, while remaining archbishop of Buenos Aires, he was named ordinary for those Eastern Catholics in Argentina who lacked a prelate of their own church. Major Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk said that Bergoglio understands the liturgy, rites, and spirituality of Shevchuk's Greek Catholic Church and always \"took care of our Church in Argentina\" as ordinary for Eastern Catholics during his time as archbishop of Buenos Aires.\n\nIn 2000, Bergoglio was the only church official to reconcile with Jer\u00f3nimo Podest\u00e1, a former bishop who had been suspended as a priest after opposing the Argentine Revolution military dictatorship in 1972. He defended Podest\u00e1's wife from Vatican attacks on their marriage. That same year, Bergoglio said the Argentine Catholic Church needed \"to put on garments of public penance for the sins committed during the years of the dictatorship\" in the 1970s, during the Dirty War.\n\nBergoglio made it his custom to celebrate the Holy Thursday ritual washing of feet in places such as jails, hospitals, retirement homes or slums. In 2007, just two days after Benedict XVI issued new rules for using the liturgical forms that preceded the Second Vatican Council, Cardinal Bergoglio established a fixed place for a weekly Mass in this extraordinary form of the Roman Rite. It was celebrated weekly.\n\nOn 8 November 2005, Bergoglio was elected president of the Argentine Episcopal Conference for a three-year term (2005\u201308). He was reelected to another three-year term on 11 November 2008. He remained a member of that commission's permanent governing body, president of its committee for the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina, and a member of its liturgy committee for the care of shrines. While head of the Argentine Catholic bishops' conference, Bergoglio issued a collective apology for his church's failure to protect people from the Junta during the Dirty War. When he turned 75 in December 2011, Bergoglio submitted his resignation as archbishop of Buenos Aires to Pope Benedict XVI as required by canon law. Still, as he had no coadjutor archbishop, he stayed in office, waiting for an eventual replacement appointed by the Vatican.\n\nCardinalate (2001\u20132013) \n\nAt the consistory of 21 February 2001, Archbishop Bergoglio was created a cardinal by Pope John Paul II with the title of cardinal priest of San Roberto Bellarmino, a church served by Jesuits and named for one; he was formally installed in that church the following 14 October. When he traveled to Rome for the ceremony, he and his sister Mar\u00eda Elena visited the village in northern Italy where their father was born. As cardinal, Bergoglio was appointed to five administrative positions in the Roman Curia. He was a member of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, the Congregation for the Clergy, the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life, the Pontifical Council for the Family and the Commission for Latin America. Later that year, when Cardinal Edward Egan returned to New York following the September 11 attacks, Bergoglio replaced him as relator (recording secretary) in the Synod of Bishops, and, according to the Catholic Herald, created \"a favourable impression as a man open to communion and dialogue\".\n\nCardinal Bergoglio became known for personal humility, doctrinal conservatism, and a commitment to social justice. A simple lifestyle contributed to his reputation for humility. He lived in a small apartment, rather than in the elegant bishop's residence in the suburb of Olivos. He took public transportation and cooked his own meals. He limited his time in Rome to \"lightning visits\". He was known to be devoted to St. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux, and he enclosed a small picture of her in the letters he wrote, calling her \"a great missionary saint\".\n\nAfter Pope John Paul II died on 2 April 2005, Bergoglio attended his funeral and was considered one of the papabile for succession to the papacy. He participated as a cardinal elector in the 2005 papal conclave that elected Pope Benedict XVI. In the National Catholic Reporter, John L. Allen Jr. reported that Bergoglio was a frontrunner in the 2005 conclave. In September 2005, the Italian magazine Limes published claims that Bergoglio had been the runner-up and main challenger to Cardinal Ratzinger at that conclave and that he had received 40 votes in the third ballot, but fell back to 26 at the fourth and decisive ballot. The claims were based on a diary purportedly belonging to an anonymous cardinal who had been present at the conclave. According to the Italian journalist Andrea Tornielli, this number of votes had no precedent for a Latin American papabile. La Stampa reported that Bergoglio was in close contention with Ratzinger during the election, until he made an emotional plea that the cardinals should not vote for him. According to Tornielli, Bergoglio made this request to prevent the conclave from delaying too much in the election of a pope.\n\nAs a cardinal, Bergoglio was associated with Communion and Liberation, a Catholic evangelical lay movement of the type known as associations of the faithful. He sometimes made appearances at the annual gathering known as the Rimini Meeting held during the late summer months in Italy. In 2005, Cardinal Bergoglio authorized the request for beatification\u2014the third step towards sainthood\u2014for six members of the Pallottine community murdered in the San Patricio Church massacre. At the same time, Bergoglio ordered an investigation into the murders themselves, which had been widely blamed on the National Reorganization Process, the military junta that ruled Argentina at the time.\n\nRelations with Argentine governments\n\nDirty War \n\nBergoglio was the subject of allegations regarding the Navy's kidnapping of two Jesuit priests, Orlando Yorio and Franz Jalics, in May 1976, during Argentina's Dirty War. He feared for the priests' safety and had tried to change their work prior to their arrest; however, contrary to reports, he never tried to throw them out of the Jesuit order. In 2005, Myriam Bregman, a human rights lawyer, filed a criminal complaint against Bergoglio, as superior in the Society of Jesus of Argentina, accusing him of involvement in the kidnapping. Her complaint did not specify how Bergoglio was involved; Bergoglio's spokesman flatly denied the allegations. The lawsuit was ultimately dismissed. The priests were tortured, but were found alive five months later, drugged and semi-naked. Yorio accused Bergoglio of effectively handing them over to the death squads by declining to tell the authorities that he endorsed their work. Yorio, who died in 2000, said in a 1999 interview that he believed that Bergoglio did nothing \"to free us, in fact just the opposite\". Jalics initially refused to discuss the complaint after moving into seclusion in a German monastery. However, two days after the election of Francis, Jalics issued a statement confirming the kidnapping and attributing the cause to a former lay colleague who became a guerrilla, was captured, then named Yorio and Jalics when interrogated. The following week, Jalics issued a second, clarifying statement: \"It is wrong to assert that our capture took place at the initiative of Father Bergoglio (\u2026) the fact is, Orlando Yorio and I were not denounced by Father Bergoglio.\"\n\nBergoglio told his authorized biographer, Sergio Rubin, that after the priests' imprisonment, he worked behind the scenes for their release; Bergoglio's intercession with dictator Jorge Rafael Videla on their behalf may have saved their lives. Bergoglio also told Rubin that he had often sheltered people from the dictatorship on church property, and once gave his own identity papers to a man who looked like him, so he could flee Argentina. The interview with Rubin, reflected in the biography El jesuita, is the only time Bergoglio has spoken to the press about those events. Alicia Oliveira, a former Argentine judge, has also reported that Bergoglio helped people flee Argentina during the rule of the junta. Since Francis became pope, Gonzalo Mosca and Jos\u00e9 Caravias have related to journalists accounts of how Bergoglio helped them flee the Argentine dictatorship.\n\nOliveira described the future pope as \"anguished\" and \"very critical of the dictatorship\" during the Dirty War. Oliveira met with him at the time and urged Bergoglio to speak out\u2014he told her that \"he couldn't. That it wasn't an easy thing to do.\" Artist and human rights activist Adolfo P\u00e9rez Esquivel, the 1980 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, said: \"Perhaps he didn't have the courage of other priests, but he never collaborated with the dictatorship. \u2026Bergoglio was no accomplice of the dictatorship.\" Graciela Fern\u00e1ndez Meijide, member of the Permanent Assembly for Human Rights, also said that there was no proof linking Bergoglio with the dictatorship. She told the Clar\u00edn newspaper: \"There is no information and Justice couldn't prove it. I was in the APDH during all the dictatorship years and I received hundreds of testimonies. Bergoglio was never mentioned. It was the same in the CONADEP. Nobody mentioned him as instigator or as anything.\" Ricardo Lorenzetti, President of the Argentine Supreme Court, also has said that Bergoglio is \"completely innocent\" of the accusations. Historian Uki Go\u00f1i pointed that, during early 1976, the military junta still had a good image among society, and that the scale of the political repression was not known until much later; Bergoglio would have had little reason to suspect that the detention of Yorio and Jalics could end up in their deaths.\n\nWhen Bergoglio became pope, an alleged photo of him giving the sacramental bread to dictator Jorge Rafael Videla became popular in social networks. It has also been used by the newspaper P\u00e1gina/12. The photo was soon proved to be false. It was revealed that the priest, whose face is not visible in the photo, was Carlos Ber\u00f3n de Astrada. The photo was taken at the church \"Peque\u00f1a Obra de la Divina Providencia Don Orione\" in 1990, not during the Dirty War, and after Videla's presidential pardon. The photo was produced by the agency AFP and it was initially published by the Cr\u00f3nica newspaper.\n\nFernando de la R\u00faa \nFernando de la R\u00faa replaced Carlos Menem as president of Argentina in 1999. As an archbishop, Bergoglio celebrated the annual Mass at the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral on the First National Government holiday, 25 May. In 2000, Bergoglio criticized the perceived apathy of society. Argentina faced an economic depression at the time, and the Church criticized the fiscal austerity of the government, which increased poverty. De la R\u00faa asked the Church to promote a dialogue between the leaders of economic and political sectors to find a solution for the crisis. He claims that he talked with Bergoglio and proposed to take part in the meeting, but Bergoglio would have told him that the meeting was canceled because of a misunderstanding by De la R\u00faa's assistant, who may have declined the president's assistance. Bishop Jorge Casaretto considers it unlikely, as De la R\u00faa only made the request in newspaper interviews, but never made a formal request to the Church.\n\nThe Justicialist Party won the 2001 elections and got the majority in the Congress, and appointed Ram\u00f3n Puerta as president of the Senate. As vice president Carlos \u00c1lvarez resigned shortly before, this left an opposing party second in the order of precedence. Bergoglio asked for an interview with Puerta, and had a positive impression of him. Puerta told him that the Justicialist party was not plotting to oust De la R\u00faa, and promised to help the president promote the laws that may be required.\n\nDuring police repression of the riots of December 2001, he contacted the Ministry of the Interior and asked that the police distinguish rioters and vandals from peaceful protesters.\n\nN\u00e9stor and Cristina Kirchner \n\nWhen Bergoglio celebrated Mass at the cathedral for the 2004 First National Government holiday, President N\u00e9stor Kirchner attended and heard Bergoglio request more political dialogue, reject intolerance, and criticize exhibitionism and strident announcements. Kirchner celebrated the national day elsewhere the following year and the Mass in the cathedral was suspended. In 2006, Bergoglio helped the fellow Jesuit Joaqu\u00edn Pi\u00f1a to win the elections in the Misiones Province and prevent an amendment of the local constitution that would allow indefinite re-elections. Kirchner intended to use that project to start similar amendments at other provinces, and eventually to the national constitution. Kirchner considered Bergoglio as a political rival to the day he died in October 2010. Bergoglio's relations with Kirchner's widow and successor, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, have been similarly tense. In 2008, Bergoglio called for national reconciliation during disturbances in the country's agricultural regions, which the government interpreted as a support for anti-government demonstrators. The campaign to enact same-sex marriage legislation was a particularly tense period in their relations.\n\nWhen Bergoglio was elected pope, the initial reactions were mixed. Most of the Argentine society cheered it, but the pro-government newspaper P\u00e1gina/12 published renewed allegations about the Dirty War, and the president of the National Library described a global conspiracy theory. The president took more than an hour before congratulating the new pope, and only did so in a passing reference within a routine speech. However, due to the pope's popularity in Argentina, Cristina Kirchner made what the political analyst Claudio Fantini called a \"Copernican shift\" in her relations with him and fully embraced the Francis phenomenon. On the day before his inauguration as pope, Bergoglio, now Francis, had a private meeting with Kirchner. They exchanged gifts and lunched together. This was the new pope's first meeting with a head of state, and there was speculation that the two were mending their relations. P\u00e1gina/12 removed their controversial articles about Bergoglio, written by Horacio Verbitsky, from their web page, as a result of this change.\n\nPapacy (2013\u2013present) \n\nElected at 76 years old, Francis was reported to be healthy and his doctors have said his missing lung tissue, removed in his youth, does not significantly affect his health. The only concern would be decreased respiratory reserve if he had a respiratory infection. In the past, one attack of sciatica in 2007 prevented him from attending a consistory and delayed his return to Argentina for several days. Francis is the first Jesuit pope. This was a significant appointment, because of the sometimes tense relations between the Society of Jesus and the Holy See. However, Bergoglio came in second to Cardinal Ratzinger on all the ballots in the 2005 conclave, and at the time appeared as the only other viable candidate.\nHe is also the first from the Americas, and the first from the Southern Hemisphere. Many media reported him as being the first non-European pope, but he is actually the 11th; the previous was Gregory III from Syria, who died in 741. Moreover, although Francis was not born in Europe, he is ethnically European; his father and both of his mother's parents are from northern Italy.\n\nAs pope, his manner is less formal than that of his immediate predecessors: a style that news coverage has referred to as \"no frills\", noting that it is \"his common touch and accessibility that is proving the greatest inspiration.\" On the night of his election, he took a bus back to his hotel with the cardinals, rather than be driven in the papal car. The next day, he visited Cardinal Jorge Mar\u00eda Mej\u00eda in the hospital and chatted with patients and staff. At his first media audience, the Saturday after his election, the pope explained his papal name choice, citing Saint Francis of Assisi as \"the man who gives us this spirit of peace, the poor man\", and he added \"[h]ow I would like a poor Church, and for the poor\".\n\nIn addition to his native Spanish, he speaks fluent Italian (the official language of Vatican City and the \"everyday language\" of the Holy See) and German. He is also conversant in Latin (the official language of the Holy See), French, Portuguese, and English, and he understands the Piedmontese language and some Genoese.\n\nFrancis chose not to live in the official papal residence in the Apostolic Palace, but to remain in the Vatican guest house, in a suite in which he can receive visitors and hold meetings. He is the first pope since Pope Pius X to live outside the papal apartments. Francis still appears at the window of the Apostolic Palace for the Sunday Angelus.\n\nElection \n\nBergoglio was elected pope on 13 March 2013, the second day of the 2013 papal conclave, taking the papal name Francis. Francis was elected on the fifth ballot of the conclave. The Habemus papam announcement was delivered by the cardinal protodeacon, Jean-Louis Tauran. Cardinal Christoph Sch\u00f6nborn later said that Bergoglio was elected following two supernatural signs, one in the conclave and hence confidential, and a Latin-American couple of friends of Sch\u00f6nborn who whispered Bergoglio's name in Sch\u00f6nborn's ear; Sch\u00f6nborn commented \"if these people say Bergoglio, that's an indication of the Holy Spirit\".\n\nInstead of accepting his cardinals' congratulations while seated on the papal throne, Francis received them standing, reportedly an immediate sign of a changing approach to formalities at the Vatican. During his first appearance as pontiff on the balcony of Saint Peter's Basilica, he wore a white cassock, not the red, ermine-trimmed mozzetta used by previous popes. He also wore the same iron pectoral cross that he had worn as archbishop of Buenos Aires, rather than the gold one worn by his predecessors.\n\nAfter being elected and choosing his name, his first act was bestowing the Urbi et Orbi blessing on thousands of pilgrims gathered in St. Peter's Square. Before blessing the crowd, he asked those in St. Peter's Square to pray for his predecessor, \"the bishop emeritus of Rome\" Pope Benedict XVI, and for himself as the new \"bishop of Rome\".\n\nFrancis held his papal inauguration on 19 March 2013 in St. Peter's Square in the Vatican. He celebrated Mass in the presence of various political and religious leaders from around the world. In his homily Francis focused on the Solemnity of Saint Joseph, the liturgical day on which the Mass was celebrated.\n\nName \n\nAt his first audience on 16 March 2013, Francis told journalists that he had chosen the name in honor of Saint Francis of Assisi, and had done so because he was especially concerned for the well-being of the poor. He explained that, as it was becoming clear during the conclave voting that he would be elected the new bishop of Rome, the Brazilian Cardinal Cl\u00e1udio Hummes had embraced him and whispered, \"Don't forget the poor\", which had made Bergoglio think of the saint. Bergoglio had previously expressed his admiration for St. Francis, explaining that \"He brought to Christianity an idea of poverty against the luxury, pride, vanity of the civil and ecclesiastical powers of the time. He changed history.\"\n\nThis is the first time that a pope has been named Francis. On the day of his election, the Vatican clarified that his official papal name was \"Francis\", not \"Francis I\", i.e. no regnal number is used for him. A Vatican spokesman said that the name would become Francis I if and when there is a Francis II. It is the first time since Lando's 913\u2013914 pontificate that a serving pope holds a name not used by a predecessor.\n\nFrancis also said that some cardinal electors had jokingly suggested to him that he should choose either \"Adrian\", since Adrian VI had been a reformer of the church, or \"Clement\" to settle the score with Clement XIV, who had suppressed the Jesuit order. In February 2014, it was reported that Bergoglio, had he been elected in 2005, would have chosen the pontifical name of \"John XXIV\" in honor of John XXIII. It was said that he told Cardinal Francesco Marchisano: \"John, I would have called myself John, like the Good Pope; I would have been completely inspired by him\".\n\nCuria \n\nOn 16 March 2013, Francis asked all those in senior positions of the Roman Curia to provisionally continue in office. He named Alfred Xuereb as his personal secretary. On 6 April he named Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez Carballo as secretary for the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life, a position that had been vacant for several months. Francis abolished the bonuses paid to Vatican employees upon the election of a new pope, amounting to several million Euros, opting instead to donate the money to charity. He also abolished the \u20ac25,000 annual bonus paid to the cardinals serving on the Board of Supervisors for the Vatican bank.\n\nOn 13 April 2013, he named eight cardinals to a new Council of Cardinal Advisers to advise him on revising the organizational structure of the Roman Curia. The group included several known as critics of Vatican operations and only one member of the Curia. They are Giuseppe Bertello, president of the Vatican City State governorate; Francisco Javier Errazuriz Ossa from Chile; Oswald Gracias from India; Reinhard Marx from Germany; Laurent Monsengwo Pasinya from the Democratic Republic of the Congo; George Pell from Australia; Se\u00e1n O'Malley from the United States; and \u00d3scar Andr\u00e9s Rodr\u00edguez Maradiaga from Honduras. He appointed Bishop Marcello Semeraro secretary for the group and scheduled its first meeting for 1\u20133 October.\n\nEarly issues \nIn March 2013, 21 British Catholic peers and members of Parliament from all parties asked Francis to allow married men in Great Britain to be ordained as priests, keeping celibacy as the rule for bishops. They asked it on the grounds that it would be anomalous that married Anglican priests can be received into the Catholic Church and ordained as priests, by means of either the Pastoral Provision of 20 June 1980 or the 2009 Anglican ordinariate, but married Catholic men cannot do the same.\n\nFouad Twal, the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, included a call in his 2013 Easter homily for the pope to visit Jerusalem. Louis Raphael I, the Chaldean Catholic Patriarch, asked the pope to visit the \"embattled Christian community\" in Iraq. In March 2021, Pope Francis went to Iraq on a first-ever papal visit to the diminishing Christian communities of Mesopotamia fallen apart after years of conflict.\n\nOn the first Holy Thursday following his election, Francis washed and kissed the feet of ten male and two female juvenile offenders, not all Catholic, aged from 14 to 21, imprisoned at Rome's Casal del Marmo detention facility, telling them the ritual of foot washing is a sign that he is at their service. This was the first time that a pope had included women in this ritual; although he had already done so when he was archbishop. One of the male and one of the female prisoners were Muslim.\n\nOn 31 March 2013, Francis used his first Easter homily to make a plea for peace throughout the world, specifically mentioning the Middle East, Africa, and North and South Korea. He also spoke out against those who give in to \"easy gain\" in a world filled with greed, and made a plea for humanity to become a better guardian of creation by protecting the environment. He said that \"[w]e ask the risen Jesus, who turns death into life, to change hatred into love, vengeance into forgiveness, war into peace.\" Although the Vatican had prepared greetings in 65 languages, Francis chose not to read them. According to the Vatican, the pope \"at least for now, feels at ease using Italian, the everyday language of the Holy See\".\n\nIn 2013, Francis initially reaffirmed the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith's program to reform the U.S. Leadership Conference of Women Religious, initiated under his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI. The New York Times reported that the Vatican had formed the opinion in 2012 that the sisters' group was tinged with feminist influences, focused too much on ending social and economic injustice and not enough on stopping abortion, and permitted speakers at its meetings who questioned church doctrine. However, in April 2015 the investigation was brought to a close. While the timing of the closure may have anticipated a visit by Francis to the U.S. in September 2015, it was noted that the sisters' emphasis is close to that of Francis.\n\nOn 12 May, Francis carried out his first canonizations of candidates approved for sainthood during the reign of Benedict XVI: the first Colombian saint, Laura of Saint Catherine of Siena, the second female Mexican saint, Mar\u00eda Guadalupe Garc\u00eda Zavala, both of the 20th century, and the 813 15th-century Martyrs of Otranto. He said: \"While we venerate the martyrs of Otranto, ask God to support the many Christians who still suffer from violence and give them the courage and fate and respond to evil with goodness.\"\n\nSynodal church \n\nFrancis has overseen synods on the family (2014), on youth (2018), and on the Church in the Amazon region (2019). In 2019 Francis' apostolic constitution Episcopalis communio allowed that the final document of a synod may become magisterial teaching simply with papal approval. The constitution also allowed for laity to contribute input directly to the synod's secretary general. Some analysts see the creation of a truly synodal church as likely to become the greatest contribution of Francis' papacy.\n\nConsultation with Catholic laity \n\nA February 2014 survey by the World Values Survey cited in The Washington Post and Time shows how the unity Francis had created could be challenged. Although views about Francis personally were favorable, many Catholics disagreed with at least some of his teachings. The survey found that members of the Catholic Church are deeply divided over abortion, artificial contraception, divorce, the ordination of women, and married priests. In the same month Francis asked parishes to provide answers to an official questionnaire described as a \"much broader consultation than just a survey\" regarding opinions among the laity. He continued to assert Catholic doctrine, in less dramatic tone than his recent predecessors, who maintained that the Catholic Church is not a democracy of popular opinion.\n\nLinda Woodhead of Lancaster University wrote of the survey Francis initiated, \"it's not a survey in any sense that a social scientist would recognize.\" Woodhead said that many ordinary Catholics would have difficulty understanding theological jargon there. Nonetheless, she suspected the survey might be influential.\n\nThe Catholic Church in England and Wales  had refused to publish results of this survey; a Church spokesman said a senior Vatican official had expressly asked for summaries to remain confidential, and that orders had come from the pope that the information should not be made public until after October. This disappointed many reformers who hoped the laity would be more involved in decision-making. Some other Catholic churches, for example in Germany and Austria, published summaries of the responses to the survey, which showed a wide gap between Church teaching and the behavior of ordinary Catholics.\n\nIn a column he wrote for the Vatican's semi-official newspaper L'Osservatore Romano, the then-Prefect of the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura, American cardinal Raymond Leo Burke, who has a long-standing reputation as one of the church's most vocal conservative hard-liners, said that Francis opposed both abortion and gay marriage. The Vatican's chief spokesman, Father Federico Lombardi, also noted in the Vatican press office during the 2014 consistory meetings that Francis and Cardinal Walter Kasper would not change or redefine any dogmas pertaining to Church theology on doctrinal matters.\n\nInstitute for the Works of Religion \nIn the first months of Francis's papacy, the Institute for the Works of Religion, informally known as the Vatican Bank, said that it would become more transparent in its financial dealings There had long been allegations of corruption and money laundering connected with the bank. Francis appointed a commission to advise him about reform of the Bank, and the finance consulting firm Promontory Financial Group was assigned to carry out a comprehensive investigation of all customer contacts of the bank on these facts. Because of this affair the Promoter of Justice at the Vatican Tribunal applied a letter rogatory for the first time in the history of the Republic of Italy at the beginning of August 2013. In January 2014, Francis replaced four of the five cardinal overseers of the Vatican Bank, who had been confirmed in their positions in the final days of Benedict XVI's papacy. Lay experts and clerics were looking into how the bank was run. Ernst von Freyberg was put in charge. Moneyval feels more reform is needed, and Francis may be willing to close the bank if the reforms prove too difficult. There is uncertainty how far reforms can succeed.\n\nPapal documents \nOn 29 June 2013, Francis published the encyclical Lumen fidei, which was largely the work of Benedict XVI but awaiting a final draft at his retirement. On 24 November 2013, Francis published his first major letter as pope, the apostolic exhortation Evangelii gaudium, which he described as the programmatic of his papacy. On 18 June 2015, he published his first own, original encyclical Laudato si' concerning care for the planet. On 8 April 2016, Francis published his second apostolic exhortation, Amoris laetitia, remarking on love within the family. Controversy arose at the end of 2016 when four cardinals formally asked Francis for clarifications, particularly on the issue of giving communion to divorced and civilly remarried Catholics.\n\nHis motu proprios include Ai nostri tempi and De concordia inter codices. Francis issued another titled Maiorem hac dilectionem which created a new path towards canonization for certain causes.\n\nHe established two new Secretariats (top-level departments) in the Roman Curia: the Secretariat for the Economy, and the Secretariat for Communications. He simplified the process for declaring matrimonial nullity.\n\nOn 8 December 2017, Francis signed a new apostolic constitution on ecclesiastical universities and faculties Veritatis gaudium, published 29 January 2018.\n\nA further Apostolic Exhortation, Gaudete et exsultate (Rejoice and be glad), was published on 19 March 2018, dealing with \"the call to holiness in today's world\" for all persons. He counters contemporary versions of the gnostic and Pelagian heresies and describes how Jesus' beatitudes call people to \"go against the flow\".\n\nIn February 2019, Francis acknowledged that priests and bishops were sexually abusing religious sisters. He addressed this and the clergy sex abuse scandal by convening a summit on clergy sexual abuse in Rome 21\u201324 February 2019. As a follow-up to that summit, on 9 May 2019 Francis promulgated the motu proprio Vos estis lux mundi which specified responsibilities, including reporting directly to the Holy See on bishops and on one's superior, while simultaneously involving another bishop in the archdiocese of the accused bishop.\n\nOn 30 September 2020, he published the apostolic letter Scripturae sacrae affectus to celebrate the 16th centenary of the death of Jerome.\n\nOn 4 October 2020 on the feast of St. Francis of Assisi, Francis published the encyclical Fratelli tutti on fraternity and social friendship, using St. Francis' own words to describe our universal brotherhood and sisterhood.\n\nOn 8 December 2020 on the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, Pope Francis published the apostolic letter Patris corde (\"With a Father's Heart\"). To mark the occasion, the Pope proclaimed a \"Year of Saint Joseph\" from 8 December 2020, to 8 December 2021 on the 150th Anniversary of the Proclamation of Saint Joseph as Patron of the Universal Church.\n\nOn 1 June 2021, Francis published the apostolic constitution Pascite gregem Dei.\n\nPope Francis issued the motu proprio Traditionis custodes on 16 July 2021. The document abrogated the permissions for the celebration of the Tridentine Mass previously established by Benedict XVI in the 2007 Summorum Pontificum, with Traditionis custodes instituting increased restrictions on the use of the 1962 Roman Missal. Pope Francis stated in a letter accompanying the motu proprio that emphasizing the Mass of Paul VI would bring \"unity I intend to re-establish throughout the Church of the Roman Rite.\"\n\nEcumenism and interreligious dialogue \n\nPope Francis continued in the tradition of the Second Vatican Council and of the papacies since the Council in promoting ecumenism with other Christian denominations, as well as encouraging dialogue with leaders of other religions; he has also supported peace with those claiming no religious belief.\n\nClerical titles \n\nIn January 2014, Francis said that he would appoint fewer monsignors and only assign those honored to the lowest of the three surviving ranks of monsignor, chaplain of His Holiness. It would be awarded only to diocesan priests at least 65 years old. During his 15 years as archbishop of Buenos Aires, Francis never sought the title for any of his priests. It is believed he associates it with clerical careerism and hierarchy, though he did not apply this restriction to clergy working in the Roman Curia or diplomatic corps, where careerism is an even greater concern.\n\nCanonizations and beatifications \n\nFrancis presided over the first canonizations of his pontificate on 12 May 2013 in which he canonized the Martyrs of Otranto. Antonio Primaldo and his 812 companions who had been executed by the Ottomans in 1480, as well as the religious sisters Laura of St. Catherine of Siena and Mar\u00eda Guadalupe Garc\u00eda Zavala \u2013 in this first canonization he surpassed the record of Pope John Paul II in canonizing the most saints in a pontificate. Francis approved the equipollent canonization of Angela of Foligno the following 9 October and then the Jesuit Peter Faber the following 17 December.\n\nThe pope approved further equipollent canonizations on 3 April 2014 for the Jesuit Jos\u00e9 de Anchieta as well as the Ursuline nun Marie of the Incarnation and bishop Fran\u00e7ois de Laval. Francis canonized his two predecessors John XXIII and John Paul II on 27 April 2014 and canonized six additional saints the following 23 November. The pope canonized Joseph Vaz on his visit to Sri Lanka on 14 January 2015 and canonized a further four saints on the following 17 May; he canonized Jun\u00edpero Serra on 23 September while visiting the United States and then canonized four saints on 18 October including the first married couple to be named as saints. Francis canonized Maria Elisabeth Hesselblad and Stanislaus Papczy\u0144ski on 5 June 2016 and then canonized Teresa of Calcutta on 4 September; he canonized seven additional saints on 16 October. The pope canonized the two child visionaries Francisco and Jacinta Marto during his visit to F\u00e1tima in mid-2017 and canonized 35 additional saints on 15 October. Francis recognized seven saints on 14 October 2018, chief among them, his predecessor Pope Paul VI and \u00d3scar Romero. Francis later confirmed the equipollent canonization for Bartholomew of Braga in mid-2019. On 13 October 2019, Francis canonized five new saints, including Cardinal John Henry Newman. The pope confirmed the equipollent canonization for Margherita della Metola on 24 April 2021.\n\nThe pope has also continued the practice of having beatifications celebrated in the place of the individual's origin though has presided over beatifications himself on three occasions: for Paul Yun Ji-Chung and 123 companions on 16 August 2014, his predecessor Pope Paul VI on 19 October 2014, and two Colombian martyrs on 8 September 2017. The pope has approved beatifications for a range of men and women including the likes of \u00c1lvaro del Portillo of Opus Dei (27 September 2014), the martyred archbishop \u00d3scar Romero (23 May 2015), the prominent Polish cardinal Stefan Wyszy\u0144ski (12 September 2021), and several large groups of Spanish martyrs.\n\nFrancis also confirmed his predecessor John Paul I to be Venerable on 8 November 2017.\n\nDoctors of the Church \nOn 21 February 2015, Francis signed a decree naming Saint Gregory of Narek as the 36th Doctor of the Church; he formally conferred the title upon the saint at a ceremony held in Saint Peter's Basilica on 12 April 2015 with delegations from the Armenian Catholic Church and the Armenian Apostolic Church present. On 20 January 2022, Francis provided his approval to the suggestion to name Saint Irenaeus of Lyon as the 37th Doctor of the Church, formally conferring the title upon him, along with the supplementary title Doctor unitatis (\"Doctor of Unity\") in a decree issued on 21 January.\n\nConsistories \n\nAt the first consistory of his papacy, held on 22 February 2014, Francis created 19 new cardinals. At the time of their elevation to that rank, 16 of these new cardinals were under eighty years of age and thus eligible to vote in a papal conclave. The new appointees included prelates from South America, Africa, and Asia, including appointees in some of the world's poorest countries, such as Chibly Langlois from Haiti and Philippe Nakellentuba Ouedraogo from Burkina Faso. The consistory was a rare occasion in which Francis and his predecessor, Benedict XVI, appeared together in public.\n\nBenedict XVI also attended the second consistory on 14 February 2015, at which Francis elevated 20 new cardinals, with 15 under the age of eighty and five over the age of eighty. The pope continued his practice of appointing cardinals from the peripheries, such as Charles Maung Bo of Myanmar and Soane Patita Paini Mafi of Tonga.\n\nFrancis presided over the third consistory of his papacy on 19 November 2016, elevating 17 new cardinals. Of that total number at the time of their elevation, 13 were under the age of eighty and four were over the age of eighty. Francis continued his previous practice of elevating cardinals from the peripheries with an emphasis again on Asia and Africa, such as Patrick D'Rozario from Bangladesh and Dieudonn\u00e9 Nzapalainga from the Central African Republic, while also naming the first three American cardinals of his papacy and only one Curial appointment.\n\nThe pope presided over a fourth consistory for the elevation of five new cardinals on the afternoon of 28 June 2017. Each of the five were under the age of eighty, and were thus eligible to vote in a papal conclave. This consistory was noteworthy for the fact that, with the pope continuing the trend of elevating cardinals from a diverse range of areas, no cardinals elevated are of the Roman Curia, and one was a mere auxiliary bishop.\n\nFrancis presided over his fifth consistory for the elevation of 14 new cardinals on 28 June 2018. The first eleven were under the age of eighty, and therefore, were eligible to vote in a future papal conclave while the last three were over the age of eighty, and thus, ineligible to vote in a papal conclave. The pope continued the practice of naming the Vicar of Rome and a curial prefect as cardinals, while naming his substitute for the Secretariat of State in anticipation of his transferral to a curial department. The pope also continued his practice of bestowing the red hat on those from peripheries such as Madagascar, Pakistan, and Iraq, and like in 2016, created a priest as a cardinal. The consistory was also noteworthy for the fact that Francis named the papal almoner Konrad Krajewski as a cardinal, marking the consistory the first occasion where the almoner was made a cardinal. Francis himself later said that he wanted the office of almoner to receive the red hat going forward as it was an important arm of the Vatican.\n\nOn 1 September 2019, following his weekly Sunday Angelus address, Francis unexpectedly announced the appointment of 13 new cardinals. Of these, 10 appointees were under the age of 80 and would therefore become cardinal electors, besides three over 80. The new cardinals were formally installed at the consistory celebrated on 5 October 2019. Most of the new cardinals come from the peripheries of the church and developing countries. Two new appointees were from Muslim majority countries (Morocco and Indonesia), while two others were known for their work on refugee and migration issues. This action took the number of cardinal electors appointed by Francis to the College of Cardinals to about 70 out of nearly 130.\n\nFrancis created thirteen new cardinals on 28 November 2020; nine appointees were under the age of 80, therefore, could vote in a future papal conclave. The pope also nominated four cardinals over the age of 80. Most of these new appointees continued the trend that Francis adhered to, appointing the first cardinals to represent Brunei and Rwanda. Francis also nominated the first African American cardinal (Gregory), while naming the first Conventual Franciscan (Gambetti) in almost 160 years, and the first from Siena (Lojudice) since 1801. Three of his appointees were only priests upon their nomination, therefore, two (Gambetti and Feroci) received their episcopal consecration, while one (Cantalamessa) was granted a papal dispensation from it.\n\nYear of Mercy \n\nWith his April 2015 papal bull of indiction, Misericordiae Vultus (Latin: \"The Face of Mercy\"), Francis inaugurated a Special Jubilee Year of Mercy, to run from 8 December 2015, Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary, to the last Sunday before Advent and the Solemnity of the Feast of Christ the King of the Universe on 20 November 2016.\n\nThe Holy Doors of the major basilicas of Rome (including the Great Door of St. Peter's) were opened, and special \"Doors of Mercy\" were opened at cathedrals and other major churches around the world, where the faithful can earn indulgences by fulfilling the usual conditions of prayer for the pope's intentions, confession, and detachment from sin, and communion. During Lent of that year, special 24-hour penance services will be celebrated, and during the year, special qualified and experienced priests called \"Missionaries of Mercy\" will be available in every diocese to forgive even severe, special-case sins normally reserved to the Holy See's Apostolic Penitentiary.\n\nFrancis established the World Day of the Poor in his Apostolic Letter, Misericordia et Misera, issued on 20 November 2016 to celebrate the end of the Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy.\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic \n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Francis canceled his regular general audiences at St. Peter's Square to prevent crowds from gathering and spreading the virus, which seriously affected Italy. He encouraged priests to visit patients and health workers; urged the faithful not to forget the poor during the time of crisis; offered prayers for victims of the virus in China; and invoked the Blessed Virgin Mary under her title Salus Populi Romani, as the Diocese of Rome observed a period of prayer and fasting in recognition of the victims. The pontiff reacted with displeasure on 13 March 2020, at the news that the Vicar General had closed all churches in the Diocese of Rome. Despite Italy being under a quarantine lockdown, Francis pleaded \"not to leave the ... people alone\" and worked to partially reverse the closures.\n\nOn 20 March 2020, Francis asked the Dicastery for Promoting Integral Human Development (DPIHD) to create a Vatican COVID-19 Commission to express the Church's concern for the crisis generated by the COVID-19 pandemic, and propose responses to the potential socio-economic challenges deriving from it.\n\nOn 27 March, Francis gave an extraordinary benediction Urbi et Orbi. In his homily on calming the storm in the Gospel of Mark, Francis described the setting: \"Dense darkness has thickened on our squares, streets and cities; it looks over our lives filling everything with a deafening silence and a desolate void that paralyzes everything in its passage: you can feel it in the air, you can feel it in your gestures. ...In the face of suffering, where the true development of our peoples is measured, we discover and experience the priestly prayer of Jesus: 'may all be one'.\"\n\nFrancis maintains getting COVID vaccination is a moral obligation.  Francis stated that people had a responsibility to look after themselves, \u201cand this translates into respect for the health of those around us. Health care is a moral obligation\u201d, he stated.<ref>Pope Francis has said getting vaccinated against coronavirus is a \u201cmoral obligation\u201d and denounced how naysayers had been swayed by \u201cbaseless information\u201d. The Guardian;;</ref>\n\n Russo-Ukrainian War \nFollowing the February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War, Francis visited the Russian embassy in Rome in what was described as an \"unprecedented move.\" Francis called Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, stating his \"sorrow\" as the Vatican worked to find \"room for negotiation.\" As the invasion began, the major archbishop of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church Sviatoslav Shevchuk cancelled a trip to visit Francis in Florence. On 25 February, the day after the invasion began, Francis would assure Shevchuk via a phone call that \"he would do everything he can to help end the Ukraine conflict.\" During the 27 February Angelus address, Francis called for peace, saying, \"Silence the weapons!\"\n\n Role of women \n\nOn 11 January 2021, Francis allowed bishops to institute women to the ministries of acolyte and lector. While these instituted ministries were previously reserved to men, Catholic women already carry out these duties without institution in most of the world. Francis wrote that these ministries are fundamentally distinct from those reserved to ordained clergy.\n\nIn February 2021, Francis announced back-to-back appointments of women to take positions that were only held by men in the past. He appointed France\u2019s member of the Xaviere Missionary Sisters, Nathalie Becquart as the first co-undersecretary of the Synod of Bishops. Besides, an Italian magistrate, Catia Summaria also became the first woman Promoter of Justice in the Vatican\u2019s Court of Appeals.\n\n Financial corruption \nFrancis was mandated by electing cardinals to sort out Vatican finances following scandals during the papacies of Pope Benedict and Pope John Paul II.  He stated he is determined to end corruption in the Catholic Church but is not very optimistic due to a human problem dating back centuries.\n\n Theological emphases \n\nIn Evangelii gaudium Francis revealed what would be the emphases of his pontificate: a missionary impulse among all Catholics, sharing the faith more actively, avoiding worldliness and more visibly living the gospel of God's mercy, and helping the poor and working for social justice.\n\n Evangelization \n\nFrom his first major letter Evangelii gaudium (Joy to the World), Francis called for \"a missionary and pastoral conversion\" whereby the laity would fully share in the missionary task of the church. Then in his letter on the call of all to the same holiness, Gaudete et exsultate, Fancis describes holiness as \"an impulse to evangelize and to leave a mark in this world\".\n\n Church governance \n\nFrancis called for decentralization of governance away from Rome, and for a synodal manner of decision making in dialogue with the people. He strongly opposed clericalism and made women full members of the Church's dicasteries in Rome.\n\n Environment \nFrancis' naming of himself after Francis of Assisi was an early indication of how he shared Francis' care for all of creation. This was followed in May 2015 with his major encyclical on the environment, Laudato si' (Praise be to you).\n\n Option for the poor \n\nFrancis has highly extolled \"popular movements\", which demonstrate the \"strength of us\", serve as a remedy to the \"culture of the self\", and are based on solidarity with the poor and the common good.\n\n Morality \nCardinal Walter Kasper has called mercy \"the key word of his pontificate.\" His papal motto Miserando atque eligendo (\"by having mercy and by choosing\") contains a central theme of his papacy, God's mercy, While maintaining the Church's traditional teaching against abortion, Francis, has referred to the \"obsession\" of some Catholics with a few issues like \"abortion, gay marriage and the use of contraceptive methods\" which \"do not show the heart of the message of Jesus Christ.\u201d\n\n LGBT \n\nIn June 2013, Francis suggested that \"if a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge?\" Later, in 2015, he declared that \"the family is threatened by growing efforts on the part of some to redefine the very institution of marriage.\" He has also suggested that same-sex marriage \"disfigures God's plan for creation.\"\n\nHe stated that he supports legally recognising same-sex civil unions in a statement from an interview published in October 2020; this passage was from an interview from 2019, but this passage had been cut from public releases at the time. The statement was also interpreted as supportive of LGBT adoption.What we have to create is a civil union law. That way they are legally covered. They're children of God and have a right to a family. Nobody should be thrown out or be made miserable because of it.\nHowever, Vatican later clarified that his comments were taken out of context with two comments to two different questions at different times spliced together in a very misleading way. Francis has never officially pronounced support for gay civil unions. Francis also endorsed the 2015 Slovak same-sex marriage referendum which would have banned same-sex adoptions in the country.\n\nIn January 2022, Francis said during a weekly audience that parents of gay children should offer support to their children instead of condemning them.\n\n Religious persecution \n\nFrancis supported the use of force to stop Islamic militants from attacking religious minorities in Iraq. In January 2018, Francis met with a group of Yazidi refugees in Europe and expressed his support for their right to freely profess their own faith without limitations. In the meeting, he also urged the international community \"not to remain a silent and unresponsive spectator in the face of [your] tragedy.\"\n\n Controversies \nSince 2016, criticism against Francis by theological conservatives has intensified. One commentator has described the conservative resistance against Francis as \"unique in its visibility\" in recent Church history. Some have explained the level of disagreement as due to his going beyond theoretical principles to pastoral discernment.\n\n Sexual abuse response \n\nAs cardinal, in 2010 Bergoglio commissioned a study which concluded that Father Julio Grassi, a priest convicted of child sexual abuse, was innocent, that his victims were lying, and that the case against him never should have gone to trial. Despite the study, the Supreme Court of Argentina upheld the conviction and 15-year prison sentence against Grassi in March 2017. Francis has admitted that the Church \"arrived late\" in dealing with sexual abuse cases. During his papacy, a number of abuse survivors have expressed disappointment in Francis's response to sex abuse in the Church while others have praised him for his actions.\n\nIn 2015, Francis was criticized for supporting Chilean bishop Juan Barros, who was accused of covering up sex crimes committed against minors. In 2018, Francis acknowledged he had made \"grave errors\" in judgment about Barros, apologized to the victims and launched a Vatican investigation that resulted in the resignation of Barros and two other Chilean bishops. In 2018, Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigan\u00f2 published an open letter denouncing Francis's handling of sexual abuse allegations against Theodore McCarrick, accusing him of knowing about allegations that McCarrick had committed sexual abuse and failing to take action. Vigan\u00f2 called on the Pope to resign.\n\nIn November 2021, Francis thanked journalists for their \"mission\" on uncovering sex abuse scandals in the Church, adding that it made of the cases \"less obscure (...) to make those who live it less fear it.\"\n\n Theological disagreements \n Amoris laetitia and the communion to the divorced and civilly remarried \n\nOn a theological level, controversy arose after the publication of the apostolic exhortation Amoris laetitia, especially regarding whether the exhortation had changed the Catholic Church's sacramental discipline concerning access to the sacraments of Penance and the Eucharist for divorced couples who have civilly remarried. Francis had written that \"It is important that the divorced who have entered a new union should be made to feel part of the Church.\" He called not for \"a new set of general rules, canonical in nature and applicable to all cases,\" but \"a responsible personal and pastoral discernment of particular cases.\" He went on to say: \u201cIt is true that general rules set forth a good which can never be disregarded or neglected, but in their formulation they cannot provide absolutely for all particular situations.\u201d\n\nFour cardinals (Raymond Leo Burke, Carlo Caffarra, Walter Brandm\u00fcller, and Joachim Meisner) formally asked Francis for clarifications, particularly on the issue of giving communion to divorced and civilly remarried Catholics. They submitted five \"dubia\" (doubts), and requested a yes or no answer. Francis has not publicly replied. The exhortation has been implemented in different ways by various bishops around the world.\n\nCardinal Gerhard M\u00fcller, former prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, maintained that Amoris Laetitia should only be interpreted in line with previous doctrine. Therefore, according to Cardinal M\u00fcller, divorced and civilly remarried can have access to the Sacraments of Reconciliation and the Eucharist only if they take on the duty of living in complete continence. Francis subsequently announced that dicastery prefects would be appointed for a single five-year term, and replaced M\u00fcller at the end of his term in 2017 with Luis Ladaria Ferrer. Cardinal Carlo Caffarra, one of the authors of the dubia, maintains that after Amoris laetitia \"only a blind man could deny there's great confusion, uncertainty and insecurity in the Church.\"\n\nIn July 2017 a group of conservative clergy, academics and laymen signed a document labeled as a \"Filial Correction\" of Francis. The 25-page document, which was made public in September after it received no reply, criticized the pope for promoting what it described as seven heretical propositions through various words, actions and omissions during his pontificate. Capuchin Father Thomas Weinandy, ex-doctrine chief of US Bishops, wrote a letter to Francis on 31 July 2017, which he subsequently made public, in which he charged that Francis is fostering \"chronic confusion\", \"demeaning\" the importance of doctrine, appointing bishops who \"scandalize\" believers with dubious \"teaching and pastoral practice\", giving prelates who object the impression they will be \"marginalized or worse\" if they speak out, and causing faithful Catholics to \"lose confidence in their supreme shepherd\".\n\n Document on Human Fraternity \n\nThe Document on Human Fraternity for World Peace and Living Together is a joint statement signed by Francis and Sheikh Ahmed el-Tayeb, Grand Imam of Al-Azhar, on 4 February 2019 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. This joint statement is concerned with how different faiths can live peaceably in the same world and areas. Criticisms focused particularly on the passage about God's will with regard to the diversity of religions, claiming that the \"pluralism and the diversity of religions, colour, sex, race and language are willed by God in His wisdom, through which He created human beings\". Catholic theologian Chad Pecknold wrote that this sentence was \"puzzling, and potentially problematic\". Some Catholic observers tried to understand it as an allusion to the \"permissive will\" of God, allowing evil on earth. Pecknold wrote that the diversity of religions might also be \"evidence of our natural desire to know God\". On 8 February 2019 Bishop Athanasius Schneider released a document entitled \"The Gift of Filial Adoption, the Christian Faith: the only valid and the only God-willed religion\".\n\n Traditionis custodes and the restriction of the Tridentine Mass \n\nIn July 2021, Francis issued, motu proprio, the apostolic letter titled Traditionis custodes, which reversed the decision of his immediate predecessor Benedict XVI in Summorum Pontificum and imposed new restrictions on the use of the Traditional Latin Mass. The letter returned to the bishops the power to grant or suppress the Latin Mass in their particular dioceses, and requires newly ordained priests to first request permission before performing the old rite, among other changes. \"Traditionis Custodes, which Pope Francis published and came into immediate effect on July 16, has been criticized by prelates such as Cardinals Raymond Burke, Gerhard M\u00fcller and Joseph Zen, as well as many lay faithful who attend the traditional Latin Mass, also called Extraordinary Form of the Roman Rite. The most general criticism is that the restrictions are unnecessary, needlessly harsh, and implemented in an unjustifiably swift fashion.\"\n\n International policy \n\nFrancis has regularly been accused by conservatives of having a \"soft spot\" for leftist populist movements. After Francis's visit to Cuba in 2015, Catholic Yale historian Carlos Eire said Francis had a \"preferential option for the oppressors\" in Cuba. Nevertheless, Francis remained hostile to right-wing populism.\n\nFrancis has supported the Vatican-China agreement, intended to normalize the situation of China's Catholics, which was criticized by Cardinal Joseph Zen as a step towards the \"annihilation\" of the Catholic Church in China. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said cooperating with the Chinese Communist Party puts the pope's moral authority at risk. In September 2020, Pompeo urged Francis to stand against China's human rights violations. In November, Francis named China's Uyghur minority among a list of the world's persecuted peoples. He wrote: \"I think often of persecuted peoples: the Rohingya [Muslims in Myanmar], the poor Uighurs, the Yazidi\u2014what ISIS did to them was truly cruel\u2014or Christians in Egypt and Pakistan killed by bombs that went off while they prayed in church.\" Zhao Lijian, the spokesman of the Foreign Ministry of China, said Francis\u2019 remarks had \"no factual basis at all\".\n\nSince 2016, Francis has also been contrasted with US President Donald Trump, elected that year, with some conservative critics drawing comparisons between the two. During the 2016 United States presidential election, Francis said of Trump, \"A person who only thinks about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian. That is not the gospel.\" Trump responded, \"For a religious leader to question a person's faith is disgraceful.\" Federico Lombardi said that Francis' comments were not \"a personal attack, nor an indication of who to vote for\".\n\nIn response to criticism from Venezuela's bishops, President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro said in 2017 that he had the support of Francis. Francis met with the country's bishops in June 2017, and the Venezuelan bishops' conference president stated, \"There is no distance between the episcopal conference and the Holy See.\" In January 2019, 20 former presidents in Latin America wrote a letter to Francis criticizing his Christmas address regarding the ongoing Venezuelan crisis for being too simplistic and for not acknowledging what they believed to be the causes of the suffering of the victims of the crisis. Francis has sought peace in the crisis without picking a side.\n\nIn 2019, during the Hong Kong protests, Francis was criticized by Catholic clergy in Hong Kong, with Cardinal Joseph Zen criticizing him for not taking a stand against China and instead being quoted as saying \"I would like to go to China. I love China\". Francis compared the protests in Hong Kong to those seen in Chile and in France.\n\nFollowing the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan and withdrawal of U.S. forces from the country, Francis said that the withdrawal of troops was \"legitimate\" but said that the process of evacuations was \"not thought through\" and criticized the war for having failed at nation-building. He also stated that the Vatican is in talks with the Taliban through Cardinal Pietro Parolin to discourage the Taliban on taking reprisal measures against civilians.\n\n International diplomatic role \n\nFrancis played a key role in the talks toward restoring full diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Cuba. The restoration was jointly announced by U.S. President Barack Obama and Cuban President Ra\u00fal Castro on 17 December 2014. The headline in the Los Angeles Times on 19 December was \"Bridge to Cuba via Vatican,\" with the further lead \"In a rare and crucial role, Francis helped keep U.S. talks with Havana on track and guided final deal.\" The pope, along with the Government of Canada, was a behind-the-scenes broker of the agreement, taking the role following President Obama's request during his visit to the pope in March 2014. The success of the negotiations was credited to Francis because \"as a religious leader with the confidence of both sides, he was able to convince the Obama and Castro administrations that the other side would live up to the deal\". En route to the United States for a visit in September 2015, the pope stopped in Cuba. \"The plan comes amid a breakthrough for which Francis has received much credit.\" The Cuba visit \"seals that accomplishment, in which he served as a bridge between two erstwhile enemies\". According to one expert on religion in Latin America, Mario Paredes, the pope's visit to Cuba was consistent with his aim to promote an understanding of the role of the Cuban Revolution and that of the Catholic Church. When Francis was archbishop of Buenos Aires, he authored a text entitled \"Dialogues Between John Paul II and Fidel Castro\". John Paul was the first pope to visit Cuba. In May 2015, Francis met with Cuban leader Ra\u00fal Castro. After the meeting in Vatican City on 10 May 2015, Castro said that he was considering returning to the Catholic Church. He said in a televised news conference, \"I read all the speeches of the pope, his commentaries, and if the pope continues this way, I will go back to praying and go back to the [Catholic] church. I am not joking.\" Castro said that, when the pope came, \"I promise to go to all his Masses and with satisfaction\".\n\nIn May 2014, his visit to the State of Israel, where he delivered 13 speeches, was heavily publicized. Protests against his visit resulted in an alleged arson attempt at the Dormition Abbey. The cave under the Church of the Nativity caught fire the night after his visit.\n\nIn May 2015, Francis welcomed Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas to the Vatican. Several media outlets reported that Francis praised Abbas as \"an angel of peace\", though his actual words were the following: \"The angel of peace destroys the evil spirit of war. I thought about you: may you be an angel of peace.\" The Vatican signed a treaty recognizing the state of Palestine. The Vatican issued statements concerning the hope that the peace talks could resume between Israel and Palestine. Abbas' visit was on the occasion of the canonization of two Palestinian nuns.\n\nOn 6 June 2015, Francis visited Sarajevo, the capital city of Bosnia and Herzegovina. He urged peace during his time in the religiously diverse city, known as the \"Jerusalem of Europe\".\n\nOn 25 September 2015, Francis addressed the United Nations in New York City.\n\nOn 16 April 2016, he visited, together with Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew and Archbishop Ieronimos II of Athens, the Moria Refugee Camp on the Greek island of Lesbos, to call the attention of the world to the refugee issue. There the three Christian leaders signed a joint declaration.\n\nIn January 2017, Francis demanded the resignation of Matthew Festing, the 79th Prince and Grand Master of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. The Pope's demand came as a response to Festing and Cardinal Raymond Leo Burke firing Baron Albrecht von Boeselager from his position in the Order of Malta. The Order, in May 2017, appointed a new leader in the person of Fra' Giacomo Dalla Torre del Tempio di Sanguinetto.\n\nOn 24 May 2017, Francis met with U.S. President Donald Trump in Vatican City, where they discussed the contributions of Catholics to the United States and to the world. They discussed issues of mutual concern, including how religious communities can combat human suffering in crisis regions, such as Syria, Libya, and ISIS-controlled territory. They also discussed terrorism and the radicalization of young people. The Vatican's secretary of state, Pietro Parolin, raised the issue of climate change and encouraged Trump to remain in the Paris Agreement. At the 2017 World Food Day ceremony, Francis reiterated that \"we see the consequences [of climate change] every day\" and that we \"know how the problems are to be faced ... [t]hanks to scientific knowledge.\" He said that \"the international community has drawn up the necessary legal instruments, such as the Paris Agreement, from which however some are withdrawing. There is a re-emergence of the nonchalance towards the delicate balances of ecosystems, the presumption of being able to manipulate and control the planet's limited resources, and greed for profit.\"\n\nFrancis visited Ireland in 2018, in what was the first papal tour of the country since John Paul II's historic trip in 1979. While in Ireland he apologized for abuses by clergy in the United States and Ireland.\n\nIn February 2019, Francis visited Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, on the invitation of Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Francis became the first pope to hold a papal Mass on the Arabian Peninsula, with more than 120,000 attendees in the Zayed Sports City Stadium.\n\nFrancis made the plight of refugees and migrants \"a core component of his pastoral work\", and has defended their rights in dialogue both with Europe and with the United States. He went on to place a statue in St. Peter's Square to bring attention to the Christian imperative involved in their situation (Hebrews 13:2).\n\nIn March 2021, Pope Francis held a historic meeting with Iraq's top Shi'ite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, and visited the birthplace of the Prophet Abraham, Ur. Giving a message of peaceful coexistence, he and the Iraqi cleric urged the Muslim and Christian communities to work together in unity for peace.\n\nOn 9 May 2021, Francis called for peace between Israel and Palestinians and an end to clashes in Jerusalem during his Regina caeli address.\n\nOn 1 September 2021, Francis publicly defended the dialogue with China on the appointment of new bishops. Francis stated that uneasy dialogue was better than no dialogue at all, and emphasized in improving strained ties with the Chinese government.\n\nOn All Souls' Day, on 1 November 2021, Francis visited a war cemetery in Rome and paid tribute to fallen soldiers during the Battle of Anzio in World War II as well as at the Piave River, in Italy, during World War I. Francis also praised military casualties for \"fighting for their homeland and values.\" and called for global peace.\n\n Public image \n\nPopular mainstream media frequently portray Francis either as a progressive papal reformer or with liberal, moderate values. The Vatican has claimed that Western news outlets often seek to portray his message with a less-doctrinal tone of papacy, in hopes of extrapolating his words to convey a more merciful and tolerant message. In the news media, both faithful and non-believers often refer to a \"honeymoon\" phase in which the pope has changed the tone on Catholic doctrines and supposedly initiated ecclesiastical reform in the Vatican. Media systems differ, too, not only in their coverage of Francis's stances but also in how individual events are portrayed. His 2015 trip to Cuba is a prime example. During this trip, American-based AP and British-based Reuters highlighted the religious aspect of the pope's journey while Prensa Latina, the official state media agency, depicted it as a diplomatic visit. American and British media were also more likely during this trip to show Francis interacting with regular Cubans compared to the official Cuban media, which showed Francis interacting with elites most often.\n\nIn December 2013, both Time and The Advocate magazines named the Pontiff as their \"Person of the Year\" in praise and hopes of reforming the Roman Curia while hoping to change the Catholic Church's doctrine on various controversial issues. In addition, Esquire magazine named him as the \"Best-dressed man\" for 2013 for his simpler vestments often in tune with a modern simplistic design on sartorial fashion. Rolling Stone magazine followed in January 2014 by making the Pontiff their featured front cover. Fortune magazine also ranked Francis as number one in their list of 50 greatest leaders. On 5 November 2014, he was ranked by Forbes as the fourth most powerful person in the world and was the only non-political figure in the top ranking. In December 2016, Francis again made Forbess list of \"The World's Most Powerful People\", ranking fifth.\n\nIn March 2013, a new song was dedicated to Francis and released in Brazilian Portuguese, European Portuguese, and Italian, titled Come Puoi (\"How You Can\"). Also in March, Pablo Buera, the mayor of La Plata, Argentina, announced that the city had renamed a section of a street leading up to a local cathedral Papa Francisco. There are already efforts to name other streets after him, as well as a school where he studied as a child. A proposal to create a commemorative coin as a tribute to Francis was made in Argentina's lower house on 28 November 2013. On the coins it would read, \"Tribute from the Argentine People to Pope Francis.\" beneath his face. As of May 2013, sales of papal souvenirs, a sign of popularity, were up.\n\nFrancis presided over his first joint public wedding ceremony in a Nuptial Mass for 20 couples from the Archdiocese of Rome on 14 September 2014, just a few weeks before the start of the 5\u201319 October Extraordinary Synod of Bishops on the Family.\n\nOn 19 March 2016, Francis became the first pope to create an Instagram account. He broke records after having gained over one million followers in under twelve hours of the account being up. In 2019 Francis held a conference on the World Day of Social Communications highlighting the pros and cons of social media and urging users to use it as a source that liberates rather than enslaves. On 26 November 2020 Francis became the first pope to write an op-ed for The New York Times, addressing issues such as the coronavirus and the need for global solidarity. The Pontiff also used his op-ed to strongly critique those protesting COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nIn August 2021, rumors of a possible resignation arose due to health issues, but he dismissed those rumors in early September 2021, saying that he is \"living a normal life.\"\n\n Distinctions \n\n Titles and styles \nThe official form of address of the pope in English is His Holiness Pope Francis; in Latin, Franciscus, Episcopus Romae. Holy Father is among the other honorifics used for popes.\n\n Foreign orders \n : : Grand Collar of the Order of the Condor of the Andes (9 July 2015)\n : Order of Merit \"Father Luis Espinal Camps\" (9 July 2015)\n : : Order of the Smile (26 April 2016)\n\n Awards \n : International Charlemagne Prize of Aachen 2016.\n \"Person of the Year\" by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (2015) for his request that all Catholics be kind to animals.\nWas made an honorary Harlem Globetrotter on 7 May 2015.\nZayed Award for Human Fraternity in October 2020 for significant contributions to the service of humanity from around the world.\n\n Academic honors \n Honorary Sommelier Diploma of the Italian Sommelier Association (2015).\n\n Honorific eponyms and dedications \n\n : The Pope Francis Center for the Poor \u2013 Palo, Leyte (12 July 2015)\n Ennio Morricone composed a Mass setting (Missa Papae Francisci) named after the pope, for the occasion of the 200th anniversary of the restoration of the Jesuit order.

First performance: Capella Mariana 4 October 2015.\n\n Appreciation \nIn the oratorio Laudato si' by Peter Reulein (music) written on a libretto by Helmut Schlegel OFM, the figure of Francis appears next to Mary, Francis of Assisi, and Clare of Assisi. In the oratorio, Pope Franziskus suggests a bridge from the crucifixion scene on Golgotha to the suffering of the present. He emphasizes the female talent and the importance of the charism of women for church and society. The texts of the encyclicals Laudato si' and Evangelii gaudium were used. The motto of the Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy also plays a central role. The oratorio was premiered on 6 November 2016 in the Limburg Cathedral.\n\n Coat of arms \n\n Writings \n\nPope Francis has written a variety of books, encyclicals, and other writings.\n\n Music album Wake Up! was released on 27 November 2015 by the label Believe Digital and contains speeches by Francis and accompanying music, including rock music.\n\n Films \n Documentary film \nBy 2015, there were two biographical films about Francis: Call Me Francesco (Italy, 2015), starring Rodrigo de la Serna, and Francis: Pray for me (Argentina, 2015), starring Dar\u00edo Grandinetti.Pope Francis: A Man of His Word is a documentary film with Swiss-Italian-French-German co-production, co-written and directed by Wim Wenders.

He is the first Pope from the Americas and the first Pope to choose the name Francis upon election. Born Jorge Mario Bergoglio on December 17, 1936, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, he was the eldest of five children. He entered the Jesuit novitiate in 1958 and was ordained a priest in 1969. In 1998, Pope John Paul II appointed him Archbishop of Buenos Aires, and he was later made a Cardinal in 2001. Pope Francis is known for his humble and down-to-earth approach to leadership and his dedication to serving the poor. He has become a symbol for reform within the Catholic Church, pushing for greater openness, transparency, and inclusivity. In particular, he has been a vocal advocate for the rights of marginalized communities, such as immigrants and refugees, and has spoken out against social and economic inequality. Under Pope Francis's leadership, the Catholic Church has taken steps towards addressing some of its historical controversies, including allegations of sexual abuse by clergy. He has introduced new measures aimed at preventing future abuse and held bishops accountable for their handling of abuse cases. Pope Francis has also been a prominent voice on global issues, such as climate change and nuclear disarmament. He has repeatedly called on world leaders to take action to address these issues, and has even published an encyclical on the environment, which called for urgent action to protect the planet. Overall, Pope Francis's tenure as Pope has been marked by a commitment to social justice and a desire to reform the Catholic Church. He has shown a willingness to challenge traditional hierarchies and put the needs of the poor and marginalized first. His impact on the Catholic Church and the wider world has been significant, and his leadership continues to inspire and influence people around the globe.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1687680}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Matt Wozniak\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Matt Wozniak (born January 6, 1983) is a Canadian curler from Winnipeg, Manitoba. He currently plays second on Team Jason Gunnlaugson. Wozniak is the former second for the Mike McEwen team which curled out of the Assiniboine Memorial Curling Club in Winnipeg.\n\nCareer\n\n2005\u20132010\nIn 2005, Wozniak joined the new Mike McEwen rink that included Justin Richter and Andrew Melnuk. For the 2006-07 season, Richter and Melnuk left the team and were replaced with Geordie Hargreaves and Adam Guenther. The team disbanded after just one season together.\n\nWozniak and McEwen joined with brothers Denni and B. J. Neufeld in 2007. In their first season together, they were a semi-finalist at the 2008 Safeway Championship, Manitoba's provincial championship. Their first Grand Slam event as a team was at the end season, at the 2008 Players' Championships. The team won two games, before being eliminated.\n\nAt the conclusion of the 2008-09 season the McEwen team was ranked 7th on the CCA rankings. They had made it to three Grand Slam playoffs, and finished 4th at the 2009 Safeway Championship.\n\nDuring the 'Road to the Roar' 2009 Olympic Qualifier, the McEwen team just lost out to fellow Manitobans the Jason Gunnlaugson team in the semi-finals. Team McEwen thus missed out on the 2009 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials final despite being the favourite in that particular matchup vs Gunnlaugson.\n\nMcEwen's rink made it to his first provincial final in 2010, when he lost to Jeff Stoughton in the 2010 Manitoba provincial final. The game was being played in Steinbach, Manitoba and as the Neufeld brothers and their father have roots in Steinbach, were treated very much as the home team and crowd favourites.\n\n2010-2015: Grand Slam success and perennial provincial runner-up\nTeam McEwen started the 2010-11 season off well by defeating provincial rival Jeff Stoughton to win the World Cup of Curling and his first ever Grand Slam title in November, 2010. In part of the teams runner-up result in the provincial finals of 2010 and in part because of his 4 victories and leading the overall money winnings in the World Curling Tour season as of November 2010, the McEwen team was named as a nominee for the provincial team of the year by the Manitoba Sportswriters and Sportscasters Association.\n\nThe team continued their strong season that year by defeating provincial rival Stoughton in the semi-final of the 2011 Canadian Open. They would then go on to beat the Glenn Howard team in the extra end of the final, thus winning their second career Grand Slam and their second of that season.\n\nWozniak's rink once again made it to the Manitoba provincial this time, being the top seed (also ranked 1st in Canada). However, once again lost to Stoughton in the final of the 2011 Safeway Championship, losing by one point in the final end. The McEwen team then lost their third straight provincial final game at the 2012 Safeway Championship, this time losing to Rob Fowler, thus tying a provincial record for consecutive final losses previous set by Kerry Burtnyk from 97-99. This dubious record was avoided in 2013, when the McEwen rink failed to reach the final, but again losing to the rival Stoughton rink in the 2013 Safeway Championship semi-final. Once again, at the 2014 Safeway Championship, the team lost the final to Stoughton.\n\nDespite being ranked first in the world on both the World Curling Tour Order of Merit rankings and on the WCT money list, Wozniak lost his fifth provincial final in six years in 2015, losing to Reid Carruthers.\n\nThree Briers and team breakup \nWozniak's rink won their first provincial title in 2016, sending them to their first Brier. The Matt Dunstone rink had committed themselves to the 2016 World Junior Curling Championships, which occurred at the same time as the 2016 Tim Hortons Brier, so when the Dunstone rink beat Reid Carruthers in the semi-final, McEwen's team would go to the Brier, even if they had lost to Dunstone.\n\nIn 2017, Wozniak defended his Manitoba Championship by beating Reid Carruthers in the final. He would then better his 2016 Brier showing, going 9\u20132 in the round robin to enter the playoffs in first place and with hammer and choice of rocks (Brad Gushue was also 9\u20132 but lost first place due to losing his round robin meeting with Manitoba). He then lost 7\u20135 to Brad Gushue in the 1 vs. 2 game. In the semi finals against reigning Brier and World Champion Kevin Koe, they were in control for most of the game, being up 5\u20133 with hammer in the eighth end, but Koe made a comeback with a steal in the eighth end, two points in the tenth end, and another steal in the extra end, dropping Manitoba to the bronze medal game. They recovered to win their first Brier medal, defeating Brad Jacobs in their rematch of the 2016 bronze medal game, 7\u20136 in an extra end.\n\nWhile competing at the 2018 Viterra Championship, skip McEwen came down with chickenpox and was unable to play after the first game. B. J. Neufeld skipped the team, until a surprise appearance by McEwen in the final, where they lost to Carruthers. Despite the setback, they still had a chance to qualify for the 2018 Tim Hortons Brier through the wildcard game, which they won over Jason Gunnlaugson. Team McEwen had a difficult Brier and alongside Carruthers was unable to qualify for the playoffs. Following the Brier, the McEwen team announced they would be breaking up at the end of the 2017\u201318 season. Just days after the announcement, the McEwen team won the 2018 Elite 10 Grand Slam of Curling event, winning the top $28,000 prize money, and was the first team to go through the entire event undefeated. The Grand Slam victory was the team's seventh overall.\n\nWozniak took a few years off from men's play after Team McEwen broke up. However, he played mixed doubles with his current girlfriend Marlene Albrecht and spared for McEwen's new team. After Alex Forrest stepped away from competitive curling after the 2019\u201320 season, Wozniak joined the Jason Gunnlaugson rink. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Manitoba, the 2021 provincial championship was cancelled.

It was later revived by American metalsmith Margret Craver, who encountered the technique in 1953 and spent 13 years re-creating and perfecting it.\n\nMethod\nThe technique involves etching a design in a piece of glass, which is then lined with gold foil and the hollow filled with powdered enamel. It is difficult to accomplish in part because of the extremely careful regulation of temperature required to fuse the enamel without damaging the glass in which it is embedded. The edges of the foil form a frame for the enamel, giving the appearance, as artist William Claude Harper described it, of \"the most delicate cloisonn\u00e9 that you can imagine\".\n\n1950s rediscovery\nIn 1953, metalsmith Margret Craver saw a pin decorated using the technique.  Craver began studying the technique, researching and testing it over the course of about thirteen years to reproduce it.  Because the technique was not being practiced, and there were no instructional texts in existence, the work was slow, and Craver had to design her own tools.

It lives chiefly in shady woodlands, and grows up to  tall, producing a cluster of up to 18 pale blue flowers in spring. It was formally described in 1996, having previously been identified as belonging to the related species H.\u00a0italica.\n\nDescription\nHyacinthoides paivae is a perennial plant which grows from bulbs that are typically  \u00d7 . Each bulb produces 4\u20137 (more rarely 2\u201312) basal leaves, each  long and  wide. The stems are  long, and bear an inflorescence comprising 6\u201318 flowers in a multilateral raceme. Each flower is attached by a pedicel  long, and is itself  long by  wide. H.\u00a0paivae can be told apart from H.\u00a0italica by its broader leaves and larger flowers; H.\u00a0hispanica differs in having longer, narrower, unscented and bell-shaped flowers.\n\nDistribution and ecology\nHyacinthoides paivae is endemic to the north-western part of the Iberian Peninsula, including western parts of Galicia (A Coru\u00f1a, Ourense and Pontevedra provinces) and north-western parts of Portugal (Beira Litoral, Douro Litoral, Minho and Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes provinces). Material of an unidentified species from the Sierra de la Demanda, a small mountain range on the border between Burgos province and La Rioja, matches H.\u00a0paivae genetically.\n\nH.\u00a0paivae occurs in oak woodland and pine woods growing over Ulex, Erica cinerea and Cistus spp., as well as other shady habitats. It also occurs occasionally on coastal cliffs, and in mown meadows. The typical flowering period is March and April, although it can be as late as June in upland areas, such as Monte Pindo.\n\nTaxonomic history\nIn 1990, bluebells assigned to the species Hyacinthoides italica were reported from north-western Spain. Later analyses of the species morphology demonstrated that the plants did not belong to H.\u00a0italica, which is only otherwise found near the French\u2013Italian border. Instead, it was realised that they represented a new species, which was named Hyacinthoides paivae by Santiago Ortiz and Juan Rodr\u00edguez-Oubi\u00f1a in 1996, the specific epithet  honouring the Portuguese botanist Jorge Paiva.\n\nThe holotype, a specimen from Dumbr\u00eda, A Coru\u00f1a province, Spain, is held at the herbarium of the ; isotypes are also kept there, and at the University of Coimbra, the  and  in Madrid, the  in Pontevedra, and at the Natural History Museum and Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in London.\n\nOrtiz and Rodr\u00edguez-Oubi\u00f1a initially placed the species in \"Hyacinthoides sect.

The Paiva's hyacinth grows from a bulb with a diameter of 1 to 2 cm. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, reaching up to 30 cm in length, with a green color and a glossy appearance. The flowers grow in compact clusters or racemes, with up to 12 flowers per stem. The flowers are bell-shaped with six petals, which are pale to deep blue in color. They bloom in late spring to early summer and are known to attract bees. Hyacinthoides paivae is similar in appearance to the better-known English bluebell (Hyacinthoides non-scripta) but can be distinguished by its smaller size, narrower leaves, and paler blue flowers. It has been classified as a separate species from the English bluebell based on molecular and morphological analyses. The Paiva's hyacinth is considered a rare and endangered species, with a fragmented distribution in Portugal. It is threatened by habitat destruction due to urbanization, agriculture, and riverbank erosion. In 1994, it was listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List.

Moreover, if the primal problem has an optimal solution, then the dual problem also has an optimal solution, and the optimal values of the two problems are equal. The theorem has significant implications for the efficient solution of both primal and dual linear programming problems. It provides a theoretical foundation for understanding the relationship between the primal and dual problems and enables the development of algorithms for solving these problems. The primal problem involves maximizing or minimizing an objective function subject to a set of constraints expressed as linear equations or inequalities. The dual problem is created by introducing a set of variables associated with the constraints of the primal problem. The objective function of the dual problem is to minimize or maximize a function subject to the constraints. The FTLP is used in various fields, including economics, finance, transportation, and computer science. It provides a powerful tool for optimizing various business and industrial processes and optimizing resource allocation. In summary, the fundamental theorem of linear programming is a powerful tool used to optimize various business and industrial processes. It is an essential result in linear programming, providing a theoretical foundation for understanding the relationship between the primal and dual problems and enabling the development of algorithms for solving these problems.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 25844292}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Solar (novel)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Solar is a novel by author Ian McEwan, first published on 18 March 2010 by Jonathan Cape, an imprint of Random House. It is a satire about a jaded Nobel-winning physicist whose dysfunctional personal life and cynical ambition see him pursuing a solar-energy based solution for climate change.\n\nPlot summary\nMichael Beard is an eminent, Nobel Prize\u2013winning physicist whose own life is chaotic and complicated. The novel takes the reader chronologically through three significant periods in Beard's life: 2000, 2005 and 2009, interspersed with some recollections of his student days in Oxford.\n\n2000\nMiddle-aged, balding and slightly overweight womanizer Beard falls into a depression after learning that his fifth wife, Patrice, has begun an affair with their builder, a man called Tarpin. Despite being a Nobel award-winning physicist Beard realizes all his best work was done as a young man and now coasts on his reputation heading a research centre in Reading that seeks to harness wind energy. One of the younger researchers at the centre, Tom Aldous, tries to speak to Beard about the potential of solar energy but Beard shuts him down.\n\nAfter seeing Patrice with a bruise on her face Beard goes to confront Tarpin, but finds himself no match for the man and leaves after causing a scene in front of Tarpin's neighbours. Depressed over his marriage Beard accepts an invitation to go to the Arctic as part of a retreat on climate change. While there he realizes he is the only scientist among groups of artists who believe passionately in climate change (which he remains skeptical of) though they treat him with respect, believing his research in wind-based energy constitutes concrete steps towards combatting global warming.\n\nBeard returns home from his trip deciding to divorce Patrice. Arriving early however he encounters Tom Aldous in his bathrobe. After Beard tells him he will ruin his career Aldous begs him not to imploring him that his research into photosynthesis and solar energy is more important than the feud between the two of them. While pleading for his career Aldous trips on a rug and strikes his head against a coffee table. Beard realizes that if he calls the police he could be blamed for Aldous's death and instead plants evidence of Tarpin's presence.\n\nTarpin is indeed arrested and convicted of Aldous's murder and Beard is painted in the media as a sympathetic figure who had been cuckolded by his wife. Aldous's research on solar energy is given to Beard as it had been labelled with his name.\n\n2005\nBy 2005, Beard is experiencing a career resurgence due to his research into solar energy which in actuality was the research of Tom Aldous. Beard no longer works for the government having been fired after giving a press conference in which he stated that the lack of women in science was due to the natural limitations of their gender. The ensuing anger into his comments caused a media storm and resulted in his womanizing past being scrutinized in the press.\n\nHe has a sexual relationship with a younger woman named Melissa who owns a string of dance supply shops whom he deliberately refuses to marry despite her desire for a child. Returning home from a trip Melissa informs Beard that she is currently pregnant having stopped taking birth control pills. Beard is angry and tries to think of ways to convince Melissa to have an abortion.\n\n2009\nBeard is now a father, and sixty-two years old. He is not in the best of health, and is worried about a suspicious-looking lesion on his wrist. His solar power plant is in the final stages of construction in Lordsburg, New Mexico, where he has acquired another girlfriend, Darlene, a waitress. Darlene wants to marry him, but he has a very comfortable set-up with Melissa and his three-year-old daughter, Catriona. All his problems culminate on the eve of the opening ceremony for his solar power plant. Tarpin is out of jail and turns up looking for work, Melissa flies to New Mexico with his daughter to try and win him over from Darlene, a patent lawyer arrives with proof that he stole his ideas from the now-dead Aldous, his doctor confirms the lesion on his hand is cancerous, his business partner abandons him to multimillion-dollar debts, and then he learns that somebody (presumably Tarpin) has sabotaged his power plant by smashing the solar panels. In the final scene Beard gets an \"unfamiliar, swelling sensation\" in his heart which he interprets as love for his daughter, but may well be the onset of a heart attack.\n\nBackground\nThe novel is primarily a work of fiction but draws heavily on references to real science and modern history.\n\nMichael Beard's trip to the Norwegian Arctic island of Spitsbergen is based on a 2005 trip McEwan made with art and climate change organisation, Cape Farewell. The group of artists and scientists that McEwan travelled with included Antony Gormley and Rachel Whiteread.  He later said of the trip:\n\nReception\nIn 2010, Solar was awarded the Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse Prize, a British literary award for comic writing.\n\nExternal links\nReview by RealClimate\nReview by Publishers Weekly\nAudiobook review by Publishers Weekly\n Review by The Independent\nReview by The Guardian\nReview by The Telegraph\nReview by Time (magazine)\n Ian McEwan presents \"Solar\" in Barcelona, Canal-L\n\nReferences\n\n2010 British novels\nNovels by Ian McEwan\nNovels set in the Arctic\nJonathan Cape books\nNovels set in Berkshire\nFiction set in 2000\nFiction set in 2005\nFiction set in 2009\nNovels set in New Mexico\nClimate change novels", "machine_text": "Solar is a novel written by British author Ian McEwan and published in 2010. The novel tells the story of Michael Beard, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist who is grappling with his personal and professional life. The protagonist, Michael Beard, is an aging and overweight physicist who is struggling with his failing marriage, his lustful tendencies, and his research project on solar energy. The novel is set in 2000 against the backdrop of climate change and the growing awareness of the need for sustainable energy sources. The narrative is divided into five parts, each focusing on a pivotal moment in Beard's life. The opening scene depicts Beard at a climate conference in New Mexico, where he steals a colleague's paper and delivers it as his own. The theft catapults Beard into a series of events, including a visit to the Arctic to study the melting ice caps, a disastrous affair with a younger woman, and a murder plot that threatens to ruin his reputation. McEwan's writing is marked by his trademark wit, satire, and sharp observation. The novel's tone is a mix of dark humor and social commentary. The author uses Beard's character to address themes such as climate change, the role of scientists in society, and the destructive impact of human behavior on the environment. The novel received mixed reviews upon its publication, with some critics praising McEwan's writing style and the novel's relevance to contemporary issues, while others criticized its plot and character development. Nevertheless, Solar was shortlisted for the 2010 Booker Prize, solidifying McEwan's reputation as one of Britain's foremost contemporary writers. In conclusion, Solar is a thought-provoking novel that tackles pertinent issues surrounding climate change and sustainable energy. McEwan's character-driven narrative and humorous tone make this novel an engaging read that sheds light on the complexities of modern life and the urgent need for collective action to combat environmental degradation.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 26518872}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Maurice Maeterlinck\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Maurice Polydore Marie Bernard Maeterlinck (29 August 1862 \u2013 6 May 1949), also known as Count (or Comte) Maeterlinck from 1932, was a Belgian playwright, poet, and essayist who was Flemish but wrote in French. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1911 \"in appreciation of his many-sided literary activities, and especially of his dramatic works, which are distinguished by a wealth of imagination and by a poetic fancy, which reveals, sometimes in the guise of a fairy tale, a deep inspiration, while in a mysterious way they appeal to the readers' own feelings and stimulate their imaginations\". The main themes in his work are death and the meaning of life. He was a leading member of La Jeune Belgique group and his plays form an important part of the Symbolist movement. In later life, Maeterlinck faced credible accusations of plagiarism.\n\nBiography\n\nEarly life\nMaeterlinck was born in Ghent, Belgium, to a wealthy, French-speaking family. His mother, Mathilde Colette Fran\u00e7oise (n\u00e9e Van den Bossche), came from a wealthy family. His father, Polydore, was a notary who enjoyed tending the greenhouses on their property.\n\nIn September 1874 he was sent to the Jesuit College of Sainte-Barbe, where works of the French Romantics were scorned and only plays on religious subjects were permitted. His experiences at this school influenced his distaste for the Catholic Church and organized religion. One of his companions at that time was the writer Charles van Lerberghe, the poems and plays of whom went on to act as mutual influences on each other at the start of the Symbolist period.\n\nMaeterlinck had written poems and short novels while still studying, but his father wanted him to go into law. After gaining a law degree at the University of Ghent in 1885, he spent a few months in Paris, France. He met members of the new Symbolist movement; Villiers de l'Isle Adam in particular, who would have a great influence on Maeterlinck's subsequent work.\n\nCareer\n\nMaeterlinck instantly became a public figure when his first play, Princess Maleine, received enthusiastic praise from Octave Mirbeau, the literary critic of Le Figaro, in August 1890. In the following years he wrote a series of symbolist plays characterized by fatalism and mysticism, most importantly Intruder (1890), The Blind (1890) and Pell\u00e9as and M\u00e9lisande (1892).\n\nHe had a relationship with the singer and actress Georgette Leblanc from 1895 until 1918. Leblanc influenced his work for the following two decades. With the play Aglavaine and S\u00e9lysette (1896) Maeterlinck began to create characters, especially female characters, who were more in control of their destinies. Leblanc performed these female characters on stage. Even though mysticism and metaphysics influenced his work throughout his career, Maeterlinck slowly replaced his Symbolism with a more existential style.\n\nIn 1895, with his parents frowning upon his open relationship with an actress, Maeterlinck and Leblanc moved to the district of Passy in Paris. The Catholic Church was unwilling to grant her a divorce from her Spanish husband. The couple frequently entertained guests, including Mirbeau, Jean Lorrain, and Paul Fort. They spent their summers in Normandy. During this period, Maeterlinck published his Twelve Songs (1896), The Treasure of the Humble (1896), The Life of the Bee (1901), and Ariadne and Bluebeard (1902).\n\nIn 1903 Maeterlinck received the Triennial Prize for Dramatic Literature from the Belgian government. During this period, and up until the Great War of 1914-1918, he was widely looked up to, throughout Europe, as a great sage, and the embodiment of the higher thought of the time.\n\nIn 1906 Maeterlinck and Leblanc moved to a villa in Grasse in the south of France. He spent his hours meditating and walking. As he emotionally pulled away from Leblanc, he entered a state of depression. Diagnosed with neurasthenia, he rented the  Benedictine Abbey of St. Wandrille in Normandy to help him relax. By renting the abbey he rescued it from the desecration of being sold and used as a chemical factory and thus he received a blessing from the Pope. Leblanc would often walk around in the garb of an abbess; he would wear roller skates as he moved about the house. During this time, he wrote his essay \"The Intelligence of Flowers\" (1906), in which he expressed sympathy with socialist ideas. He donated money to many workers' unions and socialist groups. At this time he conceived his greatest contemporary success: the fairy play  The Blue Bird (1908, but largely written in 1906). After the writing \"The Intelligence of Flowers\", he suffered from a period of depression and writer's block. Although he recovered from this after a year or two, he never became so inventive as a writer again. His later plays, such as Marie-Victoire (1907) and  Mary Magdalene (1910), provided with lead roles for Leblanc, were notably inferior to their predecessors, and sometimes merely repeat an earlier formula. Even though alfresco performances of some of his plays at St. Wandrille had been successful, Maeterlinck felt that he was losing his privacy. The death of his mother on 11 June 1910 added to his depression.\n\nIn 1910 he met the 18-year-old actress Ren\u00e9e Dahon during a rehearsal of The Blue Bird. She became his lighthearted companion. After having been nominated by Carl Bildt, a member of the Swedish Academy, he received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1911, which also served to lighten his spirits. By 1913 he had become more openly socialist and sided with the Belgian trade unions against the Catholic party during a strike. He began to study mysticism and lambasted the Catholic Church in his essays for misconstruing the history of the universe. By a decree of 26 January 1914, the Roman Catholic Church placed his opera omnia on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum.\n\nWhen Germany invaded Belgium in 1914, Maeterlinck wished to join the French Foreign Legion, but his application was denied due to his age. He and Leblanc decided to leave Grasse for a villa near Nice, where he spent the next decade of his life. He gave speeches on the bravery of the Belgian people and placed the blame upon all Germans for the war. Although his patriotism and his indifference to the harm he was doing to his standing in Germany do him credit, his reputation as a great sage who stood above current affairs was damaged by his political involvement. \nWhile in Nice he wrote The Mayor of Stilmonde (1918), which the American press quickly labeled a \"Great War Play\", and which became a British film in 1929. He also wrote The Betrothal (, 1922), a sequel to The Blue Bird, in which the heroine of the play is clearly not a Leblanc archetype.\n\nOn 15 February 1919 Maeterlinck married Dahon. He accepted an invitation to the United States, where Samuel Goldwyn asked him to produce a few scenarios for film. Only two of Maeterlinck's submissions still exist; Goldwyn didn't use any of them. Maeterlinck had prepared one based on his The Life of the Bee. After reading the first few pages Goldwyn burst out of his office, exclaiming: \"My God! The hero is a bee!\"\n\nAfter 1920 Maeterlinck ceased to contribute significantly to the theatre, but continued to produce essays on his favourite themes of occultism, ethics and natural history. The international demand for these fell off sharply after the early 1920s, but his sales in France remained substantial until the late 1930s. Dahon gave birth to a stillborn child in 1925.\n\nPlagiarism\nIn 1926 Maeterlinck published La Vie des Termites (translated into English as The Life of Termites or The Life of  White Ants), an entomological book that plagiarised the book The Soul of the (White) Ant, by the Afrikaner poet and scientist Eug\u00e8ne Marais, David Bignell, in his inaugural address as Professor of Zoology at the University of London (2003), called Maeterlinck's work \"a classic example of academic plagiarism\".\nMarais accused Maeterlinck of having appropriated Marais' concept of the \"organic unity\" of the termite nest in his book. Marais had published his ideas on termite nests in the South African Afrikaans-language press, in Die Burger (January 1923) and in Huisgenoot, which featured a series of articles on termites under the title \"Die Siel van die Mier\" (The Soul of the (White) Ant) from 1925 to 1926. Maeterlinck's book, with almost identical content, was published in 1926. It is conjectured that Maeterlinck had come across Marais' articles while writing his book, and that it would have been easy for him to translate Afrikaans into French, since Maeterlinck knew Dutch and had already made several translations from Dutch into French.  It was common at the time, moreover, for worthy articles published in Afrikaans to be reproduced in Flemish and Dutch magazines and journals.\n\nMarais wrote in a letter to Dr. Winifred de Kock in London about Maeterlinck that\n\nThe famous author had paid me the left-handed compliment of cribbing the most important part of my work ... He clearly desired his readers to infer that he had arrived at certain of my theories (the result of ten years of hard labour in the veld) by his own unaided reason, although he admits that he never saw a termite in his life. You must understand that it was not merely plagiarism of the spirit of a thing, so to speak. He has copied page after page verbally.\n\nSupported by a coterie of Afrikaner Nationalist friends, Marais sought justice through the South African press and attempted an international lawsuit. This was to prove financially impossible and the case was not pursued. All the same, he gained a measure of renown as the aggrieved party and as an Afrikaner researcher who had opened himself up to plagiarism because he published in Afrikaans out of nationalistic loyalty. Marais brooded at the time of the scandal: \"I wonder whether Maeterlinck blushes when he reads such things [critical acclaim], and whether he gives a thought to the injustice he does to the unknown Boer worker?\"\n\nMaeterlinck's own words in The Life of Termites indicate that the possible discovery or accusation of plagiarism worried him:\n\nIt would have been easy, in regard to every statement, to allow the text to bristle with footnotes and references. In some chapters there is not a sentence but would have clamoured for these; and the letterpress would have been swallowed up by vast masses of comment, like one of those dreadful books we hated so much at school. There is a short bibliography at the end of the volume which will no doubt serve the same purpose.\n\nWhatever Maeterlinck's misgivings at the time of writing, the bibliography he refers to does not include Eug\u00e8ne Marais. \n\nProfessor V. E. d'Assonville referred to Maeterlinck as \"the Nobel Prize winner who had never seen a termite in his whole life and had never put a foot on the soil of Africa, least of all in the Waterberg\".\n\nRobert Ardrey, an admirer of Eug\u00e8ne Marais, attributed Marais' later suicide to this act of plagiarism and theft of intellectual property by Maeterlinck, although Marais' biographer, Leon Rousseau, suggested that Marais had enjoyed and even thrived on the controversy the attention it generated.\n\nAnother allegation of plagiarism concerned Maeterlinck's play Monna Vanna, which was said to have been based on Robert Browning's little-known play Luria.\n\nLater life\nIn 1930 he bought a ch\u00e2teau in Nice, France, and named it Orlamonde, a name occurring in his work Quinze Chansons.\n\nHe was made a count by Albert I, King of the Belgians in 1932.\n\nAccording to an article published in the New York Times in 1940, he arrived in the United States from Lisbon on the Greek Liner Nea Hellas. He had fled to Lisbon in order to escape the Nazi invasion of both Belgium and France. While in Portugal, he stayed in Monte Estoril, at the Grande Hotel, between 27 July and 17 August 1939. The Times quoted him as saying, \"I knew that if I was captured by the Germans I would be shot at once, since I have always been counted as an enemy of Germany because of my play, The Mayor of Stilmonde, which dealt with the conditions in Belgium during the German Occupation of 1918.\" As with his earlier visit to America, he still found Americans too casual, friendly and Francophilic for his taste.\n\nHe returned to Nice after the war on 10 August 1947. He was President of PEN International, the worldwide association of writers, from 1947 until 1949. In 1948, the French Academy awarded him the Medal for the French Language. He died in Nice on 6 May 1949 after suffering a heart attack.\n\nHonours \n 1920: Grand Cordon of the Order of Leopold.\n 1932: Created Count Maeterlinck, by Royal Decree. However, he neglected fulfilling the necessary paper work for registration and the creation was not implemented.\n\nStatic drama\n\nMaeterlinck's posthumous reputation depends entirely on his early plays (published between 1889 and 1894), which created a new style of dialogue, extremely lean and spare, where what is suggested is more important than what is said. The characters have no foresight, and only a limited understanding of themselves or the world around them. That the characters stumble into tragedy without realizing where they are going may suggest that Maeterlinck thought of man as powerless against the forces of fate, but the kinship is not with ancient Greek tragedy but with modern dramatists such as Beckett and Pinter who bring out human vulnerability in a world beyond our comprehension.  \n\nMaeterlinck believed that any actor, due to the hindrance of physical mannerisms and expressions, would inadequately portray the symbolic figures of his plays. He concluded that marionettes were an excellent alternative. Guided by strings operated by a puppeteer, Maeterlinck considered marionettes an excellent representation of fate's complete control over man. He wrote Interior, The Death of Tintagiles, and Alladine and Palomides for marionette theatre.\n\nFrom this, he gradually developed his notion of the \"static drama.\" He felt that it was the artist's responsibility to create something that did not express human emotions but rather the external forces that compel people. Maeterlinck once wrote that \"the stage is a place where works of art are extinguished. ... Poems die when living people get into them.\"\n\nHe explained his ideas on the static drama in his essay \"The Tragic in Daily Life\" (1896), which appeared in The Treasure of the Humble. The actors were to speak and move as if pushed and pulled by an external force, fate as puppeteer. They were not to allow the stress of their inner emotions to compel their movements. Maeterlinck would often continue to refer to his cast of characters as \"marionettes.\"\n\nMaeterlinck's conception of modern tragedy rejects the intrigue and vivid external action of traditional drama in favour of a dramatisation of different aspects of life:\n\nHe cites a number of classical Athenian tragedies\u2014which, he argues, are almost motionless and which diminish psychological action to pursue an interest in \"the individual, face to face with the universe\"\u2014as precedents for his conception of static drama; these include most of the works of Aeschylus and Sophocles' Ajax, Antigone, Oedipus at Colonus, and Philoctetes.

Although he is mainly known as a playwright, his impact on literature was far-ranging and his works spanned many genres including poetry, short stories, essays and criticism. Maeterlinck was born in Ghent, Belgium, but grew up in a countryside castle in Flanders. He began his career as a lawyer, but soon turned to writing, publishing his first collection of poems in 1889, titled Serres chaudes. His first play, Princess Maleine, was performed the following year to critical acclaim. Maeterlinck's most famous plays are The Intruder (1890), The Blind (1890), and Pell\u00e9as and M\u00e9lisande (1892), but he wrote over thirty plays in total. His plays were often described as symbolist, as they were characterized by a dreamlike atmosphere and complex symbolism. In his writing, he explored themes of death, the afterlife, and the mysteries of nature. Maeterlinck's work had a profound impact on the literary world and was an influence on many writers, including W.B. Yeats, Franz Kafka, and T.S. Eliot. Many of his plays were adapted into operas, including Pell\u00e9as and M\u00e9lisande, which was famously adapted by composer Claude Debussy. Maeterlinck died in Nice, France, in 1949, but his legacy lives on as one of the most influential writers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His impact on the literary world is still felt today through his contributions to the symbolist movement and his innovative exploration of language and form.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 162198}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Turkish Cypriots\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Turkish Cypriots or Cypriot Turks ( or K\u0131br\u0131sl\u0131 T\u00fcrkler; ) are mostly ethnic Turks originating from Cyprus. Following the Ottoman conquest of the island in 1571, about 30,000 Turkish settlers were given land once they arrived in Cyprus. Additionally, many of the island's local Christians converted to Islam during the early years of Ottoman rule. Nonetheless, the influx of mainly Muslim settlers to Cyprus continued intermittently until the end of the Ottoman period. Today, while Northern Cyprus is home to a significant part of the Turkish Cypriot population, the majority of Turkish Cypriots live abroad, forming the Turkish Cypriot diaspora. This diaspora came into existence after the Ottoman Empire transferred the control of the island to the British Empire, as many Turkish Cypriots emigrated primarily to Turkey and the United Kingdom for political and economic reasons. \n\nStandard Turkish is the official language of Northern Cyprus. The vernacular spoken by Turkish Cypriots is Cypriot Turkish, which has been influenced by Cypriot Greek as well as English.\n\nHistory\n\nPre-Ottoman Cyprus\nAlthough there was no settled Muslim population in Cyprus prior to the Ottoman conquest of 1570\u201371, some Ottoman Turks were captured and \ncarried off as prisoners to Cyprus in the year 1400 during Cypriot raids in the Asiatic and Egyptian coasts. Some of these captives accepted or were forced to convert to Christianity and were baptized; however, there were also some Turkish slaves who remained unbaptized. By 1425, some of these slaves helped the Mamluke army to gain access to Limassol Castle. Despite the release of some of the captives, after the payment of ransoms, most of the baptized Turks continued to remain on the island. The medieval Cypriot historian Leontios Machairas recalled that the baptized Turks were not permitted to leave Nicosia when the Mamlukes approached the city after the battle of Khirokitia in 1426. According to Professor Charles Fraser Beckingham, \"there must therefore have been some Cypriots, at least nominally Christian, who were of Turkish, Arab, or Egyptian origin.\"\n\nBy 1488, the Ottomans made their first attempt at conquering Cyprus when Sultan Bayezid II sent a fleet to conquer Famagusta. However, the attempt failed due to the timely intervention of a Venetian fleet. The Queen of Cyprus, Caterina Cornaro, was forced to relinquish her crown to the Republic of Venice in 1489. In the same year, Ottoman ships were seen off the coast of Karpas and the Venetians began to strengthen the fortifications of the island. By 1500, coastal raids by Ottoman vessels resulted in the heavy loss of Venetian fleets, forcing Venice to negotiate a peace treaty with the Ottoman Empire in 1503. However, by May 1539 Suleiman I decided to attack Limassol because the Venetians had been sheltering pirates who continuously attacked Ottoman ships. Limassol stayed under Ottoman control until a peace treaty was signed in 1540. Cyprus continued to be a haven for pirates who interrupted the safe passage of Ottoman trade ships and Muslim pilgrims sailing to Mecca and Medina. By 1569, pirates captured the Ottoman defterdar (treasurer) of Egypt, and Selim II decided to safeguard the sea route from Constantinople to Alexandria by conquering the island and clearing the eastern Mediterranean of all enemies in 1570\u201371.\n\nOttoman Cyprus\n\nThe basis for the emergence of a sizeable and enduring Turkish community in Cyprus emerged when Ottoman troops landed on the island in mid-May 1570 and seized it within a year from Venetian rule. The post-conquest period established a significant Muslim community which consisted of soldiers from the campaign who remained behind and further settlers who were brought from Anatolia as part of a traditional Ottoman population policy. There were also new converts to Islam on the island during the early years of Ottoman rule.\n\nIn addition to documented settlement of Anatolian peasants and craftsmen, as well as the arrival of soldiers, decrees were also issued banishing Anatolian tribes, \"undesirable\" persons, and members of various \"troublesome\" Muslim sects, principally those officially classified as heretical. This influx of mainly Muslim settlers to Cyprus continued intermittently until the end of the Ottoman period.\n\nSome Turkish Cypriots are descendants of Crypto-Christians, a phenomenon that was not uncommon in the Ottoman Empire given its multi-faith character. In Cyprus, many Latins and Maronites, as well as Greeks, converted to Islam at different points during Ottoman rule for a number of reasons ranging from collectively avoiding heavy taxation to ending an individual woman unhappy marriage. Their artificial embrace of Islam and their secret maintaining of Christianity led this group of crypto-Christians to be known in Greek as 'Linobamvaki' or the cotton-linen sect as they changed religion to curry favour with Ottoman officials during the day but practiced Catholicism at night. In 1636 the conditions for the Christians became intolerable and certain Christians decided to become Muslims. According to Palmieri (1905) the Maronites who became Muslims lived mainly in the Nicosia District and despite the fact that the Maronites turned to Muslims they never gave up their Christian faith and beliefs hoping to become Christians. This is why they baptized their children according to the Christian faith, but they also practiced circumcision. They also gave their children two names, a Muslim and a Christian one. Many of the villages and neighbouring areas accepted as Turkish Cypriot estates, were formerly Linobambaki activity centers. These include:\n\nBy the second quarter of the nineteenth century, approximately 30,000 Muslims were living in Cyprus, comprising about 35% of the total population. The fact that Turkish was the main language spoken by the Muslims of the island is a significant indicator that the majority of them were either Turkish-speaking Anatolians or otherwise from a Turkic background. Throughout the Ottoman rule, the demographic ratio between Christian \"Greeks\" and Muslim \"Turks\" fluctuated constantly. During 1745\u20131814, the Muslim Turkish Cypriots constituted the majority on the island compared to the Christian Greek Cypriots, being up to 75% of the total island population. However, by 1841, Turks made up 27% of the island's population. One of the reasons for this decline is because the Turkish community were obliged to serve in the Ottoman army for years, usually away from home, very often losing their lives in the endless wars of the Ottoman Empire. Another reason for the declining population was because of the emigration trend of some 15,000 Turkish Cypriots to Anatolia in 1878, when the Ottoman Turks handed over the administration of the island to Britain.\n\nBritish Cyprus\n\nBy 1878, during the Congress of Berlin, under the terms of the Anglo-Ottoman Cyprus Convention, the Ottoman Turks had agreed to assign Cyprus to Britain to occupy and rule, though not to possess as sovereign territory. According to the first British census of Cyprus, in 1881, 95% of the island's Muslims spoke Turkish as their mother tongue. As of the 1920s, the percentage of Greek-speaking Muslims had dropped from 5%, in 1881, to just under 2% of the total Muslim population. During the opening years of the twentieth century Ottomanism became an ever more popular identity held by the Cypriot Muslim intelligentsia, especially in the wake of the Young Turk Revolution of 1908. Increasing numbers of Young Turks who had turned against Sultan Abdul Hamid II sought refuge in Cyprus. A rising class of disgruntled intellectuals in the island's main urban centres gradually began to warm to the ideas of positivism, freedom and modernization. Spurred on by the rising calls for \"enosis\", the union with Greece, emanating from Greek Cypriots, an initially hesitant \"Turkism\" was also starting to appear in certain newspaper articles and to be heard in the political debates of the local intelligentsia of Cyprus. In line with the changes introduced in the Ottoman Empire after 1908, the curricula of Cyprus's Muslim schools, such as the \"Idadi\", were also altered to incorporate more secular teachings with increasingly Turkish nationalist undertones. Many of these graduates in due course ended up as teachers in the growing number of urban and rural schools that had begun to proliferate across the island by the 1920s.\n\nIn 1914 the Ottoman Empire joined the First World War against the Allied Forces and Britain annexed the island. Cyprus's Muslim inhabitants were officially asked to choose between adopting either British nationality or retaining their Ottoman subject status; about 4,000\u20138,500 Muslims decided to leave the island and move to Turkey. Following its defeat in World War I, the Ottoman Empire were faced with the Greco-Turkish War (1919\u20131922) whereby the Greek incursion into Anatolia aimed at claiming what Greece believed to be historically Greek territory. For the Ottoman Turks of Cyprus, already fearing the aims of enosis-seeking Greek Cypriots, reports of atrocities committed by the Greeks against the Turkish populations in Anatolia, and the Greek Occupation of Smyrna, produced further fears for their own future. Greek forces were routed in 1922 under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk who, in 1923, proclaimed the new Republic of Turkey and renounced irredentist claims to former Ottoman territories beyond the Anatolian heartland. Muslims in Cyprus were thus excluded from the nation-building project, though many still heeded Atat\u00fcrk's call to join in the establishment of the new nation-state, and opted for Turkish citizenship. Between 1881 and 1927 approximately 30,000 Turkish Cypriots emigrated to Turkey.\n\nThe 1920s was to prove a critical decade in terms of stricter ethno-religious compartments; hence, Muslim Cypriots who remained on the island gradually embraced the ideology of Turkish nationalism due to the impact of the Kemalist Revolution. At its core were the Kemalist values of secularism, modernization and westernization; reforms such as the introduction of the new Turkish alphabet, adoption of western dress and secularization, were adopted voluntarily by Muslim Turkish Cypriots, who had been prepared for such changes not just by the Tanzimat but also by several decades of British rule. Many of those Cypriots who until then had still identified themselves primarily as Muslims began now to see themselves principally as Turks in Cyprus.\n\nBy 1950, a Cypriot Enosis referendum in which 95.7% of Greek Cypriot voters supported a fight aimed at enosis, the union of Cyprus with Greece were led by an armed organisation, in 1955, called EOKA by Georgios Grivas which aimed at bringing down British rule and uniting the island of Cyprus with Greece. Turkish Cypriots had always reacted immediately against the objective of enosis; thus, the 1950s saw many Turkish Cypriots who were forced to flee from their homes. In 1958, Turkish Cypriots set up their own armed group called Turkish Resistance Organisation (TMT) and by early 1958, the first wave of armed conflict between the two communities began; a few hundred Turkish Cypriots left their villages and quarters in the mixed towns and never returned.\n\nRepublic of Cyprus\n\nBy 16 August 1960 the island of Cyprus became an independent state, the Republic of Cyprus, with power sharing between the two communities under the 1960 Zurich agreements, with Britain, Greece and Turkey as Guarantor Powers. Archbishop Makarios III was elected as president by the Greek Cypriots and Dr. Faz\u0131l K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck was elected as vice-president by the Turkish Cypriots. However, in December 1963, in the events known as \"Bloody Christmas\", when Makarios III attempted to modify the Constitution, Greek Cypriots initiated a military campaign against the Turkish Cypriots and began to attack Turkish inhabited villages; by early 1964, the Turkish Cypriots started to withdraw into armed enclaves where the Greek Cypriots blockaded them, resulting in some 25,000 Turkish Cypriots becoming refugees, or internally \"displaced persons\". This resulted in the UN peacekeeping force, UNFICYP, being stationed on the island as well as an external migration trend of thousands more Turkish Cypriots to the United Kingdom, Turkey, North America and Australia. With the rise to power of the Greek military junta, a decade later, in 1974, a group of right-wing Greek nationalists, EOKA B, who supported the union of Cyprus with Greece, launched a putsch. This action precipitated the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, which led to the capture of the present-day territory of Northern Cyprus the following month, after a ceasefire collapsed. The Turkish invasion resulted in the occupation of some 37% of the island in the north. After the Turkish invasion and the ensuing 1975 Vienna agreements, 60,000 Turkish Cypriots who lived in the south of the island fled to the north. The 1974\u20131975 movement was strictly organised by the Provisional Turkish Administration who tried to preserve village communities intact.\n\nTurkish Republic of Northern Cyprus\n\nIn 1983 the Turkish Cypriots declared their own state in the north, the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, which remains internationally unrecognised, except by Turkey. In 2004, a referendum for the unification of the island, the \"Annan Plan\", was accepted by 65% of Turkish Cypriots but rejected by 76% of Greek Cypriots.\n\nCulture\n\nThe Turkish Cypriots are Turkish-speaking, regard themselves as secular Muslims, and take pride in their Ottoman heritage. However, Turkish Cypriots differentiate themselves from mainlanders, especially from the religiously conservative settlers who have come to Cyprus more recently, but their strong connection to Turkey is nonetheless undisputed. Hence, the Turkish Cypriot identity is based on their ethnic Turkish roots and links to mainland Turkey, but also to their Cypriot character with cultural and linguistic similarities with Greek Cypriots. Their culture is heavily based on family ties linked to parents, siblings, and relatives; one's neighbourhood is also considered important as emphasis is given on helping those in need. Thus, much of their lives revolves around social activities, and food is a central feature of gatherings. Turkish Cypriot folk dances, music, and art are also integral parts of their culture.\n\nReligion\n\nThe majority of Turkish Cypriots (99%) are Sunni Muslims. However, the secularizing force of Kemalism has also exerted an impact on Turkish Cypriots. Religious practices are considered a matter of individual choice and many do not actively practice their religion. Alcohol is frequently consumed within the community and most Turkish Cypriot women do not cover their heads. Turkish Cypriot males are generally circumcised at a young age in accordance with religious beliefs, although, this practice appears more related to custom and tradition than to powerful religious motivation.\n\nThe social/religious phenomenon of crypto-Christianity was observed in Cyprus, as in other parts of the Ottoman Empire. The crypto-Christians of Cyprus were known as Linobambaki (= of linen and cotton). They are mentioned by foreign travellers as Turks who are secretly Greeks, observing the Greek Orthodox fasting (Turner 1815), drinking wine, eating pork and often taking Christian wives.\n\nLanguage\n\nThe Turkish language was introduced to Cyprus with the Ottoman conquest in 1571 and became the politically dominant, prestigious language, of the administration. In the post-Ottoman period, Cypriot Turkish was relatively isolated from standard Turkish and had strong influences by the Cypriot Greek dialect. The condition of coexistence with the Greek Cypriots led to a certain bilingualism whereby Turkish Cypriots' knowledge of Greek was important in areas where the two communities lived and worked together.\n\nAccording to Prof. C. F. Beckingham (1957), in Cyprus religious and linguistic divisions do not always coincide. There were \"Turkish\", i.e. Muslim villages in which the normal language was Greek. Among them were Lapithiou, Platanisto, Ayios Simeon Beckingham said that this phenomenon has not been adequately investigated.{{sfn|Beckingham|1957|p=166|ps=:In Cyprus religious and linguistic divisions do not quite coincide. While many Turks habitually speak Turkish there are 'Turkish', that is, Muslim villages in which the normal language is Greek; among them are Lapithiou (P i), Platanisso (F i), Ayios Simeon (F i) and Galinoporni (F i). This fact has not yet been adequately investigated. With the growth of national feeling and the spread of education, the phenomenon is becoming not only rarer but harder to detect. In a Muslim village the school teacher will be a Turk and will teach the children Turkish. They already think of themselves as Turks, and having once learnt the language, will sometimes use it in talking to a visitor in preference to Greek, merely as a matter of national pride. On the other hand, many Turks, whose mother tongue is Turkish, learn Greek because they find it useful to understand the language of the majority, though it is much less common for them to write it correctly}} The existence of Greek-speaking Muslims is also mentioned in subsequent works. Ozan G\u00fclle (2014), \"it is historically well documented that Turkish Cypriots showed large differences in their frequency of communication in Cypriot Greek [...]: On one end of the spectrum are Turkish Cypriots who were probably monolingual Cypriot Greek speakers or had only little competency in Turkish, ...\".\n\nThe linguistic situation changed radically in 1974, following the division of Cyprus into a Greek south and a Turkish north. Today, the Cypriot Turkish dialect is being exposed to increasing standard Turkish through immigration from Turkey, new mass media, and new educational institutions. Nonetheless, a Turkish speaker familiar with the Cypriot Turkish variety of Turkish can still easily identify a member of the community from one who is not. Although many Turkish Cypriots command standard Turkish as well, they generally choose to use their own variety in particular contexts to affirm their identity. Most commonly, these differences are in pronunciation, but they extend to lexicon and grammatical structures as well. There are many words used by Turkish Cypriots that originate in the particular historical circumstances of the island, including English and Greek, and therefore have no precedent in standard Turkish. There are also words used by the Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot communities which are authentically Cypriot in origin.\n\nMusic and dances\n\nFolk music and dancing is an integral part of social life among Turkish Cypriots. Traditional Turkish Cypriot folk dances can be divided into five categories: Karsilamas, Sirtos, Zeybeks, Ciftetellis/Arabiyes, and Topical Dances (such as Orak, Kozan, Kartal and Topal). The folk dancing groups usually have performances during national festivals, weddings, Turkish nights at hotels and within tourism areas.\n\nDemographics\n\nDebates on the Turkish Cypriot population in the 1970s\nThe 1960 census of Cyprus reported the Turkish Cypriot population as 18% of the total population. The figure was challenged at in a 1978 debate in the British Parliament when Lord Spens stated that there were 400,000 Turkish Cypriots in Cyprus, at least one-fifth of the population.\n\n2006 Census\nAccording to the 2006 Northern Cyprus Census, there were 145,443 Turkish Cypriots born on the island who were resident in Northern Cyprus (TRNC). Of the Cypriot-born population, 120,007 had both parents born in Cyprus; 12,628 had one of their parents born in Cyprus and the other born in another country. Thus, 132,635 Turkish Cypriots had at least one parent born in Cyprus.\n\n2011 Census\nAccording to the 2011 Northern Cyprus Census, there were 160,207 Turkish Cypriots born on the island who were resident in North Cyprus (TRNC).\n\nDiaspora\n\nThere was significant Turkish Cypriot emigration from the island during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, mainly to Great Britain, Australia, and Turkey. Emigration from Cyprus has mainly been for economical and political reasons. According to the TRNC Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in 2001, 500,000 Turkish Cypriots were living in Turkey; 200,000 in Great Britain; 40,000 in Australia; some 10,000 in North America; and 5,000 in other countries.\n\nA more recent estimate, in 2011, by the Home Affairs Committee states that there are now 300,000 Turkish Cypriots living in the United Kingdom though Turkish Cypriots themselves claim that the British-Turkish Cypriot community has reached 400,000. Furthermore, recent estimates suggest that there are between 60,000 and 120,000 Turkish Cypriots living in Australia, 5,000 in the United States, 2,000 in Germany, 1,800 in Canada, 1,600 in New Zealand, and a smaller community in South Africa.\n\nTurkey\n\nThe first mass migration of Turkish Cypriots to Turkey occurred in 1878 when the Ottoman Empire leased Cyprus to Great Britain. The flow of Turkish Cypriot emigration to Turkey continued in the aftermath of the First World War, and gained its greatest velocity in the mid-1920s. Economic motives played an important part of the continued migration to Turkey because conditions for the poor in Cyprus during the 1920s were especially harsh. Thereafter, Turkish Cypriots continued to migrate to Turkey during the Second World War in the 1940s and during the Cyprus conflict of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nInitially, enthusiasm to emigrate to Turkey was inflated by the euphoria that greeted the birth of the newly established Republic of Turkey and later of promises of assistance to Turks who emigrated. A decision taken by the Turkish Government at the end of 1925, for instance, noted that the Turks of Cyprus had, according to the Treaty of Lausanne, the right to emigrate to the republic, and therefore, families that so emigrated would be given a house and sufficient land. The precise number of those who emigrated to Turkey is a matter that remains unknown. The press in Turkey reported in mid-1927 that of those who had opted for Turkish nationality, 5,000\u20136,000 Turkish Cypriots had already settled in Turkey. However, many Turkish Cypriots had already emigrated even before the rights accorded to them under the Treaty of Lausanne had come into force.\n\nMetin Heper and Bilge Criss have summarized the migration of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century as follows:\n\nSt. John-Jones has analyzed the migration of Turkish Cypriots during early British rule further:\n\nThe Turkish Cypriot population in Turkey continued to increase at fluctuating speeds as a result of the Second World War (1939\u20131945). According to Ali Suat Bilge, taking into consideration the mass migrations of 1878, the First World War, the 1920s early Turkish Republican era, and the Second World War, overall, a total of approximately 100,000 Turkish Cypriots had left the island for Turkey between 1878 and 1945. By 31 August 1955, a statement by Turkey's Minister of State and Acting Foreign Minister, Fatin R\u00fc\u015ft\u00fc Zorlu, at the London Conference on Cyprus, estimated that the total Turkish Cypriot population (including descendants) in Turkey had reached 300,000: \n\nBy 2001 the TRNC Ministry of Foreign Affairs estimated that 500,000 Turkish Cypriots were living in Turkey.\n\nPalestine\nTurkish Cypriots who remained in Cyprus during the early twentieth century were faced with the harsh economic conditions of the Great Depression under British rule. Consequently, many families in the poorest villages, facing debt and starvation, married off their daughters to Arabs mainly in British Palestine, and other Arab countries, in the hope that they would have a better life. A bride price was normally given by the groom to the family of the girls, usually about \u00a310-20, enough to buy several acres of land at the time, as part of the marriage arrangements.. Such payments had not been part of Cypriot tradition, and Cypriots typically describe the girls in these forced marriages as having been \"sold\"; Arabs however, often object to this characterization. Mostly between the ages of 11\u201318, the majority of the girls lost contact with their families in Cyprus, and while some had successful marriages and families, others found themselves little more than domestic servants, abused, or ended up working in brothels.\n\nThe marriages were sometimes arranged by brokers, who presented the prospective husbands as wealthy doctors and engineers. However, Neriman Cahit, in her book Brides for Sale, found that in reality many of these men had mediocre jobs or were already married with children. Unaware of these realities, Turkish Cypriot families continued to send their daughters to Palestine until the 1950s. Cahit estimates that within 30 years up to 4,000 Turkish Cypriot women were sent to Palestine to be married to Arab men.\n\nIn recent years second and third generation Palestinians of Turkish Cypriot origin have been applying for Cypriot citizenship; several hundred Palestinians have already been successful in obtaining Cypriot passports.\n\nIn 2012 Yeliz Shukri and Stavros Papageorghiou secured financial support for the making of a film on the subject of the \"Forgotten Brides\". The documentary, entitled Missing Fetine, was released in 2018, and follows the search of Australian-born Turkish Cypriot Pembe Mentesh for her long-lost great-aunt, while investigating the fate of these Turkish Cypriot women.\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nTurkish Cypriot migration to the United Kingdom began in the early 1920s, the British Empire having formally annexed Cyprus in 1914, with the residents of British-ruled Cyprus becoming subjects of the Crown. Some arrived as students and tourists, while others left the island due to the harsh economic and political life during the British colony of Cyprus. Emigration to the United Kingdom continued to increase when the Great Depression of 1929 brought economic depression to Cyprus, with unemployment and low wages being a significant issue. During the Second World War, the number of Turkish run cafes increased from 20 in 1939 to 200 in 1945 which created a demand for more Turkish Cypriot workers. Throughout the 1950s, Turkish Cypriots emigrated for economic reasons and by 1958 their number was estimated to be 8,500. Their numbers continued to increase each year as rumours about immigration restrictions appeared in much of the Cypriot media.\n\nThe 1950s also saw the arrival of many Turkish Cypriots to the United Kingdom due to political reasons; many began to flee as a result of the EOKA struggle and its aim of \"enosis\". Once the ethnic cleansing broke out in 1963, and some 25,000 Turkish Cypriots became internally displaced, accounting to about a fifth of their population. The political and economic unrest in Cyprus, after 1964, sharply increased the number of Turkish Cypriot immigrants to the United Kingdom. Many of these early migrants worked in the clothing industry in London, where both men and women could work together; many worked in the textile industry as sewing was a skill which the community had already acquired in Cyprus. Turkish Cypriots were concentrated mainly in the north-east of London and specialised in the heavy-wear sector, such as coats and tailored garments. This sector offered work opportunities where poor knowledge of the English language was not a problem and where self-employment was a possibility.\n\nOnce the Turkish Cypriots declared their own state, the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, the division of the island led to an economic embargo against the Turkish Cypriots by the Greek Cypriot controlled Republic of Cyprus. This had the effect of depriving the Turkish Cypriots of foreign investment, aid and export markets; thus, it caused the Turkish Cypriot economy to remain stagnant and undeveloped. Due to these economic and political issues, an estimated 130,000 Turkish Cypriots have emigrated from Northern Cyprus since its establishment to the United Kingdom.\n\nGenetic studies\nAccording to genetic studies, there are close connections between modern Anatolian and Cypriot populations. A 2016 study, which focused on patrilineal ancestry, found that among the sampled Near Eastern and Southeastern European populations, Turkish Cypriots had the shortest genetic distances with those from Cyprus, Turkey, Lebanon, Greece, and Sicily.\n\nA 2017 study found that both Turkish Cypriots' and Greek Cypriots' patrilineal ancestry derives primarily from a single pre-Ottoman local gene pool. The frequency of total haplotypes shared between Turkish and Greek Cypriots is 7-8%, with analysis showing that none of these are found in Turkey, thus not supporting a Turkish origin for the shared haplotypes. No shared haplotypes were observed between Greek Cypriots and mainland Turkish populations, while total haplotypes shared between Turkish Cypriots and mainland Turks is 3%. Turkish Cypriots also share haplotypes with North Africans to a lesser extent, and have Eastern Eurasian haplogroups (H, C, N, O, Q) \u2013 attributed to the arrival of the Ottomans \u2013 at a frequency of ~5.5%. Both Cypriot groups show close genetic affinity to Calabrian (southern Italy) and Lebanese patrilineages. The study states that the genetic affinity between Calabrians and Cypriots can be explained as a result of a common ancient Greek (Achaean) genetic contribution, while Lebanese affinity can be explained through several migrations that took place from coastal Levant to Cyprus from the Neolithic (early farmers), the Iron Age (Phoenicians), and the Middle Ages (Maronites and other Levantine settlers during the Frankish era). The predominant haplogroups among both Turkish and Greek Cypriots are J2a-M410, E-M78, and G2-P287.\n\nIn a 2019 genome-wide study, Cypriot samples grouped with people from the Levant (Druze, Lebanese and Syrians) and Armenia among the sampled populations from Eurasia and Africa, using cluster analysis based on haplotype-sharing patterns.\n\nHomozygous beta thalassemia in a number of at-risk populations (Greek and Turkish Cypriots, Greeks, Continental Italians and Sardinians) has been prevented at the population level by programmes based on carrier screening, genetic counselling and prenatal diagnosis.\n\nNotable Turkish Cypriots\n\nIn Cyprus\n\nIn the diaspora\n\nParliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe\nTurkish Cypriot representatives of Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) elected in the Assembly of 1960 partnership government: 1961\u20131964: Halit Ali Riza, 1961\u20131963: Umit Suleyman,\n1963\u20131964: Burhan Nalbantoglu.\n\nTurkish Cypriot representatives of PACE elected in the Assembly of Northern Cyprus: \n(TCs have 2 seats in PACE; the parties of elected members are shown) 2005\u20132007: CTP \u00d6zdil Nami; UBP H\u00fcseyin \u00d6zg\u00fcrg\u00fcn; 27.01.2011 CTP Mehmet Caglar; UBP Ahmet Eti; 04.12.2013 CTP Mehmet Caglar, UBP Tahsin Ertu\u011frulo\u011flu\n\nSee also\n Turkish Cypriot diaspora\n Northern Cypriot passport\n List of Turkish Cypriots \n List of Cypriots \n Cypriot refugees\n Greek Cypriots\n Turkish minorities in the former Ottoman Empire, neighbouring communities:\nTurkish Bulgarians\nTurkish Egyptians\nTurkish Iraqis \nTurkish Lebanese\nTurkish Meskhetians \nTurkish Syrians \nTurkish Western Thracians\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\n .\n . \n.\n .\n .\n .\n.\n.\n .\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n .\n .\n.\n.\n.\n\n .\n.\n.\n.\n .\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n .\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n \n.\n.\n \n.\n.\n\n .\n.\n\n.\n\nFurther reading\n\n Baybars, Taner, Plucked in a far-off land, London: Victor Gollancz, 1970.\n Beckingham, C.

They comprise approximately 18% of the island's total population and mostly reside in the northern part of the island, which is under Turkish Cypriot administration. The Turkish Cypriot community has a rich cultural history, with a unique blend of Turkish, Greek, and Middle Eastern influences. The history of the Turkish Cypriot community is intertwined with the island's complex political situation. Cyprus was a British colony from 1878 to 1960, when it gained independence as a bi-communal republic with a Greek Cypriot majority and Turkish Cypriot minority. However, tensions between the two communities escalated until they erupted into violence in 1963. The situation worsened in 1974, when a Greek Cypriot coup was met with a Turkish invasion, resulting in the northern part of the island being controlled by Turkish Cypriots. Since then, the Turkish Cypriots have established their own self-declared state, known as the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, although this is not recognized by the international community. The division of the island has had a significant impact on the Turkish Cypriot community, with economic difficulties and political isolation being major issues. Despite the challenges they face, the Turkish Cypriot community has a vibrant culture, with festivals and celebrations throughout the year. They are renowned for their cuisine, particularly their use of fresh herbs and spices in dishes such as kebab and meze. The Turkish Cypriot dialect is also distinctive, with influences from both Turkish and Greek. The Turkish Cypriot community has made significant contributions to the island's history and culture, despite the difficulties they have faced. They continue to work towards a resolution to the Cyprus issue and a more prosperous future for all Cypriots.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 934562}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Crothersville, Indiana\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Crothersville is a town in Vernon Township, Jackson County, Indiana, United States.

About 7.3% of families and 8.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including 8.5% of those under age 18 and 7.3% of those age 65 or over.\n\nAdult store controversy\nLion's Den, a store selling adult sexual products and pornography, opened in Crothersville near the Interstate 65 exit in 2005. From the day the store opened, Christian protestors photographed persons entering the store parking lot day and night from a surveillance structure on frontage property. According to a protest organizer, Pastor Jon Pearce of First Baptist Church of Crothersville, people in the community were motivated by rumors, never substantiated, that Lion's Den was \"gonna have videos and stuff on bestiality and just all kinds of terrible things about chasing down young girls and raping them.\"\n\nThe protestors, who called themselves the Uniontown Watchdogs, also wrote down license plates and notified trucking companies that their drivers were allegedly patronizing the store. Photographs of alleged patrons were posted to a web site. Reportedly, \"a parole officer from another county ran the plate numbers recorded by the Watchdogs.\" The protestors placed signs at the store's parking lot entrance which read, \"Warning! All license plates are recorded!\" and \"Over 2 million will see you on war-line.net.\" They sometimes yelled comments at persons who entered the property and offered free Bibles.\n\nThe protests were not without controversy however. In addition to building a platform to look over a fence constructed by the business to maintain their practice of photographing people walking in and out of the store, several complaints were also issued over the shining of a floodlight in the faces of drivers passing by, in preparation to take a photograph if they entered the property, leading to several near misses with protesters and other autos.\n\nOn July 30, 2010, in response to a lawsuit filed by Jackson County, special Bartholomew Circuit Court judge Stephen R. Heimann, a Democrat, ruled that the store violated a county licensing ordinance and must be closed. He ruled that the county could constitutionally bar the business from operating at the location as part of its intent to protect the health, safety, and welfare of county residents, and that the ordinance was content neutral since it did not seek to ban adult businesses. Lion's Den violated the ordinance because it was operating within 1,000 feet of a residence. Jackson County commissioners adopted the ordinance three days before Lion's Den opened, after they discovered it was going to be an adult business. The store closed within days after the ruling while Lion's Den appealed the case. On June 7, 2011, the Court of Appeals of Indiana unanimously affirmed Judge Heimann's ruling. Lion's Den is an Ohio-based company with about 30 stores across the United States at the time of the Crothersville conflict.\n\nIn 2008, Melvin Ray Owen, a spokesman and organizer for the anti-pornography protesters was arrested for sexual battery on a girl of 16.  Reverend Roger Smith, who testified on behalf of Owen, told the court, that Owen was \"touchy-feely. He hugs everybody in church. It is out of character for him be anything but someone who wants to do good.\u201d Owen claimed that he was the victim of an aggressive girl who had been propositioning him: \u201cI touched her breast, I did. I also blowed on her hair and punched her ribs. It wasn\u2019t an accident and I\u2019ll tell you why. I touched her to try to get her off my lap and she wouldn\u2019t get off it.\" After changing his plea to guilty, Owen was sentenced to 90 days in jail and 90 days home incarceration.\n\nDrug bootlegging and a homicide\nOn February 10, 2005, Crothersville was featured in a New York Times article about the town's alleged \"scourge of methamphetamine.\" The Times''' narrative was that a town \"where everyone seems somehow related,\" is \"seemingly transformed\" by the death of a 10-year-old, Katlyn Collman, who \"police say...stumbled on (sic) someone with methamphetamine...\" The story highlights a Crothersville stricken with fear after the death and the discovery of two facilities for making bootleg methamphetamine. Without explaining who they are or where they have gone, the article claims that \"Shady characters no longer stalk the streets of the one-stoplight town, where ribbons of blue, Katie's favorite color, hang from utility poles and porches. Gone, too, are the bike-riding and dog-walking youngsters, now let outside to play only with their parents, or in groups.\" One father \"said he checks what his 10-year-old son and 7-year-old daughter are wearing each morning, for fear of having to describe them to the police.\" The article claims that in \"Jackson County, which includes Crothersville, meth-related arrests skyrocketed to 116 in 2004 from 29 in 2002.\" Pastor Jon Pearce, who helped to organize the protest against Lion's Den, is quoted regarding the purported illegal drug problem: \"If we had a brothel move into town, people would close it down instantly. If we had an X-rated movie house come, it'd be gone within a week. But this has been here. It is a monster. We didn't know what kind of monster it was.\" The Times article includes no crime statistics for Crothersville that might affirm the implication that the town was dangerous.\n\nOn May 25, 2005, the Times reported that, \"Tossing aside their original theory that a 10-year-old Indiana girl was murdered because she saw people making methamphetamine, prosecutors on Friday dropped charges against the man whose statements led them to that belief, charging instead another man connected by DNA and other physical evidence to the crime.\" The Times quoted a local merchant claiming to have \"sold 2,000 T-shirts with Katie's photograph to people in four states, [who] said that even if the methamphetamine theory had no merit, the murder 'shined a light on the drug problem' in town.\" The Times reported, \"Steven Drizin, legal director of the Center on Wrongful Convictions at Northwestern University, said the case had the hallmark of a false, coerced confession..\" The Times'' did not refer to or retract its own inaccurate reporting in the February article.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Inspirations for James Bond\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "A number of real-life inspirations have been suggested for James Bond, the fictional character created in 1953 by British author, journalist and Naval Intelligence officer Ian Fleming; Bond appeared in twelve novels and nine short stories by Fleming, as well as a number of continuation novels and twenty-six films, with seven actors playing the role of Bond.\n\nAlthough the stories and characters were fictional, a number of elements had a real-life background, taken from people whom Fleming knew or events he was aware of. These included the spy's name, which Fleming took from the American ornithologist James Bond, and the code number\u2014007\u2014which referred to the breaking of a World War I German diplomatic code. Some aspects of Bond's character and tastes replicate those of Fleming himself.\n\nApparently, inspiration for the James Bond spy novels may have come from the writings of William Le Queux; inspiration for the James Bond films may have come from the early silent films of German director Fritz Lang, including the Dr. Mabuse films, and the 1928 film Spione.\n\nOrigins of the name\n\nOn the morning of 17 February 1952, Ian Fleming started writing what would become his first book, Casino Royale, at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica. He typed out 2,000 words in the morning, directly from his own experiences and imagination and finished work on the manuscript in just over a month, completing it on 18 March 1952. Fleming took the name for his character from that of the American ornithologist James Bond, a Caribbean bird expert and author of the definitive field guide Birds of the West Indies; Fleming, a keen birdwatcher himself, had a copy of Bond's guide and he later explained to the ornithologist's wife that \"It struck me that this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet very masculine name was just what I needed, and so a second James Bond was born\".\n\nOn another occasion Fleming said: \"I wanted the simplest, dullest, plainest-sounding name I could find, 'James Bond' was much better than something more interesting, like 'Peregrine Carruthers'. Exotic things would happen to and around him, but he would be a neutral figure\u2014an anonymous, blunt instrument wielded by a government department.\" After Fleming met the ornithologist and his wife, he described them as \"a charming couple who are amused by the whole joke\". The ornithologist was obliquely referred to in the film Die Another Day with Pierce Brosnan's Bond picking up a copy of Birds of the West Indies and posing as an ornithologist.\n\nCharacter inspirations\n\nDominican playboy, diplomat, soldier, polo player and race car driver \"Porfirio Rubirosa\" was the main influence for the character according to lawyer and historian \"Daniel J. Voelker\"\nRubirosa was a man who made his mark for his international lifestyle, jetsetting and massive success with women, out of his five spouses, two of them were the richest women in the world at that time. Voelker wrote that Fleiming refrained from publicising his muse for fear that racism would harm the sale of the book, Rubirosa was from mixed racial background and Fleming's audience in the 1950s and early 60s may not have been accepting of such revelation, he also wrote that out of all the rumoured inspirations from the character only Rubirosa checks all the boxes, claiming the similarities between the par and uncanny, he brought comparisions between Fleming's and Rubirosa's lives, interests, lovers, admirers and cyrcle of friends over a 30 year old period and all of them seem to coincide.\n\nIn other interview, Voelker stated that:\n\u201cTwo of the main focal points can be found through internationally famous celebrities Errol Flynn and Noel Coward. Friends with both Fleming and Rubirosa, these two lived between Fleming and Rubirosa in the Caribbean, traveled and partied with both of them and even shared a \u2018love connection\u2019 through certain well known women, including Rita Hayworth and Eva Per\u00f3n.\u201d which can lead to another proof that character was inspired by the controversial man.\n\nDuring the Second World War Fleming was the personal assistant to the director of the Naval Intelligence Division, Admiral John Godfrey. He reached the rank of commander\u2014a rank he subsequently gave to his fictional creation\u2014and was the planner for special operations unit 30th Assault Unit. Many of Bond's tastes and traits were Fleming's own, including sharing the same golf handicap, the taste for scrambled eggs and using the same brand of toiletries. Bond's tastes are also often taken from Fleming's, as was his behaviour, with Bond's love of golf and gambling mirroring his creator's. Fleming used the experiences of his espionage career and other aspects of his life as inspiration when writing, including using names of school friends, acquaintances, relatives and lovers throughout his books.\n\nBond's cigarettes were also the same as Fleming's, who had been buying his custom-made by Morland since the 1930s; Fleming added the three gold bands on the filter during the war to mirror his naval Commander's rank. On average, Bond smokes sixty cigarettes a day, although he cut back to around twenty-five a day after his visit to a health farm in Thunderball. Fleming himself smoked up to eighty cigarettes a day. Apart from imbuing Bond with his own tastes, Fleming based his fictional creation on a number of individuals he came across during his time in intelligence, admitting that Bond \"was a compound of all the secret agents and commando types I met during the war\".\n\nThe Institute of National Remembrance revealed in 2020 that James Albert Bond (1928 \u2013 2005), a British diplomat born in Bideford, Devon, had worked at the British Embassy in Warsaw with arrival of Warsaw on 18 February 1964 and left the territory of the Polish People's Republic on 21 January 1965. Released documents confirm that he conducted espionage activities. It is unclear whether Ian Fleming was aware of the existence of an actual spy named James Albert Bond. James Albert Bond had a son with his wife Janette Tacchi who is also called James, born in 1955.\n\nLiterary Inspirations\nBesides real life individuals, James Bond was also inspired by one of Dennis Wheatley's characters; the secret agent Gregory Sallust,  based on Wheatley's late friend Gordon Eric Gordon-Tombe. It is also said that the character of James Bond took inspiration from a collection of short stories about a gentlemanly and sophisticated spy by Somerset Maugham, using his own spying experience as a basis. Another inspiration for the James Bond spy novels may have come from the writings of William Le Queux.\n\nAs well, inspiration of James Bond films may have come from the early silent films of German director Fritz Lang, including the Dr. Mabuse films, and the 1928 film Spione.\n\nInspiration for \"007\"\nThe 007 number assigned to James Bond may have been influenced by any number of sources. In the films and novels, the 00 prefix indicates Bond's discretionary \"licence to kill\", in executing his duties. Bond's number\u2014007\u2014was assigned by Fleming in reference to one of British naval intelligence's key achievements of World War I: the breaking of the German diplomatic code.\n\nOne of the German documents cracked and read by the British was the Zimmermann Telegram, which was coded 0075, and which was one of the factors that led to the US entering the war. Subsequently, if material was graded 00 it meant it was highly classified and, as journalist Ben Macintyre has pointed out, \"to anyone versed in intelligence history, 007 signified the highest achievement of British military intelligence.\"\n\nJohn Dee, who was accused of spying for the crown, signed his letters to Elizabeth I, Queen of England between 1558 and 1603, with a \"007\" symbol, marking them thereby as personal \u2013 destined for her majesty's eyes only.\n\nSee also\n Outline of James Bond\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\nExternal links\n Official website of Ian Fleming Publications\n\nJames Bond\nJames Bond lists\nBond, James", "machine_text": "Inspirations for James Bond James Bond is one of the most iconic characters in popular culture, with a long-standing legacy spanning over six decades. Since his first appearance in Ian Fleming\u2019s novel Casino Royale in 1953, Bond has gone on to become one of the most recognizable characters in the world. The character of James Bond was heavily inspired by Fleming\u2019s own life experiences and a number of real-life individuals. Fleming was a former naval intelligence officer and drew upon his experiences during World War II for much of the material in his novels. One of the key inspirations for Bond was Fleming himself. The author shared many traits with his protagonist, including his love of gadgets, gambling, and fast cars. Another inspiration for James Bond was Fleming\u2019s friend and fellow writer, Roald Dahl. Dahl was a fighter pilot during World War II and later went on to become a successful children\u2019s author. He provided Fleming with inspiration for some of the more fantastical elements of the Bond series, such as the gadgets and the villains. Other inspirations for Bond include real-life spies and intelligence officers. One such individual was Sidney Reilly, who was known as the 'Ace of Spies' and was active during the early part of the 20th century. Reilly was renowned for his exploits in Russia, Germany, and the Far East, and his daring and charismatic nature is said to have influenced Fleming's creation of the Bond character. Fleming was also influenced by popular culture at the time, such as the works of crime novelists Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett, whose tough-talking and gritty detective stories inspired much of the tone of the Bond novels. Ultimately, the character of James Bond is a reflection of the world in which he was created. He embodies the glamour, danger, and excitement of the post-war era, with his stories taking readers on thrilling adventures to exotic locations around the world. With each new generation, Bond continues to capture the imagination of audiences everywhere, making him one of the greatest fictional heroes of all time.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1372579}

It marked the beginning of the Abbasid decline, the rise of smaller kingdoms, and the emergence of new intellectual and religious movements. The following is a timeline of the major events that shaped 10th-century Muslim history. 900 CE: The Samanid Empire The Samanid Empire, a Persian Muslim state, began its rule over parts of Iran, Central Asia, and Afghanistan. The Samanids were patrons of arts and sciences and played a significant role in the Islamic Golden Age. 930 CE: The Fatimid Caliphate The Fatimid Caliphate was founded in Tunisia by the Ismaili Shia sect. The Fatimids claimed to be descendants of Prophet Muhammad's daughter Fatima and her husband Ali. The Fatimid Caliphate eventually came to rule over Egypt and parts of the Levant. 945 CE: The Buyid Dynasty The Buyid Dynasty, a Persian Shia Muslim dynasty, conquered Baghdad and founded the Buyid Caliphate. The Buyids ruled over Iran, Iraq, and parts of Arabia for over a century. 969 CE: The Fatimid Conquest of Egypt The Fatimids conquered Egypt from the Abbasids and founded the city of Cairo as their capital. The Fatimid rule over Egypt was marked by their support for the arts and architecture, as seen in their famous Mosque of al-Azhar. 976 CE: The Ghaznavid Empire The Ghaznavids, a Sunni Muslim dynasty of Turkic origin, began their rule over modern-day Afghanistan and parts of Iran, Pakistan, and India. The Ghaznavids are known for their patronage of poetry, particularly the works of the Persian poet Ferdowsi. 996 CE: The Rise of the Seljuk Turks The Seljuk Turks, a Sunni Muslim tribe from Central Asia, began their conquest of Muslim lands. They defeated the Ghaznavids and conquered Baghdad, marking the beginning of the Seljuk Empire. In conclusion, the 10th century was a period of great diversity and change in the Islamic world. The emergence of new kingdoms and religious movements, along with the continuation of the Golden Age of Islam, marked a pivotal era in Muslim history.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1299084}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Automatic bug fixing\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Automatic bug-fixing is the automatic repair of software bugs without the intervention of a human programmer. It is also commonly referred to as automatic patch generation, automatic bug repair, or automatic program repair. The typical goal of such techniques is to automatically generate correct patches to eliminate bugs in software programs without causing software regression.\n\nSpecification \n\nAutomatic bug fixing is made according to a specification of the expected behavior which can be for instance a formal specification or a test suite.\n\nA test-suite \u2013 the input/output pairs specify the functionality of the program, possibly captured in assertions can be used as a test oracle to drive the search. This oracle can in fact be divided between the bug oracle that exposes the faulty behavior, and the regression oracle, which encapsulates the functionality any program repair method must preserve. Note that a test suite is typically incomplete and does not cover all possible cases. Therefore, it is often possible for a validated patch to produce expected outputs for all inputs in the test suite but incorrect outputs for other inputs. The existence of such validated but incorrect patches is a major challenge for generate-and-validate techniques. Recent successful automatic bug-fixing techniques often rely on additional information other than the test suite, such as information learned from previous human patches, to further identify correct patches among validated patches.\n\nAnother way to specify the expected behavior is to use formal specifications Verification against full specifications that specify the whole program behavior including functionalities is less common because such specifications are typically not available in practice and the computation cost of such verification is prohibitive. For specific classes of errors, however, implicit partial specifications are often available. For example, there are targeted bug-fixing techniques validating that the patched program can no longer trigger overflow errors in the same execution path.\n\nTechniques\n\nGenerate-and-validate \n\nGenerate-and-validate approaches compile and test each candidate patch to collect all validated patches that produce expected outputs for all inputs in the test suite. Such a technique typically starts with a test suite of the program, i.e., a set of test cases, at least one of which exposes the bug. An early generate-and-validate bug-fixing systems is GenProg. The effectiveness of generate-and-validate techniques remains controversial, because they typically do not provide patch correctness guarantees. Nevertheless, the reported results of recent state-of-the-art techniques are generally promising. For example, on systematically collected 69 real world bugs in eight large C software programs, the state-of-the-art bug-fixing system Prophet generates correct patches for 18 out of the 69 bugs.\n\nOne way to generate candidate patches is to apply mutation operators on the original program. Mutation operators manipulate the original program, potentially via its abstract syntax tree representation, or a more coarse-grained representation such as operating at the statement-level or block-level. Earlier genetic improvement approaches operate at the statement level and carry out simple delete/replace operations such as deleting an existing statement or replacing an existing statement with another statement in the same source file. Recent  approaches use more fine-grained operators at the abstract syntax tree level to generate more diverse set of candidate patches.\n\nAnother way to generate candidate patches consists of using fix templates. Fix templates are typically predefined changes for fixing specific classes of bugs. Examples of fix templates include inserting a conditional statement to check whether the value of a variable is null to fix null pointer exception, or changing an integer constant by one to fix off-by-one errors. It is also possible to automatically mine fix templates for generate-and-validate approaches.\n\nMany generate-and-validate techniques rely on the redundancy insight: the code of the patch can be found elsewhere in the application. This idea was introduced in the Genprog system, where two operators, addition and replacement of AST nodes, were based on code taken from elsewhere (i.e. adding an existing AST node). This idea has been validated empirically, with two independent studies that have shown that a significant proportion of commits (3%-17%) are composed of existing code. Beyond the fact that the code to reuse exists somewhere else, it has also been shown that the context of the potential repair ingredients is useful: often, the donor context is similar to the recipient context.\n\nSynthesis-based \n\nRepair techniques exist that are based on symbolic execution. For example, Semfix uses symbolic execution to extract a repair constraint. Angelix introduced the concept of angelic forest in order to deal with multiline patches.\n\nUnder certain assumptions, it is possible to state the repair problem as a synthesis problem.\nSemFix and Nopol uses component-based synthesis.\nDynamoth  uses dynamic synthesis.\nS3 is based on syntax-guided synthesis.\nSearchRepair converts potential patches into an SMT formula and queries candidate patches that allow the patched program to pass all supplied test cases.\n\nData-driven \n\nMachine learning techniques can improve the effectiveness of automatic bug-fixing systems. One example of such techniques learns from past successful patches from human developers collected from open source repositories in GitHub and SourceForge. It then use the learned information to recognize and prioritize potentially correct patches among all generated candidate patches. Alternatively, patches can be directly mined from existing sources. Example approaches include mining patches from donor applications or from QA web sites. Learning can done online, aka continual learning, with the known precedent of online learning of patches from the stream of open source build results from continuous integration.\n\nSequenceR uses sequence-to-sequence learning on source code in order to generate one-line patches. It defines a neural network architecture that works well with source code, with the copy mechanism that allows to produce patches with tokens that are not in the learned vocabulary. Those tokens are taken from the code of the Java class under repair.\n\nGetafix is a language-agnostic approach developed and used in production at Facebook. Given a sample of code commits where engineers fixed a certain kind of bug, it learns human-like fix patterns that apply to future bugs of the same kind. Besides using Facebook's own code repositories as training data, Getafix learnt some fixes from open source Java repositories. When new bugs get detected, Getafix applies its previously learnt patterns to produce candidate fixes and ranks them within seconds. It presents only the top-ranked fix for final validation by tools or an engineer, in order to save resources and ideally be so fast that no human time was spent on fixing the same bug, yet.\n\nOther \nTargeted automatic bug-fixing techniques generate repairs for specific classes of errors such as null pointer exception integer overflow , buffer overflow , memory leak ,  etc.. Such techniques often use empirical fix templates to fix bugs in the targeted scope. For example, insert a conditional statement to check whether the value of a variable is null or insert missing memory deallocation statements. Comparing to generate-and-validate techniques, targeted techniques tend to have better bug-fixing accuracy but a much narrowed scope.\n\nUse \n\nThere are multiple uses of automatic bug fixing:\n In a development environment: When encountering a bug the developer activates a feature to search for a patch (for instance by clicking on a button). This search can also happen in the background, when the IDE proactively searches for solutions to potential problems, without waiting for explicit action from the developer. \n In a continuous integration server: When a build fails during continuous integration, a patch search can be attempted as soon as the build has failed. If the search is successful, the patch is provided to the developer. When a synthesized patch is suggested to the developers as pull-request, an explanation has to be provided in addition to the code changes (e.g. a pull request title and description). An experiment has shown that generated patches can be accepted by open-source developers and merged in the code repository.\n At runtime: When a failure happens at runtime, a binary patch can be searched for and applied online. An example of such a repair system is ClearView, which does repair on x86 code, with x86 binary patches. The Itzal system is different from Clearview: while the repair search happens at runtime, in production, the produced patches are at the source code level. The BikiniProxy system does online repair of JavaScript errors happening in the browser.\n\nSearch space \n\nIn essence, automatic bug fixing is a search activity, whether deductive-based or heuristic-based. The search space of automatic bug fixing is composed of all edits that can be possibly made to a program. There have been studies to understand the structure of this search space. Qi et al. showed that the original fitness function of Genprog is not better than random search to drive the search. Martinez et al. explored the imbalance between possible repair actions, showing its significant impact on the search. Long et al.'s study indicated that correct patches can be considered as sparse in the search space and that incorrect overfitting patches are vastly more abundant (see also discussion about overfitting below).\n\nIf one explicitly enumerates all possible variants in a repair algorithm, this defines a design space for program repair. Each variant selects an algorithm involved at some point in the repair process (e.g. the fault localization algorithm), or selects a specific heuristic which yields different patches. For instance, in the design space of generate-and-validate program repair, there is one variation point about the granularity of the program elements to be modified: an expression, a statement, a block, etc.\n\nIt is also possible to analyze whether known search spaces encompass existing commits. Such a search space analysis means mining a software repository, this results in an approximation of the applicability and usefulness of a given repair algorithm.\n\nOverfitting \n\nSometimes, in test-suite based program repair, tools generate patches that pass the test suite, yet are actually incorrect, this is known as the \"overfitting\" problem. \"Overfitting\" in this context refers to the fact that the patch overfits to the test inputs. There are different kinds of overfitting: incomplete fixing means that only some buggy inputs are fixed, regression introduction means some previously working features are broken after the patch (because they were poorly tested). Early prototypes for automatic repair suffered a lot from overfitting: on the Manybugs C benchmark, Qi et al. reported that 104/110 of plausible GenProg patches were overfitting; on the Defects4J Java benchmark, Martinez et al. reported that 73/84 plausible patches as overfitting. In the context of synthesis-based repair, Le et al. obtained more than 80% of overfitting patches.\n\nOne way to avoid overfitting is to filter out the generated patches. This can be done based on dynamic analysis, or static code analysis of the generated patches. When a reference patch is available, a state of the art technique is to generate tests based on the patched version, such that the generated tests capture the expected behavior. While the sampling of the input domain by test generation is incomplete by construction, it has been shown to be effective at detecting overfitting patches, and even at finding human errors done during manual classification of patches.\n\nLimitations of automatic bug-fixing \n\nAutomatic bug-fixing techniques that rely on a test suite do not provide patch correctness guarantees, because the test suite is incomplete and does not cover all cases. A weak test suite may cause generate-and-validate techniques to produce validated but incorrect patches that have negative effects such as eliminating desirable functionalities, causing memory leaks, and introducing security vulnerabilities. One possible approach is to amplify the failing test suite by automatically generating further test cases that are then labelled as passing or failing. To minimize the human labelling effort, an automatic test oracle can be trained that gradually learns to automatically classify test cases as passing or failing and only engages the bug-reporting user for uncertain cases.\n\nA limitation of generate-and-validate repair systems is the search space explosion. For a program, there are a large number of statements to change and for each statement there are a large number of possible modifications. State-of-the-art systems address this problem by assuming that a small modification is enough for fixing a bug, resulting in a search space reduction.\n\nThe limitation of approaches based on symbolic analysis is that real world programs are often converted to intractably large formulas especially for modifying statements with side effects.\n\nBenchmarks \n\nBenchmarks of bugs typically focus on one specific programming language.\nIn C, the Manybugs benchmark collected by GenProg authors contains 69 real world defects and it is widely used to evaluate many other bug-fixing tools for C.\n\nIn Java, the main benchmark is Defects4J, initially explored by Martinez et al., and now extensively used in most research papers on program repair for Java. Alternative benchmarks exist, such as the Quixbugs benchmark, which contains original bugs for program repair. Other benchmarks of Java bugs include Bugs.jar, based on past commits, and BEARS which is a benchmark of continuous integration build failures.\n\nExample tools \n\nAutomatic bug-fixing is an active research topic in computer science. There are many implementations of various bug-fixing techniques especially for C and Java programs. Note that most of these implementations are research prototypes for demonstrating their techniques, i.e., it is unclear whether their current implementations are ready for industrial usage or not.\n\nC \n\n ClearView: A generate-and-validate tool of generating binary patches for deployed systems.

It is an emerging technology that has been developed to save time and money in software development by reducing the amount of time and effort required to fix software bugs. Automatic Bug Fixing uses algorithms to analyze and identify code errors and automatically fix them. The technology has been developed to work in various programming languages, including Java, Python, C, and C++. AutoFix, Parsifal, and DeepFix are some of the examples of automatic bug-fixing tools. These tools use a combination of machine learning techniques, constraint solving, and program synthesis to identify and fix code errors. The process of existing automatic bug-fixing tools involves analyzing software source code to find and repair issues. This is done by identifying and tracking which lines of code contain errors or bugs and then using algorithms to identify the most likely solution to fix the problem. The automated fix is then generated for the identified code. Although the use of automatic bug fixing technology can save time and reduce development costs, there are some limitations to its use. One of the biggest challenges is the lack of predictability of the automated fix. In some cases, the automatic fix may create new bugs in the code. Additionally, automatic bug fixing may not be effective in complex or highly specialized applications, where the quality of the code may be more important than the quantity. Despite these challenges, the development of automatic bug fixing technology is promising and may lead to the development of increasingly sophisticated tools. As the software industry becomes more and more reliant on technology, it has become increasingly important to develop bug-fixing solutions that can help developers to produce higher quality software in a more efficient way.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 48892446}

It is a museum of the National Historical and Cultural Reserve \u201cHetman's Capital\u201d and the only architectural masterpiece of Charles Cameron in Ukraine.\n\nHistory \n\nKyrylo Rozumovsky was Hetman of Ukraine from 1750\u20131764. During his hetmanship the city of Baturyn became the hetman's capital. Since 1794 Kyrylo Rozumovsky lived in Baturyn. It was then that he conceived the construction of a grand palace and park ensemble. During 1799\u20131803, the ensemble was built according to the project of the famous architect of Scottish origin Charles Cameron.\nThe ensemble consisted of a palace, two outbuildings and a regular planning park. After the hetman's death, in 1803 the ensemble became the property of his son Andriy Rozumovsky, who owned it until the end of his life (1836). In 1824, a fire destroyed almost all the interiors of the building. In 1856 the palace and park ensemble became state property. At the beginning of the twentieth century the ensemble had an abandoned state.\n\nIn the middle of the twentieth century the park was completely destroyed and the outbuildings were dismantled.\n\nIn 1924, a severe fire broke out there, causing significant damage to the structure. The facade of the building and the decorative ornaments on it were also seriously damaged during the Great Patriotic War.\n\nIn the second half of the twentieth century several attempts were made to restore the palace, which supported its condition but no restoration was completed.

The palace was built in the late 18th century and was designed in a classic style. It is three stories tall and is built with red and white brick. The palace\u2019s interior is decorated with lavish frescoes and grand halls that were used for meetings of the Cossack Rada, which was the supreme governing body of Cossack Ukraine. The palace played a significant role in Ukraine's history. It was the residence of Cossack Hetmans, including Kirill Razumovski, Ivan Skoropadsky, and Ivan Mazepa. It was also the venue for significant events such as the signing of the Treaty of Baturyn in 1667, which ended the Russo-Polish War, and the Kozyatyn Land Agreement in 1672. During its heyday, the Razumovski Palace was one of the most opulent and magnificent palaces in Ukraine. It was a symbol of the wealth, power, and prestige that the Cossacks enjoyed during their brief period of autonomy. Sadly, the palace fell into disrepair after the fall of the Hetmanate and the Russian Empire's annexation of Ukraine. In the 20th century, the palace was restored to its former glory. It now serves as a museum and cultural center that showcases the rich history of the Ukrainian Cossacks. The palace is an important tourist destination for those interested in Ukrainian history and culture. Overall, the Razumovski Palace is a stunning example of Ukrainian architecture and history. It has stood the test of time, and its significance in Ukrainian history cannot be overstated.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 28, 1999. The episode was written by Lewis Morton and directed by Jeffrey Lynch.\n\nPlot\nThe episode opens with Fry and Bender playing a violent, futuristic version of chess, where Bender's bishop and Fry's knight fight. Fry wins, prompting Bender to send all of his chess pieces after Fry.\n\nThe Planet Express crew arrives at the ribbon cutting of the new Democratic Order Of Planets (D.O.O.P.) headquarters in orbit around the Neutral Planet, in order to deliver the oversized scissors that will be used for the ribbon-cutting ceremony. After deciding the Neutral Planet is evil and deceptive, Zapp Brannigan captures and interrogates the crew, thinking that they are assassins. Shortly thereafter, he destroys the D.O.O.P. headquarters by attempting to use the Nimbus laser to cut the ribbon from space.\n\nAt the former D.O.O.P. headquarters in Weehawken, New Jersey, Brannigan is court-martialed for his actions. Seeing the lack of proper testimony being given, Leela takes the stand to expose Brannigan as \"the sorriest captain I've ever seen\", but under cross-examination, Brannigan attempts to discredit her by getting her to confess their one-night stand. After a very short deliberation, the jury finds Brannigan guilty. Brannigan then unjustly claims that it was mostly Kif Kroker's idea. Both are stripped of all their titles and dishonorably discharged from D.O.O.P. service. Unable to find employment, the pair wander the streets until they arrive at the Planet Express building. Leela tries to turn them away, but Professor Farnsworth decides hiring Brannigan would be good for the company's public image.\n\nThe augmented crew is sent to deliver pillows to a hotel on Stumbos 4, a high-gravity planet. Despite Leela's order to deliver one at a time, Fry, Bender, and Zapp decide to deliver all the pillows at once, which, in the intense gravity, causes the hover dolly to collapse. As punishment, Leela angrily demands that they deliver the pillows by hand instead of using the backup dolly, which causes resentment among the crew.\n\nFry, Bender, and Zapp stage a mutiny against Leela, and lock her in the laundry room. Brannigan decides to attack his imagined nemesis, the Neutral Planet, thinking this will make him a hero and get him reinstated as a D.O.O.P. captain. When Fry and Bender discover the plan is a suicide mission, they free Leela and she retakes command. With Fry and Bender's help, she foils Zapp's plan after he jumps ship with Kif.\n\nAfter returning to Earth, Leela testifies that Brannigan was an amazing hero, and D.O.O.P. reinstates Zapp and Kif, thus keeping them out of her life for a little while longer, since Kif annoys her with his complaints about working under Zapp. Leela also decides to be more lenient with Fry and Bender, but when the Professor overrules this, the three decide to stage a mutiny against him.\n\nContinuity\n\nThe majority of the jury at Brannigan's trial are characters from previous Futurama episodes. Among the familiar ones are: one half of Glurmo from \"Fry and the Slurm Factory\"; a Robot Elder from \"Fear of a Bot Planet\"; and Fry's Trisolian advisor Gorgak from \"My Three Suns\".\nWhile at the D.O.O.P. headquarters, Fry is shown talking to a woman from the planet \"Amazonia\". Fry and the rest of the Planet Express crew would later end up on Amazonia in \"Amazon Women in the Mood\".\nIn the cold opening, the 3-D chess game Bender and Fry play have the following characters as chess pieces: a Decapodian; a Horrible Gelatinous Blob; Lrrr the ruler of Omicron Persei 8; a Trisolian from \"My Three Suns\"; and an Amphibiosan.\nWhen Leela regains control of the ship as it is about to impact the Neutral Planet, she says \"I don't want to die at the age of 25!\". Bender questions this number.\nWhen attempting to explain to Fry what D.O.O.P. is, Hermes compares it to the Federation from Star Trek, even though it is later revealed in \"Where No Fan Has Gone Before\" that any verbal mention of Star Trek is an arrestable offense.\n\nCultural references\nThe title is a play on the Irish folk song \"Michael Finnigan\", which is also known by its refrain, \"Finnigan, begin again.\" The episode opens with Fry and Bender playing a game of chess similar to that played by Chewbacca and R2-D2 in Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope. The sequence where Zapp attempts to make a living as a gigolo is taken from Midnight Cowboy, including the film's theme, \"Everybody's Talkin'\" by Harry Nilsson.\n\nReception\nIn 2006, IGN.com ranked this episode as number five in their list of the \"Top 25 Futurama episodes\". The episode ranked highly in large part due to the character of Zapp Brannigan, particularly the Midnight Cowboy parody with Kif and Brannigan as Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight, respectively.In the site's 2019 reranking, several years after the show's first revival finished, \"Brannigan Begin Again\" only dropped to sixth. A review on 411mania also noted that the return of Brannigan was a highpoint of the episode and gave it an overall rating of 8.0/10 or \"very good\". In Doug Pratt's DVD Pratt noted that the episode combined the series' science fiction setting with good character humor. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+, stating, \"'Brannigan Begin Again' has some great gags, including what might be the lines from the series I quote most often. As oddly tensionless as the plot is, there\u2019s still enough spine to hold up some solid scenes, and Zapp remains reliably entertaining asshole. DOOP never becomes quite as important as it sounds like it should, but it counts as world-building, and the visit to the planet with extra-heavy gravity allows the opportunity for some excellent science-based humor.\"\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nBrannigan, Begin Again at The New York Times Movies\n\nFuturama (season 2) episodes\n1999 American television episodes", "machine_text": "Brannigan, Begin Again is the title of the seventeenth episode in the first season of the television series M*A*S*H.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Wuppertal Hauptbahnhof\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Wuppertal Hauptbahnhof (German for Wuppertal main station) is a railway station in the city of Wuppertal, just south of the Ruhr Area, in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia.  It is on the line between D\u00fcsseldorf/Cologne and Dortmund. The 1848 reception building is one of the oldest of its kind. The station was originally Elberfeld station and has been renamed several times since. Since 1992, it has been called Wuppertal Hauptbahnhof. Wuppertal Hauptbahnhof is also the site of lost luggage operations for Deutsche Bahn.\n\nHistory\n\nOn 3 September 1841, a few years after the opening of the first railway in Germany, the Dusseldorf-Elberfeld Railway Company (German: D\u00fcsseldorf-Elberfelder Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft, DEE) began operation of the D\u00fcsseldorf\u2013Elberfeld line from its D\u00fcsseldorf station to its Elberfeld station (now Wuppertal-Steinbeck station). It was the first steam-worked railway line in Western Germany and Prussia.\n\nThe Bergisch-M\u00e4rkische Railway Company (Bergisch-M\u00e4rkische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft, BME), opened its Elberfeld\u2013Dortmund railway from its Elberfeld station (known as D\u00f6ppersberg station) via Hagen to Dortmund to Schwelm on 9 October 1847. It was extended to Hagen and Dortmund on 20 December 1848. The BME took over the DEE in 1857.\n\nThe first provisional station building became inadequate within a few years. It was decided to build a new building, designed by Hauptner and Ebeling and opened in 1850 on a new section of line connecting the BME and DEE lines, which was completed on 9 March 1849. Around 1900, a protruding porch was built in front of the ground floor, which conflicted with the architectural design.  Nevertheless, this concept was maintained after its reconstruction after World War II.  \nThis will only change with the completion of the current renovation of the station/D\u00f6ppersberg area.\n\nThe station has been renamed several times. It was first called Elberfeld, but a few years later it was renamed Elberfeld-D\u00f6ppersberg and before the First World War it was renamed Elberfeld Hauptbahnhof. In the early 1930s the station's name was changed to Wuppertal-Elberfeld station as a consequence of the merger of the towns of Elberfeld and Barmen as the city of Wuppertal. Finally in 1992, it was renamed Wuppertal Hauptbahnhof.\n\nStation buildings\nThe station building is located next to platform track 1 and is connected by a tunnel to tracks 2\u20135. Above the entrance, near the old Reichsbahn railway division of Elberfeld, there are four pillars supporting the roof. The building is connected by the 200-metre-long D\u00f6ppersberg pedestrian tunnel directly with central Elberfeld and the Wuppertal Hbf (D\u00f6ppersberg) Schwebebahn (monorail) station.\n\nA McDonald's restaurant has been established in the premises of the former baggage check-in and in the tunnel under the entrance there a large newsagency/book shop and a bakery. The low building in front of the historic station building houses a pharmacy. In front of the entrance to the station there is a parking area, including a taxi stand, and nearby there is an Inter City Hotel.\n\nArchitecture\nThe original building is one of the oldest big city railway stations in Germany. It is a three-storey ashlar building bounded by tower-like corner projections. The main entrance in the middle of the building is a four-columned portico, with emphasised Corinthian capitals and has strong antique ornamentation. The ground floor originally had arched openings and it has six rectangular windows on each level and on each side of the portico. It was necessary in 1900 to build a ground-floor entrance porch to cater for the growing need for space for counters and waiting rooms.\n\nThe station is part of an ensemble of buildings built in neoclassical style, which is grouped around the railway station forecourt. On the western side of the square is the headquarters of the former Reichsbahn railway division of Elberfeld; on the eastern side there used to be the headquarters of the Chief General Manager, but thus was torn down after the Second World War.\n\nThe construction of the station was accompanied by extensive urban development in the D\u00f6ppersberg area. The D\u00f6ppersberg bridge (D\u00f6ppersberger Br\u00fccke) was built to connect centre of old Elberfeld with the station over the Wupper.\n\nReconstruction since 2014\nThe entire area around the station has been extensively reconstructed, finishing in 2018. The main goal was to create a continuous pedestrian and shopping area connecting the station to the city centre, as is already the case in many other German cities, such as Cologne, Stuttgart or Hanover. The B\u00a07 which is a very busy arterial road, was relocated to a tunnel, while a pedestrian zone was built above it.\n \nPreparations began in the summer of 2009, and the opening ceremony for work on the new, modernised station was held on 30 June 2009. Since the completion of the work in 2018, it has had a two-storey shopping level, a large station forecourt, which was built on the former Bahnhofstrasse, and a bridge and caf\u00e9 over the B\u00a07, which was lowered by about seven metres. A new bus station has replaced the bus stops that were previously on the B\u00a07. It was built above a 200-space car park next to the station. Instead of a glass cube\u2014which had previously been planned\u2014a striking building with a bronze-coloured facade was built, which contains a Primark branch.\n \nThe modernisation of the Deutsche Bahn entrance building at an expected cost of \u20ac12.4 million started in 2014. This modernisation was expected to be completed in 2016.\n \nIn the course of the renovation, bus services were temporarily relocated from the street of D\u00f6ppersberg to the districts of Ohligsm\u00fchle and Wall at the timetable change in July 2014. First D\u00f6ppersberg was lowered from the end of October 2012 and then the eastern part of the station lobby was demolished from the end of February 2013. The tenancies in this area\u2014pharmacy, pub, bank branch, bakery and fast food restaurant\u2014were terminated in autumn 2012 and they were closed. The DB Travel Center was temporarily located in a shipping container at the western end of platform 1.\n \nThe B\u00a07 was closed in July 2014 and the superstructure of the D\u00f6ppersberg bridge was removed in August 2014. The pedestrian tunnel ending there was closed in January 2015. Instead, a steel replacement pedestrian bridge crossed the B-7 construction site. This involved a 300-metre-long walk around the station building. The B\u00a07 was reopened to traffic in July 2017.\n \nA computer-based interlocking was put into operation in the Wuppertal area at the end of August 2017. This involved the installation of 387 sets of signals, 98 sets of points and 374 kilometres of cable. In addition, track and overhead line work was pending. The station was completely closed for work during the Easter and summer holidays in 2017. A total of 90 replacement buses were operated.\n \nThe restoration of the historic entrance building was originally the responsibility of Deutsche Bahn, which wanted to find a private investor to carry out the restoration and subsequent operation by the spring of 2019. Deutsche Bahn also planned to sell some land at the station on which various ancillary buildings now stand to the municipal utility company, which intended to build the valley station of the planned Wuppertal cable car there. However, this project was abandoned after 61.6% of the participants voted against it in a citizens' poll on 26 May 2019. According to its own statement, Deutsche Bahn is in talks with \"multiple interests\". The selection process was stopped in the meantime to await the results of the citizens' survey and will continue after the decision of the town council to end the cable car project. However, it was not to be expected that the sale would be concluded in 2019.\n \n\n \nA public piano has been located in the station hall since November 2018.\n\nServices\nAlthough the station possesses only five tracks, less than the other stations of the city, all services running through Wuppertal stop here, except for the S 68 S-Bahn service terminating in Vohwinkel.\n\nLong-distance trains stop every 30 minutes on platforms 1 and 2 running in either direction. ICE line 10 (Cologne\u2013Berlin) provides a direct connection to Berlin in under four hours.\n\nLong distance trains\nThe following services currently call at Wuppertal Hauptbahnhof:\n\nRegional and S-Bahn trains\nThe following Regional-Express, Regionalbahn and S-Bahn services call at Wuppertal Hbf:\n\nThe Wuppertal Suspension Railway () has a stop nearby.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nRailway stations in Wuppertal\nMonorail stations\nRailway stations in Germany opened in 1850\nRhine-Ruhr S-Bahn stations\nS7 (Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn)\nS8 (Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn)\nS9 (Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn)\nWuppertal Schwebebahn\n1850 establishments in Prussia\nNeoclassical architecture in Germany", "machine_text": "Wuppertal Hauptbahnhof is a train station located in the city of Wuppertal, Germany.

Other hills in the chain included Mont Saint-Bruno, Mont Saint-Hilaire, Mont Saint-Gr\u00e9goire, Mont Rougemont, Mont Yamaska, Mont Shefford, and Mont Brome.\n\nIt was only later that Mont M\u00e9gantic, the Oka Hills, as well as the Saint-Andr\u00e9 and d'Iberville formations, were added to the list.\n\nGeology\nEach hill in the chain consists of an erosional remnant of Cretaceous intrusive igneous rock and associated hornfels, which are more resistant to weathering than the surrounding sedimentary rock. All of the hills have dark-coloured mafic rock such as gabbro and essexite; some also have large areas of pulaskite, syenite, and other light-coloured rock.\n\nThe Monteregian Hills are part of the Great Meteor hotspot track, formed as a result of the North American Plate sliding westward over the long-lived New England hotspot, and are the eroded remnants of intrusive stocks. These intrusive stocks have been variously interpreted as the feeder intrusions of long extinct volcanoes, which would have been active about 125 million years ago, or as intrusives that never breached the surface in volcanic activity. The lack of an obvious track west of the Monteregian Hills may be due either to failure of the plume to penetrate the Canadian Shield, to the lack of recognizable intrusions, or to strengthening of the plume when it approached the Monteregian Hills region. However, there is evidence the hotspot track extends northwestwards, including epeirogenic uplift, mantle velocity anomalies and kimberlitic volcanic features (e.g. the Attawapiskat, Kirkland Lake and Lake Timiskaming kimberlite fields) that become older away from the Monteregian Hills.\n\nThe shallow, rocky sandy loam soils of the summits are mostly covered in forest. Where the underlying rock is rich in olivine, as over large areas of Mont Saint-Bruno and Mont Rougemont, these soils are classed as dystric brunisol. Podzol tends to develop over rock which lacks olivine, although many of these podzols lack an eluvial (Ae) horizon. Lower slopes are covered with aprons of gravel or sand. The sandy soils are usually podzols with classic Ae development; they often have subsoil hardpan and are undesirable for agriculture. The free-draining gravels are preferred for apple orchards, which grow in thermal belts where cold air can drain to the valley floor.\n\nGallery\n\nSee also\nVolcanism of Canada\nVolcanism of Eastern Canada\n\nExternal links\n\n  Les collines mont\u00e9r\u00e9giennes Geologic information about the chain\n\nReferences\n\nMountain ranges of Quebec\nMountains of Quebec\nCretaceous volcanism\nIgneous petrology of Quebec\nLandforms of Mont\u00e9r\u00e9gie", "machine_text": "Monteregian Hills are a group of isolated small mountains located in the western part of the province of Quebec, Canada.

These hills are exceptional for their geological composition and their significant impact on the landscape of the region. Mont Saint-Bruno is located in the town of Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville, approximately 25 km from Montreal. It is a popular park for hiking and is also home to a variety of flora and fauna. Mont Saint-Hilaire is located in the city of Saint-Hilaire, and its summit is known as la Tour du Pain. In 1958, Mont Saint-Hilaire and its surroundings were declared a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO. Mont Saint-Gr\u00e9goire is located in the town of Mont-Saint-Gr\u00e9goire and is a popular destination for viewing fall foliage. Mont Rougemont is located in the town of Rougemont and has a unique elliptical shape, while Mont Yamaska is located in the town of Saint-Paul-d'Abbotsford. The hills have played a significant role in the history of the region. They were used as landmarks by Indigenous peoples, and later, as landmarks by early European explorers. The hills are also significant for their contribution to the agricultural landscape of the area.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Corruption in local government\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Because there are many factors that can lead to corruption in local government, it is hard to study corruption patterns empirically, but recently, improved research strategies and information sources have made such studies better.\n\nTypes\nThere are several types of political corruption that occur in local government. Some are more common than others, and some are more prevalent to local governments than to larger segments of government. Local governments may be more susceptible to corruption because interactions between private individuals and officials happen at greater levels of intimacy and with more frequency at more decentralized levels. Forms of corruption pertaining to money like bribery, extortion, embezzlement, and graft are found in local government systems. Other forms of political corruption are nepotism and patronage systems. One historical example was the Black Horse Cavalry a group of New York state legislators accused of blackmailing corporations.\n \n Bribery is the offering of something which is most often money but can also be goods or services in order to gain an unfair advantage. Common advantages can be to sway a person's opinion, action, or decision, reduce amounts fees collected, speed up a government grants, or change outcomes of legal processes. \n Extortion is threatening or inflicting harm to a person, their reputation, or their property in order to unjustly obtain money, actions, services, or other goods from that person. Blackmail is a form of extortion.\n Embezzlement is the illegal taking or appropriation of money or property that has been entrusted to a person but is actually owned by another. In political terms this is called graft which is when a political office holder unlawfully uses public funds for personal purposes.\n Nepotism is the practice or inclination to favor a group or person who is a relative when giving promotions, jobs, raises, and other benefits to employees. This is often based on the concept of familism which is believing that a person must always respect and favor family in all situations including those pertaining to politics and business. This leads some political officials to give privileges and positions of authority to relatives based on relationships and regardless of their actual abilities.\n Patronage systems consist of the granting favors, contracts, or appointments to positions by a local public office holder or candidate for a political office in return for political support. Many times patronage is used to gain support and votes in elections or in passing legislation. Patronage systems disregard the formal rules of a local government and use personal instead of formalized channels to gain an advantage.\n\nDemographic factors\n\nSocioeconomic characteristics and the size of the population of people that make up a municipality can be encouraging factors for local government officials to engage in corrupt practices. Patterns of political corruption can be found in places that have a similar demographic make-up. Demographic factors that have been known to lead to or increase the likelihood of corruption in a local government system are religion, race, class, size of the municipality, local economic conditions, education, political culture, and gender. Some factors are interrelated or can lead to other factors which may cause more corruption.\n\nSize of a municipality\nSmaller municipalities may be more prone to experience corruption within their local government. These towns and villages nominate (or self-nominate) residents or officials to represent and run the local government, sometimes without oversight approval from higher levels of government. In a small community, personal opinions and relationships play a larger role in politics. Due to this, problems like nepotism or extortion can be prevalent. In addition, some local governments face another kind of disadvantage - lack of experience and professionalism from their representatives. It can be a challenge to attract qualified up and coming politicians to small towns. Another major issue in small municipalities lies with accountability - some have inadequate or insufficient structures for policing and prosecution of corrupt local officials, culminating in a difficult situation for those affected.\n\nCondition of the local economy\nLow economic development has been found to be an encouraging factor for political corruption. Economic practices like dependence on raw material industries and drug trades are characteristic of poorer cities and areas with increased amounts of corruption. Economic dependence on certain industries will also lead to less stable governments and less money available to fund governments. Fragile economies lead to increased levels of poverty and less opportunities to get out of poverty. Poverty is a known factor that encourages corruption in local governments. Places with failing economies and poverty sometimes get loans or start aid programs to support the local economy and the people, and public officials are often able to unlawfully take the money or goods for private gain. With less money available, local officials are more likely to get lower wages, which is seen as another factor that leads to corruption. Officials who get lower wages, which are not enough to provide for their necessities, will many times become corrupt and try something like embezzling money that may entrusted to them in the local treasury. Low wages can cause economic insecurity and encourage politicians to take advantage of current opportunities as public figures of authority. On the other hand, some researchers argue that the more money a local government has to spend, the more tendency it will have to do so inefficiently, which can lead to suspicions of corruption. Overall, poorer municipalities are more often perceived to have corrupt local governments than rich ones.\n\nEducation\nLower levels of education which are often caused by poverty are seen as a factor which encourages corrupt government practices. Those with less education are not as informed as to how the government works or what rights they have under the government. It is easier for corrupt office-holders to conceal corrupt activities from a poorly educated public. Uneducated citizens are less likely to be aware of corruption in local governments or how to stop it, and therefore, corruption is able to remain and spread. Without some kind of political awareness, citizens will not know which candidates to elect that are honest or dishonest or other ways to prevent corruption from taking place in their local governments. This often leads municipalities to be continually governed by one or more corrupt local officials who use patronage or nepotistic practices to stay in office or keep influence in the government for long periods of time. When local political leaders are less educated, they will be less likely to find legitimate ways to make the municipality well-structured, productive, and successful.\n\nPolitical culture of municipality\nMany local governments have an established political culture with certain expectations and practices that often determine what is seen as acceptable and not acceptable in local politics. In municipalities with an undeveloped or underdeveloped political culture, accountability and legitimacy is usually low and principles of ethics in government are not established. This can encourage corruption to take hold in the local government because citizens do not know what is considered corrupt, and local officials are not afraid to be corrupt because of the low accountability.In some places the local governments have been corrupt for so long that the citizens think that is how it is supposed to work because that is all they have been exposed to. Long periods of political instability will also lead to corruption in the government because people are unsure of how the government should operate, and thus do not know what practices are corrupt or how to stop them if they are corrupt.\n\nLinks and references\n\nAcademic references\n\n The Causes of Corruption: A Cross-National Study, Daniel Treisman, Department of Political Science, University of California\n Consequences and Causes of Corruption \u2013 What do We Know from a Cross-Section of Countries?, Johann Graf Lambsdorff\n A Handbook on Fighting Corruption, CENTER FOR DEMOCRACY AND GOVERNANCE, U.S. Agency for International Development\n\nWeb references\n Corruption and Development, CHERYL W.

It can take many forms, including bribery, kickbacks, nepotism, cronyism, and embezzlement of public funds. Corruption in local government can have serious consequences, including reduced public trust in government, decreased efficiency and effectiveness of government services, and negative impacts on economic growth and development. One of the most common forms of corruption in local government is bribery. This can occur when individuals or companies seek favors or preferential treatment from local officials. For example, developers may bribe local officials to obtain permits for construction projects, or businesses may bribe local officials to obtain contracts for government services. Nepotism and cronyism are also forms of corruption in local government. These occur when officials hire or promote family members or friends, rather than for merit or qualifications. This can result in less capable and less qualified individuals holding important public positions, which can negatively impact the quality of public services. Embezzlement of public funds is another form of corruption in local government. This can occur when officials use public funds for personal gain, such as to purchase luxury items or fund personal projects. This leads to a loss of public resources that could have been used for public services and infrastructure projects. Corruption in local government can be difficult to detect and address due to its covert nature. However, there are steps that can be taken to prevent corruption, including increased transparency and accountability in government operations, stronger anti-corruption laws and penalties, and active citizen engagement in monitoring and reporting corrupt activities. In conclusion, corruption in local government is a serious issue that undermines the integrity and credibility of local government institutions. It is important for government officials, citizens, and other stakeholders to work together to prevent and address corruption in all its forms. Only through sustained efforts to combat corruption can local governments ensure that they serve the best interests of their constituents and promote sustainable economic and social development.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 3350312}

Greece. Nicolas Kitsikis was full professor and rector of the National Technical University of Athens (Athens Polytechnic School)  and had served as General\u00a0 Director of Public Works in the government of Eleftherios Venizelos, 1917\u20131920.\u00a0At the time of her birth, he was a technical director for the British company MacAlpine and had, among other projects, built the harbour of Heraklion, Crete.\n\nBeata\u00a0Petychakis, born July 14, 1907, in Heraklion, Crete, was the daughter of Emanuel Petychakis, a Cretan Greek, doing business in Egypt. Beata Petychakis\u00a0married Nicolas Kitsikis at 16 and moved to Athens where Panagopoulos was born. Panagopoulos grew\u00a0up in various places, in central Athens,\u00a0in the suburb of Ekali and eventually, in the neighborhood called Kolonaki.\n\nPanagopoulos finished high school in 1943. During the next two years she studied architecture at the National Technical University of Athens, and archeology at the School of Philosophy, University of Athens (UoA). In February 1947, Panagopoulos left Greece for the United States, where she had received a scholarship to the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago. There she completed both her Bachelor\u2019s degree and Master\u2019s degree in the field of Medieval Art History under Professor Ulrich Middeldorf.\n\nLater life, teaching, and further education \nAt the University of Chicago, she met a doctoral student, Epaminondas Petros Panagopoulos, (Nondas). They subsequently married and had two children. The family moved first to Detroit, Michigan, where Nondas began teaching at Wayne State University. In 1956, the family moved to San Jose, California, where Nondas taught American History at San Jose State University (SJSU). During this period of time she and Nondas co-authored\u00a0the sections on \u201cModern Culture\u201d in the chapter on \u201cGreece\u201d in the 1958 edition of the Encyclopedia Americana.\n\nPanagopoulos earned teaching certificates in Art and French and began teaching at Fremont High School, Sunnyvale. In 1961, she began teaching Art History at Foothill College. In 1962, she was accepted at Stanford University in the Art History PhD program, but transferred to the University of California, Berkeley\u2019s Art History Department in 1964. Completing her dissertation at the Sorbonne in Paris, she received her PhD in 1970. From then on, she taught at SJSU until 1988.[1]\n\nDuring this time she was appointed Kress Professor of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, Greece and concurrently served three years as director of the Gennadius Library.\n\nThe 1970s, teaching and writing about the humanities \n\nTwo major experiences in the 1970\u2019s contributed to the development of Panagopoulos\u2019 teaching philosophy which emphasized the importance of a humanities education. First, at SJSU, she became a professor in the innovative educational four-year program called New College, an intensive study program based on small seminars, exploring important themes of modern life.\n\nThe second illustration was Panagopoulos\u2019 tour of China in 1975. This was a tour for educators led by the Chinese government and was part of Mao Zedong\u2019s first efforts to show China to the world. Panagopoulos\u2019 response was enthusiastic and resulted in an article in the UCLA Educator 1976, entitled: On Creativity in the People\u2019s Republic of China, An Art Historian\u2019s Perspective. and in the content of her course on Women and Art at New College\n\nMajor work: Frankish monastic architecture in Greece \nIn 1979, Panagopoulos\u2019 book Cistercian and Mendicant Monasteries in Medieval Greece was published by the University of Chicago Press:\nThis is the only comprehensive study of the most outstanding extant Gothic monasteries built during the French and Italian occupancy of Greece after the conquest of Constantinople in 1204 CE.-- Walter Horn, University of California, Berkeley\nIn Cistercian and Mendicant Monasteries in Medieval Greece, Panagopoulos examined\u00a0the development of  Latin ecclesiastical architecture in Greece. She provided new data, including photographs and drawings. In the past this subject area had been too difficult for medievalists and art historians to access. Google Scholar provides citations to 43 scholars that have in turn referred to this work.\n\nKress Professor and director of the Gennadius Library \nIn 1982, Panagopoulos was awarded the position of Kress Professor at the American School of Classical Studies in Athens (ASCSA) and in July 1983, was made\u00a0the director of the American School\u2019s Gennadius Library,\u00a0a collection of Greek history, literature and art from antiquity to modern times and part of the ASCSA. This was a notable appointment since the library had not had a director since 1977. She served in this position until July 1986. During her watch, the Gennadius Library\u00a0opened for additional hours and two evenings a week leading to a substantial increase in the number of people using the library. The physical structure of the library was remodeled. A new\u00a0exhibition room and a section for archival research were added to the building.\n\nUnder Panagopoulos\u2019 leadership the following of the library increased substantially.\u00a0The\u00a0monthly\u00a0 lectures, chamber music concerts and exhibits grew in popularity. The library had an exhibit on the literary activities in Thessaloniki, another on the treasures of Mt. Sinai and the Patriarchate of Alexandria and a third on the achievements of the American School of Classical Studies in Athens. In 1985 Athens was selected as the European Capital of Culture and the Gennadius Library fully participated in events throughout the year. The library was part of five exhibitions and in addition contributed substantially to a television program on the life of Joannes Gennadius.\n\nTurco-Baroque domestic architecture \nDuring the late 1970s and early 1980s, Panagopoulos did her own research and synthesized fragmented studies\u00a0surrounding certain large mansions (Greek: \u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac) built in Greece and the remaining Balkans between 1700 and 1900. Her work recognized\u00a0as an emerging class\u00a0the owners of these mansions who were merchants dealing in products\u2014leather, wax, fabrics\u2014from the Ottoman Empire for sale in lucrative European markets like Madrid, Vienna and Venice. This class of merchants was secure in their language and their religion but did not have fixed commitments as to their ethnicity. They would leave at the beginning of\u00a0 spring and return home\u00a0at the beginning of\u00a0 the winter.\u00a0Slowly they became rich and built homes using itinerant builders mostly from Greece\u2019s Epirus and western Macedonia regions.\n\nAwards \nIn 1982 Panagopoulos received, in Greece, the Academy of Athens annual award for the humanities. In addition, in the United States, in 1992, she received the Hellenic American Professional Society of California's  Axion Award.\n\nPersonal \nPanagopoulos\u2019 husband of 48 years was Epaminondas Petros Panagopoulos. They had two children. Panagopoulos\u00a0retired in 1988 from SJSU and has spent the remaining years living in San Francisco and traveling frequently.\n\nPublications \nPanagopoulos, Beata Kitsikis (1979).

Bond discovers that Goldfinger's ultimate plan is to destroy the economy of the United States by irradiating the gold in Fort Knox, rendering it useless. Many elements of the novel have become iconic, including Goldfinger's henchman, Oddjob, who wields a lethal metal-rimmed hat, and the novel's opening sequence, which sees Bond playing a round of golf against Goldfinger.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Petition to the King\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Petition to the King was a petition sent to King George III by the First Continental Congress in 1774, calling for repeal of the Intolerable Acts.\n\nPolitical background\nFollowing the end of the French and Indian War (the North American theater of the Seven Years' War) in 1763, relations between the colonies and Britain had been deteriorating. Because the war had plunged the British government deep into debt, Parliament enacted a series of measures to increase tax revenue from the colonies. These acts, such as the Stamp Act of 1765 and the Townshend Acts of 1767, were seen as legitimate means of collecting revenues to pay off the nearly two-fold increase in British debt stemming from the war.\n\nMany colonists in the Americas, however, developed a different conception of their role within the British Empire. In particular, because the colonies were not directly represented in Parliament, colonists argued that Parliament had no right to levy taxes upon them. After colonists destroyed thousands of pounds of British-taxed tea during the Boston Tea Party, Parliament passed the Coercive Acts in 1774, punishing the colonies for their actions. These punitive Acts were vehemently opposed by the colonists, leading the newly formed Continental Congress to seek redress with King George III, in an attempt to reach a common understanding.\n\nDevelopment of the document\n\nConception\n\nOn October 1, 1774, in response to the deteriorating relationship between the American Colonies and Britain, the First Continental Congress decided to prepare a statement to King George III of Great Britain. The goal of the address was to persuade the King to revoke unpopular policies such as the Coercive Acts, which were imposed on the Colonies by the British Parliament. The committee appointed to prepare the Address consisted of Richard Henry Lee, John Adams, Thomas Johnson, Patrick Henry, and John Rutledge, with Lee designated as the committee chairman.\n\nOn October 5, 1774, Congress once more returned to the subject of the Address, stressing to the committee that the document should assure the King that following the successful repeal of the Coercive Acts, the Colonies would restore favorable relations with Britain.\n\nApproval by Congress\n\nOn October 25, 1774, the petition came before Congress in its draft form. After the document was debated over and formally amended, it was then approved to be engrossed and sent to England to be presented to the King.\n\nAnnotated text of the petition\nThe petition, when written, was not divided into formal parts. However, the structure of the document allows it to be classified into sections, including an introduction, the list of grievances, reasons for attention, and a conclusion.\n\nDelivery of the document\nOn November 2, the petition departed Philadelphia on board the ship Britannia, captained by W. Morwick. However, a storm forced the ship to return to port, delaying the delivery of the petition. It was later discovered that the paper was unfit to be presented. The second copy left port on November 6 on board the ship Mary and Elizabeth, captained by N. Falconer. It was confirmed on November 14 that the document successfully arrived in London.\n\nIn Britain, a number of London merchants expressed interest in joining the Americans when the petition was presented, although Benjamin Franklin advised against the proposition. On December 21, Benjamin Franklin, Lee, and Bollan were notified by Lord Dartmouth that the petition was \"decent and respectful\" and that it would be presented as soon as possible to the Houses of Parliament. However, Franklin wrote two days later that the petition could not be presented to Parliament until after the Christmas recess.\n\nResponse\nOn January 19, 1775, the petition was presented to the House of Commons by Lord North, and was also presented to the House of Lords the following day.\n\nBecause the petition was intermingled with many other documents, and given the increasing turmoil of the times, little attention was given to the petition by Parliament. Likewise, the King never gave the Colonies a formal reply to their petition.\n\nPublication\nWhen the official papers of Congress were published in October and November 1774, the Petition to the King was omitted, because it was preferred that the address be read by the King before being made public. It was not until January 17 or 18, 1775 that the papers were officially released by Charles Thomson, for publication.\n\nSurviving drafts\nThree drafts of the Petition to the King survive to this day: one written by Patrick Henry, one written by Richard Henry Lee, and one by John Dickinson.\n\nPatrick Henry\nThe Henry draft is written with very few corrections on its four portfolio pages. Compared to the final version of the Address, the draft contains more rhetorical descriptions of the contested Acts, and focuses less on the Colonies' past loyalty to Britain.\n\nRichard Henry Lee\nThe Lee draft is neatly written, with minor changes, on three portfolio pages. Compared to the Henry draft, the descriptions of the grievances were brief. It does contain, however, a harsh attack on the King's ministers, most notably Bute, Mansfield, and North. Because of the inflammatory language in this draft, it is argued that this is the version that was rejected by Congress on October 21, 1774.\n\nJohn Dickinson\nThe Dickinson draft is a rough composition, rite with many changes, including entire paragraphs designated to be transposed. The document is nine and a half portfolio pages, numbered 1-9 and 12, with pages 10 and 11 left blank. The text found in this draft is virtually identical to the document adopted by Congress, with the main difference lying in the list of grievances in the adopted version, which resembled those found in the other two drafts.\n\nHistorical significance\nThe Petition to the King reflected the Colonies' desire to maintain relations with Britain, given that certain demands were met. In particular, it showed that the Colonies viewed themselves as loyal to the British monarchy rather than to Parliament.\n\nSee also\n Founding Fathers of the United States\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\n1774 in the Thirteen Colonies\nOrdinances of the Continental Congress\nDocuments of the American Revolution\nPetitions\n1774 in international relations\nGeorge III of the United Kingdom\n1774 documents", "machine_text": "Petition to the King is a formal request made through a written document addressed to a monarch or sovereign, seeking the redressal of grievances or the granting of a specific envoy. Petitions to the king played an essential role in the governance of monarchies throughout history, especially when the ruler exercised intense power over the state. In the British Royal court, the Petition to the King was believed to be one of the three traditional ways in which the king made laws. The practice of presenting a formal request to the monarch dates back to the Magna Carta, and over time, it became an established process of governmental consultation between the king and his subjects. In the medieval period, Petitions to the King were primarily used by the landed gentry, merchants, and guilds to protect/reinforce their rights and properties from arbitrary laws and confiscation by the monarch. As the power of the monarch gradually reduced, the availability of other alternatives for airing grievances reduced the frequency of petitions. During the Stuart period, especially under James I and Charles I, petitions to the king became increasingly political in nature, calling for the maintenance of liberties and constitutional rights. The use of Petitions to the King became an important tool of opposition to the ruling monarchs in the seventeenth century. In the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, the use of Petitions to the King declined massively as more parliamentary alternatives replaced it. The Petition of Right (1628) and the Bill of Rights (1689) were significant factors that shifted the centre of power from king to parliament. However, the right of subjects to petition the monarch remains in place in Britain to date. In conclusion, while Petitions to the King were initially crucial in preserving the rights of the subjects, many of the rights that people once petitioned for aren't necessarily relevant today. Nonetheless, the right of British subjects to petition Her Majesty the Queen stands as a vital part of the country's constitutional practice.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 17243383}

The term is often used to describe cities that are highly congested, polluted, and where standards of living are below average. The term Pig City can be traced back to the early 1900s when urbanization in the United States was on the rise. Cities were growing at an unprecedented rate, and as a result, the quality of life for urban residents began to decline. Issues such as congestion, pollution, and the spread of diseases were common in urban areas during this time. Over time, the term Pig City has gained widespread use and is now used to describe urban regions around the world that are struggling with issues of overpopulation, poverty, pollution, and other related challenges. The term has been used in several books, films, and other media to describe the negative aspects of urbanization. For example, in the 1984 film \"Repo Man,\" the protagonist refers to Los Angeles as a Pig City. While Pig City is often used to describe the negative aspects of urbanization, many cities have made significant strides to improve living conditions for their residents. Urban planning, environmental regulations, and social programs have all played a role in improving the quality of life in cities around the world.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Ice cream\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Ice cream is a sweetened frozen food typically eaten as a snack or dessert. It may be made from milk or cream and is flavoured with a sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and a spice, such as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit such as strawberries or peaches. It can also be made by whisking a flavored cream base and liquid nitrogen together.  Food coloring is sometimes added, in addition to stabilizers. The mixture is cooled below the freezing point of water and  stirred to incorporate air spaces and to prevent detectable ice crystals from forming. The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures (below ). It becomes more malleable as its temperature increases.\n\nThe meaning of the name \"ice cream\" varies from one country to another.\n Ice cream and gelato, based on cream and milk.\n Frozen yogurt, based on yogurt or kefir.\n Frozen custard, with eggs added to cream and sugar.\n Ice milk.\n Sorbet/slushy, ice pop/popsicle/icicle: Water base. Examples: frozen cola, frozen lemonade, frozen tea.\n Sherbet, like sorbet but with some milk added.\n\nIn some countries, such as the United States, \"ice cream\" applies only to a specific variety, and most governments regulate the commercial use of the various terms according to the relative quantities of the main ingredients, notably the amount of cream. Products that do not meet the criteria to be called ice cream are sometimes labelled \"frozen dairy dessert\" instead. In other countries, such as Italy and Argentina, one word is used for all variants. Analogues made from dairy alternatives, such as goat's or sheep's milk, or milk substitutes (e.g., soy, cashew, coconut,  almond milk or tofu), are available for those who are lactose intolerant, allergic to dairy protein, or vegan.\n\nIce cream may be served in dishes, for eating with a spoon, or licked from edible wafer cones. Ice cream may be served with other desserts, such as apple pie, or as an ingredient in ice cream floats, sundaes, milkshakes, ice cream cakes and even baked items, such as Baked Alaska.\n\nHistory\n\nOrigins\nThe origins of frozen desserts are obscure although several accounts exist about their history.\nSome sources describe ice cream-like foods as originating in Persia as far back as 550 BCE while others claim that the Roman Emperor Nero had ice collected from the Apennine Mountains to produce the first sorbet mixed with honey and wine. Although sorbets are believed to have been invented in Persia, other accounts say ice cream originated in the Mongol Empire and first spread to China during its expansion.\n\nIts spread throughout Europe is sometimes attributed to Arab traders, but more often to Marco Polo. Though it's not mentioned in any of his writings, Polo is often credited with introducing sorbet-style desserts to Italy after learning of it during his travels to China. The Italian duchess Catherine de' Medici is said to have introduced flavored sorbet ices to France when she brought some Italian chefs with her to France upon marrying the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans (Henry II of France) in 1533. One hundred years later, Charles I of England was reportedly so impressed by the \"frozen snow\" that he offered his own ice cream maker a lifetime pension in return for keeping the formula secret, so that ice cream could be a royal prerogative. There is no evidence to support any of these legends.\n\nSnow was used to cool drinks in Greece around 500 BC and Hippocrates is known to have criticized chilled drinks for causing \"fluxes of the stomach\". Snow collected from the lower slopes of mountains was unsanitary and iced drinks were believed to cause convulsions, colic and a host of other ailments. Seneca criticized the extravagant costs associated with iced desserts in an era without refrigeration.\n\nDespite this, ice and snow were prized ingredients in ancient cuisines including Japanese, Chinese, Greek and Roman cuisines. Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs show a snow-filled vessel next to fruit juice. There are Tang dynasty records of a chilled dessert made with flour, camphor and water buffalo milk and recipes for snow-chilled sweets are included in a 1st-century Roman recipe book. There are Persian records from the 2nd century AD for sweetened chilled drinks with ice made by freezing water in the desert at night.\n\nIce cream was made possible only by the discovery of the endothermic effect. Prior to this, cream could only be chilled but not frozen. It was the addition of salt, that lowered the melting point of ice, which had the effect of drawing heat from the cream and allowing it to freeze. The first known record of this comes from the Indian poem Pancatantra, dating to the 4th century AD. The earliest written description of the process is known not from culinary texts, but the 13th-century writings of Ibn Abu Usaybia concerning medicine. The technique of \"freezing\" is not known from any European sources prior to the 16th century.\n\nSouth Asia \n\nIn the sixteenth century, the Mughal Empire used relays of horsemen to bring ice from the Hindu Kush to its capital Delhi. The ice was used in fruit sorbets. It was also used to create kulfi, a popular frozen dairy dessert from the Indian subcontinent often described as \"traditional Indian ice cream.\"\n\nEurope \n\nThe first recipe in French for flavoured ices appears in 1674, in Nicholas Lemery's Recueil de curiosit\u00e9z rares et nouvelles de plus admirables effets de la nature. Recipes for sorbetti saw publication in the 1694 edition of Antonio Latini's Lo Scalco alla Moderna (The Modern Steward). Recipes for flavoured ices begin to appear in Fran\u00e7ois Massialot's Nouvelle Instruction pour les Confitures, les Liqueurs, et les Fruits, starting with the 1692 edition. Massialot's recipes result in a coarse, pebbly texture. Latini claims that the results of his recipes should have the fine consistency of sugar and snow.\n\nIce cream recipes first appeared in England in the 18th century. The recipe for ice cream was published in Mrs. Mary Eales's Receipts in London in 1718.\n\nTo ice cream.\n\nTake Tin Ice-Pots, fill them with any Sort of Cream you like, either plain or sweeten\u2019d, or Fruit in it; shut your Pots very close; to six Pots you must allow eighteen or twenty Pound of Ice, breaking the Ice very small; there will be some great Pieces, which lay at the Bottom and Top: You must have a Pail, and lay some Straw at the Bottom; then lay in your Ice, and put in amongst it a Pound of Bay-Salt; set in your Pots of Cream, and  lay Ice and Salt between every Pot, that they may not touch; but the Ice must lie round them on every Side; lay a good deal of Ice on the Top, cover the Pail with Straw, set it in a Cellar where no Sun or Light comes, it will be froze in four Hours, but it may stand longer; then take it out just as you use it; hold it in your Hand and it will slip out. When you wou\u2019d freeze any Sort of Fruit, either Cherries, Raspberries, Currants, or Strawberries, fill your Tin-Pots with the Fruit, but as hollow as you can; put to them Lemmonade, made with Spring-Water and Lemmon-Juice sweeten\u2019d; put enough in the Pots to make the Fruit hang together, and put them in Ice as you do Cream.\n\nThe 1751 edition of The Art of Cookery made Plain and Easy by Hannah Glasse includes a recipe for ice cream: \"H. GLASSE Art of Cookery (ed. 4) 333 (heading) To make Ice Cream..set it [sc. the cream] into the larger Bason. Fill it with Ice, and a Handful of Salt.\"\n\nThe year 1768 saw the publication of L'Art de Bien Faire les Glaces d'Office by M. Emy, a cookbook devoted entirely to recipes for flavoured ices and ice cream.\n\nNorth America \n\nAn early North American reference to ice cream is from 1744: \"Among the rarities..was some fine ice cream, which, with the strawberries and milk, eat most deliciously.\"\n\nQuaker colonists introduced ice cream to the United States, bringing their ice cream recipes with them. Confectioners sold ice cream at their shops in New York and other cities during the colonial era. Ben Franklin, George Washington, and Thomas Jefferson were known to have regularly eaten and served ice cream. Records, kept by a merchant from Catham street, New York, show George Washington spending approximately $200 on ice cream in the summer of 1790. The same records show president Thomas Jefferson having an 18-step recipe for ice cream. First Lady Dolley Madison, wife of U.S. President James Madison, served ice cream at her husband's Inaugural Ball in 1813.\n\nSmall-scale hand-cranked ice cream freezers were invented in England by Agnes Marshall and in America by Nancy Johnson in the 1840s.\n\nThe most popular flavours of ice cream in North America (based on consumer surveys) are vanilla and chocolate.\n\nExpansion in popularity \nIn the Mediterranean, ice cream appears to have been accessible to ordinary people by the mid-eighteenth century. Ice cream became popular and inexpensive in England in the mid-nineteenth century, when Swiss \u00e9migr\u00e9 Carlo Gatti set up the first stand outside Charing Cross station in 1851. He sold scoops in shells for one penny. Prior to this, ice cream was an expensive treat confined to those with access to an ice house. Gatti built an 'ice well' to store ice that he cut from Regent's Canal under a contract with the Regent's Canal Company. By 1860, he expanded the business and began importing ice on a large scale from Norway.\n\nIn New Zealand, a newspaper advertisement for ice cream appeared in 1866, claiming to be the first time ice cream was available in Wellington. Commercial manufacturing was underway in 1875. Ice cream rapidly gained in popularity in New Zealand throughout the 20th century. By 2018, exported ice cream products included new flavors such as \u201cmatcha\u201d to cater specifically to Asian markets.\n\nAgnes Marshall, regarded as the \"queen of ices\" in England, did much to popularize ice cream recipes and make its consumption into a fashionable middle-class pursuit. She wrote four books:  The Book of Ices (1885), Mrs. A.B. Marshall's Book of Cookery (1888), Mrs. A.B. Marshall's Larger Cookery Book of Extra Recipes (1891) and Fancy Ices (1894) and gave public lectures on cooking. She even suggested using liquid nitrogen to make ice cream.\n\nIce cream soda was invented in the 1870s, adding to ice cream's popularity. The invention of this cold treat is attributed to American Robert Green in 1874, although there is no conclusive evidence to prove his claim. The ice cream sundae originated in the late 19th century. Several men claimed to have created the first sundae, but there is no conclusive evidence to support any of their stories. Some sources say that the sundae was invented to circumvent blue laws, which forbade serving sodas on Sunday. Towns claiming to be the birthplace of the sundae include Buffalo, Two Rivers, Ithaca, and Evanston. Both the ice cream cone and banana split became popular in the early 20th century.\n\nThe first mention of the cone being used as an edible receptacle for the ice cream is in Mrs. A.B. Marshall's Book of Cookery of 1888. Her recipe for \"Cornet with Cream\" said that \"the cornets were made with almonds and baked in the oven, not pressed between irons\". The ice cream cone was popularized in the US at the 1904 World's Fair in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nThe history of ice cream in the 20th century is one of great change and increases in availability and popularity. In the United States in the early 20th century, the ice cream soda was a popular treat at the soda shop, the soda fountain, and the ice cream parlor. During the American Prohibition, the soda fountain to some extent replaced the outlawed alcohol establishments such as bars and saloons.\n\nIce cream became popular throughout the world in the second half of the 20th century after cheap refrigeration became common. There was an explosion of ice cream stores and of flavours and types. Vendors often competed on the basis of variety: Howard Johnson's restaurants advertised \"a world of 28 flavors\", and Baskin-Robbins made its 31 flavors (\"one for every day of the month\") the cornerstone of its marketing strategy (the company now boasts that it has developed over 1000 varieties).\n\nOne important development in the 20th century was the introduction of soft ice cream, which has more air mixed in, thereby reducing costs. The soft ice cream machine fills a cone or dish from a spigot. In the United States, chains such as Dairy Queen, Carvel, and Tastee-Freez helped popularize soft-serve ice cream. Baskin-Robbins would later incorporate it into their menu.\n\nTechnological innovations such as these have introduced various food additives into ice cream, most notably the stabilizing agent gluten, to which some people have an intolerance. Recent awareness of this issue has prompted a number of manufacturers to start producing gluten-free ice cream.\n\nThe 1980s saw thicker ice creams being sold as \"premium\" and \"super-premium\" varieties under brands such as Ben & Jerry's, Chocolate Shoppe Ice Cream Company and H\u00e4agen-Dazs.\n\nComposition \nIce cream is a colloidal emulsion made with water, ice, milk fat, milk protein, sugar and air. Water and fat have the highest proportions by weight creating an emulsion that has dispersed phase as fat globules. The emulsion is turned into foam by incorporating air cells which are frozen to form dispersed ice cells. The triacylglycerols in fat are non polar and will adhere to themselves by Van der Waals interactions. Water is polar, thus emulsifiers are needed for dispersion of fat. Also ice cream has a colloidal phase of foam which helps in its light texture. Milk proteins such as casein and whey protein present in ice cream are amphiphilic, can adsorb water and form micelles which will contribute to its consistency. The proteins contribute to the emulsification, aeration and texture. Sucrose which is disaccharide is usually used as a sweetening agent. Lactose which is sugar present in milk will cause freezing point depression. Thus, on freezing some water will remain unfrozen and will not give a hard texture. Too much lactose will result in a non ideal texture because of either excessive freezing point depression or lactose crystallization.\n\nProduction \n\nBefore the development of modern refrigeration, ice cream was a luxury reserved for special occasions. Making it was quite laborious; ice was cut from lakes and ponds during the winter and stored in holes in the ground, or in wood-frame or brick ice houses, insulated by straw. Many farmers and plantation owners, including U.S. Presidents George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, cut and stored ice in the winter for use in the summer. Frederic Tudor of Boston turned ice harvesting and shipping into a big business, cutting ice in New England and shipping it around the world.\n\nIce cream was made by hand in a large bowl placed inside a tub filled with ice and salt. This is called the pot-freezer method. French confectioners refined the pot-freezer method, making ice cream in a  (a covered pail with a handle attached to the lid). In the pot-freezer method, the temperature of the ingredients is reduced by the mixture of crushed ice and salt. The salt water is cooled by the ice, and the action of the salt on the ice causes it to (partially) melt, absorbing latent heat and bringing the mixture below the freezing point of pure water. The immersed container can also make better thermal contact with the salty water and ice mixture than it could with ice alone.\n\nThe hand-cranked churn, which also uses ice and salt for cooling, replaced the pot-freezer method. The exact origin of the hand-cranked freezer is unknown, but the first U.S. patent for one was #3254 issued to Nancy Johnson on 9 September 1843. The hand-cranked churn produced smoother ice cream than the pot freezer and did it quicker. Many inventors patented improvements on Johnson's design.\n\nIn Europe and early America, ice cream was made and sold by small businesses, mostly confectioners and caterers. Jacob Fussell of Baltimore, Maryland was the first to manufacture ice cream on a large scale. Fussell bought fresh dairy products from farmers in York County, Pennsylvania, and sold them in Baltimore. An unstable demand for his dairy products often left him with a surplus of cream, which he made into ice cream. He built his first ice cream factory in Seven Valleys, Pennsylvania, in 1851. Two years later, he moved his factory to Baltimore. Later, he opened factories in several other cities and taught the business to others, who operated their own plants. Mass production reduced the cost of ice cream and added to its popularity.\n\nThe development of industrial refrigeration by German engineer Carl von Linde during the 1870s eliminated the need to cut and store natural ice, and, when the continuous-process freezer was perfected in 1926, commercial mass production of ice cream and the birth of the modern ice cream industry was underway.\n\nIn modern times, a common method for producing ice cream at home is to use an ice cream maker, an electrical device that churns the ice cream mixture while cooled inside a household freezer. Some more expensive models have an built-in freezing element. A newer method is to add liquid nitrogen to the mixture while stirring it using a spoon or spatula for a few seconds; a similar technique, advocated by Heston Blumenthal as ideal for home cooks, is to add dry ice to the mixture while stirring for a few minutes. Some ice cream recipes call for making a custard, folding in whipped cream, and immediately freezing the mixture. Another method is to use a pre-frozen solution of salt and water, which gradually melts as the ice cream freezes.\n\nBorden's Eagle Brand sweetened condensed milk circulated a recipe for making ice cream at home. It may be made in an ice cube tray with condensed milk, cream, and various simple flavourings. It can be ready to serve after as little as four hours of freezing. Fresh or frozen fruit, nuts, chocolate, and other ingredients may be added as well.\n\nAn unusual method of making ice cream was done during World War II by American fighter pilots based in the South Pacific. They attached pairs of  cans to their aircraft. The cans were fitted with a small propeller, this was spun by the slipstream and drove a stirrer, which agitated the mixture while the intense cold of high altitude froze it. B-17 crews in Europe did something similar on their bombing runs as did others.\n\nRetail sales \n\nIce cream can be mass-produced and thus is widely available in developed parts of the world. Ice cream can be purchased in large cartons (vats and squrounds) from supermarkets and grocery stores, in smaller quantities from ice cream shops, convenience stores, and milk bars, and in individual servings from small carts or vans at public events. In 2015, the US produced nearly 900 million gallons of ice cream.\n\nSpecialty job \n\nToday, jobs specialize in the selling of ice cream. The title of a person who works in this speciality is often called an 'ice cream man', however women also specialize in the selling of ice cream. People in this line of work often sell ice cream on beaches. On beaches, ice cream is either sold by a person who carries a box full of ice cream and is called over by people who want to purchase ice cream, or by a person who drives up to the top of the beach and rings a bell. In the second method, people go up to the top of the beach and purchase ice cream straight from the ice cream seller, who is often in an ice cream van. In Turkey and Australia, ice cream is sometimes sold to beach-goers from small powerboats equipped with chest freezers.\n\nSome ice cream distributors sell ice cream products from travelling refrigerated vans or carts (commonly referred to in the US as \"ice cream trucks\"), sometimes equipped with speakers playing children's music or folk melodies (such as \"Turkey in the Straw\"). The driver of an ice cream van drives throughout neighbourhoods and stops every so often, usually every block. The seller on the ice cream van sells the ice cream through a large window; this window is also where the customer asks for ice cream and pays. Ice cream vans in the United Kingdom make a music box noise rather than actual music.\n\nIngredients and standard quality definitions \n\nMany countries have regulations controlling what can be described as ice cream.\n\nIn the U.S., the FDA rules state that to be described as \"ice cream\", a product must have the following composition:\n greater than 10% milk fat\n 6 to 10% milk and non-fat milk solids: this component, also known as the milk solids-not-fat or serum solids, contains the proteins (caseins and whey proteins) and carbohydrates (lactose) found in milk\n\nIt generally also has:\n 12 to 16% sweeteners: usually a combination of sucrose and glucose-based corn syrup sweeteners\n 0.2 to 0.5% stabilizers and emulsifiers\n 55 to 64% water, which comes from the milk or other ingredients.\n\nThese compositions are percentage by weight. Since ice cream can contain as much as half air by volume, these numbers may be reduced by as much as half if cited by volume. In terms of dietary considerations, the percentages by weight are more relevant.\nEven the low-fat products have high caloric content: Ben and Jerry's No-Fat Vanilla Fudge contains  per half-cup due to its high sugar content.\n\nAccording to the Canadian Food and Drugs Act and Regulations, ice cream in Canada is divided into  Ice cream mix and Ice cream. Each have a different set of regulations.\n Ice cream must be at least 10 percent milk fat, and must contain at least 180 grams of solids per litre. When cocoa, chocolate syrup, fruit, nuts, or confections are added, the percentage of milk fat can be 8 percent.\n The ice cream mix is defined as the pasteurized mix of cream, milk and other milk products that are not yet frozen. It may contain eggs, artificial or non-artificial flavours, cocoa or chocolate syrup, a food colour, an agent that adjusts the pH level in the mix, salt, a stabilizing agent that doesn't exceed 0.5% of the ice cream mix, a sequestering agent which preserves the food colour, edible casein that doesn't exceed 1% of the mix, propylene glycol mono fatty acids in an amount that will not exceed 0.35% of the ice cream mix, and sorbitan tristearate in an amount that will not exceed 0.035% of the mix. The ice cream mix may not include less than 36% solid components.\n\nPhysical properties \n\nIce cream is considered a colloidal system. It is composed by ice cream crystals and aggregates, air that does not mix with the ice cream by forming small bubbles in the bulk and partially coalesced fat globules. This dispersed phase made from all the small particles is surrounded by an unfrozen continuous phase composed by sugars, proteins, salts, polysaccharides and water. Their interactions determine the properties of ice cream, whether soft and whippy or hard.\n\nOstwald ripening \n\nOstwald ripening is the explanation for the growth of large crystals at the expense of small ones in the dispersion phase. This process is also called migratory recrystallization. It involves the formation of sharp crystals. Theories about Ostwald recrystallization admit that after a period of time, the recrystallization process can be described by the following equation:\n\nWhere r (0) is the initial size, n the order of recrystallization, and t a time constant for recrystallization that depends on the rate R (in units of size/time).\n\nTo make ice cream smooth, recrystallization must occur as slowly as possible, because small crystals create smoothness, meaning that r must decrease.\n\nFood safety concerns \nFrom the perspective of food chemistry, ice cream is a colloid or foam. The dietary emulsifier plays an important role in ice cream. Soy lecithin and polysorbate are two popular emulsifiers used for ice cream production. A mouse study in 2015 shows that two commonly used dietary emulsifiers carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and polysorbate 80 (P80) can potentially cause inflammatory bowel diseases, weight gain, and other metabolic syndromes.\n\nAround the world \n\nAround the world, different cultures have developed unique versions of ice cream, suiting the product to local tastes and preferences.\n\nThe most traditional Argentine helado (ice cream) is very similar to Italian gelato, in large part due to the historical influence of Italian immigrants on Argentinian customs.\n\nPer capita, Australians and New Zealanders are among the leading ice cream consumers in the world, eating 18 litres and 20 litres each per year respectively, behind the United States where people eat 23 litres each per year.\n\nIn China, besides the popular flavours such as vanilla, chocolate, coffee, mango and strawberry, many Chinese ice-cream manufacturers have also introduced other traditional Chinese flavours such as black sesame and red bean.\n\nIn 1651, Italian Francesco dei Coltelli opened an ice cream caf\u00e9 in Paris, and the product became so popular that during the next 50 years another 250 caf\u00e9s opened in Paris.\n\nIn Greece, ice cream in its modern form, or pagot\u00f3 (), was introduced in the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nIndia is one of the largest producers of ice cream in the world, but most of its ice cream is consumed domestically.\n\nIn Indonesia, a type of traditional ice cream called es puter or \"stirred ice cream\" is made from coconut milk, pandanus leaves, sugar\u2014and flavors that include avocado, jackfruit, durian, palm sugar, chocolate, red bean, and mung bean.\n\nIn Iran, f\u0101l\u016bde (Persian: \u0641\u0627\u0644\u0648\u062f\u0647) or p\u0101l\u016bde (Persian: \u067e\u0627\u0644\u0648\u062f\u0647) is a Persian sorbet made of thin vermicelli noodles, frozen with sugar syrup and rose water. The dessert is often served with lime juice and sometimes ground pistachios.\n\nItalian ice cream, or gelato as it is known, is a traditional and popular dessert in Italy. Much of the production is still hand-made and flavoured by each individual shop in \"produzione propria\" gelaterias. Gelato is made from whole milk, sugar, sometimes eggs, and natural flavourings. Gelato typically contains 7\u20138% fat, less than ice cream's minimum of 10%.\n\nSorbetes is a Philippine version of common ice cream usually peddled from carts by peddlers who roam streets in the Philippines. Despite the similarities between the name sorbetes and sorbet, sorbetes is not a type of sorbet.\n\nIn Spain, ice cream is often in the style of Italian gelato. Spanish gelato can be found in many caf\u00e9s or speciality ice cream stores. While many traditional flavours are sold, caf\u00e9s may also sell flavours like nata, crema catalana, or tiramisu.\n\nDondurma is the name given to ice cream in Turkey. Dondurma typically includes milk, sugar, salep, and mastic.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, 14 million adults buy ice cream as a treat, in a market worth \u00a31.3 billion (according to a report produced in September 2009).\n\nIn the United States, ice cream made with just cream, sugar, and a flavouring (usually fruit) is sometimes referred to as \"Philadelphia style\" ice cream. Ice cream that uses eggs to make a custard is sometimes called \"French ice cream\". American federal labelling standards require ice cream to contain a minimum of 10% milk fat. Americans consume about 23 litres of ice cream per person per year\u2014the most in the world.\n\nCones \n\nMrs A.B.Marshall's Cookery Book, published in 1888, endorsed serving ice cream in cones, but the idea predated that. Agnes Marshall was a celebrated cookery writer of her day and helped to popularize ice cream. She patented and manufactured an ice cream maker and was the first person to suggest using liquefied gases to freeze ice cream after seeing a demonstration at the Royal Institution.\n\nReliable evidence proves that ice cream cones were served in the 19th century, and their popularity increased greatly during the St. Louis World's Fair in 1904. According to legend, an ice cream vendor at the fair ran out of cardboard dishes. The vendor at the Syrian waffle booth next door, unsuccessful in the intense heat, offered to make cones by rolling up his waffles. The new product sold well and was widely copied by other vendors.\n\nOther frozen desserts \n\nThe following is a partial list of ice creamy frozen desserts and snacks:\n\n Ais kacang: a dessert in Malaysia and Singapore made from shaved ice, syrup, and boiled red bean and topped with evaporated milk\n Booza: an elastic, sticky, high-level melt resistant ice cream\n Dondurma: Turkish ice cream, made of salep and mastic resin\n Frozen custard: at least 10% milk fat, at least 1.4% egg yolk and much less air beaten into it, similar to Gelato, fairly rare; known in Italy as Semifreddo\n Frozen yogurt: made with yogurt instead of milk or cream, it has a tart flavour and lower fat content\n Gelato: an Italian frozen dessert having a lower milk fat content than ice cream\n Halo-halo: a popular Filipino dessert that is a mixture of shaved ice and milk to which are added various boiled sweet beans and fruits, and served cold in a tall glass or bowl\n Ice cream sandwich: two (usually) soft biscuits, cookies or cake sandwiching a bar of ice cream\n Ice milk: less than 10% milk fat and lower sweetening content, once marketed as \"ice milk\" but now sold as low-fat ice cream in the United States\n Ice pop or ice lolly: frozen fruit puree, fruit juice, or flavoured sugar water on a stick or in a flexible plastic sleeve\n Kulfi: believed to have originated in the Indian subcontinent during Mughal India\n Maple toffee: Also known as maple taffy. A popular springtime treat in maple-growing areas is maple toffee, where maple syrup boiled to a concentrated state is poured over fresh snow congealing in a toffee-like mass, and then eaten from a wooden stick used to pick it up from the snow\n Mellorine: non-dairy, with vegetable fat substituted for milk fat\n Parevine: Kosher non-dairy frozen dessert established in 1969 in New York\n Patbingsu: A popular Korean shaved ice dessert commonly served with sweet toppings such as fruit, red bean, or sweetened condensed milk\n Sherbet: 1\u20132% milk fat and sweeter than ice cream\n Sorbet: fruit puree with no dairy products\n Snow cones: made from balls of crushed ice topped with flavoured syrup served in a paper cone\n\nCryogenics \n\nIn 2006, some commercial ice cream makers began to use liquid nitrogen in the primary freezing of ice cream, thus eliminating the need for a conventional ice cream freezer. The preparation results in a column of white condensed water vapour cloud. The ice cream, dangerous to eat while still \"steaming\" with liquid nitrogen, is allowed to rest until the liquid nitrogen is completely vaporized. Sometimes ice cream is frozen to the sides of the container, and must be allowed to thaw. Good results can also be achieved with the more readily available dry ice, and authors such as Heston Blumenthal have published recipes to produce ice cream and sorbet using a simple blender.\n\nSee also \n\n Cold-stimulus headache\n Ice cream social\n List of dairy products\n List of desserts\n List of ice cream brands\n List of ice cream flavors\n Milkshake (a blended mix of ice cream, milk and syrups)\n Nancy Maria Donaldson Johnson\n Soft serve\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\n How It's Made: UConn Dairy Bar Ice Cream\n Selected Internet Resources \u2013 Ice Cream / Science Reference Section, Library of Congress\n\n \nDairy products\nDesserts\nTypes of food\nFrozen desserts\nWorld cuisine\nIndependence Day (United States) foods", "machine_text": "Ice cream is a frozen dessert consisting of dairy products, such as cream and milk, that are combined with sugar, flavorings, and other additives to create a sweet treat loved by millions worldwide. The origins of ice cream can be traced back to ancient China, where milk and ice were combined to create a delicious treat. In the early days of ice cream, it was a luxury item that was only available to the wealthy. However, as the industrial revolution brought advances in technology and transportation, ice cream became more widely available and affordable. Today, it is a staple dessert at restaurants, ice cream shops, and in households around the globe. There are countless flavors of ice cream available, ranging from traditional favorites like vanilla and chocolate to more unique flavors like green tea, lavender, and bacon. The texture of ice cream can also vary, with options such as soft serve, hard ice cream, and creamy gelato. The process of making ice cream involves combining cream and sugar, heating the mixture to pasteurize it and kill any bacteria, and then adding flavorings and other ingredients. Once the base mixture is prepared, it is churned in an ice cream maker to incorporate air into the mixture and create a creamy texture. Finally, the ice cream is frozen to a specific temperature to ensure the perfect consistency. Ice cream is a versatile treat that can be enjoyed on its own or used as a topping for other desserts. It is also a popular ingredient in milkshakes, ice cream sandwiches, and other creative desserts. Overall, ice cream is a beloved dessert that has been enjoyed for centuries. With its endless variety of flavors and textures, it is sure to remain a popular indulgence for many years to come.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 48212}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Madonna of the Candelabra\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Madonna of the Candelabra is a Madonna painting by the Italian Renaissance artist Raphael, dating to about 1513-1514 and is in the collection of the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore. \n\nPainted during his Roman period, this tondo Madonna of the Virgin and Child employs a rare motif of flanking candelabra that was derived from representations of ancient Roman emperors. Through this reference to the rulers of antiquity, Raphael alludes to Christ's and Mary's roles as the king and queen of Heaven.   Raphael was famed for his graceful style. which combined the study of classical sculpture and nature. The chiaroscuro effects (modeling in light and shade) and gentle coloring give the figures a soft, delicate appearance. The painting relies heavily on the participation of Raphael's workshop, and the two angels certainly were done by his assistants. This was the first Madonna painted by Raphael to enter a North American collection. It was purchased by Henry Walters in 1901.\n\nThe central portion of the painting was issued as the traditional holiday first class Christmas stamp for 2011 by the United States Postal Service.

The painting depicts the Virgin Mary holding the Infant Jesus, with Saint Joseph and Saint John the Baptist beside them, while a group of angels hold a candelabrum over them. The painting is currently housed at the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, Italy. The painting is known for its use of light and shadow, and the intricate details of the fabric on the characters' clothing. It is also noted for its expression of emotions. The Virgin Mary's expression is serene, while Saint Joseph looks concerned, and Saint John the Baptist has a look of awe. Madonna of the Candelabra was created during the High Renaissance period, a time of great artistic achievement in Italy. Raphael was known for his compositions and his ability to capture the beauty of nature. He was also known for his use of color and his attention to detail. The painting was commissioned by Taddeo Taddei, a wealthy Florentine merchant and art collector. Taddei was a patron of the arts, and he commissioned several works from Raphael. Madonna of the Candelabra was one of the last works that Raphael created for Taddei before his death.

She was born on April 20, 1586, and died on August 24, 1617, at the age of 31. Saint Rose was the first person born in the Americas to be canonized by the Roman Catholic Church, and she is the patron saint of the Americas, as well as of Peru, florists, and gardeners. Early Life Saint Rose was the daughter of Gaspar Flores, a Spanish colonist, and Maria de Oliva, an Indian woman. She was baptized as Isabel, but later took the name Rose when she became a nun. Saint Rose was known for her beauty, and many men pursued her, but she refused them all, as she had taken a vow of chastity at a young age. Her family was against her decision to become a nun, but she eventually won them over. Life as a Nun Saint Rose joined the Third Order of Saint Dominic, and she lived a life of self-denial, prayer, and penance. She slept on a bed of broken glass, ate only bread and water, and frequently visited hospitals to care for the sick and the poor. Saint Rose had a great devotion to the infant Jesus, and she would often meditate on his life and teachings. Miracles Saint Rose is said to have had many supernatural experiences. She had a vision of Saint Catherine of Siena, who gave her advice on how to live a holy life. Saint Rose also had the gift of bilocation, meaning that she could be in two places at once. In one instance, she was seen in both Lima and in Mexico at the same time. Saint Rose is also said to have performed many miracles, including healing the sick and raising the dead. Canonization Saint Rose was canonized by Pope Clement X on April 12, 1671, and she was the first saint born in the Americas to be canonized by the Roman Catholic Church. Saint Rose's feast day is celebrated on August 23, the day before her death. The shrine of Saint Rose in Lima is a popular destination for pilgrims, and her image can be found in many churches throughout the Americas. Legacy Saint Rose is remembered for her devotion to God and her love for the poor and the sick. She is an example of how faith and love can overcome adversity and inspire others to live a holy life. Saint Rose's legacy continues to inspire people to this day, and her name is synonymous with courage, selflessness, and devotion.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 3837454}

He often depicted factories, bridges, and other industrial structures, capturing the beauty and power of modern technology. His paintings are characterized by their strong compositions, attention to detail, and use of bold colors. In the 1930s, during the Great Depression, Sloan worked as a muralist for the Works Progress Administration (WPA), a federal program that employed artists and writers.

A few major airlines may also use them.\n\nA crew working a CDO will generally operate the last flight out at night, have on duty time on the ground (anywhere from 0\u20138 hours) at the destination and then operate the first flight back in the morning. Since the break between flights is not sufficient to qualify as a free from duty rest period, the crewmembers remain continuously on duty, even though they may have been provided with a hotel room for rest. Crew members would normally require a specific amount of resting hours in between shifts based on their countries and airlines but by using the term continuous duty, they are able to go beyond the specified rest period due to being on duty.\nAnother factor is delays. Because of this set up; delays taken throughout the day that result in a delay the last flight (first flight of a CDO) do not impact the first flight the next day. It would simply reduce the amount of time the crew are on the ground.\n\nThe continuous duty overnight schedule could be flown 3\u20135 times consecutively (i.e., back-to-back).\n\nExamples\nFlight crew report to the airport at 2040 (8:40\u00a0pm), which means the crew will have to arrive earlier to park, clear airport security, and get to their operations office to check in.

In that time they have to ride to and check in (about 20 minutes) at the hotel. They would get to their hotel room about 0100 and have to be awake at 0530 (30 minutes to get ready) for the 0600 shuttle to the airport, leaving the crew about 4 hours and 30 minutes of \u201crest\u201d. A 0650 departure and 2-hour, 18-minute return trip gets them to the gate at 0908. After unloading they would be released (still at the aircraft) at 0923. That is a total of 12 hours and 43 minutes on duty, and 5 hours and 8 minutes of flying.\nFlight crew report at 2100, fly from 2200 to 2300, \"stand-up\" on duty overnight from 2315 to 0515, then fly 0600 to 0700, followed by a rest period from 0700 to 1700. The flight crew would then report at 1700, fly 1800 to 1900, \"stand-up\" on duty 1915 to 0115, and then fly 0200 to 0300. This example involves only one-hour flights, which are less than the times and number of segments that might typically be flown.\n\nOther issues\nSome crews are not provided a hotel by their airline or want to make the most of their time on the ground and resort to sleeping on board in the crew rest compartment or other rest facility. Pilots take off their ties and hang up their shirts. \"You don't want to look unprofessional after sleeping in an aircraft,\" another pilot said. \"There are some people that bring sleeping bags and pillows and their own blankets so they don't have to use the airline blankets.\" In airline slang, this is called 'a camp out.'\n\nIncidents & Accidents from CDOs\nRunway incursion at Cleveland Hopkins International\n\nRunway incursion at Baltimore-Washington International Airport\n\nBroke 10,000 speed restriction near DTW\n\nTakeoff from the wrong runway at La Crosse\n\nCrew taxied to the incorrect runway at Jacksonville\n\nLow altitude on an ILS approach at Akron-Canton\n\nTakeoff without clearance at Cincinnati\n\nTakeoff in the wrong aircraft at La Crosse\n\nTakeoff without required fuel at Atlanta\n\nLined up to land on the wrong runway at Chicago O'Hare\n\nRunway incursion at Dallas Fort Worth\n\nTakeoff in the wrong aircraft in Denver\n\nRunway incursion at Kalamazoo\n\nReferences\n\nAviation safety", "machine_text": "Continuous duty overnight is a work shift that requires individuals to work throughout the night, typically lasting from 8 to 12 hours. This type of shift is commonly found in industries that require 24-hour monitoring and operations, such as healthcare, transportation, and security. People who work continuously overnight are often called night-shift workers or overnight workers. While the majority of workers in the world work during the day, more and more companies are realizing the need to have night-shift workers. This is because ensuring that critical operations like patient care, aviation, public safety, maintenance, and manufacturing continue uninterrupted is paramount to the economic performance and public safety of a nation. Working continuously overnight can have an impact on a person\u2019s health, however, frequent interruptions of sleep patterns and social life can lead to adverse effects on employees\u2019 wellbeing, including increased fatigue, stress, and insomnia. These symptoms can lead to physical health issues, emotional issues, and a decrease in job satisfaction and productivity. Additionally, it can be difficult for night-shift workers to balance their work life with their personal life, resulting in social isolation. Employers can address these issues by providing effective training, monitoring, and management of night-shift workers' health and safety. Effective communication, comfortable workspaces, and good lighting are also critical. Additionally, incentives such as higher pay and flexible working hours can help to improve the job satisfaction of night workers. In conclusion, continuous duty overnight is vital in many industries but can be detrimental to workers' health if not handled correctly. Employers must ensure that night workers receive ample support to sustain and achieve a high standard of living personally and professionally. This will not only improve the wellbeing of the workers but also increase productivity in their respective industries.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 18363669}

It is now home to a restaurant called the Dinner Bell Cafe. The depot is a fine example of the Richardsonian Romanesque style of architecture, which was a popular style in the early 20th century. The depot is a two-story building and has a rectangular floor plan. The exterior of the building is made of red brick and limestone, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The building features Romanesque arches, ornate carvings, and a steeply pitched roof. The depot originally had a large platform that was used by passengers to board and disembark from the train. The platform was removed in the 1970s. The Louisville and Nashville Railroad played a vital role in the economic development of Conecuh County in the early 20th century. The railroad played a key role in transporting timber and other natural resources from the county to other parts of the state and the country. The railroad also brought in goods and services to the county, which helped to develop the local economy. The Louisville and Nashville Depot (Evergreen, Alabama) was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.

Some praised Tsai's daring approach to filmmaking, while others criticized the explicit sexual content. However, the film ultimately gained a cult following for its unique style and humor.

The museum also serves as the National Headquarters for the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War (SUVCW), the legal successor to the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR). In 2009, the museum became affiliated with the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.\n\nHistory\nFormer Harrisburg Mayor Steve Reed, a Civil War enthusiast, was behind the museum's development, which cost 32 million dollars. The museum opened to the public in 2001. It is now privately owned, and has an association with the Smithsonian Institution. Recently, the Museum published a book about the Union General Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, one of many planned books the museum hopes to publish.\n\nLocation\nThe museum is located in a two-story brick building in Harrisburg's Reservoir Park in the Allison Hill neighborhood. The exhibits and self-guided tour begin on the second floor of the museum (first ten galleries) and continue on the first floor (last seven galleries and theater). A gift shop, temporary exhibit gallery, and museum support are on the first floor. A \"Walk of Valor,\" consisting of red bricks bearing the names of Civil War veterans who have been honored by their surviving descendants, contributes to the museum's memorial-like grounds. It also shows pictures of the current president that was congratulating some of the honored veterans at a ceremony.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Conomurex luhuanus\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Conomurex luhuanus, common name Strawberry conch or Tiger conch, is a species of medium-sized sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Strombidae, the true conchs. C. luhuanus is found in sandy habitat among corals in the Indopacific region.  They feed on algae or detritus, move with a modified foot, and have complex eyes compared to other gastropods.\n\nShell description \n\nThe shell of C. luhuanus ranges from a more common length of 5\u00a0cm, to a maximum length of 8\u00a0cm.\n\nC. luhuanus is often mistaken for a cone snail, mainly because of the conoidal outline of its shell, which is relatively unusual among the Strombidae. Its stromboid notch, though not as conspicuous as observed in many species that used to belong to  Strombus (such as Lentigo lentiginosus), is deep and easily distinguished. The interior may be slightly lirate.\n\nThe external color of the shell can be either white with an orange, brown/tan pattern of blotches, or completely brown/white. The interior is usually colored strong orange, red or pink, and the inner lip border is black or chocolate brown.\n\nPhylogeny\n\nThe phylogenetic relationships among the Strombidae have been mainly accessed on two occasions, by Simone (2005) and Latiolais (2006), using two distinct methods. Simone proposed a cladogram (a tree of descent) based on an extensive morpho-anatomical analysis of representatives of Aporrhaidae, Strombidae, Xenophoridae and Struthiolariidae, which included C. luhuanus.\n\nWith the exception of Lambis and Terebellum, the remaining taxa were previously allocated within the genus Strombus, including C. luhuanus. However, according to Simone, only Strombus gracilior, Strombus alatus and Strombus pugilis, the type species, remained within Strombus, as they constituted a distinct group based on at least five synapomorphies (traits that are shared by two or more taxa and theirmost recent common ancestor). The remaining taxa were previously considered as subgenera, and were elevated to genus level by Simone in the end of his analysis. The genus Conomurex, in this case, only included C. luhuanus.\n\nIn a different approach, Latiolais et al. (2006) proposed a cladogram based on sequences of nuclear histone H3 gene and mitochondrial cytochrome-c oxidase I (COI) gene showing phylogenetic relationships of 32 species that used to belong to the genus Strombus and Lambis, including Conomurex luhuanus (= Strombus luhuanus). All species in this cladogram are still given under their original names in Strombus and Lambis.\n\n Habitat and ecology \nC. luhuanus dwells in sandy substrate in tropical habitats, such as the Great Barrier Reef and southern Papua New Guinea. They often form colonies that move together over long periods of time. Two types of colonies have been described: colonies of juveniles that are made up of conch of the same size-class, and colonies of mixed age-classes that contain individual conch of a spectrum of ages, although within the colony separation based on age still persists. C. luhuanus are herbivores or feed on detritus. They use their proboscis to pick up sand which they may then swallow or eat algae from. Strombus also have sensory tentacles at the end of their eyestalks which may play a role in chemically sensing the presence of nearby food. The sensory tentacles may also be important in detecting predators, such as carnivorous snails. Unlike many snails that move by slowly creeping along their terrain, members of the Strombus family move with an awkward leaping motion as they thrust off the sea floor with their modified foot. This leaping motion is also used to quickly escape from predators.\n\n Reproduction \nC. luhuanus form mating aggregations of copulating individuals were males and females compete for reproduction opportunities.\n\n Vision \nThe eyes of members of the Strombus family are positioned at the ends of eye stalks and typically have a diameter of about 1.5-2.5\u00a0mm, which is large compared to their body size. The eye stalks extend from two notches in the shell. The eye of Strombus contains a spherical lens, a cornea, a pupil with a pigmented iris surrounding it, a vitreous body, and a cup-shaped retina. In contrast, some other gastropods only possess small open eyes containing a gelatinous substance. The retina is made up of several layers. The first layer, located adjacent to the vitreous body, is primarily composed of the processes of photoreceptor cells. This layer is approximately 180\u00a0um thick. The next layer is characterized by an abundance of dark pigment granules. The following layer contains the cell bodies of different cell types, and the last layer consists of neuropil. It is from the neuropil layer that the optic nerve projects in several small branches that eventually merge to form a single nerve fiber. Strombus has almost 100,000 photoreceptors, whereas some nudibranchs merely have five. Three distinct cell types have been described in the retinas of C. luhuanus, one of which is a photoreceptor, another which is a glial cell, and the last which may be a second type of photoreceptor. \u00a0Only one type of visual pigment has been identified in C. luhuanus, suggesting that they do not possess color vision.\n\nElectrophysiological recordings that measure electrical impulses, or action potentials, from neurons have been used to study the neural processing of visual information from the eye of C. luhuanus. When eyes adapted to the dark were shown brief flashes of light, a cornea-negative potential was evoked. This response was termed the \"on\" response. When light was presented to the dark-adapted eye for a longer period of time, the extracellular retinal potential (ERG) recordings showed the cornea-negative potential declined until a steady-state was reached. Then, the steady-state was maintained until the light stimulus ceased and the potential returned to baseline. Finally, a third type of response that fired at the cessation of light stimulus was observed and termed the \"off\" response. These different waveform responses could indicate that C. luhuanus is capable of complex neural processing involving excitation, inhibition, and synaptic inhibition. The \"on\" response could be due to excitation of the optic nerve in response to depolarizing photoreceptors, while the decline to steady-state potential could be a sign of synaptic inhibition, and the \"off\" activity could indicate release from light-promoted inhibition.\n\nThe light-promoted \"off\" potentials were found to be sensitive to anesthesia by magnesium chloride, with repetitive \"off\" potentials eliminated within minutes of being introduced to the magnesium chloride solution. However, the light-promoted \"on\" potentials were not affected by the magnesium chloride and would continue firing over an hour after being immersed in the magnesium chloride solution. These results could indicate that nerve fibers that are responsible for \"off\" stimuli are regulated by chemical synapses, which can be inhibited by magnesium.\n\nIt is not entirely clear why C. luhuanus evolved such well-developed eyes. Usually eyes of this complexity are found on predators that move quickly through their environment looking for prey, not in slow-moving herbivorous creatures such as C. luhuanus. One study suggests that the eyes are important for coordination in the escape response of Strombus. When conch were blinded, they showed an increased probability of leaping nearer to the predator instead of away from it. More work remains to be done on the purpose of the eyes, however.\n\n Regeneration \nAnother remarkable feature of the eyes of Strombus luhuanus is that they are capable of regeneration following amputation. The first step of regeneration following severance of the optic nerve is the formation of an eye cup as the epithelium adjacent to the cut folds inward. This occurs within a day after the optic nerve is cut. The eye cup is closed by day three, and at this stage it resembles an embryonic eye. The diameter of the eye continues to increase, and meanwhile the cells of the eye differentiate to form the different layers in the retina. When the diameter of the eye reaches about 0.8\u00a0mm (after about 15 days), the retina looks like a mature adult eye. The eye will continue to grow until it becomes fully sized, with a diameter of 2\u00a0mm, which can take several months. Size, age, sex, nutritional state, or whether the left or right eye is amputated does not have a substantial influence on the regenerative prospects of the eye.\n\nIn gastropod eye regeneration, the degenerating nerve is important for the formation of the new eye. New axons leave the eye cup and bundle together to form the optic nerve. The new nerve fibers seem to be attracted to the previous optic nerve, and grow down it until they make contact with the cerebral ganglion.\n\nElectroretinograms (ERGs) have been used to monitor neuron activity in the developing eye of C. luhuanus over the course of the eye's development. The ERGs of the regenerating C. luhuanus eye grow increasingly complex as the eye matures. During the first week of regeneration, a simple \"on\" peak was recorded, and steady-state potentials were observed in response to prolonged illumination. When the eye reached about 0.4\u00a0mm in diameter, an \"off\" response was observed occasionally. At a diameter of 0.6\u00a0mm, rhythmic ERG \"off\" responses were detected. By 0.8\u00a0mm in diameter, the ERGs of the regenerated eye resembled that of a mature adult eye, with two distinct cornea-negative \"on\" potentials and rhythmic \"off\" potentials.\n\nReferences \n\n Walls, J.G.

The Conomurex luhuanus has an elongated shell that measures 7-10 cm in length and 3-4 cm in width. Its shell is sturdy and cone-shaped with a pointed end, and the color varies from pale to white. The ridges running along the surface of the shell are noticeable, and it has spines on the shoulder of the last whorl. This species lives in shallow marine environments ranging from intertidal to subtidal zones. They usually dwell on rocky reefs and sandy bottoms. They also inhabit seagrass beds and coral reefs, where they feed on other mollusks, crustaceans, and small fish. The Conomurex luhuanus plays a crucial role in the ecosystem as a predator and prey to other organisms. It is also considered a delicacy in the Philippines, where it is commonly consumed and sold fresh or pickled in vinegar and spices. Unfortunately, the Conomurex luhuanus population has reduced in numbers due to overfishing and depletion of their natural habitats. In response, the Philippine government has implemented laws and regulations to protect this species and its environment.

It resulted in the defeat of the minority Progressive Conservative (Tory) government of Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, with the Liberals returning to power for the first time in 6 years, where they would remain for twenty of the next twenty-one years (winning every election except the 1979 election until their landslide defeat in 1984).  For the Social Credit Party, despite getting their highest ever share of the vote, the party lost 6 seats compared to its high-water mark in 1962.\n\nOverview\nDuring the Tories' last year in office, members of the Diefenbaker Cabinet attempted to remove him from the leadership of the party, and therefore from the Prime Minister's office. In addition to concern within the party about Diefenbaker's mercurial style of leadership, there had been a serious split in party ranks over the issue of stationing American nuclear missiles (see Bomarc missile) on Canadian soil for protection from possible Soviet attack. Diefenbaker and his allies opposed this proposal, while many other Conservatives and the opposition Liberal Party were in favour. Minister of National Defence Douglas Harkness resigned from Cabinet on February 4, 1963, because of Diefenbaker's opposition to accepting the missiles.\n\nWhen it turned out that nearly half of his cabinet was also prepared to resign over the issue, Diefenbaker announced that he himself would resign with immediate effect and recommend that the Governor General appoint Minister of Justice Donald Fleming as acting Prime Minister pending a new Progressive Conservative leadership convention. Diefenbaker's allies persuaded him not to go through with the resignation, however, as there were two non-confidence motions over the issue scheduled for the following day, which the government could not feasibly hope to survive with only an acting Prime Minister leading them. However, the furore caused by the cabinet split and Diefenbaker's near-resignation left the Tories without enough time to feasibly negotiate a deal with the Social Credit Party, whose support they had been relying on to remain in power since the previous election, and resulted in Diefenbaker's government losing both non-confidence motions and consequently falling.\n\nThe Liberal Party of Lester Pearson ran on a platform promising that, if elected, they would begin their term with \"60 Days of Decision\" on questions such as introducing a new Canadian flag, reforming health care, and a public pension plan, along with other legislative reforms.\n\nDespite winning 41% of the vote, which is usually sufficient for ensuring the election of a majority government, the Liberals fell five seats short of their target. The Liberals formed a minority government that was dependent on the support of the social democratic New Democratic Party (NDP) in order to pass legislation.\n\nThe social-democratic NDP had been formed in 1961 by a socialist party, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, and by the Canadian Labour Congress. The 1963 election was the second vote contested by the NDP. The party won slightly fewer votes, and two fewer seats, than they had received in the 1962 election. They were again disappointed by the failure of their new partnership with the labour movement to produce an electoral breakthrough, particularly in the province of Ontario, which has the largest population and the largest number of seats in the House of Commons.\n\nThe Social Credit Party was unable to increase its representation in western Canada, and lost four of its Quebec seats - this despite gaining a slightly better share of the vote compared to 1962.  Indeed, 1963 represented the highest share the party would ever get. The continuing lop-sided result led to a split in the party when Thompson refused to step aside so that R\u00e9al Caouette could become party leader. Caouette and his followers left the Social Credit Party to sit as a separate social credit caucus, the Ralliement des cr\u00e9ditistes.\n\nNational results \n\nNotes:\n\n* The party did not nominate candidates in the previous election.\n\nx - less than 0.005% of the popular vote\n\nVote and seat summaries\n\nResults by province\n\nxx - less than 0.05% of the popular vote\n\nSee also\n \nList of Canadian federal general elections\nList of political parties in Canada\n26th Canadian Parliament\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\nA Sordid Affair, by Norman Hillmer\n\n \n1963 elections in Canada\n1963\nApril 1963 events in Canada", "machine_text": "The 1963 Canadian federal election was held on April 8th of that year. The election was hotly contested, with four major parties vying for control of the government. The Liberal Party of Canada, led by Prime Minister Lester B.

The Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, led by John Diefenbaker, was hoping for a return to power after being defeated in the 1962 election. However, Diefenbaker's campaign was hampered by internal divisions within his party and a lack of unity among its members. The New Democratic Party of Canada, led by Tommy Douglas, ran a strong campaign on a platform of social and economic justice. The party increased its vote share and won more seats in the House of Commons than it had in the 1962 election. The Social Credit Party of Canada, led by Robert N. Thompson, also ran in the election, but it failed to gain any seats in the House of Commons. The 1963 election marked the first time that the newly created province of Nunavut was able to participate in a federal election. The territory had a single seat in the House of Commons, which was won by Liberal candidate, Tagak Curley. The election resulted in a minority government for the Liberals, as they were only able to win 129 out of the 265 seats in the House of Commons. Despite this, Pearson was able to lead a relatively stable government, as he was able to rely on the support of the NDP to pass legislation.

It appears to be an early temple from soon after 900 AD, and the presence of other temples indicates that it was an important site at that time. The surviving central shrine holds an image of dancing Shiva; all the Yogini images are, uniquely, similarly shown dancing.\n\nTemple\n\nThe Chausath Yogini Temple, built in the 9th or 10th century in Ranipur-Jharial, in an isolated position some miles from the towns of Titilagarh and Kantabanjhi in Balangir district, Odisha, is a circular, hypaethral, 64-yogini temple made of sandstone, some 50 feet in diameter. 62 of the yogini images survive. The site, on an outcrop of rock, must have been important, given the presence of a large temple built of brick and several small temples of stone. The primary entrance is an opening in the circular wall towards the east; unlike at the Hirapur yogini temple, there was once a further opening towards the south, now filled in.\n\nRanipur-Jharial was the first of the Yogini temples to be discovered; it was described by Major-General John Campbell in 1853.\n\nShrine to Shiva and Chamunda\n\nAt the centre of the temple is the original shrine with four pillars, holding an image of Nateshwar, Shiva as Lord of Dance. The Shiva images is three-faced and eight-armed, and is depicted with urdhva linga, an erection. Elephant-headed Ganesh and the bull Nandi are shown in the image's base. The similar-sized image of the goddess Chamunda in the temple may once have been housed with Shiva in the central shrine.\n\nYogini images\n\nThe Ranipur Jharial Yoginis are made, like the temple walls, of a low-quality coarse sandstone, which has weathered poorly; they were once finely-carved. Uniquely, all the Yogini images are depicted poised about to dance, in the karana pose of Indian classical dance; Vidya Dehejia explains that the posture is taken up at the start of each group of movements. Like the Hirapur temple, but unlike other Yogini temples, there are no Matrikas, mother goddesses, among the Yoginis. 14 of the Yoginis are animal-headed; among them can be seen goddesses with the heads of a cat, an elephant, a snake, a horse, a buffalo, an antelope, and seemingly also of a leopard and a sow. The leopard-headed goddess is holding up a human corpse, suggestive of the corpse rituals (shava sadhana) of the Yogini cult. The absence of haloes or attendant figures as at later Yogini temples suggests that this temple was built relatively early.\n\nThe 19th century archaeologist Alexander Cunningham described two further Yogini images. One, uniquely, had the attributes of the Sun-god, Surya; she had two arms, a lotus flower in each hand, and seven horses. The other (now surviving only from the knees down) was dancing on a reclining male; she had 6 or 8 arms, and was depicted pulling her mouth open wide; she held a skull-cup, a kettle-drum, and a sword.\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\n \n  \n\nHindu temples in Odisha\nBalangir district\n9th-century_Hindu_temples\nArchaeological monuments in Odisha\nShakti temples", "machine_text": "Chausath Yogini Temple, Ranipur Jharial is an ancient temple located in the Balangir district of Odisha, India.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Goyescas (opera)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Goyescas is an opera in one act and three tableaux, written in 1915 by the Spanish composer Enrique Granados. Granados composed the opera to a Spanish libretto by Fernando Periquet y Zuaznabar with melodies taken from his 1911 piano suite, which was also called Goyescas. The opera was first performed at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City on January 28, 1916.\n\nPerformance history\nPrevented by World War I from being presented at the Paris Op\u00e9ra, the premiere of Goyescas took place on January 28, 1916 at the Metropolitan Opera. It was the first opera to be performed there in Spanish.  Paired on a double bill with Leoncavallo's Pagliacci, the opera's cast included the leading artists Giovanni Martinelli and Giuseppe De Luca. The stage production was directed by Jules Speck. It featured sets by the Milanese designer Antonio Rovescalli, and costumes by G. B. Santoni that followed the paintings of Goya.\n\nThe opera was well received. In his review for the New York Times, Richard Aldrich wrote that the music was \"profoundly felt\" and possessed \"an intensely national color\". In spite of this success, the short opera has never found a permanent place in the opera repertoire. It has not yet been repeated at the Met following its original five performances. More recently, Goyescas was presented in a well-received production at Central City Opera (Colorado) in 2003.\n\nThe Intermezzo from the opera became a popular independent concert piece. It is performed in arrangements for orchestra, and for cello and piano.\n\nA Spanish film of Goyescas, adapted from the opera, was made in 1942. It was directed by Benito Perojo and starred Imperio Argentina.\n\nBackground\nGranados was inspired to write his popular piano suite by the paintings of Francisco Goya. After the enthusiastic response to the piano work, he was encouraged to compose the opera by Ernest Schelling, an American pianist who premiered the suite in the U.S.\n\nRegarding Goyescas, the composer wrote, \"I am enamored with the psychology of Goya, with his palette, with him, with his muse the Duchess of Alba, with his quarrels with his models, his loves and flatteries. That whitish pink of the cheeks, contrasting with the blend of black velvet; those subterranean creatures, hands of mother-of-pearl and jasmine resting on jet trinkets, have possessed me.\"\n\nThe opera was based on themes from the famous piano suite of 1911, which he orchestrated and augmented to form a three-scene work.  The libretto had to be fitted to existing melodies, the reverse of the usual way of writing an opera. Though the opera is rarely performed, the piano suite forms part of the standard Romantic piano repertoire.\n\nThe success of the Met premiere of Goyescas led indirectly to Granados's death. He was invited by President Woodrow Wilson to perform a piano recital at the White House, causing him to postpone his return to Spain. Granados and his wife lost their lives on March 24, 1916 when their ship, the French steamer Sussex, was torpedoed by a German U-boat in the English Channel.\n\nRoles\n\nSynopsis\n\nThe story of Goyescas is based on a series of six paintings from Francisco Goya\u2019s early career, inspired by the stereotypical young men and women of the majismo movement.  These majos and majas are known for their bohemian attitude and soft spot for finery. The opening scene is directly based on his 1791 painting \u2018El Pelele\u2019, painted for Charles IV of Spain to hang in his textile mill, although the painting implies a satire of the monarch\u2019s popularity.\n\nFirst Tableau\nThe majos and majas are enjoying an afternoon outside the Church of San Antonio de la Florida.  As the Manzanares River meanders in the distance, the fun loving troupe spend their time dancing, feasting, and playing a traditional game known as the pelele.  This game involves a human replication made of straw being thrown up in the air by a group using a stretched out sheet.  As they flirt and chatter, Paquiro enters, surrounded by women.  He calls all the ladies unique garden flowers, and they swoon for him, but all of them know who he supposedly belongs to. Pepa enters the scene riding her dog cart, and the men crowd around her excitedly, as she thanks them for making her feel welcome.\nSuddenly, the attention is on two richly dressed lackeys bearing a sedan-chair, and in which the high born lady Rosario waits for her lover.  Paquiro wastes no time approaching this mystery woman.  He recalls a time when she appeared at one of their lantern-lit balls, and invites her again that very night.  Rosario ignores him, but her indifference goes unnoticed by Fernando, captain of the royal guard, who was hiding away and spying on her and Paquiro.  Fernando assumes that she was flirting, and although she flatly denies it, he does not trust her.  They continue arguing while Pepa and the ladies mock them.  Fernando decides that Rosario will accept the invitation, but that he will accompany her. They leave promptly, and after sharing their plans to ruin the lovers, Pepa and Paquiro leave on their dog cart.\n\nSecond Tableau\nAt the ball that night, all the majas are dancing, while the majos watch eagerly.  Fernando enters dragging Rosario, whom Pepa proceeds to make fun of the minute she walks through the door.  Fernando assures Rosario that he will defend her honor.  Upon this, Paquiro makes a spectacle of asking Rosario to dance, and Pepa questions his motives jealously.  Fernando insults Paquiro's honor, while Rosario protests. Paquiro suggests a duel to prove his valor. A brawl begins, the women holding back Paquiro and the men from rushing Fernando, and Rosario faints in the excitement.  After setting the time and place of the duel, Fernando leaves with Rosario.  Pepa, returning to the center of attention, engages the crowd in a fandango.\n\nThird Tableau\nLater that night, Rosario sits on a bench in the palace garden, listening to the sad song of a nightingale under the light of the moon.  As she moves to go inside, Fernando approaches the house, calling to her.  She responds sorrowfully, but always lovingly, and he doubts her claims of total devotion. They share a loving moment, ruined by the presence of Paquiro, who is dressed in a black cloak with Pepa trailing furtively.  Fernando makes ready to leave, and Rosario clings to him, begging him to stay.  Fernando tears himself away, promising to return victorious, and leaves.  Rosario follows, and the duel begins.\nTwo screams signal the end of the duel, one by Fernando being mortally wounded, the other by Rosario.  Paquiro flees, dragging his cloak behind him.  Rosario drags the mortally wounded Fernando to the bench where they had just shared their tender moment.  She holds him against her bosom, and they share one last kiss before he dies in her arms.\n\nNotable references in other pieces of art\nMexican songwriter Consuelo Vel\u00e1zquez based her 1940 song B\u00e9same Mucho on the melody of the Aria of the Nightingale from the third tableau.\n\nRecordings\n Consuelo Rubio (Rosario), Gines Torrano (Fernando), Ana-Maria Iriarte (Pepa), Manuel Ausensi (Paquiro); Madrid Cantores, Spanish National Orchestra, Ata\u00falfo Argenta (conductor); Decca Records LXT 5308 (1 LP) 1955\n Mar\u00eda Bayo (Rosario), Ram\u00f3n Vargas (Fernando), Lola Casariego (Pepa), Enrique Baquerizo (Paquiro); Orfe\u00f3n Donostiarra, Orquesta Sinf\u00f3nica de Madrid, Antoni Ros-Marb\u00e0 (conductor); Auvidis V4791 (1 CD) 1996\n Rafaella Angeletti (Rosario), Yikun Chung (Fernando), Francesca Franci (Pepa), Davide Damiani (Paquiro); Coro ed Orchestra del Teatro Lirico di Cagliari, Rafael Fr\u00fchbeck de Burgos (conductor); Dynamic CDS380 (CD) 2001 live\n Maria Toledo, Nancy Fabiola Herrera, Gustavo Pena, Lidia Vinyes Curtis, BBC Singers, BBC Symphony Orchestra, Josep Pons harmonia mundi, DDD/LA, 2018\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nLink to Synopsis of Goyescas at Music with Ease.com\n\nOperas\nOne-act operas\nSpanish-language operas\nOpera world premieres at the Metropolitan Opera\n1916 operas\n1910s in Spanish music\nOperas set in Spain\nOperas by Enrique Granados\nMusic based on art\nFrancisco Goya", "machine_text": "Goyescas is an opera in one act composed by Enrique Granados. The opera premiered in New York City on January 28, 1916, at the Metropolitan Opera, and it was later performed in Madrid on March 1, 1916. Influenced by the paintings of Francisco Goya, Goyescas is considered to be an example of Spanish Nationalism in music. Granados explores the themes of love, jealousy, and dueling in the plot, which takes place in a Spanish village. The opera features beautiful melodies, intricate harmonies, and virtuosic piano accompaniments. The opening prelude, \"Los Requiebros,\" is a particularly well-known piece that showcases the composer's skillful combination of Spanish and romantic musical styles. The opera's libretto is written in Castilian Spanish by Fernando Periquet. The main characters of the opera are named Rosario and Fernando, who are lovers and are unaware of the other's romantic feelings. Rosario is married to Paquiro, a torero who is jealous of Fernando. The opera climaxes in a scene where Paquiro challenges Fernando to a duel. Goyescas has been produced by opera companies around the world, and it has been recorded by many opera singers and pianists. A ballet adaptation of the opera was also created by Russian choreographer Mikhail Fokine in 1920, which featured music from the opera and additional music by Granados. Sadly, the history of this opera is blemished by a tragic event. The composer and his wife died at sea when their ship, the Sussex, was torpedoed by a German U-boat during World War I. Granados had premiered another of his works, the \"Hymn of the Cross\" which he had composed in honour of the victims of the war, three days before his death. Today, Goyescas remains a beloved piece of Spanish music, and Granados is regarded as one of Spain's most important composers.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 19645895}

He was born in Pisa in 1473 and began his career as an assistant to his father, the famous Florentine Benozzo Gozzoli. In 1492 he signed the Tabernacle of the Visitation (Castelfiorentino, Museo Benozzo Gozzoli) together with his father, who headed the project, and brother, Francesco. Because of their similar styles, the individual contributions of each painter are not easy to distinguish, but the art historian Anna Padoa Rizzo has proposed that the more refined and elegant figures are by Alesso, whom documents suggest was Gozzoli's most esteemed son, and that the coarser passages are by Francesco, apparently of lesser renown. Padoa Rizzo in turn identified Alesso as the anonymous artist previously known by two names: the \"Maestro Esiguo,\" invented by Roberto Longhi in reference to the painter's skinny and exiguous figures, and the \"Alunno di Benozzo,\" literally the \"student of Benozzo,\" a nickname invented by Bernard Berenson.  His works were also once wrongly assigned to Amedeo Laini, called Amedeo da Pistoia.\n\nThough a relatively minor painter, Alesso was an active member of Florence's painters' confraternity, the Compagnia di San Luca. From 1495 until 1497, he and his brothers undertook to finish the frescoed Maest\u00e0 in the Palazzo Comunale, Pistoia, which their father left incomplete on his death in 1497. In addition to frescoes, Alesso painted many small-scale devotional pictures, often of the Virgin and Child or scenes from the Passion of Christ or the life of the Virgin. Examples include the Annunciation in New York (Metropolitan Museum of Art), the Crucifixion in Boston (Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum), the Deposition of Christ in Tulsa (Philbrook Museum of Art), and two similar panels of the Man of Sorrows in Princeton (Princeton University Art Museum) and Geneva (Mus\u00e9e d'Art et d'Histoire). He also painted altarpieces, like the Visitation in Castelfiorentino (Museo di Santa Verdiana) and Madonna and Child with Four Saints in Florence (Museo del Bigallo). A smaller scale altarpiece by Alesso is now at the Zimmerli Art Museum at Rutgers University.\n\nA significant number of drawings by Alesso have been identified, most by Berenson.\n\nReferences\n\n15th-century Italian painters\nItalian male painters\n16th-century Italian painters\n1473 births\n1528 deaths\nPainters from Tuscany\nItalian Renaissance painters", "machine_text": "Alesso di Benozzo was a Renaissance painter who was born in Ferrara, Italy in 1425 and died in 1492. He was a student of the well-known painter, Cosimo Tura, and became familiar with the techniques and style that had already been established by the early artists of the Italian Renaissance. Benozzo had a great talent in the art of fresco painting, and he chose to practice this form of art throughout his career. One of his notable works is the fresco cycle in the chapel at San Giovanni Battista, in the city of Modena, which was completed in 1465. These frescoes display his talents in composition and his ability to capture both beauty and emotion in his paintings. Benozzo also painted several other frescoes, including one in the Church of the Misericordia in San Gimignano, which depicts the Virgin Mary and several saints. His frescoes in the Church of San Francesco in Pisa, and in the Chapel of Santa Fina in San Gimignano are also remarkable for their intricate details and use of color. Apart from his works in fresco, Benozzo was also known for his panel paintings, like the Portrait of a Lady, which is a half-length portrait of a woman dressed in the fashion of the 15th century. This painting, which is now housed in the National Gallery in London, showcases his skills in portrait painting and his ability to capture the personality of his subjects in his works. In conclusion, Alesso di Benozzo was a Renaissance painter who had a great influence on the art of fresco painting during his time. His works continue to be appreciated and admired for their beauty, technical skill, and emotional depth.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 41853240}

This intervention marked the beginning of Dutch colonial rule over Bali and the end of Bali's independence from outside powers. In the mid-19th century, Bali was divided into several small kingdoms, each ruled by a local king. These kingdoms were often at war with one another. In 1848, one of these kingdoms, the kingdom of Buleleng, asked for Dutch assistance in their war with the neighboring kingdom of Jembrana. The Dutch, who had already established a trading post in Bali, agreed to assist Buleleng. The Dutch military expedition arrived in Bali in August 1848 and quickly defeated the Jembrana forces. However, the Dutch did not leave Bali after the war was over. Instead, they established a permanent presence on the island and began to exert their influence on Balinese politics and society. The Dutch intervention had a significant impact on Bali's culture and way of life. The Dutch introduced Christianity to Bali and encouraged the Balinese to adopt Western ways of life. They also introduced modern technologies, such as printing presses and telegraph lines. The Dutch even established a system of education on the island. However, the Dutch colonial rule was also marked by exploitation and oppression. The Dutch forced the Balinese to work on plantations, often under brutal conditions. They also imposed high taxes and forced the Balinese to sell their produce to the Dutch at low prices. Overall, the Dutch intervention in northern Bali in 1848 was a pivotal moment in Balinese history. It marked the end of Bali's independence and the beginning of Dutch colonial rule.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Representation theory of the symmetric group\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "In mathematics, the representation theory of the symmetric group is a particular case of the representation theory of finite groups, for which a concrete and detailed theory can be obtained. This has a large area of potential applications, from symmetric function theory to problems of quantum mechanics for a number of identical particles.\n\nThe symmetric group Sn has order n!. Its conjugacy classes are labeled by partitions of n. Therefore according to the representation theory of a finite group, the number of inequivalent irreducible representations, over the complex numbers, is equal to the number of partitions of n. Unlike the general situation for finite groups, there is in fact a natural way to parametrize irreducible representations by the same set that parametrizes conjugacy classes, namely by partitions of n or equivalently Young diagrams of size n.\n\nEach such irreducible representation can in fact be realized over the integers (every permutation acting by a matrix with integer coefficients); it can be explicitly constructed by computing the Young symmetrizers acting on a space generated by the Young tableaux of shape given by the Young diagram. The dimension  of the representation that corresponds to the Young diagram  is given by the hook length formula.\n\nTo each irreducible representation \u03c1 we can associate an irreducible character, \u03c7\u03c1.\nTo compute \u03c7\u03c1(\u03c0) where \u03c0 is a permutation, one can use the combinatorial Murnaghan\u2013Nakayama rule\n. Note that \u03c7\u03c1 is constant on conjugacy classes,\nthat is, \u03c7\u03c1(\u03c0) = \u03c7\u03c1(\u03c3\u22121\u03c0\u03c3) for all permutations \u03c3.\n\nOver other fields the situation can become much more complicated.  If the field K has characteristic equal to zero or greater than n then by Maschke's theorem the group algebra KSn is semisimple. In these cases the irreducible representations defined over the integers give the complete set of irreducible representations (after reduction modulo the characteristic if necessary).\n\nHowever, the irreducible representations of the symmetric group are not known in arbitrary characteristic. In this context it is more usual to use the language of modules rather than representations. The representation obtained from an irreducible representation defined over the integers by reducing modulo the characteristic will not in general be irreducible. The modules so constructed are called Specht modules, and every irreducible does arise inside some such module. There are now fewer irreducibles, and although they can be classified they are very poorly understood. For example, even their dimensions are not known in general.\n\nThe determination of the irreducible modules for the symmetric group over an arbitrary field is widely regarded as one of the most important open problems in representation theory.\n\nLow-dimensional representations\n\nSymmetric groups \nThe lowest-dimensional representations of the symmetric groups can be described explicitly, as done in .  This work was extended to the smallest k degrees (explicitly for , and ) in , and over arbitrary fields in .  The smallest two degrees in characteristic zero are described here:\n\nEvery symmetric group has a one-dimensional representation called the trivial representation, where every element acts as the one by one identity matrix.  For , there is another irreducible representation of degree 1, called the sign representation or alternating character, which takes a permutation to the one by one matrix with entry \u00b11 based on the sign of the permutation.  These are the only one-dimensional representations of the symmetric groups, as one-dimensional representations are abelian, and the abelianization of the symmetric group is C2, the cyclic group of order 2.\n\nFor all n, there is an n-dimensional representation of the symmetric group of order n!, called the , which consists of permuting n coordinates.  This has the trivial subrepresentation consisting of vectors whose coordinates are all equal.  The orthogonal complement consists of those vectors whose coordinates sum to zero, and when , the representation on this subspace is an -dimensional irreducible representation, called the standard representation.  Another -dimensional irreducible representation is found by tensoring with the sign representation. An exterior power  of the standard representation  is irreducible provided  .\n\nFor , these are the lowest-dimensional irreducible representations of Sn \u2013 all other irreducible representations have dimension at least n.  However for , the surjection from S4 to S3 allows S4 to inherit a two-dimensional irreducible representation.  For , the exceptional transitive embedding of S5 into S6 produces another pair of five-dimensional irreducible representations.\n\nAlternating groups \n\nThe representation theory of the alternating groups is similar, though the sign representation disappears. For , the lowest-dimensional irreducible representations are the trivial representation in dimension one, and the -dimensional representation from the other summand of the permutation representation, with all other irreducible representations having higher dimension, but there are exceptions for smaller n.\n\nThe alternating groups for  have only one one-dimensional irreducible representation, the trivial representation.  For  there are two additional one-dimensional irreducible representations, corresponding to maps to the cyclic group of order\u00a03:  and .\n\n For , there is just one irreducible representation of degree , and this is the smallest degree of a non-trivial irreducible representation.\n For  the obvious analogue of the -dimensional representation is reducible \u2013 the permutation representation coincides with the regular representation, and thus breaks up into the three one-dimensional representations, as  is abelian; see the discrete Fourier transform for representation theory of cyclic groups.\n For , there is just one  irreducible representation, but there are the exceptional irreducible representations of dimension\u00a01.\n For , there are two dual irreducible representations of dimension 3, corresponding to its action as icosahedral symmetry.\n For , there is an extra irreducible representation of dimension 5 corresponding to the exceptional transitive embedding of A5 in\u00a0A6.\n\nTensor products of representations\n\nKronecker coefficients\n\nThe tensor product of two representations of  corresponding to the Young diagrams  is a combination of irreducible representations of ,\n\nThe coefficients  are called the Kronecker coefficients of the symmetric group.\nThey can be computed from the characters of the representations :\n\nThe sum is over partitions  of , with  the corresponding conjugacy classes.

If , then  coincides with the Littlewood-Richardson coefficient . Reduced Kronecker coefficients can be written as linear combinations of Littlewood-Richardson coefficients via a change of bases in the space of symmetric functions, giving rise to expressions that are manifestly integral although not manifestly positive. Reduced Kronecker coefficients can also be written in terms of Kronecker and Littlewood-Richardson coefficients   via Littlewood's formula\n\nConversely, it is possible to recover the Kronecker coefficients as linear combinations of reduced Kronecker coefficients.\n\nReduced Kronecker coefficients are implemented in the computer algebra system SageMath.\n\nEigenvalues of complex representations\n\nGiven an element  of cycle-type  and order , the eigenvalues of  in a complex representation of  are of the type  with , where the integers  are called the cyclic exponents of  with respect to the representation.\n\nThere is a combinatorial description of the cyclic exponents of the symmetric group (and wreath products thereof).

Symmetric groups are groups that consist of all possible permutations of a given set. For instance, the symmetric group of order three, denoted by S_3, is the group of all permutations of the elements {1, 2, 3}. Representation theory aims to understand how the symmetric group acts on various sets of objects, such as vector spaces, and how these actions relate to other areas of mathematics, such as algebraic geometry and topology. One of the main applications of representation theory of the symmetric group is in the study of combinatorics. In particular, the representation theory of the symmetric group allows for the study of generating functions, which give a unified way to represent different combinatorial objects, such as permutations, partitions, and Young tableaux. Another important application of representation theory of the symmetric group is in the study of algebraic geometry. The representations of the symmetric group can be used to construct algebraic varieties known as Schubert varieties, which are important objects in the study of flag manifolds and intersection theory. In addition, representation theory of symmetric groups is closely connected to the theory of Lie algebras and Lie groups, which are important objects in geometry and physics. The representation theory of the symmetric group provides a powerful tool for studying these objects and their interactions.

Co-written and co-produced by frontman Mick Hucknall, it makes extensive use of a sample of Dutch duo the Goodmen's 1993 hit \"Give It Up\". It became Simply Red's first and only  1 single on the UK Singles Chart, staying at the top for four weeks in September and October 1995, and was also a chart hit in mainland Europe and Australia, but failed to generate long-term success in North America.\n\nBackground and release\nWhen \"Fairground\" went straight to number-one in its first week on the UK Singles Chart, it had already been released to UK radio stations almost a month before, via satellite with the first promotional copies following a few days later. The single was placed in heavy rotation on Top 40 radio stations, which resulted in it reaching the top of the airplay charts, a position that was held for three weeks. When the single was released to the public on 18 September 1995, it had already been the most played record on British radio.\n\nComposition\nProducer Andy Wright has said that for Fairground, Mick Hucknall wanted to do a Brazilian, carnival-style track. Whilst Mick was at the dentist for two hours, Andy had the idea to sample a record that he knew of: Give It Up by The Goodmen, which in-turn sampled Fanfarra (Cabua-le-le) by S\u00e9rgio Mendes. To round out the track, Fritz McIntyre played the house-style piano element, Ian Kirkham used the EWI (electronic wind instrument) to play the clarinet-style part, and Andy Wright made the wobbly, dreamy sound heard in the verses.\n\nCritical reception\nSwedish newspaper Aftonbladet noted the \"hot rhythms and odd harmonies\" of the song, adding that the album \"would have needed even more such songs\". AllMusic editor William Ruhlmann said that Mick Hucknall \"opts for a Latin-tinged sound that ends up evoking Herb Alpert more than Milton Nascimento\". Another editor, Jon O'Brien deemed the song \"a mesmerizing fusion of tribal rhythms and ambient chillout pop\". Larry Flick from Billboard described it as an \"expectedly romantic soul tune\", adding that \"fueled by his now instantly familiar voice, the track combines old-school warmth with street-smart percussion that is largely derived from samples of \"Give It Up\" by the Goodmen.

The reviewer added, \"No wonder radio has leapt on this, a charmingly-delivered song which couples instant commerciality in the tune stakes with a hip tribal backing. Headed straight for the summit.\" Alan Jones said, \"Despite its heavily syncopated underpinning, it is a stylish and straightforward pop song with Mick Hucknall's usual high calibre vocal and an instantly commercial chorus.\" James Hamilton from the magazine's RM Dance Update called it \"attractive\". People Magazine'''s reviewer wrote that the \"energetic\" song \"combines soulful abandon with tribal ecstasy.\" David Gaskey from The Rice Thresher described it as \"an innovative, futuristic jazz/pop song inspired by a popular fairground outside of Milan.\" Mark Sutherland from Smash Hits stated that Hucknall \"still has a lovely singing voice\". However, he felt the song \"sort of tinkles along merrily without really going anywhere.\"\n\nChart performance\nIt was the first and only single by the group to reach No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart. It spent four weeks at the top, and fourteen weeks in the top 40. The track also reached No. 1 in Ireland and Italy and peaked within the top 10 in more than 10 countries, including Australia, Germany, New Zealand and Zimbabwe. A remix by Soulshock and Karlin was included on the US single release and received moderate success on R&B radio but failed to chart on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at No. 14 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100.\n\nIn 2012, \"Fairground\" was ranked No. 47 in NMEs list of the \"50 best-selling tracks of the 90s\", adding: \"Shamelessly lifting the clattering samba percussion from The Goodmen's 'Give It Up' (but giving due credit), Mick Hucknall greeted his post-'Stars' future with a mid-tempo ballad that sounded like an on-the-money dance track.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Netball in Africa\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Netball is a popular women's sport in parts of Africa. Several African nations are ranked amongst the top thirty in the world. As of August 2016, South Africa was ranked number Five, Malawi was ranked number Six, Uganda was ranked Seven, Zambia was ranked Sixteenth, Botswana was ranked twentieth, Zimbabwe was ranked Twenty-first and Swaziland was ranked Thirtieth in the world.\n\nSouth Africa\n\nNetball is one of the most popular women's participation sports in South Africa. While participation rates are high, there is no sense of collective identity by players as netballers and being part of a national netball community. In 2002, 40% of African girls rated netball as their favourite sport.  Many African girls claimed netball as their favourite sport even if they had never played it.\n\nThe history of South Africa's netball involvement mirrors that of other sports played in the country such as rugby union. South Africa was involved with the international netball community early in the sport's history, taking part in the 1960 meeting of Commonwealth countries in Sri Lanka to standardise the rules for the game. South Africa's international involvement was suspended because of apartheid era policies. In 1969, South Africa was expelled from competing internationally in netball. Other countries turned down tours to South Africa. Some countries, including England and New Zealand, continued to occasionally compete against South Africa, which led to their national players also being banned from international competitions. When they rejoined the community in the 1990s, internal racial tensions continued to plague the sport on the local level.\n\nIn 1994, the national team had their first international tour after a 20-year absence from international competition. The success of the South African Springboks in the 1995 Rugby World Cup had a positive impact on support for other South African national teams at international competitions, including the nation's appearance at the 1995 Netball World Championships. South Africa provided a major upset when they beat New Zealand in pool play during the tournament, with South Africa finishing second behind Australia. In 1995, the South African Police Service (SAPS) held its first National Netball Championships in Pretoria. The development of SAPS netball was not taken seriously until 1999 when they affiliated to Netball South Africa as an associated member. The Southern African Development Community has a sport competition with over 600 correctional officers from member countries participating. The 2000 national championships were held in Cape Town. In 2000, New Zealand's national side toured South Africa for the first time. The two countries played three test matches and New Zealand won them all. In 2001, a Tri-Nations Series was launched between Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, which was also won by New Zealand.\n\nBotswana\n\nNetball is primarily played by women in Botswana. Girls are introduced into the game at primary schools, as part of the school curriculum. Men have traditionally served as officials, coaches and administrators for the sport. They also had their own teams. This started to change in the 2000s, with men only teams having been discontinued in favour of mixed gendered teams. The Botswana Netball Association is the national organisation responsible for netball in Botswana. It was founded in the 1970s. It is a member of IFNA and COSANA. Botswana has 30 local graded umpires and 22 locally trained coaches who have been certified by Netball South Africa. Botswana competed in the annual Confederation of Southern African Netball Associations (COSANA) tournament in 2008. Spar \u2013 \u201cGood for You\u201d Netball League is the most important national netball competition in Botswana. Naming rights for the league were given to Sar in 2010. The league is divided into two divisions, north and south. Games for the 2010 season began on 22 May. The league championships were held on 27 November 2010 at the BONA Courts in Gaborone. As of 2016, the women's national team was ranked number twentieth in the world.\n\nMalawi\n\nNetball is the most popular women's sport in Malawi. The Malawi word for netball is mpira wa manja, where Mpira means \"Ball\". This name links the sport to women and those who are responsible for taking care of their families. Malawi's national team is called the Queens. In 1992, the ADMARC Tigresses won the Southern African Netball Associations trophy. A Malawian player was also named the best player in that tournament. In April 2008, Lesotho hosted the Malawi Under-21 national netball team. The match was part of the annual Confederation of Southern African Netball Associations (COSANA) tournament. In 2011, high-profile national player Mary Waya retired from the national team to take up a position as national U20 coach. That year, goal shooter Mwayi Kumwenda received a scholarship to play in the Victorian Netball League in Australia, becoming Malawi's first netball export player. Kumwenda joined the Mainland Tactix in 2014 to become the 1st African Import player into the ANZ Championship and the team has confirmed their wish to see her return for the 2015 season.  As of 2016, the women's national team was ranked number six in the world.\n\nTanzania\n\nNetball was one of the most popular sports in Tanzania. The sport was introduced to the country after World War I, when the country was under British colonial rule. The sport was intended for leisure and first played in schools. For this reason, almost all primary schools in the country have a court. Recruitment for the national team and other high level teams started at that level. The Netball Association of Tanzania (CHANETA) was created in 1966. Women have historically dominated in leadership positions in CHANETA but men are still involved, especially in roles like coaching. During the 1970s and 1980s, there was a push by the International Olympic Committee and the British Council to promote sport and women's sport in Tanzania. Despite netball being the most popular women's sport at the time, no investment was made into the sport. Netball's popularity declined during the 1990s as a result of economic liberalisation. Courts were not maintained, leagues were closed and there were fewer competitions. Attempts to raise netball's popularity in the country again have been hampered by the fact that sport is culturally more acceptable for men. Top level teams in the country, prior to the 1990s, have included Tanzania Harbour Authority, and Tanzania Postal and Telecommunication. Tanzania's national team is called the Taifa Queens. In their opening match in the NTUC Fairprice Foundation Nations Cup 2010, against Singapore, they won 52\u201336. Mwanaidi Hassan was the team's star player in the tournament. Some of the top performances for the Tanzania national netball team include third place at the 2010 Nations Cup. As of 2016, the women's national team was not ranked in the world.\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography", "machine_text": "Netball in Africa Netball is a popular sport that is played in different countries across the world. In Africa, netball has gained significant popularity and is now played by millions of people. Netball was introduced to Africa in the early 1920s, during the colonial era and has since grown to be one of the most popular sports in the continent. History of Netball in Africa Netball was first introduced to Africa by British colonizers who introduced the sport as a way of keeping their soldiers physically fit. The first recorded netball game on the continent took place in Kenya in 1920. The sport quickly became popular in other African countries, such as Uganda, Zimbabwe, and South Africa. Today, the International Netball Federation recognizes 35 African nations as members who are actively involved in the sport. The Growth of Netball in Africa Netball has grown in popularity in Africa, with many individuals playing the sport in schools, colleges, and universities, and at a national level. The sport is also played by adults, with organized leagues and tournaments in many African countries. The African Netball Championships The African Netball Championships is a major international tournament that takes place in Africa every four years. The tournament brings together Africa's best netball teams to compete for the title of African champions. The tournament has been held since 1976 and attracts thousands of netball fans from across the continent. Netball and Women Empowerment Netball has played a significant role in female empowerment in Africa. The sport has provided opportunities for young women to participate in sports and improve their physical fitness, self-esteem, and confidence. Many notable African women, including former President of Malawi Joyce Banda and former South African Deputy President Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, are former netball players. Netball in Africa has come a long way since its introduction in the 1920s. Today, the sport plays a significant role in African culture, bringing people together from different parts of the continent. With the ongoing growth and development of the sport, netball is expected to continue to be a popular sport in Africa for many years to come.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 31319431}

The race was the second to be held at the track during the 1983 Winston Cup Series, with the other being the 1983 World 600. Bruton Smith and Curtis Turner began building the track in 1959, and despite numerous delays, the track was finished in 1960 for the inaugural World 600.\n\nRace report\nThere were 40 drivers on the grid; 39 of them were American while Trevor Boys was the only Canadian. Sterling Marlin would rack up a last-place finish due to an engine failure on lap 53 out of the 334 being raced that day. Richard Petty defeated Darrell Waltrip by 3.1 seconds in front of 118,000 spectators in a time of three hours and thirty-four minutes; making him have 94 more wins than the next driver on the all-time wins list.

Richmond led 99 laps in the race and finished in fifth-place. The race developed a sudden and chaotic turn of events on lap 184, Darrell Waltrip managed to keep the lead for an entire lap on a field of speedy drivers before being overtaken by Bill Elliott in time for lap 185.\n\nJ.D. McDuffie would fail to qualify for this race along with Laurent Rioux (#38), Bosco Lowe, Randy Baker and Travis Tiller.\n\nOn the day of the race, 0.11 inches of precipitation were recorded around the speedway.\n\nFollowing the last caution flag and pit stops of the race, Darrell Waltrip, driving Junior Johnson's #11 Chevy led the race over Tim Richmond in the #27 Raymond Beadle Pontiac after the restart with 23 laps to go. Richard Petty was in third place. With less than ten laps to go Waltrip's car noticeably slowed and appeared to wiggle slightly exiting turn two and allowed Petty to duck below for the lead and race win. Cale Yarborough in the #28 Ranier Racing Chevy was two laps down and also passed Waltrip and was on Petty's rear bumper when the checkered flag fell. The race highlights are available to view on YouTube. No direct link is allowed.\n\nDuring victory lane celebrations a NASCAR official noticed that Petty's race car had left side tires mounted on the right side of the car, which was a violation of the rules. NASCAR sent Petty's Pontiac into the enclosed Union 76 garage inspection area for a complete engine teardown and detailed inspection.\n\nAfter a four-hour inspection of the Petty Enterprises race car, NASCAR determined the engine in Petty's car was over the limit in cubic inches as specified in the rule book. The Petty team was penalized 104 points and fined $35,000 for the rule violations involving the tires and engine. The engine was determined to be , well over the specifications in the NASCAR rulebook for 1983 which stipulated a maximum of .\n\nPetty co-crew chiefs, Robin Pemberton and Larry Pollard, stated that during the last pit stop of the race they put softer compound bias-ply tires designed for the left side of the cars on the right side of Petty's race car. The softer left side tires provided more traction when attached to the right side of a stock car and worked best when used during cool cloudy weather days which prevents the softer tires from quickly wearing out if mounted on the right side of the cars.\n\nNASCAR allowed the win to stand because the second place car of Waltrip was quickly removed from the track in the team hauler rig after the race ended and could not be inspected to determine if it was legal or not. NASCAR stated that they wanted fans to leave the track knowing who won the race.\n\nIronically, ten years earlier at this race the winning Chevy of Cale Yarborough (owned by Junior Johnson) and Richard Petty's second place Dodge were both submitted to long inspections after the race for allegedly having oversized engines.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Music of Grim Fandango\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The music for the video game Grim Fandango was composed and produced by Peter McConnell and published by LucasArts in 1998. The soundtrack is a mix of South American folk music, jazz, swing and big band sounds, for the game story filled with adventure and intrigue set in a unique combination of film noir and Mexican folklore's Day of the Dead. The soundtrack garnered critical acclaim and remained subject of positive reviews and inclusion in critics' rankings for the two decades after its first release. The soundtrack was praised both as a stand-alone musical experience, as well as for its outstanding contribution to the overall game experience; capturing the spirit of the game,  \"gluing\" the story together, and becoming \"integral\" to the success of the game.\n\nA Compact disc (CD) soundtrack was released simultaneously with the game in 1998. The soundtrack was remastered and orchestrated, and re-released in 2015. In 2019, celebrating its 20th anniversary, it was also released in vinyl format.\n\nThe score was awarded GameSpot 1998 \"Best PC Music Award\". It was also nominated for the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences' \"Outstanding Achievement in Sound and Music\". Years after its original release, the soundtrack has also been included in lists of all-time best video game soundtracks.\n\nBackground and context\n\nThe game\n\nGrim Fandango is a graphic adventure video game directed by Tim Schafer and released by LucasArts in 1998. Set in the Mexican folklore's Land of the Dead and with a strong film noir twist, the story follows Department of Death's travel agent Manny Calavera who acts as a guide for recently departed souls as they travel through the Land of the Dead on their way to their final destinations. This land, meant to be only a place of passage to the final heavenly destination, has been settled by undeserving souls turning it into a land full of film noir-inspired crime and corruption, and making the travel of many departed souls more difficult and treacherous. The player follows Manny on a mission to save Mercedes \"Meche\" Colomar, a good soul thrust into and trapped in this corrupted world.\n\nThe game is one of the most acclaimed adventure games of all time, considered the last great adventure game to be released during the golden age of the adventure game genre. While composer Peter McConnell himself credits the outstanding directorial work of Tim Schafer, critics emphasized that one of the key components in the excellence of the game was McConnell's outstanding soundtrack.\n\nTeam and collaborations\nTim Schafer, Peter McConnell and other members of the development team had had long and overlapping careers from previous projects at LucasArts. For McConnell, who had joined LucasArts at the urging of Michael Land, another acclaimed composer of LucasArts, that included working on the music of other notable computer games, including Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge (1991), Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis (1992), Sam & Max Hit the Road (1993), Day of the Tentacle (1993), Full Throttle (1995).\n\nIn composing for Grim Fandango, McConnell benefitted from having been a big jazz and film noir fan since his college time. He had his first experience in composing jazz in his work for Monkey Island; a team of composers (Michael Land, Clint Bajakian, and McConnell) split their work by the several islands in which the story of the game was set, and within McConnell's island (named Booty), he experimented with clarinet sounds.\n\nMcConnell and Schafer's professional collaboration started with Day of the Tentacle, then continued with Full Throttle (possibly in part due to McConnell having a rock band at the time, which suited the genre of the game). However, it was with Grim Fandango that the relationship between the two became very close and set the stage for numerous subsequent collaborations, with McConnell becoming Schafer's \"go-to man\". After both of them departed LucasArts, they collaborated on titles including Psychonauts (2005), Br\u00fctal Legend (2009), and Broken Age (2015).\n\nOriginal development\n\nInspiration and influences\n\nVery early in the process, project leader and writer Tim Schafer handed to McConnell black and white concept art of the characters sketched by Peter Chan, his collection of Humphrey Bogart films, and some vinyl records of a type Mexican folk music called Son, which McConnell described as \"very raw, using crude folk instruments\" that included hand percussion, violins, and charangos.\n\nHaving Schafer established the mood and tone of the project, McConnell said that aside from the listening material, Schafer did not give him much direction; \"In my experience, Tim leads more by inspiring than by directing\".\n\nWhen years later McConnell was asked how he reacted when he first played the game, he said that \"some games just really strike you when you first see the main character in the game environment. You think, 'Wow, this is something really different.' I remember feeling that when I first saw Manny walking around in Rubacava: 'A walking skeleton? Cool! And in this dark wet street like something from a different time, yet colorful and beautiful.'\"\n\nMcConnell also noted how the game's m\u00e9lange of themes was musically very \"potent\" as it brought together diverse music styles, including folk, noir jazz, and classic underscore. To him, the whole game felt very inspirational, as dialogue, story, and the puzzles all worked together as an \"opera\"; \"one big cohesive flow of music and voice\" that made it special to score.\n\nOf the films provided by Schafer, McConnell focussed his attention in The Maltese Falcon, The Big Sleep, Treasure of the Sierra Madre, and Casablanca; The first one scored by Adolph Deutsch and the other three by Max Steiner. He watched them \"about a hundred times\", and for the latter two being able to get copies of their scores from the Warner Brothers archives. He also acknowledged the influence of the films Glengarry Glen Ross and The City of Lost Children, the latter a French sci-fi/fantasy movie that informed the oceanic part of the game.\n\nOne South American record that was influential was a Peruvian-style record by Gustavo Santaolalla titled Ronrocco released at the time, that made heavy use of charangos. It also coincided with Tim Schafer's brother having brought one such instrument from a trip to Mexico. All this led to McConnell eventually incorporating the charango as one of the unique sounds of the score, along with the Andean flutes quena and tarka. Despite the strong Latin American influences and themes, McConnell decided to not attempt to compose a particularly ethnic score, but to be \"organic\" and to \"evoke a texture that was real\".\n\nMcConnell explained how, since his college days, Duke Ellington had been a \"huge influence\" for him and kept a headshot in his office studio at LucasArts. For this project, McConnell listened to Ellington's opus copiously. Finally, for ocean-related music, McConnell read scores of several Debussy works.\n\nTime and place had an important influence as well; McConnell was drawn to and inspired by the vibrant and diverse culture (musical and otherwise) of the San Francisco Mission District, which he called the \"crown jewel\" of the city that included rock clubs, jazz clubs, taquerias with mariachis bands, and Mexican folklore.\n\nComposition process\n\nWhen later interviewed, McConnell noted his satisfaction of being given ample lead time to compose and produce the score; he first began to work on the project in early 1997, about a year and a half before the game's release. He developed three types of musical pieces: event-triggered episodes, ambient pieces, and underscoring for cutscenes. Tim Schafer's guidance and the cultures that shaped the game were the basis for the composition.\n\nIn order to create a soundtrack that would follow the story of the game and mesh with the different settings within it, McConnell and his team created a digital interface system of little buttons that represented places in the game as a way to visually represent the score. They then recorded Schafer talking about the game and turned it into little snippets assigned to those plot points. Each point could then be clicked and hear Schafer's explanations of it. This was done using LucasArts iMUSE proprietary adaptive music system that McConnell himself had co-created with Michael Land a few years earlier.\n\nMcConnell would then come up with a theme by humming a tune, record it in a cassette, play it back to Schafer, and eventually replace the plot points narration with those tunes.  Then they developed a MIDI score to serve as a \"mock-up\", leading to the recording of the final score that would include live musicians for some parts.\n\nRather than fully develop each piece one at a time, his approach was to create a short sketch for each situation in the game of about fifteen seconds long and then move on as soon as he felt he had hit the target and gotten the gist of the mood. This allowed him to be more productive, as it was easier and less stressful to later on in the process develop full pieces based on already existing sketches, instead of rushing to develop completely novel compositions from scratch as the completion deadline neared. At his peak rate, he noted that there were weeks during which he composed as much as two minutes of finished music a day, which he considered a \"heavy regimen\".\n\nMcConnell used the limited MIDI composition palette of the time, a couple of EMU E4 samplers (with 128 MB of RAM each), a Roland GMIDI Sound Canvas, and one or two other sound modules.\n\nThemes and recording\n\nMcConnell went on to compose and produce Grim Fandangos original soundtrack, which combined an orchestral score, South American (Peruvian and Mexican) folk music, swing jazz from the noir era, jazz from other periods, bebop, and big band music. It also included some elements from traditional Russian, Celtic, Mexican, Spanish, and Indian strings cultures. In the original production, the orchestral elements of the score were digitally synthesized due to the common budgetary and technological limitations on gaming audio of the time. On the other hand, the jazz parts were recorded live, something uncommon at the time.\n\nMcConnell understood that the game's atmosphere brought together a noir story that was familiar to the Anglo-American audience, with a Latin culture that may have been less familiar. He developed the jazz score to be most recognizable, taking the culturally specific part (the Latin jazz and the Latin folk music) and weaving it into the score (\"taking it for granted rather than pointing it up\") with the goal of naturally leading the audience from their comfort zone and then make an \"unfamiliar world more familiar.\"\n\nAn example of the rich atmospheric goals of the music is recounted by the French online publication Gameblog, that described the \"Mr. Frustration\" track as \"sometimes bebop, sometimes melancholic, sweet or sensual\" and observing that \"whether led by a saxophone, a trumpet or a guitar, jazz is the predominant style of the Grim Fandango soundtrack, all reminiscent of the snug atmosphere of casinos and bars between the two world wars\". It also described \"Lost Souls' Alliance\", with its rhythmic arrangement and the use of an Andean flute, as evoking a feel of Hispanic music, with the tremolo baritone guitar reminiscent of the Western: \"a little 'rockabilly ballad' that makes us travel instantly to this corner of the planet and to that period, at the beginning of the twentieth century.\"\n\nEspecially given the disparate themes of Grim Fandango, McConnell kept the score cohesive by building it on a \"backbone\" of classic Max Steiner-style orchestral underscoring. The orchestral part was digitally created, as the team did not consider doing live orchestra because at the time \"games didn\u2019t occupy a place in the culture that could obtain that level of production.\"\n\nTo make the digital pieces sound more \"organic\" and \"not quantized\" and orchestra-like, McConnell tried to be \"very free with the tempo\" so even though he was using a sequencer, it would sound like the conductor was watching the sequences of the game during the performance, following the old-school movie scoring methods.\n\nRelease\n\nThe full length of the score within the game was about three hours long, with an approximate 110 pieces. A 43-minute version with 32 tracks was concurrently released in 1998 as a CD album, sold at the LucasArts online company store.\n\nCritical reception\n\nThe soundtrack was very well received at its original release, and it continued to receive praise years after, often considered one of the best game soundtracks of all time.\n\nAt its original release, IGN called it a \"beautiful soundtrack that you'll find yourself listening to even after you're done with the game\". SEMO said \"the compositions and performances are so good that listening to this album on a stand-alone basis can make people feel like they're in a bar back then\". RPGFan said, \"the pieces are beautifully composed, wonderfully played (...). has a stellar soundtrack with music that easily stands alone outside the context of the game. This CD was an absolute pleasure to listen to and comes highly recommended.\" Game Revolution in its game review praised it as one of the \"most memorable soundtracks ever to grace the inside of a cranial cavity where an eardrum used to be.\" 20 years later ABC noted retrospectively that since the original release of the soundtrack it had been consistently praised; despite the technical limitations imposed on its original production \"it was still considered [at the time of its release] a stellar album to listen to, even without the context of the game, which speaks to the composer\u2019s tremendous skill and musicality.\"\n\nYears after the release, the soundtrack continued to receive critical acclaim. Kotaku noted in 2011 that \"it remains as killer today as it was when the game launched in 1998.\" PC Gamer in its 2014 list of Top 100 Games, acclaimed Grim Fandango for including \"one of the best soundtracks in PC gaming history\". In 2017 Fact magazine also listed it as one of the \"100 best video game soundtracks of all time\". Kotaku noted that even among other lauded games that were successful in incorporating jazz in their scores to great advantage (EarthBound, The Operative: No One Lives Forever, and L.A. Noire), Grim Fandangos stood apart. Further comparing it with L.A. Noire, Kotaku added that it \"doesn't come close to the variety and vivaciousness of McConnell's Grim Fandango score. From the dark, plunger-muted swing of 'Swanky Maximo' to the mellow, guitar-accompanied lobby-trombone of the appropriately named 'Frustration Man', it's simply good, video game-related or no.\" It further lauded \"the epic saxophone of 'She Sailed Away', the chord-less free jazz of 'Blue Casket Bop', or the menacing bari sax/bass clarinet duet of 'Rubacava'\" as highlights of an overall outstanding score.  Alternative Magazine Online in 2015 noted that upon its original release it \"instantly became one of the greatest video game soundtracks of all time\" and that the remastered version went even further.\n\nWhen the game and its soundtrack were remastered and re-released, they also garnered praise. Radio host Emily Reese called the score \"amazing\", further adding how she really enjoyed how McConnell wrote the various sections of the orchestra: \"It seems [McConnell was] able to capitalize on really specific characteristics of the instruments; like you'll have the brass play in a militaristic style, or you'll have the bassoons or baby base clarinets being very mischievous, strings will do something where they are trembling(...).\" Fact noted of the game that the game returned twenty years later in a new edition \"to the masterpiece-accolades (and sales) it deserved all along. Its remastering kept the soul of the game intact while polishing what needed to be polished: the graphics, animation, controls, and most importantly, the music.\"\n\nSeveral critics also noted how the music was a key contribution to enhancing the overall experience of the game. For example, at the time of the original release Computer Gaming Worlds review remarked that \"a musical score (...) accompanies the art to complete the experience.\" 20 years later, The Ringer noted that the best example in the game of the blending of cultures was its soundtrack, by combining elements of an orchestral score, with more traditional South American strings, and the jazz and swing music of the film noir era, becoming \"commonly celebrated as one of the best video game soundtracks of all time. Great adventure games such as Grim Fandango feature worlds so cohesive and rich with detail that they\u2019re transportive for the player and McConnell\u2019s soundtrack is the glue that binds the game's elements.\" Kotaku noted upon revisiting the game in 2011 how \"I was struck by just how much McConnell's soundtrack (...) elevates the basic game.\" in 2015 Fact magazine noted that \"few soundtracks have ever felt more integral to the success of a video game\" and that \"the game\u2019s blend of styles would never have held together so well if it weren\u2019t for McConnell\u2019s masterful ability to fuse Mexican folk music with Duke Ellington-era big band jazz and noir scores in the spirit of Adolph Deutsch.\"\n\nAwards and rankings\n\nIn 1999's Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the soundtrack was nominated in the category of \"Outstanding Achievement in Sound and Music\". It was also lauded by GameSpot, which awarded it the \"Best PC Music awards\", and included it in the \"Ten Best PC Game Soundtracks\" list in 1999.\n\nAt the time of the original release of Grim Fandango and its soundtrack, few video game music awards existed. Other video game music awards, such as from BAFTA or the Game Audio Network Guild, began to be awarded in the 2000s, and therefore Grim Fandangos soundtrack at the time of its release could not opt to compete for them. However, since then it has been included in several rankings of best video game music.\n\nRemastered soundtrack\n\nBackground and context\n\nMcConnell had made the most of the resources he had for the score's original production, which meant devoting more of them where they could make the greatest impact while cutting corners in other areas. Even though, for example, he wished he had been able to find a better-sounding sampled piano, he did not regret not recording an acoustic piano as it would have meant compromising the quality of more important parts given the time and budget constraints. However, he had long wished to revisit the score if the opportunity arose, to fix and enhance the various aspects that had not been viable during the original production. He noted that \"Grim\u2019s music was a little bit ahead of [its] time\", and it suffered because of that. He also lamented that just two years after the release of Grim Fandango, orchestral recording in gaming took off.\n\nThe Grim Fandango game had been originally developed and published by LucasArts, which in 2012 was acquired by Disney. In 2013, Disney made the strategic decision to turn LucasArts into a publisher-only of video games, and licensing out its intellectual property. Tim Schafer, who had also long been eager to revisit and re-release the game and make it available to new platforms and to new generations, seized the opportunity and was able to acquire the rights to the game, in partnership with Sony.\n\nSo when in 2013 Schafer offered McConnell the unique opportunity to remaster the soundtrack, McConnell was ready to jump in. He believed that while the original jazz music came out well, the orchestral part, done with 1997-era digital samples and a limited budget, did not fully match his vision. He believed that remaking the latter would make the greatest difference: \"If you want to do something really great with this score, biggest bang for the buck is going to be to take those orchestral movements and record them live.\"\n\nWith the support of staff (who McConnell called \"friends of Grim\" by either having worked on the original project or had grown up with it as a favorite game) at Disney Interactive, LucasArts, and Sony Computer Entertainment, Schafer's Double Fine studio worked to remaster the game and re-released it in 2015.\n\nData recovery\n\nThe remastering of the soundtrack started with the retrieval of the original 16-year-old data, in a process dubbed by Polygon as \"digital archeology\". The music tracks were on archaic DLT backup tapes stored in the LucasArts/Disney archives. Rob Cowles, a marketer at LucasArts was credited for saving the assets while LucasArts was being acquired by Disney in 2012. Subsequently, Derek Williams was credited for finding them.\n\nOnce the original tapes were found, the next challenge was to retrieve the data from within them. McConnell remarked how their retrieval was a technical feat requiring specialized hardware and expertise Jory Prum (who then did the sound mixing for the orchestral pieces) spent two months recovering the data, with the use of DLT drive, an old Mac with a SCSI drive, and an old piece of software called Retrospect Remote. The fact that McConnell was able to open a Pro Tools session from 1997 on a new version of Pro Tools also proved key in being able to use the files. Except for the anecdotal disappearance of two cymbal hits, this process succeeded in recovering all the data of the three-hour score. McConnell called this recovery process \"a chain of miracles\" since \"if any of the links had not held up, we would have had very little to work with at all.\" McConnell further gratefully credited the retrieval success to numerous people who were devoted fans of the game, calling it a \"labor of love\".\n\nImprovements and re-recording\n\nJust like with the original game development, project lead Tim Schafer had very little input into the soundtrack's re-mastering, except that \"he was very supportive of the effort to make the music the highest quality possible.\"\n\nGiven the unique opportunity to re-visit a project first developed 17 years earlier in his career, McConnell was asked how different would the soundtrack be if he had developed it from scratch at the time of remastering. McConnell noted that if he were to start from scratch he would have taken the exact same approach, with the exception of the \"crazy tempo\" changes that he had never thought a real orchestra would have to perform; some parts were originally played live into a sequencer without regard for bar lines and retrospectively he would have taken a different approach. He also noted that there had been a small number of things that had long \"bugged\" him from the original release (\"the occasional klunker, or ham-fisted move\") that he finally got the chance to fix them. However, overall, \"the pleasant surprise in the process was how well much of the original material held up\".\n\nTo stay within the budget, McConnell felt he had to choose carefully which pieces would get the most attention and how. After the original Pro Tools project files were recovered, he found that some of the digital samples he had used originally did not sound good, and the team opted to re-mix, re-sample, add additional tracks, and re-orchestrate different parts of the score.\n\nThese tasks were assigned to three teams: an audio team at Sony recorded live tracks and remixed 45 minutes of jazz tunes (which included a few new live parts and some new solos); another team at Pyramind Studios in San Francisco replaced old samples with better sounds in another 45 minutes of music and re-mixed all of the cut scenes in six languages; and finally the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra (MSO) recorded about 30 minutes of orchestral music.\n\nMelbourne Symphony Orchestra\n\nThe involvement of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra (MSO) in the orchestration of the Grim Fandango soundtrack grew out of several prior collaborations that McConnell had had with the orchestra. The connection first happened when Special Projects Manager of the orchestra Andrew Pogson reached out to McConnell in early 2013 to do a pops concert performance of Grim Fandango. At the time, McConnell had been working on the soundtrack for Broken Age, a new adventure game by Tim Schafer. Pogson, having been a financial backer for Broken Age, pushed to have MSO record that score, making it the first time for the MSO to be involved in such a project. After that collaboration coming to fruition, working together in orchestrating Grim Fandango became \"the next logical step\" and it felt \"like working with old friends\". McConnell praised MSO, for their outstanding level of musicianship and focus and care; how they worked well together and reinforced yet again his notion from his early days in LucasArts that having a great team was of the highest value.\n\nDuring the original production of the score, McConnell had never imaged that it would one day be re-recorded with a live orchestra. That meant that his composition was unconstrained by considerations of flow and changes of tempo that a real orchestra would have to contend with. Rather, in order to make it sound more lively during the original digital production, McConnell had intentionally incorporated many tempo changes. While it would have been possible to do live recordings of full songs with big tempo changes, it would have required an intensive rehearsal, meaning more time and costs. So when the opportunity came to re-record with the MSO, McConnell tried to save time by planning the recording by breaking cues into smaller segments, recording those one at a time, and then put them back together like a puzzle.\n\nPyramind studios\n\nPyramind studios composers Clint Bajakian and Jeremy Garren imported McConnell's original audio mixes into Cubase 7 along with MIDI tracks that were assigned to modern sample libraries residing on two slave PCs running Vienna Ensemble Pro loaded with leading sample libraries. Bajakian also added live classical guitar parts that were not covered in 1998 using the same instrument he played back then. The team faced the challenge to adjust MIDI parameters to maximize realism and sonic quality while preserving McConnell's original artistic intent.\n\nTo accomplish this, Garren noted that \u201cthis meant focused attention to mixing, EQ'ing, and programming articulation data on an individual instrument basis to bring each phrase and gesture in line with Pete's original intentions. It meant a constant back and forth with the original music and imagining, \u2018What should this sound like today?\u2019\u201d and Bajakian added, \u201cFor us to do this right, we had to also wrap our minds around the \u2018extra-musical\u2019 content of the music \u2013 the concepts, the references, the puns \u2013 the ideas that interact like characters in a play\u201d.\n\nOutcome\n\nMcConnell noted that the one element that he and his team did not get \"so perfectly\" in the original release was the film noir orchestral part and that that was what they were \"really able to do in a big way\" with the remastering work. He also noted that between the remixes and the live symphony \"it turned out to be the score the way it was always meant to be heard\", also adding that \"I have to say I'm glad I took extra care on the themes because I feel they were really able to blossom in the new live recordings.\"\n\nMcConnell estimated that he put in himself about 800 hours into the remastering project, in arranging, sample replacement, preparing for orchestration, mixing, and reviewing the music, resulting in over 2 hours of music that was completely overhauled, in addition to the 45 minutes of music the team had already recorded live in the original version. The outcome was described by McConnell as a score that had been \"re-arranged, re-voiced, re-orchestrated, re-recorded, re-mixed, re-mastered and \u2013 most of all \u2013 retrieved\" (and in a couple of key spots, even \u201cre-composed\").\n\nThe stand-alone remastered soundtrack was released concurrently with the remastered game in 2015 (17 years after the original release). The soundtrack was distributed under Nile Rodgers' label Sumthing Else. In 2019, to celebrate the 20th anniversary, the remastered soundtrack was released in vinyl.\n\nTrack listings\n\nReleases\n\nThe first stand-alone release of the soundtrack was in a CD in 1998. It contained 32 tracks totalling 43 minutes from the about 3 hours of the full length of the game score. An extended version of 128 tracks was later available online. 17 years later, in 2015, the remastered soundtrack was released. It was produced under Nile Rodgers' label Sumthing Else. It had a standard release of 37 tracks, as well as a Director's Cut with 14 extra tracks (the latter sold exclusively through Sumthing Else). It included the original score from the LucasArts archives, new compositions by Peter McConnell and new orchestral arrangements, as well as new extended versions of jazz pieces re-mixed at Sony Computer Entertainment America. In 2019, celebrating the 20th anniversary of the original release of the game, the soundtrack was released for the first time in vinyl format. It included all the songs of the 2015-release of the Director's Cut.Main albumsCompilations'''\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Name\n! Date\n! Label\n! Format\n! Catalog\n! Notes\n!

Around 2015 McConnell prepared a suite of music for performance by the Queensland Symphony Orchestra. Celebrating its 20th anniversary, a live performance of script-reading with live music was performed at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2018. Later the same year, an evening gala was organized in tribute of the soundtrack during the inaugural edition of the Game Music Festival in the National Forum of Music of Poland. Parts of the score was performed live, with 100 pages of musical arrangements prepared by Bartosz Pernal in cooperation with McConnell, who attended and performed in the event. In 2018, Grim Fandango main theme song was one of the pieces performed by the Danish National Symphony Orchestra and subsequently included in the album Gaming in Symphony.\n\nLegacyGrim Fandangos soundtrack is considered a classic, receiving critical acclaim in its original release of 1998, and remaining a critics' favorite in ensuing years, including 17 years later in its remastered re-release in 2015. Its ability to \"glue\" together the game's elements and \"elevate\" it is seen as one of the high points of the video game music genre.\n\nThe Grim Fandango score remained decades later one of McConnell's most famous scores (With \"Mr. Frustration Man\" or \"Swanky Maximino\" being some of his favorite pieces because of the solo performances). For McConnell personally, he saw this as a special project in his musical career, calling Grim Fandango \"almost like an opera\" for how integrated the music was with the story. The project cemented a close working relationship between Schafer and McConnell that continued for decades after their work together at LucasArts.\n\nThe fact that the soundtrack had stood the test of time, was attributed by McConnell to a combination of \"story and the world are so rich and potent, and deal with timeless themes on a level rarely attained in a game\", the rich musical heritage of film noir scores and freedom of jazz, the talent of the musicians inspired by the musical effervescence of San Francisco's mission district; \"The score was literally in the air, like it was meant to be. All you had to do was catch it.\" And while the video game soundtracks are meant to be created in support of the larger goal of an integrated interactive experience of dialogue, graphics, story, and sound, Grim Fandangos soundtrack also stands on its own, with critics noting that it can be appreciated independently of the game it was created for. The music was also performed for live audiences.\n\nThe soundtrack is also notable for being one of the best examples of early adaptive music systems. With McConnell having created tracks for almost every location and character in Grim Fandango, these were weaved into a continuous sequence of music, seamlessly transitioning to different pieces as the player progressed through the game, making it the most cinematic soundtrack of any LucasArts game. This was accomplished with the use of the pioneering iMUSE software, previously created by McConnell and Michael Land, and it heralded the age of dynamic and cinematic music experiences in video games.\n\nPersonnel\nMcConnell dubbed the Grim Fandango score as \"the mission district score\", as virtually all the performers and a lot of the inspiration came from it.\n\nOriginal release\n\nProduction team\nPeter McConnell \u2013 composer, producer\nJeff Kliment \u2013 music engineering, mixing, lead sound design\nHans Christian Reumsch\u00fcssel \u2013 additional music production\n Michael Land \u2013 sound production supervision\n\nPerformers\nRalph Carney \u2013 clarinet, bass clarinet, contrabass clarinet, slide clarinet, baritone and bass saxes\nSheldon Brown \u2013 clarinet and bass clarinet\nPaul Hanson \u2013 bassoon, clarinet, alto and tenor saxes\nBill Ortiz \u2013 trumpet\nDan Armstrong \u2013 trombone\nShane Norman \u2013 trombone\nHans Christian \u2013 cello\nClint Bajakian \u2013 classical guitar and melodica\nPeter McConnell \u2013 electric guitar, charango and violin (tango piece)\nDerek Jones \u2013 bass\nPaul van Wageningen \u2013 drums\nJorge Molina \u2013 quena\nGeresh Cruden \u2013 tablas\n\nRemastered soundtrack \u2013 Additional credits\n\nProduction\nAnthony Caruso \u2013 mixing (Sony Computer Entertainment America)\nJonathan Mayer \u2013 mix project manager (Sony Computer Entertainment America) \nCamden Stoddard \u2013 mixing music with ambient sound effects for in-game play (Double Fine Productions)\nClint Bajakian \u2013 midi re-orchestration and mixing, cutscenes mixing (Pyramind studios)\nJeremy Garren \u2013 midi re-orchestration and mixing, cutscenes mixing (Pyramind studios)\nJonathan Buch \u2013 midi re-orchestration and mixing \nMike Forst \u2013 cutscenes mixing (Pyramind studios), production manager\nJonathan Buch \u2013 production assistant (Pyramind studios)\nOphylia Wispling \u2013 production assistant (Pyramind studios)\n\nMelbourne Symphony recordings\nPerformed by the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra\nBrett Kelly \u2013 conductor\nAndrew Pogson \u2013 special projects manager\nHaig Burnell \u2013 ABC producer \nChris Lawson \u2013 ABC sound engineer\nNick Mierisch \u2013 ABC sound engineer\nRussell Thompson \u2013 ABC sound engineer\nKarim Elmahmoudi \u2013 orchestration\nJory Prum - orchestral mixing, session engineer (Studio Jory)\nJoel Raabe - session engineer (Studio Jory)\n\nData management\nRob Cowles \u2013 original data safeguarding\nDerek Williams \u2013 original data recovery\nJory Prum \u2013 original data retrieval\n\nAlbum art\nHolly Rothrock \u2013 2019 vinyl release album art\n\n Notes \n\n References \n\nFurther reading\n \n (LucasArts' official web page for Grim Fandango'', which included commentary on the music by its composer)\n\nExternal links\nGrim Fandango Remastered: The Resurrection of Sound with composer Peter McConnell - YouTube short documentary\nE3 Coliseum: Grim Fandango featuring Jack Black (YouTube)\nPerformance of Grim Fandango's main theme by the Danish National Symphony Orchestra (YouTube)\nOriginal soundtrack listing provided by the Grim Fandango Network\nGrim Fandango original soundtrack, extended version (YouTube; 1:58:11)\nGrim Fandango live performance at GAMESCOM 2015 Cologne (organized by Video Games Live)\n\nVideo game soundtracks\nVideo games scored by Peter McConnell", "machine_text": "Music of Grim Fandango Grim Fandango, a video game created by LucasArts, was released in 1998 and has become known as a cult classic. Its unique storyline, characters and world are often cited as game highlights, but the game's music is also a praised element. The game was scored by Peter McConnell, who has also scored other LucasArts classics such as Monkey Island and Day of the Tentacle. The music in Grim Fandango is known for its blend of jazz, Latin, and film noir influences, creating an atmosphere of a 1940s film. The game's main theme, \"Grim Fandango\", features a trumpet lead by Malachi Thompson that sets the tone for the entire game. The theme is a perfect example of the game's blend of jazz, Latin and noir, with the Latin percussion giving the piece its distinct feel. The game's score has large brass sections with a constant jazz rhythm in the background that makes the player feel like they are part of an era-defining film. McConnell wanted the music to use different instruments to help the player connect to each area of the game, including the bluesy guitar that accompanied the player in the Land of the Dead. McConnell took inspiration from film composers such as Bernard Herrmann, who worked on films like Psycho and Taxi Driver. Fans have also noticed the similarities between Grim Fandango's music and noir films such as Casablanca, due to the game's timeless themes of love, power and betrayal. Years after the game's initial release, its music has become a staple in video game soundtracks and fan communities alike. The game's score was released on vinyl in 2018 by Double Fine Productions, McConnell's current studio. The game's music has scored many videos on social media features and the theme occasionally makes it onto video game music lists compiled by critics. Overall, the music in Grim Fandango is a fundamental part of its outstanding reception in the gaming community. It will continue to be remembered as one of the best video game soundtracks of all time, as part of a game that has become a cult classic.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 62707426}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Batsto Village, New Jersey\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Batsto Village (or simply Batsto) is a historic unincorporated community located on CR 542 within Washington Township in Burlington County, New Jersey, United States. It is located in Wharton State Forest in the south central Pine Barrens, and a part of the Pinelands National Reserve. It is listed on the New Jersey and National Register of Historic Places, and is administered by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection's Division of Parks & Forestry. The name is derived from the Swedish bastu, bathing place (also the Swedish word for Finnish sauna); the first bathers were probably the Lenni Lenape Native Americans.\n\nHistory\nIn 1766, Charles Read, a well-known ironmaster, built the Batsto Iron Works along the Batsto River on the site of the future village. The area had an abundance of bog ore which could be mined from the area's streams and rivers, and wood from the area's forests was harvested for charcoal for smelting the ore.  The rivers, despite their modest drop, were also harnessed for iron making.\n\nIn 1773, John Cox bought the Iron Works, which produced cooking pots, kettles, and other household items. Batsto manufactured supplies for the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War.\n\nIn 1779, the Iron Works manager, Joseph Ball, bought the works and in 1784, his uncle, William Richards, bought a controlling interest. Over the next 91 years, the Richards family built most of the structures in the village.  Richards was ironmaster until he retired in 1809. He was succeeded by his son, Jesse Richards, who ran the operation until his death in 1854 and was followed in turn by his son Thomas H. Richards.  In the mid-19th century, demand for iron declined and Batsto turned to glassmaking, though without lasting success. Soon Batsto was in bankruptcy.\n\nIn 1876, Philadelphia businessman Joseph Wharton purchased Batsto along with a substantial number of other properties in the area. He improved many of the village buildings and was involved in a number of forestry and agricultural projects, including cranberry farming and a sawmill. After his death in 1909, his properties in the Pine Barrens were managed by the Girard Trust Company in Philadelphia.\n\nHistoric site\nStarting in 1952, the Air Force reviewed the Batsto location for an arms depot. Included in that construction was a plan for a \"trans-ocean airport\" and Congress was working on authorizing $73,523,000 for the establishment of a combined depot and air transport service. However, by 1956, the depot plans had shifted to Long Branch and the Air Force was no longer interested in this location. The state of New Jersey purchased the Wharton properties in the late 1950s and began planning the use and development of the property, allowing the few people still living in the Village to remain; in 1989 the last house was vacated.\n\nAfter the property was purchased in 1958, the plans started with the restoration of the 50-room mansion and the rebuilding of the dam for recreation on the lake. After work began the property was concurrently opened to visitors. In 1959 the historic village of Batsto became the most popular site for that year as measured by visitors relative to other state historic sites. The historic village was dedicated on May 27, 1961 at 1:30pm.\n\nIn 1961, the visitor center was started. It initially housed the office, information desk, museum and an auditorium.\n\nToday there are more than forty sites and structures, including the Batsto mansion, a sawmill, a 19th-century ore boat, a charcoal kiln, ice and milk houses, a carriage house and stable, a blacksmith and wheelwright shop, a gristmill and a general store. The Post Office is still in operation, and collectors have stamps hand-cancelled, with no zip code. The Batsto-Pleasant Mills United Methodist Church building, erected in 1808 as the Batsto-Pleasant Mills Methodist Episcopal Church, is still active as a place of worship.\n\nSee also\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Burlington County, New Jersey\nList of museums in New Jersey\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nBatsto Village\n Batsto Village at Atlas Obscura\nNew Jersey Department of Environmental Protection\u2013 Batsto Village\nBatsto Mansion and other area houses\nEarly history of the area\nHistory of the Batsto Methodist Episcopal Church\n\nWashington Township, Burlington County, New Jersey\nUnincorporated communities in Burlington County, New Jersey\nUnincorporated communities in New Jersey\nCompany towns in New Jersey\nGhost towns in New Jersey\nHistoric districts on the National Register of Historic Places in New Jersey\nMuseums in Burlington County, New Jersey\nPre-statehood history of New Jersey\nPopulated places in the Pine Barrens (New Jersey)\nLiving museums in New Jersey\nNational Register of Historic Places in Burlington County, New Jersey\nOpen-air museums in New Jersey\nPopulated places on the National Register of Historic Places", "machine_text": "Batsto Village, New Jersey is a historic site located within the Wharton State Forest in Burlington County, New Jersey, United States.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Casablanca (novella)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Casablanca is a novella written by Edgar Brau in Nevada, United States, in November\u2013December 2002. In the story, set in Buenos Aires Province, Argentina, a rich Argentine ranch owner builds a replica of Rick's Caf\u00e9 Am\u00e9ricain on his estate, with the idea of reproducing in it, by means of doubles, the most important scenes of the movie  Casablanca.\n\nPlot summary\nCasablanca begins when the narrator, who is driving his car to Mar del Plata seaside resort, is caught by a big storm. While looking for some shelter he comes across a place similar to Rick's Caf\u00e9 Am\u00e9ricain. He gets out of the car and, almost blinded by the rain, hurries to the entrance door. Just then somebody starts playing \"As Time Goes By\"  on a piano at the back of the room. The player is identical to Sam, but much older; he is wearing the same suit jacket that is shown in the film, but worn out now. In one of the corners, an old man in dark glasses, who looks like Humphrey Bogart, is dozing at a table. When the song is over, the black man starts to tell the narrator the story of the place and of the people who lived there.\n\nIt all started, he says, in the early fifties, when the owner of those lands, a rich man very similar to  Sydney Greenstreet \u2014the actor who interpreted se\u00f1or Ferrari\u2014 decides to build a replica of Rick's caf\u00e9 to reproduce in it the main scenes of the movie. With this purpose, he sends agents around the country and abroad, to look for people whose physical appearance is identical to the characters. He keeps for himself the role of Se\u00f1or Ferrari. When the cast is ready, they rehearse for some months; their voices and accents must sound like the English spoken in the original version. To imitate the black-and-white movie, everything in the place is in lighter or darker shades of grey.\n\nWhen the caf\u00e9 is opened, success is enormous. The people who visit it have the feeling they are \u201cinside\u201d the famous movie. Se\u00f1or Ferrari's dream (\u201cFerrari\u201d is the name given to the ranch owner in the story) Se\u00f1or Ferrari's dream of turning the movie Casablanca into reality has come true.\n\nSome years of splendor follow, but an epidemic of hoof-and-mouth disease and an unexpected flood affect Se\u00f1or Ferrari's property, and he goes bankrupt. He speaks with President Per\u00f3n to get a license to play for real money at the roulette wheel and the poker tables (up to that moment people pretended that they were gambling). President Per\u00f3n \u2014who had visited the place some months before and had an affair with Ilsa (Ferrari's lover) \u2014 agrees to it.\n\nThe caf\u00e9 manages to survive, although far from its past magnificence. Then a military coup overthrows Per\u00f3n, and the casino is closed. It is a hard blow for Ferrari, who commits suicide. In his will, he states that the caf\u00e9 will remain the property of his employees, provided that they never shut it down or put it up for sale.\n\nIn the following weeks, they try to do their best to make ends meet, but after a while, some of them give up and desert the place. In a few months, the only ones who remain are Rick, Ilsa, Sam, Renault, and Ugarte. To make a living they decide to perform isolated scenes, which are shown to the few tourists who happen to go by.\n\nTime passes, and not only the place deteriorates but the health of its dwellers as well. The moment the narrator arrives, Sam can offer nothing but an account of what happened in that fantastic Casablanca, and introduce Rick and Ilsa, who are much older now (Rick is blind; Ilsa makes a brief appearance, dressed as Ingrid Bergman in one of the scenes of the movie). In a vase placed near the exit door, visitors leave a few coins.\n\nMeanwhile, the storm has subsided.  Sam plays \"As Time Goes By\" once again, to say goodbye now. The narrator gets into his car and, with the feeling that he has witnessed a sequel to the movie that Hollywood never made, leaves the place.\n\nBackground\nIn 2002 Edgar Brau was invited by the University of Nevada, Reno, as visiting professor and writer-in-residence for the fall 2002 \u2013 spring 2003. As writer-in-residence he had to write a work of fiction during his stay. He had been considering the possibility of writing a fantastic narration (in the line of his The Poem or The Buddha's Eyes) that would be a tribute to his father's movie-theater, where he had spent his childhood years. As he said:\n\n\u201cI started Casablanca with the idea of writing a fantastic story that would pay tribute to my father's cinema, where I spent my early years. I wanted that cinema, the building itself, to be very much present in the work. But I soon realized that the narration was leading somewhere else, and as one must never go against the way a story unfolds, I decided to put off that homage for another occasion. Later on I will do it, and with a fantastic story, as I said\u201d.\n\nSo, the novella developed a realistic tone and it had little to do with that cinema of his childhood. It was written in November\u2013December 2002, in Reno, and corrected in February 2003 at Lake Tahoe.\n\nMain characters\nSe\u00f1or Ferrari A rich Argentine ranch owner, who offers all his possessions to his admired Ingrid Bergman as long as she marries him. His proposal is rejected, so he decides to create his own Casablanca on his estate, and to play the role of Se\u00f1or Ferrari.\n\nSam He is from Uruguay. He was working as a bellhop at a hotel in the City of Buenos Aires when Se\u00f1or Ferrari came across him. He's the true narrator in the novella.\n\nRick Argentinean, a former high school literature teacher. He's very fond of French authors and given to drinking. When the novella starts he is over eighty years old and blind.\n\nIlsa Australian. She earned her living as a trapeze artist at an American circus. On a Brazil tour she was hired by one of Se\u00f1or Ferrari's agents to work as Ingrid Bergman's double. Foul mouthed and energetic, she becomes Ferrari's mistress and prot\u00e9g\u00e9e. In the story, Sam calls her \u201cElsa\u201d.\n\nUgarte Before being hired by Se\u00f1or Ferrari, he sang tangos at a strip-tease night club in the City of Buenos Aires.\n\nFortunato A homeless child adopted by Ilsa and Sam when he was a few months old. In the story he is around ten. Although he does not know the language, he reads French books to Rick.\n\nThe Narrator Nothing is said about his age, physical appearance or profession.\n\nTheme\n\nThe novella Casablanca is a perfect metaphor of Argentina. In the story, the Argentine Casablanca is a copy of the famous movie; in real life, Argentina was built as a copy of certain European countries, a copy, so to say, that \u201cEuropeans in exile\u201d (as Borges defined himself and Argentines) made of a movie entitled \u201cEurope\u201d.\n\nThe splendor of the Argentine Casablanca was weakened, at first, by certain natural disasters, and later on by catastrophical political events; the splendor of Argentina, was eroded mainly by those unfortunate political events. Among them (and as a parallel between real life and fiction which Brau's work reflects perfectly), are the military coups that shook the nation in the period 1930-1980.\n\nIn the novella, the coup d\u00b4\u00e9tat which overthrew President Per\u00f3n in 1955 was the beginning of the end for Ferrari's fabulous work, for his Casablanca \u2014which had already been \u201churt\u201d by the flood and the hoof-and-mouth disease\u2014. In real life, the beginning of the end for that other \u201cCasablanca\u201d, Argentina, took place some years earlier, in 1930 (when Jos\u00e9 F\u00e9lix Uriburu led a military coup against President Hip\u00f3lito Yrigoyen), and the signs of decadence were revealed more slowly.\n\nThe novella has an open ending. The same thing sometimes happens in real life.\n\nTranslation into English\nThe translation of Casablanca by Andrea G. Labinger was finalist in 2007 Pen USA Literary Award in the category of Translation.\n\nSee also\n History of Argentina\n\nReferences\n\n The Washington Post: \u201cFor the first time in English, the Argentine labyrinths of Edgar Brau\u201d, by Michael Dirda.

The novella tells the story of Rick Blaine, an American expatriate living in Casablanca during the early days of WWII. The story explores themes of love, sacrifice, and political resistance against Nazi occupation. Casablanca was initially written as an unproduced play called Everybody Comes to Rick's. Burnett and his writing partner, Joan Alison, adapted the play into a novella that was published in the New Yorker in 1941, a few months before the release of the famous movie adaptation. The novella follows Rick\u2019s struggles to reconcile his past with his current life in Casablanca. He runs a nightclub called Rick's Caf\u00e9 Am\u00e9ricain, which attracts a diverse group of customers, including refugees, Nazis, and French and Belgian resistance fighters. The plot thickens when Ilsa Lund, Rick's former lover, returns to Casablanca with her husband, a key resistance leader, and Rick is forced to choose between his love for Ilsa and the greater cause of defeating the Nazis. The novella received critical acclaim for its vivid portrayal of wartime Casablanca and its complex characters. Burnett's writing style is praised for its wit and vivid imagery, making it a compelling read. The novella's timeless themes and unforgettable characters have made it a staple of American literature. Casablanca the movie, directed by Michael Curtiz, starred Humphrey Bogart as Rick and Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa. The movie went on to win three Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and cemented Casablanca's place as an iconic American classic. In summary, Casablanca is a novella that explores the complexities of wartime love and political resistance. With its compelling storyline and unforgettable characters, it is a timeless classic that has captivated readers and viewers for over 70 years.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 29485442}

Hamilton attended the local Alexandra College in Hamilton. On 7 November 1888 at St Mary's Anglican Church in Caulfield, she married 33-year-old sheepmaster David Alexander Skene.\n\nCareer\nStraddled in debt, Hamilton's husband had to seek employment in New South Wales, while she and her children remained in Hamilton. In 1900 the family moved to Manly, Sydney, where they ran a modest dairy farm. In 1906, they moved to Melbourne and her husband began selling wool. The family purchased a property in South Yarra in 1910.\n\nUnable to make the second payment on the property he was buying when the banks collapsed in the early 1890s, David was forced to work as a station-manager in New South Wales. Lillias and their children stayed at Hamilton. They rejoined him at Curraweena station, near Bourke, in 1896 before moving to Glenariff and then in 1900 to Manly, Sydney. There they invested in a small dairy and leased 25 acres (10 ha). In the face of drought and the high cost of fodder, they sold out in 1906 and moved to Melbourne, where David set up as a woolbroker and stock-and-station agent. In 1910, with money inherited from her mother, Lillias acquired a house for the family at South Yarra.\n\nSkene was the assistant-secretary of the National Council of Women of Victoria (Victorian NCW).

She was on her maiden voyage from London, headed ultimately for Wilmington, North Carolina, carrying cargo from the United Kingdom to help the Confederates.  The United Kingdom could not be seen to be directly aiding the Confederates, hence various levels of secrecy were used for this and similar vessels.  For example, at the time she was using an assumed name of Nola, a ruse to help avoid the attention of Union forces. She had used at least two other names at various times, namely Gloria and Paramount.\n\nCaptain Pittman was in command of the vessel, and saw her safely across a rough Atlantic Ocean as far as Bermuda, where he planned to stop to take on coal before departing for Wilmington.  The ship hit the reef of Bermuda's north shore, in an area known as the Western Blue Cut, on 30 December 1863.\n\nOnce the vessel was known to be in distress, a boat from St Georges went to the scene, and while much of the cargo and the entire crew were saved, Montana was lost, mostly due to a large gash in her side of over 10 feet (3 meters).\n\nVessel statistics\nThe vessel was 236 feet (71.9 meters) long, with a 25-foot (7.6-meter) beam, and a displacement of 750 tons.\n\nCurrent status\nThe wreck is quite compact within the Bermudian reef system to the north west of the island, and it lies in relatively shallow water, at a maximum depth of about thirty feet.  The wreck has various parts still intact, however it is easy to confuse with another wreck, that of the Constellation, which sank in the same location in 1942.\n\nIt is a popular dive spot for many of the local dive operators, as it lies within a 45 minute boat journey of Hamilton, and in such shallow waters it can be appreciated by both snorkelling, and scuba diving.\n\nThe wreck sustained extensive damage during Hurricane Humberto in September 2019.\n\nGPS co-ordinates\nMontana is located at 32\u00b021.817\u2032N, 64\u00b054.812\u2032W.\n\nReferences\nNotes\n\nBibliography\n Bermuda Dive Sites (no ISBN) produced by The Bermuda Zoological Society and The Department of Conservations Services.\n Bermuda Shipwrecks Daniel and Denise Berg, published by Aqua-Explorers Inc , 199 1 (LCCC 90-084836)\n https://web.archive.org/web/20061105084321/http://www.bermudascuba.com/divesites.asp\n https://web.archive.org/web/20120419110200/http://www.divebermuda.com/guides/wreck/default.aspx\n\nMontana\nShipwrecks of the American Civil War\nMaritime incidents in December 1863", "machine_text": "Montana was a historic British oil tanker built in 1929. The ship was originally named Dunsley and was built by the British Admiralty in response to the growing need for the transport of petroleum products around the world. In 1935, the ship was purchased by the Anglo-Saxon Oil Company, which renamed her Montana and refitted her for her new role as an oil tanker. Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, Montana was an important ship in the Anglo-Saxon Oil Company's fleet. During World War II, the ship was used to transport vital supplies and fuel to the Allied forces in North Africa and the Middle East. She played a key role in many critical convoys, including one to Murmansk, Russia, where she delivered fuel to the Soviet Union. After the war, Montana continued to transport oil around the world. In 1958, the ship was involved in a collision with another tanker, which damaged her hull and caused her to leak oil into the English Channel. Despite efforts to save the ship, Montana ultimately sank, spilling more than 4,000 tonnes of oil into the sea. The sinking of Montana caused widespread environmental damage, and the incident spurred the British government to introduce stricter regulations for oil tankers. Today, the wreck of Montana remains on the seabed of the English Channel, and is considered a hazardous location due to the oil still present in the vessel. Montana's legacy is one of both triumph and tragedy. The ship played a critical role in the Allied war effort, but ultimately met a tragic end that had far-reaching consequences. Despite its tragic end, however, Montana remains an important part of maritime history, and serves as a reminder of the importance of responsible navigation and environmental stewardship.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 7343364}

Merrill first entered the broadcasting field in 1922 when he joined the staff of KSL in Salt Lake City. He quickly became a prominent voice on the station, broadcasting on a variety of topics ranging from news to sports. In 1925, Merrill began a series of educational programs on KSL, which were later syndicated nationally. These programs were innovative in their use of radio as an educational tool, and they served as a model for many other educational broadcasters. Merrill's programs covered a wide range of topics, including history, science, and politics, and they were geared towards both children and adults. In 1933, Merrill was appointed head of the newly created educational broadcasting division of the National Broadcasting Company (NBC). In this capacity, he oversaw the creation of many educational programs, including the highly successful \"Human Adventure\" series. Merrill's work at NBC helped to establish educational broadcasting as a vital component of the American broadcasting industry. Merrill retired from NBC in 1957 but continued to be active in the broadcasting industry. He served as a consultant to many educational broadcasters and was a frequent speaker at conferences and seminars. In recognition of his contributions to the field of educational broadcasting, Merrill was inducted into the Broadcasting Hall of Fame in 1984. Prex Merrill's influence can still be seen in the educational programming that is produced today. His dedication to the use of radio as a tool for education helped to pave the way for the development of other media, such as television and the internet, as educational tools.

She was the wife of 34th President of Brazil, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, and First Lady of her country between January 1, 1995 to December 31, 2002. She too was a Ph.D in anthropology from the University of S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\nAs professor and researcher Cardoso taught at the Latin American College of Social Sciences (Flacso/Unesco), University of Chile (Santiago), Maison des Sciences de L'Homme (Paris), University of California, Berkeley, and Columbia University (New York City). She was an associate member of the Center for Latin American Studies of the University of Cambridge. With her husband, the sociologist and former president of Brazil, Fernando Henrique Cardoso,  she founded and later directed the research institute Cebrap (Centro Brasileiro de An\u00e1lise e Planejamento \u2013 Brazilian Center of Analysis and Planning), which continues to be a leading site of social science research in Brazil.\n\nDr. Cardoso\u2019s academic reputation rests primarily on a series of highly influential articles and book chapters on popular movements and political participation that she published in the 1980s and 1990s. Under Dr. Cardoso, Cebrap created Brazil\u2019s first research group on social movements, helping to legitimate formal academic study of the \"new\" (non-class) social movements that had emerged in the 1970s. At the same time, she was careful to stress the limits of identity-based and popular movements for political transformation, noting the divisions among them and their frequent dependency on clientelistic relations with the state and political parties.\n\nUnlike many academics, Dr. Cardoso also had the opportunity to put some of her theories into practice after her husband was elected president. She transformed the traditional charity approach of other first ladies with her Comunidade Solid\u00e1ria (Solidary Community) programs that stressed the role of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in state-society partnerships. In addition to executing concrete social programs, Comunidade Solid\u00e1ria also facilitated broad discussions of important social topics, from agrarian reform to the legal status of NGOs, publishing the results of these dialogues. Anthony Hall of the London School of Economics told the BBC after her death that she was instrumental in developing the plan to bundle various social programs together in the way that has become characteristic of the successful Bolsa Familia social program.  She published a book about these experiences,  Comunidade Solidaria: Fortalecendo a Sociedade, Promovendo O Desenvolvimento (Comunitas, 2002). She transformed the Comunidade Solidaria into an NGO, Comunitas, after her husband left office.\n\nShe died in S\u00e3o Paulo on June 24, 2008, after suffering a cardiac arrest.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Frank Staff\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Frank Staff (15 June 1918 \u2013 10 May 1971) was a South African ballet dancer, choreographer, producer, and company director. He was a major figure in the history of European theatrical dance in South Africa.\n\nEarly life\nFrank Cedric Staff was born to an Irish mother and an English father in the diamond mining town of Kimberley, in what is now the Northern Cape Province of South Africa. As a teenager, he moved to Cape Town, where he attended Diocesan College and received his early dance training from Helen Webb and Maude Lloyd, who had studied with Marie Rambert in London. After Lloyd returned to England in 1933, she encouraged her young pupil to join her. At age fifteen, Staff moved to London to continue his training at Rambert's school in Bedford Gardens.\n\nCareer\nStaff was soon invited to join Rambert's Ballet Club, as her performing group was then called. For the next twelve years, from 1933 to 1945, he worked with the Rambert company as both a dancer and choreographer. Except for two seasons with the Vic-Wells Ballet, 1934/35 and 1938/39, and a brief stint with Walter Gore's London Ballet in 1940, he was a featured performer and choreographer with Ballet Rambert.\n\nDancer\nStaff inherited many of Hugh Laing's roles in the Rambert repertory, including The Lover in Jardin aux Lilas and Mercury in The Planets, both works by Antony Tudor. He also danced in several ballets by Frederick Ashton, among them Recamier, Fa\u00e7ade, and Mephisto Valse. For the Vic-Wells company, he appeared as Horn Blower in The Rake's Progress by Ninette de Valois and created the role of Cupid in Ashton's Cupid and Psyche (1939). For the London Ballet, he created the role of The Boy, Julien, in La F\u00eate \u0116trange (1940), set to music of Gabriel Faur\u00e9 by Andr\u00e9e Howard. Other roles in his varied repertory included The Poet in Les Sylphides, the Spectre in Le Spectre de la Rose, and Harlequin in Le Carnaval, all choreographed by Michel Fokine. He also danced such different roles as Bluebird in The Sleeping Beauty, by Petipa; the Faun in Afternoon of a Faun, by Nijinsky; and Death in Death and the Maiden, by Howard.\n\nChoreographer\nStaff's first choreographic work, The Tartans, was a new version of Ashton's ballet of the same name. A pas de trois for himself, his wife Elisabeth Schooling, and Walter Gore, set to music by William Boyce, it was made for Ballet Rambert in 1938. Over the next two years, he contributed three of his best works to the company's repertory: Czernyana (1939), to the piano exercises of Carl Czerny; Enigma Variations (1939), to the score by Edward Elgar; and Peter and the Wolf (1940), to the music and text of Sergei Prokofiev. All these works displayed his facility for witty invention that would characterize many of his later ballets. He also created Czerny 2 (1941), a second version of his popular hit, a series of dances caricaturing different kinds of ballet. Combined with its predecessor under the title Czernyana, it remained in the Rambert repertory for many years. During the war years in England\u2014September 1939 to May 1945\u2014Staff served as a captain in the Argyle and Sutherland Highlanders but was released temporarily to choreograph Peter and the Wolf and Czerny 2.\n\nUpon completion of his military service, Staff returned to his homeland in 1946 and joined the South African National Ballet in Cape Town. There he danced in his own ballets and produced works in which he had appeared in England, notably Nijinsky's L'Apr\u00e8s-midi d'un Faune and Howard's Death and the Maiden. Returning to Britain in 1947, Staff spent the next few years as an international freelance. He served as resident choreographer of the Metropolitan Ballet (1947\u20131948), toured Australia with Ballet Rambert (1948), toured the United States and Canada with Sadler's Wells Ballet (1949), and was subsequently appointed ballet master and choreographer at the Empire Theatre (1950) on London's Leicester Square. In 1953, he went back to South Africa and in 1955 founded his own company, the South African Ballet, for which he choreographed or produced more than fifteen works, including Don Juan (1955), with music by Rachmaninoff; Transfigured Night (1957), to music by Schoenberg; and The Swan of Tuonela (1958), to music by Sibelius.\n\nIn 1963, the South African government established four professional ballet companies, one in each of the four provinces, and Staff would eventually work with them all: the companies of the Cape Performing Arts Board (CAPAB Ballet), the Natal Performing Arts Council (NAPAC Ballet), the Performing Arts Council of the Transvaal (PACT Ballet), and the Performing Arts Council of the Orange Free State (PACOFS Ballet). For CAPAB Ballet, based in Cape Town, he mounted Romeo and Juliet (1964), to the Prokofiev score, and for NAPAC Ballet, in Durban, he set Apollo 65 (1965), to music by Benjamin Britten. Moving on to the Transvaal in 1966, he worked in Johannesburg until 1968 as resident producer and choreographer with PACT Ballet under the direction of Faith de Villiers. These years were especially productive. Beside staging his popular Peter and the Wolf, he created seven new ballets. Among them were Spanish Encounter (1966), set to the classical guitar music of Joaquin Rodrigo; Five Faces of Euridyce (1966), set to music by Stephen O'Reilly and described as a \"good-humoured ballet in five visions\"; Czernyana III, the third rescension of his first big hit; and Raka (1967), a three-act ballet set to a score by Graham Newcater and based on an epic poem in Afrikaans by N.P. van Wyk Louw. Raka proved such a success that it was soon made into a film that was distributed worldwide by Twentieth Century Fox.\n\nThereafter, Staff was artistic director of PACOFS Ballet in Bloemfontein from 1969 until his death in 1971. Among the six ballets he created for this company were two notable works made in 1970: Mantis Moon, based on a Bushman legend and set to music by Hans Maske, and S\u00e9ance, derived from Menotti's opera The Medium but set to music by Britten. Staff's unfinished work, The Rain Queen (1971), set to a commissioned score by Newcater, was planned as the first full-length ballet with an indigenous South African theme. The title character, known as the Rain Queen, was Modjadji, the hereditary queen of the Lobedu people (ba Lobedu) of the Limpopo Province. In homage to Staff, the work was rechoreographed by David Poole and mounted for CAPAB Ballet in cooperation with PACOFS.\n\nPersonal life\nStaff married four times. He wed his fellow Ballet Rambert dancer Elisabeth Schooling in 1942, and she danced in many of his early works. He next married English dancer Jaqueline St. Clere, followed by South African musical comedy actress Heather Lloyd-Jones. All three of these marriages ended in divorce. Staff's fourth wife was South African dancer Veronica Paeper, who became a prolific choreographer in her own right as director of CAPAB Ballet, later known as Cape Town City Ballet. Each of Staff's four wives bore him a son.\n\nReferences\n\n1918 births\n1971 deaths\nSouth African choreographers\nSouth African male ballet dancers\nBallet choreographers\nRambert Dance Company dancers", "machine_text": "Frank Staff was a British artist, born on the 29th of July, 1918 in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, England.

Staff began his formal art education at the Hastings School of Art before being accepted to the prestigious Royal College of Art, London, in 1938, where he studied painting under well-known artists such as Henry Moore and Eric Ravilious. During his time at the RCA, Staff started experimenting with set design and sculpture, gaining a reputation as a versatile and talented artist. After serving in the Royal Navy during World War II, he worked as an art director for various advertising agencies before returning to his painting and sculpture in the early 1950s. Staff's early painting works were heavily influenced by the neo-romantic movement, but he soon shifted towards abstract expressionism, with works featuring bold, gestural brushstrokes and intense colours. His sculptures were similarly abstract and often monumental in scale, featuring curious forms that seemed to defy gravity. Throughout his career, Staff exhibited his works in major galleries and museums throughout the UK and abroad, including the Royal Academy of Arts and the Tate Gallery in London. He also received numerous awards and honours for his contributions to the arts, including being made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts in 1975.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Subcountability\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "In constructive mathematics, a collection  is subcountable if there exists a partial surjection from the natural numbers onto it. \nThis may be expressed as\n\nwhere  is the set of natural numbers ( with disregard for arithmetic) and where  denotes that  is a surjective function from  onto .\nIn other words, all elements of a subcountable collection  are functionally in the image of an indexing set of counting numbers  and thus the set  can be understood as being dominated by the countable set .\n\nDiscussion\n\nExample \nAn important case is where  denotes some subclass of a bigger class of functions as studied in computability theory. \n\nConsider the total computable functions and note that being total is not a decidable property, i.e. there cannot be a constructive bijection between the total functions and the natural numbers. However, via enumeration of the codes of all possible partial computable functions (which also allows non-terminating programs), subsets of those, such as the total functions, are seen to be subcountable sets. Note that by Rice's theorem on index sets, most domains  are not recursive. Indeed, no effective map between all counting numbers  and the infinite (non-finite) indexing set  is asserted here, merely the subset relation . Being dominated by a constructively non-countable set of numbers , the name subcountable thus conveys that the uncountable set  is no bigger than .\n\nThe demonstration that  is subcountable also implies that it is classically (non-constructively) formally countable, but this does not reflect any effective countability. In other words, the fact that an algorithm listing all total functions in sequence cannot be coded up is not captured by classical axioms regarding set and function existence. We see that, depending on the axioms of a theory, subcountability may be more likely to be provable than countability.\n\nRelation to Excluded Middle \nIn constructive logics and set theories, which tie the existence of a function between infinite (non-finite) sets to questions of effectivity and decidability, the subcountability property splits from countability and is thus not a redundant notion. \nThe indexing set  of natural numbers may be posited to exist, e.g. as a subset via set theoretical axioms like the separation axiom schema, so that \n. \nBut this set may then still fail to be detachable, in the sense that\n\ncannot be proven without assuming it as an axiom.\nOne may fail to effectively count  if one fails to map the counting numbers  into the indexing set , for this reason.\n\nIn classical mathematics \nAsserting all laws of classical logic, the disjunctive property of  discussed above indeed does hold for all sets. Then, for nonempty , the properties numerable ( injects into ), countable ( has  as its range), subcountable (a subset of  surjects into ) and also not -productive (a countability property essentially defined in terms of subsets of , formalized below) are all equivalent and express that a set is finite or countably infinite.\n\nNon-classical assertions \nNot asserting the law of excluded middle \n for all proposition , \nit can then also be consistent to assert the subcountability of sets that classically (i.e. non-constructively) exceed the cardinality of the natural numbers.\nNote that in a constructive setting, a countability claim about the function space  out of the full set , as in , may be disproven. But subcountability  of an uncountable set  by a set  that is not effectively detachable from  may be permitted.\n\nAs  is uncountable and classically in turn provably not subcountable, the classical framework with its large function space is incompatible with the constructive Church's thesis, an axiom of Russian constructivism.\n\nSet theories\n\nCantorian arguments on subsets of the naturals \nAs reference theory we look at the constructive set theory , which has Replacement, Bounded Separation, strong Infinity, is agnostic towards the existence of power sets, but includes the axiom that asserts that any function space  is set, given  are also sets. \nIn this theory, it is moreover consistent to assert that every set is subcountable. \n\nThe compatibility of various axioms is discussed in this section by means of possible surjections on an infinite set of counting numbers .\n\nThe situations discussed below\u2014onto function spaces versus onto power classes\u2014are different insofar as for functions , by definition there exists a unique return value for every value  in the domain, .

Nevertheless, also in the case of , the existence of a full surjection , with domain , is indeed contradictory, since membership of  is decidable.\n\nBeyond these observations, also note that for any non-zero number , the functions  in  involving the surjection  cannot be extended to all of  by a similar contradiction argument.

But the argument that the cardinality of that set would thus in some sense exceed that of the natural numbers relies on a restriction to just the classical size conception and its induced ordering of sets by cardinality.\nMotivated by the above sections, the infinite set  may be considered \"smaller\" than the class . Subcountability as judgement of small size shall not be conflated with the standard mathematical definition of cardinality relations as defined by Cantor, with smaller cardinality being defined in terms of injections out of  and equality of cardinalities being defined in terms of bijections. \nMoreover, note that constructively, an ordering \"\" like that of cardinalities can be undecidable.\n\nModels \nThe above analysis affects formal properties of codings of .

The resulting theory is in contradiction to the Axiom of power set and with the law of excluded middle.\n More stronger yet, some models of Kripke\u2013Platek set theory validate that all sets are even countable.\n\nSubcountable implies not -productive \nAny countable set is subcountable and any subcountable set is not -productive:\nA set  is said to be -productive if, whenever any of its subsets is the range of some partial function  on , there always remains at least one element that lies outside that range. This may be expressed as\n\nA set being -productive speaks for how hard it is to generate its elements: They cannot be generated using a single function. As such, -productive sets escape subcountability.\nDiagonal arguments often involve this notion, be it explicitly or implicitly.\n\nSee also\n Cantor's diagonal argument\n Computable function\n Constructive set theory\n Schr\u00f6der\u2013Bernstein theorem\n Subquotient\n Total order\n\nReferences \n\nConstructivism (mathematics)", "machine_text": "Subcountability refers to a mathematical concept that deals with the size of sets. In particular, subcountability is a measure of how many elements a subset of a set has. It is a weaker form of countability, which measures the size of a set itself. Subcountability is a useful concept for understanding certain aspects of set theory and topology, as well as for analyzing the complexity of algorithms and data structures. A set is considered subcountable if it has at most the same number of elements as some countable set. For example, the set of natural numbers is countable, and so any subset of the natural numbers (such as the set of even numbers) is subcountable. Another way to think of subcountability is that a set is subcountable if it can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with a countable set. For example, the integers are countable, and so any subset of the integers can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the integers, and is therefore subcountable. One important application of subcountability is in the study of infinite-dimensional vector spaces. In this context, a set is called a Schauder basis if every element of the vector space can be written as a linear combination of countably many elements from the set. Schauder bases are important for understanding various aspects of functional analysis, and subcountability plays a crucial role in their definition and properties. Another application of subcountability is in the analysis of algorithms and data structures. In particular, subcountability is used to analyze the efficiency of algorithms and data structures on sets of varying sizes. Algorithms that are subcountable are often more efficient than those that are not, since they can take advantage of the structure and properties of subcountable sets to achieve faster running times and use less memory. Overall, subcountability is an important concept in mathematics and computer science, with applications in diverse areas such as set theory, topology, functional analysis, and algorithm analysis. Its properties and applications are still actively studied and researched by mathematicians and computer scientists today.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 15036487}

Carr Bowers McClenny married into the Darby family, and then bought most of this land in the late 19th century. He intended to harvest it for timber.\n\nDarbyville became known as McClenny. McLenny developed many businesses there related to lumber: harvesting the wood, sawmills to process it, turpentine, and land. The town name McClenny was changed to the current name of The City of  Macclenny because the post office department had a rule against using capital letters in the middle of a name. The first post office in Macclenny was established in 1890.\n\nThere were settlers in Macclenny as early as 1829, but it was not until after the Civil War that more people began to settle there.

The film is about the social injustice and exploitation faced by migrant labourers in Goa, and is set in the 1990s. It was co-produced by people from India, France and Netherlands (Thin Air, Three Rivers, Kepler Films, Cine-Sud Promotion) under the banner of Goa Film Bazaar, with some of the editing done in Paris.\n\nThe film premiered at the Hong Kong International Film Festival in April 2017, and was also chosen for the Karlovy Vary Film Festival. It became the first Konkani film to be commercially released in France. Juze also became the first Konkani film to be selected for mentoring and promotion during Film Bazaar, the filmmaking lab organised by National Film Development Corporation (NFDC) in Goa, in 2015. It was featured at the Mumbai Film Festival in October 2017, at the 48th International Film Festival of India (IFFI) in the Indian Panorama section in November 2017, the Minsk Film Festival in Belarus (where it won an award) and the Dublin International Film Festival in Ireland. The film was finally released in Goa, with an \"A\" certification by the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), in April 2018.\n\nPlot \nThe story is set in the 1990s. Santosh (Rushikesh Naik) is a teenage boy studying in Class X. He lives in a slum in Borimol village with his grandmother, referred to as Tai (played by Prashanti Talpankar; Tai translates to \"aunt\"). It is revealed that Tai's son, Santosh's father, had killed Santosh's mother and had been arrested, leaving Tai and Santosh to fend for themselves. Thus, despite being native Goans, they are forced to live with other migrants from poorer parts of the country and work for Juze (Sudesh Bhise). With his business of manufacturing cashew feni and his political connections (which consist of the local politician), Juze terrorizes the whole village, even going so far as to physically abuse and rape the women.\n\nSantosh is an intelligent boy and scores well in class. He frequently skips work to go to school. This frequently gets him in trouble with Juze, who often beats him up publicly. Juze's wife Maria (Gauri Kamat) recognizes Santosh's intelligence and demands that he help her son, who is weak in studies. She also forces him to perform sexual favours for her. Meanwhile, Santosh has a budding romance with his classmate, Maya (Barkha Naik). However, their relationship slowly breaks apart when she realizes the helplessness of his situation. All of this ultimately leads to Santosh confronting Juze with a friend and beating him to death. Santosh then runs away from the village, and is seen waiting tables at a beachside shack.\n\nCast \n Rushikesh Naik as Santosh\n Prashanti Talpankar as Tai, Santosh's grandmother\n Sudesh Bhise as Juze\n Gauri Kamat as Maria, Juze's wife\n Barkha Naik as Maya\n\nProduction\n\nThe film is partially based on writer-director Miransha Naik's childhood experiences. The film is set in the 90s, making the character Santosh the same age as Miransha was then. The film is also set in Naik's hometown of Borimol village. He admits that some of the events and characters have been adapted from real life. He named the movie after the villain as he found it unique. He believes that the events revolve around Juze, and even though the movie is about Santosh\u2019s journey, it simultaneously portrays the downfall of Juze.\n\nIt may be noted that Naik lost both his parents to illness at the age of 9. He grew up in Borimol along with his grandmother and two sisters, coming third in his Class X exams. He dropped out within a year of joining the BCom course at Government College, Quepem, to contribute to his household by working as a waiter. His grandmother passed away when he was 19, and he had to take responsibility of the marriages of his two sisters. By waiting tables for nearly five years, he made enough money to set up his own beachside shack, named Blue Corner, on Benaulim Beach. Two scenes in Juze show the village children watching Subhash Ghai\u2019s Karz and Hero, which is reminiscent of Naik and his young friends and his love for movies.\n\nInitially, Naik chose a Mumbai-based actor for the role of Juze's wife, Maria, as he wasn't confident that local artistes would be up to a role with a number of sex scenes. However, the chosen actor couldn't perform because of her language barrier. Naik then turned to Gauri Kamat upon many recommendations, and after some initial hesitation, she agreed to play the part. However, by late 2015, they faced an even bigger problem: shortage of funds even before post-production. It was then that Naik thought of National Film Development Corporation\u2019s annual \"Film Bazaar\", where it attracted the attention of noted producer Olivia Stewart, who procured funds from the Netherlands-based production company Keplerfilm and the France-based production company of Cine-Sud Promotions. Christian Jeune, who is famous as a scout for Cannes Film Festival, was also impressed with the film's idea, and the film almost made it to Cannes\u2019 Un Certain Regard selection.\n\nThe film shows all the interesting developments (including that of his relationship with Maria and Maya) through clever and subtle camerawork, including a series of tracking shots, portraying how Santosh nonchalantly sees all this as a part of his daily life.\n\nReception\n\nCritical response\nThe film was well received by critics for portraying the lesser-known culture and exploitation of the poorer classes taking place in Goa (which is otherwise portrayed very glamorously in films).\n\nClarence Tsui of The Hollywood Reporter called the film a \"contemplative and topical debut, with a story offering mostly heartbreak but also a faint glimpse of hope.\" Nikki Baughan of ScreenDaily wrote, \"Juze may be an exploration of an existence which is endured, rather than lived, but there\u2019s no trace of melodrama or didacticism.\"\n\nNotably, Juze was screened at the Hong Kong International Film Festival, the Karlovy Vary Film Festival, the Mumbai Film Festival, the International Film Festival of India, the Minsk Film Festival and the Dublin International Film Festival.\n\nAwards\n Special Jury Award at Minsk Film Festival, 2017 (director, Miransha Naik)\n\nSee also\n Konkani cinema\n Paltadacho Munis\n Nachom-ia Kumpasar\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \n \n \n\n2017 films\nKonkani-language films\nIndian films\nFilms set in Goa\nFilms shot in Goa\n2010s Konkani-language films", "machine_text": "Juze is a mobile app that allows users to create and share augmented reality experiences.

It is located on chromosome 22 and encodes for a protein known as menin that functions as a transcriptional regulator. Structure The MN1 gene is made up of 22 exons and spans over 96 kilobases of DNA. Its protein product, menin, is a 610 amino acid protein that contains two nuclear localization signals, a DNA-binding domain, and numerous protein-protein interaction domains. Function The MN1 gene is widely expressed during embryonic development and is essential for proper development of the central nervous system, hematopoiesis, and formation of the pancreas. In adults, the gene is found in a broad range of tissues and is involved in numerous cellular processes. It functions as a transcriptional regulator, controlling the expression of a wide variety of genes involved in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and DNA repair. Role in Cancer Mutations in the MN1 gene have been reported in several types of cancer, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, and gliomas. The mutations have been shown to confer a proliferative advantage to cancer cells by deregulating cell cycle progression and promoting tumor cell survival. In addition, the menin protein has been found to interact with other cancer-associated genes, such as the oncogene MLL, and may play a role in the development of several types of cancer. Clinical significance Several studies have suggested that abnormal MN1 expression or mutations in the gene may serve as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis or act as therapeutic targets in cancer treatment. For example, small molecule inhibitors of the menin protein are being investigated as potential cancer therapeutics.

The Batillaria snail has a conical shell that is divided into several chambers, making it a univalve structure. The overall color of the shell varies from species to species, but they are generally brown or gray with striped or mottled patterns. The shell can reach up to five centimeters in length, though some species can grow to be much larger. This genus contains around 40 species, with the most common being Batillaria zonalis, which is found throughout Southeast Asia. They inhabit shallow waters close to the shore and are often seen climbing on rocks and mangrove roots during low tide.

British horror drew its influence from gothic literature of the nineteenth century. Influential works during the nineteenth century include Mary Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus (1823), and the gothic horror novel, Dracula (1897), written by Bram Stoker.\n\nThe rise of British silent horror cinema coincided with World War I. The War and the associated prevalence of violence and death had a profound impact on films produced in the subsequent years and decades. As time went on, spiritualism continued to be a prominent thematic focus, largely due to the British public's mourning of their deceased. British silent horror films began to be a depiction of the public's efforts to maintain a spiritual connection with the deceased. Specifically, filmmakers drawing inspiration from Christianity, utilizing religious uncertainties and the surrounding perceptions of the after-life to create dramatic effect.\n\nExamples of British silent horror films\n\nShort silent films had become an increasingly common cinematic form of entertainment during the time of the surge in popularity of gothic horror filmmaking. Such films include Dr. Trimball\u2019s Verdict (1913), directed by Frank Wilson, and The Basilisk (1914), directed by Cecil Hepworth. It is could be suggested that these films drew a focus upon establishing narrative themes of the soul and religious spiritualism that defined early British silent horror films. Later, Will Barker directed the film, The Beetle (1919), that was based on Richard Marsh\u2019s novel, Beetle. Barker's film tells the story of an Egyptian princess whose soul is transformed into a monster and is able to possess the commoners.\n\nAs the British horror genre expanded, American horror cinema began to draw influence from the wave of British spiritualistic horror films. In 1913, American director, George Loane Tucker, travelled to Britain to produce the film, The Man Without a Soul (1916).  The film was inspired by Mary Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus.

These films were characterized by their eerie atmospheres, supernatural themes, and use of cinematic techniques like shadows and lighting to create suspense and fear. Some of the earliest British silent horror films were adaptations of popular horror literature, such as James Whale's Frankenstein (1910) and Dracula (1913) directed by Maurice Elvey. These films marked the beginning of a new era of horror storytelling in Britain aimed at thrilling audiences and scaring them out of their wits. Other notable British silent horror films include The Man Who Laughs (1928) directed by Paul Leni, which is based on Victor Hugo's novel by the same name, and The Phantom of the Opera (1925) directed by Rupert Julian. Another notable British horror filmmaker of the silent era was Alfred Hitchcock, whose early films like The Lodger (1927) and The Ring (1927) were highly influenced by the horror genre. Hitchcock used his signature techniques of suspense and surprise to create a sense of dread in his audience, setting the bar for what would later become a staple of the horror genre. As silent cinema grew in popularity and evolved with advancements in technology, the British film industry produced more and more horror movies. However, with the advent of sound in the late 1920s, the British horror genre shifted in a new direction, relying less on visual storytelling and more on dialogue and sound effects. Despite this shift, the influence of British silent horror remains evident in modern horror films, with filmmakers still using techniques pioneered during this time to create suspense and fear in today's audiences.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 59195948}

It is the second book of a trilogy beginning with Vale of the Vole and ending with Man from Mundania.\n\nPlot introduction\nThe protagonist of Heaven Cent is Prince Dolph, shapeshifting son of King Dor and Queen Irene and younger brother of Princess Ivy.  The story begins with Dolph, a pre-teen, setting out on a Quest with his designated Adult Companion Marrow Bones to locate the magician Humfrey, who had been missing since Vale of the Vole.\n\nPlot summary\n\nThe story begins with Prince Dolph lying in his sister, Ivy's, bed watching her magical tapestry which shows images from the past and present of Xanth. Dolph is the son of King Dor and Queen Irene, and he has the powerful talent of being able to shapeshift, giving him the power to change into any animal he chooses. While watching the images of the magical tapestry Dolph begins to think about the disappearance of the Good Magician Humphrey. Dolph gets so enraptured with the thought of finding the Magician that he eventually asks his father and mother permission to set out on a quest to find the answers. Queen Irene decides that Dolph is at a fine age to set out for a quest, but as long as he takes with him an adult companion. After some debate and arguing over who should accompany Dolph, Dolph suggests that Marrow Bones accompany him. Marrow is a walking, talking skeleton who has the ability to transform his skeletal body into many shapes as long as Dolph gives him a good kick in the tail bone first.\n\nOnce Dolph and Marrow set out on their journey they realize their first stop must be at the Good Magician Humfrey's castle to investigate for any clues to his disappearance. Once in the castle Dolph and Marrow find a hidden room that can only be viewed through a clear rock from above. In the hidden room is a message that reads \"Skeleton Key to Heaven Cent\". Marrow distinguishes that there is a pun in the message, and a Skeleton Key is really an island made of coral. So Dolph and Marrow set out to find the isle and find the Heaven Cent to bring back the Good Magician Humphrey.\n\nThroughout Dolph and Marrow's adventures through the land of Xanth they encounter many different creatures. There are the always rhyming ogres, bone hungry and smelly harpies, the cruel merwomen, and many others. One of the major creatures that come into play in the book are the nagas. The nagas are a snake-human people who have the power to transform into either a full snake, full human, or mixed form. Dolph and Marrow encounter the nagas when trying to get through a goblin kingdom where the goblins are holding Nada, the naga princess, prisoner. After rescuing Nada, Dolph and Marrow return to the naga kingdom, where Dolph, even though too young, becomes unintentionally betrothed to Nada through a naga tradition. Nada joins Dolph and Marrow on their quest to find the Heaven Cent, and their romantic relationship blossoms until Nada reveals to Dolph that she is actually many years older than he is. Although Dolph is taken aback by this information, his love for Nada does not waver and he keeps the betrothal intact.\n\nWhen Dolph, Marrow, and Nada finally find the right island where the Heaven Cent is supposed to be they encounter a magical castle where a maiden has been under a magical sleep for 900 years of a 1000-year sentence. The sleeping maiden is named Electra, and she was put under the sleeping spell because 900 years ago she accidentally activated the Heaven Cent. Dolph kisses the sleeping Electra and awakens her, but to Dolph's surprise Electra cannot survive unless she marries the person who broke the spell on her.\n\nOnce the entire party returns to Castle Roogna Dolph is left with the decision about what to do with his two betrothed women. After much debate with both women and the King and Queen, Dolph asks for the test of the roses. Dolph chooses the yellow rose for Electra showing friendship and the red rose for Nada representing love. Electra is the first of the betrothed to attempt the test and she quickly chooses the red rose for Dolph representing love. Nada goes second and tries to pick the red rose, but she cannot because she does not truly love him and she is pricked by a rose. Nada then tries to pick a black rose and commit suicide, but Dolph jumps over to her and stops her. Dolph explains that he loves Nada even though the love is not returned. In the end Dolph remains betrothed to each girl even though the King and Queen do not believe in it, but Dolph and the girls believe that, in the next seven years before Dolph can marry, they will work out all the problems.\n\nThe Test of the Roses\nThe test of the roses is when one person stands in the center of a garden of different colored roses. Each rose color stands for a different emotion: white for indifference, yellow for friendship, pink for romance, red for love, and black for death. The person being decided over stands on a pillar in the middle of the garden, then the person trying to show their emotions walks around the garden and picks the appropriate colored rose for how they feel about the person in the middle of the garden.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nGoogle Books excerpt\n\n 11\n1988 American novels\nAvon (publisher) books", "machine_text": "Heaven Cent is a term used in the numismatic world to describe a specific type of United States coin known as the 1793 Chain Cent. This coin holds a special place in American history as the first one-cent coin ever minted by the United States government. The coin features a chain design on the reverse, representing the unity of the newly formed United States of America. However, due to the controversial depiction of chains, the design was later changed to a wreath. The 1793 Chain Cent is made of copper and was struck at the Philadelphia mint in 1793. It has a diameter of approximately 27 millimeters and weighs slightly more than 13 grams. The coin's obverse features a portrait of Liberty facing right, with the words \"Liberty Parent of Science and Industry\" inscribed around the edge. The reverse features the chain design with the words \"United States of America\" inscribed around the edge. The coin's denomination, \"One Cent,\" is inscribed within the chain. The Heaven Cent is a nickname that was created by collectors and investors due to the rarity and high value of the coin. It is estimated that only about 36,000 of these coins were minted, with approximately 1,000-2,000 still in existence. The coin's condition greatly affects its value, with some examples selling for upwards of $1 million. The 1793 Chain Cent was followed by the Liberty Cap Cent, the Draped Bust Cent, and the Braided Hair Cent. However, the chain design of the Heaven Cent remains a significant piece of American history and is highly sought after by collectors. It serves as a reminder of the early days of the United States and the efforts made to establish a new and independent nation.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 4118485}

He played college football with Army and was selected as a first-team All-American in 1914. He became a career officer in the U.S. Army and rose to the rank of major general. He was lifelong friends with West Point classmate Dwight D. \"Ike\" Eisenhower and, during World War II, he commanded the 14th Armored Division in the United States from 1942 to 1944 and the 1st Armored Division from 1944 to 1945 during the Italian Campaign.\n\nEarly years\nA native of Onawa, Iowa, Prichard was the son of attorney J.A. Prichard.  The younger Prichard began his education at Morningside College in Sioux City, Iowa, where he also played football and established a reputation as a passer.  In November 1910, while he was a student at Morningside, Prichard received word that he had been appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York.  He enrolled at West Point on June 11, 1911.\n\nU.S. Military Academy\nWhile serving as a cadet at West Point, Prichard played for the Academy's football and baseball teams.  He gained his greatest fame in football as the quarterback for the Army Black Knights football team from 1912 to 1914.  Prichard's teammates on the Army football teams included two of the leading generals of World War II, Omar Bradley, who played at the end position, and Dwight Eisenhower, who played halfback until a knee injury sidelined him.  James Van Fleet, commander of U.S. forces in the Korean War, also played on the 1914 West Point football team with Prichard.  Although he weighed only 158 pounds, Prichard played every minute of every major game during his three years of varsity football at West Point.\n\nPrichard first gained national attention after an October 1913 game against Colgate University.  Colgate led 6\u20130 with ten seconds left to play, when Prichard sprinted 70 yards for a touchdown to lead Army to a 7\u20136 victory.\n\nThroughout his football career at West Point, Prichard's favorite receiver was Louis A. Merrilat from Chicago.  The passing team of \"Prichard to Merrilat\" was one of the first great passing combinations in college football.  The Prichard-Merrilat combination gained national fame after the 1913 Army\u2013Navy Game, played in New York before a crowd of 40,000 at the Polo Grounds.  Army had not defeated Navy since 1905, and Navy was undefeated and favored to beat Army by odds of 6\u20131.  Although Navy had allowed only seven points in its other games in 1913, Prichard and Merrilat teamed up to lead Army to a 22\u20139 win, with Prichard throwing two touchdown passes to Merrilat. The crowd reportedly left the Polo Grounds chanting, \"Prichard-to-Merillat, Prichard-to-Merillat\u00a0...\"\nover and over again.\n\nOn the train trip back to West Point after the 1913 Navy game, the football team elected Prichard as the captain of the 1914 football team.  A newspaper report announcing his election noted:\n\nThe football squad elected its next year's captain on the train trip home.  They chose Cadet Vernon E. Prichard of the second class as their leader.  Cadet Prichard has played quarterback on the team for two seasons and got in every game except one on the army's schedule this season.  His brilliant forward passing, spectacular open field running and excellent generalship have made him one of the season's leading quarterbacks. ... His election was unanimous.  He is a color sergeant in the cadet battalion and popular with his teammates and fellow cadets.\n\nIn 1914, Prichard led Army to an undefeated 9\u20130 season.  In the final game of the season, Army defeated Navy, 20\u20130, as Prichard finished his college football career by throwing passes to Merrilat and Bob Neyland, who later became the football coach at the University of Tennessee.  At the end of the season, Prichard was selected as a first-team All-American quarterback.\n\nAt West Point, Prichard was known to his fellow cadets by the nicknames \"Prich\" and \"Nigger\".  A profile of Prichard in a West Point yearbook noted:\n\nIt's hard to tell the truth about Prich for no one knows just what it is. Some move him right up beside St. Peter and hand him a 'New Model Harp' with printed directions for playing, while others give him a dog's name and call him Nigger.  But wherever you rank him, it's a safe bet that he'll feel right at home.  He'll borrow his Satanic Majesty's opera cloak for the first night or slap the old Saint on the back and ask him for Bull and papers.\"\n\nMilitary career\n\nEarly years\nUpon graduating from the Academy in June 1915, Prichard received the rank of second lieutenant and was assigned to the 1st Infantry Regiment. He served at Eagle Pass, Texas, from September 1915 to April 1916 and participated in the Pancho Villa Expedition into Mexico from April to August 1916. While serving in Mexico, Prichard was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant. Prichard returned to West Point for temporary duty during the fall of 1916 but returned to Mexico from December through February 1917.\n\nWorld War I\nIn May 1917, a month following the American entry into World War I, Prichard was promoted to the rank of captain of the Infantry Branch. He sailed for the Western Front via England on January 8, 1918. He entered Germany with the Army of Occupation via Belgium and Luxembourg and served in Germany and France through June 1919.\n\nWorld War II\nPrichard remained lifelong friends with his backfield partner, Dwight D. \"Ike\" Eisenhower. Eisenhower later recalled that he looked for \"natural leaders\" from the ranks of football. Eisenhower believed that football, more than any other sport, instilled the belief that victory comes from teamwork and dedication. He identified Prichard as one of the officers with football background who had \"measured up\" during the war.\n\nChoosing to remain in the army in the period between the wars, during World War II, Prichard served as the Commanding Officer (CO) of the 27th Field Artillery Regiment from 1940\u201341. He served as chief of staff of the 4th Armored Division from 1941\u201342 and as Commanding General (CG) of the 14th Armored Division from November 1942 until July 1944. From July 1944 until September 1945, after the end of World War II in Europe, he was the CG of the 1st \"Old Ironsides\" Armored Division during the Italian Campaign, including the Battle of the Gothic Line, Po Valley and the Spring 1945 offensive in Italy.\n\nPrichard and Eisenhower exchanged correspondence during the war.  Shortly after the United States entered the war, in December 1941, Eisenhower wrote a letter to Prichard in which he confided \"this is a long tough road we have to travel.\" In an oft-quoted passage, Eisenhower continued his comments to Prichard, noting that \"men that can do things are going to be sought out just as surely as the sun rises in the morning,\" and \"fake reputations, habits of glib and clever speech, and glittering surface performances are going to be discovered.\"\n\nDuring the Battle of the Bulge in late December 1944, Prichard wrote to Eisenhower, reminding him of what their football coach had taught them: \"If things break badly or go against you -- stay with it all the harder.\" Eisenhower's biographer, Matthew Holland, later wrote that Eisenhower had learned important lessons on the football playing field at West Point, and concluded: \"World War II was won on the playing fields of West Point, and Ike would prove to be the quarterback of the winning team.\"\n\nAfter World War II, Prichard became the Chief of the Army Public Information Division. In February 1949, President Harry S. Truman promoted Prichard from the rank of brigadier general to major general.\n\nDeath and funeral\nPrichard was killed in a yacht explosion in July 1949.  He was part of a group that had boarded the yacht Halcyon for a picnic cruise on the Potomac River in Washington, D.C.  The craft was within yards of the dock at the Corinthian Yacht Club when an explosion destroyed the vessel.  Prichard was thrown into the Potomac and killed instantly.  Navy Commodore Wilfred Painter was also killed in the blast.  Philadelphia soldier, diplomat and socialite Col. Anthony Joseph Drexel Biddle, Jr. dove into the Potomac in an effort to save Prichard and recovered his body.\n\nPrichard's funeral was held at the chapel of Fort Myer, adjacent to Arlington National Cemetery.  The Army's chief of chaplains officiated at the funeral, and the honorary pallbearers included Secretary of the Army, Gordon Gray, and classmates from the West Point Class of 1915, including Dwight Eisenhower.\n\nDecorations\nHere is the ribbon bar of Major General Prichard:\n\nSee also\n1914 College Football All-America Team\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nGenerals of World War II\n\n|-\n\n1892 births\n1949 deaths\nAmerican football quarterbacks\nArmy Black Knights baseball players\nArmy Black Knights football players\nMorningside Mustangs football players\nUnited States Army generals\nUnited States Army Command and General Staff College alumni\nRecipients of the Distinguished Service Medal (US Army)\nRecipients of the Legion of Merit\nOfficiers of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur\nRecipients of the Croix de Guerre 1939\u20131945 (France)\nRecipients of the Czechoslovak War Cross\nBurials at Arlington National Cemetery\nPeople from Monona County, Iowa\nGraduates of the United States Military Academy Class of 1915\nUnited States Army personnel of World War I\nUnited States Army generals of World War II\nMilitary personnel from Iowa", "machine_text": "Vernon Prichard was a prominent American architect who is best known for his work in the early to mid-twentieth century. He was born in 1905 in Omaha, Nebraska, and grew up in a family of artists and designers. His father, a successful businessman, was an amateur painter, and his mother taught art and design at a local community college. Prichard was initially drawn to art and design and studied at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln before transferring to the University of Pennsylvania's School of Architecture. He graduated with a Bachelor of Architecture from Penn in 1930 and worked for several years in Philadelphia before moving to New York City in 1934. In New York, he worked for several prominent firms, including James Gamble Rogers and Shreve, Lamb, and Harmon. In 1940, Prichard opened his own firm in New York City, initially partnering with the architect Edward Larrabee Barnes. Together, they designed a number of notable buildings, including the Marine Midland Bank building in New York City and the SUNY Albany Campus Center. Throughout his career, Prichard was known for his innovative use of materials and for his elegant, functional designs. He was particularly interested in the integration of architecture with the natural environment, and many of his buildings feature dramatic views, natural light, and landscaping. He also believed in the importance of incorporating art and design into architecture, and he often collaborated closely with artists to create unique installations and features within his buildings. Prichard received numerous awards and accolades for his work over the course of his career, including the Gold Medal of the American Institute of Architects in 1972. He died in 1997 at the age of 91, leaving behind a legacy of elegant, innovative, and influential architecture.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 26374342}

He was born in Boston, Massachusetts in 1900. Sears studied at Harvard, earning his bachelor's degree in 1922, his master's degree in 1923, and his PhD in 1926. After graduation, Sears became a professor of education at Harvard, where he taught from 1926 until 1934. He then moved to the University of Chicago where he served as professor of education and history until his retirement in 1968. While at the University of Chicago, Sears also served as dean of the Graduate School of Education (1945-1950). Sears was an influential figure in the field of education and made significant contributions to educational theory and policy. In his 1951 book The Youth Corridor, he argued that the nation's schools needed to focus on the development of students' personal and social growth, rather than just academic achievement. He emphasized that schools needed to help students develop a sense of responsibility and community, and that education was a tool for promoting social progress and economic growth. In the 1950s, Sears became involved in politics and served as a policy advisor to several politicians. He worked for Adlai Stevenson's presidential campaign in 1956 and was a member of the White House Task Force on Education during the Kennedy administration. In addition to his academic and political work, Sears was also a writer. He wrote several books on education and history, including The Horace Mann-Lemuel Shaw Letters (1940), The Life of George William Curtis (1951), and The School as a Social Institution (1959). Sears's contributions to education and politics were widely recognized during his lifetime. He was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and received the George Washington Medal of Achievement from the Freedom Foundation in 1963. Although he died in 1990, Sears's work continues to be influential in the fields of education and politics.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 62580177}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Ducati Desmosedici\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Ducati Desmosedici is a four-stroke V4 engine racing motorcycle made by Ducati for MotoGP racing. The series nomenclature is GP with the two-digit year appended, such as Desmosedici GP10 for 2010. In 2006 Ducati made a short production run of 1,500 street-legal variants, the Desmosedici RR.\n\nBackground \nDucati abandoned the Grand Prix racing scene at the start of the 1970s. For many years the 500 class was essentially a class for two-stroke motorcycles, an engineering technology that was far removed from the four-stroke road-going machines sold by Ducati. Technical rules changed in 2002, giving priority to four-stroke machinery and turning the 500 class of World Road Racing into the MotoGP Championship. This convinced Ducati to make a much-awaited return to the track in the new MotoGP class.\n\nDucati history is classically based on 90\u00b0 V-twin (or L-twin) engines, using desmodromic valve technology. Initially, Ducati considered the possibility of creating a MotoGP 'super-twin', taking advantage of the MotoGP regulations that give twin-cylinder machines a considerable weight reduction over four, five or six-cylinder bikes. However, analysis indicated that a twin-cylinder engine would not have been able to produce the required amount of power, without excessively increasing the number of revs. A twin would have had to rev at over 17,000\u00a0rpm, but this would require a very short stroke and a very large bore, as a result producing possible combustion problems.\n\nThe basis of the design of the Desmosedici engine therefore is two classical Ducati L-twins next to each other, making a Double L-twin with two-cylinder Stroking at the same time (also called Twin Pulse). With four valves per cylinder, the total number of valves is sixteen \u2013 Desmosedici means desmodromic distribution with sixteen valves shortened in Italian.\n\nDesign had started in 2001, the bike was unveiled at the 2002 Italian GP at Mugello, for use in the following seasons MotoGP World Championship. Vittoriano Guareschi, the Ducati Corse test-rider, followed every phase of the Desmosedici's development process from early testing to track debut and the project's evolution. In 2007, Ducati's pilot Casey Stoner, riding a Desmosedici, obtained Ducati's first MotoGP World Championship title.\n\nIn early 2021, Ducati rider Johann Zarco set the highest trap speed record in competition practice on the Desmosedici.\n\nGP3 \nWhile still fully committed to Superbike racing, the Ducati Marlboro Team of Loris Capirossi and Troy Bayliss would compete in all rounds of the 2003 MotoGP championship. The Desmosedici GP3 quickly scored a series of results with Loris Capirossi, who stepped onto the podium in the opening round of the championship in Japan and won the GP Catalunya in Barcelona. Riders Capirossi finished fourth in the final championship standings and Bayliss sixth; while Ducati finished second overall in the Manufacturers' standings.\n\nGP4 \nIn 2004 the Desmosedici GP4, again in the hands of Capirossi and Bayliss, underwent a series of major modifications. A large part of the season went by before the bike became competitive, but the season concluded with both riders on the podium.\n\nGP5 \n\nThe GP5 version lined up for Ducati's third season in MotoGP, with Bayliss replaced by the Spanish rider Carlos Checa. Thanks to a collaboration agreement with Bridgestone, Ducati could finally contribute to the development of new tyres and by the end of the season the Desmosedici became a competitive machine. Bridgestone found that hard tyres suited the bike more than softer tyres to create grip, allowing it to spin the rear wheel gave better control. Capirossi took two wins in the Grand Prix of Japan at Motegi and in the Malaysian GP at Sepang, while Checa scored a brace of podium finishes.\n\nGP6 \nLaunched at the Italian skiing resort of Madonna di Campiglio, the GP6 is a lighter and more powerful version of the GP5. Involving better aerodynamics and a better fuel tank position, most importantly, although more powerful, the engine delivery was smoothened to make the bike more rideable. This made the bike slower on top speed, but quicker into, around and out of corners.\n\nThe new rider with Capirossi was Spanish rider Sete Gibernau. After encouraging winter tests, the Desmosedici GP6 took its first win of 2006 in the opening GP at Jerez de la Frontera, Spain, followed by a podium in Qatar. Capirossi led the championship for a short while, but at the start of the Grand prix de Catalunya at Barcelona, Gibernau's bike collided with Capirossi's after Gibernau braked too late and compressed his brake lever further after impacting it on the back of Capirossi's bike. Both riders ended up injured and in the hospital, with Gibernau sustaining a broken collar bone, and both missed the Dutch Grand Prix at Assen. Capirossi returned at the British Grand Prix, while Gibernau was replaced by German Alex Hofmann for the Dutch Grand Prix, the British Grand Prix, and also the Czech Grand Prix after undergoing additional surgery. With Gibernau  sidelined for the final round of the season at Valencia following a collision with Casey Stoner, Ducati recalled Bayliss, who was recently crowned World Superbike champion. The race was won by Bayliss, his first MotoGP victory, with Capirossi taking second place for the first Ducati 1\u20132 finish.\n\nGP7 \nFor 2007, MotoGP rules were changed to cap motors to a maximum displacement of 800\u00a0cc. In response, Ducati built the GP7. Its specifications were: 800\u00a0cc bike, double L-Twin motor (4 Cylinder Twin Pulse).\n\nDucati started its project to build an 800\u00a0cc MotoGP bike extremely early and according to Ducati's racing chief Filippo Preziosi, by August 2006 Ducati had already built twenty 800\u00a0cc engines with various specifications. In addition, an early version of the bike was track tested for the first time during early May 2006. Public testing with the bike began at the Brno Track, where Loris Capirossi had won the day before riding the GP6, on the 21st of August. Capirossi's lap times on the prototype GP7 were only 1.4 seconds off his track record time set on the 990\u00a0cc GP6.\n\nFurther testing of the GP7 in Motegi, Japan, revealed that the 800\u00a0cc machine could run faster laps than the higher-displacement 990\u00a0cc bikes, and held nearly a second advantage over the next fastest 800\u00a0cc bike, a Honda ridden by Dani Pedrosa.\n\nMotoGP's 800\u00a0cc era officially began with the first race of the 2007 MotoGP season, at the Losail International Circuit in Qatar. Casey Stoner won the race on the new GP7. The bike had a clear top speed advantage over the rest of the grid, due to its higher output motor. A new track record was set on the GP7. Second place contender and five time World champion, Yamaha's Valentino Rossi, realised that \"unfortunately, there was too much difference between (our) bikes in the straight\" and \"Our Yamaha will never go as quick on a straight as the Ducati.\" These words turned out to be true, as the GP7 enjoyed a top speed advantage throughout the season, although the other manufacturers (Yamaha, Honda, Kawasaki and Suzuki) closed the gap significantly by the end of the year. Stoner and his Bridgestone-shod Ducati proved to be the top combination in MotoGP and he won the world championship at Motegi, Japan, on September 23, 2007, four races before the end of the season.\n\nGP8 \n\nAn update of the GP7 design, Ducati's entry for the 2008 MotoGP World Championship was tested first in February 2007.\n\nFor purposes of avoiding chatter which was encountered on some occasions with GP7, the rigidity of the GP8's frame was altered, although further details of relevant modifications are not disclosed. In addition, in an attempt to reduce an effect described as \"pumping\", some modifications to the bike's suspension geometry were made.\n\nAs with its predecessor the GP8 contains a four-cylinder 800\u00a0cc engine with desmodromic actuation of its 16 valves. The engine has improved mid-range response and top-end power compared to that of the GP7.\n\nThroughout 2007, Ducati tested a special fuel-saving clutch arrangement which disengaged the clutch during braking and reduced fuel consumption, however the arrangement was not incorporated in the GP8 as various advanced lubricants and fuels used with the GP8 are believed to provide comparable fuel savings, while decreasing internal engine friction and increasing maximum power.\n\nIn race trim, the bike recorded an official top speed of  at the 2008 Chinese motorcycle Grand Prix.\n\nGP9 \nThe GP9 was Ducati's entry for the 2009 MotoGP World Championship. Ducati began testing it on track prior to May 2008.  On 9 June 2008, Ducati publicly rolled out the Desmosedici GP9 for testing at Circuit de Catalunya.\n\nA distinctive feature of GP9 is its carbon fibre chassis, representing a departure from Ducati's traditional steel trellis chassis. Although carbon fibre chassis were tried in mid 1980s, currently no other MotoGP racing team uses them.\n\nGP10 \nOn January 15, 2010, Ducati introduced the GP10 for the 2010 MotoGP season. Development concentrated on improving engine longevity, to keep within new engine restrictions, and rideability. Most notably, the GP10 makes use of a big-bang firing order for the first time since the Desmosedici changed from the 990\u00a0cc to the 800\u00a0cc engine capacity. Ducati also redesigned the fairing, first seen at the 2009 Estoril round.\n\nGP11 \nOn January 12, 2011, Ducati introduced the GP11 for the 2011 MotoGP season. The bike was raced by Valentino Rossi and Nicky Hayden.\n\nGP12 \nOn March 19, 2012, Ducati unveiled the GP12 for the 2012 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season which incorporated new displacement standards of up to 1,000\u00a0cc in capacity. The bike was raced by Valentino Rossi and Nicky Hayden.\n\nGP16 \nThe Desmosedici GP16 was unveiled in February 2016. It ran the first two pre-season tests with race riders Andrea Dovizioso and Andrea Iannone without a livery. Ducati's MotoGP boss Gigi Dall'Igna describes the 2016 Desmosedici as an \"evolution\" of its recent challengers. The GP16 was still the fastest bike in a straight line with its extra power. The winglets remained from the previous year, albeit now coloured to match the predominantly white and red Desmosedici.\n\nIn the 10th round of the season in Austria, Ducati dominated all sessions. Andrea Iannone and Andrea Dovizioso qualified 1st and 3rd respectively. In the race, Ducati used their lack of wheelies and extra power to stretch out a gap to Jorge Lorenzo after some laps. The two bikes stayed together, with Dovizioso in first for most of the race. But Iannone out-braked him and took the lead into the penultimate corner of the last lap. The win was the first for Iannone in MotoGP and his first since Moto2 Italy 2012. The win was the first for Ducati (and any other manufacturer than Honda or Yamaha) since Casey Stoner won for the team in 2010 Australian Grand Prix. Dovizioso finished in 2nd place to mark the first Ducati 1\u20132 finish since the 2007 Australian Grand Prix.\n\nIn the 17th round of the season at the newly resurfaced Sepang International Circuit in Malaysia, Dovizioso took his second pole of the year in wet conditions. At the start, he fell back to 4th while Iannone, who had qualified in 6th place, led briefly before falling to 2nd place. He stayed there till he crashed at Turn 9. That left Valentino Rossi with Dovizioso at the front and Jorge Lorenzo in a distant 3rd place. Rossi ran wide at turn 1 some laps later and fell back by around 1+ seconds per lap. 'DesmoDovi' held on for his first win with Ducati and his first win since his victory at Donington Park with the Repsol Honda Team in 2009.\n\nDesmosedici RR \n\nThe Desmosedici RR is a road-legal version of the Desmosedici, first delivered in early 2008.\n\nComplete MotoGP results\n\nMotorcycle summary\nThese results are accurate up to the 2021 Valencian Community motorcycle Grand Prix.\n\nWorld Championship titles:\nRiders: 1 (Casey Stoner )\nTeams: 2 (Ducati Marlboro Team , Ducati Lenovo Team )\nConstructors: 3 (, , )\n\nRaces won: 58\n2003: Capirossi 1 (1 in total)\n2005: Capirossi 2 (2 in total)\n2006: Capirossi 3, Bayliss 1 (4 in total)\n2007: Stoner 10, Capirossi 1 (11 in total)\n2008: Stoner 6 (6 in total)\n2009: Stoner 4 (4 in total)\n2010: Stoner 3 (3 in total)\n2016: Iannone 1, Dovizioso 1 (2 in total)\n2017: Dovizioso 6 (6 in total)\n2018: Dovizioso 4, Lorenzo 3 (7 in total)\n2019: Dovizioso 2, Petrucci 1 (3 in total)\n2020: Dovizioso 1, Petrucci 1 (2 in total)\n2021: Miller 2, Mart\u00edn 1, Bagnaia 4 (7 in total)\n\nPoles: 55\n2003: Capirossi 3 (3 in total)\n2005: Capirossi 3 (3 in total)\n2006: Capirossi 2, Gibernau 1 (3 in total)\n2007: Stoner 5 (5 in total)\n2008: Stoner 9 (9 in total)\n2009: Stoner 3 (3 in total)\n2010: Stoner 4 (4 in total)\n2014: Dovizioso 1 (1 in total)\n2015: Dovizioso 1, Iannone 1 (2 in total)\n2016: Dovizioso 2, Iannone 1 (3 in total)\n2018: Lorenzo 4, Dovizioso 2, Miller 1 (7 in total)\n2020: Zarco 1 (1 in total)\n2021: Bagnaia 6, Mart\u00edn 4, Zarco 1 (11 in total)\n\nDucati Desmosedici results\n(key) (results in bold indicate pole position; results in italics indicate fastest lap)\n\nNotes\n\n1 Being his final MotoGP race, Capirossi switched numbers for Valencia as a memorial to his fallen countryman Marco Simoncelli, killed at Sepang, by racing with No. 58 that Simoncelli used, instead of his normal No. 65.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Ars Electronica\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Ars Electronica Linz GmbH is an Austrian cultural, educational and scientific institute active in the field of new media art, founded in Linz in 1979. It is based at the Ars Electronica Center (AEC), which houses the Museum of the Future, in the city of Linz. Ars Electronica's activities focus on the interlinkages between art, technology and society. It runs an annual festival, and manages a multidisciplinary media arts R&D facility known as the Futurelab. It also confers the Prix Ars Electronica awards.\n\nHistory\n\nArs Electronica began with its first festival in September 1979. Its founders were Hannes Leopoldseder, Hubert Bognermayr, Herbert W. Franke, and Ulrich R\u00fctzel. The festival was held biennially at first, and annually since 1986. The Prix Ars Electronica was inaugurated in 1987 and has been awarded every year since then. Ars Electronica Linz GmbH was incorporated as a limited company in 1995. The Ars Electronica Center, together with the Futurelab, opened in 1996, and was remodeled in 2009.\n\nFunding is provided by the City of Linz, the Province of Upper Austria and the Republic of Austria, in addition to private partners. Since 2014, the organization has been headed by artistic director Gerfried Stocker and financial director Diethard Schwarzmair.\n\nMuseum exhibits \nThe top of the AEC is called the Sky Media Loft, which is mainly used as a coffee house or bar of the museum. It can also be rented out for meetings or events. The bar has occasionally been used as the studio for the newscast of the local TV branch of the Austrian national TV organization ORF. The specialty of the Sky Media Loft is the marvelous view over the Nibelungenbr\u00fccke and the main place of Linz at the other side of the Danube which functions as background of the newscasts.\n\nThe second floor is where people can interact with exhibits. There are Musicbottles containing different types of music or Pingpongplus which is a table tennis game on a desk with virtual water on its surface.\n\nThe first floor has displays about the world that had been hidden from our eyes. In the \"Hidden Worlds\" various machines are translating voice and words into virtual symbols or colors and everyday life articles can be moved on a screen if they are touched.\n\nThe little room between the first and the ground floor one of the main attractions is offered. The flight simulator \"Humphrey\" uses virtual reality goggles to give users a simulated view of the flight and the person taking the trip is connected to the computer by cables fixed all over the body. It is possible to fly everywhere and to see the movements of the hands, feet, and the landscape if the visitor raises the head or looks down.\n\nThe entrance or the so-called \"Login Gateway\" of the museum is on the ground floor and leads the newcomer directly to the Telegarden, where a robot is looking after a flower patch. Every ticket is provided with a bar code that gives information about the time the visitor entered the museum. After the visit, the ticket can be put into a computer near the exit and it gives statistic information about the things that happened in the world during the span of the stay in the AEC. The list that is printed out gives information about how many people died or were born during that time or how many accidents have been caused by drunken drivers.\n\nThe last floor is called Virtual Reality and it can be found in the basement of the building. The CAVE is another attraction of the museum. The cube with 3 meters side length is used as a screen to project the virtual world. There are always groups of about 10 that dive into a world where physical laws do not have any meaning. Additionally, the 3D spectacles give the impression of a bodyful environment.\n\nMuseum 2009\u2013present\nThe new Ars Electronica Center, which was designed by Treusch architecture ZT GmbH, opened its doors on 2 January 2009 after roughly two years of construction work and an approximate cost of 30 million euros. It now has 3000 square meters for exhibitions, 100\u00a0m2 for research and development, 400\u00a0m2 for workshops and conferences, 650\u00a0m2 for catering and another 1000\u00a0m2 of public space for various types of events.\n\nThe new AEC consists of the original building, a new \"twin-tower\", the main exhibition hall called Main Gallery and the new space for the Ars Electronica Futurelab. The whole building is covered with a 5000-square-meter glass skin that consists of 1100 glass panels. Each panel is equipped with an LED bar that allows it to change its color. Therefore, the whole building acts as a giant display. Artists can create their own visualizations which will be shown on various occasions, especially during the Ars Electronica Festival.\n\nThe restaurant is located on the third floor of the new building and is called CUBUS, referring to the building's cubic shape.\n\nMuseum exhibits \nWith the new building came a new thematic orientation inside of Ars Electronica. Life sciences, global developments (e.g. climate change, population growth, environmental pollution) and the exploration of the universe are just a view of various new topics.\nThe museum can be separated into the following areas:\n\nMain Gallery \nThe Main Gallery with approximately 1000 square meters houses the main exhibition called New Views of Humankind, which focuses on topics like biotechnology, robotics, rapid prototyping and the human body. It is separated into the following four so-called \"labs\":\n\nBrain-Lab focuses on the human brain, perception and advances in medicine.\nBio-Lab focuses on biotechnology and its applications.\nFab-Lab deals with new possibilities offered by 3D printers and rapid prototyping.\nRobo-Lab deals with robotica as well as different prothetic systems.\n\nMain Gallery contains a special area for children which is not thematically connected to the main exhibition.\n\nGeo City \nGeo City focuses on global developments caused by humankind, like growth in population and the extraction of natural resources. Those global developments are connected with possible local reactions, which is visualized in an interactive city information system called Sim-Linz.\n\nArtists, Creators, Engineers \nThis is the area for temporary exhibitions on the first and second floor of the original building and focuses on the interdisciplinary aspects of Ars Electronica and its contributors.\n\nDeep Space \nThe Deep Space is a multifunctional presentation room that offers a wide range of possibilities. It consists of two walls (front and floor) with dimensions of 16\u00a0\u00d7 9 meters which serve as screens for eight Galaxy NH-12 projectors by Barco. The projects range from high-resolution videos to scientific (3D) visualizations like a flight out from the solar system to the whole known universe and artistic projects.\n\nFutureLab \nThe same building holds the Ars Electronica FutureLab, a place for researching and trying out new cyberarts technologies.  See also the Prix Ars Electronica, a yearly award ceremony given out by Ars Electronica at their cyberarts festival.  Since 2004, one of the awards at the Prix Ars Electronica brings a young innovator or team of innovators to the FutureLab for a summer to develop a budding idea or technology in electronic media.\n\nFestival\n\nThe annual Ars Electronica Festival is a gathering of artists, scientists and technologists, intended as \"a setting for experimentation, evaluation and reinvention\". The festival has always exerted a public presence in Linz, mounting large-scale open-air projects and holding  lectures, discussions and workshops in a wide range of public venues.\n\nEach year the festival is devoted to a specific theme. The festival in 2014, had as its theme \"C... What it Takes to Change\", i.e. ways in which social change and innovation can be promoted. It attracted 579 participants and about 85,000 visitors.\n\nFeatures at the 2014 festival\n\nDevice art\n\nA form of concept art, device art has been described as \"a rebellion of form, taking everyday objects and inverting them to tell you something different\". Among the examples exhibited at the 2014 festival were:\n \"Otamatone\" \u2013 a musical instrument shaped like a musical note.\n \"Food Simulator\", in which a pressure sensor in the user's mouth simulates the sensation of chewing food.\n \"Lenticular Bicycle\" - an old fashioned bicycle with a screen carousel mounted above the handlebars, known as \"Sustainable Cinema No. 2\" and created by Scott Hessels.\n A robot that performs street begging, made from recycled computer parts, with a voice and robotic hands.\n \"Touchy\", a \"human camera\", devised by the Hong Kong-based artist Eric Suiss.\n\nSmart atoms (spaxels)\nA version called \"Smart atoms: spaxels version\" was developed by Ars Electronica Futurelab and shown at the 2014 festival.\n\nPrix Ars Electronica\n\nThe Prix Ars Electronica is an annual award made in several categories, \"honoring creativity and innovativeness in the use of digital media\". Award winners are selected by a five-person international expert jury, who may themselves propose candidates. The prize may be awarded to individuals or to teams or organizations, and may be awarded for a specific work of art or for another form of innovation. Grover (2008) has described the top-ranking award, the Golden Nica, as \"the Oscar of digital art\".\n\nThe prize was first awarded in 1987, and there have been several changes in the categories since then. In 2014, there were 2,703 entries from 77 countries.

Wiktionary\n\nComment\nTrent Nathaniel Grover has included an appendix about Ars Electronica in his book Dream of the Techno-Shaman (2008). He describes the institute's activities as \"a unique platform for exploring, discussing, tracking, and analyzing the interrelation between art, technology, and society\". Such work, he argues, affirms the place of the human being at the center of techno-cultural processes, as \"beneficiaries, victims, and, above all, creators and appliers of new technology\". Noting that the rapid pace of technological innovation has profound implications for culture and society, he presents the role of Ars Electronica as working to integrate developments in technology with art and society to the benefit of all, and contrasts this perspective with the Modernist call for \"art for art's sake\".\n\nGrover concludes by hoping that Ars Electronica \"will be able to maintain its ongoing quest for innovation and expansion so that we can all benefit from and further involve ourselves in the integration of art, technology, and society\".\n\nPublications\nGrover (2008) has described the published work of Ars Electronica as \"a compelling snapshot of codependent technological and artistic development with expansive and lasting social and cultural impact.\"\n\n Cyberarts 98: .net, Interactive Art, Computer Animation/Visual Effects, Computer Music, U19/Cybergeneration.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Italian dressing\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Italian dressing is a vinaigrette-type salad dressing in American cuisine that consists of water, vinegar or lemon juice, vegetable oil, chopped bell peppers, sugar or corn syrup, herbs and spices (including oregano, fennel, dill and salt) and sometimes onion and garlic. \n\nThe creamy Italian variant adds milk products and stabilizers.\n\nItalian and creamy Italian dressings are often bought bottled, or prepared by mixing oil and vinegar with a packaged flavoring mix consisting of dehydrated vegetables and herbs.\n\nDespite its name, Italian dressing is not used in Italy, where salad is normally dressed with olive oil, vinegar or lemon juice, salt, and sometimes balsamic vinegar at the table, and not with a pre-mixed vinaigrette. \n\nIn North American cuisine, Italian dressing is also used as a marinade for meat or vegetables, for stir-frys, and on sandwiches. Pasta salads sometimes include Italian dressing. The caloric content of Italian dressing varies widely.\n\nHistory\n\nKen's\nNorth American style Italian salad dressing is thought to date back to 1941 in Framingham, Massachusetts. Florence Hanna, the daughter of Italian immigrants and wife of restaurateur Ken Hanna, made large batches of her family's salad dressing for the house salads at the restaurant. The restaurant, originally called The '41 Cafe, later changed locations and became known as Ken's Steak House. The salad dressing became so popular that it was made in large vats in the basement of Ken's to keep up with demand. Customers started requesting the Italian dressing to go. The Crowley family, who owned a nearby manufacturing business, approached the Hanna family about bottling the popular salad dressing. This resulted in the creation of Ken's Salad Dressing, which now comes in several variations of Italian, as well as many other flavors.\n\nWish-Bone\nItalian salad dressing was also served in Kansas City, Missouri, at the Wishbone Restaurant beginning in 1948. The Wishbone had been opened in 1945 by Phillip Sollomi along with Lena Sollomi, Phillip's mother. The Italian dressing served at the Wishbone was based on a recipe from Lena Sollomi's Sicilian family which was a blend of oil, vinegar, herbs and spices. Demand for the salad dressing proved so high that Phillip started a separate operation to produce it for sale, making it by the barrel. The dressing recipe was eventually purchased by Lipton and has been made commercially by a succession of owners since, generating an entire Wish-Bone brand of products currently made by Pinnacle Foods, Inc.\n\nReferences\n\nSalad dressings\nItalian-American cuisine\nAmerican condiments", "machine_text": "Italian dressing is a type of salad dressing that is commonly used in Italian cuisine. It is known for its tangy and flavorful taste and is a popular dressing for salads, pasta dishes, and sandwiches. The dressing is typically made with a combination of vinegar, oil, herbs, and spices, giving it a unique flavor that is synonymous with Italian cuisine. The origins of Italian dressing can be traced back to the early 1900s in the United States, where Italian immigrants adapted traditional dressing recipes to suit the American palate. Over time, the recipe evolved to include ingredients like garlic, oregano, basil, and red wine vinegar, creating the distinct flavor profile that is now associated with Italian dressing. Italian dressing is known for its versatility and ability to enhance the flavor of many dishes. It is a popular choice for salads, as it can add a bold flavor without overpowering the other ingredients. The dressing is also commonly used as a marinade for meats, giving them a tangy and herbaceous flavor. Italian dressing can also be used as a dipping sauce for vegetables and bread, making it a favorite among many. Despite its popularity, Italian dressing has come under scrutiny in recent years due to its high sodium and sugar content. As a result, many companies have developed low-sodium and sugar-free versions of the dressing to cater to health-conscious consumers. Overall, Italian dressing is a flavorful and versatile addition to any meal. Whether used as a salad dressing, marinade, or dipping sauce, it adds a bold flavor that is sure to please.

The quintet originally consisted of Joe Roland on vibraphone, Buzzy Drootin on drums, Murray Wall on bass, Milt Yaner on trumpet, and Al Cohn on tenor sax. The group's first recordings were made in 1954 for the Prestige label. Joe Roland Quintette's sound was characterized by Roland's melodic and swinging vibraphone playing, combined with the tight arrangements of the band. Their music was influenced by bebop and hard bop, but also incorporated elements of swing and blues. In addition to their recordings, the Joe Roland Quintette was known for their live performances. They played at many of the top jazz clubs in New York City, including Birdland, the Village Vanguard, and the Half-Note. Unfortunately, the Joe Roland Quintette's success was short-lived.

It was built between 1817 and 1821 for John Strode and was one of the finest examples of Greek Revival architecture in the region. The mansion was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. Rockland was designed by architect John Notman, who was known for his Greek Revival style. The mansion features a large portico supported by four fluted columns, a two-story pedimented entrance, and ornate cornices. The interior of the house features a central hallway with a curved staircase, a ballroom, formal dining room, and parlor. In 1848, Rockland was bought by Adam Stephen Dandridge, a prominent politician and plantation owner. He owned the house until his death in 1889. The house then passed through a number of owners until it was purchased in 1930 by the state of West Virginia. The mansion was used as a girls' school until 1967 and then as the administration building for Shepherd College (now Shepherd University) until 1996.

It is a phrase that is used to express an urgent need for help in a life-threatening situation. The phrase has become so popular that it has been used in various memes, social media posts, and even merchandise. The origins of the phrase can be traced back to the 1967 movie Cool Hand Luke. In the movie, the main character, Luke Jackson, is being punished by prison guards. During the punishment, Luke yells out to one of the guards, \"What we've got here is failure to communicate. Some men you just can't reach. So, you get what we had here last week, which is the way he wants it... well, he gets it. I don't like it any more than you men.\" After this, Luke falls to the ground and yells out, \"Bitch, don't let me die!.\" The phrase has since become a pop culture icon and has been used in various movies and TV shows, including Breaking Bad, The Sopranos, and Orange is the New Black. The popularity of the phrase is not without controversy, as some critics have labeled it as sexist and derogatory. Some argue that the use of the word \"bitch\" reinforces negative stereotypes about women and perpetuates misogyny. Despite the controversy, the phrase continues to be used in popular media and has become a part of modern-day slang. It is often used in a humorous context and has been embraced by many as a way to express urgency in a lighthearted way. In conclusion, Bitch, Don't Let Me Die! is a phrase that has become a pop culture icon and has been used in various movies and TV shows. Despite the controversy surrounding its use of the word \"bitch,\" the phrase remains popular and has been embraced by many as a way to express urgency in a lighthearted way.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 49537431}

The resolution was aimed at reducing tensions between the two countries and finding a peaceful solution to the border dispute. The border conflict, which erupted in 1962, was a result of competing territorial claims by India and China. The conflict started in the Northeastern part of India, which China claims as its own territory. This led to a military confrontation between the two countries, which ended in China's victory. The resolution passed by the Indian Parliament was an attempt to de-escalate tensions between the two countries. It acknowledged the territorial claims of both countries and called for a peaceful resolution of the dispute. The resolution also called for the setting up of a joint border commission to resolve the dispute and prevent any future conflict. The resolution was widely debated in the Indian Parliament, with many members calling for a more assertive stance against China. However, the government of India chose to take a conciliatory approach to de-escalate the situation. Despite the resolution, the border dispute between India and China has yet to be resolved. The two countries have engaged in multiple rounds of talks, but a solution has yet to be found. The conflict remains a major thorn in the relationship between India and China, with both countries accusing each other of territorial aggression. In conclusion, the 1962 Indian parliamentary resolution on China was an important step towards reducing tensions between India and China. The resolution acknowledged the need for a peaceful resolution of the dispute and called for the setting up of a joint border commission. However, the conflict still remains unresolved, and tensions between the two countries continue to persist.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 39426098}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Year of the Spider\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Year of the Spider is the third studio album by American rock band Cold. It was released on May 13, 2003 through Geffen Records. The album was Cold's most commercially successful, debuting at number three on the Billboard album charts, with over 101,000 copies sold in its first week. Early pressings of Year of the Spider were shipped with a DVD and a temporary tattoo of the Cold spider logo. The DVD included the making of the (as well as the actual) video for \"Stupid Girl\", fan testimonials, and some home video shot during the recording of the album. This is also the last album with guitarists Terry Balsamo and Kelly Hayes.\n\nBackground\nA year prior to the album's release, the mellow ballad \"Gone Away\" was released on the WWE Tough Enough 2 soundtrack. Its music video, which met with considerable airplay upon release, listed it as from the album Year of the Spider despite the long wait for its release. \"Gone Away\" was subsequently used as a hidden track; the song begins at 16:06 after 13 minutes and 13 seconds of silence (a reference to the superstitious nature of the band's previous effort 13 Ways to Bleed on Stage). The song \"Came All The Way\" was a B-side, which was cut late from the album. It's mentioned on the back cover of the album's booklet. It was later released on the Psi Ops soundtrack.\n\nThe album was frequently postponed from its projected release date. As early as April 2002, Year of the Spider was scheduled by Geffen for an October 2002 release. Frontman Scooter Ward also expected Elias Soriano of Nonpoint to contribute, but this did not come to fruition.\n\nStyle\nWith producer Howard Benson on hand, Year of the Spider is significantly more commercial than its dark predecessor, 13 Ways to Bleed on Stage. It features a variety of guitar styles, violin, viola, and cello, and digital effects as well as a number of power ballads. While still dwelling on topics like drug abuse and relationships, the deaths of grunge icons (\"The Day Seattle Died\"), and blatant criticism (\"Kill the Music Industry\"). \"Cure My Tragedy\" also deals with the struggle with cancer Scooter Ward's sister was having during the album's recording. This topic would be further explored on A Different Kind of Pain.\n\nSingles\n\"Stupid Girl\", served as the album's lead single and was the only Cold single to crack the Billboard Hot 100, where it peaked at number 87. Its music video garnered frequent airplay as well. Like \"Gone Away\", the introductory song \"Remedy\" was used by WWE as the theme for the Backlash 2003 pay-per-view.\n\nFollowing the release of the album's second single, \"Suffocate\", to radio stations, plans were set-forth for a video to accompany the song. However, for reasons unknown, Geffen refused to make the video or promote the album any further.

It was released in May 2003 under Geffen Records. The album's title is derived from the Chinese zodiac sign, the year of the spider. Overview: The album consists of 12 tracks that were recorded at Studio Four in Philadelphia and produced by the critically acclaimed Howard Benson. The album ventured into different musical styles such as post-grunge, alternative metal, and hard rock. Its themes revolve around isolation, emotional turmoil, and betrayal. The album's lead single, \"Stupid Girl\", was a major hit, reaching the No.15 spot on the Billboard US Modern Rock Chart. The second single, \"Suffocate\", was also successful, peaking at number six on the same chart. Other standout tracks include \"Anatomy of a Tidal Wave,\" \"The Day Seattle Died,\" and \"Black Sunday.\" Reception: Year of the Spider received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the album's production and its singles but criticized it for being derivative. Despite that, it debuted at No. 3 on the US Billboard 200 with 101,000 copies sold in its first week. It was later certified Gold by the RIAA in 2004. Legacy: Year of the Spider remains a significant point in Cold's discography and a cornerstone of early 2000s alternative rock music. It was also the last album to feature guitarist Terry Balsamo, who joined Evanescence the following year. Cold has since continued to release albums and tour in the years after Year of the Spider, and they remain an enduring act for their fans.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1193654}

Born on January 13th, 1853 in Berlin, Billerbeck studied theology and ancient languages at various universities including Berlin, Leipzig, and G\u00f6ttingen. Billerbeck's most significant contribution to New Testament studies is his multi-volume commentary on the Gospels titled \"Commentary on the New Testament from the Talmud and Midrash.\" Published between 1922 and 1928, the commentary explores the Jewish background of the Gospels by examining Jewish literature from the same time period. By doing so, Billerbeck provides valuable insights into the cultural and historical context of the Gospels. In addition to his work on the New Testament, Billerbeck was a prominent scholar of rabbinic literature and Jewish history. He wrote extensively on topics such as the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Talmud, and the history of Judaism. Billerbeck's scholarship was recognized throughout his lifetime. He was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Marburg in 1917 and was a member of several prestigious scholarly societies, including the Berlin Academy of Sciences. Despite his many achievements, Billerbeck's career was not without controversy. He faced criticism from some conservative theologians who disapproved of his use of Jewish sources to interpret the New Testament. However, his work has become widely accepted and influential in modern scholarship. Paul Billerbeck passed away on September 24th, 1932, in Munich.

However, he later converted back to Catholicism and studied for the priesthood in Douai, France. Almond returned to England in 1599 and served as a missionary priest, secretly offering Mass and administering sacraments to the Catholic faithful who were persecuted under English law. In 1612, Almond was arrested and charged with \"compounding with and reconciling to the Church of Rome\" and was imprisoned in Lancaster Castle. He was offered a pardon by the government if he would swear allegiance to the Church of England, but he refused, saying \"I am and ever shall be a Catholic priest.\" On July 5, 1612, Almond was taken to the gallows in Lancaster and hanged, drawn, and quartered. His death was brutal, and witnesses claim he was conscious during the entire ordeal. His last words were \"Jesus, have mercy on me.\" His body parts were scattered across the country as a warning to other Catholics. Almond's execution was part of a wider campaign of persecution against Catholics in England during the 16th and 17th centuries.

Historically, the Ural Mountains have been a crossroad for different empires, tribes, and cultures. It was the home for various tribes, including Bashkirs, Tatars, Udmurts, and Russians, who have established their own states and cultural heritage. The idea of the Ural Republic has gained traction after the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the Ural region's economic decline. The supporters of the Ural Republic argue that the region's abundant natural resources, such as oil, gas, and minerals, would be better managed if controlled by local authorities, rather than being exploited by the Russian government. However, the movement for the Ural Republic has faced opposition from the Russian government, which sees the region as an integral part of the federation. The Russian government has also accused the Ural Republic supporters of being separatists and financed by foreign powers. Political tensions have risen in recent years, with the Ural Republic supporters staging protests and demanding greater autonomy. However, the Russian government has responded with arrests, repression, and censorship. As of yet, the Ural Republic remains a hypothetical state, without clear pathways towards independence.

This painting was inspired by the Third Siege of Missolonghi by the Ottoman forces in 1826, during which many people of the city after the long-time siege (almost a year) decided to attempt a mass breakout (sortie) to escape famine and epidemics. The attempt resulted in a disaster, with the larger part of the Greeks slain.\n\nAnalysis\nGreece is depicted as a kneeling woman who occupies the major part of the painting. She is wearing a traditional Greek costume, her chest being widely bare, and she spreads her arms as a sign of sadness. The hand of a dead victim can be seen protruding from the rubble, beneath her feet. In the background, a dark-complexioned man wearing a yellow turban, who symbolizes the enemy, is planting a flag in the ground.\n\nThe painting borrows elements from Christianity. Indeed, \"Greece adopts the attitude of praying in the early centuries of Christianity. The blue coat and white robe, traditionally attributed to the Immaculate Conception, reinforces this analogy to a secular figure of Mary here. The strength of the image is the sharp contrast between the traditional allegory which induces an idealization of the model, and processing of the scene without any concession to the ideal.\"\n\nReferences\n\n1826 paintings\nPaintings by Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix\nPaintings about the Greek War of Independence\n19th-century allegorical paintings\nAllegorical paintings by French artists", "machine_text": "Greece on the Ruins of Missolonghi is a painting by the French artist Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix, completed in 1826. The painting depicts the scene of the Greek town of Missolonghi, which was besieged by Ottoman forces during the Greek War of Independence. The painting has been described as a powerful symbol of the Greek struggle for freedom and has become one of the most famous works of art from the romantic period. The painting shows a group of Greeks, who are standing defiantly on the ruins of their city, which has been destroyed by Ottoman forces. The figures are portrayed as heroic and valiant, their clothing tattered and their faces stern. The painting is dominated by the figure of a dying man, who has been mortally wounded during the siege. His head is tilted back, and his arms are outstretched as if he is offering his sacrifice for the greater good of his people. Delacroix's painting is a testament to the romantic fascination with the exotic and the heroic. The artist was greatly inspired by the idea of the noble savage, and this can be seen in the painting's portrayal of the Greeks as noble and virtuous, despite their suffering. The painting was also an expression of Delacroix's support for the Greek War of Independence, which he saw as a struggle for freedom and democracy. Greece on the Ruins of Missolonghi was not the first painting to depict the Greek struggle for independence, but it is undoubtedly one of the most famous. The painting has been praised for its powerful and emotional portrayal of the Greek people and their struggle for freedom.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"European mink\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The European mink (Mustela lutreola), also known as the Russian mink and Eurasian mink, is a semiaquatic species of mustelid native to Europe.\n\nIt is similar in colour to the American mink, but is slightly smaller and has a less specialized skull. Despite having a similar name, build and behaviour, the European mink is not closely related to the American mink, being much closer to the European polecat and Siberian weasel (kolonok). The European mink occurs primarily by forest streams unlikely to freeze in winter. It primarily feeds on voles, frogs, fish, crustaceans and insects.\n\nThe European mink is listed by the IUCN as Critically Endangered due to an ongoing reduction in numbers, having been calculated as declining more than 50% over the past three generations and expected to decline at a rate exceeding 80% over the next three generations. European mink numbers began to shrink during the 19th century, with the species rapidly becoming extinct in some parts of Central Europe. During the 20th century, mink numbers declined all throughout their range, the reasons for which having been hypothesised to be due to a combination of factors, including climate change, competition with (as well as diseases spread by) the introduced American mink, habitat destruction, declines in crayfish numbers and hybridisation with the European polecat. In Central Europe and Finland, the decline preceded the introduction of the American mink, having likely been due to the destruction of river ecosystems, while in Estonia, the decline seems to coincide with the spread of the American mink.\n\nEvolution and taxonomy\nFossil finds of the European mink are very rare, thus indicating the species is either a relative newcomer to Europe, probably having originated in North America, or a recent speciation caused by hybridization. It likely first arose in the Middle Pleistocene, with several fossils in Europe dated to the Late Pleistocene being found in caves and some suggesting early exploitation by humans. Genetic analyses indicate, rather than being closely related to the American mink, the European mink's closest relative is the European polecat (perhaps due to past hybridization) and the Siberian weasel, being intermediate in form between true polecats and other members of the genus. The closeness between the mink and polecat is emphasized by the fact the species can hybridize.\n\nSubspecies\n, seven subspecies are recognised.\n\nDescription\n\nBuild\n\nThe European mink is a typical representative of the genus Mustela, having a greatly elongated body with short limbs. However, compared to its close relative, the Siberian weasel, the mink is more compact and less thinly built, thus approaching ferrets and European polecats in build. The European mink has a large, broad head with short ears. The limbs are short, with relatively well-developed membranes between the digits, particularly on the hind feet. The mink's tail is short, and does not exceed half the animal's body length (constituting about 40% of its length). The European mink's skull is less elongated than the kolonok's, with more widely spaced zygomatic arches and has a less massive facial region. In general characteristics, the skull is intermediate in shape between that of the Siberian weasel and the European polecat. Overall, the skull is less specialized for carnivory than that of polecats and the American mink. Males measure  in body length, while females measure . Tail length is  in males and . Overall weight is  . It is a fast and agile animal, which swims and dives skilfully. It is able to run along stream beds, and stay underwater for one to two minutes. When swimming, it paddles with both its front and back limbs simultaneously.\n\nFur\n\nThe winter fur of the European mink is very thick and dense, but not long, and quite loosely fitting. The underfur is particularly dense compared with that of more land-based members of the genus Mustela. The guard hairs are quite coarse and lustrous, with very wide contour hairs which are flat in the middle, as is typical in aquatic mammals. The length of the hairs on the back and belly differ little, a further adaptation to the European mink's semiaquatic way of life. The summer fur is somewhat shorter, coarser and less dense than the winter fur, though the differences are much less than in purely terrestrial mustelids.\n\nIn dark coloured individuals, the fur is dark brown or almost blackish-brown, while light individuals are reddish brown. Fur colour is evenly distributed over the whole body, though in a few cases, the belly is a bit lighter than the upper parts. In particularly dark individuals, a dark, broad dorsal belt is present. The limbs and tail are slightly darker than the trunk. The face has no colour pattern, though its upper and lower lips and chin are pure white. White markings may also occur on the lower surface of the neck and chest. Occasionally, colour mutations such as albinos and white spots throughout the pelage occur. The summer fur is somewhat lighter, and dirty in tone, with more reddish highlights.\n\nDifferences from American mink\nThe European mink is similar to the American mink, but with several important differences. The tail is longer in the American species, almost reaching half its body length. The winter fur of the American mink is denser, longer and more closely fitting than that of the European mink. Unlike the European mink, which has white patches on both upper and lower lips, the American mink almost never has white marks on the upper lip. The European mink's skull is much less specialised than the American species' in the direction of carnivory, bearing more infantile features, such as a weaker dentition and less strongly developed projections. The European mink is reportedly less efficient than the American species underwater.\n\nBehaviour\n\nTerritorial and denning behaviours\n\nThe European mink does not form large territories, possibly due to the abundance of food on the banks of small water bodies. The size of each territory varies according to the availability of food; in areas with water meadows with little food, the home range is , though it is more usual for territories to be . Summer territories are smaller than winter territories. Along shorelines, the length of a home range varies from , with a width of .\n\nThe European mink has both a permanent burrow and temporary shelters. The former is used all year except during floods, and is located no more than  from the water's edge. The construction of the burrow is not complex, often consisting of one or two passages  in diameter and  in length, leading to a nest chamber measuring . Nesting chambers are lined with straw, moss, mouse wool and bird feathers. It is more sedentary than the American mink, and will confine itself for long periods in its burrow in very cold weather.\n\nReproduction and development\nDuring the mating season, the sexual organs of the female enlarge greatly and become pinkish-lilac in colour, which is in contrast with the female American mink, whose organs do not change. In the Moscow Zoo, estrus was observed on 22\u201326 April, with copulation lasting from 15 minutes to an hour. The average litter consists of three to seven kits. At birth, kits weigh about , and grow rapidly, trebling their weight 10 days after birth. They are born blind; the eyes open after 30\u201331 days. The lactation period lasts 2.0 to 2.5 months, though the kits eat solid food after 20\u201325 days. They accompany the mother on hunting expeditions at the age of 56\u201370 days, and become independent at the age 70\u201384 days.\n\nDiet\nThe European mink has a diverse diet consisting largely of aquatic and riparian fauna. Differences between its diet and that of the American mink are small. Voles are the most important food source, closely followed by crustaceans, frogs and water insects. Fish are an important food source in floodlands, with cases being known of European minks catching fish weighing . The European mink's daily food requirement is . In times of food abundance, it caches its food.\n\nRange and status\nThe European mink is mostly restricted to Europe. Its range was widespread in the 19th century, with a distribution extending from northern Spain in the west to the river Ob (just east of the Urals) in the east, and from the Archangelsk region in the north to the northern Caucasus in the south. Over the last 150 years, though, it has severely declined by more than 90% and been extirpated or greatly reduced over most of its former range. The current range includes an isolated population in northern Spain and western France, which is widely disjunct from the main range in Eastern Europe (Latvia, Estonia, Belarus, Ukraine, central regions of European Russia, the Danube Delta in Romania and northwestern Bulgaria). It occurs from sea level to . In Estonia, the European mink population has been successfully re-established on the island of Hiiumaa, and there are plans for repeating the process on the nearby island of Saaremaa.\n\nDecline\n\nThe earliest actual records of decreases in European mink numbers occurred in Germany, having already become extinct in several areas by the middle of the 18th century. A similar pattern occurred in Switzerland, with no records of minks being published in the 20th century. Records of minks in Austria stopped by the late 18th century. By the 1930s-1950s, the European mink became extinct in Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and possibly Bulgaria. In Finland, the main decline occurred in the 1920s-1950s and the species was thought to be extinct in the 1970s, though a few specimens were reported in the 1990s. In Latvia, the European mink was thought to be extinct for years, until a specimen was captured in 1992. In Lithuania, the last specimens were caught in 1978\u201379. The decline of the European mink in Estonia and Belarus was rapid during the 1980s, with only a few small, fragmented populations in the northeastern regions of both countries being reported in the 1990s. The decline of European mink numbers in Ukraine began in the late 1950s, with now only a few small and isolated populations being reported in the upper courses of the Ukrainian Carpathian rivers. Their numbers in Moldova began to drop very quickly in the 1930s, with the last known population having been confined to the lower course of the River Prut on the Romanian border by the late 1980s. In Romania, the European mink was very common and widely distributed, with 8000\u201310,000 being captured in 1960. Currently, Romanian mink populations are confined to the Danube Delta. In European Russia, the European mink was common and widespread in the early 20th century, but began to decline during the 1950s-1970s. The core of their range was in the Tver Region, though they began to decline there by the 1990s, which was worsened by a colonisation of the area by the American mink. Between 1981 and 1989, 388 European minks were introduced to two of the Kurile Islands, though by the 1990s, the population there was found to be lower than that originally released. In France and Spain, an isolated range occurs, extending from Brittany to northern Spain. Data from the 1990s indicate the European mink has disappeared from the northern half of this previous range.\n\nPossible reasons for decline\n\nHabitat loss\nHabitat-related declines of European mink numbers may have started during the Little Ice Age, which was further aggravated by human activity. As the European mink is more dependent on wetland habitats than the American species, its decline in Central Europe, Estonia, Finland, Russia, Moldova and Ukraine has been linked to the drainage of small rivers. In mid-19th-century Germany, for example, European mink populations declined in a decade due to expanded land drainage. Although land improvement and river dredging certainly resulted in population decreases and fragmentation, in areas which still maintain suitable river ecosystems, such as Poland, Hungary, the former Czechoslovakia, Finland and Russia, the decline preceded the change in wetland habitats, and may have been caused by extensive agricultural development.\n\nOverhunting\nThe European mink was historically hunted extensively, particularly in Russia, where in some districts, the decline prompted a temporary ban on mink hunting to let the population recover. In the early 20th century, 40\u201360,000 European minks were caught annually in the Soviet Union, with a record of 75,000 individuals (an estimate which exceeds the modern global European mink population). In Finland, annual mink catches reached 3000 specimens in the 1920s. In Romania, 10,000 minks were caught annually around 1960. However, this reason alone cannot account for the decline in areas where hunting was less intense, such as in Germany.\n\nDecline of crayfish\nThe decline of European crayfish has been proposed as a factor in the drop in mink numbers, as minks are notably absent in the eastern side of the Urals, where crayfish are also absent. The decline in mink numbers has also been linked to the destruction of crayfish in Finland during the 1920s-1940s, when the crustaceans were infected with crayfish plague. The failure of the European mink to expand west to Scandinavia coincides with the gap in crayfish distribution.\n\nCompetition with the American mink and disease\nThe American mink was introduced and released in Europe during the 1920s-1930s. The American mink is less dependent on wetland habitats than the European mink and is 20-40% larger. The impact of feral American minks on European mink populations has been explained through the competitive exclusion principle and because the American mink reproduces a month earlier than the European species, and matings between male American minks and female European minks result in the embryos being reabsorbed. Thus, female European minks impregnated by male American minks are unable to reproduce with their conspecifics. Disease spread by the American mink can also account for the decline. Though the presence of the American mink has coincided with the decline of European mink numbers in Belarus and Estonia, the decline of the European mink in some areas preceded the introduction of the American mink by many years, and there are areas in Russia where the American species is absent, though European mink populations in these regions are still declining.\n\nDiseases spread by the American mink can also account for the decline. Twenty-seven helminth species are recorded to infest the European mink, consisting of 14 trematodes, two cestodes and 11 nematodes. The mink is also vulnerable to pulmonary filariasis, krenzomatiasis and skrjabingylosis. In the Leningrad and Pskov Oblasts, 77.1% of European minks were found to be infected with skrjabingylosis.\n\nHybridisation and competition with the European polecat\n\nIn the early 20th century, northern Europe underwent a warm climatic period which coincided with an expansion of the range of the European polecat. The European mink possibly was gradually absorbed by the polecat due to hybridisation. Also, competition with the polecat has greatly increased, due to landscape change favouring the polecat. There is one record of a polecat attacking a mink and dragging it to its burrow.\n\nPolecat-mink hybrids are termed khor'-tumak by furriers and khonorik by fanciers. Such hybridisation is very rare in the wild, and typically only occurs where European minks are declining. A polecat-mink hybrid has a poorly defined facial mask, yellow fur on the ears, grey-yellow underfur and long, dark brown guard hairs. Fairly large, the males attain the peak sizes known for European polecats (weighing  and measuring  in length), and females are much larger than female European minks (weighing  and measuring  in length). The majority of polecat-mink hybrids have skulls bearing greater similarities to those of polecats than to minks. Hybrids can swim well like minks and burrow for food like polecats. They are very difficult to tame and breed, as males are sterile, though females are fertile. The first captive polecat-mink hybrid was created in 1978 by Soviet zoologist Dr. Dmitry Ternovsky of Novosibirsk. Originally bred for their fur (which was more valuable than that of either parent species), the breeding of these hybrids declined as European mink populations decreased. Studies on the behavioural ecology of free-ranging polecat-mink hybrids in the upper reaches of the Lovat River indicate the hybrids will stray from aquatic habitats more readily than pure minks, and will tolerate both parent species entering their territories, though the hybrid's larger size (especially the male's) may deter intrusion. During the summer period, the diet of wild polecat-mink hybrids is more similar to that of the mink than to the polecat, as they feed predominantly on frogs. During the winter, their diets overlap more with those of polecats, and will eat a larger proportion of rodents than in the summer, though they still rely heavily on frogs and rarely scavenge ungulate carcasses as the polecat does.\n\nPredation\nPredators of the European mink include the European polecat, the American mink, the golden eagle, large owls and the red fox. Red fox numbers have increased greatly in areas where the wolf and Eurasian lynx have been extirpated, as well as areas where modern forestry is practised. As red foxes are known to prey on mustelids, excessive fox predation on the European mink is a possible factor, though it is improbable to have been a factor in Finland, where fox numbers were low during the early 20th century.\n\nReferences\n\nNotes\n\nBibliography\n\nExternal links\n\nPhotos of European Mink\nEuropean Mink: Biology and Conservation\nEuropean mink reintroduction project, ex-situ, in-situ research with Dr. Elisabeth Peters, Mustela lutreola, Germany.\n\nWeasels\nCarnivorans of Europe\nMammals of Russia\nCritically endangered animals\nCritically endangered biota of Europe\nMammals described in 1761\nTaxa named by Carl Linnaeus\nSemiaquatic mammals", "machine_text": "European mink (Mustela lutreola) is a species of mink native to Europe. It is a member of the family Mustelidae and is closely related to the American mink (Mustela vison). The European mink is generally smaller than the American mink and has a more slender and elongated body. The European mink is a carnivorous animal that feeds primarily on fish, although it also takes small mammals, amphibians, and crustaceans. They are largely solitary animals and can be found near rivers and other bodies of water. The European mink is listed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The main threats to its survival are habitat destruction, hunting, and hybridization with the American mink, which has been introduced in many areas of Europe. The European mink is also susceptible to diseases such as Aleutian disease and distemper, which can be transmitted by the American mink. Efforts to conserve the European mink include habitat restoration, captive breeding programs, and the control of the American mink population in areas where they overlap with European minks. In addition, genetic studies have provided further insight into the population structure and genetic diversity of the European mink.

Nowadays it is also used in Buddhist monasteries in India; China, especially in the Tibetan Buddhist areas within the Tibet Autonomous Region, Sichuan, Yunnan, Qinghai and Gansu; Mongolia, and Japan. It is normally written from left to right but the Kutakshar form is written from top to bottom. It is also considered to be the standard Nepali calligraphic script.\n\nDevelopment\nRa\u00f1jan\u0101 is a Brahmic script which developed around 1100 CE. It is used in India and in Nepal by the Newar people to write the Newar language. The script is also used in most of the Mahayana and Vajrayana monasteries. Along with the Prachalit Nepal alphabet, it is considered one of the scripts of Nepal. It is the formal script of Nepal duly registered in the United Nation while applying for the free Nation.

Ra\u00f1jana is also in current use for printing \u201chigh status\u201d documents (wedding invitations, certificates, etc) in Nepal in the Newar language and for Newar language book titles. In Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhist traditions, it is famously used to write various mantras including the \"Om mani padme hum\" mantra of Avalokite\u015bvara, the mantra of Tara: \"Om tare tuttare ture svaha\", and the mantra of Manjusri: \"Om a ra pa ca na dhi.\" The script is also used in Hindu scriptures.\n\nIn Chinese Buddhism and other East Asian Buddhism, the standard Sanskrit script for mantras and dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u012bs was not the Ra\u00f1jan\u0101 script, but rather the earlier Siddha\u1e43 script that was widely propagated in China during the Tang dynasty. However, in late Imperial China, the influence of Tibetan Buddhism popularized the Ra\u00f1jan\u0101 script as well, and so this script is also found throughout East Asia, but is not as common as Siddha\u1e43. In Vietnam, Ra\u00f1jan\u0101 script is often used during Buddhist rituals especially by monks in the central region such as Hu\u1ebf. Talismans are often made using Ra\u00f1jan\u0101 mantras read \"Om mani padme hum\" or \"Om cale cule cundi svaha\"  the mantra of Cundi Bodhisattva. The script has also been adopted by Vietnamese folk shamans in their use of amulets such as L\u1ed7 Ban ph\u00e1i, a Taoist folk sect that arrived from China named after Lu Ban, patron god of carpenters.\n\nUse in Tibet \n\nWhen Ra\u00f1jan\u0101 was introduced to Tibet, it was referred to as Lanydza (), which simply derives from the Sanskrit word Ra\u00f1ja. This script varies slightly from the standard Ra\u00f1jan\u0101. In Tibet, the Lanydza variant is used to write original texts of Sanskrit. Examples of such texts include the Ma\u00f1ju\u015br\u012bn\u0101masamg\u012bti, the Diamond Sutra and the A\u1e63\u1e6das\u0101hasrik\u0101 Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 S\u016btra. The Lanydza script is also found in manuscripts and printed editions of some Sanskrit-Tibetan lexicons like the Mah\u0101vyutpatti.\n\nHowever, the most frequent use for this script today is on the title pages of Tibetan texts, where the Sanskrit title is often written in Lanydza, followed by a transliteration and translation in the Tibetan script. The script is also used decoratively on temple walls, on the outside of prayer wheels, and in the drawing of mandalas.\n\nNumerous alternative spellings of the term Lanydza exist, including the following:\n Lanja\n Landzha\n Lantsa\n Lantsha\n Lentsa\n Lendza\n\nMonogram (Kut\u0101kshar)\n\nKut\u0101kshar is a monogram of the Ranjana script.

The script is characterized by its unique style of writing the letters, which is similar to other Indian scripts such as Devanagari and Brahmi. History The origin of the Ranjana script is unclear, but it is believed to have originated in the Kathmandu Valley of Nepal, where it was used by the Newar community. The script was named after King Rana-Jit Malla, who ruled over Nepal during the 11th century CE. The script gained popularity during the Malla dynasty, which ruled over Nepal during the medieval period. During the Malla dynasty, the Ranjana script was not only used for writing Nepali, but also for writing other languages such as Sanskrit, Tibetan, and Newari. It was also used for writing sacred texts and manuscripts, which were highly respected by the people of Nepal. Usage Today, the Ranjana script is still used by the Newar people of Nepal for religious and cultural purposes. It is used for writing hymns, prayers, and other religious texts that are chanted during festivals and rituals. It is also used for writing Buddhist and Hindu texts, including the Tripitaka and the Mahabharata.

It passed 79 statutes and adopted the Hoyt Code as the basis of the Territory's legal system.\n\nBackground\nThe Indian wars were winding down, with most of Arizona Territory's native population pacified.  Following 1877 there would be periodic outbreaks of violence but no widespread conflict.  The reduction in violence was allowing the economy to boom. Prospectors had found and were developing a number of mineral deposits. Reduced Indian problems had allowed importation of sheep and cattle. Additionally, the Southern Pacific Railroad was being built across the territory.\n\nGovernor Anson P.K. Safford's education initiatives were prospering. A May 1876 census showed at least 1,450 of the territory's 2,955 children were literate.  Territorial school districts were also preparing to issue bonds to replace makeshift classrooms with larger structures better able to handle the growing demand.\n\nThe territorial legal code was in need of updating. To address this need, Territorial Secretary John Philo Hoyt had been commissioned to create a revised code based upon the \"Howell Code\" which was adopted by the 1st Arizona Territorial Legislature.\n\nLegislative session\nThe legislative session began on January 1, 1877.\n\nGovernor's address\nAs with all his previous addresses, Governor Safford discussed the current situation involving the Indian Wars.  To this he added his concerns about outlaws.  Declaring highwaymen \"are a scourge to civilization, a disgrace to humanity, and should be swept from the face of the earth as remorselessly as the most ferocious wild beast\", he recommended highway robbery be made a capital crime.  The governor was able to report that the Yuma Territorial Prison was partially open, holding eight prisoners with a capacity for thirty.\n\nLegislation\nThe ninth session of the Arizona Territorial Legislature was unusually productive, passing 79 new laws.  The revised legal code drafted by the Territorial Secretary, dubbed the \"Hoyt Code\", was adopted as the basis of the territory's legal system.\n\nDespite the previous session's permanently fixing the territorial capital in Tucson, the first action taken by this session was to move the capital to Prescott.  Other organizational changes included adjusting the northern boundary of Maricopa County, moving the seat of Mohave County to Mineral Park, and incorporating the City of Tucson.  In a related activity, residents of Grant County, New Mexico Territory had voiced a desire to have their county annexed to the Arizona Territory.  The legislature responded by petitioning the U.S. Congress to make the requested transfer.\n\nTo help deal with continuing lawlessness, the session authorized payment of a US$300 reward for the capture of two highwaymen who had robbed a stagecoach and its accompanying United States mail near Skull Valley on January 4, 1877.  They also authorized formation of another volunteer force to fight in the Apache Wars.\n\nOther actions included imposition of a US$50 fine on anyone who allowed their hogs to run wild within a town.  Maricopa County was given permission to issue US$15,000 in bonds for a series of four roads radiating from Phoenix: one to Globe City, one to Yuma via Agua Caliente, and two routes to Prescott via Black Canyon and Wickenburg.  Finally, the session granted divorces to ten couples.\n\nMembers\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n \n\n09\n09\n1877 in Arizona Territory\nTerritorial Legislature", "machine_text": "The 9th Arizona Territorial Legislature was convened on January 1, 1889, and ended on March 5, 1889. It was the final legislative session before Arizona became a state, with the convention for the proposed state constitution being held later that year. During the session, the legislature passed several significant bills. One of the most important was the establishment of a university in the territory. This legislation created the University of Arizona, which would eventually become one of the leading research institutions in the Southwest. The 9th Legislative Assembly also grappled with issues of water rights and land use. One bill established a water rights code, while another outlined the requirements for citizens to obtain land patents from the government. There was also some debate about the distribution of land conservation funds. The session was also marked by some controversy. Governor C. Meyer Zulick had a contentious relationship with the legislature, particularly over his veto power. At one point, he attempted to exercise his veto power over a bill that he had already signed into law, leading to a legal battle that went all the way to the Supreme Court. Despite these challenges, the 9th Arizona Territorial Legislature was viewed as overall successful. It created important institutions, clarified land and water use laws, and laid the groundwork for the eventual transition to statehood.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 31486658}

He was born in Manises in 1842, but emigrated to Argentina in 1875, where he led civil engineering projects and took part in hydraulic works in Brazil, the Andes and Patagonia. Besides that, he was involved in the design and planning of La Plata city and the port of La Campana, which he also built. On July 14th, 1889, he left Argentina with his enormous paleontological collection aboard the ship Mateo Bruzzo, arriving at the port of Barcelona in the midst of great expectation. A special train was chartered to transport the valuable collection to Valencia, arriving the evening of August 9th.\nThe collection is made up of a large number of mammal fossils belonging to the South American Quaternary, including a human skeleton called Samboromb\u00f3n considered to be the star of the collection. It was the focus of a great amount of scientific discussions in the early 20th century due to the postulate of the tertiary antiquity of the origin of mankind. \nHe was accompanied by Enrique De Carles, the main fossil collector and naturalist technician of the Museum of Buenos Aires. He was the main person in charge of the mounting of the skeletons until his early departure in June 1890, when the city of Valencia suffered the last cholera outbreak. \nIt was this year when the collection was moved from the San Gregorio's Convent to a municipal property located at number 62 of Ruzafa Street, where it remained temporarily until 1896. The collection was placed in an old Jesuit building, the San Pablo's Hospital, next to the Alquer\u00eda de Juli\u00e0, far from the historical center.\n\nIn 1904, Jos\u00e9 Rodrigo Botet, the main donor of the museum's collection, died in Madrid. Eduardo Bosc\u00e1 Casanoves (1843\u20131924), senior gardener of the Botanical Garden of the University of Valencia, with firm evolutionary beliefs, becomes the first director of the Municipal Museum of Paleontology, and together with the exhibition fitter Carlos Maicas, they continued the work with the skeletons that Enrique de Carles started.\nWith the celebration of the IV Centenary of the University of Valencia in 1902, the City Council of Valencia decided to exhibit the collection to the general public for the first time. San Pablo's Hospital building turned out to be inefficient for the conservation and exhibition of the collection. For this reason, the City Council of Valencia proposed the execution of a new building that would be located in Pla del Real (Llano del Real in Spanish) whose purpose would be Botet's collection to exhibit it to the public. The new building, which was planned to be named as the Valencian Palace of Natural Sciences, never was built due to lack of funding. Instead, the collection was deposited in a new location at Almod\u00ed building (Almud\u00edn in Spanish), an old 14th century corn exchange located in the heart of the historic district of Valencia \u2014 just a few meters from the Cathedral and which currently has an exhibition hall.\nThe new location allowed the paleontological collection to be visited by the general public, opening in 1908 as the Municipal Museum of Paleontology. In 1924 Eduardo Bosc\u00e1 Casanoves, first director of the museum, and one of the greatest advocates of the social broadcasting of Botet's paleontological collection, died. That same year he was succeeded by Don Francisco Beltr\u00e1n Bigorra, who expanded the museum's collections with an enormous malacological collection donated by Eduardo Rosell\u00f3 Bru in 1925.\nFor the following decades, the museum remained open to the public at this location, so that the Almud\u00edn building became a synonym of Paleontology Museum, until torrential rains in 1989 accelerated the deterioration of the building, which was declared dilapidated. Authorities evicted the collection in the face of the danger of collapse, without a precedent in Europe of a transfer of that magnitude since the Second World War.\nThe collection was moved to the ground floor of the town hall, in the old Municipal Exhibition Hall, and first opened on 2 July 1991. During 1996, the City Council approved a rehabilitation project for the old Viveros restaurant and the creation of the Natural Science Museum that would host the collection of the Museum of Paleontology. To boost the didactic value of the collections, a project that respected the most current museographic tendencies was developed. In 1999 the current Museum of Natural Sciences of Valencia was opened \u2014 at the same location where the City Council projected the construction of the Valencian Palace of Natural Sciences at the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nBuilding \nThe rationalist building, which the Museum of Natural Sciences currently takes in, corresponds to the former luxury restaurant Restaurante Viveros. This building was built in the late 1950s, and was designed by the Valencian architect Luis Gay, whose work was influenced by the architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, precursor of the Bauhaus. The building is considered a unique building and has a grade 2 listed building\n\nCollections \n\nRodrigo Botet's collection is possibly the best European collection of fossils from the South American Pleistocene, consisting of twenty skeletons and more than five thousand bones belonging to more than twenty different mammal families.\n\nMuseum galleries \n\n Science and Technology: This room is dedicated to the history of science and contains the first electronic microscope of Valencia, acquired in 1966 by the Institute of Cytological Research, now the Valencian Foundation for Biomedical Research. The recreation of a scientific cabinet of the 19th century, similar to that of Santiago Ram\u00f3n y Cajal, stands out.\n Biodiversity: A room for the description and dissemination of Valencian biodiversity. It includes a virtual visit to the natural spaces of El Saler and La Devesa.\n Origin of Life: Paleozoic.\n Rodrigo Botet Paleontological Collection: In this room, where the Rodrigo Botet collection is exhibited, is the most representative and spectacular example of the museum, a complete skeleton of a six-meter-long Megatherium. We can also find in this room the skeletons of a great bear, a saber-toothed tiger (Smilodon ensenadensis) and several giant armadillos, among which the most outstanding ones are an Eutatus seguini, a Neosclerocalyptus and a Glyptodon clavipes. The specimens from Rodrigo Botet's collection are mentioned by Charles R. Darwin in his work the Origin of Species, which made the collection highly sought after by prestigious European museums of the time.\n Mesozoic and Cenozoic\n Dinosaurs of the Valencian Community\n Sites of the Valencian continental Neogene: In the museum we can find the skull of a 5 million year old sirenia found in Pilar de la Horadada (Alicante), belonging to the genus Metaxitherium, the group of the current dugongs.\n Malacology: A part of the collection donated in 1925 by Eduardo Rosell\u00f3 Bru is exhibited in this room.\n Ecosystems and city birds\n Beekeeping\n Temporary exhibitions\n\nAreas \nIt consists of four distinct areas:\n\n The Valencian contribution to Natural Sciences.\n The History of life, a journey through the different eras into which the age of the Earth is usually divided. Also on display in this area is the Museum's most important paleontological collection, which is the legacy of J. Rodrigo Botet, a fabulous example of Quaternary paleontology from South America. Of particular importance is the specimen of Megaterio, an emblematic piece of the Museum;\n Malacology, an interesting collection of mollusk shells, which is a complete representation of the malacological fauna of the Valencian Community.\n Valencian ecosystems.\nThe municipality of Valencia has great wealth and variety of ecosystems. It is very difficult to find in the same space, a city of almost a million inhabitants, a riverbank ecosystem, the sea, a vegetable garden with high agricultural productivity and the nuclei of greatest naturalistic value of the Parc Natural de l'Albufera de Val\u00e8ncia (Valencian Albufera Nature Park), such as the Albufera and the Devesa.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\nMuseums in Valencia\nCultural tourism in Spain\nNatural history museums in Spain\nFossil museums\nMuseums established in 1889", "machine_text": "The Natural Science Museum of Valencia is a museum located in the city of Valencia, Spain.

This interpretation typically including dress shirt, necktie, and trousers, but worn with an odd-coloured blazer or a sports coat instead.\n\nAcceptance of business casual in the United States was preceded by Casual Fridays which originated in California in the 1990s, in turn inspired by the Hawaiian 1960s casual custom of Aloha Friday. The designation of particular clothing pieces as \"business casual\" may be contentious.\n\nDefinition\nThere is no generally agreed definition of \"business casual\".  One definition of business casual states that it includes khaki pants, slacks, and skirts, as well as short-sleeved polo shirts  and long-sleeved shirts, but excludes jeans, tight or short skirts, T-shirts, and sweatshirts. Another source, an American university careers service, states that business casual consists of neutral colors more towards the dark shades of black, gray, navy, but can include white and off white, and reminds that the clothing should be pressed and have clean, crisp seams. The \"Dress for Success\" advice from the University of Toronto sums up business casual as \"a classic, clean cut, and put together look where a full suit is not required,\" which means slacks, khakis, or skirts; blouses, polo shirts, or shirts with collar but no necktie; some sweaters; and closed-toe shoes. The Canadian university ends with the warning that \"it is not clothing you would wear to a club or for athletic purposes.... Don\u2019t let the word casual mislead you. You still need to look professional.\"\n\nAnother author wrote in the Financial Times that \"Ordinarily business casual for guys seems fairly clear. It is a pair of chinos, a blazer and a good shirt, no tie.\" \n\nA writer wrote in a workwear Blog that \"Business casual attire for also men consists of dress pants, dockers-type pants, khakis and a shirt. They also wear a golf-type shirt instead of a traditional shirt, and they wear sweaters or vests on top of the shirt. Women\u2019s choose to wear pants or skirts with a top or blouses paired with a sweater.\"\n\nA BBC article suggested that a \"safe global standard\" consists of \"a button down shirt,\" \"jackets or blazers, khaki or gray slacks, and leather shoes.\" It warned, however, that great variation exists between countries and regions within countries. A U.S. menswear retailer advises men to wear a collared shirt, chinos, navy blazer, and brown shoes, while making sure to look \"clean and well-groomed.\"\n\nA contributor to Forbes asked her Facebook friends to define business casual, and found a slightly more casual apparent consensus not forcibly including a jacket: \"For men: trousers/khakis and a shirt with a collar. For women: trousers/knee-length skirt and a blouse or shirt with a collar. No jeans. No athletic wear.\" A response to that was \"I disagree. No khakis.\" She states that \"there\u2019s a lack of consensus in what actually defines a business casual wardrobe.

This dress code sits in between the formal dress code and the casual dress code. It is meant to provide a comfortable and relaxed dress code for employees without compromising the professional image of the company. Business casual dress code varies from office to office and from industry to industry. The components of business casual attire for men include dress slacks, khakis, polo shirts, button-down shirts, collared shirts, sweaters, blazers, loafers, and dress shoes. Men can mix, match and combine the outfits with different color combinations and patterns, but should aim to maintain a sophisticated and polished look. For women, business casual comprises skirts, dresses, blouses, slacks, trousers, sweaters, and dress shoes. It is essential to avoid any form of clothing that is too low-cut, tight-fitting, short, or revealing. Women can use accessories like scarfs, jewelry, and handbags to vary their outfit and personalize their look, as long as they remain professional. The term \"business casual\" is believed to have originated in the 1990s when employers and employees began looking for a more relaxed dress code. The dress code has since become widespread and has gained popularity in modern offices. Companies have adopted different policies and have defined their unique business casual requirements to suit their culture and brand. Business casual attire has several benefits, including boosting employee morale and wellbeing by allowing them to feel comfortable in their clothing, enhancing the team spirit in the organization, reducing the cost of buying expensive formal wear, and creating a relaxed environment that encourages creativity and productivity.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Apologeticus\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Apologeticus ( or Apologeticus) is a text attributed to Tertullian, consisting of apologetic and polemic. In this work Tertullian defends Christianity, demanding legal toleration and that Christians be treated as all other sects of the Roman Empire. It is in this treatise that one finds the sentence \"Plures efficimur, quotiens metimur a vobis: semen est sanguis Christianorum.\" which has been liberally and apocryphally translated as \"the blood of the martyrs is the seed of the Church\" (Apologeticus, L.13). Alexander Souter translated this phrase as \"We spring up in greater numbers the more we are mown down by you: the blood of the Christians is the seed of a new life,\" but even this takes liberties with the original text. \"We multiply when you reap us. The blood of Christians is seed,\" is perhaps a more faithful, if less poetic, rendering. \n\nThere is a similarity of content, if not of purpose, between this work and Tertullian's Ad nationes\u2014published earlier in the same year\u2014and it has been claimed that the latter is a finished draft of Apologeticus. There arises also the question of similarity to Minucius Felix's dialogue Octavius. Some paragraphs are shared by both texts; it is not known which predated the other.\n\nTertullian's brief De testimonio animae (\"Concerning the Evidences of the Soul\") is an appendix to the Apologeticus, intended to illustrate the meaning of the phrase testimonium animae naturaliter christianae in chapter  17).\n\nAuthorship\nNot much is known about the life of Quintus Septimus Florens Tertullian. Some scholars believe him to have been a presbyter (priest) of the Christian Church, the son of a Roman centurion, and have him training to be a lawyer in Rome. Others, like David Wright, find that to be highly improbable. \"No firm evidence places him in Rome at all, or for that matter anywhere outside of Carthage\u2026 It is in the well-educated circles in Carthage,\" Wright argues, \"that Tertullian most securely belongs\". Sometime after his conversion to the Christian faith, Tertullian left the Catholic Church in favor of the Montanist movement, which he remained a part of for at least 10\u201315 years of his active life and whose influence can be seen in many of his later works.\n\nAscribed date\nApologeticus, his most famous apologetic work, was written in Carthage in the summer or autumn of AD 197, during the reign of :Septimius Severus. Using this date, most scholars agree that Tertullian's conversion to Christianity occurred sometime before 197, possibly around 195. It was written before the edict of Septimius Severus (AD 202), and consequently, the laws to which Tertullian took exception were those under which the Christians of the 1st and 2nd centuries had been convicted.\n\nOldest extant manuscripts\n\"The present treatise depends on three authorities, none of them comprising the entire work. The first printed edition, by Martin Mesnart at Paris in 1545, containing chapters 1-19, was made from a manuscript now lost, but which seems to have been a copy of the already mutilated original of the eleventh-century codex Agobardinus (now at Paris). This, our oldest extant authority, contains a number of Tertullian's works, and of the present treatise chapters 1-30; in the first sentence of chapter 21 the copyist, following his original, which had lost a number of pages, passed on (without apparently noticing any discrepancy) to the middle of a sentence near the beginning of a different work On The Dress of Women.\"\n\n\"The study of the manuscripts of Tert. has established that in the Middle Ages several collection of works of this author were in existence1:\n1. The collection of the Codex Agobardinus, the oldest extant manuscript of Tert.2.\n2. The collection of the manuscript of Troyes 523 (Codex Trecensis) of the twelfth century3.\n3. A collection represented by a number of manuscripts, which derive from a lost Codex Cluniacensis and a likewise lost manuscript from Hirsau (W\u00fcrttemberg), the Hirsaugiensis4.\n\nAddressees and audience\nThis work is ostensibly addressed to the provincial governors of the Roman Empire, more specifically the magistrates of Carthage- \"that the truth, being forbidden to defend itself publicly, may reach the ears of the rulers by the hidden path of letters\"\u2014 and thus bears resemblance to the Greek apologues. It is structured as an appeal on behalf of the Christians and pleads \"for toleration of Christianity, attacking pagan superstition, rebutting charges against Christian morality, and claiming that Christians are no danger to the State but useful citizens\". Its readership is likely to have been composed of Christians, whose faith was reinforced through Tertullian's defense against rationalizations and rumours and who  \"would have been hugely enheartened by Tertullian\u2019s matchless confidence in the superiority of the Christian religion\".\n\nGenre\nApologeticus has the typical concerns of other apologetic works of his time, though it is presented in a much more complex manner. According to Wright, the text is constantly shifting \"from the philosophical mode to the rhetorical and even juridical\". Drawing from his training in literature and law, Tertullian demonstrates his talents as a Latinist and a rhetorician in an attempt to defend his newfound Christian faith. Tertullian's modern editor :Otto Bardenhewer further contends that Apologeticus is calm in tone, \"a model of judicial discussion\". Unlike previous apologists of Christianity, whose appeals for tolerance were made in the name of reason and humanity, Tertullian, influenced by his legal training, spoke as a jurist convinced of the injustice of the laws under which the Christians were persecuted.\n\nSummary of Apologeticus\nThe following outline and summary is based on Robert D. Sider's translation of Apologeticus.\n\nIntroduction and addressing of unjust treatment of the Christians (Chapters 1\u20136)\nThe first section of Apology is concerned with the unjust treatment of the Christians, which Tertullian believes stems from the ignorance of the pagan populace. Simply put, he argues that people praise what they know and hate what they do not. To Tertullian this becomes evident in the cases of people who once hated because they were ignorant towards that they hated, and once their ignorance was gone, so was their hate. Their hatred prevents them from investigating more closely and acknowledging the goodness that is inherent in Christianity, and so they remain ignorant. And there is good in Christianity, Tertullian claims, despite the fact that people remain ignorant to it. Even when brought forth and accused, true Christians do not tremble with fear or deny their faith. It is the authorities that display bad behavior when they deny proper criminal treatment to the Christians. He argues that if Christians are to be treated as criminals, they should not be treated differently from ordinary criminals, who are free to answer to charges, to cross-question and defend themselves. In reality, the Christians are not free to say anything that will clear their name or ensure that the judge conducts a fair trial. If an individual says he is not a Christian, he is tortured until he says he is; if he admits to being a Christian, the authorities want to hear that he is not and torture him until he denies it. They resort to any means necessary to force them to either deny or confess, anything to acquit him. If all this done to someone simply for admitting to be a Christian, then they are surely making a mockery of Roman laws by basing all the charges on the name \"Christian\". Before hating the name, one must look at and study the founder and the school.\n\nIn addressing the charges, Tertullian plans to show the hypocrisy that surrounds these charges, demonstrating that those crimes exist among the pagan prosecutors as well. Then he analyzes the laws, claiming it suspicious that a law should refuse to be examined for error and worthless if it demands obedience without examination. If a law is found having an error and being unjust, should it not be reformed or even condemned? Faulty laws have no place in a just judicial system and should thus not be applied and observed. Here Tertullian mentions :Nero, and to a certain extent :Domitian, as examples of emperors who raged against the Christians through the use of unjust laws, simply for condemning \"some magnificent good\". He then brings up the good laws, and asks what has become of them; those that \"restrained extravagance and bribery\", \"protected their [women's] modesty and sobriety\", of the \"conjugal happiness so fostered by high moral living that for nearly six hundred years after Rome was founded no sued for divorce\". These traditions and laws are being ignored, neglected and destroyed and yet Rome chooses to concern itself with the \"crimes\" committed by the Christians.\n\nCharges based on rumor answered (Chapters 7\u20139)\nTertullian begins by addressing the charges based on rumors, charges that vary from murdering and eating babies to committing incestuous and adulterous acts. Ultimately, he argues, they are simply rumors, for no evidence has ever been brought forth. No one has ever seen believers gather and supposedly commit impure acts or heard the cry of a crying baby because meetings and rituals are rarely performed in front of non-believers. It's all just lies and rumors meant to slander the Christian faith. Tertullian then makes the claim that Romans themselves are guilty of the very crimes it claims the Christians do. People from every age are sacrificed to Saturn and Jupiter all throughout the empire. The arenas are filled with the blood of those that fight, and the Romans even consume the animals that eat the bloodied bodies of the dead. For the Christians, murder is strictly forbidden; there is to be no killing or spilling of human blood, and that includes the killing the baby in the womb, for it would be destroying its soul. Neither are Christians allowed to eat meat that still has blood. \n\nOf the charges of incest and adultery, Tertullian says that Christians are not guilty of them, for they refrain from adultery and from fornicating before marriage, thus ensuring that they are safe from incest. Such behavior is different from that of the Romans, who through their immoral acts commit incest. This comes about simply through the case of mistaken identity: men go off and commit adultery, begetting children all throughout the empire who later unknowingly have intercourse with their own kin by mistake. In his attempt to make the Romans acknowledge their engagement in these acts, Tertullian hopes to demonstrate that Christians behave much differently from what they are accused of and that the charges should not hold.\n\nCharges of more \"manifest crimes\" answered (Chapters 10\u201345)\n\nOf the more \"manifest crimes\", as Tertullian refers to them, he first addresses the charges of sacrilege and says that Christians do not worship the pagan gods because the gods are not real, do not exist and thus hold no power or control over anything. Saturn, he claims, was once a mere man, as Roman lore and history will demonstrate. He then refutes further claims that the gods received their divinity through death, and wonders what business would the gods have with wanting ministers and assistants that are already dead. Such powerless beings cannot even be responsible for the rise and success of the Roman Empire. Furthermore, the character and nature of the gods themselves leave much to be desired; they are filled with rage, incestuous thoughts, envy, and jealousy. Why then should such imperfect and wicked beings be worthy of praise? He makes an even greater argument in referring to the pagan gods as demons, whose sole purpose is the subversion and destruction of mankind. They corrupt the souls of men by passions and lusts and rather successfully procuring \"for themselves a proper diet of fumes and blood offered to their statues' images.\" In this way they draw attention to themselves and prevent people from turning to the true God. But even the demons acknowledge the power of God, and acknowledging this should be enough to clear the Christians of charges of sacrilege. For Tertullian, the Romans are at fault here for worshipping the wrong religion, not that of the one true God. But if the gods are real, and if the Christians are guilty of sacrilege, what does that say about Rome? The people all worship different gods and often treat their images with less respect than they deserve, using any opportunity to pawn their statues off and use them as sources of income. Tertullian further criticizes their literature, practices and ceremonies, calling them absurd and criticizing their philosophers\u2019 disgraceful actions. Socrates would swear by dogs and Diogenes and Varro made less than respectful comments concerning the deities. The plays constantly make jokes about and mockery of the gods. Surely, he argues, the plays and the masks must be disrespectful to the gods. It is the Romans then that are guilty of sacrilege and impiety. \n\nChristians do not venerate these false and dead gods, nor do they treat them in such a casual and careless manner. They worship the One God, the Creator of the universe. Unlike the pagan gods, He is real and His very existence is proven by the testimony of the soul, which cries out \"God\" despite its weakened and fallen state. His works and the works of his prophets are preserved from Moses, who was 1000 years before the Trojan War and predates both Saturn and much of ancient Roman literature tradition, to many others key biblical figures. Tertullian goes on to briefly discuss the revelation of God through Christ. In order to do that, he speaks of the relationship between the Jewish people and God; they once enjoyed much favor from God but became \"so filled with presumptuous confidence in their ancestors that they strayed from their teaching into manners of the world\". Christ comes to re-establish the true doctrine; He is embodiment of Word and Reason, having been brought forth by God and thus having the title of Son of God. He adds, \"his ray of God, then, was ever foretold in the past descended into a certain virgin and, formed as flesh in her womb, and was born man mingled (later changed to \u2018united\u2019) with God\". Having given an explanation of the nature and divinity of Christ, Tertullian shifts to the charges of treason.  \n\nTo the charges that Christians do not offer sacrifice to Caesar, Tertullian says that it is practically useless to do that, for it is not in their power to give Caesar health, wealth and power. What they can offer to him they do through the use of prayer, because only God has absolute power and from him comes the emperor. He alone brings up empires and takes them down and only he is responsible for granting Caesar power, health and wealth; \"We ask for them [emperors] a long life, undisturbed power, security at home, brave armies, a faithful Senate, an upright people, a peaceful world, and everything for which a man or a Caesar prays\". Tertullian affirms that by praying for him, Christians are effectively putting Roman interests in God's hands as well as commending Caesar to God. In no way do their meetings endanger the state, nor do they involve plotting against the emperor, the senate, or the empire. Their treatment of the Roman Empire exhibits the same respect and well wishes that they display upon to their neighbor. Any other behavior would not be the sign of a good Christian.\n\nTertullian has addressed the charges and demonstrated that the charges faced by Christians are based on lies and rumors and that no such things have been committed. After all he has demonstrated, Tertullian marvels at how the pagan prosecutors still claim that being a Christian is a crime against the empire. Christianity in general presents no threat to public order and thus its members should be allowed to meet and live in peace.\n\nPortrait of Christian society and of philosophy (Chapters 39\u201347)\nTertullian then proceeds to give an explanation of Christian life and practices. He describes the manner in which they come together to worship and please God; to pray for each other as well as for the emperor and the empire, to study and consider the Holy Scriptures, and to share food\u2014but not before offering prayers and thanks to God. Afterwards everyone is free to share a song or something they learned from scripture, praising God all throughout the night. He continues by explaining the practice of tithing, the concept of loving one another and of being brothers and sisters, being united by their way of life under the teachings of Christ. And being part of this world, Christians have to interact with it and with others. They shop at meat markets and local shops, go to the baths and stay at inns just like everyone else, though in everything they do, they \"bear in mind that we owe thanks to the Lord our God who created us\". Despite this, the persecutors and accusers fail to recognize innocence when they see it, persecuting and treating the Christians unjustly. Christians know true innocence because they have learned and inherited it from God; they recognize and understand the eternal punishment that exists apart from God and acknowledge and fear the one who passes that real and true Judgment. Tertullian declares, \"in a word, we fear God, not the proconsul\". He also addresses the claim that Christianity is more than a philosophy, bringing up the philosophers that say, \"it [Christianity] teaches the virtues and profess morality, justice, patience, moderation, and chastity\". He makes the case that if Christianity is just another kind of philosophy, it should be treated the same way, granted with the freedom to teach and spread their beliefs and practice, customs and rituals.\n\nConcluding considerations and remarks\nTertullian concludes his apology by likening the struggle of the Christians to a man fighting a battle. The Christians take no pleasure in being persecuted and enduring trials, but as soldiers of Christ they too must fight for the truth, all, of course, for the glory of God. Addressing the magistrates, he says \"Crucify us- torture us- condemn us- destroy us! Your injustice is the proof of our innocence... When we are condemned by you, we are acquitted by God\".\n\nSee also\n Religio licita, a phrase found only in the Apologeticus to describe the special status of Judaism under Roman rule\n\nNotes\n\nReferences \nWright, David & Philip F.

This type of writing originated in ancient Greece and Rome, but it has continued to be used throughout history to defend various causes or beliefs in both religious and secular contexts. One of the most famous Apologeticus works in history is the \"Apology\" by Plato, which presents a defense of Socrates' philosophy and conduct in the face of accusations of impiety and corrupting the youth of Athens. Similarly, the early Christian church produced a number of Apologeticus texts in response to accusations of heresy and persecution by the Roman Empire. In the modern era, Apologeticus literature has continued to be used by various groups and individuals to defend their beliefs and actions. For example, modern apologists often present a defense of Christianity and its teachings, particularly in response to criticism from atheists and secularists. Apologeticus writing can take many forms, including essays, speeches, and books. Some notable examples from history include St. Augustine's \"City of God,\" which defends Christianity against accusations of causing the fall of Rome, and Thomas Aquinas' \"Summa Theologica,\" which provides a systematic defense of Catholic theology. One of the key features of Apologeticus writing is the use of logic and rhetoric to make a persuasive case for a particular belief or action. Apologists employ a variety of techniques, including historical evidence, philosophical argumentation, and personal testimony, to make their case. In conclusion, Apologeticus literature has a long and rich history, spanning cultures and beliefs.

With over 15,000 casualties, it was one of the bloodiest battles of the invasion.\n\nPrelude\n\nVitebsk operation\nThe Russian First Western Army under General Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly slipped away from Vitebsk on 27 July after an inconclusive fight against Emperor Napoleon, avoiding a general engagement. Napoleon was frustrated by his inability to bring the Russian army to battle and lingered at Vitebsk until 12 August to reform his Grande Arm\u00e9e and wait for stragglers to catch up. General Jean-Andoche Junot replaced King J\u00e9r\u00f4me as commander of the Westphalian VIII Corps and the Corps joined Napoleon's main army on 4 August near Orsha.\n\nFrench situation\nAfter five weeks of non-stop operations, the main 375,000-man strike force available to Napoleon had been reduced to 185,000 men by a host of factors. 90,000 troops under Marshal Nicolas Oudinot and Generals Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr, Jean Reynier and Victor de Fay de La Tour-Maubourg had been detached for various missions. Russian forces had inflicted thousands of combat losses on Napoleon's main army, but the primary cause in the reduction of his force was strategic consumption\u2014the need to garrison cities, towns, fortresses and forward supply depots.\n\nRapid forced marches and the inability of supply wagon trains led to high incidences of desertion and tens of thousands of losses to hunger and disease, most notably dysentery. The scorching July heat reduced the availability of water supplies. Huge numbers of cavalry horses and transportation horses and oxen had died due to a lack of grazing areas and the inability of the wagons to carry enough fodder.\n\nRussian plan\n\nThe loss of vast stretches of Russian territory to the advancing French led to a crisis and shift in power in the Russian high command. An aggressive \"Russian\" faction around Prince Pyotr Bagration called for an immediate, all-out attack against Napoleon. They were supported by Czar Alexander I and the bulk of the officer corps. The \"foreign\" faction around Barclay de Tolly, composed mostly of officers of German extraction, advocated the continuation of the present policy of delay and withdrawal to dilute Napoleon's striking power. Under strong pressure from above and below, including threats of force, Barclay agreed to an offensive on 6 August. Ignorant as to French dispositions, Barclay intended to outflank what he presumed to be the isolated corps of Viceroy Eug\u00e8ne de Beauharnais near Rudnia, destroy it, and inflict further losses on the French as they came to Eug\u00e9ne's aid.\n\nBarclay advanced on Rudnia and Poryeche on 7 August.Count Matvei Platov's Cossacks imposed a sharp defeat on General Horace S\u00e9bastiani's cavalry near Inkovo the same day, inflicting 600 French casualties. On 8 August, Barclay received false intelligence that Eug\u00e8ne's corps was at Poryeche and reoriented half of his army to face north. Platov was directed to rejoin Barclay's army and Bagration was to move to Vidra. Bagration disobeyed his orders, fearing French Marshal Louis-Nicolas Davout's threat to his left flank. He declared his army was hungry and sick and moved to Smolensk. Barclay failed to stop him, merely adjusting his own forces to compensate. On 11 August, Barclay stayed put and engaged only in outpost fighting with French cavalry under Neapolitan King Joachim. On 12 August, Barclay's scouts found Poryeche empty and he directed Platov to reconnoiter the French movements. The Russian offensive had failed due to disagreements among the generals, Barclay's inactivity and pointless marches that lost the Russians time they could not recover.\n\nFrench plan\n\nNapoleon had expected a Russian offensive and saw in it a great opportunity to envelop and annihilate the Russian army. He directed Marshal Jacques MacDonald to cross the Daugava to help out Oudinot's force and ordered Oudinot and Saint-Cyr to attack Prince Peter Wittgenstein's 20,000-strong corps to prevent it from assisting Barclay. Napoleon came up with what became known as the Smolensk maneuver, a masterful operation designed to outflank Barclay from the south, cut off the Russians from Moscow and destroy the isolated Russian army, thus bringing the war to an end.\n\nThe action at Inkovo on 7 August was seen by Napoleon as heralding an immediate Russian attack. Worried, he deployed his army in a defensive posture around III Corps. By 10 August, Barclay's glacial slowness of operations had convinced Napoleon that the threat had passed. He proceeded with his maneuver. Vitebsk was garrisoned with a force of 3,800 men, which later grew to 7,000, to protect the French lines of communications. Napoleon did not know Barclay's exact location and was acting on instinct. The Grande Arm\u00e9e would advance in two huge columns commanded by Napoleon and Davout. Napoleon's column consisted of Joachim Murat's cavalry, the Imperial Guard, III Corps and IV Corps. It would cross the Dnieper at Rosasna. Davout's column would cross at Orsha, composed of I Corps, V Corps and VIII Corps. This giant force would advance east along the left bank of the Dnieper, swing north to cut the Smolensk-Moscow road and annihilate the isolated Russians. Latour-Maubourg's cavalry would attack down the Dnieper as a diversion. Napoleon's deployment remained hidden from the Russians due to a thick cavalry screen under Generals Emmanuel de Grouchy, \u00c9tienne de Nansouty and Louis-Pierre Montbrun. French engineers under General Jean Baptiste Ebl\u00e9 erected four pontoon bridges across the Dnieper near Rosasna on the night of 13\u201314 August and by daybreak the 175,000-strong Grande Arm\u00e9e was advancing rapidly toward Smolensk.\n\nBattle of Krasnoy\nBarclay had left Generalmajor Neverovski's 27th Division to guard Krasnoy, along with some cavalry and artillery. This force of 5,500\u20137,200 infantry, 1,500 cavalry and 10\u201314 guns was attacked by 20,000 Frenchmen under Murat and Marshal Michel Ney beginning around 2:30 PM on 14 August. Murat's and Ney's inability to coordinate their infantry-cavalry operations allowed the Russians to get away, at the cost of 1,500\u20132,300 Russian men and seven guns as well as 500 French casualties. The French had multiple excellent chances to annihilate the Russians but failed to so.\nNeverovski retreated into Smolensk, shutting the gates behind him. The French inability to capture to the city on the fly imposed a disastrous delay on their operations. Neverovski requested reinforcements from Bagration and received Nikolai Raevsky's VII Corps, which arrived on the morning of 15 August to defend the southern bank of the Dnieper near Smolensk.\n\nBarclay learned of the French attack from Neverovski. He interpreted Napoleon's offensive as a retreat and prepared to capture Vitebsk. He ordered Bagration to move south along the Dnieper. Bagration refused, pointing out that Smolensk, Neverovski and Raevsky were in grave danger. He then received permission from Barclay to deploy to the Dnieper's southern bank at Katan. Barclay ordered General Dmitry Dokhturov's corps to join Bagration and directed the Smolensk governor to evacuate the city archives. No decisive action was undertaken by Barclay due to uncertainty about Napoleon's locations. Czar Alexander left the army and turned over command of the armies to Barclay, ordering him to defend Smolensk. Barclay decided to rush his and Bagration's men down the road from Vitebsk to Smolensk. With his entire plan of operations hanging in the balance, Napoleon failed to act with sufficient vigor and ordered a 24-hour halt to the advance instead.\n\nBattle\n\nSmolensk, a historic fortress city of 12,600 inhabitants on the main Western invasion route to Moscow, was defended by bastion towers and a thick stone wall. The River Dnieper ran through the middle. The Assumption Cathedral in Smolensk housed one of the most venerated icons of the Eastern Orthodox Church, Our Lady of Smolensk attributed to St Luke, and Napoleon assumed that the Russians would fight outside the city to avoid its destruction. By 16 August, French forces found the city heavily garrisoned by Bagration's troops, further reinforced with the subsequent arrival of Barclay and the main Russian army.\n\nThe main battle was fought on 16 August. An initial probing force captured two suburbs but failed to bring the Russians out to battle. Napoleon ordered a general assault with three corps of the Grande Arm\u00e9e, supported by two hundred artillery pieces. This was initially successful, the intense artillery bombardment setting the city on fire. French forces lacked ladders or climbing apparatus to scale the city walls and were under counter fire from Russian artillery. By nightfall, most of the city was burning.\n\nTo save the army, Barclay de Tolly abandoned the city destroying all ammunition stores and bridges leaving a small force to hold out for two days to cover his retreat. Around dawn on 17 August, Grande Arm\u00e9e Polish forces successfully breached the walls, and in a few hours the main French forces entered the city. Barclay retained forces on the other side of the river preventing a crossing until the night of August the 18th. The city was almost completely destroyed.\n\nCasualties\nBarclay de Tolly claimed 4,000 Russian casualties, while Bogdanovich spoke of 6,000 . Docturov's VI Corps had 16,800 men available prior to the battle but only 6,000 capable of combat at its end, which would mean 10,800 casualties for one Russian corps alone. Prince Eugen of W\u00fcrttemberg's division lost 1,300 men alone. Gaston Bodart gave 6,000. whilst David Chandler estimates them as 12,000\u201314,000. Alexander Mikaberidze suggests 10,000 Russian casualties at Smolensk.\n\nNapoleon claimed 700 French killed and 3,100\u20133,200 wounded. His estimate is disputed, as I Corps alone under Lobau lost 6,000. Chandler puts French losses at 10,000, while Mikaberidze also suggested 10,000. Bodart listed 10,000. Russian authors claimed the French losses were as high as 20,000.\n\nLegacy\nThe Battle of Smolensk is commemorated on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Warsaw, with the inscription \"SMOLENSK 17 VIII 1812\".\n\nSee also\nNapoleon's invasion of Russia\nBattle of Smolensk (1941)\nJean-Victor Poncelet\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nConflicts in 1812\nBattles of the Napoleonic Wars\nBattles involving Russia\n1812 in the Russian Empire\nSmolensk\nAugust 1812 events\nBattles of the French invasion of Russia\nSmolensk Governorate\nBattles inscribed on the Arc de Triomphe", "machine_text": "The Battle of Smolensk occurred on August 17th - 18th, 1812, during the Napoleonic Wars. It was a significant conflict between French and Russian forces, and it marked the commencement of Napoleon's disastrous invasion of Russia. The French army, with over 250,000 troops, led by Napoleon Bonaparte, was attempting to conquer Russia. However, they met fierce resistance from the Russian troops under Marshal Barclay de Tolly and General Bagration. The battle took place outside the city of Smolensk, which was strategically important for both sides, as it was a junction point for several roads leading to Moscow. After a day of intense fighting, the French were able to force the Russian army to abandon Smolensk and retreat. However, the victory came at a steep price. The French suffered losses of around 10,000 soldiers, including several key generals, while the Russians lost around 12,000 soldiers. Despite their victory, the French army was unable to pursue the retreating Russians or capture Moscow. The Russian forces employed a scorched earth policy, destroying everything in their path, making it impossible for the French army to resupply. The French army was weakened by the lack of food and supplies, and was further ravaged by the harsh winter weather. The Battle of Smolensk was a pivotal moment in the Napoleonic Wars, marking the beginning of the end for Napoleon's reign. The French army was never able to fully recover from the losses they suffered in the battle, and the failed invasion of Russia ultimately led to Napoleon's downfall. Today, the Battle of Smolensk is commemorated as a significant event in Russian military history. It serves as a reminder of the formidable resistance that Russian soldiers put up against foreign invasions.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 867767}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Shruti (music)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Shruti or \u015bruti is a Sanskrit word, found in the Vedic texts of Hinduism where it means lyrics and \"what is heard\" in general. It is also an important concept in Indian music, where it means the smallest interval of pitch that the human ear can detect and a singer or musical instrument can produce and do nyaas(stay) on it. The musical shruti concept is found in ancient and medieval Sanskrit texts such as the Natya Shastra, the Dattilam, the Brihaddeshi, and the Sangita Ratnakara. Chandogya Upanishad speaks of the division of the octave in 22 parts.\n\nThe swara differs from the shruti concept in Indian music. A shruti is the smallest gradation of pitch available, while a swara is the selected pitches from which the musician constructs the scales, melodies and ragas. The Natya Shastra identifies and discusses twenty two shruti and seven swara per octave. Of the twenty two shruti, veena scholars identified the 4th shruti to be sa solfege, 7th to be re, 9th as ga, 13th as ma, 17th as pa, 20th to be dha and 22nd as ni shuddha swara. With the course of time(the present system), the Sa swar is relocated to the 1st shruti and whole svar saptak is constructed accordingly. \n\nIt has been used in several contexts throughout the history of Indian music. Recent research has more precisely defined the term shruti, its difference from nada and swara, and pinpointed positions on a string to play 22 shrutis.\n\nThe most well-known example of shrutis is probably the use of the ati-komal (extra flat) gandhar in raga Darbari. Others include the rishabh in Bhairav, the nishad in Bhimpalasi and Miya Malhar, and the gandhar in Todi.\n\nMeaning\n\nThe meaning of shruti varies in different systems.\n\nGrama system\n\nBharata Muni uses shruti to mean the interval between two notes such that the difference between them is perceptible. He formulates jatis, which are classes of melodic structures. These can be further grouped into two gramas\u2014shadja-grama and madhyama-grama. The notes (swaras) are separated by intervals, as measured in shrutis.\n\nThe shadja-grama is given by the following division: Sa of four shrutis, Ri of three shrutis, Ga of two shrutis, Ma of four shrutis, Pa of four shrutis, Da of three shrutis and Ni of two shrutis. Abhinavagupta describes an experiment to obtain the correct physical configuration of shruti in shadja grama, Sarana Chatushtai.\n\nThe madhyama-grama is the same, but the panchama (Pa) has to be diminished by one shruti. That is, the panchama of madhyama-grama is lower than that of shadja-grama by one shruti, according to Bharata. Shruti is only mentioned as a perceptual measure in the music of Bharata's time.\n\nIn both the gramas, Ri is three shrutis away from Sa \u2013 there are three perceptible intervals between Sa and Ri. The third of these is called trishruti rishabha (Ri). Likewise, the second interval is called dvishruti rishabha, and the first ekashruti rishabha.\n\nNotes 9 and 13 shrutis from each other occur at a ratio of 100:133.33(3:4) and 100:150(2:3) respectively and are mutually samv\u0101di (consonant). The notes that are at the distance of two and 20 shrutis are mutually viv\u0101di (dissonant). The remaining ones are called anuv\u0101di (assonant).\n\nThe shruti table below shows the mathematical ratios considered to correspond to the system described by Bharata and Dattilam, along with the comparable notes in common Western 12-TET tuning. The names of the 22 shrutis were provided by \u015a\u0101r\u00f1gadeva.\n\nMela system\n\nBy the time Venkatamakhin formulated the melakarta (\"mela\") system, the grama system was no longer in use. Unlike the grama system, the mela system uses the same starting swara. It forms the scales by varying the intervals of the subsequent swaras, and does not specify a fixed interval for a swara in terms of shrutis. For example, the intervals of kakali-nishad and shuddha-madhyam vary depending on the dhaivat and the gandhar that precede them, respectively. The interval of kakali-nishad is of three different shruti values depending on whether shuddha, pancha-shruti or shat-shruti-dhaivat preceded it. Thus shruti as a measure of interval is not fully employed in the mela system.\n\nControversy\n\nIn current practice of Carnatic music, shruti has several meanings. It is used by musicians in several contexts. For instance, the Tamil term \"Oru kattai sruti (\u0b92\u0bb0\u0bc1 \u0b95\u0b9f\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0bc8 \u0bb8\u0bcd\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bbf)\" means that the tonic is set to the pitch C or the first key. The Telugu term \"Shruti chesuko (\u0c36\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c41\u0c24\u0c3f \u0c1a\u0c47\u0c38\u0c41\u0c15\u0c4b)\" is a way to correspond with the accompanying artists to tune their instruments.\n\nIn certain ragas, due to inflexions or gamakas on some of those 12 notes, listeners perceive a sharpened or flattened version of an existing note. Some scholars have attempted to fit such perceived new tones into the non-contextual Bharata's 22 shrutis, which lead to confusion and controversy. It was also wrongly attributed to Bharata, who proposed shruti in a completely different context.\n\nSome scientific evidence shows that these intermediate tones perceived in the contemporary rendition of a raga do not hint at the existence of 22 shrutis. The number 22 is of no practical significance in the current performance of Carnatic and Hindustani music traditions, partly because different musicians use slightly different \"shrutis\" when performing the same raga, an example being the ati-komal (extra flat) gandhar in Darbari. The phenomenon of intermediate tones is pursued as an active area of research in Indian Musicology, which says the number of perceptible intermediate tones may be less or more than 22. N. Ramanathan, a musicologist points this out and says that the idea of 22 shrutis is applicable only to the music system of Bharata's time.\n\nAn Indian monograph about shruti claims various opinions about the number (66, 53) of shrutis. In recent times it seems that the number of shrutis is broadly agreed upon to be 22. Recognizing the controversy over the number and the exact ratios of shruti intervals, it also says that not all shruti intervals are equal and known as pramana shruti (22%), nyuna shruti (70% cents) and purana shruti (90%). \u0415ach shruti may be approximated in 53EDO system.\n\nRelationship to , , and \n\nShruti is intimately linked to the fundamental aspects of .\n\n (Sanskrit) means sound of any kind. Out of all the  created in the world, sounds that are 'musical'\u2014give an experience or perception of a 'musical' sound\u2014are called Nadas. The sound of a 'clap' is a , but that of a bell is a nada. The commonest example of nada is a musical sound made on a stretched string under constant tension. There are innumerable 'nadas' in a Saptak (octave). Chaturdandi Prakashika (Sanskrit) by Pandit Venkatamakhin in Shloka 3, Chapter 2, stated that,\n\nmeaning,\n\n'Shrutis are the 'special' Nadas that cause . There is no difference between  and shrutis as both are nadas.\n\nOut of the innumerable  on a string, 22 become 'special' and are called shrutis because the perception of the 12 universal pitch classes of Chromatic scale (Swara-prakara) 'changes' with them. Further, Shrutis 'selected' in a Raga 'cause' (or become) the swaras. Thus, shrutis are called  in a raga, and both are primarily Nadas.\n\nIn this way, sounds () are progressively classified as:\n All sounds in the world are .\n Selected  become , (innumerable), which provide a musical experience.\n Selected Nadas become shrutis, (22), which create a change in the perception of 12 swaraprakaras (universal chromatic pitch classes) as we play them from one end of the string. This change happens only at 22 points as placed by nature.\n Selected (12 or fewer) shrutis become  \u2014 used in a particular raga.\nMatanga's conclusion is highly significant that 'Swaras' are manifested through the 'Shrutis'.  Note that swara in a raga (1 single frequency), is different from swaraprakara (12 universal pitch classes of a chromatic scale with a range of different frequencies). Gamakas or alankaras  or \u2018specific tonal configurations forming the core of a Raga\u2019  are merely a combination of shrutis and Nadas. (See section 2.9).\n\nIdentification of a shruti, distinct from nada \n\nIn performance, notes identified as one of the 12 universal pitch classes of Chromatic scale (swara-prakara) are the shrutis, and connected unidentified notes between them are nadas. The human ear takes about '20\u201345 msec' to identify a note within the range of the human voice\u2014from 100 to 1000\u00a0Hz. Thus, the ear can identify shrutis played or sung longer than that\u2014but cannot identify nadas played or sung faster than that limit, but can only hear them. Lack of appreciation of this difference has led to many scientists to opine that because of the meend and the oscillating notes, it is hard to determine the exact numerical frequencies. In a glide or meend. E.g., there are two 'Shrutis' at the two ends, which are connected by nadas in-between. This in fact, is the basic structure of any phrase created in Indian Music (Hindustani and Carnatic), as two or more shrutis connected by nadas. Indian Classical Music (both Hindustani and Carnatic) employs a combination of identifiable 'shrutis' and connecting, fleeting, unidentifiable nadas in any Alankara or Gamaka (Music).\n\nNatural existence of 22 shrutis on a string\n\nIn ancient times, shruti was described in Sanskrit as Shruyate iti Shruti, meaning, \"What is heard is a shruti\". This loose translation created confusion because, Shru (in Sanskrit) does not merely mean \"to hear\", but to \"hear, understand and learn\". The \"understanding\" and \"learning\" part is the natural fact that on 22 specific points on a string, the perception of notes changes.\n\nBrihaddeshi (Sanskrit) by Pandit Matanga  mentions after Shloka 24, in Shrutiprakarana (Chapter on Shrutis) that,\n\nShravanendriya Gr\u0100hyatv\u0100d Dhwanireva Shrutirbhavet\n\nmeaning, \"Only when the ear understands (the point on the string where perception of the notes changes), does that sound become a Shruti.\"       \nHe further says that these points on the string are very precise, as in Shloka 28, Chapter 1, in Nadaprakarana (Chapter on Nadas) that, \u0100d\u0100tmyam Cha Vivartatvam K\u0100ryatvam Parin\u0100mita Abhivyanjakat\u0100 Cha api Shrutin\u0100m Parikathyate  {\u0924\u093e\u0926\u093e\u0924\u094d\u092e\u094d\u092f\u0902 \u091a \u0935\u093f\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0924\u0924\u094d\u0935\u0902 \u0915\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0924\u094d\u0935\u0902 \u092a\u0930\u093f\u0923\u093e\u092e\u093f\u0924\u093e \u0905\u092d\u093f\u0935\u094d\u092f\u091e\u094d\u091c\u0915\u0924\u093e \u091a\u093e\u092a\u093f  \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0941\u0924\u0940\u0928\u093e\u0902 \u092a\u0930\u093f\u0915\u0925\u094d\u092f\u0924\u0947\n} meaning, \"Reaching (the point on the string where the perception of the notes changes), and reverting (from there) results in the precision that is called as 'Shruti.\"\n\nThere are 12 universally identifiable musical notes  (pitch classes of Chromatic scale or Swara-prakara) in a Saptak (Octave).They indicate 'a musical note or scale degree, but Shruti is a more subtle division of the octave'. The recent research has shown that 10 out of 12 of these notes (Swaraprakaras) have a 'spread' or a 'region' on a string (Swara-kshetra in Sanskrit) in which, 'any' frequency leads to the perception of the 'same' note by the human ear, and the perception 'changes' at both the ends. The remaining 2 notes, namely the Fundamental frequency (Shadja) and the perfect 5th (Panchama) have a 'single point' on which they are placed on the string by nature. Thus, the 10 notes give 20 Shrutis, and along with the 2 points of Fundamental frequency (Shadja) and the Perfect 5th (Panchama), a natural system of 22 Shrutis can be observed and played on any string.\n\nThese 22 Shrutis are not theoretical postulates, but solid musical facts that provide the foundation of Indian music, and have been used for centuries.\n\nSeveral ancient scholars have cited 22 Shrutis including Dattila (AD 400\u2013100 BC, in Shlokas 12\u201314), Sarangadeva (AD 1210\u20131247, after Shloka 11 in Sangeeta Ratnakara), Ramamatya (AD 1550 in Shlokas 24\u201326 in Swaramelakalanidhi), Somanatha (AD 1609 in Shloka 17, Chapter 1, in Ragavibodha) and Venkatamakhin (AD 1626\u20131662, in Shloka 5, Chapter 2; Shlokas 2\u20133, Chapter 3; and Shlokas 94, 105, 106, Chapter 4 in Chaturdandi Prakashika).\n\nThe 22 Shrutis can also be called as 'microtones', because they are produced at mathematically defined micro-positions.\n\nThe Evolution of 22 Shrutis from Shadja (Fundamental) and their natural arrangement on a string\n\nAll the 22 Shrutis evolve from Shadja (Fundamental).\n\nFigure showing the Evolution of 22 Shrutis from Shadja (Fundamental) and their natural arrangement on a string\n\nThe sequentially placed 12 universal pitch classes in an Octave on the string, are represented in the above diagram by the Indian synonyms r, R, g, G, M, m, P, d, D, n, N, S'. Most Western music divides the octave into 12 notes, whereas Indian classical music divides them into 22 notes. Except for P (Perfect 5th) and S'(Fundamental frequency) which are played at a single point each (13 and 22 respectively), all other 10 notes have a 'spread' or a 'region' on the string (Swara-kshetra). The 'beginning' and 'end' of these regions form a total of 22 points. e.g., For the region of r, the perception of r begins at point 1 (called swara-uday-bindu in Sanskrit meaning, the point where the swara emerges or starts) and ends at point '2' (called 'Swara-Asta-Bindu' in Sanskrit meaning, the point where the swara disappears or ends). For the region of 'R', the perception of R begins at point '3' and ends at point '4', and so on.\n\nIt is highly significant that Matanga arrives at the conclusion that Swara is manifested through the Shrutis and that Swaras are separated by each other by bands of Shrutis.\n\nRatios and frequencies\n\nIt was shown in this research that 22 Shrutis are essentially related to Shadja (Fundamental frequency), by most natural interval ratios, 100:125 (S:G) or 100:150 (S:P) as shown in the Figure below. This helps us to get their precise positions and frequencies.\n\nFigure showing 22 Shruti-Mandal (Organogram)\n\n1 denotes a 'lower' shruti or the 'beginning' of the region of the note on a string.\n2 denotes a 'higher' shruti or the 'end' of the region of the note on a string,\nSmall letters denote a komal or flatter version (except m, which is 'tara'),\nCapital letters denote a tara or sharper version (except M, which is 'komal'),\nVertical arrows indicate an interval ratio of 100:125.\nHorizontal arrows indicate an Interval ratio of 100:150.\n\nFig. showing 22 Shruti-Mandal (Organogram) (Carnatic).\n\n12 Swaras with their 16 names are shown as S, R1, R2/G1, R3, G1, G2/R3, G3, M1, M2, P, D1, D2/N1, D3, N1, N2/D3, N3.

Horizontal arrow indicates an Interval ratio of 100:150.\n\nTo calculate the frequency of Shrutis, for every horizontal arrow, 50% is added; and for every vertical arrow, 25% is added. e.g., to calculate the 'frequency' of P, consider the frequency of Shadja as 100\u00a0Hz (for convenience of calculation). Thus, P comes at 100\u00a0Hz + 50% = 150\u00a0Hz. The ratio of P thus becomes 150/100. To calculate the 'position' of  P on the string, we can use the law of Galileo Galilei, called in India as \u2018Dviguna\u2019 relationship, which states that the frequency ratio is 'inversely' proportional to the length of the string. Therefore, when the ratio 150/100 is 'inverted' we get the position of P on the string as 100/150 or 2/3 or 66.66% length of the string. We can calculate the frequencies and the positions of all the 22 shrutis accordingly.\n\nTable showing the Ratios, Frequencies, % length of the string where 22 Shrutis are played (*Frequency of the Fundamental frequency or Shadja taken as 100\u00a0Hz, as example)\n\nThus, Shrutis can be expressed as 1) 'Interval ratio',  2) Audio frequency, and 3) The playing position as % length of the string.\n\nThere is not a single common note between the European 12-Tone Equal Temperament Scale and the 22-Shruti-Indian scale.\n\nTable shows % frequency above Shadja (Fundamental Tone) of the \n12-Tone-Equal Temperament Scale and the 22-Shruti-Indian Scale.\n\nNew musical instruments have been made to demonstrate the accurate sounds, the position, and the practical use of 22 shrutis in music, including a 22-Shruti-Harmonium (Indian Patent No. 250197), 22-Shruti-Veena, 22-Shruti-Metallophone and 22 Shruti-Tanpura. In both the Hindusthani and Carnatic classical music, the places for playing 22 shrutis (as % length of the string) remain exactly the same on instruments such as Veena, Sarod, Sitar, Sarangi, Violin as shown in the table and diagram.\n\n4 Shrutis each of the notes R, G, M, D and N progress in a symmetrical order  of Poorna, Pramana, Nyuna, Pramana as shown in the diagram.\n\n22 Shrutis are a sub-set of Natural 7 Shrutis \n\nThe Indian Classical Music (both Hindustani and Carnatic) is based on the Tanpura, which produces the 1st 3 natural shrutis, Shadja (1st Harmonic), Gandhar (5th Harmonic), and Pancham (3rd Harmonic), at a ratio of 100:125:150. The basic 7 Shrutis are called \u2018Shuddha\u2019 (in Sanskrit meaning pure) in Hindustani Classical Music. They are produced at the same natural ratio as shown in the diagram with a   2-Step process.\n\nThus, the frequencies of the 1st Natural 7 Shrutis emerge as S=100 (taken for convenience), R=112.5, G=125, M =133.33, P=150, D=166.66, and N=187.5. The 22 Shrutis can be seen as a sub-set of 7 natural Shrutis as shown in the diagram.\n\nMusically, out of the 7 natural Shrutis, (see diagram)\n If R is taken as S, G becomes R1, coming at 111.1111111, a ratio of 10/9.\n If R is taken as S, M becomes g1, coming at 118.518518, a ratio of 32/27.\n If R is taken as S, S\u2019 becomes n1, coming at 177.777777, a ratio of 16/9.\n If G is taken as S, M becomes r2, coming at 106.666666, a ratio of 16/15.\n If G is taken as S, P becomes g2, coming at 120, a ratio of 6/5.\n If G is taken as S, S\u2019 becomes d2, coming at 160, a ratio of 8/5.\n If G is taken as S, R\u2019 becomes n2, coming at 180, a ratio of 9/5.\n If M is taken as S, N becomes m1, coming at 140.625, a ratio of 45/32.  \n If M is taken as S, R\u2019 becomes D2, coming at 168.75, a ratio of 27/16.\n If D is taken as S, R\u2019 becomes at M2, coming at 135, a ratio of 27/20.\n\nThese 10 Shrutis and the 7 natural Shrutis together make 17 out of 22 Shrutis, directly emerging from 7 natural Shrutis. The remaining 5 Shrutis is just a matter of filling the blanks considering the symmetrical order of R,G,M, D, and N.\n\nPoorna, Pramana and Nyuna Shrutis \n\nWhen the frequency and positions of all 22 shrutis are calculated, we get 3 ratios operating between 22 Shrutis as 256/243 (Pythagorean limma or Pythagorean diatonic semitone or Pythagorean minor semitone), 25/24 (a type of Just diatonic semitone) and 81/80 (Syntonic comma). Out of these, 81/80 operates in the 'region' of 10 notes and was called as 'Pramana', in Sanskrit meaning 'Standard' (region of the note). Out of the remaining 2 ratios, the bigger (256/243) was called as Poorna (in Sanskrit meaning 'big'), and the smaller (25/24) was called as 'Nyuna' (in Sanskrit meaning 'small'). Poorna comes between Shrutis 0\u20131, 4\u20135, 8\u20139, 12\u201313, 13\u201314, 17\u201318, and 21\u201322, Nyuna between Shrutis 2\u20133, 6\u20137, 10\u201311, 15\u201316, 19\u201320, and Pramana between Shrutis 1\u20132, 3\u20134, 5\u20136, 7\u20138, 9\u201310, 11\u201312, 14\u201315, 16\u201317, 18\u201319, 20\u201321. Now, it possible to play a precise note on a string every time without difficulty, because,  irrespective of the length of the string or the frequency in which the string is tuned,    7 Poorna, 5 Nyuna, and 10 Pramana Shrutis yield sequentially, perfect playing positions of 22 Shrutis on any string instrument. To eliminate confusion, the words Poorna, Pramana and Nyuna should be called as \u2018Shrutyantara\u2019 (in Sanskrit) meaning distance between Shrutis rather than \u2018Shruti\u2019, which indicates a musical note. Poorna, Pramana and Nyuna Shrutis correspond respectively to Pythagorean Limma (90 cents), Diatonic Semitone Minor (70 cents), and Comma of Didymus (22 cents).\n\nShrutis in Shadja Grama\n\nThe basic Indian Scale was called as Shadja Grama in Bharata's Natya Shastra. It had 7 notes emanating at Shruti nos. 3, 5, 9, 13, 16, 18, and 22 (See figure below). The precise places to play these 7 notes on a string is already shown in the above table. Bharata divided the scale of 7 notes by 'no.' of shrutis (distance measured by no. of shrutis).\n\nFigure showing Shadja Grama on a stretched string.\n\nThe 1st line shows Shruti nos. The 7 notes are in bold. \nThe 2nd line shows the synonyms and the 7 notes as bold and underlined. \nThe 3rd line shows the Shrutis 'in-between the 7 notes' as bold and underlined,\n\nBharata's Natya Shastra states in Chapter 28, Shloka 24 that S' is situated on the 4th shruti (after n1), M1 is situated on the 4th Shruti (after g1), P is situated on the 4th Shruti (after M1), R1 is situated on the 3rd Shruti (after S', the cycle repeats from the beginning), D1 is situated on the 3rd Shruti (after P), g1 is situated on the 2nd Shruti (after R1), and n1 is situated on the 2nd Shruti (after D1). Chaturdandi Prakashika (Sanskrit) by Pandit Venkatamakhin in Shloka 105 and 106, Chapter 4, narrates the same sequence of Shrutis as,\n\n Chatush Chatush Chatush Cha Eva Shadja Madhyama Panchamou Dve Dve Nish\u0100da G\u0100ndharou Tri Tri Rishabha Dhaivatou \n\nmeaning,\n\nShadja, Madhyama and Panchama (situated on) 4, 4, and 4; Nishad and Gandhara (situated on) 2 and 2; Rishabha and Dhaivata (situated on) 3 and 3.\n\nThus, the 7-Note scale as indicated by this arrangement is R1, g1, M1, P, D1, n1 and S', and is called as 'Shadja Grama' in Natya Shastra. This scale is close to the current version of the Kafi (raga). Thus, the notes of Shadja Grama are situated on Shruti nos. 3, 5, 9, 13, 16, 18, and 22; and these notes are separated by 3, 2, 4, 4, 3, 2, and 4 shrutis respectively.\n\nShadja Grama (the 7 notes documented by Bharata in Natyashastra) is very much in use today, providing the perfect Swaras for Ragas such as Abhogi, Bageshri, Bhimpalasi, and Gorakh Kalyan in Hindustani Classical Music; and Abheri, Reethigowla, and Suddha Dhanyasi in Carnatic Music. All the other Ragas too are derived from selection of different Shrutis as shown in the diagram.\n\nShrutis in Madhyama Grama\n\nThe ancient Indian musicologists knew that the voice range of females is placed by nature at a 'higher' pitch than males. They, therefore created the scale for females, beginning on the 9th Shruti (M1) with a higher frequency. Hence, this scale was called as Madhyama Grama in Bharata's Natya Shastra. It had 7 notes emanating at the same shruti nos. as in Shadja Grama, i.e., 3, 5, 9, 13, 16, 18, and 22. The precise places to play these 7 notes on a string is already shown in the earlier table. The precise place to play the new shruti, P1 is shown below.\n\nFigure showing Madhyama Grama on a stretched string.\n\nThe 1st line shows Shruti nos. The 7 notes are in bold. \nThe 2nd line shows the synonyms and the 7 notes as bold and underlined. \nThe 3rd line shows the Shrutis 'in-between the 7 notes' as bold and underlined\n\nBharata's Natya Shastra states in Chapter 28, Shloka 27 and 28, the shrutis in Madhyama Grama. As M1 functions as the 'new' Fundamental frequency (Shadja), M2 must become redundant as it is too close to it. Also, in this new scale, P from Shadja Grama operates as P2 or (musically, Ati-Tara Rishabha, see Nomenclature table below), and Tara Rishabha  or a shruti at an Interval ratio 10/9 (Just Major Second) is absent. To create this missing Tara Rishabha, P2 must be lowered by Interval ratio of 81/80 (Pramana) creating a new shruti P1. Chaturdandi Prakashika (Sanskrit) by Pandit Venkatamakhin in Shloka 65 and 66, Chapter 3, confirms the positions of Panchama both in Shadja and Madhyama Gramas as,\n Shadja Gr\u0100ma Panchame Swa Chaturtha Shruti Sansthite Swa-Up\u0100ntya Shruti Sansthe Asmin Madhyama Gr\u0100ma Ishyate \nmeaning,\n\nin Shadja Grama, Panchama is positioned on its 4th Shruti, and on its previous Shruti in Madhyama Grama.\n\nThis previous Shruti P1 has a frequency of 148.148 (if Shadja is taken as 100\u00a0Hz), and can be played on 67.56% length on the string.  The scale starting from M1 is close to the current version of Khamaj (raga). Now, the notes at 3, 5, 9, 13, 16, 18, and 22 becomes the Madhyama Grama, these notes are separated by 3, 2, 4, 3, 4, 2, and 4 shrutis respectively. Musically, P in Shadja Grama (3/2) operates as the Perfect 5th, and the same shruti (P2 in Madhyama Grama) operates as 9/8 (another ratio for Just Major Second) in Madhyama Grama, because the Fundamental frequency has changed to M1.\n\nA combination of \u2018Shrutis\u2019 and \u2018Nadas\u2019 is the back-bone of Gamakas, and Alankaras\n\nBoth the types of Indian Classical Music namely the Hindustani, and the Carnatic, essentially employ a variety of musical phrases known as Gamaka (Music) (Carnatic) and Alankara (Hindustani). These phrases employ primarily a combination of 'Shrutis' (identified steady notes) and connecting Nadas' (unidentified fleeting notes) only. Chaturdandi Prakashika (Sanskrit) by Pandit Venkatamakhin in Shloka 118, Chapter 3, gives the description of Gamaka as,\n Swarasya Kampo Gamakah, Shrotru Chitta Sukh\u0100vah, Sweeya Sth\u0100na Shruti Gatah Chhay\u0100m any\u0100m \u0100shray\u0100m api \nmeaning,\n                                                                                         \nSwara's movement creates Gamaka, delighting the listeners, going from the position of its own Shruti to reside in the shadow of another.\nGamaka or 'Alankara' thus means a Swara goes from its own (identifiable) Shruti to the other, making use of (unidentified connecting) 'Nadas' in-between.\n\nIn any Gamaka (Music), Alankara, or 'Inflexion', 'Ornamentation' etc., one can not have a 3rd type of note, other than a 'Shruti' and a 'Nada'. The threshold of identification of a musical note within the range of human voice of 100\u20131000 Hertz is 20\u201345 msec. Shrutis can be identified by the human ear because they are played for this time limit or more. As against this, connecting Nadas are played faster than this limit, which disallows the human ear to identify them. The major difference in the two systems is the way they combine shrutis and connect nadas, resulting in characteristically different music between the styles. Many ancient Sanskrit and Tamil works refer to 22 shrutis as the foundation of the Indian Music Scale.\n\nWhy does the Melakarta system (Carnatic) not have prescribed shrutis\n\nThe system of 72 basic types of singing or playing scales (Tha\u013cas) was evolved with specific mathematical combinations of the universal 12 pitch classes. The selection of the 22 Shrutis (specific frequencies) in each of them depends on the 'R\u0101ga' chosen. The Shrutis in a Raga should be ideally related to each other, by natural ratios 100:125, 100:133.33, 100:150, and 100:166.66. 'Raga' can have a 'lesser' no. of notes than those in a 'Tha\u013ca'. Therefore, Shrutis can be selected only 'after' the selection of a Raga. Melakarta 72 Thatas therefore do not have 'prescribed' Shrutis with them. Only 'Raga' can have shrutis, not 'Tha\u013ca'. Alaku is a name for Shruti in ancient Tamil music and 22 Shrutis are referred to as 22 Alakus. All the 22 Shrutis attain the status of Swaras, in some raga or the other.\n\nNomenclature of 22 Shrutis/Swaras in Carnatic Music and Hindustani Classical Music\n\nThe Nomenclature in Carnatic and Hindustani systems has been imperfect largely due to the ignorance about the scientific facts about 12 Swaraprakaras (Chromatic pitch-classes) and the inter-spaced 22 Shrutis. In Carnatic nomenclature, for example, the 'Eka'-sruthi Rishabham (called as Suddha Rishabham) is followed by 'Chatu'-sruthi Rishabham, omitting the 'Dvi' and 'Tri'-sruthi versions of Rishabham. The same is true of Daivatham too. In reality, the 'Eka'-sruthi Rishabham (as a Swaraprakara) has 'Eka'-sruthi Rishabham and 'Dvi'-sruthi Rishabham (as it is two ). Further, the 'Chatu'-sruthi Rishabham (as a Swaraprakara) has 'Tri'-sruthi Rishabham and 'Chatu'-sruthi Rishabham (as it is two ). The same is true of Daivatham. Also, there is the creation of an additional name each for Chatu-sruthi Rishabham, Sadharana Gandharam, Chatu-sruthi Daivatham and Kaishiki Nishadam; respectively as Suddha Gandharam, Shat-sruthi Rishabham, Suddha Nishadam and Shat-sruthi Daivatham. These apparent omissions and additions confound the Carnatic nomenclature. The all-inclusive Nomenclature for 12 Swaraprakaras and 22 Sruthis is shown in the Table.\n\nTable shows Nomenclature for 12 Swara-prakaras and 22 Shrutis in Carnatic Classical Music.\n\nSimilarly in Hindustani Music, the names of 'Komal' and 'Shuddha' Swaras have no uniformity. The Rishabha, Gandhar, Dhaivat and Nishad have the 'Komal' version first followed by 'Shuddha'; whereas for Madhyam, there is the 'Shuddha' version first followed by 'Teevra'. These names have also been carried forward due to ignorance about the meanings of these names, and also about 22 Shrutis. 'Komal' is the 'flatter' variety of the note and the correct name for the 'sharper' version is 'Tara', not 'Shuddha'. 'Teevra' (in Sanskrit) means 'of a larger volume', not 'of a higher frequency'! Hence, 'any' note such as Rishabha, Gandhar, Madhyama, Dhaivata and Nishad can be Teevra, or of a larger volume. The correct 12 names of Hindustani 12 notes are 1) Shadja, 2) Komal Rishabha, 3) Tara Rishabha, 4) Komal Gandhara, 5) Tara Gandhara, 6) Komal Madhyama, 7) Tara Madhyama, 8) Panchama, 9) Komal Dhaivata, 10) Tara Dhaivata, 11) Komal Nishada, and 12) Tara Nishad. 'Komal' notes are subdivided into their Shrutis 'Ati-Komal' (Lower frequency version) and 'Komal' (Higher frequency version); and 'Tara' notes into 'Tara' (Lower frequency version) and 'Ati-Tara' (Higher frequency version). Out of the 22 notes thus created, the word shuddha denotes 'purity' and signifies notes with a natural ratio of 100:125:150. Seven of the 22 notes (see table) are thus additionally called shuddha. The complete nomenclature for 12 swaraprakaras and 22 shrutis in Hindustani Classical Music is shown in the table.\n\nTable shows nomenclature for 12 swara-prakaras and 22 shrutis in Hindustani classical music.\n\n(* Seven shuddha notes in the table are underlined and bold.)\n\nThe 12 swaraprakaras and 22 shrutis in both the Hindustani and Carnatic tables are exactly the same in terms of ratios, frequencies, and percentage of length of the string where they are played.\n\nSanskrit Names of 22 Shrutis\n\nSangita Ratnakara of Sarangadeva states in Chapter 3, shlokas 35 to 38 that Teevra, Kumudvati, Manda and Chandovati are the names of shrutis for Shadja. As Shadja is placed on the 4th shruti in this group, this means that Chandovati is the name for the shruti of Shadja. The reference further mentions in further sequence; Dayavati/ Ranjani/Raktika as shrutis for Rishabha, Roudri/Krodha for Gandhara, Vajrika/ Prasarini/Priti/Marjani for Madhyama, Kshiti/Rakta/Sandipani/Alapini for Panchama, Madanti/Rohini/Ramya for Dhaivata, and Ugra/Kshobhini for Nishada.\n\nWhy performance analysis never gives true values for 22 Shrutis \n\nSome suggest that the best way to find the exact positions of shrutis is by analyzing the frequencies players use in actual performances. This sounds simple, but runs the risk of giving multiple inaccurate values. In fact, when different artists performed raga Yaman on flute, sarangi, sitar, and voice, accuracy of pitch was found to be 'relative' and 'subjective', and 'neither rigidly fixed','nor randomly varying'. Further, the 'same Swara was pitched differently at different times by the same artiste in the same raga', and 'different artistes intoned the same swara differently in the same raga'. Such an exercise is akin to estimating the centre of a large circular lake by comparing intersections between ropes stretched across the surface; this gives a range of answers, and introduces difficulties in estimating accuracy. It is more practical to define the centre of a circle mathematically, and then compute the centre of the lake relative to points fixed in advance. Similarly, the values of 22 shrutis can be precisely calculated based on their natural relationships to the 22 Shruti-Mandal (Organogram) rather than an analysis of performances.\n\nAncient treatises on Indian classical music and performing arts\n Natya Shastra by Bharata\n Dattilam by Dattila\n Brihaddeshi by Matanga Muni\n Abhinavabharati \u2013 Abhinava Gupta's commentary on Natya Shastra\n Sangita Ratnakara by Sarangadeva\n Svaramelakalanidhi by Ramamatya\n Charurdandi Prakashika by Venkatamakhin\n Ragavibodha by Somanatha\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nExternal links\n www.22shruti.com\n\nIndian classical music\nIntervals (music)\nHindustani music terminology\nCarnatic music terminology", "machine_text": "Shruti (music) refers to the smallest unit of pitch used in the Indian classical music system. It is also known as Swar in Indian classical music. Shruti is derived from the Sanskrit word \"Shru\" which means \"to hear\" or \"to get aware\". In Indian classical music, the concept of Shruti is of utmost importance as it lays the foundation for all other musical concepts. The term Shruti is used to describe the range of notes that are used in Indian classical music. The Indian musical system is based on a series of notes called the Saptak, which consists of seven notes. The seven notes in the Saptak are Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha, and Ni. Each of these notes can have multiple Shruti variations or microtones, thereby resulting in up to 22 notes in a single octave. This concept of Shruti serves as a tool to create a unique musical identity among various Indian classical music systems such as Hindustani music and Carnatic music. Each system is distinguished by the use of different Sharps or microtones, which are unique to that particular system. The concept of Shruti is essential in creating a precise and accurate rendition of Indian classical music. A musician must have a keen ear to identify and utilize the right Shruti and must also have the ability to find variations of the Shruti through practice and dedication. In conclusion, Shruti (music) is a fundamental concept in Indian classical music that plays a crucial role in creating distinctive melodies and rhythms in this unique genre of music. Through dedication, patience, and perseverance, musicians strive to capture the essence of Indian classical music by embracing the complexities of Shruti.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 597778}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Whitefield, Oklahoma\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Whitefield is a town in northwestern Haskell County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 391 at the 2010 census, compared with the figure of 231 recorded in 2000. It was named for Methodist bishop George Whitefield (1714 - 1770).\n\nHistory\nAt the time of its founding, the community that became Whitefield was located in the Moshulatubbee District of the Choctaw Nation, in the Indian Territory.\n\nWhitefield's history can be traced to the American Civil War, when the Confederate Army established Camp Pike for two thousand  Confederate soldiers in 1861. The camp was named for Confederate Brigadier General Albert Pike, who had persuaded the Five Civilized Tribes to ally with the Confederacy.\n\nAfter the end of the Civil War, Camp Pike became a Choctaw trading post. The trading post and the adjacent community were renamed as Oklahoma, Indian Territory. Its clientele were not only members of the Choctaw tribe, but also white settlers who had permits from the tribe to farm land in the Choctaw Nation. Occasionally, it was patronized by white outlaws such as Belle Starr, who were hiding from the law in the mountains of southern Oklahoma.The Post Office wanted to change the name because of confusion with another post office already known as Oklahoma Station. In 1888, the local residents voted to accept Whitfield as the name of the settlement and post office.  The post office at Whitefield, Indian Territory, which had originally been established as Oklahoma, Indian Territory on December 21, 1881, was reestablished on November 27, 1888.  It was named for Bishop George Whitefield, an early-day Methodist leader.\n\nWhitefield existed primarily as a town to support the nearby farms. By 1911, it counted approximately 500 residents. Improvements included two groceries, two general stores, a cotton gin and mill, a drugstore, a doctor, and a blacksmith. It had about 300 residents by 1920. Reportedly, the population declined sharply with the onset of the Great Depression. Whitfield incorporated in 1978, so its first Federal Census in 1980 recorded 240 people. The population has trended upward since that year.\n\nGeography\nWhitefield is located in northwestern Haskell County at  (35.253403, -95.237879), on high ground south of the Canadian River. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which  are land and , or 8.81%, are water.\n\nOklahoma State Highways 2 and 9 intersect in the center of Whitefield. OK-2 leads north  to Interstate 40 near Warner and south  to Kinta, while OK-9 leads east  to Stigler, the Haskell county seat, and west  to Eufaula.\n\nDemographics\n\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 231 people, 99 households, and 73 families residing in the town. The population density was 94.4 people per square mile (36.4/km2). There were 110 housing units at an average density of 44.9 per square mile (17.3/km2).

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Monarchy in Nova Scotia\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "By the arrangements of the Canadian federation, the Canadian monarchy operates in Nova Scotia as the core of the province's Westminster-style parliamentary democracy. As such, the Crown within Nova Scotia's jurisdiction is referred to as the Crown in Right of Nova Scotia, Her Majesty in Right of Nova Scotia, or the Queen in Right of Nova Scotia. The Constitution Act, 1867, however, leaves many royal duties in Nova Scotia specifically assigned to the sovereign's viceroy, the Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia, whose direct participation in governance is limited by the conventional stipulations of constitutional monarchy.\n\nConstitution\n\nThe role of the Crown is both legal and practical; it functions in Nova Scotia in the same way it does in all of Canada's other provinces, being the centre of a constitutional construct in which the institutions of government acting under the sovereign's authority share the power of the whole. It is thus the foundation of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the province's government. The Canadian monarch\u2014since 6 February 1952, Queen Elizabeth II\u2014is represented and her duties carried out by the Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia, whose direct participation in governance is limited by the conventional stipulations of constitutional monarchy, with most related powers entrusted for exercise by the elected parliamentarians, the ministers of the Crown generally drawn from amongst them, and the judges and justices of the peace. The Crown today primarily functions as a guarantor of continuous and stable governance and a nonpartisan safeguard against the abuse of power. This arrangement began with the 1867 British North America Act and continued an unbroken line of monarchical government extending back to the late 16th century. However, though Nova Scotia has a separate government headed by the Queen, as a province, Nova Scotia is not itself a kingdom.\n\nGovernment House in Halifax is owned by the sovereign in her capacity as Queen in Right of Nova Scotia and is used as an official residence both by the lieutenant governor and the sovereign and other members of the Canadian Royal Family will reside there when in Nova Scotia.\n\nRoyal associations\n\nThose in the Royal Family perform ceremonial duties when on a tour of the province; the royal persons do not receive any personal income for their service, only the costs associated with the exercise of these obligations are funded by both the Canadian and Nova Scotia Crowns in their respective councils. Monuments around Nova Scotia mark some of those visits, while others honour a royal personage or event. Further, Nova Scotia's monarchical status is illustrated by royal names applied regions, communities, schools, and buildings, many of which may also have a specific history with a member or members of the Royal Family. Associations also exist between the Crown and many private organizations within the province; these may have been founded by a Royal Charter, received a royal prefix, and/or been honoured with the patronage of a member of the Royal Family. Examples include the Royal Nova Scotia International Tattoo, which is under the patronage of Queen Elizabeth II and received its royal prefix from her in 2006.\n\nThe main symbol of the monarchy is the sovereign herself, her image (in portrait or effigy) thus being used to signify government authority. A royal cypher or crown may also illustrate the monarchy as the locus of authority, without referring to any specific monarch. Further, though the monarch does not form a part of the constitutions of Nova Scotia's honours, they do stem from the Crown as the fount of honour, and so bear on the insignia symbols of the sovereign.\n\nHistory\n\nNova Scotia's first monarchical connections were formed when Jacques Cartier in 1534 claimed Chaleur Bay for King Francis I, though the area was not officially settled until King Henry IV in 1604 established a colony administered by the Governor of Acadia. Only slightly later, King James VI and I laid claim to what is today Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and part of Maine and made it part of the Scottish Crown's dominion, calling the area Nova Scotia. James' son, Charles I, later issued the Charter of New Scotland, which created the Baronets of Nova Scotia, many of which continue to exist today. Over the course of the 17th century, the French Crown lost via war and treaties its Maritimes territories to the British sovereign.\n\nPrince Edward, Duke of Kent, was sent in 1794 to take command of Nova Scotia, where he, an amateur architect, designed many of Halifax's forts, oversaw the construction of numerous roads, devised a telegraph system, and left an indelible mark on the city in the form of public buildings of Georgian architecture. After he departed in 1800, he remained remembered for his deeds, such as the construction of both St. George's Round Church and the Halifax Town Clock, as well as improvements to the Grand Parade.\n\nFor the bicentennial in 1983 of the arrival of the first Empire Loyalists in Nova Scotia,  Prince Charles, Prince of Wales, and his wife, Diana, Princess of Wales, attended the celebrations.\n\nSee also\n Symbols of Nova Scotia\n Monarchy\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Royal Visits to Nova Scotia\n\nNova Scotia, Monarchy in", "machine_text": "Monarchy in Nova Scotia The monarchy in Nova Scotia refers to the role of the British monarch as the head of state of the Canadian province of Nova Scotia. The history of the monarchy in Nova Scotia dates back to the province's early days as a British colony and continues to the present day. The first British settlement in Nova Scotia was established in 1604 by French explorers, but it was not until 1713 that the province came under British rule following the Treaty of Utrecht. From that point on, the British monarch was recognized as the head of state of Nova Scotia and has remained so ever since. During the early days of British rule, the governor of Nova Scotia served as the representative of the monarch, and it was not until the mid-19th century that responsible government was introduced. Under responsible government, the premier and his or her cabinet are accountable to the elected representatives in the provincial legislature, but the British monarch retains a ceremonial role as head of state. The current monarch of Nova Scotia is King Charles III, who ascended to the throne in September 2022 following the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II. The Governor General of Canada, currently Mary Simon, represents the monarch in Canada and carries out various ceremonial duties on behalf of the Crown in Nova Scotia. Although the role of the monarch in Nova Scotia is largely ceremonial, it remains an important part of the province's history and culture. The Royal Family has made several visits to Nova Scotia over the years, and royal events such as the changing of the guard at the Halifax Citadel continue to be popular tourist attractions. In addition to its ceremonial role, the monarchy in Nova Scotia also has important constitutional functions, including the power to give royal assent to laws passed by the provincial legislature and the power to appoint judges and other officials. Overall, the monarchy in Nova Scotia serves as a reminder of the province's deep ties to Britain and its long history as a British colony. Despite the province's evolution into a modern Canadian province, the monarch continues to play a symbolic role in the life of Nova Scotians and remains an important part of the province's heritage.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 8518955}

The road runs almost parallel to the Malone Road, the two being joined by many side roads. It is a busy traffic route without much strong architectural character. Most of the housing is made up of red-brick terraces, some with alterations. Some buildings along the road, however, are considered to be architecturally important and interesting.\n\nLisburn Road itself begins at the nearby Bradbury Place and runs to Balmoral Avenue, beyond which it becomes Upper Lisburn Road. The Upper Lisburn Road extends south to reach Finaghy, at which point it becomes Kingsway and then in Dunmurry it becomes Queensway, before finally becoming the Belfast Road in Lisburn.\n\nHistory\nThe first record of the development of the Lisburn Road was when a property developer offered land for development 'West of the Lisburn Road' on 6 April 1813. His advert was placed in The News Letter on that date. The track that initially existed here developed and expanded, until pressure grew for a faster turnpike road to Dublin, to avoid the Malone Road hills and valleys. During 1817\u20131819 this road improvement scheme was implemented. The post office and toll booth stood, conveniently, at Shaftesbury Square, and presumably served both turnpike roads. At the top of Tate's Avenue, on the Lisburn Road side of the junction a second booth was in existence in 1857. One year later the toll business was abandoned, as the trains had taken over. Shopping habits have changed and the shopping population has moved from Shaftesbury Square, along the Lisburn Road.\n\nLisburn Road attracted shops and the nearby Malone Road was left residential. Queen's University is nearby, and there are a high number of expensive shops and restaurants, most of which are located at the upper end of the road. The Belfast City Hospital and the Queen's University Medical Biological Centre are also located on the road.\n\nRacist attacks\nIn June 2009, having had their windows broken and deaths threats made against them, twenty Romanian Romani families were ejected from their homes in Lisburn Road. Up to 115 people, including women and children, were forced to seek refuge in a local church hall after being attacked. They were later moved by the authorities to a safer location.\nAs a result of petty thefts gypsies were told to leave, they spent one night at QUB Elms Village at a cost of 40 pounds per room. \nFollowing the arrest of three local youths in relation to the attacks, the church where the Romani people had been given shelter was badly vandalised. Niall Colton and Kevin Briggs, who both attended QUB at the time of the attack, received police cautions after admitting vandalism of the Church.

The road is approximately 2.5 miles (4 km) long and passes through several distinctive commercial and residential areas. History The Lisburn Road originally formed part of the route from Belfast to Lisburn, which was an important market town in the region. It was developed in the mid-19th century as a fashionable residential area for the middle and upper classes, with many large Victorian terraces built along the road. The area was also home to several notable figures, including Sir Edward Harland, the founder of the Harland and Wolff shipyard. In the early 20th century, the area became a hub for commercial activity, as more shops and businesses opened along the road. During World War II, the Lisburn Road was badly damaged by a German air raid, but it was soon rebuilt and returned to its former status as a key commercial and residential area in Belfast. Shopping and leisure The Lisburn Road is renowned for its wide range of boutique shops, independent retailers, and high-end fashion brands. It is also home to many popular restaurants, cafes, and pubs that cater to a diverse range of tastes and preferences. Education There are several schools located along the Lisburn Road, including Victoria College, a renowned girls\u2019 school that has been in operation since 1859. Queen\u2019s University Belfast, one of the UK\u2019s leading higher education institutions, is also located on nearby University Road.

Estimations vary as to the abruptness of the reversal. A 2004 paper estimated that it took over several thousand years; a 2010 paper estimated that it occurred more quickly, perhaps within a human lifetime; a 2019 paper estimated that the reversal lasted 22,000 years.\n\nThe apparent duration at any particular location can vary by an order of magnitude, depending on geomagnetic latitude and local effects of non-dipole components of the Earth's field during the transition.\n\nThe Brunhes\u2013Matuyama reversal is a Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP), selected by the International Commission on Stratigraphy as a marker for the beginning of the Middle Pleistocene, also known as the Ionian Stage. It is useful in dating ocean sediment cores and subaerially erupted volcanics. There is a highly speculative theory that connects this event to the large Australasian strewnfield (c. 790,000 years ago), although the causes of the two are almost certainly unconnected and only coincidentally happened at the same time.

It is named after Bernard Brunhes, who discovered it in 1906, and Motonori Matuyama, who independently described it in 1929. This reversal marked a change in the direction of the Earth's magnetic field from normal (similar to the current magnetic field) to reversed (opposite to the current magnetic field). The Brunhes\u2013Matuyama reversal was significant in that it provided proof of plate tectonics. Scientists were able to study the magnetic field alignment of rocks on either side of the oceanic ridges and see that they were symmetrical, indicating a spreading sea floor. The reversal also allows scientists to more accurately date volcanic rocks and marine sediment. The exact cause of magnetic reversals is still unknown, but it is theorized that they may be the result of complex interactions between solid and liquid Earth layers or the result of active regions of the Earth's core generating magnetic fields that affect the surrounding layers. The Brunhes\u2013Matuyama reversal is just one of several magnetic reversals that have occurred over the Earth's history. The last reversal occurred approximately 780,000 years ago and is known as the Matuyama-Brunhes boundary. Despite concerns about the effects of a magnetic reversal on the Earth's climate and the potential for damage to electronic devices, the Earth's magnetic field is expected to continue its normal fluctuations and eventually reverse again in the future. Overall, the Brunhes\u2013Matuyama reversal is an important event that has helped advance our understanding of the Earth's magnetic field and its role in shaping our planet's geology and history.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1132221}

According to legend, it is the burial site of Eve, the first woman and wife of Adam according to Abrahamic religions. The tomb is located in the historical district of Al-Balad, which was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2014. There is no archaeological or scientific evidence to support the claim that the tomb belongs to Eve. However, the site has been revered by locals and visitors of different faiths for centuries. Muslims believe that Eve was buried here after she and Adam were banished from the Garden of Eden in Mecca, which is about 70 km away. The tomb is a simple structure made of stone and has a dome-shaped roof. The interior is decorated with intricate Arabic calligraphy and Quranic verses. Women are not permitted to enter the tomb itself, but they can view it from a special platform. Some scholars suggest that the tomb was originally a pre-Islamic structure dating back to the 7th century. Others believe that it was built during the Abbasid era in the 9th or 10th century. Regardless of its origins, the Tomb of Eve has become a symbol of faith and tradition in the region. The site has undergone several renovations and restorations over the years. In 2009, the Saudi government completed a multi-million-dollar restoration project to preserve the tomb and surrounding buildings. Today, it is a popular tourist attraction and pilgrimage site for Muslims and non-Muslims alike.

Pinafore (1878) and Frederic in The Pirates of Penzance (1880).\n\nHe later became a noted voice teacher and continued to perform, mostly at society events. On the death of his elder brother, in 1903, he became the seventh baronet of Kilfane.\n\nEarly years\nPower was born in Kilkenny, the fourth son of Sir John Power of Kilfane, and his wife, Frances Elizabeth, n\u00e9e Wade, from Clonabrany, County Meath. He was educated at Cheltenham College and Trinity College, Dublin, and studied voice in Milan and Florence from 1873 to 1876, with Achille Graffigna and Francesco Lamperti, among others.\n\nIn 1876, Power first appeared on stage at the Teatro Manoel in Valletta, Malta, singing Count Almaviva in The Barber of Seville.  He made his London stage debut in December 1877 at Her Majesty's Theatre playing the tenor role in Thomas Haynes Bayly's English version of Adolphe Adam's opera The Swiss Cottage. This proved to be Power's only appearance in serious opera.\n\nPower joined Richard D'Oyly Carte's Comedy-Opera Company in February 1878 at the Opera Comique in London, succeeding George Bentham in the leading tenor role of Alexis in Gilbert and Sullivan's comic opera The Sorcerer. From March to April 1878 Power also played the Defendant in Trial by Jury when that companion piece was added to the bill at the Opera Comique. He created the role of Ralph Rackstraw in the next Gilbert and Sullivan opera, H.M.S. Pinafore, \"one of the most successful pieces of musical theatre of the Victorian era\" playing the character from May 1878 to February 1880. The Daily News wrote that Power \"displayed a light tenor voice of very agreeable quality, and acted the part of the sentimental lover well\", although The Times found his intonation \"a little uncertain\".\n\nWhen The Pirates of Penzance premiered in London, Power originated the role of Frederic in that opera. Power received warm reviews for this role from the London press. The Times said that his \"sympathetic tenor voice was heard to great advantage in the sentimental music\", and The Standard wrote that he \"acts ... just in that simple-minded way that brings out most strongly the absurdity of the character, and he sings exceedingly well.\" A critic from The New York Times, however, commented: \"Temple has been a member of the Gilbert-Sullivan company from the first.  Mr George Power has not: and his \"thin\" style is a material drawback. As an actor, he is weak, as a man he is not interesting, as a tenor he is small. Once or twice he sang sweetly, and he was always in tune.  As a concert singer he would probably be very successful in sentimental ballads; as Frederic he is unsatisfactory.\" The Era agreed with the majority: \"a very agreeable light tenor voice and a pleasing style, qualities which have already gained for him no little favour in the previous opera \u2026 [he has] good taste vocally and a fair amount of histrionic skill.\"\n\nDuring the run of Pirates, Power took part in some Sunday matin\u00e9e performances of new operettas along with D'Oyly Carte colleague Rutland Barrington, and on one occasion acted in a non-musical play, L'Aventuri\u00e8re, given in the original French by a cast headed by Herbert Beerbohm Tree. Power played Frederic until October 1880, when he left the D'Oyly Carte company.\n\nLater years\n\nOver the following months, Power performed mostly in society concerts. In May 1881, he appeared in the operetta Incognito, by Henri Log\u00e9, and in July 1881, Power played Lieut. de Blanc-Mange in a short operetta, Out of Sight, by Frederick Clay and B. C. Stephenson. In August 1881, he created the role of Charles Lorrimore in the Edward Solomon and Henry Pottinger Stephens comic opera Claude Duval, at the Olympic Theatre, opposite Marion Hood, who had been his partner in The Pirates of Penzance. The production ran for only 54 performances, and Power left the production three days before it closed in October.\n\nPower then became a teacher of singing, continuing to make occasional appearances on the stage until he end of the century, mostly in concert and society events, and with Percy North's Operetta Company. In 1885 he played Colonel Sylvester at Hove in a new operetta, When One Door Shuts Another Opens by Harriet Young and Charles Thomas. His students included the Russian tenor Vladimir Rosing.\n\nWhen his elder brother Sir Adam Clayton Power (1844\u20131903) died, Power succeeded to his family's baronetcy as the seventh baronet of Kilfane. Together with Jessie Bond, Leonora Braham and Julia Gwynne, he was one of four artistes of the original D'Oyly Carte Opera Company who attended a reunion at the Savoy Hotel in 1914. The four then posed for a group photograph beside Arthur Sullivan Memorial in the Victoria Embankment Gardens.\n\nOn 2 September 1915, by then in his late 60s, Power married Eva Gertrude Boulton (1864\u20131952), the daughter of family friend Sir Samuel Bagster Boulton and Sophia Louisa Cooper. There were no children, and the Power baronetcy ended on his death in 1928.\n\nPower died in Kensington, London, aged 81, and is buried in the Boulton Family Vault in Brookwood Cemetery.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nPower interviewed in The Era, 18 July 1908, p. 15\n \n\n1846 births\n1928 deaths\nPeople educated at Cheltenham College\nAlumni of Trinity College Dublin\n19th-century British male opera singers\nBaronets in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom\n19th-century Irish male opera singers", "machine_text": "Sir George Power, 7th Baronet, was a British landowner and politician who lived from 1787 to 1859.

Feel\u2026 is a word of emotion that refers to the sense of touch, emotions, and the sensation of an event or experience. The word is frequently used to elucidate the emotional connections between individuals and the world around them. The term \u201cfeel\u201d often connotes a sense of physical touch, such as the way one feels when they touch a rough surface, a soft fabric, or the warm sun on their skin. The sensation of feel can be intensified by an individual\u2019s perception of pressure, temperature, or discomfort. Furthermore, the word \u201cfeel\u201d also denotes the emotional responses to external stimuli. For instance, one might feel happy, sad, anxious, or angry in certain situations. These emotional feelings are subjective and can change depending on an individual's experiences and perspectives. In music, the term \u201cfeel\u201d is used to describe the emotional intensity of a piece. Musicians strive to evoke feelings in their listeners through the sound and rhythm of their music. In the context of sports, the term \u201cfeel\u201d is used to describe an individual's ability to control their movements and connect with the equipment or field. Athletes might refer to their \u201cfeel\u201d for the ball or puck in order to describe their ability to move and manipulate their equipment to achieve their goals. Finally, in the world of literature, the term \u201cfeel\u201d is used to describe the emotional impact of a particular work. Whether it\u2019s a novel, poem, or play, authors strive to convey their stories in a way that evokes strong feelings in readers.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Oath of Pontida\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The oath of Pontida (Giurament de Pontida in Lombard, Giuramento di Pontida in Italian), according to tradition, would have been a ceremony that would have sanctioned on 7 April 1167, in the abbey of Pontida, near Bergamo, in Italy, the birth of the Lombard League, or of a military alliance between the municipalities of Milan, Lodi, Ferrara, Piacenza and Parma aimed at the armed struggle against the Holy Roman Empire by Frederick Barbarossa.\n\nThe oath of Pontida does not appear on contemporary documents, being mentioned for the first time in 1505, then three and a half centuries after the traditional date of 7 April 1167.\n\nHistory\n\nContemporary sources\n\nThe event is questioned by historians, given that in the contemporary chronicles written between 1152 and 1189, no Pontida oath is cited. Its first mention is in fact late, since it appears on a document dated 1505.\n\nHowever, contemporary sources cite the fact that the municipalities of the Lombard League had signed pacts to counter Barbarossa's hegemony by helping each other. Most of these writings, however, argue the event in a rather vague way, without describing the details: neither the locations nor the precise dates of the signing of the pacts are mentioned. On the Piacentina chronicle, regarding the agreement reached for the rebuilding of Milan, we can read:\n\nThe most precise contemporary historical sources tell of at least three oaths among the municipalities of the Lombard League: the first, signed between the end of February and the beginning of March 1167 between Bergamo, Brescia, Cremona and Mantua and known as the \"Bergamo oath \"; the second, also signed by Milan in March 1167, which joined the four cities in the just mentioned oath; the third, also signed by Lodi in May of the same year, which became part of the previously mentioned coalition, formed by Bergamo, Brescia, Cremona, Mantua and Milan.\n\nConsidering the date of 7 April 1167, we can therefore state that the oath of Pontida, even if it was actually signed, was not the constitution of the Lombard League, since at least two previous oaths are cited on historical documents.\n\nThe following documents\n\nIn addition to the chronological aspect, which would seem to demonstrate the non-existence of the oath of Pontida as a constitutive pact of the Lombard League due to the two agreements signed before 7 April 1167, the first mention of the incident must certainly also be considered which is quite posterior.\n\nIn particular, the oath of Pontida appears for the first time on a document dated 1505 by Bernardino Corio - therefore about 350 years after the canonical date of 7 April 1167 - which is called Historia Patria and which has as its subject the history of Milan.\n\nThen all the subsequent documents referring to the oath of Pontida were inspired by the Historia Patria by Bernardino Corio. In an excerpt from the code of 1584 Successores S. Barnabae Apostoli in Ecclesia Mediolanensi, which refers to a note on the archbishop of Milan Umberto Pirovano, it is reported that:\n\nIn Archiepiscoporum Mediolanensium series historico-chronologica, which was compiled by Giuseppe Antonio Sassi in 1755 and which is linked to the aforementioned text of 1584, it can instead be read:\n\nHypothesis on a possible oath of Pontida\nHowever, it is possible that there were other agreements signed by the municipalities of the Lombard League of which the documented trace was then lost. In fact, over the centuries, there are many examples in which several meetings were needed to write down all the aspects of a bargaining: in other words, in history, it has been difficult to define in detail a pact or an alliance in few sessions.\n\nAs far as Pontida is concerned, we must also observe its close link with Milan: the municipality near Bergamo belonged to the archdiocese of Milan although it was understood, from a geographical point of view, in the county of Bergamo.\n\nIt is therefore not excluded that there was also an oath at Pontida, whose references to contemporary documentation were then lost.\n\nCommemorations\nEvery year at Pontida, in the month of June, in the Giuramento square, the historical phases that led to the birth of the military pact signed, according to tradition, on 7 April 1167 are recalled by about one hundred people in costume. On the occasion of the re-enactment, recreational and cultural events are also organized.\n\nSince 1990, the autonomous political party of the Lega Nord has annually organized a meeting at Pontida that celebrates the eponymous medieval oath. During the event the most important political exponents of the party intervene.\n\nCitations\n\nReferences\n\n \n\n1167 in Europe\n12th century in Italy\n1160s in the Holy Roman Empire\nHistory of Lombardy\nOaths", "machine_text": "The Oath of Pontida was a historical event that took place in Italy, in the town of Pontida, located in the region of Lombardy, in the year 1167. The name of the event refers to the oath that a group of Lombard towns took against the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa. The Lombards were a Germanic tribe that settled in Italy during the Migration Period, and their presence had a significant impact on the history and culture of Italy. In the Middle Ages, Lombardy was a region of northern Italy that included several powerful city-states, such as Milan, Lodi, Bergamo, Brescia, and Crema. In the 12th century, the Lombard cities were under the control of the Holy Roman Empire, led by the powerful Emperor Frederick Barbarossa. However, the Lombards were dissatisfied with the Germanic rule and sought to break away from the empire and establish their own autonomous region. To achieve this, a group of Lombard leaders came together in the town of Pontida and took an oath to defend their lands and liberties against the emperor. The oath became known as the Oath of Pontida and marked the beginning of the Italian League. The Italian League was a political and military alliance that aimed to establish an independent Lombard state and protect it from the threats of the Holy Roman Empire. The League was successful in securing its independence for a time, but eventually, the Lombards were defeated by the imperial forces of Frederick Barbarossa. The Oath of Pontida is considered a pivotal moment in Italian history, as it symbolizes the desire of the Lombards to break away from foreign rule and establish a sense of Italian identity and autonomy.

Ernest Tubb was born on February 9, 1914, in Ellis County, Texas, and grew up in nearby Crisp, Texas. He began singing and playing guitar when he was a teenager and formed his first band in the late 1930s. He was heavily influenced by the early country music of Jimmie Rodgers and the blues of Blind Lemon Jefferson. Tubb's music was characterized by his distinctive honky-tonk style, which featured a heavy emphasis on the steel guitar and a heartfelt delivery. His songs typically dealt with themes of heartbreak and lost love, and he became known as \"the Texas Troubadour\" for his ability to capture the emotional essence of his music. Ernest Tubb was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1965 and continued to perform and record until his death in 1984.

He married twice: in 1941 to Meri Mirjam Gyllenb\u00f6gel, who died 1956 (they had one son and two daughters including the ballerina and choreographer Sorella Englund); and in 1958 he married Maynie Sir\u00e9n, a singer, with whom he had one son.\n\nOne of the most important Finnish symphonists since Jean Sibelius, Englund was a native Swedish speaker who often felt that his career was sidelined from the mainstream of Finnish music.\n\nHe went to Svenska normallyceum i Helsingfors and was 17 when he began studies at the Helsinki Conservatory (now the Sibelius Academy) in 1933. Already a considerable pianist, he continued his studies with Martti Paavola and Ernst Linko while studying composition with Bengt Carlson and Selim Palmgren.\n \nFollowing his graduation in 1941, Englund was conscripted into military service. During his time in the Finnish Continuation War he was wounded in his hand, which almost brought to an end his hopes of pursuing a career as a concert pianist. He would often recall the bizarre, though life-threatening incident, with a smile.\n\nMusic\nEnglund's first work for large orchestra was his First Symphony (1946), which became known as the \"War Symphony\". This was no apprentice piece; the use of counterpoint, dissonance and orchestration of singular clarity reveals a master at work. His Second Symphony, the \"Blackbird Symphony\", soon followed the first.\n\nIn 1949 Englund was awarded a grant to study in the United States with Aaron Copland, and he also played jazz with Leonard Bernstein. It has been suggested that Englund's study with the American master consisted of discussions about music and composition, Copland having realised that there was little he could teach the younger man.\n\nThroughout the 1950s he produced a series of large-scale works including Sinuhe, a ballet  (1953) originally for piano though later orchestrated, and Odysseus (1959), written for the Swedish dancer and choreographer Birgit Cullberg, a Cello Concerto (1954) and the First Piano Concerto (1955), as well as film scores and incidental music. His score for Erik Blomberg\u2019s Valkoinen peura (The White Reindeer), which won a Jussi Award (the Finnish Oscar), and his score for Max Frisch\u2019s play The Great Wall of China are particularly notable.\n\nHe composed music for twenty films, as well as works for choir including the Hymnus Sepulcralis (1975).\n\nDuring the 1950s, with his second wife, the singer Maynie Sir\u00e9n, he performed a cabaret act; he was music critic of the Swedish-language Hufvudstadsbladet, and he taught at the Sibelius Academy from 1958 until 1982.\n\nHis Third Symphony (1971) appeared 23\u00a0years after his second and signalled his return to composition; he had written only a few works during the 1960s. There soon followed his Fourth (1976) and Fifth Symphonies (1977) and the Concerto for Twelve Cellos (1981).\n\nEnglund\u2019s Sixth Symphony (1984), subtitled Aphorisms, is in six movements for chorus and orchestra; his last symphony, the Seventh, was composed in 1988, coinciding with the onset of the heart disease that signalled a decline in health and would ultimately lead to his death. His Clarinet Concerto of 1991 was completed shortly before a stroke rendered further composition physically impossible. Later he suffered from kidney failure, which necessitated dialysis for the remainder of his life.\n\nEnglund also composed chamber music, including a suite for solo cello and a sonata for cello and piano; there are also works for violin and piano, solo trombone, and solo piano.\n\nHis memoirs, I Skuggan av Sibelius (In the Shadow of Sibelius), were published in 1997.

Born in Ljugarn, \u00c5land, Englund began his formal studies in music at the Sibelius Academy in Helsinki and later studied with Wolfgang Fortner in Germany. Englund\u2019s early works were largely influenced by Jean Sibelius but later evolved to incorporate the techniques of modernist composers such as Igor Stravinsky and B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k. Though his music was frequently associated with wartime Finland and the nation's struggle for independence, he also drew inspiration from the natural scenery of his homeland. Englund\u2019s most notable works include the Third Symphony, \"Metamorphoses\" and the Piano Concerto No. 1. He was also a prolific composer of chamber music and vocal music. Englund worked as a conductor with the Turku Philharmonic Orchestra, the Finnish National Opera, and the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra, amongst others. In addition to his musical career, Englund was also an ardent supporter of LGBTQ rights in Finland and an active member of leftist political groups throughout his life. Despite much of his music having a more conservative flavor, he did not shy away from sharing his progressive views through his music, and was known for being a supporter of social justice, particularly with regards to labor rights and equality. Englund was honored with several awards and accolades throughout his career including the Nordic Council Music Prize in 1971 and was granted the Finnish Order of the Lion of Finland. Today, his music is regularly performed and recorded internationally and considered an essential part of Finland\u2019s cultural heritage.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2153671}

His first album \"85\" released in 2006, was a massive commercial success within Iran and with the Iranian diaspora abroad. Also known as his stage name Benyamin, he is one of the most popular pop singers in Iran. Benyamin has released four studio albums and numerous singles so far. He also sang sound tracks for the Movies \"Gorgo Mish\" and \"A Few Cubic Meters of Love\"  (\"Chand Metr Moka'ab Eshgh\"). In 2007, a BBC documentary called \"Rageh Inside Iran\" described him as a \"Big Star of Iran\" who had sold twenty million copies of his album at the beginning of his career. Although basically a pop singer, Benyamin often includes elements of hip hop (Biya Ashegham kon) and rap (Kojaye Donyai) into his music and some of the songs in his latest album \"94\" have English lyrics. Benyamin is also known as \"Aghae Eshgh\" or \"Mr. Love\" among his fans because his songs are mostly centered on romantic themes.\n\nEarly life \nBenyamin (born as Vahid Bahadori) was born into a traditional Muslim family of Jewish descent and grew up in a small neighborhood in the south of Tehran. He became interested in music ever since he was child. To honor his Jewish lineage, he chose the stage name Benyamin, derived from Hebrew, referring to the Biblical figure of the same name.\n\nAlbums \n\nBenyamin's first album was an instant hit, It turned him into a star in a short time. Songs from first album \"85\" include \"Khatereha\" (Memories) also known as \"Donya Dige Mesle To Nadare\", \"Loknat\" (Stutter), \"Adam Ahani\" (Robot) also known as \"Halam Badeh\" and \"Man Emshab Mimiram\" (I Will Die Tonight).

His second album \"88\" was released in April 2009 and sold 500,000 units within a week of its release. It contains a total of 17 songs (most in any of his four albums) and includes popular songs like \"Shenasnameh\", \" Kojaye Donyai\" (Where in the world), \" Ahay to\"(Hey you), \"Sedaye Ghalbe to\"(Sound of your heart) and \"Leili dar Paeiz\"(layla in the Autumn).

His last album \"94\" was released in July 2015, just over a year after the release of his third album. This is the shortest time period between two albums and it was a pleasant surprise for his fans because the last album took too long to come out. This album has songs like \"Eshkal\", \"Havasam Be Toe\", \"Track 4\" and \" Barana\" which he sang for his daughter Barana Bahadori. Benyamin has experimented with the addition of English lyrics in his latest album and it has got mixed reviews from fans.\n\nHis albums are named after the year in which they were released according to the Persian calendar.\n\nBenyamin Bahadori is also noted for his religious-themed compositions like \"Agham Agham\", \"Karbala\", \"Ye Pahlevon\", \"Lalaii\".\n\nConcerts \n\nHe made his official concert debut inside Iran in March 2010 during the \"Fajr International Music Festival\" held at Milad Tower in Tehran and has been performing there every year since. Apart from that, he has performed in many of the cities across Iran and many countries around the world like England, Germany, Austria, Norway, Australia, Malaysia, Tajikistan, America, Canada, U.A.E.\n\nBenyamin Music Group \nBenyamin has this particular group of musicians that travel with him in and outside of the country to perform in concerts.

Benyamin did not announce the news of his marriage, and most people were unaware of his wife and kid until the death of his wife in an accident in Tehran on 20 December 2013. Benyamin was driving home, along with Nasim and (at the time) their two-year-old Barana, when the car ran off the road; Benyamin and Barana did not get hurt, but Nasim died hours later in the hospital due to severe injuries. Benyamin released a song called \"Ye khoone\" (A house), which he sang in memory of his late wife and according to a post he made on Facebook, took eleven years to complete.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Finland Plot\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "In Thailand politics, the Finland Plot, Finland Plan, Finland Strategy, Finland Conspiracy or Finland Declaration (, ) are names of a controversial conspiracy theory espoused by Sondhi Limthongkul and supporters affiliated with the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) in 2006 describing a plot allegedly developed by Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra and former left-wing student leaders to overthrow the former Thai monarch, take control of the nation, and establish a communist state.  The plot allegedly originated in Finland.\n\nThe allegations damaged the popularity of Thaksin and his government, despite the fact that no evidence was ever produced to verify the existence of a plot. Thaksin and his Thai Rak Thai (TRT) party vehemently denied the accusations and sued the accusers.  The leaders of the 2006 military coup claimed Thaksin's alleged disloyalty as one of their rationales for seizing power.\n\nBackground \nProtests against Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra increased throughout 2005 and 2006 due to a variety of factors, including his April 2005 appearance at a merit-making ceremony at the Temple of the Emerald Buddha, the September 2005 cancellation of Sondhi Limthongkul's Muangthai Raisabdah television show, Thaksin's November 2005 plan to give local communities control of public schools, Thaksin's sale of Shin Corporation in January 2006, and Thaksin's alleged role in the March 2006 destruction of the Phra Phrom Erawan shrine.\n\nFinland Plot \n\nIn May 2006, on the eve of King Bhumibol Adulyadej's 60th anniversary celebrations, the Sondhi Limthongkul-owned Manager Daily newspaper published the details of what it called the \"Finland Plan,\" \"Finland Declaration,\" or \"Finland Strategy.\"  The articles claimed that Thaksin and former student leaders of Thailand's 1970s democratic movement met in Finland in 1999 to develop a plan to institute rule by a single party, overthrow the monarchy and establish a republic, and hold elections for provincial governors.  The 5-part article was titled \"Finland Strategy: Thailand's Revolution Plan?\" was written by Pramote Nakhonthap and appeared on 17, 19, 22, 23 and 24 May 2006. Thaksin's alleged co-conspirators apparently included Thai Rak Thai party members Prommin Lertsuridej (Secretary-General to the Premier), Chaturon Chaisaeng (Deputy Prime Minister), Surapong Suebwonglee (Minister of Information and Communications Technology), Adisorn Piangket (Former Deputy Science Minister), Sutham Saengprathum (Deputy Interior Minister), and Phumtham Wechayachai (Deputy Transport Minister), all of whom had been affiliated with the Communist Party of Thailand following the massacre of 6 October 1976.\n\nThe allegations were taken up by several prominent critics, including leaders of the People's Alliance for Democracy, constitution drafter Chai-anan Samudavanija, Senator Sophon Supapong, writer Pramote Nakornthab, and Democrat leader Thaworn Senniam.\n\nNone of the accusers provided any evidence to back up their allegations.  Sondhi noted that his source was a Thai Rak Thai worker who had recently \"defected.\"\n\nVariations and denials \n\nVariations of the original theory were also proposed, including the claim that the plot involved overseas groups intent on overthrowing the Chakri dynasty, the claim that media consolidation was a core component of the conspiracy, the claim that the Plan was aimed at maintaining a constitutional monarchy while reducing the powers of the monarch to a mere figurehead, and the claim that a law designed to further decentralize central administrative power to the Thai provinces, and the claim that Thaksin wanted to establish a government based on the model of western democracies.\n\nAnother variation claimed that Thaksin's co-conspirators were former members of the Communist Party of Thailand including Deputy Transport Minister Phumtham Wechayachai and had applied a theory of orthodox Marxism to map out the TRT strategy to promote capitalism.  This variation claimed that Thailand during the 1970s was still a semi-feudal society and needed to become a capitalist society as part of the transition to socialism.  The communists then worked with Thaksin to fully develop Thailand's capitalist economic system, destroy all remnants of feudalism, and privatize state-owned assets, while at the same time establishing a single-party dictatorship, all in order to create a socialist dictatorship.\n\nThe allegations were roundly denied by Thaksin Shinawatra and the leadership of his Thai Rak Thai party, including Surapong Suebwonglee and Prommin Lertsuridej. \n\nOn 30 May, Thaksin Shinawatra and Thana Benjathikul, a lawyer from the Thai Rak Thai party, sued Sondhi, editor Khunthong Lorserivanich, columnist Pramote Nakhonthap, executive Saowalak Thiranujanyong, and webmaster Panjapat Angkhasuwan for libel.  The lawsuit alleged that the articles were intended to ruin Thai Rak Thai and Thaksin's political future by making the public believe the party was planning to overturn the constitutional monarchy.  Thaksin's lawsuit attracted criticism and claims that Thaksin was trying to censor the media.\n\nImpact of the allegations \n  \nThe allegations damaged the popularity of Thaksin and his government.  Thaksin was forced to expend a significant amount of time and political capital on damage control, explaining his position and swearing his loyalty to the monarchy.\n\nIn an editorial, the influential anti-Thaksin newspaper The Nation noted:\n\nThe Nation noted that the actual existence of the Plot was not important\u2014the mere invocation of royalty would be enough to damage the Thai Rak Thai party.  Many commentators noted the similarity between the Finland Plot allegations and the allegations used justify the massacre of students on 6 October 1976, which in the context of the Thailand political crisis, might justify a military coup.  The Thai military eventually successfully executed a coup against the Thaksin government on 19 September 2006.  One of the junta's stated rationales for the coup was that Thaksin had insulted the King.\n\nReferences \n\nPolitics of Thailand\nConspiracy theories in Asia\nConspiracy theories in Thailand\n2006 in Thailand\nCommunism in Thailand\nThaksin Shinawatra\nRepublicanism in Thailand\nHistorical events in Finland", "machine_text": "The Finland Plot, also known as the \"Tanner Affair,\" was a political scandal that took place in Finland during the 1950s. The plot involved accusations that a group of individuals, including the Finnish Prime Minister, Juho Kusti Paasikivi, and his successor, Karl-August Fagerholm, worked with the Soviet Union to maintain their power and influence in the Finnish government. The allegations were first made public by the Finnish Ambassador to Sweden, Max Jakobson, in a series of articles published in the Swedish press in 1954. Jakobson claimed that Paasikivi and Fagerholm had made a secret deal with Soviet officials during the Moscow Conference in 1952, in which they agreed to follow pro-Soviet policies in exchange for Soviet support. The accusations sparked a public outcry in Finland, with many demanding an investigation into the matter. The Finnish Parliament established a commission to investigate the allegations, and over the next few months, the commission heard testimony from a number of witnesses, including Jakobson, Paasikivi, and Fagerholm. In the end, the commission was unable to find any concrete evidence of a plot or conspiracy. However, the accusations had a significant impact on Finnish politics, damaging the reputations of Paasikivi and Fagerholm and contributing to a shift in Finnish foreign policy away from the Soviet Union. Today, the Finland Plot remains a controversial and divisive topic in Finnish politics and history. While some view it as a legitimate concern about Soviet influence in Finnish affairs, others see it as a politically motivated smear campaign against left-leaning politicians. Regardless of one's perspective, the Finland Plot serves as a reminder of the complex and often fraught relationship between Finland and its powerful neighbor to the east.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 7042983}

This space can be used to describe the orientation, position, and motion of objects in three-dimensional space. In this space, each direction can be represented by a vector, which has both magnitude and direction. These vectors can be added and subtracted to produce new vectors, which in turn represent new directions. The space of directions is commonly used in fields such as physics, geometry, and computer graphics. One of the key uses of directional space is in describing the motion of objects. By representing the direction of an object's velocity as a vector, it is possible to calculate its speed and direction of travel. This information is useful in fields such as aerospace engineering, where the trajectory of a spacecraft must be calculated accurately in order to arrive at a specific destination within our solar system. The space of directions can also be used to represent orientations of objects in three-dimensional space. By assigning a vector to each surface of an object, it is possible to describe the position and orientation of the object relative to other objects in the environment. This is used in fields such as computer-aided design, where engineers and designers need to visualize how parts fit together and move in space. In geometry, the space of directions is used to describe the set of all possible tangent vectors to a curved surface. These tangent vectors provide a way to calculate the curvature of the surface at each point, which is important in fields such as differential geometry and topology. In conclusion, the space of directions is a powerful and versatile mathematical concept that has many uses across a wide range of fields. Its ability to represent orientations, motion, and curvature makes it a valuable tool for researchers, scientists, and engineers seeking to understand and control the natural world.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 57702051}

The Georgia Constitution, like many other state constitutions, guarantees to its citizen the right to keep and bear arms. Article one, section one, paragraph VII of the Georgia Constitution states: \"The right of the People to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed, but the General Assembly shall have the power to prescribe the manner in which arms may be borne.\"\n\nSummary table\n\nOverview\nOn June 8, 2010, Senate Bill 308 was signed by Governor Sonny Perdue reforming and clarifying many of Georgia's Gun Laws, while leaving certain restrictions in place.\n\nGeorgia is a \"shall issue\" state, with the Georgia Weapon's Carry License application to be submitted through the probate court of the county of residence. Applicants must be at least 21 years of age, unless they provide proof of basic training and service in the military.\n\nAccording to the Georgia Department of Law, \"Georgia will recognize the weapons carry licenses, both resident and non-resident, from any other state provided that that state likewise recognizes a Georgia license.\" The states recognized under reciprocity include:  Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. A non-resident of Georgia to whom has been issued a firearm license by a state listed above may carry a firearm while in Georgia in accordance with Georgia law. This includes non-residents under the age of 21.\n\nSouth Carolina H3799 was signed by Gov Haley on June 3, 2016, allowing reciprocity with Georgia WCL licenses.\n\nThere are a number of ways a firearm can be carried without a permit. No permit is needed:\n To carry a firearm in a person's home, place of business, or vehicle\n To carry a long gun in a fully open and exposed manner\n To carry an unloaded firearm in a case\n To carry a firearm in someone else's vehicle, provided you would qualify for a permit\n To carry a firearm while fishing or hunting, if you have a valid fishing or hunting license\n\nState preemption laws prohibit localities from regulating the ownership, transportation, and possession of firearms. Georgia also has a law preventing localities from enacting ordinances or lawsuits to classify gun ranges as nuisances.  This means that local parks, offices, etc. of non-Federal government agencies may not prohibit those with a valid Georgia Weapons License from carrying.  Federal regulations continue to prohibit carrying weapons on Corps of Engineers and US Postal Service property.\n \n\nFirearm regulations are uniform throughout the state, and a firearms permit is valid throughout the state, in all areas other than in a few specially-defined areas. These specially-defined prohibited areas include:\nIn a government building, where ingress into such building is restricted or screened by security personnel and overseen by a POST certified, sworn peace officer\nIn a courthouse\nIn a jail or prison\nIn a place of worship, unless the governing body or authority of the place of worship permits the carrying of weapons or long guns by license holders\nIn a state mental health facility\nOn the premises of a nuclear power facility\nWithin  of any polling place, only during an election.\nOn school grounds (incl. building and grounds), unless carrying or picking up a student, or permitted in writing by an official of the school, however weapons may be securely stored in vehicles parked on school grounds.\n\nAs exceptions to the above list, a person may keep their firearm in a locked compartment of their vehicle at any of the above places except nuclear power facilities. Also, a person may approach security or management of any of the above places (except schools and nuclear power facilities) and ask them for directions on removing, securing, storing, or temporarily surrendering the weapon.\n\nAs of July 1, 2006, Georgia became a \"Stand Your Ground\" state, and requires no duty to retreat before using deadly force in self-defense, or defense of others.\n\nGeorgia law allows private firearm sales between residents without requiring any processing through an FFL.\n\nA Kennesaw, Georgia city ordinance requires that all homeowners own a firearm and ammunition (Sec 34-1a). No one has ever been charged with violating this ordinance. An amendment exempts those who conscientiously object to owning a firearm, convicted felons, those who cannot afford a firearm, and those with a mental or physical disability that would prevent them from owning a firearm.\n\nOn April 23, 2014, Georgia's gun laws were again revised when Governor Nathan Deal signed House Bill 60, the Safe Carry Protection Act. The Safe Carry Protection Act changed many of the currently enacted gun laws in place beforehand.\n\nIn 2017, the Georgia legislature passed HB 280, which allows for concealed carry permit holders to carry concealed handguns on public college campuses. Governor Nathan Deal signed it into law on May 4, 2017. The law took effect July 1, 2017 on all University System of Georgia Campuses, including universities, colleges, and trade schools under the University System.  Under HB280 any Georgia Weapons Licensee may carry on University System of Georgia property if they are carrying concealed.  They may not carry in any dormitory or Greek house owned by the University System, in any athletic venue used for intercollegiate sports, in any daycare facility on campus with limited entry (gated), in any classroom with a currently enrolled high school student, in any private office space, or in any room currently in use for disciplinary proceedings. HB280 does not remove the prohibition against carry on private university and college property under Georgia Law.\n\nSome counties have adopted Second Amendment sanctuary resolutions.\n\nCode Section 16-11-130(a)(3) exempts Active duty Military from laws concerning carry of weapons and prohibited carry locations (Code Sections 16-11-126 through 16-11-127.2) just as it does for law enforcement officers.

Georgia is known for having an overall permissive attitude towards gun ownership, reflected in its relatively lax gun laws. This has led to criticism from gun control advocates who argue that the state's lenient policies have contributed to a higher rate of gun violence in Georgia. Background and history Georgia's gun laws have a long and complex history dating back to the state's founding. The state's constitution includes a provision that explicitly guarantees the right to bear arms, which has been upheld by the courts. In recent years, the state has passed a number of laws that have expanded the rights of gun owners and NRA members. This has included measures like the \"stand your ground\" law, which allows the use of deadly force in certain situations, and the legalization of concealed carry in most public places. Current gun laws in Georgia Georgia is an open-carry state, which means that gun owners can openly carry firearms in most public places without a permit (with some exceptions). The state also permits concealed carry with a license, which requires a background check and firearms training. There are some gun-free zones in Georgia, including government buildings, schools, and certain businesses. Georgia also has a \"shall-issue\" law for concealed carry permits, which means that the state is required to issue a permit to anyone who meets the basic criteria (including passing a background check) unless they have a disqualifying criminal record or history of mental illness. The permit is valid for five years and must be renewed before it expires. Criticism and controversy Critics of Georgia's gun laws argue that they make it too easy for dangerous individuals to obtain firearms, which in turn contributes to a higher rate of gun violence in the state. Some advocates for gun control have called for stricter regulations on firearms ownership in Georgia, including expanded background checks, stricter licensing requirements, and tighter restrictions on concealed carry in public places. Conclusion Overall, Georgia's gun laws represent a balance between the Second Amendment right to bear arms and the need to protect public safety. While the state has some relatively permissive policies when it comes to gun ownership, it also has a number of regulations in place to help prevent dangerous and irresponsible use of firearms. As the debate over gun control continues in the United States, it is likely that Georgia's laws will continue to evolve and change over time.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 33969044}

He was Chief of the Astroparticle Physics Laboratory at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) from 1995 until his death, and was best known for his work developing the field from early balloon instruments to today's space observatories such as the NASA Swift mission, for which he was the Principal investigator. He was leading the WFIRST (now called the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope) wide-field infrared telescope forward toward a launch in the mid-2020s. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\nGehrels died on February 6, 2017, at the age of 64. On January 10th, 2018, NASA announced that Swift had been renamed the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, in his honor.\n\nEarly life and education \nGehrels was born in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, on October 3, 1952. His father was astronomer Tom Gehrels. He grew up near several telescopes including living at McDonald Observatory before his family settled in Tucson, Arizona, when he was 14, where he attended high school and then the University of Arizona as an undergraduate student. He received bachelor's degrees in music and physics from UofA in 1976. He received his Ph.D. in physics in 1982 from the California Institute of Technology, with advisor Edward C. Stone. He took a postdoctoral position at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in 1981 working with Bonnard J. Teegarden. In 1982, he became permanent at GSFC as an astrophysicist. \n\nIn 1980 while in graduate school, he married fellow graduate student Ellen Williams, who is a professor of physics at the University of Maryland and Director of ARPA-E at the Department of Energy. They have two children, Thomas (born 1987) and Emily (born 1990). Gehrels passed away of pancreatic cancer at the age of 64 on February 6, 2017.\n\nCareer \nGehrels was Chief of the Astroparticle Physics Laboratory at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center starting in 1995. He was the Principal Investigator for the Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission. Other responsibilities include: Project scientist for the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (1991\u20132000), Mission scientist for Mission INTEGRAL, Deputy Project Scientist for the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and Project scientist for the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, then known as the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST). He was also a professor at the University of Maryland College of Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences at University of Maryland and adjunct professor of astronomy and astrophysics at Pennsylvania State University. His research focused on transient objects in the universe such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), supernova and active galaxy flares. He worked to develop gamma-ray astrophysics from a field of experiments detecting a few objects to a full astronomical discipline with thousands of sources in many classes.\n\nHe was elected chair of the Astronomy Section of the National Academy of Sciences in 2013. He published over 600 academic articles, which have been cited 40,000 times for an h-index of 97. His most cited works include papers on the discovery of the origin of short gamma-ray bursts, the Swift satellite, Poisson statistics, observations of gamma-ray bursts at the edge of the visible universe, discovery of a relativistic tidal disruption event, and finding of two classes of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the gamma-ray band.\n\nResearch\n\nOverview \nGehrels was an astrophysicist with broad interests. He worked predominantly in the area of high energy astrophysics, studying explosive objects in the universe such as supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, gravitational wave transients and tidal disruption events (stars torn apart when they approach too close to a massive black hole). He was also a laboratory physicist developing instrumentation for space observation.\n\nGraduate studies \nGehrels' graduate schooling was at Caltech, working with advisors Rochus Vogt (1976\u20131979) and Edward C. Stone (1979\u20131981). The early period was spent performing laboratory and accelerator calibrations of the cosmic ray instrument on Voyager. The later years saw analysis of data from the instrument during the fly-bys of Jupiter (1979 for both Voyager 1 and 2). The elemental abundance of MeV particles in the Jovian magnetosphere was expected to be dominated by hydrogen and helium, so it was a surprise to find oxygen and sulfur dominant. This discovery was found to be related to the Voyager discovery of volcanoes on the moon Io spewing oxygen and sulfur into the magnetosphere. The Gehrels and Stone paper describing the measurement made a prediction, later confirmed, that the auroral emissions on Jupiter are cause by precipitating oxygen and sulfur ions.\n\nBalloon Observations of SN 1987A \nAs a postdoc and then permanent scientist at Goddard, Gehrels worked on the GRIS balloon payload for high resolution (germanium detector) spectroscopy of gamma-ray sources. He first was involved in the proposal to NASA for the instrument, specializing in the design and techniques for background reduction. The payload was nearing completion when Supernova 1987A was discovered. The construction was quickly finished and the instrument flown to observe the gamma-ray line emission from Co-56 decay. The GRIS detection of a broadened and redshift 847 keV line was some of the first strong evidence for mixing and asymmetries in the ejecta, now recognized as signature characteristics of supernova explosions.\n\nCompton Gamma Ray Observatory \nGehrels was the Project Scientist for the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory from its launch in 1991 to de-orbit in 2000. He followed Don Kniffen, who was Project Scientist during the development. The mission was one of the Great Observatories and provided the first comprehensive observations of the gamma-ray sky from 30 keV to 30 GeV. Discoveries include an isotropic distribution of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) on the sky, supporting an extragalactic origin, two classes of GRBs with short and long durations, blazars with bright gamma-ray emission and harder spectra than Seyfert AGN (e.g. Dermer & Gehrels 1995), detailed mapping of gamma-rays from Al-26 decay in the galactic plane mapping regions of nucleosynthesis over the past million years, and detailed mapping of the 511 keV line from positron annihilation in the galaxy with concentration at the galactic center. Gehrels, et al. (Nature, 2000) found a new population of mid-latitude high energy gamma-ray sources.\n\nSwift and Fermi observatories \nGehrels was the Principal investigator of the Swift mission and Deputy Project Scientist for the Fermi observatory. Swift is a three-instrument satellite launched in 2004 and designed to study GRBs and their afterglows. Since approximately 2009, it has become a community tool for observing transient and variable sources of all types including novae, supernova, AGN, magnetars, galactic black hole and neutron stars, tidal disruption events, and comets. Several requests are received per day. Gehrels led the Swift proposal, oversaw the development, and was chief scientist of the operations. Scientifically, he led several papers, including the discovery paper of short GRB afterglow and origin (Gehrels et al. Nature, 2005), and played a significant role in many others. The mission has characterized the afterglow and origin of short GRB for the first time, determine the shape of the X-ray and optical afterglow lightcurves to great precision and with large statistics (>1000 GRBs), provided a comprehensive data set of UV observation of supernova, and discovered X-ray outbursts from supernova shock breakouts and relativistically beamed tidal disruption events.\n\nFor Fermi, Gehrels worked with lead scientists at Goddard, Stanford, the United States Naval Research Laboratory, and several other institutions to propose the mission and bring it to fruition. He was Chair of the Senior Scientist Advisory Committee of the LAT instrument collaboration. Fermi scans the full sky every 3 hours in the high energy gamma ray band. It has revolutionized our understanding of the high energy gamma-ray sky with observations of pulsars, AGN, GRBs, novae, and diffuse emissions.\n\nWFIRST Era \nGehrels joined the SNAP dark energy mission proposal led by Saul Perlmutter and Michael Levi in 2008. This evolved in the DOE-NASA Joint Dark Energy Mission (JDEM) program, for which Gehrels became the Project scientist and chaired the Science Coordination Group in 2009. He led the proposal of JDEM to the 2010 Decadal Survey. This mission was combined with two other proposals to become the top ranked large mission WFIRST (now known as the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope). It is a wide-field infrared survey observatory. In 2012, NASA decided to use a donated  Hubble-class telescope for WFIRST and to add a coronagraph instrument to the primary wide-field infrared survey instrument. The mission is in development for launch in the mid-2020s. It will perform observations at Hubble depth and image resolution with 100 times the field of view of Hubble, and will make direct imaging and spectroscopic measurement of exoplanets. The science areas are dark energy/cosmology, exoplanets, and general astrophysics. The mission began Phase A development in 2016. Gehrels was the Project Scientist and chaired the Formulation Science Working Group with co-chairs Jeremy Kasdin and David Spergel.\n\nOther scientific work \nWorking at the conjunction of data analysis and theory, Gehrels wrote several papers of general interest:\n 1986 highly referenced paper on statistical confidence limits for small numbers of events, particularly in astrophysical data\n 1993 paper with Jack Tueller on the gamma-ray emission from the galactic ridge\n 1993 paper with wife Ellen Williams on temperatures of enhanced stability in hot thin plasmas\n 1993 Nature paper with Wan Chen on the Geminga supernova as a cause of the Local Bubble\n 1997 in Il Nuovo Cimento on the use of nu_Fnu spectral energy distributions\n 2003 paper with several co-authors on depletion of the Earth's ozone from nearby supernovae\n 2015 paper with John Cannizzo and several other co-authors on the galaxy observation strategy for follow-up observations of gravitational wave detections with large error regions on the sky\n\nAwards and honors \n 2017, Dan David Prize, astronomy (with Shrinivas Kulkarni and Andrzesj Udalski)\n 2016, Caltech Distinguished Alumni Award\n 2016, Milner Breakthrough Prize for LIGO gravitational wave discovery (Drever, Thorne, Weiss & LIGO Team)\n 2016, Physical Sciences Award, Washington Academy of Science\n 2016, Honorary Fellow, Royal Astronomical Society\n 2015, Asteroid 16000 Neilgehrels named in his honor\n 2012, Fellow, American Association for the Advancement of Science\n 2012, Alumnus of the Year, Honors College, University of Arizona\n 2012, Harrie Massey Award of COSPAR\n 2011, Member, International Academy of Astronautics\n 2010, Member, National Academy of Sciences\n 2009, George W.

Without the Fishbein convention, the usual way to counter it is to double the bid requesting partner to bid his strongest suit (i.e. a takeout double) or to bid notrumps to play.  The disadvantage of this approach is that a  of a weak opponent might be very profitable, and redefining the double as takeout would make this weapon unavailable. Fishbein's solution was to leave the double for penalties and, by convention, to bid the next suit up from that bid by the opening preemptor to ask for a takeout; the conventional bid can only be made by the opener's Left Hand Opponent (LHO). For example, if opener bids 3, LHO would bid 3 for takeout.  Over 3 LHO would bid 4; double would be for penalty and 3NT to play.\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n \n\nBridge conventions", "machine_text": "Fishbein Convention The Fishbein Convention is a mathematical model that aims to predict and measure consumer attitudes towards products and services. It was developed by Martin Fishbein, an American psychologist, in the 1960s. The model is widely used in marketing research to understand consumer behavior and to identify the factors that influence their purchase decisions. The Fishbein Convention is based on the belief that attitudes are a function of beliefs and evaluations. Consumers\u2019 attitudes towards a product or service can be predicted by measuring their beliefs about the product attributes and their evaluations of those attributes. The model assumes that individuals evaluate the attributes of a product or service based on their beliefs about the product attributes. The Fishbein Convention has two main components: the expectancy-value model and the multi-attribute model. The expectancy-value model predicts attitudes based on consumers\u2019 beliefs about the product attributes and the importance they place on each attribute. The multi-attribute model also considers the consumer\u2019s opinion about competing products or brands. The Fishbein Convention is a widely used research methodology and has been applied in a variety of fields, including health care, politics, and education. It allows researchers to conduct a comprehensive analysis of consumer attitudes towards a product or service. The model is widely recognized in marketing research, and its effectiveness has been demonstrated in numerous studies. The Fishbein Convention is particularly useful for quantitative research, such as surveys and experiments. It allows researchers to measure consumer attitudes towards a product or service and understand the factors that influence those attitudes. The model has also been used to design marketing strategies and to develop targeted advertising campaigns. In conclusion, the Fishbein Convention is a mathematical model that has become a common tool in marketing research. It is an effective method for predicting and measuring consumer attitudes towards products and services. Its application enables researchers to design marketing strategies that are tailored to particular customer attitudes.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 21873350}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Pennine Way\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Pennine Way is a National Trail in England, with a small section in Scotland. The trail stretches for  from Edale, in the northern Derbyshire Peak District, north through the Yorkshire Dales and Northumberland National Park and ends at Kirk Yetholm, just inside the Scottish border. The path runs along the Pennine hills, sometimes described as the \"backbone of England\". Although not the United Kingdom's longest National Trail (this distinction belongs to the  South West Coast Path), it is according to The Ramblers \"one of Britain's best known and toughest\".\n\nHistory\n\nThe path was the idea of the journalist and rambler Tom Stephenson, inspired by similar trails in the United States of America, particularly the Appalachian Trail. Stephenson proposed the concept in an article for the Daily Herald in 1935, and lobbied Parliament for the creation of an official trail. The walk was planned to end at Wooler but it was decided that Kirk Yetholm would be the finishing point. The final section was declared open in a ceremony held on Malham Moor on 24 April 1965. Before the official opening of the Pennine Way the British Army was invited to test the route, a task that was accomplished in one day. Junior soldiers from the Junior Tradesman's Regiment of the Army Catering Corps, based in Aldershot, were split into patrols of four or five and each was allocated an approximately  section of the walk. A report was then provided on the signage and route feasibility.\n\nThe Pennine Way celebrated its 50th anniversary in April 2015. A special four-part BBC One series The Pennine Way was broadcast throughout April.\n\nUsage\n\nThe Pennine Way is popular with walkers, and in 1990 the Countryside Commission reported that 12,000 long-distance walkers and 250,000 day-walkers were using all or part of the trail annually and that walkers contributed \u00a32\u00a0million (1990) to the local economy along the route, directly maintaining 156 jobs. The popularity of the walk has resulted in substantial erosion to the terrain in places, and steps have been taken to recover its condition, including diverting sections of the path onto firmer ground, and laying flagstones or duckboards in softer areas. The actions have been effective in reducing the extent of broken ground, though the intrusion into the natural landscape has at times been controversial.\n\nAccommodation is available at Youth Hostels, camp sites, B&Bs and pubs but are limited on upland stretches, so when planning the walk one must sometimes choose between a long day (between two places offering on-route accommodation) or two shorter days involving an evening descent off-route (to a nearby village or farm) with a morning re-ascent.\n\nThere are 535 access points where the Pennine Way intersects with other public rights of way. The route is crossed by many roads and passes through many villages and towns with good public transport. This makes it easy to sample a short section of the trail, or to split the Pennine Way across several holidays or long weekends.\n\nMost of the Pennine Way is on public footpaths, rather than bridleways, and not accessible to travellers on horseback or bicycle but a roughly parallel Pennine Bridleway is open from Derbyshire to Cumbria. This route, open to anyone not using motorised vehicles, starts slightly farther south than the Pennine Way.\n\nRoute\n\nA survey by the National Trails agency reported that a walker covering the entire length of the trail is obliged to navigate 287 gates, 249 timber stiles, 183 stone stiles and 204 bridges.  of the route is on public footpaths,  on public bridleways and  on other public highways. The walker is aided by the provision of 458 waymarks.\n\nPeak District National Park\n\nThe Pennine Way originally climbed north from Edale across the middle of the Kinder Scout plateau. It was rerouted to reduce erosion, and now heads west to climb onto the plateau by steps known as Jacob's Ladder. It then turns north to follow the western edge of the plateau past Kinder Downfall, crosses the Snake Pass road (A57) and climbs Bleaklow. From the summit the trail descends to Longdendale. In the dale it crosses the dam of Torside Reservoir to Crowden, the first village since the start of the trail  away.\n\nFrom Crowden the Pennine Way climbs a side valley past Laddow Rocks to the summit of Black Hill on the border of Yorkshire. It descends across Wessenden Head Moor (the eastern part of Saddleworth Moor) and the A635 road to the Wessenden Valley. It climbs out of the valley to leave the National Park at Standedge on the A62 road.\n\nSouth Pennines\n\nFrom Standedge the Pennine Way follows the Yorkshire\u2013Greater Manchester border north along a series of gritstone edges. It crosses the A640 road, then the A672, before crossing the M62 motorway by a long footbridge near Windy Hill. Past the motorway the trail follows Blackstone Edge to the A58 road, then passes a series of reservoirs. It crosses the Calderdale Way high above the village of Mankinholes, then climbs to the prominent monument on Stoodley Pike. From the monument it descends steeply to the valley of the River Calder, which it crosses about  west of the town of Hebden Bridge, the largest settlement near the route.\n\nThe trail climbs out of the Calder valley through the scattered hamlet of Colden, crossing Colden Water by an ancient clapper bridge. It then passes the Walshaw Dean Reservoirs and climbs to the ruins of Top Withens, said to have been the inspiration for Wuthering Heights. The trail then descends to Ponden Hall, and crosses more moorland to the villages of Cowling and Lothersdale.\n\nFrom Lothersdale the trail crosses Pinhaw Beacon to Thornton-in-Craven. There then follows gentler country, including a short section of the towpath of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal at East Marton, to reach the village of Gargrave in Airedale, on the busy A65.\n\nYorkshire Dales National Park\n\nNorth of Gargrave the Pennine Way ascends Airedale and enters the Yorkshire Dales National Park. It follows field paths, through the small villages of Airton and Hanlith to the larger village of Malham. It then climbs steps on the west side of Malham Cove, traverses the limestone pavement at the top of the cove, and continues north to Malham Tarn. The trail then crosses a shoulder of Fountains Fell, crosses the head of Silverdale and ascends the nose of Pen-y-Ghent in a very steep section. From the summit of Pen-y-Ghent the Pennine Way descends to the village of Horton in Ribblesdale (on the Settle\u2013Carlisle Railway).\n\nThe Pennine Way then heads up Ribblesdale along the old Settle\u2013Langstrothdale packhorse road. It passes the eastern end of Ling Gill and climbs Cam Fell, where it follows the line of a Roman road, shared with the Dales Way. The trail then passes Dodd Fell Hill and follows a ridge between Widdale and Sleddale, before descending into Wensleydale at Gayle and the adjoining town of Hawes.\n\nThe path crosses the dale to Hardraw, then begins the  ascent of Great Shunner Fell. From the summit of the fell the trail descends to upper Swaledale and the village of Thwaite. It then crosses the side of Kisdon, with good views down Swaledale, passes Kisdon Force, a waterfall on the River Swale, and reaches the village of Keld.\n\nFrom Keld the path crosses the route of the Coast to Coast Walk, then ascends a side valley known as Stones Dale to reach Tan Hill and its isolated inn at the northern boundary of the National Park.\n\nNorth Pennines\n\nAt Tan Hill the Pennine Way enters the North Pennines AONB and follows moorland tracks to the isolated settlement of Sleightholme, where the route divides. The main route heads directly north across the moors, crossing God's Bridge and passing beneath the A66 road in a tunnel. The alternative route enters the town of Bowes and rejoins the main route at Baldersdale. From Baldersdale the trail crosses Lunedale and descends to the small town of Middleton-in-Teesdale.\n\nFrom Middleton the path ascends Teesdale on the right bank of the River Tees, below the village of Holwick. It passes the waterfalls of Low Force and High Force, and reaches the scattered settlement of Forest-in-Teesdale. Further up the Tees, the path climbs beside the waterfall of Cauldron Snout below the dam of Cow Green Reservoir. The trail then ascends the gently rising side valley of Maize Beck to reach High Cup Nick, one of the most photographed areas on the Pennine Way. From High Cup the trail descends to the village of Dufton.\n\nFrom Dufton the Pennine Way climbs back up the fells, passing in turn the summits of Knock Fell, Great Dun Fell, Little Dun Fell and finally Cross Fell, at  the highest point on the entire path. Here, walkers can face tricky conditions in bad weather as a result of the Helm Wind which sweeps down the south-west slope of the escarpment. A long descent follows to the valley of the South Tyne at Garrigill. The trail then keeps close to the river to enter the town of Alston.\n\nThe trail continues down the valley of the South Tyne to Slaggyford and Knarsdale. Above the village of Lambley the trail leaves the valley to cross more moorland to the A69 near the village of Greenhead.\n\nNorthumberland National Park and the Scottish border\n\nOutside Greenhead the Pennine Way passes Thirlwall Castle on Hadrian's Wall. For the next  the route coincides with the Hadrian's Wall Path, following the wall closely past Once Brewed to Rapishaw Gap,  west of the Housesteads Roman Fort.\n\nFrom the wall the trail heads north through Wark Forest. Past the forest it follows field paths to Shitlington Crags and descends to the large village of Bellingham. More remote country follows, across Padon Hill and the edge of Redesdale Forest. The trail eventually reaches Redesdale at Blakehopeburnhaugh and Cottonshopeburnfoot, two neighbouring hamlets which compete for the longest name in England. The route then follows the River Rede upstream to the village of Byrness.\n\nThe last stage of the Pennine Way, across the Cheviot Hills from Byrness to Kirk Yetholm, is  long, with no habitation en route. It is usually tackled in one long day, although there are two refuge huts (or bothies). The trail climbs steeply from the village, then heads north to cross the Scottish border near Ogre Hill. For the rest of the stage the path switches between England and Scotland, along a fence which marks the border itself. Back in England the trail passes the Roman fort at Chew Green, and briefly follows the Roman road of Dere Street. The path then follows the border ridge, passing the high point of Windy Gyle. At the west top of Cairn Hill (), from where the path leads to the summit of The Cheviot and back down, the path turns sharply northwest with the border fence, descending to a refuge hut before climbing The Schil at , above the College Valley. The path then descends into Scotland and enters the village of Kirk Yetholm. The path ends at the Border Hotel.\n\nRecords\nThe record time for completion of the Pennine Way is 2 days, 10 hours, 4 minutes and 53 seconds, set by John Kelly on 15\u201317 May 2021. Kelly had previously held the record for just one week in July 2020 with a time of 2 days, 16 hours and 46 minutes, before this was broken by Damian Hall with a time of 2 days, 13 hours and 35 minutes. Before this, the record had been held for 31 years by Mike Hartley (time of 2 days, 17 hours and 20 minutes).\n\nThe fastest women's time is 3 days and 46 minutes, set by Anna Troup on 14\u201317 August 2021. The previous record of 3 days, 2 hours and 28 minutes was set by Sabrina Verjee on 12\u201315 September 2020.\n\nThe route of the Pennine Way is the basis of the Spine Race, which was inaugurated in 2012.\n\nFurther reading \n\nThe Pennine Way has attracted a number of writers over the years, including Stephenson, who wrote the first official guidebook. A popular guide was written and illustrated by the writer Alfred Wainwright, whose offer to buy a half-pint of beer for anyone who finished the Pennine Way is estimated to have cost him up to \u00a315,000 by his death in 1991. The National Trail Guide contains a description of the route, GPS waypoints and 1:25000 maps of the entire walk.\nBarry Pilton's book One Man and His Bog gives a more lighthearted and personal account of completing the Pennine Way, with a foreword by Mike Harding. Mark Wallington's book Pennine Walkies (in which the author is accompanied by his dog) is another humorous personal story of the walk, as is Walking Home by Yorkshire poet Simon Armitage, who walked north-to-south along the Pennine Way without money, relying on his 'earnings' from nightly poetry readings along the way. Movement artists Tamara Ashley and Simone Kenyon performed the entire length of the trail in August 2006; their book documents the performance and invites readers to create their own interpretations of the landscapes along the way.\n\nImage gallery\n\nSee also\nLong-distance footpaths in the United Kingdom\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nExternal links\n\nPennine Way Official Site\nPennine Way Association\nPractical information for the walk\nMap of the Pennine Way in  segments\nPennine Way Companion Related article published on Alfred Wainwright Books & Memorabilia\nThe Pennine Way Pint Related article published on Alfred Wainwright Books & Memorabilia\n\nLong-distance footpaths in the United Kingdom\nFootpaths in Northumberland\nFootpaths in the Scottish Borders\nFootpaths in West Yorkshire\nFootpaths in North Yorkshire\nFootpaths in Cumbria\nTourist attractions in County Durham\nPennines\nFootpaths in Derbyshire\nFootpaths in Yorkshire", "machine_text": "Pennine Way Pennine Way is a long-distance footpath in the United Kingdom that runs from the Peak District in the heart of England to the Scottish borders near Kirk Yetholm. It is considered one of the most challenging and iconic National Trails in Britain, spanning a distance of 268 miles (431 km) through some of the country's most beautiful and scenic landscapes. The Pennine Way was officially opened on April 24, 1965, by Tom Stephenson, who devised the route and campaigned tirelessly to create the path. The route was created as a way of allowing walkers to explore the majesty of the Pennines, the upland region that runs along the backbone of England. Its popularity and fame quickly spread, and it became known worldwide as a must-do hike for outdoor enthusiasts. The route passes through three National Parks \u2013 the Peak District, Yorkshire Dales, and Northumberland \u2013 and other areas of outstanding natural beauty such as the Upper Teesdale, the Cheviot Hills, and the Malham Cove limestone pavement. It offers walkers a unique opportunity to experience a range of landscapes from gentle rolling hills to wild, rugged terrain. The terrain and weather on the Pennine Way can be challenging, with steep ascents, boggy ground, and high winds. The route passes over several of the highest peaks in England, including Cross Fell and Pen-y-ghent, and also takes in the awe-inspiring landscapes of remote upland moors, deep valleys, and cascading waterfalls. The route can be undertaken in its entirety, taking approximately 18 to 20 days, or walkers can choose to tackle individual sections of the trail. There are a variety of accommodation options available along the path, from campsites and bunkhouses to hotels and bed and breakfasts. It is advisable to plan ahead and book accommodation in advance, particularly in peak season. The Pennine Way is managed by the National Trails, and there are many resources available for planning a trip, including guidebooks, maps, and online resources. The route is well signposted, but walkers should be prepared with appropriate equipment, food, and water, as well as a good level of fitness and experience. The Pennine Way is a challenging and rewarding trail that offers walkers the opportunity to explore the stunning landscapes of northern England. It provides a unique insight into the character and culture of the people who live and work in one of the most beautiful and rugged regions of Britain. For those who complete the route, the Pennine Way is a journey that will be treasured forever.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 319178}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"The Leveller\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Leveller was a British political magazine, 1976 to 1982, collectively produced by a shifting coalition of radicals, socialists, marxists, feminists, and others of the British left and progressive movements. It was published during the years of the Labour government of James Callaghan and the beginning of the era of the Conservative administration of Margaret Thatcher. This period was also noted for punk rock, Rock Against Racism and the Anti-Nazi League.\n \nThe Leveller was involved in a well-recorded contempt of court case in 1979, which concerned identifying Colonel B, an unnamed witness who had previously testified in a case involving British intelligence agencies and whose name the magazine  published in its January and March 1978 issues. Convictions under the Official Secrets Act 1911 were quashed on appeal to the House of Lords.\n   \nA statement frequently appearing in the magazine, which for most of its life appeared monthly, described it as \"An independent monthly socialist magazine produced by the Leveller Collective.  Owned by its Supporting Subscribers through the Leveller Magazine Ltd, a society whose AGM controls the magazine.\"\n\nMembers, who met for collective meetings initially in the Euston and Kings Cross areas of north London, and later in Brixton, included: Roger Andersen, Nick Anning, Julia Bard, Imogen Bloor, Dave Clark, Andy Curry, Brian Deer, Tim Gopsill, Cheryl Hicks, Terry Ilott, Phil Kelly, HO Nazareth, Mike Prest, Jane Root, Rose Shapiro, Russell Southwood, Dave Taylor, Adam Thompson, John Verner, Ian Walker. Steve Bell, the cartoonist, was a contributor.  The logo was designed by Bill Kocher, who lived in the same house as Dave Clark, and was asked to help with the first issue.\n\nA report on an annual general meeting of 21 July 1979, published in the September issue of that year, stated: \"Differences within the collective \u2013 for which we had hoped to look to the meeting for answers \u2013 remained unresolved. The basic difference is over the impact that writing personally about politics should have on the news, political analysis, and so on, that we print. The collective is still discussing it.\" That year a company, Leveller Magazine (1979) Limited, had been incorporated on 25 May 1979 to operate the magazine.\n\nInitially, the magazine was typeset by Bread 'n Roses Typesetters, who allowed Leveller workers to use their IBM Composers and trained them in typesetting. When Leveller bought a photosetting machine, Bread 'n Roses arranged to use it, bringing their floppy discs to the premises in Acre Lane, and later in Coldharbour Lane.

The group was named after their belief that all men were equal and that no one should be elevated above another based on rank, wealth, or status. They were active during the English Civil War, which was fought between Parliamentarians (including the Levellers) and Royalists from 1642 to 1651. The Levellers were influenced by the revolutionary philosophies of Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. They believed in the right to universal suffrage, freedom of speech, and the abolition of the monarchy and aristocracy. They sought to create a more democratic society where all individuals had equal rights, regardless of their social class or wealth. The Levellers were instrumental in developing the first proto-democratic political movements in the world. They were active in Parliament, where they created a manifesto entitled \u201cAn Agreement of the People,\u201d which called for equal representation, the protection of individual liberties, and electoral reform. The manifesto was not well received by Oliver Cromwell, who saw the Levellers as a threat to his rule. The Levellers also played a significant role in the Putney Debates of 1647, where they argued for the right of all men, including those not born into the nobility, to participate in government. They believed that the power of the state should rest primarily in the hands of the common people. Although the Levellers were influential in the development of modern democratic systems, their ideas were not fully realized in England until the 19th century. Their legacy, however, can still be seen today in modern political movements that advocate for equality, individual rights, and democratic participation.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 4646496}

They feed on multiple species and can be found in places such as the United States, Egypt, and Tunisia.\n\nDescription\nThe species appears black when viewed by the naked eye, but it appears brown when under a microscope. The head and thorax are dark brown while the abdomen is a lighter brown. Its wings are transparent, but they appear to be white when light reflects off their surface while they are folded on their back. Females are  long and the males are  long with a lighter brown than the females. It can be found in places such as the United States, Egypt, and Tunisia. The common name comes from Bodega Bay in California which is where the species was first studied; however, it was first found and scientifically named as Holoconops kerteszi in Cairo, Egypt, in 1908.\n\nHabitat and bites\nThis species breeds in the sand of lakes and marshes. Its breeding grounds are located at high tide in damp areas with no vegetation. Its larvae can be found in the first centimeter of its breeding ground in shallow sandy water. The adults feed on humans, domestic animals, and birds. Their bites cause swelling that progresses to exudation.\n\nStudy\nIn a 1967 study, a large amount of the gnats were caught with a portable gasoline-powered device that had its suction tube replaced with a metal funnel. The insect suction sampler was used to capture specimens that were flying around a person's head by having them drawn through a mesh net into the funnel. It was used to analyze adult gnat populations. An insect suction sampler is a device that entomologists use to suck up insects for studies.\n\nReferences\n\nkerteszi\nInsects described in 1908\nInsects of Egypt\nInsects of the United States\nInsects of North Africa", "machine_text": "Leptoconops kerteszi is a species of biting midge found in Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is commonly referred to as the Kertesz's biting midge. This species is known for its small size, measuring only 0.75 to 1.5 mm in length. The female Leptoconops kerteszi feeds on the blood of mammals, including humans, while the males feed on nectar. Taxonomy Leptoconops kerteszi was first described by Hungarian entomologist J\u00f3zsef Kert\u00e9sz in 1909. It belongs to the family Ceratopogonidae, which includes over 5,000 species of biting midges. The genus Leptoconops is composed of over 350 species of biting midges found worldwide. Distribution and habitat Leptoconops kerteszi is found throughout Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is commonly found in wetland areas, such as marshes and bogs, but can also be found in woodland areas. This species is known to be active during late spring and early summer. Behavior and ecology Leptoconops kerteszi is known for its biting behavior, which can be a nuisance to humans and animals. The female biting midges feed on the blood of mammals, including humans, while the males feed on nectar. This species is known to be a vector for several diseases, including bluetongue and Schmallenberg virus. Additionally, the bites from Leptoconops kerteszi can cause itching and discomfort, as well as allergic reactions in some individuals. Conservation Leptoconops kerteszi is not considered a threatened species. However, its populations may be impacted by habitat destruction, changes in climate, and pesticide use. Studies have shown that insecticides, specifically pyrethroids, can effectively control populations of biting midges, including Leptoconops kerteszi. However, the use of insecticides can also have negative impacts on non-target species and the environment. In conclusion, Leptoconops kerteszi is a small biting midge species found throughout Europe, Asia, and North Africa. While not threatened, this species can be a nuisance and vector for diseases. Conservation efforts should consider the use of insecticides and its impacts on non-target species and the environment.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 59367422}

Starting on 7 June at Oxford, the tour lasted for two months and ended in late July at The Oval. The Americans played 15 first-class matches captained by George Stuart Patterson. \n\nThe match the Philadelphians played against the MCC was to be Patterson's last first-class cricket match. The tour introduced American bowler J Barton King to the international cricketing world.\n\nTour results\n\nThis tour was a very ambitious one for the Americans. They had last toured the British Isles in 1889. Though the results may have been less satisfactory than hoped for by promoters, the tour was arranged mainly for educational purposes and few of those on the American side expected to win many matches. Previous tours had tended to involve amateur English sides with a relatively low level of competition. In 1897 a schedule was made including all of the top county cricket teams, the Oxford and Cambridge University teams, the Marylebone Cricket Club, and two other sides, though only a few of the counties thought it worthwhile to put their best elevens onto the field. While it initially aroused some curiosity, many English fans lost interest until Bart King and the Philadelphians met the full Sussex team at Brighton on 17 June. In the first innings, King proved his batting worth on a fourth-wicket stand of 107 runs with John Lester. He then took 7 wickets for 13 runs and the team dismissed Sussex for 46 in less than an hour. In the second innings, King took 6 for 102 and helped the Philadelphians to a victory by 8 wickets.\n\nDespite the excitement surrounding King's performance, the Americans did not fare well overall. Fifteen matches were played, but only two were won while the team lost nine and earned a draw on four. The other win of the tour came against Warwickshire. During this match King again shined by taking 5 for 95 and 7 for 72 and scoring 46 runs. According to the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack King proved himself to be the best bowler on the American side and had to do much of the work. He bowled three hundred overs more than anyone else. His average was just over 24 runs each for 72 wickets. In addition to his work bowling, King scored 441 runs with an average of just over 20. Captain George Patterson's best innings batting was 162 runs at Trent Bridge against Nottinghamshire.\n\nControversy\nHaving returned home from the tour, there were claims in the Philadelphia Public Ledger that the Philadelphians had been treated unfairly by the English umpires, but Patterson put those rumors to rest with a letter to the editor of an American newspaper:\nMy attention has been directed to a letter signed W.S. in the Field of July 24th, enclosing a clipping from the Philadelphia Public Ledger, severely criticising the umpiring in the Philadelphian matches during our tour through England. I wish to state on behalf of the Philadelphia team that the sentiments expressed in the clipping are not those of the team, and that we emphatically repudiate any insinuation of unfair treatment. On the contrary, we have been received with the most unvarying courtesy and fairness both on and off the field. I wish to take this opportunity of making a public acknowledgement of our indebtedness to Mr. Perkins, of the M.C.C., for the umpires assigned to us, and to testify, unnecessary though it be, to their ability and integrity.\nThe calming words from Patterson on the issue seem to have defused the situation in Philadelphia.\n\nSee also\n \nUnited States cricket team\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\n1897 in English cricket\nInternational cricket competitions from 1888\u201389 to 1918\nEnglish cricket seasons from 1890 to 1918\n1897\nUnited States cricket in the 19th century\nJune 1897 sports events\nJuly 1897 sports events", "machine_text": "The Philadelphian cricket team in England in 1897 was a tour undertaken by a team of cricketers from the United States to compete against various English teams.

The tour included matches against various English county teams, including Yorkshire, Surrey, and Oxford University, among others.

It was discovered by American astronomer reverend Joel Metcalf at Taunton, Massachusetts, USA, on 13 September 1907.\n\nThe S-type asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.7\u20133.7\u00a0AU once every 5 years and 9 months (2,103 days). Its orbit shows an eccentricity of 0.15 and is tilted by 7 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic. A photometric light-curve analysis from the 1980s and a provisional observation in 2004 rendered a rotation period of 32.6 and 34.4 hours, respectively.\n\nAccording to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite, IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite, and the U.S.Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, the asteroid has a dissimilar albedo in the range of 0.14 to 0.23, which leads to a varying estimate for its diameter from 28 to 36 kilometers. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link publishes an albedo of 0.23 from an alternative result of the Supplemental IRAS Minor Planet Survey (SIMPS) and derives a slightly lower diameter of 27.9 kilometers.\n\nThe minor planet was named for two women of ancient Roman history. Agrippina the Elder (14 BCE \u2013 33) was the daughter of the Roman statesman Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, the wife of Germanicus and the mother of the Emperor Caligula. Her daughter, Agrippina the Younger (15\u201359 AD) was the mother of Emperor Nero. The naming might be influenced by the two letters of the provisional designation 1907 AG. In the Dictionary of Minor Planet Names, Lutz Schmadel supposes that the name originated from a list of female names from mythology and history, compiled by the Astronomisches Rechen-Institut (ARI) in 1913. The ARI then sent this list to a number of astronomers with the request to name their discoveries in order to avoid confusion, as the number of unnamed minor planet up to number 700 had grown significantly at the time.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n Asteroid Lightcurve Database (LCDB), query form (info )\n Dictionary of Minor Planet Names, Google books\n Asteroids and comets rotation curves, CdR \u2013 Observatoire de Gen\u00e8ve, Raoul Behrend\n Discovery Circumstances: Numbered Minor Planets (1)-(5000) \u2013 Minor Planet Center\n \n \n\nBackground asteroids\nAgrippina\nAgrippina\nAgrippina\nS-type asteroids (Tholen)\n19070913", "machine_text": "645 Agrippina is a main-belt asteroid that was first discovered on November 11, 1907 by Finnish-Russian astronomer Heikki A. Alikoski from Turku Observatory. The asteroid was named after Agrippina the Younger, a Roman empress who was the mother of the Emperor Nero. The asteroid measures approximately 50 kilometers in diameter and orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.73 astronomical units (AU) once every 4.49 years. Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.181 and an inclination of 1.7\u00b0 with respect to the ecliptic. Interestingly, 645 Agrippina has a significantly brighter surface than most other asteroids of similar size and composition. This suggests that the asteroid may have a high albedo, which is a measure of how much light an object reflects compared to how much it absorbs. Recent studies of Agrippina\u2019s spectral data have shown that the asteroid\u2019s surface composition is consistent with a classification of a carbonaceous chondrite. These types of asteroids are some of the oldest and most primitive in the solar system and are believed to have formed during the early stages of the solar system's evolution. Due to its relatively large size, Agrippina is regularly observed by astronomers using ground-based telescopes and has been studied to learn more about its composition and other physical properties. In addition, several spacecraft missions have visited other asteroids of similar composition to Agrippina in recent years, providing additional insights into the early history of the solar system, as well as potential targets for future exploration.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 3032920}

This year is famous for many historic events that took place around the world. One of the most significant events that happened in 1520 is the fall of Tenochtitl\u00e1n. It was the capital city of the Aztec empire, located in present-day Mexico City. Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s, along with his army, invaded and conquered the city with the help of the local indigenous people. This event marked the end of the Aztec civilization and the start of Spanish domination in the region. In Europe, the year 1520 saw Martin Luther's excommunication from the Catholic Church. He had already published his famous 95 Theses, criticizing church officials and practices. The excommunication caused a split between Protestants and Catholics, leading to the Protestant Reformation. Meanwhile, in England, King Henry VIII took his first steps towards divorce from his wife, Catherine of Aragon. His desire to marry Anne Boleyn and produce a male heir led him to separate from the Catholic Church, thus paving the way for the establishment of the Church of England. In the field of arts and literature, the prominent Renaissance artist, Raphael, died in 1520 at the age of 37. His death was a great loss to the world of art and left a significant impact on the Italian Renaissance period. 1520 is also remembered for the famous meeting between two great emperors, Montezuma II of the Aztec empire, and Spanish King Charles V. However, the meeting ended in a tragic manner, and Montezuma was killed. In conclusion, 1520 was a year of significant change and events around the world. It played a vital role in shaping the course of history in Latin America, Europe, and the world, in areas of religion, politics, arts, and culture that are still being felt to this day.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 34888}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Native Dancer\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Native Dancer (March 27, 1950 \u2013 November 16, 1967), nicknamed the Gray Ghost, was one of the most celebrated and accomplished Thoroughbred racehorses in American history and was the first horse made famous through the medium of television. He was a champion in each of his three years of racing, and was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1963. In the Blood-Horse magazine List of the Top 100 Racehorses of the 20th Century, he was ranked seventh.\n\nAs a two-year-old, he was undefeated in his nine starts and was voted Horse of the Year in two of three major industry polls \u2013 One Count won the other. At age three, he suffered the sole defeat in his career in the 1953 Kentucky Derby, but rebounded to win the Preakness, Belmont and Travers Stakes. He made only three starts at age four before being retired due to injury, but was still named American Horse of the Year.\n\nRetired to stud in 1955, he became a major sire whose offspring included champion Raise A Native and dual Classic winner Kauai King. Also an influential broodmare sire, Native Dancer is now \"all but universal\" in modern pedigrees.\n\nBackground\nNative Dancer was bred by Alfred G. Vanderbilt Jr. and raced for him as a homebred. He was foaled at Scott Farm near Lexington, Kentucky but was raised at Vanderbilt's Sagamore Farm in Glyndon, Maryland, and is generally considered a Maryland-bred. Native Dancer was sired by the 1945 Preakness Stakes winner, Polynesian, who was otherwise known as a sprinter. His dam Geisha won only once in her eleven starts and produced no other stakes winners, though her daughter Orientation became a multiple stakes producer. Geisha was sired by Discovery, an outstanding distance horse and weight-carrier. Discovery was also the broodmare sire of leading sire Bold Ruler.\n\nNative Dancer inherited his gray coat, then quite rare in Thoroughbreds, through the female line to his fourth dam, La Grisette, a daughter of Roi Herode. Roi Herode was also the sire of The Tetrarch, the \"spotted wonder\". Most modern gray Thoroughbreds can trace their coat to Roi Herode and his grandsire Le Sancy.\n\nFrom his earliest days, Native Dancer was considered \"an extremely nice colt\". Ralph Kerchaval, the manager of Sagamore Farm, said that \"he was playful, big and rough, but you could do anything with him.\" At maturity, Native Dancer stood  at the withers. According to Charles Hatton of the Daily Racing Form, Native Dancer looked like a sprinter from the front and a stayer from the back. He was a massive horse with \"suspicious-looking ankles\". His pastern bones were short and somewhat too upright, making him more vulnerable to injury. He had a notably long stride but his action was hard and pounding. Trainer Bill Winfrey said the colt was \"a regular Jekyll and Hyde\" \u2013 ordinarily quiet and tractable but with a playful streak that could make him a handful.\n\nRacing record\n\n1952: two-year-old campaign\nIn his first season of racing, Native Dancer won all nine starts. He was voted the American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt for 1952, with two of the three major polls also naming him Horse of the Year.\n\nNative Dancer made his first start on April 19, 1952 in a maiden race at Jamaica Racetrack over five furlongs. Going off at odds of 7-5 in a field of nine, he settled into fourth place down the backstretch, then started a strong drive in the middle of the turn to win by  lengths. Just four days later, he returned in the Youthful Stakes where he was made the odds-on favorite in a field of twelve. He pressed a fast early pace set by Retrouve then pulled away in the stretch to win by six lengths. The victory established the colt as the early leader of the two-year-old division.\n\nNative Dancer was then given a layoff to recover from sore shins. He returned to racing on the opening day of Saratoga Race Course, August 4, in the Flash Stakes over  furlongs. Again the odds-on favorite, he was ridden hard around the turn before drawing away in the stretch to win by  lengths. On August 16, he entered the Saratoga Special, noteworthy at the time for having a winner-takes-all purse of $17,000. He won by  lengths over a muddy track. He followed up by winning the Grand Union Hotel Stakes on August 23, defeating two previously undefeated colts \u2013 Tahitian King and Lafango. He won by  lengths while running the fastest six furlongs at that year's Saratoga meeting, 1:11. He completed his dominance at Saratoga by winning the Hopeful Stakes on the meeting's closing day, August 31. Jockey Eric Guerin said, \"I never had a second of worry. He took off when I asked him to.\"\n\nNative Dancer made his next start on September 22 at Belmont Park in a six-furlong special weight race. He broke in fifth place in the field of six, then steadily improved his position to win by  lengths. Just five days later, he returned in the Belmont Futurity, then one of the most prestigious races for two-year-olds in the United States. He turned in a \"superlative performance\" to win while tying the world record for  furlongs, 1:14. He had been hard pressed though: Guerin admitted that he had thought the colt was beaten with an eighth of a mile remaining when he was headed by Tahitian King. But Native Dancer responded in the final furlong to open a  lead advantage. He became the first gray horse to win the race.\n\nNative Dancer made his final start as a two-year-old in the East View Stakes at Jamaica on October 22 over a distance of  miles. He won with ease, \"wiggling his ears and having much fun\" as he crossed the finish line  lengths ahead of Laffango, who had earlier won the Champagne Stakes. Guerin confirmed that Native Dancer had eased himself after taking the lead at the head of the stretch. \"He's not going to do any more than you make him do,\" he said. \"I never hit him with the whip.\"\n\nNative Dancer finished the year with nine wins, seven of them in stakes races, and earnings of $230,245, then a record for a two-year-old. He had been the odds-on favorite in all but his first start. He was named the American Champion Two-Year-Old. The Thoroughbred Racing Association also named him the American Horse of the Year, a \"break with tradition\" as two-year-olds are not normally considered for the award since they typically only race against horses of the same age. The Turf and Sports Digest, polling 176 sportswriters, also awarded him Horse of the Year honors However, the Daily Racing Form voted instead for One Count, winner of the Belmont and Jockey Club Gold Cup.\n\nHe was assigned 130 pounds in the Experimental Free Handicap, seven pounds ahead of Laffango and Tahitian King.\n\n1953: three-year-old campaign\nIn his three-year-old campaign, Native Dancer received a great deal of media attention leading up to the 1953 Kentucky Derby. He won the Gotham Stakes and the prestigious Wood Memorial, but in the 1953 Kentucky Derby, he lost for the only time in his career. Native Dancer subsequently won the Preakness, Belmont and Travers Stakes, a feat accomplished until then only by Duke of Magenta, Grenada, Man o' War and Whirlaway. Native Dancer finished the season with nine wins (all of them stakes races) from ten starts and was named Champion Three-Year-Old Colt.\n\nPreparing for the Triple Crown\nNative Dancer was given some time off at the end of his two-year-old campaign, then resumed training in California at Santa Anita Racetrack. He gave his connections a scare in late January when he threw his exercise rider after stumbling to his knees following a workout. He then bolted and was loose for five minutes, running into the paddock where he jumped some benches and ran through flower beds. When he tangled a leg in the reins, he finally slowed down enough to be recaptured. No serious damage was done.\n\nHe was shipped to New York in mid-March and made his first start of the year in the Gotham Stakes on April 18. As the race attracted 18 entries, it was run in two divisions, with Native Dancer the odds-on favorite is his division and Laffango the favorite in the second division. He raced in mid-pack during the early part of the race, then \"did a bit of hustling\" turning into the stretch to take the lead. He won under a hand ride by two lengths. Sportswriter George Ryall wrote, \"Any question in your mind about Native Dancer is easy to answer; he's as good as you thought.\"\n\nNative Dancer extended his winning streak to eleven in the Wood Memorial on April 25. Going off as the 1-10 favorite, he was restrained until the top of the stretch, then \"whizzed away\" from his rivals to win by  lengths over Tahitian King.\n\nThe Gotham and Wood Memorial were both televised by NBC. Native Dancer's gray coat helped him stand out on the black and white screens of the day, helping him to become the first TV star of the sport.\n\nKentucky Derby\nThe 1953 Kentucky Derby, held on May 2, was the sole loss of Native Dancer's career. He dominated news coverage leading up to the race and was the odds-on favorite. His main rival was supposed to have been Correspondent, who had won three straight, including the Blue Grass Stakes in which he set a track record. Dark Star won the Derby Trial a few days before the Derby but was largely dismissed by the bettors at odds of 25-1.\n\nDark Star, starting from the next-to-outside post position, went to the early lead and moved over to the rail. Native Dancer was eighth as they went down the stretch for the first time and was then bumped by longshot Money Maker as they entered the first turn. He started to make up ground on the final turn while racing wide, then was moved to the inside as he entered the stretch in third place. Still nearly three lengths behind, Guerin went to the whip and Native Dancer gradually closed ground. Dark Star held his position on the rail so Native Dancer was swung to the outside. He continued to edge closer with each stride but fell just short, losing by a head.\n\nIn addition to Native Dancer being fouled on the first turn, Guerin commented after the race that the colt had not cared for the track. However, Guerin was given a large share of the blame for the loss because of his racing tactics. One reporter wrote, \"he took that colt everywhere on the track except the ladies' room.\" Native Dancer was farther back than usual in the early part of the race, which resulted in more traffic problems. Instead of mounting a single drive on the outside, Guerin changed position several times in the final quarter of a mile, costing the colt momentum. Guerin later explained, \"He just didn't want to run early. And when he didn't want to run, he didn't run.\"\n\nTime magazine later reported, \"When he lost the Kentucky Derby by a head, thousands turned from their TV screens in sorrow, a few in tears.\" As a measure of Native Dancer's growing fame, Time added, \"Hundreds of people, old and young, have sent him letters and greeting cards. Little girls have organized fan clubs in his name.\"\n\nNative Dancer made his next start in the Withers Stakes on May 16 at Belmont Park. Facing only two other horses, he went off as the 1-20 favorite (the legal minimum) with win-only betting allowed. Native Dancer stumbled when leaving the starting gate but quickly recovered. He took a narrow lead about three furlongs from the finish and opened a significant margin around the eighth pole when Guerin flicked his whip. The final margin was four lengths.\n\nPreakness Stakes\nOn May 23, Native Dancer entered the Preakness Stakes as the 1-5 favorite. He again faced Dark Star, who set a fast early pace with Tahitian King to his outside. Native Dancer rated in fourth position on the rail, then started his move on the final turn, splitting between the two front runners. Tahitian King dropped back and eventually finished sixth. At the head of the stretch, Dark Star also gave way, leaving Native Dancer alone on the lead. However, longshot Jamie K then started to close ground rapidly. Guerin went to the whip and Native Dancer responded to win by a neck. Guerin admitted that he had been worried. \"When Dark Star stopped, I found myself in the lead a little sooner than I wanted,\" he said. It was later determined that Dark Star had bowed a tendon during the race: he never raced again.\n\nBesides being the odds-on favorite to win, Native Dancer was so heavily bet to show that it created a minus pool. A show bet pays if the horse finishes in the top three positions, and the legal minimum payout in Maryland at the time was $2.20 for a $2 bet. In order to cover the bets plus the associated taxes, the Maryland Jockey Club had to pay $46,012 () into the pool.\n\nThe trophy for the Preakness is the Woodlawn Vase, considered the most valuable trophy in sports with a value of roughly $4 million. Before 1954, the vase itself was given to the winning owner, who kept it for the following year. In 1954 though, Vanderbilt declined to take the original trophy home and instead was given a replica. This set a new tradition where the original Woodlawn Vase is displayed at Pimlico on Preakness day but otherwise resides at the Baltimore Museum of Art. Vanderbilt's replica trophy was sold at auction in 2018 for $100,000.\n\nBelmont Stakes\nNative Dancer was shipped to Belmont Park on May 24. He was walked the next two days to recover from the Preakness, then resumed galloping in the morning. He had several timed workouts in the interval leading up to the Belmont:  mile in 1:04 on May 30, a mile in 1:44 on June 1,  mile in 0:35 on June 4,  miles in 2:07 on June 5,  miles in 2:38 on June 9, and  mile in 1:13 on June 12. Training practices have since changed dramatically. For example, California Chrome had only one timed workout in the three weeks between the 2014 Preakness and Belmont.\n\nThe Belmont Stakes, run on June 13, was a similar race to the Preakness. Native Dancer was again the heavy favorite, and the New York Racing Association did not allow show betting. Ram o' War set the early pace with Native Dancer biding his time in fourth place around the first turn. He was tracked closely by Jamie K and the two horses started their move together on the final turn. Jamie K briefly took the lead as they entered the stretch, but Native Dancer fought back. The two colts dueled for the final furlong, with Native Dancer again prevailing by a neck. He completed the  miles in 2:28, then the third-fastest running of the race behind Count Fleet and Citation.\n\n\"He doesn't win in a flashy sort of a way,\" said Winfrey, \"but he keeps on winning. The Belmont is supposed to be 'the test of the champion' and if it is, he certainly answered the question.\"\n\nTo date, Native Dancer is one of only two \"dual Classic winners\" to come from the state of Maryland (the other being his son Kauai King, who won the 1966 Kentucky Derby and Preakness).\n\nSummer campaign\nWinfrey planned a busy summer campaign to keep his \"lazy so-and-so\" active. Native Dancer responded to the challenge, winning the Dwyer, Arlington Classic, Travers and American Derby in quick succession. On July 4, he went off as the 1-20 favorite in the Dwyer Stakes. He took the lead near the head of the stretch, \"loafed for a while, exerted himself just a bit in the final yards,\" and won by  lengths. Carrying 126 pounds, he conceded 10 pounds to each of his four rivals. Even though win-only betting was allowed, Native Dancer still created a small minus pool with a mandatory minimum payout of $2.10 for a $2 bet.\n\nNative Dancer then traveled to Chicago for the Arlington Classic, run over a distance of a mile on a heavy track on July 18. His main rivals were expected to be Jamie K and Van Crosby, who had equaled the track record for seven furlongs in his previous start. Native Dancer carried 128 pounds, conceding six pounds to each of his seven rivals. As expected, Van Crosby set the pace, but was run down by Native Dancer turning into the stretch. Native Dancer continued to draw away and won by nine lengths, the biggest margin of victory of his career. Longshot Sir Mango closed late for second; Jamie K was never a factor.\n\nOn August 15, Native Dancer made his next start in the prestigious Travers Stakes at Saratoga. He conceded six pounds to Dictar and twelve to the other three entrants. In the walking ring, he was surrounded by a throng of fans looking for photographs. \"It's the way people act when the president goes by in a parade,\" commented one man. Native Dancer maintained his calm. At the break, Fly Wheel took the early lead but soon dropped back. Guardian II then took over the lead for a few lengths before Dictar took command on the backstretch. Native Dancer bided his time until the  pole, then powered away to win by  lengths ahead of Dictar. Native Dancer again created minus pools in the win and place betting \u2013 show betting was not allowed.\n\nGuerin was suspended for an incident in another race and so missed Native Dancer's next start, the American Derby on August 22. Eddie Arcaro got the mount after the horse he had been scheduled to ride, Jamie K, was withdrawn from the race. Arcaro had previously questioned Native Dancer's credentials, saying, \"All the Dancer has done is go around beating the same horses, and most of the time carrying equal weight.\" He had also questioned the horse's soundness. After galloping him for the first time though, he said, \"He's a big, powerful animal. He handled well and had a good disposition.\"\n\nTravelling back to Chicago, Native Dancer went off as the 1-10 favorite in a field of eight in the American Derby on August 22. He settled near the back of the pack behind a fast early pace set by Sir Mango. Entering the far turn, Native Dancer moved to the outside and into fourth place. Without any urging, he surged forward rounding the far turn and won by two lengths. He completed the -mile race in 1:48, just one-fifth of a second off the track record. Arcaro believed that the colt could have broken the record if urged. \"But he was winning, so I didn't see any point in pressing him,\" he said. \"I let him run his own race.\" Despite the easy win, Arcaro still believed that Native Dancer had something to prove. He rated Citation as the best horse he had ever ridden.\n\nWhile Native Dancer was having a noteworthy campaign in the three-year-old division, Tom Fool was enjoying an equally brilliant one as a four-year-old. Racetracks began to alter stakes schedules and purses in hopes of having the two champions face off. For example, Pimlico increased the purse for the Pimlico Special to $50,000. Belmont Park followed suit by increasing the purse and changing the date of the Sysonby Stakes. The hopes for a race between the two died when several bruises were found on Native Dancer's left forefoot after the American Derby. He missed the rest of the year.\n\nNative Dancer was named champion three-year-old by all three major industry polls. However, in the Horse of the Year voting, he came second behind Tom Fool, who had won all ten of his starts.\n\n1954: four-year-old campaign\nIn 1954, Native Dancer won all three races he entered, including the Metropolitan Handicap. His connections hoped to complete the New York Handicap Triple, or perhaps race in Europe on the turf. However, Native Dancer was retired as a result of a recurring foot injury with a record of 21 wins out of 22 lifetime races.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1954, Native Dancer was in Maryland where he spent the winter at Sagamore Farm. By February, he was galloping three miles a day. He was then was shipped to New York in late March to resume training with Winfrey. He now faced a new challenge: as an older horse, he would be expected to carry high weight imposts in the handicap format pervasive at the time. His connections considered sending him to England to compete in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes if the weights got too high. Vanderbilt also discussed entering the colt in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in France.\n\nNative Dancer made his first start of the year in a six-furlong allowance race at Belmont Park on May 7. He went off at odds of 3-20 in a seven-horse field, with Laffango the second choice at 7-1. He raced in mid-pack for the first half-mile, then \"took the lead in about three huge strides.\" After hitting the front near the top of the stretch, Native Dancer relaxed but still won by  lengths.\n\nOn May 15, Native Dancer entered the Metropolitan Handicap, in which he was assigned 130 pounds \u2013 from 13 to 24 pounds more than his eight rivals. He raced further back than usual, trailing by ten lengths with a half mile remaining and still seven lengths back at the quarter pole. Down the stretch, Guerin hit him four times with the whip. Native Dancer \"answered the question\" and lengthened his stride. He closed steadily, getting his nose in front with just 30 yards remaining. He completed the mile in 1:35, then the second-fastest running of the race in its history.\n\nNative Dancer was supposed to make his next start in the Suburban Handicap, then part of the New York Handicap Triple (consisting of the Metropolitan, Suburban and Brooklyn Handicaps). However, after a workout in late May, he showed signs of lameness. Heating was found in the coronet band on his right fore, though X-rays showed nothing. Winfrey originally gave the colt a 50% chance of being fit for the Suburban. Native Dancer worked three furlongs on May 27 but pulled up lame. His connections ruled him out of the Suburban.\n\nNative Dancer finally returned to racing at Saratoga on August 16 in the Oneonta Handicap, run at a distance of seven furlongs over a sloppy track. He was assigned 137 pounds, conceding his rivals from 18 to 30 pounds. Even with the handicap, only two horses faced him so betting was not allowed. He won easily by nine lengths in 1:24, just  seconds off the track record despite the track conditions.\n\nHis next target was the Saratoga Cup but he showed signs of lameness after a 10-furlong workout on August 22, again in the right forefoot. Veterinarian William Wright diagnosed the problem as a \"bruised digital cushion, with a secondary inflammation of the bursae between the navicular and coffin bone.\" He was retired with a record of 21 wins from 22 starts, and earnings of $785,420, then fourth all-time behind Citation, Stymie and Armed.\n\nNative Dancer was voted the United States Horse of the Year for 1954, beating High Gun by 19 votes to 11 in the Daily Racing Form poll and winning the TRA award for the second time. He appeared on the May 31 cover of Time magazine. Many consider the \"Gray Ghost of Sagamore\" to have been the first Thoroughbred television star and TV Guide ranked him as a top icon of the era\".\n\nStatistics\n\nStud record\nAt stud, Native Dancer sired 43 stakes winners (or 44 according to one source) from 306 foals. His male-line descendants, particularly through his grandson Mr. Prospector, have dominated the US Triple Crown races. He is also the damsire of Northern Dancer, arguably the most influential stallion of the 20th century.\n\nAlthough Native Dancer never led the American sire list, he did finish second in 1966 and sixth in 1965. He was also second in the English sire list of 1963, and seventh in the French sire list of 1963.\n\nAmong Native Dancer's notable offspring are:\n Atan - sire of major sire Sharpen Up\n Dan Cupid \u2013 won Prix du Bois and other stakes races in France; sire of Sea-Bird (won Epsom Derby and Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe)\n Dancer's Image - won 1968 Kentucky Derby (disqualified)\n Exclusive Dancer - stakes winner and dam of General Assembly\n Gala Performance - won Jim Dandy Stakes: sire of steeplechasers, including West Tip, the winner of the 1986 Aintree Grand National and Monksfield.\n Good Move - won Selima Stakes etc.\n Hula Dancer - raced in France and England where her wins included the 1,000 Guineas\n Kauai King - won the 1966 Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes\n Natalma - dam of Northern Dancer\n Native Charger - won the 1965 Flamingo Stakes, Florida Derby\n Native Prince \u2013 won Great American Stakes etc.\n Native Street - multiple stakes wins including the 1966 Kentucky Oaks\n Protanto - multiple stakes wins including the 1971 Whitney Stakes\n Raise a Native - co-champion two-year-old colt of 1963. important sire of Majestic Prince, Alydar and leading sire Mr. Prospector, as well as Exclusive Native, who sired Affirmed and Genuine Risk\n Secret Step \u2013 won King George Stakes and July Cup etc. in England\n Shenanigans - 1975 Kentucky Broodmare of the Year. Dam of the champion filly Ruffian and influential sire Icecapade\n Street Dancer won Santa Ana Handicap etc.\n\nNative Dancer's bloodline is credited with creating \"precocious, speedy Thoroughbreds that dominate the Derby and other Triple Crown events.\" By 2008, every entrant in the Kentucky Derby was a descendant. However, he is also faulted for passing on his massive build and hard-pounding stride action, rendering many of his descendants vulnerable to injury. In the mid-2000s, there had been a troubling number of high profile breakdowns, including that of Barbaro (who was distantly related to Native Dancer through his dam.) As the grandsire of both Mr. Prospector and Northern Dancer, the two most important sires of the late twentieth century, a certain degree of inbreeding to Native Dancer became inevitable, potentially exacerbating the issue. \"There's a lack of durability right now,\" said Ric Waldman, the former head of operations for Windfields Farm. \"We're dealing with the law of diminishing returns.\" Vanderbilt's son Alfred G. Vanderbilt defended the stallion's legacy. \"All these great horses are not descended from him because he's fragile,\" he said. \"They're descended because he was a champion and he was durable.\"\n\nNative Dancer died on November 16, 1967, following the surgical removal of a tumor on the wall of the small intestine. He was buried at Sagamore Farm.\n\nHonors\n\nNative Dancer was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1963. He was inducted into the Maryland State Athletic Hall of Fame in 2014.\n\nIn the Blood-Horse magazine ranking of the top 100 U.S. thoroughbred champions of the 20th century, Native Dancer was ranked #7. In the Associated Press rankings of the greatest racehorses of the 20th century, he was ranked #3, tied with Citation, behind only Man o' War and Secretariat.\n\nIn August 2015, a statue of Native Dancer by Gwen Reardon was unveiled at Centennial Park in Saratoga Springs. The statue was donated to the city by Marylou Whitney and John Hendrickson. Native Dancer was undefeated in his six starts at nearby Saratoga Race Course.\n\nPedigree\n\nNative Dancer is shown as descending from (family 5-f), which traces back to the Bazajet Mare. However, the female descendants of his third-dam La Chica have a type of mitochondrial DNA that is inconsistent with other descendants of this family. As mitochondrial DNA is passed exclusively in the female line, this indicates a pedigree error occurred at some point between the Bazajet Mare's foaling in 1754 and La Chica's in 1930.\n\nSee also\nList of leading Thoroughbred racehorses\n\nReferences \n\n.\n.\n\n1950 racehorse births\n1967 racehorse deaths\nAmerican Thoroughbred Horse of the Year\nBelmont Stakes winners\nAmerican Champion racehorses\nPreakness Stakes winners\nRacehorses bred in Maryland\nRacehorses trained in the United States\nUnited States Champion Thoroughbred Sires\nUnited States Thoroughbred Racing Hall of Fame inductees\nThoroughbred family 5-f\nChefs-de-Race", "machine_text": "Native Dancer was a champion Thoroughbred racehorse, born on March 27, 1950, in Poland Spring, Maine, and was foaled by the mare Geisha. He was bred by Alfred G. Vanderbilt II, an American businessman, and owner of the Sagamore Farm in Maryland. Native Dancer is considered one of the greatest American racehorses of all time, winning 21 of his 22 career starts. Native Dancer's racing career began in January 1952, at Hialeah Park Race Track in Florida. He won his first start by nine lengths, and quickly became known for his distinctive grey coat and flashy running style. Native Dancer was known for his come-from-behind style, which often saw him trailing behind the pack before surging forward to take the lead in the homestretch. During his career, Native Dancer won many prestigious races, including the Gotham Stakes, Wood Memorial, Preakness Stakes, Belmont Stakes, and Dwyer Stakes. He was named American Horse of the Year in 1954 and was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1963. In addition to his racing success, Native Dancer also became a household name due to his widespread media coverage. He graced the cover of Time magazine in March 1954, and was featured in numerous films and television shows during his career. After retiring from racing in 1954, Native Dancer began a successful career as a breeding stallion. He sired several notable offspring, including Kauai King, who won the Kentucky Derby in 1966. Native Dancer died on November 16, 1967, at the age of 17.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 664610}

The systematic name of this enzyme class is holocytochrome-c apocytochrome-c-lyase (heme-forming). Other names in common use include cytochrome c heme-lyase, holocytochrome c synthetase, and holocytochrome-c apocytochrome-c-lyase.  This enzyme participates in porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism.\n\nCytochrome c haem-lyase (CCHL) and cytochrome Cc1 haem-lyase (CC1HL) are mitochondrial enzymes that catalyse the covalent attachment of a haem group on two cysteine residues of cytochrome c and c1. These two enzymes are functionally and evolutionary related. There are two conserved regions, the first is located in the central section and the second in the C-terminal section. Both patterns contain conserved histidine, tryptophan and acidic residues which could be important for the interaction of the enzymes with the apoproteins and/or the haem group.\n\nThe human enzyme, HCCS, processes both cytochromes c and c1.\n\nReferences\n\n \n\nEC 4.4.1\nEnzymes of unknown structure", "machine_text": "Holocytochrome-c synthase, also known as Hccs, is a protein found in mitochondria that is involved in the production of heme, a vital component of many enzymes including cytochrome c. Function Hccs is responsible for the final step of heme biosynthesis, which involves the insertion of a ferrous ion into protoporphyrin IX to form heme. Specifically, Hccs catalyzes the covalent attachment of a heme molecule to apocytochrome c to produce holocytochrome c. This process is essential for the proper functioning of the electron transport chain in mitochondria, which produces ATP, the primary energy source for cells. Structure Hccs is a multi-domain protein with a molecular weight of approximately 41 kilodaltons. It consists of a catalytic domain containing a heme-binding site and a membrane-spanning domain that anchors the protein in the mitochondrial inner membrane. Mutations Mutations in the Hccs gene have been linked to X-linked dominant chondrodysplasia punctata, a rare genetic disorder characterized by abnormal bone and cartilage development, as well as cataracts and intellectual disability. These mutations may prevent proper heme synthesis and lead to the accumulation of toxic intermediates, contributing to the development of the disease. Inhibitors Several small molecules have been identified as potential inhibitors of Hccs, including triphenyltin and isoniazid. These inhibitors have shown promise as therapeutic agents for the treatment of cancer and tuberculosis, respectively. Conclusion Holocytochrome-c synthase plays a crucial role in heme biosynthesis and mitochondrial function. Mutations in the Hccs gene can lead to serious health problems, while inhibitors of the protein may hold therapeutic potential for a variety of diseases. Despite ongoing research in this field, further investigation is needed to fully understand the function and potential of this important enzyme.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 14246404}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Battle of Yongsan\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Battle of Yongsan was an engagement between United Nations Command (UN) and North Korean forces early in the Korean War from September 1\u20135, 1950, at Yongsan in South Korea. It was part of the Battle of Pusan Perimeter and was one of several large engagements fought simultaneously. The battle ended in a victory for the UN after large numbers of United States Army (US) repelled a strong Korean People's Army (KPA) attack.\n\nDuring the nearby Second Battle of Naktong Bulge, the KPA broke through the US 2nd Infantry Division lines along the Naktong River. Exploiting this weakness, the KPA 9th and 4th Divisions attacked to Yongsan, a village east of the river and the gateway to the UN lines of supply and reinforcement for the Pusan Perimeter. What followed was a fight between KPA and US forces for Yongsan.\n\nThe KPA were able to briefly capture Yongsan from the 2nd Infantry Division, which had been split in half from the penetrations at Naktong Bulge. Lieutenant General Walton Walker, seeing the danger of the attack, brought in the US Marine Corps 1st Provisional Marine Brigade to counterattack. In three days of fierce fighting, the Army and Marine forces were able to push the KPA out of the town and destroy the two attacking divisions. The win was a key step toward victory in the fight at the Naktong Bulge.\n\nBackground\n\nPusan Perimeter \n\nFrom the outbreak of the Korean War and the invasion of South Korea by the North, the KPA had enjoyed superiority in both manpower and equipment over both the Republic of Korea Army (ROK) and the UN forces dispatched to South Korea to prevent it from collapsing. The KPA tactics were to aggressively pursue UN forces on all avenues of approach south and to engage them aggressively, attacking from the front and initiating a double envelopment of both flanks of the unit, which allowed the KPA to surround and cut off the opposing force, which would then be forced to retreat in disarray, often leaving behind much of its equipment. From their initial June 25 offensive to fights in July and early August, the KPA used these tactics to effectively defeat any UN force and push it south. However, when the UN forces, under the Eighth United States Army, established the Pusan Perimeter in August, the UN troops held a continuous line along the peninsula which KPA troops could not flank, and their advantages in numbers decreased daily as the superior UN logistical system brought in more troops and supplies to the UN forces.\n\nWhen the KPA approached the Pusan Perimeter on August 5, they attempted the same frontal assault technique on the four main avenues of approach into the perimeter. Throughout August, the KPA 6th Division, and later the KPA 7th Division, engaged the US 25th Infantry Division at the Battle of Masan, initially repelling a UN counteroffensive before countering with battles at Komam-ni and Battle Mountain. These attacks stalled as UN forces, well equipped and with plenty of reserves, repeatedly repelled KPA attacks. North of Masan, the KPA 4th Division and the US 24th Infantry Division sparred in the Naktong Bulge area. In the First Battle of Naktong Bulge, the KPA division was unable to hold its bridgehead across the river as large numbers of US reserve forces were brought in to repel it, and on August 19, the KPA 4th Division was forced back across the river with 50 percent casualties. In the Taegu region, five KPA divisions were repulsed by three UN divisions in several attempts to attack the city during the Battle of Taegu. Particularly heavy fighting took place at the Battle of the Bowling Alley where the KPA 13th Division was almost completely destroyed in the attack. On the east coast, three more KPA divisions were repulsed by the ROK at P'ohang-dong during the Battle of P'ohang-dong. All along the front, the KPA troops were reeling from these defeats, the first time in the war their tactics were not working.\n\nSeptember push \n\nIn planning its new offensive, the KPA command decided any attempt to flank the UN force was impossible thanks to the support of the UN naval forces. Instead, they opted to use frontal attack to breach the perimeter and collapse it; this was considered to be the only hope of achieving success in the battle. Fed by intelligence from the Soviet Union, the North Koreans were aware of the UN forces building up along the Pusan Perimeter and that they must conduct an offensive soon or they could not win the battle. A secondary objective was to surround Taegu and destroy the UN units in that city. As part of this mission, the KPA would first cut the supply lines to Taegu.\n\nOn August 20, the KPA commands distributed operations orders to their subordinate units. The plan called for a simultaneous five-prong attack against the UN lines. These attacks would overwhelm the UN defenders and allow the KPA to break through the lines in at least one place to force the UN forces back. Five battle groupings were ordered. The center attack called for the KPA 9th, 4th, 2nd and 10th Divisions to break through the US 2nd Infantry Division at the Naktong Bulge to Miryang and Yongsan.\n\nBattle \n\nOn the morning of September 1 the 1st and 2nd Regiments of the KPA 9th Division, in their first offensive of the war, stood only a few miles short of Yongsan after a successful river crossing and penetration of the US line. The 3rd Regiment had been left at Inch'on, but division commander Major General Pak Kyo Sam felt the chances of capturing Yongsan were strong.\n\nAs the KPA 9th Division approached Yongsan, its 1st Regiment was on the north and its 2nd Regiment on the south. The division's attached support, consisting of one 76\u00a0mm artillery battalion from the KPA I Corps, an anti-aircraft battalion of artillery, two tank battalions of the KPA 16th Armored Brigade, and a battalion of artillery from the 4th Division, gave it unusually heavy support. Crossing the river behind it came the 4th Division, a greatly weakened organization, far understrength, short of weapons, and made up mostly of untrained replacements. A captured KPA document referred to this grouping of units that attacked from the Sinban-ni area into the Naktong Bulge as the main force of KPA I Corps. Elements of the 9th Division reached the hills just west of Yongsan during the afternoon of September 1.\n\nOn the morning of September 1, with only the shattered remnants of E Company at hand, the US 9th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division had virtually no troops to defend Yongsan. Division commander Major General Laurence B. Keiser in this emergency attached the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion to the regiment. The US 72nd Tank Battalion and the 2nd Division Reconnaissance Company also were assigned positions close to Yongsan. The regimental commander planned to place the engineers on the chain of low hills that arched around Yongsan on the northwest.\n\nNorth Korean attack \nA Company, 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion, moved to the south side of the Yongsan-Naktong River road; D Company of the 2nd Engineer Battalion was on the north side of the road. Approximately  west of Yongsan an estimated 300 KPA troops engaged A Company in a fire fight. M19 Gun Motor Carriages of the 82nd AAA Battalion supported the engineers in this action, which lasted several hours. Meanwhile, with the approval of the Assistant Division Commander Brigadier General Joseph S. Bradley, D Company moved to the hill immediately south of and overlooking Yongsan. A platoon of infantry went into position behind it. A Company was now ordered to fall back to the southeast edge of Yongsan on the left flank of D Company. There, A Company went into position along the road; on its left was C Company of the Engineer battalion, and beyond C Company was the 2nd Division Reconnaissance Company. The hill occupied by D Company was in reality the western tip of a large mountain mass that lay southeast of the town. The road to Miryang came south out of Yongsan, bent around the western tip of this mountain, and then ran eastward along its southern base. In its position, D Company not only commanded the town but also its exit, the road to Miryang.\n\nThe KPA had also approached Yongsan from the south. The US 2nd Division Reconnaissance Company and tanks of the 72nd Tank Battalion opposed them in an intense fight. In this action, Sergeant First Class Charles W. Turner of the Reconnaissance Company particularly distinguished himself. He mounted a tank, operated its exposed turret machine gun, and directed tank fire which reportedly destroyed seven KPA machine guns. Turner and this tank came under heavy KPA fire which shot away the tank's periscope and antennae and scored more than 50 hits on it. Turner, although wounded, remained on the tank until he was killed. That night KPA soldiers crossed the low ground around Yongsan and entered the town from the south.\n\nThe KPA now attempted a breakthrough of the Engineer position. After daylight, they were unable to get reinforcements into the fight since D Company commanded the town and its approaches. In this fight, which raged until 11:00, the engineers had neither artillery nor mortar support. D Company remedied this by using its new 3.5-inch and old 2.36-inch rocket launchers (Bazookas) against the KPA infantry. The fire of the 18 Bazookas plus that from machine guns and the small arms of the company inflicted very heavy casualties on the KPA, who desperately tried to clear the way for a push eastward to Miryang. Tanks of A and B Companies, 72nd Tank Battalion, at the southern and eastern edge of Yongsan shared equally with the engineers in the intensity of this battle. The company commander was the only officer of D Company not killed or wounded in this melee, which cost the company 12 men killed and 18 wounded. The edge of Yongsan and the slopes of the hill south of the town became covered with KPA dead and destroyed equipment.\n\nReinforcements \nWhile this battle raged during the morning at Yongsan, commanders reorganized about 800 men of the 9th Infantry who had arrived in that vicinity from the overrun river line positions. Among them were F and G Companies, which were not in the path of major KPA crossings and had succeeded in withdrawing eastward. They had no crew-served weapons or heavy equipment. In midafternoon September 2, tanks and the reorganized US 2nd Battalion, 9th Infantry, attacked through A Company, 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion, into Yongsan, and regained possession of the town at 15:00.  Later, two Bazooka teams from A Company, 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion, knocked out three T-34 tanks just west of Yongsan. US ground and air action destroyed other KPA tanks during the day southwest of the town. By evening the KPA had been driven into the hills westward. In the evening, the 2nd Battalion and A Company, 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion, occupied the first chain of low hills  beyond Yongsan, the engineers west and the 2nd Battalion northwest of the town. For the time being at least, the KPA drive toward Miryang had been halted. In this time, the desperately undermanned US units began to be reinforced with Korean Augmentees (KATUSAs) However, the cultural divide between the KATUSAs and the US troops caused tensions.\n\nAt 09:35 September 2, while the KPA were attempting to destroy the engineer troops at the southern edge of Yongsan and clear the road to Miryang, Eighth United States Army commander Lieutenant General Walton Walker spoke by telephone with Major General Doyle O. Hickey, Deputy Chief of Staff, Far East Command in Tokyo. He described the situation around the Perimeter and said the most serious threat was along the boundary between the US 2nd and 25th Infantry Divisions. He described the location of his reserve forces and his plans for using them. He said he had started the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade, under Brigadier General Edward A. Craig, toward Yongsan but had not yet released them for commitment there and he wanted to be sure that UN commander General of the Army Douglas MacArthur approved his use of them, since he knew that this would interfere with other plans of the Far East Command. Walker said he did not think he could restore the 2nd Division lines without using them. Hickey replied that MacArthur had the day before approved the use of the Marines if and when Walker considered it necessary. A few hours after this conversation, at 13:15, Walker attached the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade to the US 2nd Division and ordered a co-ordinated attack by all available elements of the division and the Marines, with the mission of destroying the KPA east of the Naktong River in the 2nd Division sector and restoring the river line. The Marines were to be released from 2nd Division control as soon as this mission was accomplished.\n\nSeptember 3 counterattack \n\nA conference was held that afternoon at the US 2nd Division command post attended by leaders of the Eighth Army, US 2nd Division, and 1st Marine Brigade. A decision was reached that the Marines would attack west at 08:00 on September 3 astride the Yongsan-Naktong River road;  the 9th Infantry, B Company of the 72nd Tank Battalion, and D Battery of the 82d AAA Battalion would attack northwest above the marines and attempt to re-establish contact with the US 23rd Infantry Regiment; the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion, remnants of the 1st Battalion, 9th Infantry and elements of the 72nd Tank Battalion would attack on the left flank, or south, of the Marines to reestablish contact with the 25th Division. Eighth Army now ordered the US 24th Infantry Division headquarters and the US 19th Infantry Regiment to move to the Susan-ni area,  south of Miryang and  east of the confluence of the Nam River and the Naktong River. There it was to prepare to enter the battle in either the 2nd or 25th Division zone.\n\nThe troops holding this line on the first hills west of Yongsan were G Company, 9th Infantry, north of the road running west through Kogan-ni to the Naktong; A Company, 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion, southward across the road; and, below the engineers, F Company, 9th Infantry. Between 03:00 and 04:30 September 3, the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade moved to forward assembly areas. The 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines assembled north of Yongsan, the 1st Battalion, 5th Marines south of it. The 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines established security positions southwest of Yongsan along the approaches into the regimental sector from that direction.\n\nDuring the night, A Company of the engineers had considerable fighting with KPA and never reached its objective. At dawn September 3, A Company attacked to gain the high ground which was part of the designated Marine line of departure. The company fought its way up the slope to within  of the top, which was held by the firmly entrenched KPA. At this point the company commander caught a KPA-thrown grenade and was wounded by its fragments as he tried to throw it away from his men. The company with help from Marine tank fire eventually gained its objective, but this early morning battle for the line of departure delayed the planned attack.\n\nThe Marine attack started at 08:55 across the rice paddy land toward KPA-held high ground  westward. The 1st Battalion, 5th Marines, south of the east\u2013west road, gained its objective when KPA soldiers broke under air attack and ran down the northern slope and crossed the road to Hill 116 in the 2nd Battalion zone. Air strikes, artillery concentrations, and machine gun and rifle fire of the 1st Battalion now caught KPA reinforcements in open rice paddies moving up from the second ridge and killed most of them. In the afternoon, the 1st Battalion advanced to Hill 91.\n\nNorth of the road the 2nd Battalion had a harder time, encountering heavy KPA fire when it reached the northern tip of Hill 116,  west of Yongsan. The KPA held the hill during the day, and at night D Company of the 5th Marines was isolated there. In the fighting west of Yongsan Marine armor knocked out four T-34 tanks, and KPA crew members abandoned a fifth. That night the Marines dug in on a line  west of Yongsan. The 2nd Battalion had lost 18 killed and 77 wounded during the day, most of them in D Company. Total Marine casualties for September 3 were 34 killed and 157 wounded. Coordinating its attack with that of the marines, the 9th Infantry advanced abreast of them on the north.\n\nSeptember 4 counterattack \nJust before midnight, the 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines, received orders to pass through the 2nd Battalion and continue the attack in the morning.  That night torrential rains made the troops miserable and lowered morale. The KPA were unusually quiet and launched few patrols or attacks. The morning of September 4, the weather was clear.\n\nThe counterattack continued at 08:00 September 4, at first against little opposition. North of the road the 2nd Battalion quickly completed occupation of Hill 116, from which the KPA had withdrawn during the night. South of the road the 1st Battalion occupied what appeared to be a command post of the KPA 9th Division. Tents were still up and equipment lay scattered about. Two abandoned T-34 tanks in excellent condition stood there. Tanks and ground troops advancing along the road found it littered with KPA dead and destroyed and abandoned equipment. By nightfall the counterattack had gained another .\n\nThat night was quiet until just before dawn. The KPA then launched an attack against the 9th Infantry on the right of the Marines, the heaviest blow striking G Company. It had begun to rain again and the attack came in the midst of a downpour. In bringing his platoon from an outpost position to the relief of the company, Sergeant First Class Loren R. Kaufman encountered an encircling KPA force on the ridge line. He bayoneted the lead scout and engaged those following with grenades and rifle fire. His sudden attack confused and dispersed this group. Kaufman led his platoon on and succeeded in joining hard-pressed G Company. In the ensuing action Kaufman led assaults against close-up KPA positions and, in hand-to-hand fighting, he bayoneted four more KPA soldiers, destroyed a machine gun position, and killed a mortar crew. US artillery fire concentrated in front of the 9th Infantry helped greatly in repelling the KPA in this night and day battle.\n\nSeptember 5 counterattack \nThat morning, September 5, after a 10-minute artillery preparation, the American troops moved out in their third day of counterattack. It was a day of rain. As the attack progressed, the marines approached Obong-ni Ridge and the 9th Infantry neared Cloverleaf Hill where they had fought tenaciously during the First Battle of Naktong Bulge the month before. There, at midmorning, on the high ground ahead, they could see KPA troops digging in. The Marines approached the pass between the two hills and took positions in front of the KPA-held high ground.\n\nAt 14:30 approximately 300 KPA infantry came from the village of Tugok and concealed positions, striking B Company on Hill 125 just north of the road and east of Tugok. Two T-34 tanks surprised and knocked out the two leading Marine M26 Pershing tanks. Since the destroyed Pershing tanks blocked fields of fire, four others withdrew to better positions. Assault teams of B Company and the 1st Battalion with 3.5-inch Bazookas rushed into action, took the tanks under fire, and destroyed both of them, as well as an armored personnel carrier following behind. The KPA infantry attack was brutal and inflicted 25 casualties on B Company before reinforcements from A Company and supporting Army artillery and Marine 81\u00a0mm mortars helped repel it.\n\nSeptember 5 was a day of heavy casualties everywhere on the Pusan Perimeter. Army units had 102 killed, 430 wounded, and 587 missing in action for a total of 1,119 casualties. Marine units had 35 killed, 91 wounded, for a total of 126 battle casualties. Total American battle casualties for the day were 1,245 men. It is unknown how many KPA were killed or wounded on that day, but they likely suffered heavy casualties.\n\nNorth Koreans repulsed \nDuring the previous night, at 20:00 September 4, General Walker had ordered the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade released from operational control of the 2nd Division effective at midnight, September 5. He had vainly protested against releasing the brigade, believing he needed it and all the troops then in Korea if he were to stop the KPA offensive against the Pusan Perimeter. At 00:15, September 6, the Marines began leaving their lines at Obong-ni Ridge and headed for Pusan. They would join the 1st Marine Regiment and 7th Marine Regiment in forming the new 1st Marine Division. This was done after a heated disagreement between Walker's command and MacArthur's command. Walker said he could not hold the Pusan Perimeter without the Marines in reserve, while MacArthur said he could not conduct the Inchon landings without the Marines. MacArthur responded by assigning the US 17th Infantry Regiment and later the US 65th Infantry Regiment to Walker's reserves, but Walker did not feel the inexperienced troops would be effective. Walker felt the transition endangered the Perimeter at a time when it was unclear if it would hold.\n\nThe American counteroffensive of September 3\u20135 west of Yongsan, according to prisoner statements, resulted in one of the bloodiest debacles of the war for a KPA division. Even though remnants of the KPA 9th Division, supported by the low strength KPA 4th Division, still held Obong-ni Ridge, Cloverleaf Hill, and the intervening ground back to the Naktong on September 6, the division's offensive strength had been spent at the end of the American counterattack. The KPA 9th and 4th divisions were not able to resume the offensive.\n\nAftermath \nThe KPA 4th and 9th Divisions were almost completely destroyed in the battles at Naktong Bulge. The 9th Division had numbered 9,350 men at the beginning of the offensive on September 1. The 4th Division numbered 5,500. Only a few hundred from each division returned to North Korea after the Second Battle of Naktong Bulge. The majority of the KPA troops had been killed, captured or deserted. The exact number of KPA casualties at Yongsan is impossible to determine, but a substantial amount of the attacking force was lost there. All of KPA II Corps was in a similar state, and the KPA, exhausted at Pusan Perimeter and cut off after Inchon, was on the brink of defeat.\n\nThe US casualty count at Yongsan is also difficult to know, as the division's scattered units were engaged all along the Naktong Bulge without communication and total casualty counts in each area could not be ascertained. The US 2nd Infantry Division suffered 1,120 killed, 2,563 wounded, 67 captured and 69 missing during its time at the Second Battle of Naktong Bulge. This included about 180 casualties it suffered during the First Battle of Naktong Bulge the previous month. American forces were continually repulsed but able to prevent the KPA from breaking the Pusan Perimeter. The division had numbered 17,498 on September 1, but was in excellent position to attack despite its casualties. The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade suffered 185 killed and around 500 wounded during the Battle of Pusan Perimeter, most of which probably occurred at Yongsan.\n\nOnce again the fatal weakness of the KPA had cost it victory after an impressive initial success-its communications and supply were not capable of exploiting a breakthrough and of supporting a continuing attack in the face of massive air, armor, and artillery fire that could be concentrated against its troops at critical points. By September 8, the KPA attacks in the area had been repulsed.\n\nReferences\n\nCitations\n\nSources \n\n \n\nBattle of Pusan Perimeter\nConflicts in 1950\n1950 in Korea\nBattles of the Korean War\nBattles involving North Korea\nBattles involving South Korea\nBattles of the Korean War involving the United States\nSeptember 1950 events", "machine_text": "The Battle of Yongsan was a significant conflict that occurred in Seoul, South Korea during the Korean War. The battle began on June 10, 1951, and lasted for four days until June 14. Yongsan was a crucial location during the war since it was the site of the headquarters of the Eighth United States Army, which was responsible for the command and control of all American military operations in Korea. The North Korean and Chinese forces hoped that capturing Yongsan would be a significant blow to the US-led forces and adversely impact their efforts to win the war. The battle began with a massive artillery barrage and the movement of several divisions of North Korean and Chinese forces towards the Yongsan area. Despite the initial strength of the attack, the US-led forces were able to hold their ground and fight back fiercely. Over the course of the next few days, intense fighting raged in and around Yongsan with both sides losing significant numbers of men. The US-led forces were able to call in reinforcements, and with the support of tanks, artillery, and air support, they were able to slowly repel the enemy forces. The battle ended on June 14 when the North Koreans and Chinese were forced to retreat after suffering significant losses. The victory came at a high cost to the US-led forces, with over 500 men killed or wounded. The Battle of Yongsan was a significant turning point in the Korean War, as it marked the first time that North Korean and Chinese forces had launched a major attack after the destruction of Seoul in 1950. The successful defense of Yongsan demonstrated the strength and determination of the US-led forces and helped to boost morale among their troops. Today, Yongsan remains an important location in South Korea, serving as the site of the headquarters for the United States Forces Korea.

He was later appointed as the commander of the Scottish expeditionary force sent to help the Protestant King Henry IV of France in his war against the Catholic League. Moray was known for his bravery and was highly respected by both his fellow soldiers and his enemies. He was also a skilled diplomat, and played an important role in the negotiations leading up to the Treaty of Berwick between England and Scotland in 1586.

The album was released on September 22, 2017 through the band's own record label, Artemisia Records. The album was produced collaboratively with Randall Dunn and recorded primarily in their own recording studio Owl Lodge in Olympia, Washington, which the Weaver brothers built themselves, with the drums recorded at Studio Litho in Seattle. Thrice Woven received generally favourable reviews from music critics upon its release.\n\nBackground \nThrice Woven is the first black metal album by Wolves in the Throne Room since 2011's Celestial Lineage, which the band consider the final chapter in a trilogy of albums comprising Two Hunters, Black Cascade, and Celestial Lineage. The band regard their 2014 ambient album Celestite as being a companion piece to Celestial Lineage, rather than a successor, and have also stated categorically that Thrice Woven is not connected with the previous records; as a result, Thrice Woven can be considered the band's first 'true' album since 2011. It is also the first album recorded almost entirely in the band's home studio Owl Lodge, and is their first album to feature new permanent band-member Kody Keyworth on guitars and vocals.\n\nRecording, production \nThe album was recorded almost entirely at the band's home studio, Owl Lodge, in Olympia, Washington. The band recorded the drums at Litho Studio in Seattle with Jack Shirley. According to Aaron Weaver, \"Once we finished the drums, we brought the sessions back to our studio in Olympia, Randall Dunn showed up and we kind of made a plan on how to put the record together.\" He also explained that \"Me and Nathan would work by ourselves, tracking guitars, synthesizers, whatever then Randall would show up and kind of check it out and give suggestions. He tracked a lot of stuff too \u2014 he always plays a little bit of synthesizer on our records. Once all the tracking was wrapped up, we met up with Randall again in Seattle and mixed at Avast! Studio\". In a separate interview, Aaron Weaver explained that \"About halfway through recording, we realized it was time to invite Kody Keyworth to be a full member of the band. He'd been playing guitar on the road with us for six years. As we were recording Thrice Woven, we just realized that Kody's got to be on this record \u2014 he's a part of this band from now on.\" As a result, Keyworth \"added flavor to Thrice Woven but was uninvolved in the initial work on these songs.\"\n\nMusical style, writing \nThrice Woven has been described as significantly more aggressive and traditionally black metal than many of the band's previous albums, and both critics and the band themselves have noted the role of new guitarist Kody Keyworth in the album's sound. NPR Music wrote that the album's opening track \"recalls the WITTR of Two Hunters and Black Cascade, but is immediately bolder, with a newfound ferocity that feels untethered to the past.\" Decibel noted that the album \"is defined in a good deal of traditionalism, specifically second-wave black metal traditionalism.\" AllMusic's Thom Jurek likewise noted that \"Thrice Woven re-engages with blackness, full signature riffs, epic tunes, and tales of pagan nature worship that established Wolves in the Throne Room's identity. This is a return to the pummeling, multi-layered power that made 2009's Black Cascade a masterpiece.\"\n\nRelease, promotion, marketing \nWolves in the Throne Room announced the initial details (including the track listing, release date, and album cover) of Thrice Woven on June 28, 2017, along with a brief teaser trailer. On July 17, the band premiered their first ever music video for the song \"Born from the Serpent's Eye\", featuring the first half of the nearly 10-minute piece. According to the band, \"We lit a bonfire and blasted through the first third of our song Born From The Serpent\u2019s Eye. [sic] This is the first time we\u2019d played the song with new guitarist Kody Keyworth and it fucking slayed. Peter and Nico captured the magic. May the good fires blaze!\u201d On August 21 the band premiered the song \"Angrboda\" in full as part of Adult Swim's Singles 2017 series. On September 11, they also premiered the song \"Mother Owl, Father Ocean\" as a companion piece to the previously released \"Angrboda\". The album was officially released on September 22, 2017 through the band's own record label Artemisia Records.\n\nTouring \nThe band have announced they will tour the United States throughout Fall 2017 with Pillorian from September 29 to October 25. They have also announced a European tour from November 15 to December 15, 2017 with support from Aluk Todolo and Wiegedood.\n\nCritical reception \n\nThrice Woven was met with generally positive reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 76, based on 14 reviews, which indicates \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\nCritics generally noted the considerably more aggressive and traditionally black metal approach of the album, particularly compared to the band's previous records. The A.V. Club wrote that \"Not since acclaimed debut Diadem Of 12 Stars has Wolves In The Throne Room rocked this hard and steady; in its sustained racket, it approximates one of the band\u2019s live shows, which tend to be all blistering blitzkrieg all the time, drone passages withheld\", but noting that \"this being a WITTR record, the fury comes in crashing waves, emerging monstrously from stretches of placid calm\" Decibel named the album 'Best New Noise' and praised Thrice Woven as \"a return to the glories of old\", highlighting the strength of the songwriting in particular.\n\nTrack listing\n\nPersonnel\n\nWolves in the Throne Room \n Nathan Weaver \u2014 vocals, guitars\n Aaron Weaver \u2014 drums, synthesizers\n Kody Keyworth \u2014 guitars, vocals\n\nAdditional musicians \n Don McGreey \u2014 acoustic guitar (on track 1)\n Steve Von Till \u2014 vocals, acoustic guitar (on track 2)\n Anna Von Hausswolff \u2014 vocals (on tracks 1 and 4)\n Phil Petrocelli \u2014 percussion (on track 4)\n Zeynep Oyku Yilmaz \u2014 grand harp (on track 4)\n\nTechnical and additional personnel \n Randall Dunn \u2014 production, engineering\n Jason Ward \u2014 mastering\n Jack Shirley \u2014 engineering\n William Smith \u2014 additional engineering\n Denis Forkas Kostromitin \u2014 artwork\n John Westrock \u2014 photography\n\nReferences \n\n2017 albums\nWolves in the Throne Room albums\nBlack metal albums by American artists", "machine_text": "Thrice Woven is the fifth studio album released by the American black metal band Wolves in the Throne Room.

The album consists of five tracks, all of which showcase the band's signature blend of atmospheric black metal and ambient music. The album opens with \"Born from the Serpent's Eye,\" a nine-minute track that sets the tone for the rest of the album with its slow-building atmosphere and vivid imagery. \"The Old Ones Are with Us\" and \"Angrboda\" are both mid-tempo tracks that feature haunting melodies and intricate guitar work. The album's centerpiece is the nearly 12-minute-long \"Mother Owl, Father Ocean,\" which begins with an eerie soundscape and builds to a powerful crescendo of distorted guitars and thunderous drums. The album concludes with \"Fires Roar in the Palace of the Moon,\" a somber and reflective track that brings the album to a satisfying close. Thrice Woven was well-received by critics, many of whom praised the album's epic scope and emotional depth. The album charted on a number of Billboard's charts, including the Heatseekers Chart and the Independent Albums chart.

It was built between 1897 and 1899 to defend the area stretching from Delimara Point to Xrobb l-G\u0127a\u0121in. It formed part of a new series of fortifications meant to house breech-loading (BL) guns. The 18th century Tombrell Battery was demolished in the 19th century to clear Wolseley Battery's line of fire.\n\nThe battery has an oval plan with four gun emplacements, which originally contained two 9.2 inch and two 6 inch BL guns. The gun emplacements are surrounded by a shallow ditch, which was originally defended by barbed wire entanglements. The rear of the battery was sealed off by an iron fence. The battery also had machine gun emplacements, and it was the first fortification in Malta to have these features.\n\nWolseley Battery became obsolete by 1906, and its 6-inch guns were transferred to the newly built Wardija Battery near St. Paul's Bay in 1915. The battery was fully decommissioned a year later in 1916.\n\nA stone-clad pillbox was built behind the officers' quarters in the 1930s.\n\nPresent day\nToday, the battery still exists, but there is no public access since it is private property. It is located close to the Delimara Power Station.\n\nIn 2015, the battery was shortlisted as a possible site for the campus of the proposed American University of Malta.

The battery was constructed by the Canadian government in 1885 as part of its efforts to suppress the M\u00e9tis rebellion led by Louis Riel. The Wolseley Battery was made up of two Gatling guns and two 7-pounder guns, which were operated by a crew of 38 men, including Lieutenant-Colonel George T. Denison, who was in command of the battery. The soldiers stationed at the battery were part of the Quebec-based Royal Canadian Artillery and were supported by a company of infantry under the command of Major-General Frederick Middleton. The battery was located approximately 30 miles northeast of the town of Wolseley, overlooking the north branch of the Qu\u2019Appelle River. On April 4, 1885, the M\u00e9tis and their Aboriginal allies launched a surprise attack on the Wolseley Battery, seeking to capture the guns and disrupt the Canadian military\u2019s advance towards Batoche, the stronghold of the M\u00e9tis rebellion in the Saskatchewan region. The M\u00e9tis and Aboriginal fighters were led by Gabriel Dumont, who had gained experience in combat during the Red River Rebellion of 1869\u201370. Despite initial success in disarming some of the Canadian artillerymen and forcing the remainder to retreat, the M\u00e9tis were eventually repulsed by the arrival of Canadian infantry reinforcements and retreated towards Batoche. The Wolseley Battery is considered an important landmark in Canadian military history, as it was one of the sites where the Canadian military demonstrated its effectiveness in suppressing Indigenous resistance to colonial expansion in the late 19th century.

He was fatally shot on March 31, 1870 in Eutaw, the county seat. The Klan members apparently intended to hang him in the square in a public lynching, to demonstrate their power during this period and their threat to Republicans.\n\nBoyd fiercely resisted their taking him from his hotel room. In the armed confrontation, he was shot and killed there. As was typical of most Klan attacks, his murderers were never brought to justice. That same night, prominent black Republican James Martin was shot and killed at his home in Union, Alabama, also in Greene County.\n\nEarly life\nBoyd was born in South Carolina, and later lived in Alabama. He was among thousands of Klan victims who were killed or wounded in Alabama and other Southern states during the Reconstruction era. The Klan's primary targets were freedmen and free blacks from the North, but they also attacked and intimidated white Republican officeholders, teachers, and other freedman sympathizers.\n\nSimilarly, the Greene County Courthouse was burned in 1868, and some suspect it was arson to destroy such records of suits by freedmen against planters.\n\nDeath\nOn the night of Boyd's murder, thirty masked, armed, and costumed Klansmen were observed riding into the town square of Eutaw, the county seat of Greene County. A number of the men entered George Cleveland's hotel and demanded to be shown to Boyd's room. Boyd put up unexpected resistance and a gunfight broke out. He was wounded and left the room, and was fatally shot in the hallway. It is believed that he was attacked to prevent prosecution of suits by freedmen against planters. That same night, James Martin, a black Republican prominent in the county, was shot by gunmen near his home in Union, Alabama, who took him away rather than let him be treated; he was never seen again.\n\nAftermath\nIn the fall of 1870 before elections, two black politicians were killed in Greene County. An estimated four blacks were killed by whites in the Eutaw riot, which took place in the town square.\n\nPresident Ulysses S. Grant gained congressional passage of the 1870 Enforcement Acts, intended to authorize the federal government to suppress Klan violence.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Pornographic film\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Pornographic films (pornos), erotic films, or sex films are films that present sexually explicit subject matter in order to arouse and satisfy the viewer. Pornographic films present sexual fantasies and usually include erotically stimulating material such as nudity (softcore) and sexual intercourse (hardcore). A distinction is sometimes made between \"erotic\" and \"pornographic\" films on the basis that the latter category contains more explicit sexuality, and focuses more on arousal than storytelling; the distinction is highly subjective.\n\nPornographic films are produced and distributed on a variety of media, depending on the demand and technology available, including traditional film stock in various formats, home video, DVDs, Internet download, cable TV, in addition to other media. Today, pornographic films are sold or rented on DVD; shown through Internet streaming, special channels and pay-per-view on cable and satellite; and viewed in rapidly disappearing adult theaters. By law, they are generally not permitted to be shown in mainstream cinemas, or on free-to-air television.\n\nFilms with risqu\u00e9 content have been produced since the invention of motion picture in the 1880s. Production of such films was profitable, and a number of producers began to specialize in their production. Various groups within society considered such depictions immoral, labeled them \"pornographic\", and attempted to have them suppressed under obscenity laws, with varying degrees of success. Such films continued to be produced, and could only be distributed by underground channels. Because the viewing of such films carried a social stigma, they were viewed at brothels, adult movie theaters, stag parties, at home, in private clubs, and also at night cinemas.\n\nIn the 1970s, during the Golden Age of Porn, pornographic films were semi-legitimized; by the 1980s, pornography on home video achieved wider distribution. The rise of the Internet in the late 1990s and early 2000s changed the way pornographic films are distributed, complicating censorship regimes around the world and legal prosecutions of \"obscenity\".\n\nClassification\n\nPornographic films are typically categorized as either softcore or hardcore pornography. In general, softcore pornography is pornography that does not depict explicit sexual activity, sexual penetration or extreme fetishism. It generally contains nudity or partial nudity in sexually suggestive situations. Hardcore pornography is pornography that depicts penetration or extreme fetish acts, or both. It contains graphic sexual activity and visible penetration. A pornographic work is characterized as hardcore if it has any hardcore content.\n\nPornographic films are generally classified into subgenres which describe the sexual fantasy which the film and actors attempt to create. Subgenres can also be classified into the characteristics of the performers or the type of sexual activity on which it concentrates and not necessarily on the market to which each subgenre appeals. The subgenres usually conform to certain conventions, and each may appeal to a particular audience.\n\nHistory\n\nEarly years: 20th century\n\nProduction of erotic films commenced almost immediately after the invention of the motion picture. Two of the earliest pioneers were Frenchmen Eug\u00e8ne Pirou and Albert Kirchner. Kirchner (under the name \"L\u00e9ar\") directed the earliest surviving erotic film for Pirou. The 7-minute 1896 film  had Louise Willy performing a bathroom striptease. Other French filmmakers also considered that profits could be made from this type of risqu\u00e9 films, showing women disrobing.\n\nAlso in 1896 Fatima's Coochie-Coochie Dance was released as a short nickelodeon kinetoscope/film featuring a gyrating belly dancer named Fatima. Her gyrating and moving pelvis was censored, one of the earliest films to be censored. At the time, there were numerous risque films that featured exotic dancers. In the same year, The May Irwin Kiss contained the very first kiss on film. It was a 47-second film loop, with a close-up of a nuzzling couple followed by a short peck on the lips (\"the mysteries of the kiss revealed\"). The kissing scene was denounced as shocking and obscene to early moviegoers and caused the Roman Catholic Church to call for censorship and moral reform - because kissing in public at the time could lead to prosecution. Perhaps in defiance and \"to spice up a film\", this was followed by many kiss imitators, including The Kiss in the Tunnel (1899) and The Kiss (1900). A tableau vivant style was used in short film The Birth of the Pearl (1901) featuring an unnamed long-haired young model wearing a flesh-colored body stocking in a direct frontal pose that provides a provocative view of the female body. The pose is in the style of Botticelli's The Birth of Venus.\n\nIn Austria, cinemas organised men-only theatre nights (called ) at which adult films were shown. Johann Schwarzer formed his Saturn-Film production company which between 1906 and 1911 produced 52 erotic productions, each of which contained young local women fully nude, to be shown at those screenings. Before Schwarzer's productions, erotic films were provided by the Path\u00e9 brothers from French produced sources. In 1911, Saturn was dissolved by the censorship authorities which destroyed all the films they could find, though some have since resurfaced from private collections. There were a number of American films in the 1910s which contained female nudity in film.\n\nBecause Pirou is nearly unknown as a pornographic filmmaker, credit is often given to other films for being the first. In Black and White and Blue (2008), one of the most scholarly attempts to document the origins of the clandestine 'stag film' trade, Dave Thompson recounts ample evidence that such an industry first had sprung up in the brothels of Buenos Aires and other South American cities by the turn of the 20th century, and then quickly spread through Central Europe over the following few years. However, none of these earliest pornographic films are known to have survived. According to Patrick Robertson's Film Facts, \"the earliest pornographic motion picture which can definitely be dated is \" made in France in 1908. The plot depicts a weary soldier who has a tryst with a servant girl at an inn. The Argentinian , whose original title could have been  (The Satyr), might be even older; it has been dated to somewhere between 1907 and 1912. He also notes that \"the oldest surviving pornographic films are contained in America's Kinsey Collection. One film demonstrates how early pornographic conventions were established. The German film  (1910) is a ten-minute film which begins with a woman masturbating alone in her bedroom, and progresses to scenes of her with a man performing straight sex, fellatio and anal penetration.\"\n\n1920s\u20131940s suppression\nPornographic movies were widespread in the silent movie era of the 1920s, and were often shown in brothels. Soon illegal, stag films, or blue films, as they were called, were produced underground by amateurs for many years starting in the 1940s. Processing the film took considerable time and resources, with people using their bathtubs to wash the film when processing facilities (often tied to organized crime) were unavailable. The films were then circulated privately or by traveling salesmen, but anyone caught viewing or possessing them risked a prison sentence.\n\n1950s: home movies \nThe post-war era saw technological developments that further stimulated the growth of a mass market and amateur film-making, particularly the introduction of the 8 mm and super-8 film gauges, popular for the home movie market.\n\nEntrepreneurs emerged to meet the demand. In Britain, in the 1950s, Harrison Marks produced films which were considered risqu\u00e9, and which today would be described as \"soft core\". In 1958, as an offshoot of his magazines, Marks began making short films for the 8mm market of his models undressing and posing topless, popularly known as \"glamour home movies\". To Marks, the term \"glamour\" was a euphemism for nude modeling/photography.\n\n1960s: Europe and United States\nOn the European continent, sex films were more explicit. Starting in 1961, Lasse Braun was a pioneer in quality colour productions that were, in the early days, distributed by making use of his father's diplomatic privileges. Braun was able to accumulate funds for his lavish productions from the profit gained with so-called loops, ten-minute hardcore movies which he sold to Reuben Sturman, who distributed them to 60,000 American peep show booths. Braun was always on the move, and made his hardcore movies in a number of countries, including Spain, France, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands.\n\nIn December 1960, American female director Doris Wishman began producing a series of eight pornographic films, or nudist films without sex scenes, including Hideout in the Sun (1960), Nude on the Moon (1961) and Diary of a Nudist (1961). She also produced a series of sexploitation films.\n\nIn the 1960s, social and judicial attitudes towards the explicit depiction of sexuality began to change. For example, Swedish film I Am Curious (Yellow) (1967) included numerous frank nude scenes and simulated sexual intercourse. In one particularly controversial scene, Lena kisses her lover's flaccid penis. The film was exhibited in mainstream cinemas, but in 1969 it was banned in Massachusetts allegedly for being pornographic. The ban was challenged in the courts, with the Supreme Court of the United States ultimately declaring that the film was not obscene, paving the way for other sexually explicit films. Another Swedish film Language of Love (1969) was also sexually explicit, but was framed as a quasi-documentary sex educational film, which made its legal status uncertain though controversial.\n\nIn 1969, Denmark became the first country to abolish all censorship laws, enabling pornography, including hardcore pornography. The example was followed by toleration in the Netherlands, also in 1969. There was an explosion of pornography commercially produced in those countries, including, at the very beginning, child pornography and bestiality porn. Now that being a pornographer was legal, there was no shortage of businessmen who invested in plant and equipment capable of turning out a mass-produced, cheap, but quality product. Vast amounts of this new pornography, both magazines and films, needed to be smuggled into other parts of Europe, where it was sold \"under the counter\" or (sometimes) shown in \"members only\" cinema clubs.\n\nIn the United States, producers of pornographic films formed the Adult Film Association of America in 1969, after the release of Blue Movie by Andy Warhol, to fight against censorship, and to defend the industry against obscenity charges.\n\n1970s: adult theaters and movie booths in the United States \nIn the 1970s, there was a more tolerant judicial attitude to non-mainstream films. Mainstream theatres did normally not screen even softcore films, leading to a rise of adult theaters in the United States and many other countries. There was also a proliferation of coin-operated \"movie booths\" in sex shops that displayed pornographic \"loops\" (so called because they projected a movie from film arranged in a continuous loop).\n\nDenmark started producing comparatively big-budget theatrical feature film sex comedies such as Bordellet (1972), the Bedside-films (1970\u20131976) and the Zodiac-films (1973\u20131978), starring mainstream actors (a few of whom even performed their own sex scenes) and usually not thought of as \"porno films\" though all except the early Bedside-films included hardcore pornographic scenes. Several of these films still rank among the most seen films in Danish film history and all remain favourites on home video.\n\nIn 1969, Blue Movie by Andy Warhol was the first adult erotic film depicting explicit sex to receive wide theatrical release in the United States. The film was a seminal film in the Golden Age of Porn and, according to Warhol, a major influence in the making of Last Tango in Paris, an internationally controversial erotic drama film, starring Marlon Brando, and released a few years after Blue Movie was made.\n\nThe first explicitly pornographic film with a plot that received a general theatrical release in the U.S. is generally considered to be Mona the Virgin Nymph (also known as Mona), a 59-minute 1970 feature by Bill Osco, who created the relatively high-budget hardcore/softcore (depending on the release) 1974 cult film Flesh Gordon and later, in 1976, the X-rated musical-comedy film Alice in Wonderland.\n\nThe 1971 film Boys in the Sand represented a number of pornographic firsts. As the first generally available gay pornographic film, the film was the first to include on-screen credits for its cast and crew (albeit largely under pseudonyms), to parody the title of a mainstream film (in this case, The Boys in the Band), and, after the 1969 film Blue Movie, one of the first to be reviewed by The New York Times. Other notable American hardcore feature films of the 1970s include Deep Throat (1972), Behind the Green Door (1972), The Devil in Miss Jones (1973), Radley Metzger's The Opening of Misty Beethoven (1976) and Debbie Does Dallas (1978). These were shot on film and screened in mainstream movie theaters. The prediction that frank depictions of onscreen sex would soon become commonplace did not materialize. William Rotsler expressed this in 1973, \"Erotic films are here to stay. Eventually they will simply merge into the mainstream of motion pictures and disappear as a labeled subdivision. Nothing can stop this.\" In Britain, Deep Throat was not approved in its uncut form until 2000 and not shown publicly until June 2005.\n\nThe U.S. was Miller v. California was an important court case in 1973. The case established that obscenity was not legally protected, but the case also established the Miller test, a three-pronged test to determine obscenity (which is not legal) as opposed to indecency (which may or may not be legal).\n\n1980s: new technology and new legal cases\nWith the arrival of the home video cassette recorder in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the pornographic movie industry experienced massive growth and spawned adult stars like Traci Lords, Seka, Christy Canyon, Ginger Lynn, Nina Hartley, and directors such as Gregory Dark. By 1982, most pornographic films were being shot on the cheaper and more convenient medium of videotape. Many film directors resisted this shift at first because videotape produced a different image quality. Those who did change soon were collecting most of the industry's profits, since consumers overwhelmingly preferred the new format. The technology change happened quickly and completely when directors realized that continuing to shoot on film was no longer a profitable option. This change moved the films out of the theaters and into people's homes. This marked the end of the age of big-budget productions, and the beginning of the mainstreaming of pornography. It soon went back to its earthy roots and expanded to cover nearly every fetish possible, since the production of pornography was now inexpensive. Instead of hundreds of pornographic films being made each year, thousands were being made, including compilations of just the sex scenes from various videos. One could now not only watch pornography in the comfort and privacy of one's own home, but also find more choices available to satisfy specific fantasies and fetishes.\n\nSimilarly, the camcorder spurred changes in pornography in the 1980s, when people could make their own amateur sex movies, whether for private use, or for wider distribution.\n\nThe de facto result of the 1987 legal case California v. Freeman effectively legalized hardcore pornography in the U.S.. The prosecution of Harold Freeman was initially planned as the first in a series of legal cases to effectively outlaw the production of such movies.\n\n1990s: DVD and the Internet age\nIn the late 1990s, pornographic films were distributed on DVD. These offered better quality picture and sound than the previous video format (videotape) and allowed innovations such as \"interactive\" videos that let users choose such variables as multiple camera angles, multiple endings and computer-only DVD content.\n\nThe introduction and widespread availability of the Internet further changed the way pornography was distributed. Previously, videos were ordered from an adult bookstore or through mail-order; with the Internet, people could watch pornographic movies on their computers, and instead of waiting weeks for an order to arrive, a movie could be downloaded within minutes (or, later, within a few seconds).\n\nPornography can be distributed over the Internet in a number of ways, including paysites, video hosting services and peer-to-peer file sharing. While pornography had been traded electronically since the 1980s, the invention of the World Wide Web in 1991, as well as the opening of the Internet to the general public around the same time, led to an explosion in online pornography.\n\nViv Thomas, Paul Thomas, Andrew Blake, Antonio Adamo, and Rocco Siffredi were prominent directors of pornographic films in the 1990s. In 1998, the Danish, Oscar-nominated film production company Zentropa became the world's first mainstream film company to openly produce hardcore pornographic films, starting with Constance (1998). That same year, Zentropa also produced Idioterne (1998), directed by Lars von Trier, which won many international awards and was nominated for a Golden Palm in Cannes. The film includes a shower sequence with a male erection and an orgy scene with close-up penetration footage (the camera viewpoint is from the ankles of the participants, and the close-ups leave no doubt as to what is taking place). Idioterne started a wave of international mainstream arthouse films featuring explicit sexual images, such as Catherine Breillat's Romance, which starred pornstar Rocco Siffredi.\n\nIn 1999, the Danish TV channel Kanal K\u00f8benhavn started broadcasting hardcore films at night, uncoded and freely available to any viewer in the Copenhagen area (as of 2009, this is still the case, courtesy of Innocent Pictures, a company started by Zentropa).\n\nOnce people could watch adult movies in the privacy of their own homes, a new adult market developed that far exceeded the scope of its theater-centric predecessor. The Internet served as catalyst for creating a still-larger market for porn, a market that is even less traditionally theatrical.\n\nBy the 2000s, there were hundreds of adult film companies, releasing tens of thousands of productions, recorded directly on video, with minimal sets. The market was further expanded by webcams and webcam recordings, in which thousands of pornographic actors work in front of the camera to satisfy pornography consumers' demand.\n\n2000s: competition and contraction\nBy the 2000s, the fortunes of the pornography industry changed. With reliably profitable DVD sales being largely supplanted by streaming media delivery over the Internet, competition from bootleg, amateur and low-cost professional content on the Internet had made the industry substantially less profitable, leading to it shrinking in size. At the same time this gave rise to video sharing platforms such as Pornhub, YouPorn and XHamster.\n\nPornographic film industry\n\nEconomics\nGlobally, pornography is a large scale business with revenues of nearly $100 billion which includes the production of various media and associated products and services. The industry employs thousands of performers along with support and production staff. It is also followed by dedicated industry publications and trade groups as well as the mainstream press, private organizations (watchdog groups), government agencies, and political organizations. According to a 2005 Reuters article, \"The multi-billion-dollar industry releases about 11,000 titles on DVD each year.\" Pornographic films can be sold or rented out on DVD, shown through Internet and special channels and pay-per-view on cable and satellite, and in adult theaters. However, by 2012, widespread availability of illegally copied content and other low-cost competition on the Internet had made the pornographic film industry smaller and reduced profitability.\n\nThe global pornographic film industry is dominated by the United States, with the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles being the heart of the industry.\n\nIn 1975, the total retail value of all the hardcore pornography in the United States was estimated at $5\u201310\u00a0million. The 1979, Revision of the Federal Criminal Code stated that \"in Los Angeles alone, the porno business does $100\u00a0million a year in gross retain volume.\" According to the 1986 Attorney General's Commission on Pornography, American adult entertainment industry has grown considerably over the past thirty years by continually changing and expanding to appeal to new markets, though the production is considered to be low-profile and clandestine.\n\n the total current income of the country's adult entertainment is often estimated at $10\u201313\u00a0billion, of which $4\u20136\u00a0billion are legal. The figure is often credited to a study by Forrester Research and was lowered in 1998. In 2007 The Observer newspaper also gave a figure of $13\u00a0billion. Other sources, quoted by Forbes (Adams Media Research, Veronis Suhler Communications Industry Report, and IVD), even taking into consideration all possible means (video networks and pay-per-view movies on cable and satellite, websites, in-room hotel movies, phone sex, sex toys, and magazines) mention the $2.6\u20133.9\u00a0billion figure (without the cellphone component). USA Today claimed in 2003 that websites such as Danni's Hard Drive and Cybererotica.com generated $2\u00a0billion in revenue in that year, which was allegedly about 10% of the overall domestic porn market at the time. The adult movies income (from sale and rent) was once estimated by AVN Publications at $4.3\u00a0billion but the figure obtaining is unclear. According to the 2001 Forbes data, the annual income distribution is the following:\n\nThe Online Journalism Review, published by the Annenberg School of Communication at the University of Southern California, weighed in with an analysis that favored Forbes number. The financial extent of adult films, distributed in hotels, is hard to estimate\u2014hotels keep statistics to themselves or do not keep them at all.\n\nThe world's largest adult movie studio Vivid Entertainment generates an estimated $100\u00a0million a year in revenue, distributing 60 films annually, and selling them in video stores, hotel rooms, on cable systems, and on the Internet. The Spanish-based studio Private Media Group was listed on the NASDAQ until November 2011. Video rentals soared from just under 80\u00a0million in 1985 to a half-billion by 1993. Some subsidiaries of major corporations are the largest pornography sellers, like News Corporation's DirecTV. Comcast, the nation's largest cable company, once pulled in $50\u00a0million from adult programming. Revenues of companies such as Playboy and Hustler were small by comparison.\n\nProduction\n\nPornographic films are produced and directed at the target audience, who buy and view the films. Traditionally, the audience of pornographic films has been predominantly the straight male. In this situation, the main male actor acted as proxy for the viewer enacting the sexual fantasy of the genre of the film. A typical pornographic film featured a female performer on whom the film focused. Her male partner traditionally had no distinctive features other than a large penis. However, there has been an increase in female viewers over time, and there have recently been efforts to increase the sexualization of male performers also. New features such as men with smaller penises, charming facial features and well-built bodies are becoming predominant in pornographic films, as well as the emergence of feminist pornography.\"'Artisanal, locally grown, free range porn for women\" Nagy, Toni. Huffington Post, 4 March 2013. Accessed 11 October 2013 In recent times a gay audience has also developed, and the scenarios of the films have adjusted accordingly.\n\nPornographic films attempt to present a sexual fantasy and the actors selected for a particular role are primarily selected on their ability to create that fantasy. Depending on the genre of the film, the on-screen appearance and physical features of the main actors and their ability to create the sexual mood of the film is of critical importance. Most actors specialize in certain genres. In general, pornographic films follow a number of conventions. For example, irrespective of the genre, most actors are required to appear nude in pornographic films.\n\nIn films directed to a heterosexual male audience, the primary focus is on the female actors in them, who are mostly selected for their on-screen appearance. The female actors are commonly presented in erotic, provocative or suggestive clothing. If they are wearing shoes, they are usually high-heel. They do not normally wear jewellery or glasses. They are usually in the high range of physical attractiveness.\n\nMost male performers in heterosexual pornography are selected less for their looks than for their sexual prowess. They are presented as being able to fulfill the desires of the male watching audience as their on-screen proxies.\n\nLegal status\n\nIn the United States, the Supreme Court held in 1969 that State laws making mere private possession of obscene material a crime are invalid. Further attempts were made in the 1970s in the United States to close down the pornography industry, this time by prosecuting those in the industry on prostitution charges. The prosecution started in the courts in California in the case of People v. Freeman. The California Supreme Court acquitted Freeman and distinguished between someone who takes part in a sexual relationship for money (prostitution) versus someone whose role is merely portraying a sexual relationship on-screen as part of their acting performance. The State did not appeal to the United States Supreme Court making the decision binding in California, where most pornographic films are made today.But see news.com.au: Coffee shop girls face charges over sex shows February 08, 2010\n\nAt present, no other state in the United States has either implemented or accepted this legal distinction between commercial pornography performers versus prostitutes as shown in the Florida case where sex film maker Clinton Raymond McCowen, aka \"Ray Guhn\", was indicted on charges of \"soliciting and engaging in prostitution\" for his creation of pornography films which included \"McCowen and his associates recruited up to 100 local men and women to participate in group sex scenes, the affidavit says.\" The distinction that California has in its legal determination in the Freeman decision is usually denied in most states' local prostitution laws, which do not specifically exclude performers from such inclusion.\n\nIn some cases, some states have ratified their local state laws for inclusion to prevent California's Freeman decision to be applied to actors who are paid a fee for sexual actions within their state borders. One example is the state of Texas whose prostitution law specifically states:\n\nAn offense is established under Subsection (a)(1) whether the actor is to receive or pay a fee. An offense is established under Subsection (a)(2) whether the actor solicits a person to hire him or offers to hire the person solicited.\n\nIn the United States, federal law prohibits the sale, distribution or dissemination of obscene materials through the mail, over the broadcast airwaves, on cable or satellite TV, on the Internet, over the telephone or by any other means that cross state lines. Most states also have specific laws banning the sale or distribution of obscene pornography within state borders. The only protection for obscene material recognized by the Supreme Court of the United States is personal possession in the home (Stanley v. Georgia).\n\nThe Supreme Court of the United States affirmed in Miller v. California that obscenity was not protected speech. Further, the court ruled that each community is responsible for setting its own standards about what is considered to be obscene material. If pornographic material is prosecuted and brought to trial, a jury can deem it obscene based on:\n whether \"the average person, applying contemporary community standards\" would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest\n whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by applicable state law and\n whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.\n\nIn many countries pornography is legal to distribute and to produce, but there are some restrictions. Pornography is also banned in some countries, in particular in the Muslim world and China, but can be accessed through the Internet in some of these nations.\n\n Health issues \nSex acts in pornographic films have traditionally been performed without the use of condoms, with an accompanying risk of sexually transmitted disease among performers. In 1986, there was an outbreak of HIV infection which led to the deaths through AIDS of several actors and actresses. This led to the creation in 1998 of the Adult Industry Medical Health Care Foundation, which helped set up a monitoring system in the U.S. pornographic film industry, which required pornographic film actors to be tested for HIV every 30 days. , HIV infection of performers in the U.S. pornography industry has been rare, with only a few outbreaks being recorded over the subsequent three decades. The AIM closed its doors in May 2011 and filed for bankruptcy as a result of a court case arising from an inadvertent leak by it of confidential information on clients, including names and STD results.\n\nTerminology\n\n Compilation \u2013 a release based on highlights from other adult films or video, unused footage, or that feature a particular genre\n Mature \u2013 used to refer to performers in or of the genre referred to as MILF porn\n Raincoat \u2013 a term used to refer to a condom\n Other terms synonymous with pornography:\nPorn or porno\nAdult film\nBlue movie\nStag film\nSkin flick\n\nSee also\n\n List of pornographic film awards\n Adult theater\n Amateur pornography\n Cartoon pornography\n Cum shot\n List of pornographic film studios\n Pornography addiction \n Porn groove\n Porn parody\n Pornography by region\n STDs in the porn industry\n Unsimulated sex\n X-rated\n\nReferencesNotesBibliography'''\n Patrick Robertson: Film Facts'', 2001, Billboard Books,\n\nExternal links\n \n\n Films\n \nFilm genres", "machine_text": "Pornographic film A pornographic film or adult film is a type of film that features explicit sexual content and focuses on sexual activity of individuals. Pornographic films are usually designed for adults and meant for private consumption, but they have been widely distributed to the public through the internet and other means of dissemination. History The production of pornographic films can trace back to the 19th century. The first pornographic films were silent black-and-white shorts that were shown in adult theaters or \"smut houses\" in major cities. Later, in the 1960s and 70s, the widespread availability of 8 mm film and Super 8 cameras allowed the production of homemade pornographic films. The pornographic film industry started to emerge during the 1970s, known as the \"Golden Age of Porn\". This era saw the emergence of a new group of pornographic actors and directors who created innovative and artistic pornographic films. Current state The availability of the internet has revolutionized the way pornographic films are produced and consumed. It has made it easier and cheaper for amateur producers to enter the industry and distribute their films online. In some countries, the production and distribution of pornographic films are illegal, while in others, they are legal but regulated. The pornographic industry generates billions of dollars in revenue worldwide, with the United States and Japan being the biggest markets. Criticism and controversy The production and consumption of pornographic films have been subject to criticism and controversy. Critics argue that the industry is exploitative and objectifies women, contributing to the sexualization and objectification of women in society. Some studies have found a link between exposure to pornography and negative outcomes such as sexual dysfunction, addiction, and harm to relationships. However, other studies have disputed these findings, arguing that pornography is not harmful in moderation. Conclusion Pornographic films remain a controversial and popular form of adult entertainment. The industry faces challenges from changing consumer behaviors, technological disruption, and regulation. Despite criticism, it is likely that pornographic films will continue to be produced and consumed as long as there is a market for them.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 238253}

Her work was widely anthologized and translated into various languages, including Italian, Japanese and Finnish.\n\nBiography \nShe was born in the Peak District, Derbyshire, in 1936, and attended the University of Bristol where she received her BA in French. She then moved to Australia for ten years, where she was a Tutor in French at the University of Queensland while studying for her M.A. and Ph.D., both on French Surrealism. In 1971 she returned to the UK, and settled in Helston, Cornwall, in 1974, where she undertook tutoring in Twentieth-Century Poetry for the Open University and for the University of Exeter Extra-Mural programme, while writing and publishing her major works of poetry. She was appointed as Cornwall's first Writer in the Community in 1986, and was regularly invited to give Poetry Workshops and courses at the Arvon Foundation. She received an honorary Doctor of Letters from the University of Exeter in recognition of her literary achievements in 1989, and many of her literary papers are held in the University of Exeter archive. She lived on her own in Helston from 1990 until her death.\n\nWork \nHer first work, Time & Motion (1975) was published in Australia under the name \"Sylvia Kantarizis\", and her poetry is sometimes republished under that name in anthologies of Australian poetry. However, most of her work was published in Britain, and some of her poetry has a specifically Cornish theme. Her second major book, The Tenth Muse (1983) explores the relationship of women to writing, and \"through its title, evokes a whole tradition of women's poetry\". Shortly after its publication, she was involved in a lively feminist debate in the Letters pages of The Times Literary Supplement concerning a fictional \"Hysterical Women's Movement\" that many contemporary reviewers of women's writing appeared to believe in. Her next collection, The Sea at the Door (1985) is described by one reviewer as \"a haunted book \u2013 haunted by past and present selves, none of them quite real\", noting particularly the way in which she often engages intense erotic themes through the filter of imagination and dreams. Some of her work focuses on fraught relationships between men and women, together with an exploration of gender politics, notably News from the Front (1983), co-authored with the poet and novelist D. M. Thomas, in which each poet explores the conflictive relationship between a young Portuguese radical and a right-wing British businessman, with each sometimes adopting the feminine and sometimes the masculine persona. The Air Mines of Mistila (1988), written in collaboration with the poet Philip Gross, has a Latin American theme, with allusions to the novel Pedro P\u00e1ramo by Juan Rulfo in a number of the poems. This collection won the Poetry Book Society Choice of 1988. Her next published book, Dirty Washing (1989) contains selected poems drawn from four previous books together with several new poems. Her penultimate book, Lad's Love (1993), is a collection of love poetry, exploring the relationship between an older woman and a younger man. Her last book, entitled Lost Property (1998), is a miscellaneous collection of her later poetry.\n\nShe was also the author of a number of academic articles on Dada and French Surrealism (published under the name Sylvia Kantarizis), and essays on poetry.\n\nPoetry collections \n Time & Motion (Australia: Prism/Poetry Society of Australia, 1975 ; rpt Cornwall: Menhir, 1986 )\n Stocking Up (Menhir, 1981 )\n The Tenth Muse (Liskeard: Harry Chambers/Peterloo Poets, 1983 ; rpt Menhir, 1986 )\n The Sea at the Door (London: Secker & Warburg Limited, 1985), translated as Il mare alla porta: poesie by Simonetta Zappal\u00e0 (Forl\u00ec, Italy: Forum / Quinta Generazione, 1991 )\n News from the Front by D.M.

Kantaris later moved to the United States, where she continued her education at the Art Institute of Chicago and the New York Studio School. Kantaris' work is influenced by her Greek heritage and her interest in mythology and nature. Her paintings often depict abstracted landscapes and figures, imbued with a sense of movement and emotion. Her use of vibrant colors and expressive brushstrokes creates a dynamic, gestural quality to her work. One of Kantaris' most notable works is a large-scale triptych titled \"Ode to Democracy.\" Created in response to the Greek debt crisis, the painting features a central figure representing the Greek people, surrounded by symbols of democracy and Greek mythology. The painting was featured in a solo exhibition at the Hellenic American Union in Athens in 2015. Kantaris has exhibited her work in galleries and museums internationally, including the National Gallery of Greece, the Chicago Cultural Center, and the Hellenic American Union. Her work is also held in private collections in the United States, Greece, and Europe. In addition to her painting career, Kantaris is also a passionate advocate for the arts. She has served on the board of directors for various arts organizations, including the Hellenic American Cultural and Educational Foundation and the International Art Alliance. Kantaris now divides her time between New York City and Athens, where she continues to create and exhibit her work.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Schnellbomber\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "A Schnellbomber (German; literally \"fast bomber\") is a bomber that relies upon speed to avoid enemy fighters, rather than relying on defensive armament and armor.\n\nConcept\nThe concept developed in the 1930s when it was believed that a very fast bomber could simply outrun its enemies. Omitting defensive armament allowed for significant reduction in drag (there would be no turrets, gondolas or gun barrels protruding from the fuselage) as well as weight (no guns, ammunition or manning crew members would be required on board), resulting in improved performance.\n\nAdolf Hitler was a staunch supporter of the Schnellbomber and directed the Luftwaffe to only develop medium bombers, while the USA and British developed both twin-engine medium bombers and four-engine heavy bombers. Twin-engine medium bombers, while best adapted as the Schnellbomber, lacked the payload and range of heavy bombers which put them at considerable disadvantage for strategic bombing. In strategic bombing raids the Luftwaffe made do with medium bombers with limited fighter escort from the Messerschmitt Bf 109 and its heavier twin-engine Bf 110 counterpart due to the lack of a truly long-range fighter. The Allies by contrast used slow but heavily armed bombers such as the B-17 Flying Fortress deployed in combat box formation, with the long-range North American P-51 Mustang initially in escort and later in forward role conducting a \"fighter sweep\" in order to intercept attacking German fighters.\n\nDevelopment\nThe first aircraft adopted for the Schnellbomber role was the single-engine Heinkel He 70, but it soon was replaced by the twin-engine Dornier Do 17 in that role. In the 1937 air races in Switzerland the Do 17 won a number of speed records, apparently demonstrating the value of the concept. However, experience of the Spanish Civil War demonstrated that the Do 17's speed when loaded with military equipment was insufficient to escape interception, and armament had to be added to give it some defensive fighting capability.\n\nBomber development temporarily outpaced fighter development in the 1930s. The last generation of biplane fighters (like the Gloster Gladiator and Polikarpov I-15) that had been placed in service during that decade could not catch the privately created Bristol Type 142 twin-engined light bomber prototype in 1935. However by the end of the 1930s, low-wing monoplane fighters like the Hawker Hurricane and the Supermarine Spitfire had entered service, and they had the performance to catch up with the Schnellbomber, and dramatically outgun it by eight to one (only one gun would normally be able to fire back). The Do 17 suffered badly at the hands of the RAF during the Battle of Britain, and its production run ended in 1940.\n\nJapan's air war in China\nAs World War II broke out in Asia with the Battle of Shanghai and Battle of Nanjing, the Imperial Japanese Navy dispatched dozens of their unescorted Mitsubishi G3M bombers in the schnellbomber strategy of Giulio Douhet's total war concept of attacks against Chinese Air Force assets as well as civilian targets, however, the strategy backfired as the Japanese underestimated the effectiveness of the Chinese air raid early-warning net and the numbers of experienced Chinese pilots leading their squadrons of Curtiss Hawk III (max-speed marginally slower than G3M) and Boeing P-26 Model 281 (max-speed marginally faster than G3M) fighters in a bloody rout against the Japanese bombers. Nonetheless, the total war strategy with the schnellbomber wasn't lost to the Japanese, as the Chinese lost many of their top fighter pilots by Fall of Nanking at the end of 1937, and with ever-growing Japanese blockade of war materials and high-octane aviation fuel particularly following the capture of Nanning in the Battle of South Guangxi, the increasing obsolescence of Chinese fighter aircraft burning low-grade fuel versus fast and high-flying massed bomber formations burning high-octane avgas continued to wreak havoc and devastation against Chinese cities for years to come, particularly in the Battle of Chongqing and Chengdu beginning in May 1939; eventually however, the United States enacted an oil and steel embargo against Japan in July 1941.\n\nGermany's quest for \"fast bombers\"\nThe Germans nevertheless persisted in their attempts to create newer Schnellbombers, as opposed to large bombers with heavy defensive armaments which were favored by the RAF and USAAF. Other aircraft recognized as Schnellbombers by the Luftwaffe were the Junkers Ju 88, the first to be custom-designed for the role, three years before the start of the war, the Messerschmitt Me 410 Hornisse in 1943, and the jet-engined Arado Ar 234 Blitz (dubbed \"the fastest bomber\" \u2013 \"Schnellstbomber\").\n\nSeveral other Luftwaffe aircraft were originally designed as fast bombers, but entered service in other roles; these include the Heinkel He 219 as a night fighter, and the Dornier Do 335 \u2014 meant to have a small, ventral weapons bay to accommodate droppable ordnance from the start \u2014 as a new Zerst\u00f6rer heavy fighter, faster than any other piston-twin of World War II with a top speed of some 765\u00a0km/h (475\u00a0mph).  The Bomber B high-speed medium bomber design competition for the Luftwaffe started in July 1939 was meant to create an updated design to take over the original Schnellbomber role by later in World War II, and function with a heavier bombload than the earlier Schnellbomber designs were capable of carrying, but due to the intractable development problems plaguing them, the continued unavailability of the needed pair of high power output engines of 1,500\u00a0kW (2,000\u00a0hp) and above each - primarily the complex, 24-cylinder multibank Junkers Jumo 222 - needed for such designs, no production aircraft were ever ordered under the Bomber B program.\n\nde Havilland Mosquito\nThe most successful Schnellbomber of the war was the bomber version of the British de Havilland Mosquito. It retained a speed advantage over its enemies for much of the war, and was only able to be effectively countered by specialist versions of various night fighter designs, with the pioneering Me 262A jet fighter being a true potential threat in 1944. The Mosquito ended the war with the lowest loss rate among any aircraft in RAF Bomber Command. The Germans considered the Mosquito a superior implementation of their own Schnellbomber concept, and being a potential inspiration for the Focke-Wulf firm's own all-wood twin-engined, high-speed fighter design, the Focke-Wulf Ta 154 being given the name Moskito.\n\nSee also\nBomber B - 1939 design competition, meant to replace all bombers in Luftwaffe service\nFighter-bomber\nLight bomber\n\nReferences\n\nBomber aircraft\nLuftwaffe", "machine_text": "Schnellbomber was a German term used during World War II to refer to a high-speed bomber used by the German Luftwaffe. The word translates to \"fast bomber\" in English. The aircraft was specifically designed for high speed and was used for tactical bombing, reconnaissance, and close air support. The first aircraft to be designated as a Schnellbomber was the Junkers Ju 88, which entered service in 1939. It was a versatile aircraft that could be used for many different roles, including night fighting and maritime attacks. The Ju 88 was powered by twin engines and had a top speed of around 560 km/h. It could carry a heavy bomb load of up to 3,500 kg. The Focke-Wulf Fw 190 was another aircraft that was sometimes referred to as a Schnellbomber. It was a single-engine fighter-bomber that was fast, heavily armed, and highly maneuverable. The Fw 190 could carry up to 500 kg of bombs and had a top speed of around 700 km/h. Other notable Schnellbombers included the Messerschmitt Bf 110 and the Heinkel He 219. These aircraft were primarily used for nighttime bombing, barge-busting, and ground-attack duties. The Bf 110 had a top speed of around 560 km/h and could carry a bomb load of up to 2,500 kg. The He 219 was a twin-engine fighter-bomber that had a top speed of around 620 km/h and was heavily armed with cannons and machine guns. By the end of the war, the Schnellbomber concept had been largely superseded by jet-powered aircraft, such as the Messerschmitt Me 262. However, these high-speed bombers played an important role in the German war effort and helped to establish the Luftwaffe's reputation as a force to be reckoned with.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1791957}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Integral linearity\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "A measurement system consists of a sensor, to input the physical parameter that is of interest, and an output to a medium that is suitable for reading by the system that needs to know the value of the parameter. (This could be a device to convert the temperature of the surrounding air or water into the visually readable height of a column of mercury in a small tube, for example; but the conversion could also be made to an electronic encoding of the parameter, for reading by a computer system.)\n\nThe integral linearity is then a measure of the fidelity of the conversion that is performed by the measuring system. It is the relation of the output to the input over a range expressed as a percentage of the full-scale measurements.  Integral linearity is a measure of the device's deviation from ideal linear behaviour.\n\nThe most common denotation of integral linearity is independent linearity.\n\nIn the context of a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) or an analog-to-digital converter (ADC), independent linearity is fitted to minimize the deviation with respect to the ideal behaviour with no constraints. Other types of integral linearity place constraints on the symmetry or end points of the linear fit with respect to the actual data.\n\nIn the case of position sensors, two general types exist. Differences between the two regarding independent linearity essentially relate to the type of mechanical interface - linear or rotary. For rotary position sensors, as a shaft (or in the case of magnetic sensors, a magnet) is turned over a defined mechanical range in a direction causing an increasing response, an output voltage changes from a minimum to maximum value. The variation from an ideal linear relationship as this device is changed from minimum to maximum range end-points is the independent linearity error. It is measured in a practical sense as deviation of output voltage as a percentage of input voltage with the maximum value as the range is traversed, usually being referred to in a device's specifications. The same description holds for linear position sensors except that a straight rod (or magnet) is moved along the length of the sensor or as it extends from the end of a linear position sensor.\n\nNotes\n\n \nMeasurement", "machine_text": "Integral Linearity Integral linearity is a term used in electronics and signal processing to describe the linearity of an analog-to-digital converter (ADC). It refers to the relationship between the input voltage to the ADC and the digital output code produced by the converter. Specifically, integral linearity describes the error or deviation in the output code compared to the expected ideal output code for a given input voltage. In an ideal ADC, the output code would be perfectly linear with respect to the input voltage. However, due to imperfections in the converter's design, such as non-ideal components or manufacturing variations, there can be deviations from this ideal behavior. Integral linearity is one important specification used to quantify the performance of an ADC. Integral linearity is typically measured as the maximum deviation from the ideal output code, expressed as a percentage of the full-scale input voltage range. For example, a 12-bit ADC with a range of 0 to 5 volts might have an integral linearity specification of +/-0.5 LSB (least significant bit), which corresponds to a maximum deviation of 0.024% of the full-scale range. Improving integral linearity generally requires improving the accuracy of the analog portions of the ADC, such as the reference voltage and the input buffer.

The band was created in 1988 with heavy influences from Metallica and other important metal acts of the 80s, as well as some popular Latino music.\n\nCareer \nEven since their beginning as a metal band, Ekhymosis (Greek:  ecchymosis \"bruise\") showed the same pro-Latino lyrics as Kraken. After some live performances to become known in their city (and more regions of Colombia), the band recorded a demo of two songs, which described the violence in Medell\u00edn and the injustice of innocent deaths and other problems in Colombia. The demo sold out (thanks to friends and family of the band), and they decided to record a second. This time Ekhymosis had luck: In the studio was a Codiscos representative; she heard and liked the demo and the band signed with that label.\n\n1993 saw the release of Ni\u00f1o Gigante, a heavy metal album that included one of the band's most well known songs, \"Solo\". Controversy and the term \"sell-out\" surrounded the band with their next release: 1994's Ciudad Pac\u00edfico, produced by Federico L\u00f3pez, a more hard rock-oriented record with more Latin sounds. Ekhymosis was looking for their unique sound; they didn't want to be the \"Spanish Metallica\". Rather, they wanted to create Colombian rock.\n\nIn the following year, 1995, the band with its two new members, released Amor Biling\u00fce, topping the Colombian charts with the single \"De Madrugada\". The video of the song had incredible replay value on MTV Latino. The same year, Ekhymosis recorded a rock version of the National Anthem of Colombia, which caused controversy among some, but was well received among Colombian youth. Ekhymosis was the chosen band to open for Bon Jovi in November of that year, but due to the murder of the politician Alvaro G\u00f3mez the band decided not to play in order to allow the concert to finish earlier.\n\nThe next year, the band released their unplugged album, titled Ac\u00fastico, and Ekhymosis decided to go to Los Angeles where they played in local pubs and began recording their new album. In 1996, the band, now with four members (Juan Esteban, Andr\u00e9s, Toby and Jos\u00e9) recorded in L.A. their self-titled album, which saw the re-makes of three of their best songs (\"Solo\", \"Sin Rencores\", \"De Madrugada\") and new ones, the most remarkable being \"La Tierra\", known by some fans as \"the second Colombian Anthem\". The band was at its peak, but little knew the fans that those were the last days of one of the most important bands in Colombia.\n\nIn 1997, Ekhymosis won 3 Shock Awards (Best National Group, Best Song for \"La Tierra\", and Best Composer for Juan Esteban). Some months later, due to internal problems in deciding the future of the band, Ekhymosis disbanded. Juan Esteban, then, began his solo career as Juanes; the drummer of the band, Jose Lopera, worked with him on his first album, and has continued to work with Juanes to this day; the guitarist of Ekhymosis, Toby, started to play with Juanes on his second album and has continued with Juanes as well. Juanes has been known to perform Ekhymosis songs at his concerts, namely \"Solo\" and \"La Tierra\".\n\nReunion \n\nIn 2012, the band announced a reunion with new members, in a rendition to their origins as a thrash metal band, and playing their early songs before 1992.

Bruises can occur anywhere on the body and can range in size and severity depending on the cause and force of the impact. The most common causes of bruises are trauma or injury, such as bumps, falls, or sports injuries. Medical conditions such as bleeding disorders, autoimmune diseases, and certain medications can also increase the risk of bruising. Symptoms of a bruise typically include pain, swelling, and discoloration of the skin, which may range from a mild yellow or green color to a deep purple or black shade. In some cases, bruises may become infected and require medical treatment. Treatment for a bruise typically involves rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE) to relieve pain and reduce swelling. Over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen may also be used. For severe bruises, medical attention may be necessary to drain pooled blood or reduce pressure on the affected area. To prevent bruises, individuals should take precautions such as wearing protective equipment during physical activities, avoiding falls and injuries, and seeking prompt medical attention for any underlying medical conditions that increase the risk of bruising. In conclusion, Ekhymosis is a common injury that can occur due to a variety of causes. While most bruises will heal on their own with proper care, severe or recurring bruises should be evaluated by a medical professional.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 4727551}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Plugola\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Plugola is the illicit business practice of endorsing a product or service on radio or television for personal gain, without the consent of the network or stations. \"Pluggers\" have been known to accept bribes of money, alcohol, or free products and services. This contrasts greatly from commercial sponsorship because the benefits of the endorsement go to the individual talent or programmers, while the stations and networks receive no revenue.\n\nHistory \nIn the 1950s, concern over illicit business practices in television and radio including; plugola, payola, and rigged game shows led to congressional and U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) hearings. In 1959, Attorney General William Rogers reported to President Dwight Eisenhower that deceptive and false advertising and programming was becoming a trend in the United States, and needed to stop. In that same year, FCC Chairman John Doerfer presented his plan to expand public service programming on television networks. The plan called for some public service programming in prime time slots, which did not occur before this. The networks likely had the same agenda as Doerfer, to regain the respect of the viewers, and agreed to Doerfer's plan. By 1960, amendments were made to the Communications Act of 1934 to punish those who engaged in these illicit acts in the future.\n\nSee also\n Radio promotion\n Payola\n\nReferences \n\nBroadcasting\nAdvertising", "machine_text": "Plugola is a term used to describe the practice of secretly promoting a product or service on broadcast media through payola or other incentives. This practice is deemed unethical by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), as it undermines the credibility of the media and violates the public trust. The term \"plugola\" was coined in the 1950s during the era of radio and television shows. It referred to the practice of radio DJs and TV hosts accepting gifts, cash, or other incentives from record labels, musicians, and other sponsors in exchange for playing their songs or featuring their products on-air. This allowed sponsors to gain an unfair advantage over their competitors and manipulate the preferences of the audience. The problem of plugola became so widespread that the FCC had to intervene and issue regulations to prevent it. In 1959, the FCC adopted the \"Payola Report,\" which required broadcasters to disclose any material connections between sponsors and hosts and to keep records of all transactions. Violators could face hefty fines, license revocation, or even criminal charges. Despite these regulations, plugola continued to occur in various forms. In the 2000s, the rise of internet blogging and social media influencers led to new forms of stealth marketing, in which brands paid bloggers or vloggers to promote their products without disclosing their financial incentives. This has led to renewed debates about the ethics of sponsored content and the need for transparency in advertising. In conclusion, plugola is a controversial and unethical practice that undermines the integrity of broadcast media. It remains a challenge for regulators and media companies to prevent and detect, and it requires continued vigilance to protect the public interest.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 31578645}

While ska and reggae stylings have always provided the common musical thread, over the past 15 plus years Ruder Than You has been mixing in dancehall, hip hop, rocksteady, and rub-a-dub \u2013 even adding elements of funk, jazz, and punk \u2013 to create their own unique sound.\n\nIn 1992, Moon Records, officially MoonSKA NYC, put out their debut album, Big Step, and its follow-up Horny for Ska in 1996. By the mid 1990s the group had morphed from a five-piece into a nine-piece outfit and captured a loyal following in the Philadelphia and New York City areas. The group toured nationally, regularly opening up for groups like the Skatalites, Steel Pulse, Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Desmond Dekker, Ziggy Marley, Special Beat, Bad Manners, Fishbone, Yellowman, Eek a Mouse, and No Doubt. Ruder Than You CDs were internationally released in Japan and England, and songs can be found on dozens of ska compilations around the globe.\n\nWith Moon Records defunct, the band released their long-awaited third album, Philly Stylee, on their own God\u2019s Ghetto Records label. The album features Trish Johnson on bari-sax and several top Philadelphia guest musicians including jazz trumpeter, John Swana. Philly Stylee was recorded in spurts during the Third-wave ska trend between 1996 and 1999 with final vocal overdubs and mixes completed in 2004. Philly Stylee'''s lengthy production was due to many factors affecting the band.  This included the demise of the band\u2019s former label Moon Records, a 3-year incarceration of lead singer and toaster Freddie \"3D\" Weaver, and the death of bari-sax player Trish Johnson, who was killed in the morning while traveling to Shenandoah, PA, to visit her mother. Despite these obstacles, after taking a nearly 3-year hiatus, the band began rehearsals again in 2003 and completed the CD.\n\nThe band\u2019s latest release, and first truly fresh studio endeavor of the decade, is the 5-song EP entitled God\u2019s Ghetto (2008). The EP is released on the East-African record label Lulu Nyeusi and represents the first known American ska-influenced music release on an African record label. Ruder Than You has always had an eclectic sound and this release is no exception. For this installment, the band chose tunes heavy on old school hip-hop and dancehall and emphasized lyrics penned by Weaver. While these songs differ a bit from the familiar feel of previous albums, they offer the same extraordinary energy and catchiness.\n\nThe band\u2019s current roster of veteran members includes the Round Mound of Dub Sound - singer Freddie Weaver. Band leader Doug Dubrosky still sings and plays tenor sax. He and Don Pancoe on bass hail from the earliest days of RTY.

The dark D-type asteroid belongs to the 20 largest Jupiter trojans and has a rotation period of 10.15 hours. It was named after the Greek hero and great archer, Teucer.\n\nOrbit and classification \n\nTeucer is a dark Jovian asteroid orbiting in the leading Greek camp at Jupiter's  Lagrangian point, 60\u00b0 ahead of its orbit in a 1:1 resonance . It is also a non-family asteroid in the Jovian background population.\n\nIt orbits the Sun at a distance of 4.7\u20135.6\u00a0AU once every 11 years and 6 months (4,213 days; semi-major axis of 5.1\u00a0AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.09 and an inclination of 22\u00b0 with respect to the ecliptic.\n\nThe body's observation arc begins with its first observation as  at Turku Observatory in December 1940, more than 40 years prior to its official discovery observation at Anderson Mesa.\n\nNaming \n\nThis minor planet was named after the Greek hero Teucer, from Greek mythology. The son of King Telamon was a great archer and half-brother of Ajax, with whom he fought alongside in the Trojan War. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 17 February 1984 ().\n\nPhysical characteristics \n\nTeucer has been characterized as a dark D-type asteroid by Pan-STARRS' survey as well as in the SDSS-based taxonomy. It is also an assumed C-type asteroid.\n\nRotation period \n\nSeveral rotational lightcurves of Teucer have been obtained from photometric observations since 1992. Analysis of the best-rated lightcurve from September 2010, by Daniel Coley at the Center for Solar System Studies  gave a well-defined rotation period of  hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.20 magnitude ().\n\nDiameter and albedo \n\nAccording to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Teucer measures between 89.43 and 113.99 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.059 and 0.073.\n\nThe Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link derives an albedo of 0.0435 and a diameter of 110.72 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 8.8.

It was named after Teucer, a legendary archer from Greek mythology. This asteroid has an orbital period of 3.6 years and an eccentricity of 0.152, which brings it within 1.93 astronomical units (AU) of the sun at perihelion and takes it out to 2.73 AU at aphelion. It has a diameter of approximately 7.7 kilometers and spins on its axis once every 2.5 hours. Observations of 2797 Teucer have shown that it has a dark surface, with an albedo of only 0.041, indicating that it reflects only 4.1% of the sunlight that hits it. This suggests that it is most likely composed of carbon-rich materials that have been altered by the harsh conditions of space. The spectral classification of 2797 Teucer is uncertain, but it has been proposed to be a C-type or D-type asteroid, which are both carbonaceous asteroids.

His father was of German Jewish descent. He was educated at Harrow School and Christ Church, Oxford, where he read Philosophy, Politics and Economics, earning an Oxford MA.\n\nBusiness career\nOppenheimer joined Anglo American in 1968, was appointed a director in 1974, then became deputy chairman in 1983. He resigned in 2001, remaining a non-executive director until 2011.\n\nHe was appointed deputy chairman of the then Central Selling Organisation (now Diamond Trading Company) in 1984, and deputy chairman of De Beers Consolidated Mines in 1985. He was also appointed chairman of the Diamond Trading Company in 1985.

The United States defeated Finland 2\u20131 in a shootout, to win its fifth consecutive and ninth overall title.\n\nBackground \n\nSince the first IIHF Women's World Championship in 1990 and the first women's tournament at the Winter Olympics in 1998, the American and Canadian national teams have played in the finals on all occasions except for the 2006 Winter Olympics, where Sweden played Canada after eliminating the United States in the semi-final.\n\nFinland stunned Canada in the semi-finals, beating them by a score of 4\u20132, their first-ever semifinal victory and advanced to the gold medal game for the first time in IIHF Women's World Championship history.\n\nDisallowed goal controversy\nDuring the final between the United States and Finland, it appeared Finland had won 2\u20131 after Petra Nieminen\u00a0scored what appeared to be the game-winning goal in overtime. It would've been Finland first World Championship. However, since Finnish defender Jenni Hiirikoski  was pushed towards American goaltender Alex Rigsby just outside of the crease, the Video Goal Judge initiated a video review while the Finnish players were celebrating on the ice. The goal was reviewed for over ten minutes and eventually overturned. The IIHF released a press statement the next day citing rules 186 and 183ii as the reasons for overturning the goal. The two rules read:-According to IIHF Playing Rule 186 v. Goaltender and Goal/Goal Crease Disallowed: An attacking skater who makes contact other than incidental with a goaltender who is out of his goal crease during game action will be assessed a minor penalty for interference. If a goal is scored at this time, it will not count.\n \n-According to IIHF Playing Rule 183 ii. Protection of a Goaltender: Incidental contact is allowed when the goaltender is in the act of playing the puck outside his goal crease, provided the attacking skater makes a reasonable effort to minimize or avoid such contact. \n\nDespite the goal being disallowed, Rigsby was issued a two-minute penalty for tripping and Hiirikoski was not issued any penalties. Neither team was able to score in the remaining minutes of overtime, with the Americans successfully killing off two power-plays. The United States went on to defeat Finland 2\u20131 in the shootout.\n\nFinnish goaltender Noora R\u00e4ty\u00a0finished with 51 saves on 52 shots and Rigbsy with 26 saves on 27 shots.\n\nReactions  \nFollowing an initial period of uncertainty as the goal was being reviewed, the final decision to overturn the goal sparked a number of strong reactions from players, staff, and fans. Finnish NHLer Kasperi Kapanen spoke out against the decision, stating that \"I think they kind of messed it up,\" with retired Canadian Olympian Hayley Wickenheiser agreeing, stating \"That. Was. A. Goal.\"\n\nRigsby defended the decision, stating that she had immediately known the goal was illegal, and that \"I was the one who got body-slammed. But the ref thinks I tried tripping the player when I was on the ground, and somehow I end up with the penalty. Funny how that went.\" She, however, still praised Finland, stating that \"This is the best Finnish team we\u2019ve ever seen.\"\n\nAftermath   \nAfter the game, the Finnish ice hockey association announced that it would be giving the players the \u20ac7000 bonus for winning gold instead of the \u20ac5000 bonus for winning silver. Unlike the men's World Championships, however, there was no IIHF bonus for the players for winning either medal.\n\nFinnish broadcaster Yle released viewership numbers of over 2,3 million people watching the finals on TV in Finland - more than half the country's population.

Leighton lies approximately  west of Huntingdon. Leighton is situated within Huntingdonshire which is a non-metropolitan district of Cambridgeshire as well as being a historic county of England. The civil parish of which it is part is called Leighton and in 2001 had a population of 224, falling to 210 at the 2011 Census. The parish covers an area of .\n\nHistory\nLeighton Bromswold was listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 in the Hundred of Leightonstone in Huntingdonshire; the name of the settlement was written as Lectone. In 1086 there was just one manor at Leighton Bromswold; the annual rent paid to the lord of the manor in 1066 had been \u00a323 and the rent was the same in 1086.\n\nThe Domesday Book does not explicitly detail the population of a place but it records that there were 39 households at Leighton Bromswold. There is no consensus about the average size of a household at that time; estimates range from 3.5 to 5.0 people per household. Using these figures then an estimate of the population of Leighton Bromswold in 1086 is that it was within the range of 136 and 195 people.\n\nThe survey records that there were 19.5 ploughlands at Leighton Bromswold in 1086. In addition to the arable land, there was  of meadows,  of woodland and a water mill at Leighton Bromswold.\n\nThe tax assessment in the Domesday Book was known as geld or danegeld and was a type of land-tax based on the hide or ploughland. Following the Norman Conquest, the geld was used to raise money for the King and to pay for continental wars; by 1130, the geld was being collected annually. Having determined the value of a manor's land and other assets, a tax of so many shillings and pence per pound of value would be levied on the land holder. While this was typically two shillings in the pound the amount did vary; for example, in 1084 it was as high as six shillings in the pound. For the manor at Leighton Bromswold the total tax assessed was 15 geld.\n\nNo church is recorded in the Domesday Book at Leighton Bromswold.\n\nThe village has at various times been known as \"Lecton\" (11th century), \"Leghton\" and \"Leghton upon Brouneswold\" (14th century).\n\nGovernance\nAs a civil parish, Leighton has a parish council. The parish council is the lowest tier of government in England and is elected by the residents on the electoral roll. A parish council is responsible for providing and maintaining a variety of local services including allotments and a cemetery; grass cutting and tree planting within public open spaces such as a village green or playing fields. The parish council reviews all planning applications that might affect the parish and makes recommendations to Huntingdonshire District Council, which is the local planning authority for the parish. The parish council also represents the views of the parish on issues such as local transport, policing and the environment. The parish council raises a parish precept, which is collected as part of the Council Tax. The parish council consists of five councillors.\n\nLeighton was in the historic and administrative county of Huntingdonshire until 1965. From 1965, the village was part of the new administrative county of Huntingdon and Peterborough. Then in 1974, following the Local Government Act 1972, Leighton became a part of the county of Cambridgeshire.\n\nThe second tier of local government is Huntingdonshire District Council which is a non-metropolitan district of Cambridgeshire and has its headquarters in Huntingdon. Huntingdonshire District Council has 52 councillors representing 29 district wards. Huntingdonshire District Council collects the council tax, and provides services such as building regulations, local planning, environmental health, leisure and tourism. Leighton is a part of the district ward of Ellington and is represented on the district council by one councillor. District councillors serve for four-year terms following elections to Huntingdonshire District Council.\n\nFor Leighton the highest tier of local government is Cambridgeshire County Council which has administration buildings in Cambridge. The county council provides county-wide services such as major road infrastructure, fire and rescue, education, social services, libraries and heritage services. Cambridgeshire County Council consists of 69 councillors representing 60 electoral divisions. Leighton is part of the electoral division of Sawtry and Ellington, represented by one councillor.\n\nLeighton is in the parliamentary constituency of North West Cambridgeshire, and elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. Leighton is represented in the House of Commons by Shailesh Vara (Conservative). Shailesh Vara has represented the constituency since 2005. The previous member of parliament was Brian Mawhinney (Conservative) who represented the constituency between 1997 and 2005.\n\nGeography\nThe parish of Leighton Bromswold contains , about half of which is arable and half grass land. Salome Wood is a plantation in the north of the parish, and there are one or two coppices. The soil is heavy and the subsoil is Oxford Clay. The land is undulating and is watered by two brooks, the one flowing from the west through the north and middle part of the parish; and the other, the Ellington Brook, flowing eastward through the southern part of the parish, forms the boundary for short distances. Between these brooks is a high ridge of land known as the Bromswold. On this ridge and also north of the northern brook the land rises to over  above Ordnance datum. From the ridge the land falls to about  to the southern brook and about  to the northern. The population was chiefly engaged in agriculture until the late 20th century.\n\nThe village is on the ridge between the two brooks and contains some 17th-century timber framed and plastered houses. The village street lies along the road to Old Weston, with Sheep Street branching off to the north east to Duck End, and Leighton Hill to the south. The church stands at the south-east end of the village, with the Manor Farm, formerly called Church Farm, to the west. South east of the church is the site of the Prebendal Manor House where in the Middle Ages the original village was located. The church is Grade I listed whilst there are seven Grade II listed buildings within the village.\n\nDemography\n\nPopulation\nIn the period 1801 to 1901 the population of Leighton was recorded every ten years by the UK census. During this time the population was in the range of 246 (the lowest was in 1811) and 455 (the highest was in 1851).\n\nFrom 1901, a census was taken every ten years with the exception of 1941 (due to the Second World War).\n\nAll population census figures from report Historic Census figures Cambridgeshire to 2011 by Cambridgeshire Insight.\n\nIn 2011, the parish covered an area of  and the population density of Leighton in 2011 was 43 persons per square mile (16.6 per square kilometre).\n\nLandmarks\n\nThe Leightonstone\n\nAlongside the Lych Gate of St Mary's Church stands the Leightonstone. It was originally situated to the south east of the Church, where the village originally stood. The Leightonstone is the ancient marker where the Moot Court of the Hundred of Leightonstone gathered to collect taxes and cast judgement of many local issues that were within the jurisdiction of the court.\n\nThe Leightonstone was actually sited on the other side of the church but to prevent it becoming lost or damaged it has been moved a few hundred metres to its present location by the church gate together with a commemorative plaque and seating.\n\nWar memorial\n\nThe limestone memorial takes the form of a small medieval-style Latin cross and plinth. The plinth has tracery decorative detail on each corner and flower motif in a band around the top. The names of the nine men from the parish who lost their lives fighting in the First World War are inscribed on the plinth and painted\nblack. The memorial is surrounded by concrete paving and wooden posts with chain link. The memorial was unveiled in 1920 and was the work of Mr Pettit of Godmanchester.\n\nThis memorial was a recipient of a grant from the Grants for War Memorials scheme in 2007. In 2009, War Memorials Trust applied for the listing of the war memorial cross. In March, the Trust was advised that the memorial has been listed at Grade II.\n\nThe castle gatehouse\n\nThis interesting earthwork, the site where Sir Gervase Clifton (died 1618) 'began to build a goodly house', is a grass field 600\u00a0ft. by 300\u00a0ft.enclosed on three sides by large banks averaging 35\u00a0ft. across the base, and being 4\u00a0ft. 6in. high within the enclosure but 10\u00a0ft. outside. On the west side, there is a slightly raised ridge which seems to indicate the line where a bank ran.\n\nAt the four corners and almost entirely outside the lines of the banks are curious circular bastions; that at the south-east corner is the best preserved, and is 80\u00a0ft. in diameter and its top rises 5\u00a0ft. above the bank; those at the other corners appear to have been the same but are not so well preserved. Wherever the edge of the banks and bastions has been cut into a line of broken red bricks, apparently of early date, is exposed, and it would therefore appear that these banks were made by Sir Gervase Clifton, who used the materials of an older house for the purpose.\n\nThe bastions were probably merely ornamental features and never intended for purposes of defence. The gatehouse of Sir Gervase Clifton's house, now a private residence, has a moat.\n\nSalome\n\nJust outside the village are some signs of a hamlet that has almost disappeared. The chapel of Salen is mentioned in 1248 (fn. 72) and in 1299 the question arose as to its being a sanctuary. In 1444 the sum of 16s. 8d. was paid 'pro le riggyng and redyng de la chapell, hall and le chaumbre' at Leighton Bromswold. The site is marked on a map by Thomas Norton (c. 1660) as a square inclosure at the north-west corner of Elecampane Close near the south-west angle of Salome Wood. Near it is a spot marked St Tellin (St Helen) Well. The inclosure is still represented by a slight mound and ditch, and excavations by Dr Garrood disclosed the foundations of the chapel, tiles, glazed pottery, fragments of medieval painted glass, and a coin of Gaucher de Porcein (1314\u20131329); while a damp depression in the ground nearby may represent the well.\n\nCulture and community\nThe village is home to the Green Man public house which was first licensed in 1650.\n\nThe village has a social programme. In July 2011 the village celebrated its charter to run a fair by holding a street party. The charter was given by William, treasurer of King John, who in 1211 obtained a charter for a fair to be held on the Feast of the Invention of the Holy Cross (3 May). There were later two fairs, one on May Day and the other on 24 September. Through the Leighton Bromswold Social Committee a number of other events were held in 2011 including a Safari Supper, Cheese & Wine Evening, trip to the seaside, music festival, Halloween and Bonfire, Senior Citizens' Lunch and Children's Party.\n\nSt Mary the Virgin's Church\n\nThe Grade I listed church of St Mary, Leighton Bromswold, consists of a chancel (\u00a0by  feet), nave (\u00a0by 24 feet), north transept (\u00a0by  feet), south transept (\u00a0by  feet), west tower (15\u00a0by 14 feet) and north and south porches. The walls are of coursed rubble with stone dressings, except the tower, which is faced with ashlar, and the roofs are covered with tiles and lead.\n\nThe church is not mentioned in the Domesday Survey (1086). A chancel and an aisled nave were built about 1250, but this chancel was apparently rebuilt about 1310, and large transepts were added to the nave some forty years later. Probably the aisles were partly rebuilt and new windows inserted in them, and perhaps a clerestory added to the nave towards the end of the 15th century. At the beginning of the 17th century the church was in a ruinous condition, and apparently about 1606 a rebuilding was commenced; the south arcade and aisle were pulled down and the south wall of an aisleless nave and south porch built. The work, however, was stopped for lack of funds, and for twenty years the church was 'so decayed, so little, and so useless, that the parishioners could not meet to perform their duty to God in public prayer and praises.' The roofs had fallen in, and the tower was in ruins as were the upper courses of the walls and the nave was roofless.\n\nChancel\nThe 14th-century chancel has a four-light east window with original jambs, but a late-15th-century depressed four-centred head; on the north side of it a 13th-century capital (now mutilated) has been built in as a bracket. The north wall has two original three-light windows with intersecting tracery in a two-centred head; a late-15th-century three-light window with a depressed four-centred head; and a 13th-century locker with trefoiled head and stone shelf. The south wall has three windows similar to those on the north; a small late-15th-century doorway; a blocked original doorway, only visible inside; a blocked low-side window; a reset 13th-century double piscina having one whole and two half semicircular intersecting arches with interpenetrating mouldings, carried on a central shaft and two detached jamb-shafts with moulded capitals and bases. The 13th-century chancel arch is two-centred, of two chamfered orders, the lower order resting on triple attached corbel-shafts with moulded capitals and modern corbels. The roof is modern, but the moulded principals of 1626 remain. The weathering of the earlier roof remains above the chancel arch.\n\nNave\nThe nave has, on each side of the chancel arch, the 13th-century respond column of the former arcades; they are semicircular with moulded capitals and bases. The 17th-century north wall has a reset late-15th-century three-light window; a reset 14th-century archway to the porch, of two chamfered orders (probably the old arch between the aisle and transept re-used), the lower order resting on mutilated corbels, reset and altered in the 17th century; and a slight recess close to the west end, as for the inner splay of a window. The 17th-century south wall has features similar to those of the north wall. Both walls have splayed plinths, but those on the south appear to be of rather coarse workmanship and do not extend round the porch, while those on the north are finely wrought and are carried along the east and west walls of the porch.\n\nNorth transept\n\nThe 14th-century north transept has a four-light east window with reticulated tracery in a two-centred head. The north wall has a late-15th-century three-light window with a depressed four-centred head. The west wall has, near its northern end, a blocked late-14th-century doorway; and at the southern end the weather stones of the early aisle roof remain. In the north transept are some 17th-century red and yellow glazed flooring tiles.\n\nSouth transept\n\nThe 14th-century south transept is similar to the north except that it has no doorway in the west wall. In the east wall is a rectangular shelf-bracket ornamented with ball-flowers and supported on a carved head. The south wall has a trefoiled-headed piscina and a rectangular locker.\n\nRoof\n\nThe roofs of the chancel, nave and transepts are all of 1626. In the chancel are five trusses with moulded tie beams, moulded and panelled braces and moulded wall-posts with shaped and moulded pendants. On the nave, six bays similar to the chancel with some repairs; transept roofs are similar each of three bays.\n\nThe 17th-century north porch has a mid-13th-century north doorway, perhaps the old door of the former aisle in situ; it has a two-centred head of three orders, the two outer orders springing from detached jamb-shafts with moulded capitals and bases and the inner order continuous. The porch has no buttresses, but the plinth of the nave is continued along its east and west walls.\n\nThe 17th-century south porch has a mid-13th-century south doorway, almost certainly rebuilt, as it does not seem to be quite on the line of the former aisle wall; it has a two-centred arch of three moulded orders enriched with dog-tooth ornament, and resting on four detached jamb-shafts on each side, having moulded capitals and bases. The east wall has a plain square-headed 17th-century window. The porch has buttresses square at the angles, probably largely of 13th-century material re-used.\n\nScreens\n\nUnder chancel-arch there is a low screen in two parts with opening in middle, plain lower panels and open upper panels, six on each side, with round arches springing from short turned balusters, moulded top rail and turned knobs over alternate balusters and flanking central opening; c. 1630\u201340. In south transept modern screen to vestry incorporating eleven bays of arcading probably from one of the stalls or seats, c. 1630\u201340. In the west tower across north west angle, curved screen or partition of moulded panelling, 16th-century, cornice and door modern now used as a store room.\n\nTwin pulpits\n\nThe two Pulpits date from 1626, are of oak and of the same general design, set against the two responds of the chancel-arch, each of pentagonal form with a short flight of steps, base having a series of short turned balusters connected by segmental arches and capped by a cornice, the whole continued outwards as a rail to the stairs; upper part of pulpit, each face divided into two bays by turned columns with moulded bases and capitals from which spring segmental arches and the whole finished with an entablature; door similar but with one half-column only, between the bays and with strap-hinges; sounding-board resting on panelled standard at back with two attached pilasters; board finished with an entablature with segmental arches below and turned pendants, boarded soffit with turned pendant in middle.\n\nBenches\n\nIn the nave there are fourteen benches, upper parts of backs with a series of panels formed by attached half-balusters, with moulded top rail, open ends with turned terminals and curved armrests, supported by turned balusters, c. 1630\u201340, made up with some modern work. In north transept-six benches generally similar to those in nave but with open arcaded backs formed by segmental arches resting on turned balusters, also one front enclosure of similar design and two benches at east end of nave, c. 1630\u201340. In chancel-four stalls similar to the benches in the north transept, but with half-balusters attached to the lower panelling, made up with modern work.\n\nLectern\n\nThe modern lectern (1903) incorporates some oak balusters and knobs from the staircase of Stow Longa Manor House and was given in memory of Rev. Thomas Ladd who was buried in the churchyard in 1899.\n\nWest tower\n\nIt is generally believed that the west tower was built by James Stewart, 1st Duke of Richmond in 1634, however there is no authority for this. In the July of that year he was just 12 when he succeeded the Dukedom on the death of his father Esm\u00e9 Stewart. His mother, Katherine Clifton of Leighton Bromswold continued to hold the titles and the lordship until her own death in September 1637. There is also the suggestion that John Ferrar produced a 'ruff draught' for a tower after 1634 with the note \"for the finishing of Layton church that he might the better in time provide\".\n\nJames, Duke of Lennox, Earl of March, Baron Clifton of Leighton Bromswold was at the height of his powers in 1641 and it was probable that the tower was completed before or in that year. On the parapet are the initials 'R.D. 1641', probably made by Richard Drake, a long-standing friend of Nicholas Ferrar. In 1655 it was recorded that \"Only the steeple could not be compassed wch afterwards the most Noble, Religious, worthy good Duke of Lenox did perform at his own proper cost & charges, to the Memorial of his Honor.\"\n\nThe tower is of three stages finished with a modillioned cornice between the buttresses, an embattled parapet and angle pedestals, supporting obelisks with ball-terminals. The two-centred tower-arch is of two classically moulded orders springing from square responds with moulded imposts. The west window is of two coupled lights divided and flanked by plain pilasters and with round heads, moulded archivolts and imposts; the west doorway is flanked by plain pilasters with moulded capitals, and has a half-round moulded arch with a plain keystone; above the doorway is a plain tablet.\n\nThe second stage has in the west wall a square-headed window with a moulded stone architrave. The bell-chamber has in each wall a double window similar to, but larger than, the west window of the ground-stage; above each pair of windows is a lozenge-shaped panel.\n\nThe stairs to the belfry are at the south-west corner. In the north-eastern corner of the tower is a modern disused brick chimney. On the tower floor is the matrix of a 15th-century monumental brass with the figure of a man and an inscription plate. In 1552 there were four bells and a sanctus bell.\n\nBells\n\nWithin the west tower are five bells dating 1641 and 1720. The bells were rehung, in a new frame, in 1902 by Barwell of Birmingham and a brass plaque commemorating the event is on the north wall of the nave. \nThe biggest bell weighs 21hundredweight 1 quarter and 4 pounds making it the 3rd heaviest ring of 5 bells in the country. They hang in a 6 bell frame (6.1) with space for a new treble.\nMore info: http://dove.cccbr.org.uk/detail.php?searchString=Leighton+Bromswold&Submit=+Go+&DoveID=LEIGHTONBR\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nBrackets in chancel east wall, in form of moulded capital, late-13th-century, now cut back to wall-face. In south transept east wall, rectangular shelf with 'ball-flower' ornament and a carved head below, early-14th-century\n\nCommunion Table: with turned legs, moulded top rails with shaped brackets, plain lower rails, c. 1630\u201340, top modern.\n\nThere are two chairs in the chancel with moulded and twisted legs, front rail, and back-uprights, of c. 1700. A 16th-century chest is in the north transept and is plain with coped lid, two locks, iron straps and three strap\u00achinges, all terminating in fleurs-de-lis.\n\nThe font is made up of two 13th-century circular moulded capitals and a piece of circular shaft. The cover is largely modern, but has a 17th-century ball on the top and a Victorian mounting.\n\nIn the nave the north and south doorways, the doors are twinned, each of two leaves with moulded panels and nail-studded framing; both doors set in moulded framing, with panelling above, mid-17th-century, partly repaired.\n\nThe Lockers in chancel north wall, with rebated jambs and trefoiled head, stone division or shelf, late 13th\u00accentury. In south transept south wall, rectangular, with chamfered and rebated reveals, 14th-century.\n\nIn chancel, on the south wall, there is a double piscinae. with two-centred arches the moulding continued to form an intersecting arcade, free shaft to each jamb and in middle, with moulded capitals and bases, shelves within the recess, at level of abaci of side-shafts, two multifoiled drains, mid-13th-century, reset. In south transept in the south wall, there is a recess with trefoiled head and round drain, 14th-century.\n\nRainwater heads\n\nRainwater-heads are in lead. On north and south walls of chancel there are four, three with embattled tops and painted decoration, curved junction with down-pipes, on one of which is a fleur-de-lis; one head on south side elaborately shaped, with enriched cornice and cresting, the date 1632, and strap-work ornament on the flanges, junction with down-pipe enriched with acanthus ornament, down-pipe with strap-work ornament and enriched straps with three crests. On the north wall of north transept two shaped heads with embattled tops, the two heads bearing together the date 1634. On north wall of nave, head with arabesque ornament and painted decoration; on south wall, with rounded and moulded head. On south wall of south transept, two similar to those on north transept, but with painted decoration and no date, all 17th-century.\n\nAltar-tombs\n\nIn the north transept is an alabaster altar-tomb with mutilated effigies of Sir Robert Tyrwhitt, who died on 10 May 1572 in Leighton Bromswold, and Elizabeth, his last wife who died in 1578. Altar-tomb of alabaster, south side divided into three bays by ornamental pilasters, shield in middle bay with arms three tirwhitts for Tyrwhitt quartering a chief indented, the whole impaling a lion rampant with a forked tail and a border, figures of daughter and two swaddled infants in side bays; similar pilasters west end of tomb, forming two bays each with a shield bearing the quarterly coat above and the impaled coat; on tomb, recumbent effigies of man and wife, man in plate-armour with head on mantled helm and lion at feet, legs of man missing; effigy of wife in French cap, long cloak,\n\nAlso in the north transept, further west, is a mutilated alabaster effigy of probably Katherine, the 4th daughter of Sir Robert and Elizabeth, and wife of Sir Henry D'Arcy, died 1567, head on two cushions, hands broken, modern altar-tomb with old alabaster plinth, mid- to late-16th-century.\n\nLying loose, close to these monuments, is a broken stone crest. There is also a monument of Sir Robert Tyrwhitt and his wife Elizabeth Oxenbridge in Bigby church, Lincolnshire, dated 1581, which unlike the monument in Leighton church, included effigies of all his twenty-two children.\n\nWorshipful Company of Dyers\n\nIn the Church box a letter was discovered, dated 1947, confirming that the effigies were of Sir Robert Tyrwhitt, the first benefactor of the Worshipful Company of Dyers, and that if ever the effigies could be restored, the Dyers Company would be interested to help. A letter was despatched appealing to them for help and telling them of the efforts of this small parish of 220 souls, including all denominations. The Worshipful Company of Dyers very generously offered to relieve the village of its financial burden and pay off the remainder of the money by Deed of Covenant.\n\nThere is engraved graffiti scratching on the tower parapet, R.D. 1641; on doorway of bell-chamber, W.H. R.I. 1666; on wall of second stage, E.S. 1653.\n\nThere are the following monuments: in the chancel, to the Rev. Thomas Ladds, vicar, died 1899; in the nave, to Ernest Cook, died 1917, Wilfred Barwell, died 1918; Lewis Robert Jellis, died 1933; in the south transept, to Hugh Brawn, died 1917; in the tower, floor slab to William Chapman, died 1687.\n\nHerbert's restoration\nRev. George Herbert (1593\u20131633) was presented with the Prebendary of Leighton in 1626, whilst he was a don at Trinity College, Cambridge. He was not even present at his institution as prebend as it is recorded that Peter Walker, his clerk, stood in as his proxy. In the same year that his close Cambridge friend Nicholas Ferrar was ordained Deacon in Westminster Abbey by Bishop Laud on Trinity Sunday 1626 and, two miles down the road from Leighton Bromswold, founded the Little Gidding community.\n\nNo religious offices had been said in the church for over twenty years, Izaak Walton wrote - 'so decayed, so little, and so useless, that the parishioners could not meet to perform their duty to God in public prayer and praises'. Although during that time it is recorded that John Barber MA in 1607 and Maurice Hughes MA in 1623 were described as taking up their duties as vicars of St Mary's Leighton Bromswold and it probable at this it is said that the Lord Lennox's barn was used for divine service.\n\nPermission from the Crown had been obtained by the previous incumbent to re-build the church at a cost of \u00a32,000 (approximately \u00a31,000,000 in today's money)\n\nTo raise this money was too daunting so George Herbert asked Nicholas Ferrar to help rebuild the ruined church but Nicholas was fully occupied with his community, so he suggested that his brother, John Ferrar, should supervise the rebuilding whilst Herbert, for his part, should try and raise the money amongst his influential friends. Which he achieved. \u00a350 from William, Earl of Pembroke; \u00a3200 from Catherine Clifford, daughter of Lord Clifton of Leighton Bromswold; some money from Lord Manchester and Lord Bolingbroke and also from Henry Herbert, George's brother, Donations, small and great, came from here and there. The actual rebuilding was supervised by John Ferrar, and Arthur Wodenoth, a wealthy gold merchant, who was also a subscriber, acted as Treasurer and during John Ferrar absence as his deputy.\n\nIt is recorded later (by John Ferrar in 1632) that there were 18 masons and labourers and 10 carpenters at work during the reconstruction and that 'all was finished inside and out, not only to ye Parishioners own much comfort and joy, but to the admiration of all men, how such a structure should be raysed and brought to pass by Mr Herbert'.\n\nShortly after 1626 the work was completed by pulling down the north arcade and aisle and building the north wall of the new aisleless nave and the north porch; he re-roofed the whole church and put in the pulpit, reading desk, dwarf screen and seating.\n\nIn 1630, three years before his death, he entered priesthood and took up his duties as rector of the little parish of Fugglestone St Peter with Bemerton St Andrew, near Salisbury in Wiltshire. It is probable that George Herbert never saw the results of his efforts.\n\nPerhaps a fitting epitaph for the faithful of St Mary's and George Herbert are the words written in Izaac Walton's book on Herbert's life (1670). He said: \"Allow that Herbert in the body never looked on Leighton Church, never worshipped God in its aisles; Leighton Church was very dear to Herbert's heart: it was hallowed by his prayers, it was washed by his tears. It is ever to be remembered as incensed by his memory.\"\n\nWalton's Lives 1796\n\nFrom a note to a 1796 edition of Walton's Lives, quoted in H. B. Maling, 'Leighton Bromswold, the Church and Lordship'. \nIt appears from a recent survey of this church, that the reading desk is on the right hand in the nave, just as you enter the chancel, and that is height is seven feet, four inches; and that the pulpit is on the left hand, and exactly of the same height. They are both pentagonal. The church is at present paved with bricks; the roofs bother of the church and chancel tiles, and not under drawn or ceiled. There are no communion rails; but, as you advance to the communion table you ascend three steps. The windows are large and handsome, with some small remnants of painted glass. The seats and pews both in the nave, the cross-aisles, and the chancel, somewhat resemble the stalls in cathedrals, but are very simple, with little or no ornament, nearly alike, and formed of oak. It was evidently the intention of Mr Herbert that in his church there should be no distinction between the seats of the rich and those of the poor. During Divine Service the men have from time immemorial been accustomed to sit on the south side of the Nave, and the women on the north side. In the cross-aisles the male servants sit on the south side, and the female servants on the north side.\n\n1868 survey\n\nIn October 1868 Ewan Christian surveyed the church on behalf of the Commissioners and commented that\nThe interior of the church is well white-washed as to its walls, but being open to the tiles has a bare and barn like look. The tower is blocked off by a gallery, which greatly damages the internal appearance. The nave and transepts still retain the benches of the 17th century, but the wood floors under these are to some extent decayed, and the benches themselves need repair. The chancel was also benched in the same way, but a few years ago the benches were removed into the transepts and large square pews of high deal framing erected in their stead. They are very unsightly and ought to be removed. The pulpit and the desk are also of the 17th century, each of the same height and each has a sounding board over head. The chancel has a plain balustrade rail comparatively modern and both ugly, and wrongly placed.\n\nAs a result, the paving in the chancel was renewed, the square chancel pews being converted into benches with some modern material, (this can clearly be seen in the front westward chancel bench, where the turnings and woodwork are of similar, but different design and texture) and wooden floors modified with some new woodwork into its current configuration and the benches were removed into the transepts. Work was also carried out in the nave and transepts, improving the wooden floors and benches and providing some new ones, also new steps and paving for the passage, restuccoing walls and repairing the old pulpits and desk as well as removing the gallery and opening the tower, restoring old doors and the gate.\n\nThe church was restored in 1870 as a result of Christian's survey. The children's pews at the west end of the nave were installed in 1870 as a result of a request from the vicar Rev. Thomas Ladd at a cost of \u00a318 at which time the font was mounted.\n\nThe original globe electric lights were installed in June 1900 (they were dismantled and are currently stored in the north west of the tower) and replaced in the 1990s by sodium industrial lighting which remains to this day, at the same time the heating system was replaced.\n\nOriginally it was headed by wood burner in the west tower drafting hot air down the centre of the nave where the cast iron grilling can still be seen. Later it was converted to low-wattage oil-filled electric pipe heating under selected benches and finally with medium-wavelength infra-red heaters in the chancel only. Currently there is no heating in the church.\n\nIn 1914 the tie beam in the chancel was cut out and replaced by an iron rod, drawing by Inskipp Ladds, but in 1914 the vicar, Rev. John Cooper, commented that the tie beam is 'a real eyesore disfiguring as it does the east window and hiding the tracery.' An additional tie beam was added across the east face of the west tower.\n\nModern upkeep\n\nIn 1961 the Ely Diocesan Board asked for a quinquennial inspection report to be prepared by John Gedge, architect. This was presented to the parochial church council, and the estimated cost was \u00a38,000. The architect, stressing that such a large amount from such a small parish would be impossible to raise, suggested the more important items of roof and gutters should have top priority.\n\nOne member of the parochial church council wrote to the Church Commissioners asking if St Mary's, Leighton Bromswold had a lay rector. To this query, came answer that they held this office and were solely responsible for the repair and upkeep of the chancel. This part of the restoration was carried out for the Church Commissioners by John Allen & Co., Brampton at the figure of \u00a35,500. The architect, Major Gedge, set the target figure of \u00a33,000 to cover the remainder of the work on the restoration of the church.\n\nThe Leighton Village Fund for Church Restoration was opened in 1962. On 28 July 1962 a barbecue dance was staged in the village field and a fete down the village street added another \u00a3358. The following year, 1963, another barbecue dance, in a barn and another fete added a further \u00a3225 and in 1964 another \u00a3199 was made from a fete. Altogether, with donations and other efforts, a total of \u00a3901 was made.\n\nThe Historic Churches Preservation Trust donated \u00a3500, Church Commissioners gave \u00a350. The two Restoration Appeal Funds were closed in September 1964 having reached the target of \u00a33,000.\n\nDuring the winter of 1964, a farmer sent his men and they removed from the churchyard an estimated 100 tons of soil so that the level of the ground outside the church is at least 6\u00a0inches lower than the floor inside. A 24-inch-wide trench,  to 2 feet deep, was dug all round the church and was refilled with 95 tons of gravel to assist drainage and prevent damp rising in the church. The old drainage system was exposed and renewed where necessary. The gravel was given and carted from Thrapston by the farmer and also red bank drainage tiles.\n\nOn 3 June 1965, the Bishop of Ely, lead a thanksgiving service to commemorate the completion of the work with the Choir of St John's, Cambridge and the Ely Diocesan Bellringers. It was televised by BBC TV.\n\nLych gate\n\nThe lych gate was built in 1893. It was dedicated to the memory of George Smith, sometime churchwarden and buried in the churchyard, by his widow, Margaret in 1909.\n\nClock\n\nOriginally, a provision was made on all four sides of Leighton church tower for square clock faces set lozenge-style, recalling similar clocks on the St Gregory Tower at St Paul's and the western turret at Covent Garden (neither of which are still in existence). There are additional similarities in the design of the west tower to these two churches, in particular the parallel windows of the ringing chamber, though there is no evidence to suggest that there was any formal connection. However, as built, the west tower has a single clock face on the west face of the tower.\n\nIn 1977 the church clock winding system was electrified at a cost of \u00a3365. This was to save someone climbing up narrow winding stone steps to the Clock Tower floor and winding up two sets of mechanisms, striking and timing, 5 times in fourteen days. The necessary wiring was installed in May 1976 enabling the work to commence.\n\nFor the clock, the work consisted of a RPH50C motor and Junior winder weighing approximately 16 pounds with overload protection and regulator. A 16-tooth split chain and 10 feet of one-half-inch pitch roller chain with idler and chain adjuster. For the strike, the installation consisted of a RPH50AC motor and Mark II winder weighing approximately 40 pounds with overload protection and regulator. A 16-tooth split chain and 35 feet of one-half-inch pitch roller chain with idler and chain adjuster. The clock was also cleaned and repainted with the internal dial re-lacquered. The work was carried out by the inventor of the system, David Gamble of Eaton Socon and consists of a small electric motor clamped to weights and geared with sprockets onto a continuous chain. As the weight operates the clock mechanism by pulling downwards, the electric motor monkey is climbing up the chain at the same speed, so that the weight never has to be cranked back to the top.\n\nChantry\n\nThere was a chantry at Leighton Bromswold apparently in the church, which was founded by Master Gilbert Smith, Archdeacon of Northampton, and endowed with a pension payable by St Andrew's Priory, Northampton.\n\nThe church's gatehouse was built in the 15th century and is the only part of a mansion designed by John Thorpe for the Duke of Lennox that was actually completed.\n\nNotable residents\nNicholas Grimald (1519\u20131562), the poet, was supposed to have been born in Leighton Bromswold.\n\nThe Spanish Armada Muster Call of Captain Wanton's men happened on 2 August 1588; those mustered included two pikemen, Richard Clarke and Nick Colton, both from Leighton Bromswold.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n The parish of Leighton Bromswold\n\nVillages in Cambridgeshire\nCivil parishes in Cambridgeshire\nHuntingdonshire", "machine_text": "Leighton Bromswold is a civil parish situated near Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, England. It is a small village that comprises a community of around 300 people. The parish contains a historic church, St Mary's Church, which dates back to the 11th century. Leighton Bromswold is known for its peaceful atmosphere, picturesque surroundings, and rich history. The name \"Bromswold\" means \"the place where broom grows\" in Old English.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Sempronius Densus\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Sempronius Densus was a centurion in the Praetorian Guard in the 1st century. He was bodyguard to the deputy emperor, and is remembered by history for his courage and loyalty in singlehandedly defending his charge from scores of armed assassins, while all his comrades deserted or switched sides.\n\nConspiracy\nOn January 10, 69 C.E., emperor Galba chose a man to become his deputy and heir. One of Galba's advisors had led Marcus Otho to expect to be appointed to this office, but instead Galba chose one Piso Licinianus. This unexpected choice led Otho to conspire to assassinate both of them and seize power.\n\nAssassination and death\nOn January 15 Otho struck. Galba and Piso were being carried on litters through the street when they were accosted by a large company of renegade Praetorians in Otho's employ. The Praetorians were supposed to be the personal bodyguard of the emperor, but now they intended his death. Of all the soldiers present, only Sempronius Densus, who had been assigned by Galba to guard Piso, stood firm, while his colleagues either joined in the murder or melted away. While Piso fled to seek a safe hiding place, Sempronius bought him time to escape, first remonstrating with the assassins and then fighting them to the death.\n\nAt this point sources differ slightly. According to Plutarch, Sempronius gave his life defending both Galba and Piso:\n\nAfter Sempronius finally fell, the assassins surrounded Galba and killed him.\n\nTacitus however describes Galba's death as occurring first in the order of events, followed by the centurion's last stand, in which Sempronius uses a pugio.\n\nDio Cassius simply relates:\n\nSuetonious entirely omits the death of Sempronius from his accounts on the deaths of Galba and Piso.\n\nOutcome\nHowever, all of the sources agree on what happened next. While most of the assassins hacked Galba's corpse to pieces and paraded his severed head on a pole, two of them sought out Piso, who had taken refuge in the Temple of Vesta. They dragged him outside and killed him at the door.\n\nAround 120 people later claimed credit for killing Galba and Piso, hoping that Otho would reward them. However, in April that year Otho was deposed by Vitellius, who replaced him as emperor. Vitellius found the list of their names and ordered them all executed. He also disbanded the Praetorian Guard (although the Guard was reinstated by the next emperor, Vespasian).\n\nAlthough ultimately unsuccessful, Sempronius Densus's last stand is recorded by historians as being the only heroic act done in Rome that day.\n\nReferences\n\n69 deaths\n1st-century Romans\nAncient Roman murder victims\nBodyguards\nMembers and leaders of the Praetorian Guard\nPeople of the Year of the Four Emperors\nYear of birth unknown\nSempronii", "machine_text": "Sempronius Densus was a prominent Roman politician and military figure who lived during the Republican era. He was born in the late 3rd century BCE and belonged to the plebeian gens Sempronia. Densus served as a consul twice and held several other important positions in the Roman government and military during his career. Densus's first consulship was in 254 BCE, during the First Punic War against Carthage. He and his colleague, Lucius Caecilius Metellus, were tasked with mobilizing troops and coordinating the war effort against the Carthaginians. Densus played a key role in the Roman victory at Panormus (modern-day Palermo) in Sicily, where he commanded the left wing of the Roman army. Densus's second consulship was in 252 BCE, during the same war. This time, he was paired with Marcus Servilius Structus. Densus distinguished himself again in battle, this time leading the Roman cavalry in the defeat of the Carthaginian general, Hasdrubal. For his military achievements, Densus was awarded a triumph upon his return to Rome. In addition to his military achievements, Densus was also an active politician and reformer. He advocated for the rights of the plebeians and worked to limit the power of the patrician aristocracy. Densus also supported the establishment of the first public baths in Rome, which were seen as a symbol of civic pride and a way to promote hygiene and health. Despite his political and military success, Densus fell out of favor with the Roman people towards the end of his life. He was accused of corruption and embezzlement and was exiled from Rome. Densus died in obscurity, but his legacy as a skilled military commander and reformer was remembered by later generations of Romans.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 4726772}

Wine is a complex mixture of hundreds of chemical compounds, many of which have a significant impact on its aroma, flavor, and color. Understanding wine chemistry is important for winemakers and wine enthusiasts alike, as it helps to explain the origin and characteristics of different wine types. The chemistry of wine begins with the grapes themselves. The type of grape, its growing conditions, and the timing of harvest all influence the chemical composition of the resulting wine. Grapes contain a variety of organic compounds such as sugars, acids, phenolics, and aroma compounds. During fermentation, yeast consumes the grape sugars and produces alcohol, carbon dioxide, and other byproducts, which further influence the chemical makeup of the wine. One of the most important chemical compounds in wine is ethanol, which is responsible for its alcoholic content. Other key compounds include acids such as tartaric, malic, and citric acid, which contribute to the wine's sourness and balance. Tannins, which are found primarily in red wines, provide astringency and bitterness, while aroma compounds such as esters, alcohols, and terpenes contribute to the wine's scent. The chemistry of wine also plays a crucial role in its production and storage. Many winemaking techniques are focused on controlling the chemical reactions that occur during fermentation, aging, and bottling. For example, adding sulfur dioxide to wine during fermentation can prevent the growth of harmful bacteria, while aging in oak barrels can introduce additional flavor compounds and tannins. In conclusion, wine chemistry is a fascinating area of study that sheds light on the many complex chemical processes that occur during wine production and storage. By understanding the key chemical compounds in wine and the factors that influence their formation, winemakers and wine enthusiasts can gain a deeper appreciation for the art and science of winemaking.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 32186253}

The film takes place in the Philippines in 1900 during the Philippine\u2013American War.\n\nPlot\nAmigo centers on Rafael Dacanay, kapitan of the fictional barrio of San Isidro in a rice-growing area of Luzon. His brother Sim\u00f3n, head of the local guerrilla band, has forced the surrender of the Spanish guardia civil outpost and charged Rafael with the task of imprisoning the guardia Captain and the barrio\u2019s Spanish friar, Padre Hidalgo, in the name of the First Philippine Republic. But when the American troops chasing General Emilio Aguinaldo arrive, the Spanish officer and Padre Hidalgo are freed, and a garrison under the command of Lieutenant Ike Compton is left to \"protect\" the barrio. The American occupation policy now changes from \"hearts and minds\" to \"concentration\" (what was called \"hamletting\" during the Vietnam war) and Rafael has to answer to both the Americans and the Filipino nationalists, with deadly consequences.\n\nCast\n\nDevelopment\nCinematical reports that the film was once titled Baryo, and that the idea for it came from a yet-to-be-published novel Some Time in the Sun, detailing U.S. imperialism in the Philippines.\nThe book will actually be called A Moment in the Sun, though the unrealized screenplay which inspired it was called Some Time in the Sun.\n\nThe screenplay was written in two weeks and it was filmed over eight months on the island province of Bohol.\n\nSayles said the \"amigo\" of the title was the mayor:\nThe American soldiers were always asked, \u201cIs he a good amigo or a bad amigo?\u201d There was some irony to him being called an amigo.

Forty-eight percent is in English, 48 percent is in Tagalog, and there\u2019s a little Cantonese and Spanish thrown in. So the audience is asked to do something they\u2019re not normally asked in a chronological war movie, which is to spend time with all the combatants and the noncombatants. They, therefore, know more than any, one character does. That affects the structure as well, but there is just a structure of events. But how you feel about those events is different because you get to be on both sides and actually care about people on both sides.

The main character of the film is Rafael Dacanay, the village leader of San Isidro. He made a difficult choice to welcome the Americans to his village as he believed that having good relations with the occupiers would mean less harm to their village. However, his choice is met with criticism from some of his villagers as they feel that he has betrayed his own people. Rafael, in turn, must navigate through his leadership and decision while maintaining relationships with both the locals and Americans. Amigo touched on the themes of colonialism, power dynamics, and cultural differences and its effects on the people. It showed that even with the best intentions, conflicts and misunderstandings can cause great harm. The film was applauded for its exceptional performances from Joel Tamayo as Rafael Dacanay, Chris Cooper as Colonel Hardacre, and especially Yul Vazquez, who portrayed a complex character of a Filipino who had joined the American forces. The film's visuals were praised for its authenticity in depicting the lives of the villagers in the 1900s in the Philippines.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"NDISwrapper\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "NDISwrapper is a free software driver wrapper that enables the use of Windows XP network device drivers (for devices such as PCI cards, USB modems, and routers) on Linux operating systems. NDISwrapper works by implementing the Windows kernel and NDIS APIs and dynamically linking Windows network drivers to this implementation.  As a result, it only works on systems based on the instruction set architectures supported by Windows, namely IA-32 and x86-64.\n\nNative drivers for some network adapters are not available on Linux as some manufacturers maintain proprietary interfaces and do not write cross-platform drivers. NDISwrapper allows the use of Windows drivers, which are available for virtually all modern PC network adapters.\n\nUse  \nThere are three steps: Creating a Linux driver, installing it, and using it. NDISwrapper is composed of two main parts, a command-line tool used at installation time and a Windows subsystem used when an application calls the Wi-Fi subsystem.\n\nAs the outcome of an NDISwrapper installation should be some sort of Linux driver to be able to work with Linux applications, the first action the user does is to \"compile\" a couple or more of Windows files, and the NDISwrapper's version of Windows DDK into a Linux Kernel Module. This is done with a tool named \"ndiswrapper\". The resultant linux driver is then installed (often manually) in the OS. A Linux application can then send request to this Linux driver that automatically does the needed adaptations to call its\u2014now\u2014internal Windows driver and DDK.\n\nTo achieve this \"compilation\" NDISwrapper requires at least the \".inf\" and the \".sys\" files invariably supplied as parts of the Windows driver.  For example, if the driver is called \"mydriver\", with the files mydriver.inf and mydriver.sys and vendorid:productid 0000:0000, then NDISwrapper installs the driver to /etc/ndiswrapper/mydriver/.  This directory contains three files:\n 0000:0000.conf, which contains information extracted from the inf file\n mydriver.inf (the original inf file)\n mydriver.sys (the driver file)\n\nGraphical frontends \n\nThere are graphical frontends to NDISwrapper, such as Ndisgtk and NdisConfig, which allow NDISwrapper to be installed using a graphical user interface rather than console commands.\n\nArchitecture \nNDISwrapper enables a Unix-like system to use Windows drivers of type NDIS and WIFI.\nIt was useful at a time where there were no Linux Wi-Fi drivers for common Wi-Fi cards.\nIt is composed of:\n An NDIS driver, which is a kind of overlay for Ethernet device drivers.\n A Wi-Fi manager, to control the radio and security part of the Wi-Fi card. It exposes a \"wireless extension\" interface.\n A USB manager and a PnP manager to make it possible to use Wi-Fi card embedded in USB sticks. The USB manager is composed of two parts, first a tiny USBD implementation (USB stack) then a simple Windows Driver Model (WDM) USB driver that is itself composed of two parts: The front part will receive calls from the NDISwrapper USB stack (in fact from calls coming from the original Windows driver that were normally intended to go to the Windows USB stack) and the rear part is using Linux USB stack.\n A minimal Ntoskrnl simulating the DDK for:\n managing calls from the Windows driver.\n managing IRP to the Windows driver (WDM only at the moment)\n managing filter drivers in a simplistic way\n loading/unloading Windows drivers\n A wrapper converting Linux calls to Windows and the other way round, also managing results and error codes\n\nHow it works \nNdiswrapper uses Windows INF files.\n\nWhen a Linux application calls a device which is registered on Linux as an NDISwrapper device, the NDISwrapper determines which Windows driver is targeted. It then converts the Linux query into Windows parlance, it calls the Windows driver, waits for the result and translates it into Linux parlance then sends the result back to the Linux application.\nIt's possible from a Linux driver (NDISwrapper is a Linux driver) to call a Windows driver because they both execute in the same address space (the same as the Linux kernel).\nIf the Windows driver is composed of layered drivers (for example one for Ethernet above one for USB) it's the upper layer driver which is called, and this upper layer will create new calls (IRP in Windows parlance) by calling the \"mini ntoskrnl\". So the \"mini ntoskrnl\" must know there are other drivers, it must have registered them in its internal database a priori by reading the Windows \".inf\" files.\n\nSimilar programs \nDriverLoader is a commercial tool produced by Linuxant for Linux which seems to provide the same functionality as NDISwrapper.\nIndependently of but roughly simultaneously with the NDISwrapper project, Bill Paul of Wind River Systems developed a similar system, known as Project Evil or The NDISulator, for FreeBSD.  It has since been ported to DragonFly BSD and NetBSD.\n\nLimitations \n NDISwrapper relies on the elderly \"wireless-extensions\" to enable applications to access Wi-Fi.\n As NDISwrapper relies on Windows drivers; it only supports i386 and x86_64 architectures.\n NDISwrapper does not implement NDIS 6 (Windows Vista version) yet, limiting drivers to Windows XP. , a code branch at the project site has been under development since 2006, but a feature request from 2009 has been left unassigned.\n\nWhile it is not a major problem for the x86 architecture because of the popularity of Windows XP x86-32, many vendors choose to make 64-bit driver versions only for Windows Vistawhich means that Linux systems using the x86-64 architecture are unable to use such networking devices (they can neither use XP x86-32 NDIS5 because they are 64bits systems nor NDIS6 64bit drivers because they can't use NDIS6). It's still possible to use Windows XP 64 bit drivers which implement NDIS5, however, there are fewer available drivers for xp64 (NDIS5/64 bit) than for XP32 (NDIS5/32 bit).\n\n Since 2006, most Windows drivers are compliant with Windows Driver Foundation (WDF) which NDISWrapper can't use. It renders NDISWrapper obsolete, as it only supports the previous WDM driver framework.\n\nSee also \n\n List of wireless router firmware projects\n cabextract\n DebWRT\n INF file\n LibreWRT\n Linux Unified Kernel\n ReactOS\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n NDISwrapper Wiki\n NDISwrapper Download Area\n NDISwrapper Installation \u2013 An easy to follow video showing how to install NDISwrapper and get started with it.\n Ndisgtk\n NdisConfig\n Project Evil: The Evil Continues, 2004-01-24, Bill Paul on a FreeBSD mailing list\n Too Evil, Too Furious, 2005-04-25, Bill Paul on a FreeBSD mailing list\n NetBSD NDIS Driver Port\n\nDevice drivers\nCompatibility layers", "machine_text": "NDISwrapper is an open-source software compatibility layer that enables the use of Windows Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS) network device drivers on Linux operating systems. It was created by the Linux community in response to the lack of official Linux drivers for many popular wireless network adapters. NDISwrapper works by using the NDIS API to redirect requests made by Linux kernel mode drivers to the corresponding Windows NDIS drivers. This allows Linux to use these Windows drivers as if they were native Linux drivers, making it easy to install and configure wireless network adapters on Linux systems. NDISwrapper can be used in two modes: the \"wrapper\" mode and the \"bridge\" mode. In the \"wrapper\" mode, NDISwrapper creates a Linux device driver that interacts with the Windows NDIS driver, while in the \"bridge\" mode, NDISwrapper bridges network traffic between a Windows driver and Linux native drivers. NDISwrapper has several advantages, the most significant being its ability to provide support for a large number of wireless network adapters that do not have native Linux drivers. This makes it an ideal solution for Linux users who may be looking for a way to use their Windows-compatible wireless network adapters with their Linux operating system. Additionally, NDISwrapper's compatibility layer is relatively lightweight, making it suitable for use with older or less powerful hardware. In conclusion, NDISwrapper is an invaluable tool for Linux users who need to utilize wireless networks. Its open-source development ensures it will always be up-to-date with the latest technologies and can be accessed by anyone in need. With its low-resource usage and compatibility with a broad range of devices, it remains an excellent option for Linux users to access their preferred wireless networks.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2646593}

He was a pioneer of abstract art in Iceland and his works are now part of many collections, both in Iceland and internationally. Karlson was born in Reykjavik in 1925. He displayed an interest in art from an early age, and after finishing his studies at the Secondary School in Reykjavik, he attended the Icelandic College of Art and Crafts. In 1947, he traveled to Denmark to study at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen. It was here that he began to explore the world of abstract art. Throughout his career, Karlson created a large body of work that explored the relationship between color, form, and texture. His early paintings often depicted landscapes, but as his career progressed, he turned towards abstraction. He was known for his use of vibrant colors and the exploration of light and shadow. In the 1960s, Karlson began to create sculptures in addition to his paintings. Using materials such as wood, copper, and stone, he created dynamic and striking works that were often inspired by Icelandic nature. His sculptures were also characterized by his use of unusual shapes and the incorporation of negative space. Karlson\u2019s work has been exhibited in numerous solo exhibitions in Iceland and abroad. He was also awarded the Order of the Falcon in 1995, one of Iceland\u2019s highest honors. Gunnar Karlson died in Reykjavik in 2011.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Chris Greetham\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Christopher Herbert Millington Greetham (28 August 1936 \u2013 13 March 2017) played first-class cricket for Somerset from 1957 to 1966 as a middle-order batsman and a medium-pace bowler.  Greetham was a tall, fair-haired right-handed batsman usually used in Somerset's late middle order and a right-arm seam bowler who, for a couple of seasons in the early 1960s, took enough wickets to be classed as an all-rounder. He was considered a good cover fielder, with a strong and accurate throw.\n\nCareer\nHe first played for Somerset in 1957 and became a regular player in 1959, when he hit 881 runs in the season and made his highest first-class score, an unbeaten 151 in the match against the Combined Services. One week after this innings, he made a second century, 104, including three sixes and 12 fours, against somewhat more demanding opposition in the match against Derbyshire. The innings, said Wisden, \"revealed he could be relied upon when quick scoring was needed\".\n\nThe following two seasons, 1960 and 1961, saw Greetham make useful innings and take useful wickets, but he did not advance on his 1959 figures, making around 800 runs in each season and failing to score a century in either. In 1962, however, he made 1,000 runs for the first time in a season, finishing with 1151 at an average of 26.76 runs per innings, and taking 69 first-class wickets at an average of 20.91. There were no centuries in this season, but his seven for 56 against Glamorgan were the best innings bowling figures of his career, and when he took six for 19 and four for 29 against Lancashire late in the season he achieved 10 wickets in a match for the only time in his first-class career. Wisden was complimentary about Greetham's progress in 1962: \"Greetham, previously a useful middle order batsman, developed into an extremely competent all-rounder,\" it wrote. \"A naturally aggressive right-hander, he scored over 1,000 runs for the first time and, bowling at a lively pace, took more wickets during the season than in his previous four years with the county.\" Greetham was awarded his county cap in 1962.\n\nThe 1963 season saw Somerset finish third in the County Championship, equalling the highest placing in its history to that point. Greetham was one of six players to pass 1,000 runs for the season, and his final aggregate of 1186 was his best for a single season, with the average of 28.23 runs per innings the highest of his career. Against Leicestershire at Weston-super-Mare, on a wet pitch, he made 141 in three hours; eight Somerset wickets had fallen for 145 when Greetham was joined by Harold Stephenson, the Somerset captain, and the pair put on 183 for the ninth wicket in 105 minutes. The stand remains the ninth wicket record for Somerset: it was equalled, but not surpassed, in 1990 by Chris Tavare and Neil Mallender. With the recruitment of fast bowler Fred Rumsey to Somerset in 1963, there was less bowling for Greetham, but he still took 44 wickets.\n\nGreetham was one of several Somerset batsmen for whom the 1964 season saw a regression. Unlike Peter Wight and Brian Roe, who suffered similar declines, he retained his place for most matches, but his aggregate of runs dropped by more than half to just 504, there was only one score of more than 50, and his average fell too to just 15. His bowling offered no consolation, and his wickets fell to just 17 and the average rose to more than 40 runs per wicket.\n\nThere was a small improvement in batting in 1965, when he made 943 runs in all matches at an average of 21.93. The total included centuries in both the home and away matches against Middlesex. Wisden commented in its reports on both matches about the speed of Greetham's scoring and the power of his strokes, and later in the season noted \"a remarkable innings\" against Cambridge University in which Greetham, arriving at the wicket with 45 minutes of the first day to play, reached 73 not out by close of play (he went on to 93). But Greetham's bowling had disappeared almost entirely by this stage: in 28 County Championship matches in 1965, he bowled only six overs and took no wickets, and his only two wickets of the whole season came in the match against Cambridge University.\n\nThe 1966 season was, like 1963, a successful one for Somerset, but this time Greetham played almost no part. Dropped after two matches in which he made only 26 runs, he did not regain his place except for one match against Cambridge University, in which he again took two wickets, but again failed with the bat. This was his last first-class match.\n\nGreetham \"would have been made for one-day cricket\", says one modern directory of Somerset cricketers. In fact, his record in the 10 Gillette Cup matches he played for Somerset between 1963 and 1966 was modest, with 150 runs in 10 innings and just three wickets. He did, however, retain his place in Somerset's one-day side longer than in the first-class team: his last first-team appearance was in the Gillette semi-final defeat by Warwickshire in August 1966.\n\nThis was not, however, his final List A appearance. Having left Somerset at the end of the 1966 season, he appeared in Minor Counties cricket for Devon in 1968 and 1969, and in the latter season he played in the first round Gillette Cup match against Hertfordshire, not bowling but scoring 32 out of a Devon total of 75 as Hertfordshire won the match easily.\n\nAfter cricket\nGreetham played three non-first-class matches for Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and Free Foresters in 1970 and 1971 with some success. Outside cricket, he worked as \"a diamond sorter, teacher and film extra\". He was also secretary of a golf club in Devon.\n\nReferences\n\n1936 births\n2017 deaths\nEnglish cricketers\nSomerset cricketers\nDevon cricketers", "machine_text": "Chris Greetham is a British astrophysicist at the University of Southampton. He is known for his research on supernovae and gravitational waves. Early life and education Greetham was born on June 1, 1985, in Manchester, England. He received his bachelor's degree in physics from the University of Manchester in 2008. He then went on to earn a Ph.D. in astrophysics from the University of Cambridge in 2012. Career Following his Ph.D., Greetham was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, before joining the faculty at the University of Southampton in 2015. One of Greetham's major contributions to the field of astrophysics has been his work on supernovae. He has used observations of the light emitted by supernovae to study their properties and determine their distances from Earth. This research has helped to improve our understanding of the expansion of the universe and the properties of dark energy. Greetham has also been involved in the search for gravitational waves. In 2017, he was part of a team of researchers that detected a gravitational wave signal from a merging pair of neutron stars. This marked the first time that both gravitational waves and light emissions had been detected from the same astronomical event. In addition to his research, Greetham is also involved in science outreach efforts. He has given talks at schools and public events in the United Kingdom and the United States, with the goal of promoting science education and public engagement with science. Personal life Greetham is married and has two children. In his free time, he enjoys hiking and playing the guitar.

He was born on September 28, 1887, in a small town called Talsi located in the western region of Latvia and died on April 22, 1925. Meierovics studied law at the University of St. Petersburg, Russia. After he completed his education, he returned to Latvia and became an active participant in the country's political scene. In 1915, during World War I, he played a leading role in the Latvian Riflemen's Battalions (Latvie\u0161u str\u0113lnieki), which played a crucial role in repelling the German drive towards Petrograd. After Latvia declared independence on November 18, 1918, he was appointed as the Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Provisional Government of Latvia. He served in this role until 1921 and then went on to become the Prime Minister of Latvia from 1921 to 1924. Meierovics was a pragmatic politician who understood the importance of foreign alliances and trade ties for Latvia. Under his leadership, Latvia established friendly relations with several countries, including Great Britain and the United States. He also made significant efforts to strengthen the Latvian economy through trade agreements. Meierovics' leadership was vital during a period of great instability both in Latvia and internationally. His government managed to stabilize Latvia's political situation, allowing it to focus on the rebuilding of the country's infrastructure and security. Meierovics, however, faced many challenges during his tenure as Prime Minister. The country was plagued by economic problems, with high inflation rates and unemployment. Ethnic tensions were also high, with many Russians and Germans living in Latvia. He also faced criticism from opposition parties for his pro-Western policies and his handling of a growing corruption scandal involving members of his government. Meierovics passed away in 1925, and his untimely death was a significant loss for Latvia. Despite only serving as Prime Minister for three years, he remains an important figure in Latvian history, known for his role in Latvia's independence and his efforts to establish strong relationships with other countries. His legacy continues to inspire Latvians to this day and is a symbol of national pride and determination.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 69216793}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"William Smith (loyalist)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "William \"Plum\" Smith (sometimes erroneously spelt Smyth) (26 January 1954 \u2013 8 June 2016) was a Northern Irish loyalist, former paramilitary, and politician. He had been involved in Ulster loyalism in various capacities for at least forty years.\n\nEarly life\nSmith was born in Mountjoy Street on Belfast's Shankill Road into a poor Ulster Protestant family, the son of shipyard worker Charles William Smith and his wife Isobel. He had three older sisters, Margaret, Elizabeth and Nan (the latter dying in infancy before he was born), a younger brother Gordon and a younger sister Jean. There was rumoured Native American ancestry in his family; therefore in his youth he acquired the lifelong nickname \"Plum\" after The Beano character Little Plum. He was raised in a working class home where his parents sent him to Sunday school and taught him to respect the law. Like many of his contemporaries from similar backgrounds on both sides of the divide, the outbreak of the socio-political\\religious conflict that came to be known as the Troubles in 1969 saw him become involved in paramilitarism.\n\nMove to paramilitarism\nFollowing the introduction of internment in 1971, Smith worked for a time as an orderly in Crumlin Road Gaol where he served six months for rioting against the British Army in the Highfield estate. Unbeknownst to the prison authorities, Smith was working as a mole for the imprisoned Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) leader Gusty Spence, passing on information about the conditions in which the internees were being held.\n\nAround this time Smith was a member of the vigilante group and was part of a group within the SDA that later became the Red Hand Commando, including founder John McKeague, who decided to form a new, more active organisation. In 1972, Smith was a founder-member of this new group, which quickly became an elite squad augmenting the UVF.\n\nOn 1 July Smith was one of two armed RHC men to meet Spence when he was released from prison to attend the wedding of his daughter to Winkie Rea. He took Spence to a meeting of the UVF leadership where a plan was hatched to keep Spence out of prison. A few days later when Spence was being returned to jail by his nephew Frankie Curry, their car was stopped on Belfast's Springmartin Road and Spence \"kidnapped\" by UVF/RHC operatives.\n\nSoon after this incident Smith was himself arrested for his part in the attempted murder of Catholic civilian Joseph Hall, a drive-by shooting that Smith would later admit was motivated by \"pure sectarianism and bigotry\". Smith was handed a ten-year prison sentence for the shooting. Tried along with Ronnie McCullough and Tom Reid, Smith pleaded not guilty although he subsequently admitted that he did so to satisfy the UVF's policy of members never pleading guilty and would state that \"we were caught red-handed\".\n\nIn the Maze\nAlong with the likes of Billy Hutchinson, David Ervine and Billy Mitchell, Smith was one of those on the UVF wings of the Maze prison in the 1970s to be won over by Gusty Spence to his newer, more politicised, way of thinking. This cadre of Spence-trained political figures would go on to play a leading role in bringing about the UVF ceasefire in 1994 as members of the Progressive Unionist Party (PUP). He learnt Irish during his time in prison, and was happy to refer to the language as 'his own'. Smith was released on 28 July 1977 after serving five years of a ten-year sentence.\n\nPolitical activity\n\nSmith secured a job in the Harland & Wolff shipyard in 1978 and became involved in trade union activity, initially as a shop steward before ultimately ending up a member of the general executive of the Transport & General Workers Union. He was dismissed from the shipyard in 1988 following a period of restructuring that involved a sell-off of part of the business, although Smith contended that his trade union activity had hastened his removal by making him unpopular with the management.\n\nAt this point the unemployed Smith became involved with a number of community schemes on the Shankill Road that were organised by Gusty Spence, initially in a voluntary capacity. The two became close and when Spence undertook a reorganisation of the PUP in 1990, Smith was given the role of chairman and Prisons Spokesman, along with Hugh Smyth as leader, David Ervine as Political Spokesman and Spence and Jim McDonald as members of the party executive.\n\nThrough Spence, Smith established contacts with Joe Colgan, a Dublin-based Irish republican, and in March 1993 the two arranged an event in the city at which both a member of the UVF and the trade unionist Chris Hudson were in attendance. As a result of the meeting Hudson opened a regular channel of contact with the UVF through which he exhorted them to seek peace.\n\nThe Combined Loyalist Military Command (CLMC) ceasefire was announced on 13 October 1994 at Fernhill House, Glencairn when Gusty Spence read out a joint statement of ceasefire flanked by Smith and Jim McDonald of the PUP and Ulster Democratic Party representatives Gary McMichael, Davy Adams and John White. Smith was the chairman of the press conference at which Spence read out the statement. For a time he had served as Chairman of the Progressive Unionist Party itself.\n\nSmith would go on to devote his attentions to community work with the Ex-Prisoners Interpretative Centre although he has remained a spokesman for the PUP. He was also an unsuccessful candidate for the PUP in the Belfast City Council elections in 2001 in the Court district electoral area.\n\nSpeaking out in 2012 about Unionist concerns at the Maze prison becoming an IRA shrine with a proposed Conflict Transformation Centre, Smith stated that if Loyalists themselves got involved in the scheme they could tell their side of the story and no one particular group could use it as a shrine.\n\nOpposition to trials\nIn 2009 Smith was strongly critical of the report issued by the Consultative Group on the Past, as chaired by Robin Eames and Denis Bradley. He criticised the work of the Historical Enquiries Team, which investigated unsolved incidents from the Troubles, arguing that it was opening \"a can of worms\" and preventing \"closure\". He compared any attempts to reopen investigations and bring about criminal proceedings to the Nuremberg trials.\n\nIn 2010 Smith attacked the work of Victims Commissioner Brendan McAllister, who was investigating the activities of the UVF unit based on the Mount Vernon estate, north Belfast, during the Troubles. Smith argued that such investigations contravened a guarantee he had been given by Mo Mowlam that offences committed before 1998 could not be prosecuted due to a general amnesty. Soon afterwards Smith claimed that a document released by the British and Irish governments proved that the deal was in place as he claimed. In support of his stance Smith even gave evidence at the trial of Gerry McGeough, arguing that the republican should not have been tried for the 1981 attempted murder of Sammy Brush because of the supposed deal being in place.\n\nBook\nSmith launched his book Inside Man, Loyalists of Long Kesh \u2013 The Untold Story () on 13 October 2014, the twentieth anniversary of the CLMC ceasefire. The book argues that thanks to politicisation and education a group of prominent loyalists prisoners came to support negotiation with their republican counterparts, leading to the eventual Northern Ireland peace process. The book mainly dealt with the experiences of loyalist prisoners within the Maze and was not intended as an autobiography.\n\nDeath\nSmith died on 8 June 2016, aged 62 after a short illness. Former PUP leader Brian Ervine paid tribute to his negotiating skills by bringing the RHC & UVF to the peace process, his intelligence, left thinking politics and for his cross community work. Sinn F\u00e9in Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness praised his contribution and commitment to the peace process.\n\nHis funeral was held in St. Matthew's Church of Ireland on the Woodvale Road. Community worker and former loyalist prisoner Jim Wilson described Smith's contribution to loyalism as 'massive' during The Troubles but later became an 'architect of peace'. Wilson also commented that Sinn F\u00e9in representative's presence at the funeral proved Smith's sincerity at extending the hand of friendship across the sectarian divide.\n\nReferences\n\n1954 births\n2016 deaths\nUlster Volunteer Force members\nProgressive Unionist Party politicians\nPoliticians from Belfast\nRed Hand Commando members\nTrade unionists from Belfast", "machine_text": "William Smith (loyalist) was a prominent political figure in 18th century North America, known for his support of British colonial rule and opposition to the American Revolution. Born in New York in 1727, Smith became a successful lawyer and politician, serving as a member of the New York Assembly and later as the state's chief justice. However, his political views put him at odds with many of his fellow colonists. Smith strongly believed in the importance of maintaining British authority in the colonies, and opposed the idea of American independence. He argued that the colonists were better off under British rule, and that a break with the mother country would lead to chaos and instability. Smith was also a vocal critic of the radical elements within the Patriot movement, accusing them of promoting violence and anarchy. During the Revolutionary War, Smith became one of the most prominent Loyalists in New York. He worked closely with British officials, providing them with intelligence and helping to coordinate loyalist activities. In 1776, he was accused of treason by the Continental Congress and was forced to flee to England, where he spent the rest of his life. Despite his controversial views, Smith was highly respected within loyalist circles. He was known for his eloquence and his staunch defense of the British constitution. In his writings and speeches, he argued that the American Revolution was a threat to the rule of law and the principles of good government. His legacy as a defender of British colonialism continues to be debated by historians and political theorists. In conclusion, William Smith (loyalist) was a prominent political figure in 18th century North America who opposed the American Revolution and was a strong supporter of British colonial rule. Although his views were controversial and ultimately led to his exile, his staunch defense of the British constitution continues to be studied and debated by scholars today.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 31937336}

About 60% of the district's territory is covered by forests, mostly pine. Swamps occupy another 3.6%.\n\nHistory\n\nOriginally, the area of the district was populated by Finnic peoples, and historically was changing hands between Sweden and Russia; in particular, at some point it belonged to the Novgorod Republic, and from the 15th century, it was annexed together with all Novgorod Lands by the Grand Duchy of Moscow; it belonged to the Vodskaya pyatina, one of the five pyatinas of Novgorod Lands. In 1617, according to the Treaty of Stolbovo, the west of the area was transferred to Sweden, and in 1721, according to the Treaty of Nystad, it was transferred back by Russia.\n\nIn the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, the area was included into Ingermanland Governorate (known since 1710 as Saint Petersburg Governorate). In 1727, it became a part of Saint Petersburgsky Uyezd, and in 1755, Shlisselburgsky Uyezd was established, and the current area of the district became split between the two uyezds.

He went to Ireland as page to the Duke of Devonshire, and had a successful career in the viceregal household. On 1 June 1739 he joined the Army with a commission as second lieutenant in Bissett's Regiment of Foot, and after a progressive service in the subordinate commissions, he was appointed lieutenant-colonel of the 10th Regiment in 1755, and was afterwards employed many years on the staff of Ireland, as quartermaster-general in that country. \n\nIn 1762 Gisborne was promoted to the rank of colonel of Foot, with command of the 121st Regiment, and on 4 March 1766 he was removed to the 16th Regiment. In 1770 Gisborne was persuaded by Lord Townshend to resign his post as quartermaster-general in favour of Simon Fraser, and was compensated with the sinecure of Governor of Kinsale. However, the government of Kinsale was then required for the outgoing adjutant-general, Robert Cuninghame, and Gisborne was granted a pension of \u00a3500 per annum until another government of greater value should become vacant; he was later appointed Governor of Charlemont. Gisborne was promoted to major-general in 1770, and to lieutenant-general in 1777. \n\nBesides his military career, Gisborne was Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod from September 1757, and sat in the Irish House of Commons for Tallow from 1763 to 1768, and for Lismore from 1768 until his death on 20 February 1778.\n\nReferences\n\n1720s births\n1778 deaths\nIrish MPs 1761\u20131768\nIrish MPs 1769\u20131776\nIrish MPs 1776\u20131783\nBritish Army generals\nRoyal Lincolnshire Regiment officers\nBedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiment officers\n30th Regiment of Foot officers\nMembers of the Parliament of Ireland (pre-1801) for County Waterford constituencies\nPoliticians from County Waterford", "machine_text": "James Gisborne (July 15, 1790 \u2013 October 26, 1866) was a British politician and philanthropist who served as the Member of Parliament for Nottingham from 1832 to 1847. Born in Burlington, Gloucestershire, Gisborne was the son of a wealthy merchant and landowner. He attended Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he showed a keen interest in politics. He was called to the bar in 1815, but never practiced law, choosing instead to focus on his various charitable activities. In the early 1820s, Gisborne became involved in the movement to improve factory conditions and promote child welfare, particularly in the textile mills of Lancashire. He was a passionate advocate of free trade and worked tirelessly to promote it, writing numerous articles and pamphlets on the subject. His efforts to reform factory legislation earned him the nickname \"the father of factory reform.\" In 1832, Gisborne was elected to Parliament as a Whig, representing Nottingham. He was a vocal supporter of the Great Reform Bill of 1832, which expanded the voting rights of the middle classes. He also supported the abolition of slavery and the repeal of the Corn Laws, which restricted the importation of grain. He was re-elected in 1835 and 1841. Gisborne remained active in philanthropic and political circles throughout his life, supporting various causes and serving on numerous charitable boards. He was a prominent member of the British and Foreign Bible Society and the Society for the Suppression of Vice. He died in London in 1866, aged 76. Gisborne was remembered as a dedicated and compassionate advocate for social justice and reform. His contributions to the cause of factory reform and the promotion of free trade helped shape British society and paved the way for future generations of reformers and activists.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 53193568}

South Africa has a rich history with a multicultural and diverse background. The Scottish influence on the country can be traced back to the 1800s, when Scottish immigrants settled in South Africa. Due to their significant contribution to the country's history, many places have been named after Scottish individuals and landmarks. One such location is Dundee, a town situated in KwaZulu-Natal province. The town was founded in 1882 by a Scottish immigrant, Peter Smith. Smith named the town after his hometown in Scotland, which is also called Dundee. Dundee is well known for its coal mines and textile industry. It played a significant role during the Anglo-Boer War, where the Battle of Talana Hill was fought in its vicinity. Another Scottish name location in South Africa is the town of Aberdeen. The town is located in the Eastern Cape province and was named after the Scottish city of Aberdeen. The town was founded in 1856 by Scottish settlers, who established a sheep farming industry. A third location is Grahamstown, a city in the Eastern Cape province. The city was founded in 1812 and named after Sir John Graham, a Scottish soldier and administrator who was instrumental in the colonization of the Eastern Cape. Grahamstown is a cultural hub and hosts the annual National Arts Festival, which showcases South Africa's diverse talent in the arts.

Over It. is the indie rock solo project of the Chicago, Illinois-based musician Evan Thomas Weiss. It is considered one of the leading acts in the emo revival scene of the 2010s.\n\nHistory\nEvan Weiss grew up in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. His first exposure to emo was hearing the band Sunny Day Real Estate in the seventh grade while browsing a record shop. He continued his interest in music through buying Jade Tree and Polyvinyl records and going to local shows in Philadelphia. In the \"fourth or fifth grade\", Weiss started, with school friends, the band J.A.R., which eventually became The Progress, garnering modest local success. The Progress released an album and two EPs before breaking up in 2008. The Progress later reunited sporadically to perform one-off live shows. He was unable to convince his bandmates to play in the band full-time. \n\nHe started a solo project under the moniker Into It. Over It.. He first released music through two unorthodox concept projects: 52 Weeks, entailing the writing, recording and release of one song each week for a year (later released as a compilation); and Twelve Towns, a 12-song project initially released over six separate splits with several different bands, in which each song was named after a town. In May 2011, the band made an appearance at Bled Fest. \n\nIn June, Weiss released Into It. Over It.'s first studio album, Proper on No Sleep Records, produced by Ed Rose. In the last two months of the year, Into It. Over It. supported The Swellers on their European tour. In March and April the next year, Into It. Over It. supported The Wonder Years on the Glamour Kills Spring 2012 tour in the US. To promote the tour, a compilation showcasing the bands covering each others' songs with released. Into It. Over It.'s contribution was a cover of The Wonder Years's track \"Don't Let Me Cave In\". This was followed up in 2013 with Intersections, released on Triple Crown Records and on Big Scary Monsters in UK/Europe.\n\nIn January 2015, on a break from touring, Weiss and touring drummer Josh Sparks lived for a month in a secluded cabin in Craftsbury, Vermont, where they wrote the third Into It. Over It. album. Built for the specific purpose of allowing musicians to work in isolation, Weiss said of the location: \"We were an hour from the nearest gas station, an hour from the nearest grocery store. Totally isolated, 4ft of snow on the ground, negative 20 degrees outside. The whole thing was run on solar or generator power, so no phone, no internet.\" He and Sparks spent 13 hours a day writing music. After completing a solo tour alongside Kevin Devine and Laura Stevenson, a stint in the UK with Modern Baseball and several spring support dates for Minus the Bear, Weiss officially wrapped up touring for the Intersections album\u2014which by that time had consisted of \"well over 250 shows in a little over 15 countries\" since 2013\u2014to begin recording Into It .Over It.'s third studio album with John Vanderslice. Weiss and Sparks entered Vanderslice's Tiny Telephone Studio in June to record; Weiss recalled: \"We couldn't sweat the small stuff, you're not able to go in and tweak or micromanage little sections of the music. It helped me accept chaos in a way I couldn't before.\" Into It. Over It. continued to play shows into the end of 2015 after Weiss completed a tour with his side project Pet Symmetry in support of Dan Andriano in the Emergency Room and Jeff Rosenstock. Notable dates included Riot Fest Chicago, Weiss's solo set at The Fest, a tour in support of The Get Up Kids in December (with Weiss and Into It. Over It. touring member Rodrigo Palma playing bass for The Get Up Kids at one show), and The Promise Ring's New Year's Eve reunion show.\n\nInto It. Over It. first revealed the upcoming release of their third album Standards through an article on SPIN, a teaser on their Facebook page, and an interview with Noisey which was accompanied by a stream of the first song from the album, \"No EQ\". Standards was released on March 11, 2016, through Triple Crown Records, and the band toured the US in support of the album alongside The World Is a Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid to Die from March to May.\n\nRelated acts\nWeiss was a notably active figure in underground punk and emo music as far back as 2001, and played in numerous bands from Chicago as well as around his hometown of Cherry Hill, New Jersey. He currently fronts Pet Symmetry with Erik Czaja and Marcus Nuccio of fellow emo band Dowsing, and also fronted Their / They're / There alongside Mike Kinsella of Owen and Matthew Frank of Loose Lips Sink Ships,. He plays bass in both bands despite having gained notoriety as a guitarist in Into. It Over It. Bass was the first instrument he learned and hence what he usually played.\n\nThe initial members of Into It. Over It.'s live band also formed a separate project named Stay Ahead of the Weather They released an EP in 2010 as well as a split with The Wonder Years No updates regarding the activities of the band came after May 2013. Weiss stated about the possibility of another album, \"probably not unfortunately. everyone is doing their own thing now[sic]\".\n\nHe was also previously a member of Damiera, and Up Up Down Down Left Right Left Right B A Start, as well as a large number of much smaller bands from his high school years including Labour, Map the Growth, The Funeral Bird, Hiroshima Mon'Amour, Sleeper Agents, The French Connection, Emergency, and Forgive Her Choke Her.\n\nIn mid-2015, Into.

It was discovered on 9 September 1953, by astronomers during the Indiana Asteroid Program at Goethe Link Observatory in Brooklyn, Indiana, United States. The asteroid was named after American mathematician Morton Lowengrub, dean at Indiana University and one of the fathers of the WIYN Observatory.\n\nOrbit and classification \n\nLowengrub is a member of the Alauda family (), a large family of carbonaceous asteroids and named after its parent body, 702\u00a0Alauda.\n\nIt orbits the Sun in the outermost main-belt at a distance of 2.9\u20133.6\u00a0AU once every 5 years and 10 months (2,121 days; semi-major axis of 3.23\u00a0AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.10 and an inclination of 21\u00b0 with respect to the ecliptic.\n\nThe body's observation arc begins with its first identification as  at Uccle Observatory in November 1948, almost five years prior to its official discovery observation at Goethe.\n\nPhysical characteristics \n\nLowengrub is an assumed C-type asteroid.\n\nRotation period \n\nA rotational lightcurve of Lowengrub was reported in 1996 and obtained from \nphotometric observations by group of French astronomers in the early 1990s. Lightcurve analysis gave a well-defined rotation period of 9.764 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.40 magnitude ().\n\nDiameter and albedo \n\nAccording to the surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Lowengrub measures between 29.61 and 37.07 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.051 and 0.062.\n\nThe Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for carbonaceous asteroids of 0.057 and derives a diameter of 32.78 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 11.17.\n\nNaming \n\nThis minor planet was named after American mathematician Morton Lowengrub, dean, professor and administrator at Indiana University. The naming took place on the occasion of the completion of the WIYN Observatory with its 3.5-meter telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona. Lowengrub was instrumental for the planning and construction of the WIYN and was a charter member of the WIYN Board of Governors \n\nLowengrub has authored several books on mathematics including \"Crack problems in the classical theory of elasticity\" (1969) together with Scottish mathematician Ian Sneddon.

The asteroid has an eccentric orbit, which means that it follows an elliptical path, bringing it closer and farther away from the Sun at different times. Several observations of 4045 Lowengrub have been carried out by astronomers. In 2007, stellar occultation observations suggested that the asteroid has an elongated shape, with a long axis of about 16 km and a short axis of about 10 km. This was confirmed by observations carried out at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory in the Canary Islands in 2008. The origin and composition of 4045 Lowengrub are still unknown, but it is believed to be a primitive asteroid, meaning it has remained mostly unchanged since its formation. This makes it an interesting target for future space missions, as it could provide valuable insight into the early Solar System. Overall, 4045 Lowengrub is a fascinating object in our Solar System, and one that continues to be studied by astronomers. Its discovery and subsequent observations have helped us deepen our understanding of the universe around us.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 16467007}

Born in Hastings, Nebraska, he was an outfielder and first baseman who appeared in 1,393 Major League Baseball games over 14 seasons (1939\u201352) for the St. Louis Cardinals, Boston Braves, Pittsburgh Pirates, Brooklyn Dodgers, New York Yankees and Detroit Tigers. He threw and batted left-handed, and was listed as  tall and . He was nicknamed \"Cotney\" as a youth because of his blond (\"cotton-top\") hair.\n\nAs a Cardinal and Yankee, Hopp appeared in five World Series between  and  and was a member of the winning team in four of them.\n\nPlaying and coaching career\nHopp graduated from Hastings High School, attended Hastings College and was signed by the Cardinals in 1936. He apprenticed in their extensive farm system for four seasons, hitting over .300 three times.\n\nCardinals\nHopp made his Cardinal debut on September 18, 1939, and entered the big leagues for good the following season. During his first season as a regular, , Hopp started 75 games in the outfield and another 33 as backup first baseman to slugger Johnny Mize. He batted .303 with 135 hits, including 25 doubles and 11 triples, third in the National League. He also stole 15 bases, fifth-most in the league. Both  and  saw Hopp slump at the plate, but contribute to back-to-back Cardinal pennants. In the 1942 World Series, Hopp started all five games at first base, and although he collected only three singles in 17 at bats to the cause, St. Louis won the world championship over the New York Yankees, four games to one.\n\nThen, in , he had his best overall season. Playing as the Cardinals' everyday center fielder (in the absence of Terry Moore, who was performing World War II military service), Hopp reached career highs in hits (177), runs scored (106), doubles (35), home runs (11) and runs batted in (72); his batting average (.336) was his second-best. The Redbirds won their third consecutive National League championship. In the all-St. Louis 1944 World Series, he again started all six games and played errorless ball as the Cardinals won their second world title in three seasons, overcoming the Browns. Hopp had a relatively quiet Series at the plate, collecting five singles in 17 at bats.\n\nBraves\nThe last wartime season, , saw Hopp become the Cardinals' regular right fielder, and his batting average fell to .289 as St. Louis finished second, three games behind the Chicago Cubs. That off-season, Cardinal manager Billy Southworth moved to the Boston Braves, and with the surplus of major-league talent coming back from wartime service, Boston began purchasing players who had contributed to Southworth's successful Cardinal teams of 1940\u201345. They obtained Hopp for shortstop Eddie Joost and cash on February 5, 1946. The trade led to Hopp's second-most-productive campaign. Splitting time between first base and center field, he collected 148 hits and batted .333, and stole a career-high 21 bases. Selected to the 1946 National League All-Star team, Hopp started in center field at Fenway Park on July 9 and singled against Bob Feller in two at bats. It would be his only career All-Star appearance.\n\nPirates\nHopp returned to the Braves in , but was platooned in center field with right-handed-hitting Mike McCormick and his average fell to .288. That November, he was swapped to the Pirates for their center fielder, Jim Russell, in a five-player deal. Hopp would be the Pirates' regular center fielder in  and , with the exception of a three-week period in the latter season. On May 18 of that year, he was traded to the Dodgers for outfielder Marv Rackley. He appeared in eight games for Brooklyn, including two starting assignments, but went 0-for-14 at the plate, dropping his average to .174 on the season. Then, on June 7, the trade was canceled and Rackley and Hopp returned to their original clubs. Hopp responded by batting .335 with 106 hits through the rest of the season for the Pirates (raising his final average to .306). His hot streak continued in  when, as the Bucs' starting first baseman, Hopp added another 108 safeties. He was hitting .340 on September 5 when last-place Pittsburgh sent him to the Yankees in a waiver deal.\n\nYankees\nThe Yankees were then embroiled in a pennant scramble with the Detroit Tigers, and Hopp's game-winning pinch hit grand slam against the Browns on September 17 contributed to the Yankees' surge to the American League championship. He went 9-for-27 (.333) as a Yankee during that stretch drive. Allowed to participate in the World Series despite his post-August-31 acquisition, Hopp got into three games and was hitless in two at bats. He hung on in the American League as a part-time player for the next two seasons. In , Hopp was a pinch hitter and the Yankees' third-string first baseman (behind Joe Collins and Mize) and made his final World Series appearance, drawing a walk in his only plate appearance in Game 3.\n\nThe Yankees released Hopp in late May 1952 and he caught on days later with the Tigers, who had fallen all the way from pennant contention in 1950 to last place in . Appearing mostly as a pinch hitter, Hopp batted only .217 for the Tigers and retired as an active player.\n\nCareer summary\nIn his 14 MLB seasons, Hopp collected 1,262 hits, with 216 doubles, 74 triples, 46 home runs and 458 runs batted in. He hit .296 lifetime and stole 128 bases. Defensively, Hopp posted a .986 fielding percentage playing first base and all three outfield positions.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Fungal genome\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Fungal genomes are among the smallest genomes of eukaryotes. The sizes of fungal genomes range from less than 10 Mbp to hundreds of Mbp. The average genome size is approximately 37 Mbp in Ascomycota, 47 Mbp in Basidiomycota and 75 Mbp in Oomycota. The sizes and gene numbers of the smallest genomes of free-living fungi such as those of Wallemia ichthyophaga, Wallemia mellicola or Malassezia restricta are comparable to bacterial genomes. The genome of the extensively researched yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains approximately 12 Mbp and was the first completely sequenced eukaryotic genome. Due to their compact size fungal genomes can be sequenced with less resources than most other eukaryotic genomes and are thus important models for research. Some fungi exist as stable haploid, diploid, or polyploid cells, others change ploidy in response to environmental conditions and aneuploidy is also observed in novel environments or during periods of stress.\n\nGenome comparisons \nThe comparison of fungal genomes has been used to study the evolution of fungi, to improve the resolution of the phylogeny of fungal species, and to determine the time of the emergence and changes in species traits and lifestyles, such as the evolution symbiotic or pathogenic interactions, and the evolution of different morphologies. Major chromosomal rearrangements in fungi were found to be more frequent than in other eukaryotes, thus macrosynteny in fungi is rare. However, in filamentous ascomycetes genes were found to be conserved within homologous chromosomes, but with randomized orders and orientations, a phenomenon named mesosynteny. Mesosynteny was also observed in the basidiomycetous genus Rhodotorula. A comparison of more than 1000 Saccharomyces cerevisiae genomes was used to identify the geographical origin and several domestication events of the species as well as map genomic variants to the species-wide phenotypic landscape of the yeast. Comparisons of several genomes of the same species led to discovery of high levels of recombination in species that were previously considered asexual. In the extremely halotolerant black yeast Hortaea werneckii it was discovered that while the species is clonal, both haploid and diploid strains can be found in nature and the diploid strains are highly heterozygous hybrids, which appear to be stable over large time scales and geographical distances.\n\nUse in taxonomy \n\nWhile genomic distance measures such as the average nucleotide identity (ANI) are used routinely to distinguish bacterial species, the use of fungal genomes in taxonomy is currently rare. Genome sequences can be used to expand the number of genes used in phylogenetic analyses, but many publicly available genomes lack gene annotations and popular rDNA markers are typically missing from genomic sequences or are incorrectly assembled. Suggested measures of overall genome related indices in yeast include ANI, digital DNA-DNA hybridisation (dDDH) and Kr distance. Genomic collinearity was suggested as a possible source of markers to resolve species complexes. Pairwise Kr genomic distances and average nucleotide identity were used in the description of new species within the genera Aureobasidium and Tilletia. Alternatively, quick and simple to calculate similarity measures based on MinHash also appear to produce usefully accurate estimates of distance between genomes. For example, a fixed threshold genomic distance calculated tools such as Mash and Dashing was able to determine whether two genomes belong to the same or to different species with over 90% accuracy, indicating that simple measures of genomic distance might be useful to delineate fungal species and still largely support the existing fungal taxonomy.\n\nReferences\n\nFungi\nGenomics", "machine_text": "Fungal genome refers to the complete set of DNA sequences present in the genome of fungi. The fungal genome is similar to that of other eukaryotic organisms but has several unique features, including high levels of gene duplication, genomic plasticity, and accelerated rates of evolution. Genome sequencing of fungi has become increasingly common in recent years, and a large number of fungal genomes have been sequenced and annotated. These genome sequences provide valuable insights into the genetic basis of fungal biology, including gene regulation, pathogenesis, and adaptation to different environments. One of the most unique features of the fungal genome is the presence of repetitive elements, which constitute a significant proportion of the genome. These repetitive elements often play a role in the evolution of new genes and functions by providing a substrate for homologous recombination and gene duplication. Another important feature of the fungal genome is the presence of secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters, which are responsible for the production of a diverse array of bioactive compounds. These compounds are of significant interest for their medicinal properties, and the identification and characterization of these gene clusters has become a major focus of fungal genomics research. Fungal genomics has also provided important insights into the evolution of fungal pathogens, including the mechanisms that allow fungi to evade host immune responses and the development of drug resistance. Additionally, comparative genomics studies have revealed the evolutionary relationships between different fungal species and shed light on the mechanisms of speciation and adaptation in these organisms. Despite the significant progress that has been made in fungal genomics in recent years, many aspects of fungal biology and genetics remain poorly understood. However, continued advances in sequencing technologies and bioinformatics tools are likely to lead to further breakthroughs in our understanding of the fungal genome and its role in fungal biology and evolution.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 65758285}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Tribe of Dan\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Tribe of Dan (), meaning, \"Judge\", was one of the tribes of Israel, according to the Torah. They were allocated a coastal portion of land when the people of Israel entered the Promised Land, later moving northwards.\n\nBiblical narrative\n\nIn the Biblical census of the Book of Numbers, the tribe of Dan is portrayed as the second largest Israelite tribe (after Judah). Some textual scholars regard the census as being from the Priestly Source, dating it to around the 7th century BC, and more likely to reflect the biases of its authors. In the Blessing of Moses, which some textual scholars regard as dating from only slightly earlier than the deuteronomist, Dan is prophesied to \"leap from Bashan\"; scholars are uncertain why this should be since the tribe did not live in the Bashan plain, east of the Jordan River.\n\nConquest and territory\nAccording to the biblical narrative, following the completion of the conquest of Canaan by the Israelite tribes after about 1200 BCE, Joshua allocated the land among the twelve tribes. Dan was the last tribe to receive its territorial inheritance. The land originally allocated to Dan was a small enclave in the central coastal area of Canaan, between Judah, Benjamin, Ephraim and the Philistines.\n\nTo the north the territory of Dan abutted Joppa, the modern Jaffa. This territory, not very extensive originally, was soon diminished by its dangerous neighbors, the Philistines. The tribe was only able to camp in the hill country overlooking the Sorek Valley, the camp location becoming known as Mahaneh Dan (\"Camp of Dan\"). () The region they were trying to settle extended south into the Shephelah in the area of Timnah; as a result, the modern state of Israel refers to the region as Gush Dan (the Dan area).\n\nFrom after the conquest of the land by Joshua until the formation of the first united Kingdom of Israel in c. 1050 BC, the Tribe of Dan was a part of a loose confederation of Israelite tribes. No central government existed, and in times of crisis the people were led by ad hoc leaders known as Judges.\n\nThe most celebrated Danite was Samson, a Danite judge from the period of settlement in the lands allotted by Joshua. Pnina Galpaz-Feller sees similarities between the story of Samson and Denyen tribal legends. Excavations conducted at Tel Dan by Dr. David Ilan of the Hebrew Union College, show support for the Danites' potential Aegean connections.\n\nAs a consequence of the pressure from the Philistines, a portion of the tribe abandoned hopes of settling near the central coast, instead migrating to the north of Philistine territory, and after conquering Laish, refounded it as the city of Dan (). Thus their territory in the end lay northeast of that of Naphtali, east of the upper Jordan River, near its eastern sources, and defining the northern extent of the land of the Israelites. A number of biblical texts thus refer to \"All Israel, from Dan to Beersheba\".\n\nUnited Monarchy\nWith the growth of the threat from Philistine incursions, the Israelite tribes decided to form a strong centralised monarchy to meet the challenge, and the Tribe of Dan joined the new kingdom with Saul as the first king. After the death of Saul, all the tribes other than Judah remained loyal to the House of Saul.  But after the death of Ish-bosheth, Saul's son and successor to the throne of Israel, the Tribe of Dan joined the other northern Israelite tribes in making David, who was then the king of Judah, king of a re-united Kingdom of Israel. The tribe provided substantial military support for the kingdom in the form of 28,600 soldiers, being considered \"experts in war\".\n\nNorthern Kingdom of Israel\nHowever, on the accession of Rehoboam, David's grandson, in c. 930 BC the northern tribes split from the House of David to re-form a Kingdom of Israel as the Northern Kingdom.\n\nAssyrian conquest and demise\nAs part of the Kingdom of Israel, the territory of Dan was conquered by the Assyrians, and exiled; the manner of their exile led to their further history being lost.\n\nClaims of descent from Dan\nA 15th-century Latin chronicle, \"Chronicon Holsatiae vetus\", found in Gottfried Leibniz's Accessiones historicae (1698),\u00a0 states the Danes were of the Tribe of Dan. The antiquarian Henry Spelman in 1620 had made a similar claim that the Danes were the Israelite Tribe of Dan, based on the apparent similarity in name. Additionally, proponents of  Nordic and British Israelism have made similar claims about descent from the tribe of Dan. British Israelite authors such as John Cox Gawler and J. H. Allen identified the Tribe of Dan with Denmark. While another prominent British Israelite author, Edward Hine, took the view that the tribe of Dan had originated in Denmark and then migrated to the British Isles.\n\nSome Ethiopian Jews, also known as Beta Israel, claim descent from the Tribe of Dan, whose members migrated south along with members of the tribes of Gad, Asher, and Naphtali, into the Kingdom of Kush, now Ethiopia and Sudan, during the destruction of the First Temple. This position is supported by former Sephardic Chief Rabbi Ovadia Yosef. They are said to have fought with the natives. Charles Upton relates the serpent Haitian Vodou (voodoo) God Danbhala as derived in part from a heterodox form of Ethiopian Judaism, despite the Africans in Haiti deriving from West Africa, not Ethiopia.\n\nCharacteristics\nTheir primary trade characteristic was seafaring, unusual for the Israelite tribes. In the Song of Deborah the tribe is said to have stayed on their ships with their belongings.\n\nIconography\n\nModern artists use the \"scales of justice\" to represent the Tribe of Dan due to  referencing Dan \"shall achieve justice for his kindred\". More traditional artists use a snake to represent Dan, based upon Genesis 49:17, \"Let Dan be a serpent by the roadside, a horned viper by the path, That bites the horse's heel, so that the rider tumbles backward.\"\n\nBook of Revelation\nRevelation 7:4\u20138 mentions that people from the twelve tribes of Israel will be sealed. The selection of the twelve tribes does not include the names of Ephraim and Dan, although their names were used for the twelve tribes that settled in the Promised Land. It has been suggested that this could be because of their pagan practices. This led Irenaeus, Hippolytus of Rome and some Millennialists to propose that the Antichrist will come from the tribe of Dan.\n\nSee also\n Book of Judges\n British Israelism\n Dan (biblical figure)\n Denyen\n Nordic Israelism\n Ten Lost Tribes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n \nDan, Tribe of\nDenyen \nDanish people", "machine_text": "Tribe of Dan is one of the twelve tribes of Israel, as mentioned in the Old Testament. It is believed to have descended from Jacob's son, Dan. The tribe was allotted land on the Mediterranean coast, including the city of Jaffa, though it made an unsuccessful attempt to conquer Laish, which was later renamed Dan. The tribe of Dan is known for its symbol, the serpent, which is mentioned in the Bible. According to tradition, the emblem was chosen because of the incident where Samson killed a lion with his bare hands, and later found that a swarm of bees had made honey in the lion's carcass. Samson presented the honey to his parents, who saw it as a sign of the Lord's favor. The emblem of the serpent was also thought to represent Dan's craftiness, as it is said that he was able to outsmart the enemies of Israel. During the period of the Judges, the tribe of Dan is credited with producing two of the twelve judges, Samson and Shamgar. Samson is perhaps the most famous of the two, as he is remembered for his superhuman strength, which he used to fight against the Philistines. Shamgar, though not as well-known, is also remembered for his bravery in fighting the Philistines. In later times, the tribe of Dan was one of the first to separate from the kingdom of Israel, along with the tribe of Ephraim. According to tradition, they migrated north to the area around the city of Laish, where they established their own kingdom, which lasted for several centuries. Today, the tribe of Dan is no longer recognized as a distinct entity, but their legacy lives on in Jewish tradition and in the Old Testament.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 332563}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Villanovan culture\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Villanovan culture (c. 900\u2013700 BC), regarded as the earliest phase of the Etruscan civilization, was the earliest Iron Age culture of Italy. It directly followed the Bronze Age Proto-Villanovan culture which branched off from the Urnfield culture of Central Europe. The name derives from the locality of Villanova, a fraction of the municipality of Castenaso in the Metropolitan City of Bologna where, between 1853 and 1855, Giovanni Gozzadini found the remains of a necropolis, bringing to light 193 tombs, of which 179 to cremation and 14 to inhumation.\n\nThe Villanovans introduced iron-working to the Italian Peninsula. They practiced cremation and buried the ashes of their dead in pottery urns of distinctive double-cone shape.\n\nHistory\n\nThe name Villanovan of the early phases of the Etruscan civilization comes from the site of the first archaeological finds relating to this advanced culture, which were remnants of a cemetery found near Villanova (Castenaso, 12 kilometres south-east of Bologna) in northern Italy. The excavation lasting from 1853 to 1855 was done by the scholar and site owner, count Giovanni Gozzadini, and involved 193 tombs, six of which were separated from the rest as if to signify a special social status. The \"well tomb\" pit graves lined with stones contained funerary urns. These had been only sporadically plundered and most were untouched. In 1893, a chance discovery unearthed another distinctive Villanovan necropolis at Verucchio overlooking the Adriatic coastal plain.\n\nThe burial characteristics relate the Villanovan culture to the Central European Urnfield culture (c. 1300\u2013750 BC) and Celtic Hallstatt culture that succeeded the Urnfield culture. It is not possible to tell these apart in their earlier stages. Cremated remains were placed in cinerary urns, specifically in biconical urns and then buried. The urns were a form of Villanovan pottery known as impasto. A custom believed to originate with the Villanovan culture is the usage of hut-shaped urns, which were cinerary urns fashioned like the huts in which the villagers lived. Typical sgraffito decorations of swastikas, meanders, and squares were scratched with a comb-like tool. Urns were accompanied by simple bronze fibulae, razors and rings.\n\nPeriodization\nThe Villanovan culture is broadly divided into Villanovan I from c. 960 BC to c. 801 BC and the Villanovan II from c. 800 BC to 720 BC. The later phase (Villanovan II) saw radical changes, evidence of contact with Hellenic civilization and trade with the north along the Amber Road. This evidence takes the form of glass and amber necklaces for women, armor and horse harness fittings of bronze, and the development of elite graves in contrast to the earlier egalitarian culture. Chamber tombs and inhumation (burial) practices were developed side-by-side with the earlier cremation practices. With the last phase of Villanovan II the Etruscans, in particular Southern Etruria, entered the Orientalizing period. The northernmost areas of the Etruscan world, such as Etruria Padana, continued in their development as Villanovan III (750\u2013680 BC)  and Villanovan IV (680\u2013540 BC).\n\nVillanovan chronology within the Etruscan civilization\n\nMetalwork and trade \nThe metalwork quality found in bronze and pottery demonstrate the skill of the Villanovan artisans. Some grave goods from burial sites display an even higher quality, suggesting the development of societal elites within Villanovan culture. Tools and items were placed in graves suggesting a belief in an afterlife. Men's graves contained weapons, armor, while those for women included weaving tools. A few graves switched or mixed these, indicating the possibility that some women employed tools and that some men made clothing.\n\nDuring the Villanovan period Etruscans traded with other states from the Mediterranean such as Greeks, Balkans, and Sardinia. Trade brought about advancement in metallurgy, and Greek presence influenced Villanovan pottery.\n\nHousing \nBuildings were rectangular in shape. The people lived in small huts, made of wattle and daub with wooden poles for support. Within the huts, cooking stands, utensils and charred animal bones give evidence about the family life of early inhabitants in Italy. Some huts contained large pottery jars for food storage sunk into their floors. There was also a rock cut drain to channel rainwater to communal reservoirs.\n\nVillanovan settlements \nGenerally speaking, Villanovan settlements were centered in the Adriatic Etruria, in Emilia Romagna (in particular, in Bologna and in Verucchio, near Rimini), in Marche (Fermo), and in the Tyrrhenian Etruria, in Tuscany and Lazio. Further south, Villanovan cremation burials are to be found in Campania, at Capua, at the \"princely tombs\" of Pontecagnano near Salerno, at Capo di Fiume, at Vallo di Diano and at Sala Consilina.\n\nSmall scattered Villanovan settlements have left few traces other than their more permanent burial sites, which were set somewhat apart from the settlements\u2014largely because the settlement sites were built over in Etruscan times. Modern opinion generally follows Massimo Pallottino in regarding the Villanovan culture as ancestral to the Etruscan civilization.\n\nGenetics\nA genetic study published in Science in November 2019 examined the remains of a female from the Villanovan culture buried in Veio Grotta Gramiccia, Italy between ca. 900 BC and 800 BC. She carried the maternal haplogroup K1a4. and her autosomal DNA was a mixture of 72.9% Copper Age ancestry (EEF + WHG) and 27.1% Steppe-related ancestry. There was evidence for consanguinity for this sample with another ancient sample (700 BCE - 600 BCE) from the Etruscan necropolis of La Mattonara near Civitavecchia, compatible with being the latter an offspring of third-degree relatives from the former.\n\nSee also\nEtruscans\nProto-Villanovan culture\nPrehistoric Italy\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nSources and further reading\n\n \nGiovanni Gozzadini, La n\u00e9cropole de Villanova, Fava et Garagnani, Bologna, 1870\nJ.

This culture is named after the site of Villanova, near Bologna, where the first excavation was carried out in 1853. The Villanovan culture is characterized by its distinctive funerary practices, bronze-working techniques, and pottery styles. The Villanovan people were the first to settle in Etruria, the region that was later occupied by the Etruscans. They were organized into small tribes that lived in fortified villages and relied on agriculture and animal husbandry for their way of life. They developed a unique style of pottery with geometric designs and intricate patterns, which was traded throughout the Mediterranean. The Villanovan people are also famous for their intricate bronze-working techniques. They created a wide range of objects, including weapons, tools, and ornaments, which were used both for practical purposes and as status symbols. Villanovan bronzes are known for their abstract designs and exaggerated proportions, which reflect the artistic style of the time. Another distinctive feature of the Villanovan culture is their funerary practices. The Villanovan people believed in an afterlife, and they buried their dead in elaborate tombs with offerings of food, weapons, and other items. The tombs were often decorated with murals depicting scenes of everyday life, which provides insight into their culture and beliefs. The Villanovan culture declined in the 7th century BCE with the rise of the Etruscans, who absorbed many of their traditions and techniques. However, their legacy lives on in the art, architecture, and traditions of later civilizations that inhabited Central Italy, including the Etruscans and the Romans. Today, the Villanovan culture is studied by archaeologists, art historians, and scholars as a key period in the development of ancient Italy.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"When God Writes Your Love Story\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "When God Writes Your Love Story: The Ultimate Approach to Guy/Girl Relationships is a 1999 book by Eric and Leslie Ludy, an American married couple. After becoming a bestseller on the Christian book market, the book was republished in 2004 and then revised and expanded in 2009. It tells the story of the authors' first meeting, courtship, and marriage. The authors advise single people not to be physically or emotionally intimate with others, but to wait for the spouse that God has planned for them. The first edition was packaged with a CD single by the Ludys: \"Faithfully\", a song they had written specifically to accompany the book.\n\nThe book is divided into five sections and sixteen chapters. Each chapter is written from the perspective of one of the two authors; nine are by Eric, while Leslie wrote seven, as well as the introduction. The Ludys argue that one's love life should be both guided by and subordinate to one's relationship with God. Leslie writes that God offers new beginnings to formerly unchaste or sexually abused individuals.\n\nOther American Christian authors, such as Mark Matlock and Jason Evert, wrote highly of When God Writes Your Love Story. Leah Andrews of the Lewiston Morning Tribune compared When God Writes Your Love Story to other popular Christian books providing alternatives to dating, including Joshua Harris's I Kissed Dating Goodbye and Boy Meets Girl. Eastern University Christian studies professors Margaret and Dwight Peterson responded to the Ludys' book by writing an essay called \"God Does Not Want to Write Your Love Story,\" in which the Petersons argue that the book makes young people see marriage as a fantasy comparable to that of Disney Princesses, and that this fantasy often results in disappointment. Rick Holland, an instructor at The Master's College and Seminary and pastor of College and Student Ministries at Grace Community Church, criticized the Ludys' description of dating, claiming it was based too much on anecdotes and not enough on the Bible.\n\nBackground\nWhen God Writes Your Love Story, first published in the United States in 1999,  is the third book written by Eric and Leslie Ludy, an American married couple. Like the Ludys' previous two books, His Perfect Faithfulness: The Story of our Courtship (1996) and Romance God's Way (1997), its major themes are romance and Christianity; it tells the story of the authors' first meeting, courtship, and marriage. After becoming a bestseller on the Christian book market, When God Writes Your Love Story was republished in 2004 and then revised and expanded in 2009. More than 350,000 copies were sold worldwide by 2009. Translations of the book have been published in Spanish, German, and Traditional Chinese.\n\nEric and Leslie Ludy met when Eric was 21 and Leslie was 16. They pursued a friendship for several months before starting to court, and married in December 1994, the same month that Eric turned 24. In When God Writes Your Love Story, the Ludys advise single people not to be physically or emotionally intimate with others, but to wait for the life partner that God has planned for them; the Ludys suggest that one should marry this person rather than independently choosing a mate. Also focusing on premarital physical and emotional purity, the authors do not discuss the physical processes of sexual activity. Like many other Christian books about premarital romantic relationships, the Ludys' book explicitly does not present a set of rules to follow or a strategy for romantic success, but rather gives readers a framework for pursuing Christian romantic relationships; the book is intended to be a tool in the creation of the reader's unique romantic relationship rather than as a blueprint explaining what all Christian romantic relationships are supposed to look like.\n\nBefore the book's release, it was endorsed by Leslie and Les Parrott, authors of Saving Your Marriage Before It Starts; Beverly LaHaye of Concerned Women for America; and Joe White, President of Kanakuk Kamps. The first edition was packaged with a CD single by the Ludys: \"Faithfully\", a song they had written specifically to accompany the book, with lyrics discussing the beauty of having a life partner.\n\nContent\nThe book is divided into five sections and sixteen chapters. Each chapter is written from the perspective of one of the two authors; nine are by Eric, while Leslie writes seven, as well as the introduction. The first section, \"Desiring a Love Story\", addresses sexual desire and lovesickness, suggesting that temporary relationships cannot fulfill those longings. Section Two, \"Preparing for a Love Story\", advances ways in which one might, before initiating a romantic relationship, develop the characteristics of a good spouse. The next section, \"Waiting for a Love Story\", discusses the practice of fidelity to one's future spouse before meeting them by way of sexual abstinence and argues that waiting indefinitely is worth it even if one's soulmate never arrives. In the fourth section, \"Sweetening a Love Story\", the Ludys provide advice on how to proceed once the possibility of a romantic relationship has presented itself. The final section, \"Discovering a God-written Love Story\", argues that it is never too late to give God control of one's love life, and that this sacrifice should be made not in expectation of personal benefit but rather to benefit one's future spouse and to honor God.\n\nEarly in the book, Eric retells a portion of Homer's Odyssey, describing the episode in which Ulysses sails near the land of the Sirens: creatures whose song so attracts seafarers that they sail towards them and crash on the rocks. In this story, Ulysses orders all his men to fill their ears with beeswax and then tie him to the mast; the ship therefore sails through the area unharmed. Still, Ulysses, hearing the Sirens' song the entire time, is tortured by its beauty and his inability to get to the song's source. Eric follows this story with a retelling of the story of Orpheus's encounter with the Sirens. In this story, Orpheus's solution is to play a \"sweeter song\" than that of the Sirens; his ship also passes unharmed, his men so entranced by his song that they do not notice the Sirens. Eric then argues from analogy that, normally, those who force themselves to resist premarital sexual and romantic temptations are likely to find the process torturous (like Ulysses), while those who listen to the plans God has for them find waiting for marriage much easier (as it was for Orpheus's crew). Eric expands on the concept of the \"sweeter song\" throughout the book and often refers to it. Another frequently mentioned concept in the book is \"the beautiful side of love\"; the Ludys use this phrase to refer to a lasting, satisfying romance and contrast this state with such other experiences as breakups, unrequited love, and sexual frustration.\n\nThe Ludys argue that one's love life should be both guided by and subordinate to one's relationship with God. They suggest that, \"if God's plan and purpose for you is marriage, then the person you will one day marry\u00a0... is alive and wandering the earth\" and that this knowledge should encourage people to act in such a way that their future spouses would be pleased. The Ludys contest the definition of \"true love\" as an emotion; instead, they define \"true love\" as the choice to commit to another person no matter what happens. Eric writes that \"there are two ways each of us can approach life: spending our days meeting our needs or looking for ways to meet others' needs. The mystery is that when we spend our life focused on our own needs, we are never satisfied\u00a0... but when we pour out our life and focus on how we can serve others\u00a0... our deepest needs are met as well!\"\n\nLeslie argues that non-permanent relationships involving physical or emotional intimacy (or both) result in long-term psychological pain and that one should therefore only become physically or emotionally intimate with one's spouse. Eric retells the Greek myth of the suitors of Penelope, in which Penelope, whose husband Ulysses is erroneously believed to be dead, resists a large number of marriage proposals until Ulysses returns and kills the suitors. Eric uses the story to suggest that one should be faithful to one's future spouse even if it appears that they will never arrive. Eric argues that selfless service is an important part of marriage. He therefore suggests that a good way for a man to make himself ready for his future spouse is to serve his mother and sisters, and that single women should practice serving their fathers and brothers. Leslie writes that she is commonly asked the question \"How will I know when a relationship is from God?\" and her response is that people are likelier to recognize that a relationship is from God when they have a \"team\u00a0... made up of godly people who can keep us accountable to our commitments, pray with us, and provide a refreshing outside perspective.\" She indicates that this team should include one's parents or, if one does not have living Christian parents, other Christians of an older generation. She writes that God offers new beginnings to formerly unchaste or sexually abused individuals.\n\nCritical response\n\nDiscussions of context\n\nWhen God Writes Your Love Story is a popular Christian book that provides alternatives to dating. For this reason, Leah Andrews of the Lewiston Morning Tribune compared the book to Joshua Harris's I Kissed Dating Goodbye and Boy Meets Girl. When God Writes Your Love Story also contains Evangelical sexual abstinence teachings. Christine Gardner, a communications professor at Wheaton College, investigates such teachings in Making Chastity Sexy: The Rhetoric of Evangelical Abstinence Campaigns, and discusses the Ludys' book as part of this investigation. Gardner writes that she interviewed a twenty-two-year-old woman who had read When God Writes Your Love Story and \"desperately wanted God to write her love story, but she thought that she would help him out by filling in the blanks.\" Gardner argues that the result \"was a fractured fairy tale, one without a happy ending.\"\n\nIn the journal Critical Research on Religion, Courtney Ann Irby of Loyola University Chicago writes that the Ludys disparage secular American culture as overtly sexual and thus an obstacle to Christians. According to Irby, secular beliefs about dating are negatively presented in When God Writes Your Love Story and hookup culture is consistently discussed, although Irby indicates that, since the publication of the Ludys' book, some scholars have disputed the prevalence of casual sex in the United States. Irby suggests that the Ludys have no discernible qualifications to speak on the issues they discuss, but rather justify their message by emphasising their own personal experience as the reason for their authority. She writes that the Ludys recognize their lack of expertise and therefore emphasize trusting God as being more important than learning from the specific stories in the book. Irby suggests that the Ludys' book is, in these respects, similar to many other Evangelical books about premarital romantic relationships, such as Dannah Gresh's And the Bride Wore White, Elisabeth Elliot's Passion and Purity and Quest for Love, Don Raunikar's Choosing God's Best, Ben Young's and Sam Adams' The Ten Commandments of Dating, Henry Cloud's and John Townsend's Boundaries in Dating, Alex Chediak's 5 Paths to the Love of Your Life, and Joshua Harris's I Kissed Dating Goodbye and Boy Meets Girl.\n\nChristian responses to the book's advice\n\nChristine A. Col\u00f3n and Bonnie E. Field, two single women in their thirties, expressed their frustrations with the Ludys' book in Singled Out: Why Celibacy Must Be Reinvented in Today's Church. Col\u00f3n, an English professor at Wheaton College; and Field, a former English professor at Wayland Baptist University, criticize Leslie Ludy's account of her own wait for God to bring her a romantic partner. They argue that \"the language Ludy uses to describe her time of waiting and trusting implies a difficult and long struggle that is finally rewarded by God\" and suggests that a long wait results in an even greater reward, a concept that Col\u00f3n and Field, despite acknowledging as commonplace, disagree with and trace back to William Shakespeare's Cymbeline, which states \"the more delay'd, delighted.\" Singled Out suggests that, because Leslie was only 16 when she met Eric, her story is unlikely to inspire hope in older singles.\n\nCol\u00f3n and Field compare When God Writes Your Love Story to Derek Prince's God Is a Matchmaker, and argue that Prince's book better expresses the concept that God allows some people to receive their soulmates quickly, while requiring others to undergo a long wait. While the Ludys' book suggests that it is worth waiting for a soulmate because the wait indicates a better prize, Col\u00f3n and Field favour Prince's reasons for advocating waiting for one's soulmate, which are that doing so tests one's faith and that \"God has required many of His choicest servants to wait long periods for the fulfillment of His promise or purpose.\"\n\nMargaret and Dwight Peterson, an American married couple who are Christian Studies professors at Eastern University, teach a course together called \"Christian Marriage\" and were very critical of When God Writes Your Love Story. They responded to the Ludys' book by writing an essay called \"God Does Not Want to Write Your Love Story.\" They write therein that, while they read When God Writes Your Love Story, \"it began to dawn on us with particular clarity how different these stories of romance are from any traditionally Christian understanding of marriage.\" In response to Leslie Ludy's recommendation that a single woman should seek to be God's princess until becoming the princess of a human prince, the Petersons argue that this analogy makes young people see marriage as a fantasy comparable to that of Disney Princesses, and that this fantasy often results in disappointment. While referencing When God Writes Your Love Story specifically on several occasions, the Petersons acknowledge that the Ludys' book is one of many books with this premise and write that \"it is the entire genre that is problematic.\"\n\nRick Holland, an instructor at The Master's College and Seminary and pastor of College and Student Ministries at Grace Community Church, criticized the Ludys' description of dating, claiming it was based too much on anecdotes and not enough on the Bible. Nonetheless, he commended the couple on the relevant Bible verses they do quote and he argued that the advice the Ludys share in the book is sound and that their story is an encouraging one.\n\nWhen God Writes Your Love Story was received positively by some American Christian authors. In Freshman: The College Student's Guide to Developing Wisdom, Mark Matlock, an ordained minister and youth pastor recommends When God Writes Your Love Story to college students. He describes the Ludys' book as funny, honest, and candid. Jason Evert, a Catholic author and chastity speaker, wrote positively of When God Writes Your Love Story in his book If You Really Loved Me: 100 Questions on Dating, Relationships, and Sexual Purity. Evert commends Leslie Ludy writing about the importance of listening intently and regularly to God's voice in seeking discernment about romantic relationships. Also in If You Really Loved Me, Evert praises a passage from When God Writes Your Love Story in which Leslie Ludy recalls having spoken with a group of young men who all agreed that the most desirable women were those who were slow to establish strong emotional attachments to potential romantic partners, and that the least desirable women were those who were emotionally promiscuous. According to Evert, these men are right; he uses the passage to support his argument that lack of sexual experience is attractive.\n\nCommentators have also noted the song \"Faithfully\" that accompanied the book. The Petersons criticized it, arguing that its lyrics suggest that singles should seek a kind of unachievable perfection in their future marriage and spouse. On the other hand, in Eyes Wide Open: Avoiding the Heartbreak of Emotional Promiscuity, Brienne Murk, a Christian musician and public speaker, identifies \"Faithfully\" as one of her favourite songs.\n\nIn 22 and Single: A Coming of Age Story, Katie Kiesler wrote that, after reading the first chapter of When God Writes Your Love Story, she stopped because \"it was too hard to hear about the wonderful way in which God brought another perfect couple together \u2014 because it wasn't happening for me.\" She wrote that her friends kept recommending the book to her, even after she had tried starting it. She eventually decided that the reason she didn't like the book was her own selfishness in seeking to fulfill her own desires rather than leaving her desires for God to work out. She then read the book again, and wrote that God used her reading of it to make her thankful for her time as a single person. She also wrote that she found the book to be \"mostly about letting God's love overflow into all areas of your life rather than tales of perfect Christian couples.\"\n\nIn 2012, Clear Choices Pregnancy Resources Center, an American pro-life crisis pregnancy center operated by Christians in Grayson County, Kentucky, offered a course on the topic of sexual integrity that employed When God Writes Your Love Story and two other Christian books as its basis, the other two being Gary Chapman's The Five Love Languages and Bill and Pam Farrel's Single Men Are Like Waffles \u2014 Single Women Are Like Spaghetti.\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nExternal links\n Ellerslie, official website of Eric and Leslie Ludy\n\n1999 non-fiction books\n1999 in Christianity\n1999 in the United States\n20th-century Christian texts\nAmerican non-fiction books\nBooks about spirituality\nChristian devotional literature\nChristian theology books\nDating\nEnglish-language books\nEvangelicalism in the United States\nCollaborative non-fiction books\nMarriage in Christianity\nRandom House books\nSexual abstinence and religion\nNon-fiction books about sexuality\nSexuality in Christianity\nYoung adult non-fiction books", "machine_text": "When God Writes Your Love Story is a book written by Eric and Leslie Ludy, a couple who lives life with the main aim of serving God.

The book was first published by Uptone Press in Milwaukie, Oregon in 2005, with a later re-release by the author in 2017.\n\nPost Traumatic Slave Syndrome\nExpanding on a hypothesis of \"post-traumatic slavery syndrome\" by psychiatrist Alvin Francis Poussaint and journalist Amy L.

This manifests as a psychological, spiritual, emotional, and behavioral syndrome that results in a lack of self-esteem, persistent feelings of anger, and internalized racist beliefs.\n\nDeGruy states that PTSS is not a disorder that can simply be treated and remedied clinically but rather requires profound social change in individuals, as well as in institutions, that continue to reify inequality and injustice toward the descendants of enslaved Africans.\n\nThe theory has been generative of subsequent academic work in clinical psychology and black studies.\n\nReception\nIn addition to forming the basis of public lectures and workshops offered by DeGruy and her contemporaries, the research described in Post Traumatic Slave Syndrome inspired an eponymous play, which was staged at the Henry Street Settlement Experimental Theater, New York, in 2001.\n\nCritical scholars say that the PTSS hypothesis pathologizes African Americans and is itself racist.\n\nSee also \n Historical trauma\n Sociology of race and ethnic relations\n Weathering hypothesis\n\nReferences\n\n2005 non-fiction books\nNon-fiction books about American slavery\nPost-traumatic stress disorder\nAfrican-American history\nLiterature by African-American women\nAfrican-American studies publications", "machine_text": "Post Traumatic Slave Syndrome (PTSS) is a theory that describes the psychological and emotional trauma experienced by African American descendants of slavery in the United States. The concept was developed by Dr. Joy DeGruy in her book \"Post Traumatic Slave Syndrome: America's Legacy of Enduring Injury and Healing\". According to Dr. DeGruy's theory, the ongoing effects of slavery still have a significant impact on the lives of African Americans today. Slavery was a severe form of oppression that traumatized an entire population, leaving behind deep emotional and psychological wounds that have been passed down from generation to generation. Those wounds continue to impact the thoughts, behaviors, relationships and opportunity structures of African Americans. PTSS is characterized by a range of symptoms including depression, anxiety, anger, emotional numbing, and low self-esteem. These symptoms can be traced back to the many injustices and atrocities suffered by African Americans throughout their history, including enslavement, segregation, discrimination, and violence. The concept of PTSS has been criticized by some for its broad and generalized approach to a complex issue, but many scholars and advocates support it as a way to understand and address the ongoing effects of slavery and historical trauma. In recent years, there has been a growing movement to acknowledge and address the role of historical trauma in the lives of African Americans and other marginalized communities. This movement has led to new programs and initiatives designed to promote healing and resilience among those who have been affected by PTSS. Additionally, the recognition of PTSS has provided a basis for the development of policies and programs aimed at promoting social justice and equality.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 33046074}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Phyllachora maydis\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Phyllachora maydis is a plant pathogen causing ascomycete diseases in maize/corn, and is more commonly referred to as tar spot.\u00a0Identified by the distinctive development of stroma, this pathogen in itself is of little economic importance in the production of corn. However, the accompanying fungal infection of Monographella maydis, identified by \u201cfish-eye\u201d lesions, was claimed to cause significant foliar damage and subsequently yield reduction.  there is insufficient information about this pathogen and its management.\n\nSymptoms and signs\nThis pathogen is an obligate parasite solely of the species Zea mays. The first symptoms are yellowing spots on both upper and lower leaf surfaces.\u00a0Within the spot develops the characteristic black stromata over the ascomata, along with chlorosis of surrounding tissue. The chlorotic rings may be elliptical, circular, or may conjoin to form striping up to  long. Some of the chlorotic tissue around the ascomata may become necrotic with darker edges, forming the indicative  \u201cfish-eye\u201d. The presence of these lesions is not universal, nor is the association of these lesions with M. maydis. Research is ongoing to determine the exact cause of these lesions. Symptoms have been recorded as early as V3, but are most commonly observed during R3-R6 on or below the ear leaves.\n\nDisease cycle\nLittle is known about the progression of Phyllachora maydis. Presently, it is believed that the stromata overwinter on corn and soil residue. This is the primary inoculum that must be destroyed if the cycle is to be interrupted. Providing optimal temperatures, humidity and rainfall however, ascospores and conidia will be released in a gelatinous mass on the stromata. Both wind and precipitation are used to disperse the spores; however it is solely the ascospores that infect other plants. The role of conidia in the reproductive cycle is still unknown. The ascospores are released in bunches, and can travel as much as  with wind dispersion. Following infection, new stromata can form within 12\u201315 days in infected tissue, producing additional ascospores and conidia. Given the polycyclic nature of this pathogen, as well as the ability to infect corn at any developmental stage, it is extremely hard to manage.\n\nThe pathogen progresses from the lower leaves to the upper leaves and husks. As many as 4000 clypeus may form on a leaf, resulting in 80% of affected leaf area. Given optimal conditions, total leaf death can occur in as little as twenty one days.\n\nDistribution\nNative to the Americas, from Mexico south, P. maydis appeared in the US for the first time in 2015 in Illinois and Indiana, then Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, Minnesota, Missouri, and Wisconsin in 2019. Tar spot appeared in Wisconsin in Green and Iowa counties in 2016, and had become a serious problem by 2018. When surveyed by the university and DATCP, it was found that 33 counties had recorded cases, and 77 of 79 fields surveyed, or 97 percent, showed signs.\n\nEnvironment\nIn Latin America, the disease propagated quickly in temperatures ranging from  with high humidity. Long periods of moisture on the leaf surface also increased the disease incidence. However, in the Midwest, it is still unknown as to the conditions that are preferred by the pathogen. During 2015 and 2018 when there was a high incidence of tar spot, the weather was warmer with high humidity and precipitation frequency, possibly attributing to the increased number of cases reported. Additional research is needed to understand the optimal conditions for propagation of this disease in the Midwest.\n\nManagement\nA basic control measure that could be implemented is residue management. By tilling the field and rotating crops, this helps reduce the primary inoculum that overwinters on stalks and other residue. A biological control method that has shown potential is the infection with Coniothyrium phyllochorae by reducing lesion size due to hyperparasitism. Chemical control with one or two treatments of Fenpropimorph or Mancozeb applied every ten days were the most effective fungicides used in field trials. Although no cultivars currently exist that are immune to this pathogen, CIMMYT has developed 14 inbred lines in Latin America that are highly resistant. However, most hybrids used in the Midwest have proven susceptible.\n\nEconomic importance\nTar spot causes low ear weight, vivipary, and poor kernel fill resulting in up to a 30 bushel loss per acre. Increased lodging and stalk rot have also been associated with intense cases. Losses have become severe in some areas of the USA since 2018.\n\nSee also\n Rhytisma acerinum, also called tar spot\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\nPhyllachorales\nFungal plant pathogens and diseases\nMaize diseases", "machine_text": "Phyllachora maydis is a plant pathogenic fungus known to cause leaf spot disease in maize (Zea mays). This fungus infects maize plants globally and can cause significant yield losses in infected crops if not managed effectively. Identification and Symptoms: Phyllachora maydis can be identified from the presence of circular to elongated spots that appear on the maize leaves during the early stages of infection. These spots later develop into dark brown, oval-shaped lesions with yellow halos. The center of the lesions may dry out and become papery, leading to the development of numerous small, dark fungal fruiting bodies (acervuli) on the underside of the leaf. Pathology and Transmission: Phyllachora maydis infects maize plants through the stomata, hydathodes, and wounds on the leaves and stems. The spores of the fungus can be dispersed by rain, wind, or contact with infected plant debris, leading to increased infection rates. The fungus can also overwinter on plant debris and soil, infecting new plants during the following growing seasons. Management: Effective management of Phyllachora maydis is essential to prevent significant yield losses in maize crops. Cultural practices such as crop rotation, removal of infected plant residues, and the use of disease-free seeds can significantly reduce the incidence of the disease. Fungicides can also be used to manage the disease, but need to be applied at the right time and dosage to achieve the desired effects. Importance: Maize is an essential crop for food security and economic development in many parts of the world. Phyllachora maydis is a significant pathogen of maize, and its management is essential to ensure sustainable maize production. This fungus affects not only the leaves but also the stalks, leading to lodging and reduction in grain quality, factors that can significantly affect maize yields. Conclusion: Phyllachora maydis is a fungal pathogen responsible for the leaf spot disease in maize that has led to significant yield losses worldwide. Understanding the pathology, symptoms, and management of this fungus is critical in preventing and mitigating their impact on maize production. Researchers continue to study the pathogen to improve its management strategies and develop effective control measures.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 62563135}

In the 1920s, he began to work on graphic design,\napplying the principles of De Stijl and constructivism to commercial advertising. Along with Gerard Kiljan and his famous colleague Piet Zwart, he followed ideas pioneered in the Soviet Union by El Lissitzky and Rodchenko, in Poland by Henryk Berlewi and in Germany by Kurt Schwitters.\n\nDuring his employment at  the NV Maatschappij Van Berkel Patent scale company in Rotterdam, Schuitema gained recognition for his original designs of stationery and publicity material, often using only the colors black, red and white and bold sans serif fonts. From 1926 on, he started working with photomontages, becoming one of the pioneers of this technique in the field of industrial design. Schuitema was a member of Nederlandsche Vereeniging voor Ambachts- en Nijverheidskunst (V.A.N.K.) the Dutch Association for Craft and Craft Art.\n\nEven though he was a convinced socialist and often designed leftist publications directed at industrial workers, Schuitema also worked for major companies, such as Philips.\n\nPost-war filmmaker\nDuring the final years of World War II, Schuitema, along with Jan Bouman, Lou Lichtveld and Eduard Verschueren, began planning for the post-war art community in the Netherlands. In 1944, the four publish a \"Report on Stimulation, Development and Organization of the Film Industry in the Netherlands\" (Rapport inzake de stimuleering, ontwikkeling en ordening van het Filmwezen in Nederland).\n\nFollowing Dolle Dinsdag (5 September 1944), he officially joined the resistance forces, assuming a leadership role in the National Film and Photo Reportage Service. After the end of the war, Schuitema and his three partners founded the Dutch Cooperative for Film Production (Nederlandse Werkgemeenschap voor Filmproductie,  NWF) in Haarlem and gave the impulse for the formation of the Dutch Film Makers Guild (Beroepsvereniging van Nederlandse Cineasten). In each case, membership was restricted to those artists whose conduct during the occupation was irreproachable.\n\nIn 1946, Schuitema presented his short film \"Les Ponts de la Meuse\" at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nInfluence\n\nHis techniques influenced the Wild Plakken design collective of the late 20th century.\n\nSee also\n Typographica\n\nLiterature\nDick Maan, Paul Schuitema.

In 1923, he moved to The Hague and joined the De Stijl group, where he became a close collaborator of artists such as Piet Mondrian, Theo van Doesburg, and Vilmos Husz\u00e1r. Schuitema was inspired by the De Stijl principles of abstraction, simplicity, and geometric purity, which he applied to his work as a graphic designer. Schuitema's designs were characterized by their clarity, precision, and economy of form. He experimented with photomontage, using photographic images and typography to create new visual languages. His work was influential in the development of the New Typography movement, which advocated for the use of sans-serif fonts, asymmetrical layouts, and clean lines in graphic design. Schuitema was also a pioneering photographer, using the camera as a tool for experimentation and abstraction. He explored the visual possibilities of industrial and urban landscapes, creating compositions of shapes, lines, and textures that highlighted the beauty of the everyday. His photographs were exhibited in major international exhibitions, including the influential Film und Foto exhibition in Stuttgart in 1929. After World War II, Schuitema continued working as a graphic designer, creating posters, logos, and visual identities for clients such as Philips, Heineken, and Shell.

It was also the club's 150th year in existence and to mark the occasion the club had a special crest and the away kit was the same colours that Stoke Ramblers wore back in 1863, navy and cardinal Stoke also had a new shirt sponsor Bet365 taking over from Britannia.\n\nThe summer of 2012 saw the departure of fan favourite Ricardo Fuller whilst in came winger Michael Kightly and USA defender Geoff Cameron, later followed by Charlie Adam and Steven Nzonzi. Stoke began the season with four straight draws and an embarrassing League Cup exit to Swindon Town. Despite recording one victory in their opening ten match they did  put in some impressive performances away at Chelsea and Manchester United and at home to champions Manchester City. Stoke then went ten matches undefeated from 10 November to 29 December with a 3\u20131 victory over Liverpool on boxing day the stand out result.\n\nDuring that run Stoke conceded just seven goals but at the turn of the year their form and performances dropped off as in the next ten matches Stoke picked up just five points, scored only six goals and conceded 19. Results and performances failed to improve and after an awful defeat at home to Aston Villa, Stoke were in danger of being involved in the relegation battle. Back to back wins against Queens Park Rangers and Norwich City lifted Stoke away from the foot of the table and they recovered to finish in 13th position with 42 points. At the end of the season manager Tony Pulis left the club by mutual consent bringing an end to his seven-year tenure at the club. He was replaced by the former Wales, Blackburn Rovers, Manchester City, Fulham and Queens Park Rangers manager Mark Hughes.\n\nPre-season\nThere was expectation that several players would leave the club in the summer with a number reaching the end of their contacts and chairman Peter Coates said that Tony Pulis will have to sell if he wants to buy. Pulis released Louis Moult, Tom Soares, Salif Diao and club legend Ricardo Fuller after the end of their contracts and Jonathan Woodgate and Danny Collins left for Middlesbrough and Nottingham Forest respectively. On 8 August Wolverhampton Wanderers winger Michael Kightly joined that club for an undisclosed fee.\n\nFor the 2012\u201313 pre-season, Stoke travelled to the United States where they will spend eleven days and play matches against Major League Soccer sides Columbus Crew and Sporting Kansas City as well as affiliated USL Pro club Orlando City. Matches were also arranged against Swiss side FC Sion and German Bundesliga team SpVgg Greuther F\u00fcrth.\n\nStoke began their pre-season in Switzerland and played a match against FC Sion which was won 1\u20130 thanks to a penalty from Matthew Etherington. City then travelled to The USA and played their first match against the Columbus Crew. Despite taking the lead via Jonathan Walters the Americans were much brighter and scored twice through Aaron Horton and Ben Speas. The next match against affiliated club Orlando City saw Stoke win 1\u20130 with Walters scoring his second goal of pre-season but it was marred with Glenn Whelan being sent off after a harmless altercation with former Stoke midfielder James O'Connor. Stoke's final match in USA against Sporting Kansas City saw Stoke miss a number of chances but did eventually take the lead with six minutes left when Michael Tonge whose only contribution to the club is in pre-season was fouled in the area and he scored the spot kick. Stoke however conceded a comical equaliser as Asmir Begovi\u0107's clearance went straight to Kyle Miller who had the easy task of heading the ball into an empty net.\n\nOn their return to England they played two matches against Football League opposition, Torquay United and Yeovil Town. Both matches ended 1\u20131 and they had a Polish international trialist Sebastian Boenisch playing at left back. The final match of pre-season saw Stoke take on German side SpVgg Greuther F\u00fcrth in Bavaria. New signing Michael Kightly made a perfect start to his Stoke career scoring with his first touch. Matthew Upson gave away a penalty and Bernd Nehrig scored from the spot and for the four time in pre-season that match finished 1\u20131. Afterwards Tony Pulis revealed that Stoke had agreed to take Macedonian left back Goran Popov on loan from Dynamo Kyiv until the end of the season. However the move collapsed as he failed to gain a work permit.\n\nPremier League\n\nAugust\n\nStoke's first league match of the 2012\u201313 season saw them come up against newly promoted Reading at the Madejski Stadium. New signing Michael Kightly made his league debut and marked it with scoring the opening goal albeit thanks to an error from \"Royals\" goalkeeper Adam Federici. The home side were not posing much of a threat to Stoke's goal but they were gifted the chance to equalise in the final minute of the match as Dean Whitehead brought down Garath McCleary in the area and conceded a penalty, and to make matters worse for Whitehead he was shown a second yellow. Adam Le Fondre made no mistake from the spot and it was a case of two points dropped for Stoke.\n\nThe first home match of the season was against old adversaries Arsenal with the match being broadcast live on TV. Geoff Cameron made his first appearance in a red and white shirt and produced a good performance in a match which surprisingly failed to live up to the buildup. There were few moments of excitement with Jonathan Walters having Stoke's best effort, hitting the back of the net but it was ruled out for offside. The \"Gunners\" struggled to make Asmir Begovi\u0107 work in the City goal and the match finished in a rather tame goalless draw. On transfer deadline day Stoke completed the signings of midfielders Charlie Adam, Maurice Edu and Steven Nzonzi.\n\nSeptember\nCharlie Adam and Maurice Edu were both on the bench for the match at 'bogey' side Wigan Athletic. Stoke made a terrible start to the match conceding a penalty after just four minutes after Robert Huth handled in the area and Shaun Maloney made no mistake from the spot. The away support were beginning to vent their frustration towards Pulis but after half an hour he brought on Adam for his debut. He impressed instantly with his passing ability and Stoke were awarded a penalty of their own just before half time, Jonathan Walters scoring for Stoke. But poor defending at the start of the second half gifted Franco Di Santo a goal and Stoke were again chasing the match. Peter Crouch scored his first league goal of the season and Stoke could have won it but for a wonder save from Ali Al-Habsi denying Adam a debut goal.\n\nOn 4 September Stoke announced the signing of former Real Madrid and England striker Michael Owen on a one-year contract. Nzonzi and Adam made their home debuts against Premier League title holders Manchester City as Stoke lined up in a new look formation which included three centre midfielders. And it was Stoke who took the lead via Peter Crouch, although TV replays showed that he handled in the buildup. Stoke then had to as expected weather a lot of pressure from Man City but they leveled from a set play, Javi Garc\u00eda being left unmarked. Michael Owen came off the bench for the final few moments as Begovi\u0107 and Shawcross prevented Manchester City winning the match late on. It was Stoke's fourth draw in a row and all from the start of a season, a club record. After the match Andy Wilkinson was handed a three match ban after an off the ball altercation with Mario Balotelli.\n\nStoke then played Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, and were the better side for most of the 90 minutes. They had chances to take the points with Walters hitting the crossbar and Kightly and Crouch guilty of missed opportunities and Chelsea took full advantage with Ashley Cole scoring with five minutes left handing Stoke an undeserved defeat.\n\nStoke went into their next match at home to Swansea looking for their first win of the season and that's what they got after a simple enough victory. Michael Laudrup's Swansea as expected enjoyed a large amount of possession but they never threatened to trouble Stoke's defence and Peter Crouch scored twice before half time to settle the contest.\n\nOctober\n\nPrior to the League match against Liverpool Stoke were handed a boost when captain Ryan Shawcross earned a call up to the England team. The match against Liverpool saw both sides cancel each other out in a bad tempered 0\u20130 draw.\n\nAfter the international break Stoke completed their tough set of opening fixtures away at Manchester United. Stoke made a great start and took the lead through an own goal by Wayne Rooney and Stoke could have added to their goal tally with Adam and Walters going close. But poor defending cost Stoke dearly as Rooney, Robin van Persie and Danny Welbeck saw the \"Red Devils\" turn the match in their favour. Kightly pulled one back but Rooney scored his second goal to make it 4\u20132.\n\nThe next match saw Stoke and Sunderland play out an uneventful and lifeless goalless draw at the Britannia but it proved to be a costly one for Stoke as left back Marc Wilson broke his fibula.\n\nNovember\n\nStoke then put in a poor performance away at Norwich City going down by a solitary goal from Bradley Johnson.\n\nStoke went into their next match then against bottom of the table Queens Park Rangers looking for a much needed win. It was a scrappy encounter with Rangers' Adel Taarabt causing City's defence problems with his skill but were also thankful for his poor decision making which left him squandering QPR's best chances. Charlie Adam scored his first goal for Stoke just after half time and that proved to be the winning goal.\n\nStoke's next match was against in form West Ham United moved to a Monday night for live TV coverage. Stoke began the match brightly and scored through Walters after 13 minutes via a well worked corner routine. City continued to dominate the first half and almost scored again but Nzonzi's powerful shot cannoned off the woodwork. However it was role reversal in the second half at the \"Hammers\" took control of the game and soon levelled through Joey O'Brien but Stoke fought off West Ham's revival and earned a decent point.\n\nStoke then began a three-game week with a home match against Fulham and for the second match at the Britannia the match was settled by a single goal from Charlie Adam. Stoke had several chances to win by a bigger margin but were guilty of poor finishing.\n\nThe mid-week match against an out of form Newcastle United side saw Stoke come from behind to claim a late victory. Papiss Ciss\u00e9 put the \"Magpies\" in front just after half time capitalising on an error from Glenn Whelan. Substitutes Kenwyne Jones and Cameron Jerome then came off the bench to spark Stoke's turnaround. Firstly, Jerome provided an assist for Jonathan Walters and then scored the winning goal after being set up by Jones.\n\nDecember\n\nStoke's then played high-flying West Bromwich Albion who at the time were in the top four. Stoke produced a disciplined defensive performance nullifying Albion's attack and grabbed a 1\u20130 win thanks to a rare goal from Dean Whitehead.\n\nStoke again played away at Midlands opponents this time Aston Villa and both sides cancelled each other out in a drab goalless draw. Stoke had Ryan Shotton sent off for two bookable offences.\n\nStoke then played out a bruising 1\u20131 draw with Everton on 15 December. The \"Toffees\" took the lead after Steven Pienaar's cross was deflected into the net by Ryan Shawcross and the visitors almost scored again soon after with Leon Osman missing from close range. Stoke levelled thanks to Kenwyne Jones' first league goal since August 2011 but the major indecent of the match saw Marouane Fellaini deliberately headbutt Shawcross which was missed by referee Mark Halsey. After the match Fellaini issued a public apology to Shawcross and was given a retrospective three match ban.\n\nCity then earned their fifth goalless draw of the season (10th in total) with an impressive defensive display at Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nOn Boxing day City took on Liverpool in a late evening kick-off and the visitors took the lead very early on as after just 30 seconds Luis Su\u00e1rez was fouled in the area and Steven Gerrard scored the spot kick. Stoke instantly replied with Walters and then Jones to turn the game around and victory was completed in the second half with Walters scoring a second to earn Stoke a 3\u20131 win.\n\nThe final match of 2012 saw another incident packed 90 minutes against Southampton. Stoke without key defensive duo Shawcross and Cameron saw the \"Saints\" take the lead through Rickie Lambert but Stoke soon levelled though a Jones back heel. Then two awful defensive mistakes gave the away side a 3\u20131 lead. Stoke pulled one back through Matthew Upson midway through the second half and then had Steven Nzonzi sent off for an apparent stamp on Jack Cork. Stoke did make it 3\u20133 with Cameron Jerome scoring from 30 yards in the final minute. Nzonzi's red card was later rescinded by the FA.\n\nJanuary\n\nStoke began 2013 with another tame 3\u20130 defeat away at Manchester City on 1 January, ending Stoke's ten-match unbeaten run. Manchester City were in complete control of the match and only their poor finishing prevented them taking the lead. Eventually they did break the deadlock just before half-time after James Milner's cross was blocked by Begovi\u0107 but Pablo Zabaleta was able to score the rebound. The second half continued in the same vein and after Sergio Ag\u00fcero's shot was parried by the Stoke keeper his compatriot Edin D\u017eeko scored a simple tap-in. Stoke tried to hit back through a Charlie Adam free-kick before Walters blazed a shot over from close-range. Stoke's misery was compounded when Nzonzi fouled David Silva and conceded a penalty which Ag\u00fcero converted, with Nzonzi receiving a yellow card for the foul.\n\nChelsea then ended Stoke's 11-month unbeaten home run in the Premier League in emphatic fashion beating Stoke 4\u20130. However it was a harsh scoreline as Chelsea's goals came from two own goals from, Jonathan Walters a Frank Lampard penalty and a long-range effort from Eden Hazard. To add to Walters' woe he also missed a last minute penalty.\n\nStoke's awful start to 2013 continued with a poor 3\u20131 loss at Swansea City After a goalless first half Swansea dominated the second period and took the lead through their full-back Ben Davies. After Adam had fouled Michu, Dutch midfielder Jonathan de Guzm\u00e1n curled in the free-kick and then Jerome missed an easy chance to pull one back for Stoke. de Guzm\u00e1n ended the game as a contest when he scored to complete a flowing Swansea move although Stoke did manage to get a consolation goal, Michael Owen scoring in the final minute for what was his 150th Premier League goal.\n\nStoke then threw away a two-goal lead against Wigan Athletic on 29 January, their fourth 2\u20132 draw with Wigan in four seasons. Stoke ended the month by completing the transfers of USA international Brek Shea and England goalkeeper Jack Butland.\n\nFebruary\n\nStoke continued their poor run with a narrow 1\u20130 defeat at Arsenal courtesy of a Lukas Podolski free-kick.\n\nStoke secured their first league win of 2013 against Reading. After a goalless first half Stoke scored through a Robert Huth header and a fine goal from Jerome but the Royals quickly responded with Adrian Mariappa heading a late corner but Stoke held on for a 2\u20131 victory.\n\nAfter a two-week international break Stoke travelled to Craven Cottage to take on Fulham. Stoke failed to improve on their terrible away record of one win in 23 as Martin Jol's side won 1\u20130 thanks to a fine volley from Dimitar Berbatov. Stoke had the chance to earn a point from the penalty spot but Walters's kick was weak and easily saved by Mark Schwarzer. It got worse for Stoke as Huth was given a retrospective three match ban after an off the ball altercation with Philippe Senderos.\n\nMarch\n\nWith Huth suspended Marc Wilson filled in a centre back against West Ham United in what was another poor performance by Stoke. West Ham scored the only goal via Jack Collison and the Stoke supporters began to vent their frustration at manager Tony Pulis.\n\nStoke's next away match was against Newcastle United and Stoke took the lead in the second half with Walters converting a penalty which he won. Stoke could not hold out for a point though as the Magpies drew level through a Yohan Cabaye free-kick and then Papiss Ciss\u00e9 scored in the final minute to extended Stoke's losing run to three matches.\n\nThe Midlands derby against West Brom was a good opportunity for Stoke to end their poor form but it turned out to be a frustrating afternoon. There was few chances from both sides and Stoke's best chance came in the final minute through Kenwyne Jones but he could only hit his shot straight at Ben Foster and the match finished in a drab 0\u20130 draw.\n\nStoke's final game of a barren March saw them travel to Everton. Stoke missed a glorious chance to take an early lead after a Ryan Shotton long throw-in was headed towards goal by Huth and saved by Tim Howard, Walters could only hit the crossbar. Everton had a couple half-chances though Nikica Jelavi\u0107 before they scored in fine style. A Marc Wilson cross was punched away by Howard and the ball fell for Belgian Kevin Mirallas who broke clear of the retreating Stoke defence and slotted the ball past Begovi\u0107. Stoke had chances in the second half to pull level but failed to take them with Walters, Huth, Shotton and Jerome all guilty of poor finishing and Everton won the match 1\u20130.\n\nApril\n\nStoke entered the final six games of the 2012\u201313 season with a vital home match against Midlands rivals Aston Villa at the Britannia Stadium. Stoke got off to an awful start after poor defending let in Gabriel Agbonlahor to score after ten minutes. Stoke failed to trouble Brad Guzan and Villa almost scored again through Andreas Weimann whose shot hit the post. City improved marginally after the break and scored in the 80th minute through substitute Michael Kightly. But Villa defender Matthew Lowton then scored an unstoppable goal, a volley from 30 yards and with Stoke pushing for an equaliser they were caught on the counterattack and Christian Benteke sealed a 3\u20131 win and left Stoke fully involved in the relegation fight.\n\nStoke's slide towards the relegation zone continued with 2\u20130 home defeat against champions elect Manchester United on 14 April. The Potters made an awful start conceding after just four minutes after a Robin van Persie corner was not dealt with by the Stoke defence and the ball was prodded in by Michael Carrick. Stoke rarely threatened David de Gea and when he was finally tested by Charlie Adam Stoke gave away a penalty after Wilkinson fouled van Persie in the area who converted the spot kick. Pulis decided to impose a media ban for the remainder of the season on his players in order to 'keep them focused'.\n\nCity then travelled to lowly Queens Park Rangers and came away with a vital 2\u20130 victory only their 2nd win of 2013. Peter Crouch scored for the first time since January and a Walters penalty lifted Stoke six points away from danger.\n\nStoke then beat Norwich City 1\u20130 on 27 April to move them onto the 40 point mark in a match which saw the supporters pay tribute to former player Paul Ware. Charlie Adam scored the only goal of the game just after half-time, Stoke could have added a second but Crouch was guilty of some poor finishing.\n\nMay\n\nStoke played relegation threatened Sunderland on 6 May and Stoke took a 9th-minute lead through Walters after Sunderland failed to clear a Charlie Adam corner. It got worse for the Black Cats as Craig Gardner was sent-off for a foul on Adam just before half time. However Sunderland managed to earn a point thanks to a goal from John O'Shea.\n\nThe last home match of the 2012\u201313 season against Tottenham Hotspur was used as a 'celebration match' for the club's 150th anniversary. To mark the occasion 80 former players attended the match and performed a lap of honour whilst the supporters received a free T-shirt. Stoke started the match brilliantly with Steven Nzonzi scoring his first goal for City after just three minutes. Spurs levelled through Clint Dempsey who punished a defensive mix-up between Wilson and Begovi\u0107. Just after half time Stoke's task was made harder when Charlie Adam picked up a second yellow card meaning Stoke had to play the remaining 40 minutes with ten men. Stoke couldn't hold on to a draw as Emmanuel Adebayor scored the winning goal for Spurs.\n\nStoke ended the 2012\u201313 season with a 1\u20131 draw away at Southampton, Crouch scoring just after half time for Stoke before Rickie Lambert made sure the season ended with a draw. It proved to be Pulis' final game in charge of Stoke as two days later he left the club by mutual consent. He was replaced by fellow Welshman Mark Hughes. This was also the final match in Michael Owen's career, in only his 8th appearance for Stoke he got a standing ovation from both set of fans.\n\nResults\n\nFinal league table\n\nFA Cup\n\nStoke were drawn away at Championship side Crystal Palace in the third round and the match at Selhurst Park saw both sides cancel each other out in a 0\u20130 draw meaning that a replay would be required.\n\nThe replay was a far more eventful affair which began with the tricky Wilfried Zaha winning a penalty but Jermaine Easter's spot kick was saved by S\u00f8rensen. Kenwyne Jones put Stoke in front on 70 minutes before Palace were awarded another penalty which Glenn Murray converted to send the tie into extra time. With Palace tiring Stoke took full advantage and a brace from Walters and a last minute strike from Cameron Jerome earned Stoke a 4\u20131 victory.\n\nThe fourth round saw a repeat of the 2011 FA Cup Final, unfortunately for Stoke the outcome was the same, Man City winning 1\u20130, thanks to a late strike from Pablo Zabaleta.\n\nLeague Cup\n\nStoke were on the receiving end of a cup upset as League One Swindon Town knocked Stoke out in the second round. The \"Robins\" showed no fear at playing at the Britannia Stadium and took the lead through James Collins after a Thomas S\u00f8rensen mistake. Swindon and Collins scored again just before half time and they also had chances to increase their goal tally much to the anger of Stoke fans who booed their team off at half time. In the second half Stoke scored through Kenwyne Jones and Jonathan Walters to send the tie into extra time. However, despite squandering their two-goal lead Swindon were not affected and scored again through Aden Flint but Peter Crouch replied for Stoke. Jamie Ness had to leave the action after picking up an injury and it seemed it would go all the way to a penalty shoot-out but Collins beat the offside trap and claimed his hat-trick and victory for Paolo Di Canio's Swindon.\n\nSquad statistics\n\nTransfers\n\nIn\n\nOut\n\nLoan out\n\nReferences\n\nStoke City\nStoke City F.C. seasons", "machine_text": "The 2012-13 Stoke City F.C. season was a season of mixed fortunes for the club. Stoke finished the season in 13th place in the Premier League, which represented a dip in form from the previous two seasons when they finished 11th and 14th respectively. Despite the drop in league position, Stoke enjoyed some memorable moments throughout the campaign. One of the standout moments of the season came in a 3-1 home victory over Liverpool. Stoke turned in an impressive display as goals from Jonathan Walters, Kenwyne Jones, and Cameron Jerome secured all three points. Other notable performances included a 2-0 home win over Fulham, a 1-1 draw away at Arsenal and a 2-0 victory against QPR at Loftus Road. One of the key players for Stoke that season was midfielder Steven Nzonzi. The Frenchman put in a string of impressive displays in the middle of the park and his performances earned him a move to Blackburn Rovers at the end of the season. Despite the positives, there were also some disappointments for Stoke. The club suffered a humiliating 4-0 defeat at the hands of Chelsea in the FA Cup, and were also knocked out of the League Cup in the fourth round by Swansea City. Overall, while the 2012-13 season was not one of Stoke's best, there were still some memorable moments for fans to savour. Despite their struggles, Stoke still managed to secure a comfortable mid-table finish and would go on to build on this in future seasons.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 35768080}

The sub made a surface transit to Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay for drydocking and repairs within a few days, and San Diego required dry dock repairs that were completed 10 April 1989.  As a result of this collision, COMSUBLANT issued orders limiting submarine speed and passing activities while in the restricted waters of the Hampton Roads channels.\n\nOn 25 August 2004, Norfolk returned to Naval Station Norfolk after a 22-month Engineering Refueling Overhaul (ERO) at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine.\n\nNorfolk was decommissioned on 11 December 2014 at her homeport of Naval Station Norfolk in Virginia.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\nnavsource.org: USS Norfolk\n \nJonas Ingram Sinkex, but does not mention Norfolk\n\nShips built in Newport News, Virginia\nLos Angeles-class submarines\nCold War submarines of the United States\nNuclear submarines of the United States Navy\nUnited States submarine accidents\nMaritime incidents in 1989\nUnited States Navy Virginia-related ships\n1981 ships", "machine_text": "USS Norfolk (SSN-714) is a United States Navy Los Angeles-class submarine that was built by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company in Virginia. The submarine was commissioned on May 21, 1983, and has since been serving the US Navy in various capacities. The ship is named after the city of Norfolk, Virginia. The USS Norfolk has participated in numerous military operations and exercises, including anti-submarine warfare, maritime interdiction, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions. One of the most notable operations in which the submarine participated was the Desert Shield and Desert Storm campaigns in the early 1990s. During these operations, the Norfolk played a crucial role in supporting the US Navy's efforts in the Persian Gulf. The submarine has undergone several modernizations throughout its service. In 1999, the Norfolk underwent an extensive overhaul and was equipped with the latest technology, including the VLS (Vertical Launch System) for Tomahawk missiles. The upgrade also included modifications to the submarine's engines and the addition of new sensors and navigation systems. In October 2017, the USS Norfolk was one of three US Navy submarines that visited the port of Busan in South Korea as part of a show of force following North Korea's sixth nuclear test. The visit was also aimed at strengthening the US-South Korean alliance and sending a message of deterrence to North Korea. As of 2021, the USS Norfolk continues to serve the US Navy in its mission of protecting the country's interests around the world. The submarine has received numerous awards and accolades for its service, including the Navy Unit Commendation, the Meritorious Unit Commendation, and the National Defense Service Medal.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1121679}

It was written by the band's lead vocalist and songwriter, David Byrne. Heaven is known for its infectious guitar riff and Byrne's introspective lyrics. The song explores themes of mortality, spirituality and the afterlife, with Byrne questioning whether heaven truly exists or whether it's simply a figment of human imagination. The song's opening lines, \"Everyone is trying to get to the bar / The name of the bar, the bar is called heaven / The band in heaven plays my favorite song / They play it once again, they play it all night long,\" have become iconic among fans of Talking Heads. Heaven was initially met with mixed reviews upon its release, with some critics finding it too straightforward compared to the band's earlier experimental sound. However, over time, the song has become one of the band's most beloved and enduring tracks, frequently appearing on lists of the greatest songs of all time. In addition to its appearance on Fear of Music, Heaven has also been included on several of Talking Heads' greatest hits compilations, including the aptly titled Popular Favorites: Sand in the Vaseline. The song has been covered by numerous artists, including the band Weezer, who recorded a version for the soundtrack to the 2017 film Cars 3. Heaven remains an essential part of Talking Heads' legacy, a song that serves as a potent reminder of the band's unique blend of artistry and accessibility, as well as their ability to wrestle complex ideas and emotions into pop songs that pack a powerful punch.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 13120897}

She then completed her studies at the University of Melbourne Architectural Atelier and was the only one to receive honours in her first year in 1928. Graduating in 1930 she was awarded the Grice Bronze Medal ahead of her peers, including highly regarded Alan Ralton. After her father paid her first year fees, Teague self supported herself through the subsequent years of training by winning scholarships.\n\nCareer\n\nArchitectural practice \nWhilst studying at Swinburne she was also articled to her family's firm Purchas & Teague and later joined George E. Nichterlein's office whilst studying at the University of Melbourne. At Nichterlein's, Teague completed several residences and the drawings for St John's Lutheran Church, South Melbourne, which she later reflected on in a short article entitled 'Modernism'.\n\nUpon graduating Teague went to work for F. Keith Cheetham whose portfolio was overtaken by Edward Fielder Billson when Cheetham became ill in 1931. During this time she worked on office detailing, and designing and documenting flats and houses until Roy Grounds suggested that Teague apply for the recently vacated chief draftsperson's position at Oakley & Parkes. She commenced the role in 1934, soon becoming a senior draftsperson and in 1938 was promoted to the chief designer at Oakley & Parkes, where she designed and documented office buildings, flats, houses and factories.\n\nWhen WWII broke out, fellow architect Mary Turner Shaw encouraged Teague to support the war effort by joining the Commonwealth Department of Works (CDW). Initially her role was in munitions designing bomb and shell-filling factories at Maribynong, Victoria and later shifted to designing and documenting pyrotechnics plants in Mulwala, NSW. In 1943 she moved to the Department of Works Post Office section designing and upgrading post offices and telephone exchanges for regional Australian towns as well as the new Brisbane GPO and the Redfern Mail Exchange.  During this time she was also involved in Postwar construction including preliminary design work on the new City of Darwin and Commonwealth offices for Sydney and Melbourne.\n\nAfter working on larger projects Teague joined the team for major projects and was largely responsible for the original designs of the Braddon Flats and an earlier iteration of the National Library, both in Canberra, and the Commonwealth Offices in Melbourne. She later worked on the Lismore and Sydney, Commonwealth Offices, and subsequently remarked that she enjoyed the complexity of office building design.\n\nBy 1959 Teague was promoted to Supervising Architect and became the Superintending Architect in 1960. In the same year she was seconded to a post overseeing work in Delhi, Myanmar and Malaysia with the Department of External Affairs. In 1964, Teague was promoted again into the role of Assistant Director General in the Commonwealth Department of works. From this position she was the first Australian woman elevated to the Second Division of the Public Service. In this role she worked on schools and housing in Darwin, the restoration of Custom's House, Melbourne, and the Springvale Hostel, and several other immigrant hotels, across Victoria.\n\nAdvocacy \nIn 1939, Teague was on Australian Institute of Architect's exhibition committee for an architectural display at the Home and Buildings Exhibition, which she later profiled in an article for the Journal of the Royal Victorian Institute of Architects.\n\nAfter WWII when it was announced that female public servants would be returned to a lower rate of pay (after having parity with the men during the war) Teague and her colleagues strongly advocated against the changes without success.\n\nWriting and teaching \nIn addition to lecturing at the Melbourne Technical College in Architectural Interior Design, from 1948 to 1950 Teague was the Honorary Editor of the RVIA Quarterly Bulletin.\n\nKey works \n St John's Lutheran Church, South Melbourne (1928) \u2013 documentation\n Kodak House, Collins St, Melbourne (1934), Oakley & Parkes \u2013 documentation\n Anzac House, Collins St, Melbourne (1938), Oakley & Parkes \u2013 documentation\n Malcolm Reid's Pty Ltd, Bourke St, Melbourne (1938) \u2013 documentation\n Woolworths, West Melbourne (1938) \u2013 documentation\n Gouge Pty Ltd, Brighton (1938) \u2013 alterations and documentation\n Lane's Motors, Exhibition St, Melbourne (1938) \u2013 design and documentation\n Commonwealth Offices, Spring St, Melbourne (1953), Commonwealth Department of Works \u2013 design\n Commonwealth Offices, Sydney (1953), Commonwealth Department of Works \u2013 design\n\nAwards and honours \n 1930 Grice Bronze Medal from the University of Melbourne's Architectural Atelier\n 1961 Fellow of the Royal Australian Institute of Architects\n 1961 Fellow of the Royal Victorian Institute of Architects\n 1971 Awarded the MBE for her services to the Commonwealth of Australia\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n Cynthia Teague on the Encyclopaedia of Women & Leadership in Twentieth-Century Australia\n Cynthia Teague on Australian Women's History Forum \n Biographical newspaper cuttings collection for Cynthia Teague\n\n1907 births\n2007 deaths\nAustralian women architects\nArchitects from Melbourne\nArchitects in Government\n20th-century Australian architects\nPeople educated at Ruyton Girls' School\nAustralian Members of the Order of the British Empire\n20th-century Australian women\n21st-century Australian women\n21st-century Australian people", "machine_text": "Cynthia Teague, also known as Cindy Teague, is an American entrepreneur and businesswoman who has gained recognition for her work in the technology industry.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Parafovea\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Parafovea or the parafoveal belt is a region in the retina that circumscribes the fovea and is part of the macula lutea. It is circumscribed by the perifovea.\n\nEffect on reading\nIn reading, information within 1\u00b0 (approximately 6\u20138 characters) of the point of fixation is processed in foveal vision, while information up to 6\u00b0 of visual angle benefits from parafoveal preview. Studies have shown that people can tell the difference in the letters of a word in the fovea and near-parafovea (the part of the parafovea closest to the fovea), but not in the outer edges of the parafovea. In languages that read from left to right, the word immediately to the right of the fixated word is known as the parafoveal word. Information present in the parafovea can interact with information present in the fovea. The benefit the parafoveal preview has is also mediated by how common the word in the parafovea is, with less common words providing less of a reduction in fixation duration when they reach foveal fixation. As the clarity of information in the parafovea is not as great as in the fovea, the SWIFT model of eye movements in reading, while allowing for parallel processing, accounts for this difference by assigning the parafoveal less processing power the further away it is from the foveal fixation.\n\nEffect on scene perception\nInformation in the parafovea can influence the processing of a scene. In categorization tasks of natural scenes information from the parafovea can be used to determine the gist of a scene well enough for a categorization judgement, though with reduced sensitivity and speed in comparison to foveal vision. An effect of parafoveal preview has also been found for emotional scenes presented in the parafovea, with people more likely shift their fixation point on emotional stimuli than neutral stimuli, when both options are presented parafoveally.\n\nAdditional images\n\nSee also\n Eye movement in reading\n Eye movement in music reading\n Fixation (visual)\n Optical coherence tomography (OCT)\n\nReferences\n\nHuman eye anatomy\nVisual perception", "machine_text": "Parafovea, a term coined by researcher Kenneth Knoblauch, refers to the region surrounding the fovea in the retina of the human eye. It is also known as the \u201cperifoveal\u201d region, and it is an important part of our visual system. The fovea is the area of the retina that is responsible for our sharpest vision and highest acuity. It contains a high density of photoreceptor cells, the rods and cones, which are specialized in detecting light and color. However, the fovea is a small region and only covers about 1% of the retina. The parafovea, on the other hand, covers the surrounding area, making up about 30% of the retina. The parafovea plays an important role in our visual perception, particularly in tasks that require motion detection, object recognition, and visual search. It contains a dense network of ganglion cells, which are responsible for transmitting visual information to the brain. These cells are sensitive to the shapes, colors, and orientations of objects in the visual field, allowing us to distinguish between different objects and perceive their relative positions. The parafoveal region is also important in the reading process. When we read, our eyes move from one word to the next in a series of quick saccadic movements. These movements are guided by the parafoveal region, which anticipates the next word and helps focus the eyes on it. This allows us to read efficiently and accurately. Studies have found that parafoveal processing is affected by various factors, such as the size, spacing, and position of words, as well as the context in which they appear. Understanding these factors can help researchers develop better models of visual perception and improve our understanding of how the brain processes visual information. In conclusion, the parafovea is an important region of the retina that plays a key role in our visual perception. It is involved in tasks such as motion detection, object recognition, and reading, and its processing is influenced by various factors in the visual environment. Research on the parafoveal region can help us develop a better understanding of how our visual system works and how we perceive the world around us.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 41875449}

It is the operational nerve center of any political organization, where all the important decisions, strategies, and directives are formulated and executed. Function The primary function of a party headquarters is to organize and coordinate the party\u2019s campaign efforts. It is responsible for setting the party\u2019s agenda, promoting its ideology, and recruiting candidates for various electoral offices. The headquarters coordinates with party officials, leaders, and members at all levels of the organization, providing direction for the party's messaging, events, and other organizing efforts. It also creates and implements policies and directs organizational resources to advance the party's goals. Structure The structure of a party headquarters varies depending on the size and ideology of a political party. Usually, there is a hierarchy of officials with a party chairman, general secretary or executive director serving as the head. The headquarters also consists of various departments, including finance, communication, research and analysis, outreach, and legal. Location The location of the party\u2019s headquarters is often strategically chosen to maintain easy access to the media, government offices, and public spaces. Most party headquarters are found in major cities that have high visibility and access to transportation and communications. Importance The party headquarters is a crucial component of any political party. It serves as the central organizing point for all party activities, from recruitment to fundraising, messaging, and media relations. Without a strong headquarters, a political party cannot effectively compete in the political arena.

While an official soundtrack was released at the same time as the film, it only featured a small fraction of the songs used.\n\nScorsese chose the songs for Goodfellas only if they commented on the scene or the characters \"in an oblique way\".

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Herbert Lankester\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Herbert Lankester was an English medical missionary. He led the Church Missionary Society (CMS) for thirty years. His research shifted the role of medical missionaries from agents of religion to agents of health care, leading to the twentieth century model of medical missionaries.\n\nEarly life \nLankester was born in Elm Park Gardens, London, England and lived most of his life in England. It is unknown whether he had any formal education. Though his parents had no medical background, he grew up studying medicine on his own. It is believed that some member(s) of his family became ill, which influenced his interest. In early childhood, his mother battled multiple chronic diseases. Lankester wanted to help his mother get healthy. It is believed that she died while he was in his early teens and that he was brought up by his father. Without any siblings, most of Lankester's time was spent studying medicine.\n\nMissionary call \nLankester served as a leader for the Church Missionary Society examining board in addition to his role as a secretary. He retired in 1926 after serving there for 30 years  During this period, he served as Secretary of the Auxiliary Committee on Medical Missions, Society Physician, Home Secretary and General Secretary. He published numerous papers as the Honorary Secretary of Committee. In Occasional Paper 1, Lankester wrote an Appeal to the Medical Mission Auxiliary Fund Committee. Lankester worked as a researcher. He enjoyed reading and studying why people became ill. He read every book of medicine that was available at the time.\n\nHis work \nLankester was thoroughly involved with researching health care. He was especially interested in seeing how to better supply medicine to those who needed it around the world. As a long time London resident, Lankester focused his work on rural England. According to records, he supplied medical aid to the London countryside. He set up a tent on the side of one of the main roads outside a small village. He treated many different local people as well as people who traveled to seek his help. He had no real way of promoting his medical services beyond word of mouth. He treated people with a range of illnesses including smallpox, yellow fever, cholera, typhoid, polio and diphtheria.\n\nHe started work in England and eventually branched out to other countries. Lankester apparently did not work closely with other medical missionaries, preferring to work independently. His greatest individual medical mission was a three-month stay in the London countryside.\n\nLegacy \nLankester was one of the first and most trusted medical missionaries. Instead of clergymen traveling the countryside, he wanted public perception of medical missionaries to be heroes spreading health and the Gospel. Lankester traveled across London communicating about medical missionaries. He had trouble conveying what medical missionary work was. He is best known for the studying and research he conducted, as well as his supply of medicine and vaccines to those in the near-London countryside.\n\nReferences\n\nSources \n Arumugam, Thiru.

Born in London, Lankester received his medical training at St. Bartholomew's Hospital before moving to Malta, where he worked as a medical officer for the British Army. In 1892, he returned to London and began working at the newly established London School of Tropical Medicine. During his time at the London School of Tropical Medicine, Lankester conducted research on the transmission and prevention of infectious diseases. He was particularly interested in the relationship between sanitation and disease, and was instrumental in developing new standards for public health, including the establishment of clean water and sewage systems. In addition to his work in public health, Lankester was also a prolific writer, publishing numerous papers and articles on bacteriology, parasitology, and public health. His most notable work, The Prevention of Malaria, was published in 1906 and became a standard text in the field. Lankester's contributions to public health were widely recognized during his lifetime. He was awarded numerous honorary degrees and was made a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1920. In 1930, he was appointed president of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. Despite his many achievements, Lankester remained committed to the principles of public service and community health throughout his life.

She made her first on-screen appearance on 18 February 1998. Natalie was originally played by Angelica la Bozzetta until she quit the serial the same year.  Antoinette Byron was then cast in the role and she began appearing from the 1999 season premiere until her departure in 2000.\n\nCharacter creation and casting\nIn 1997, following Debra Lawrance's decision to quit her role as Pippa Ross producers decided to introduce a new family to run the caravan park, because the household was seen as the \"centerpiece of the show\". They created the Nash family consisting of parents Natalie  and Joel Nash, played by la Bozzetta and David Woodley respectively and children Gypsy (Kimberley Cooper) and Tom (Graeme Squires). The family come to Summer Bay from Hong Kong to start a new life.\n\nBozetta quit the role in late 1998 to spend more time with her daughter. Byron was cast in the role and made her debut in the 1999 season premiere.\n\nStorylines\nNatalie returns to Summer Bay in early 1998 with her husband Joel and teenage children Tom (Graeme Squires) and Gypsy (Kimberley Cooper). It is revealed that Joel and Natalie's reason for leaving was seventeen years earlier; Joel's father Jack (John Grant) was Natalie's swimming coach who molested her. She soon builds up a friendship with her brother-in-law Travis (Nic Testoni) and his wife Rebecca (Belinda Emmett).\n\nNatalie, a keen sportswoman and enters a local rowing club but an injury forces her to stop competing. She begins training Tom and disapproves of his rivalry with Vinnie Patterson (Ryan Kwanten), telling him the object of a competition is to do his best, not beat one person. She is more accepting of Gypsy's relationship with Will Smith (Zac Drayson) but takes an instant dislike to Tom's girlfriend Sugar O'Donnell (Brooke Gissing). Natalie then takes the job of P.E. teacher vacated by Joel when he rejoins the police force. During this time, She asks Joel to try for another baby but they discover he has a low sperm count and the idea is abandoned.\n\nThe family's life is at risk when David D'Angelo (Tony Poli), a criminal who Joel had jailed begins a revenge campaign and kidnaps Gypsy. Natalie is also kidnapped but rescued by Joel and Travis. Gypsy is later found by the police and the family are left homeless when David burns the house down. They move in with Travis and Rebecca at the Caravan Park. When Travis and Rebecca leave for Canada, They take over the house and assume responsibility for Justine Welles (Bree Desborough) and Peta Janossi.\n\nWhen Gypsy begins seeing Jesse McGregor (Ben Unwin), a series of misunderstandings lead to many Bay residents, notably Alf and Marilyn Fisher, mistakenly believing that Natalie and Jesse are having an affair. When Natalie finally finds out about the rumours, she finds the idea hilarious. Natalie is then caught up in Jesse's stolen car drama and is asked to look after his daughter, Rachel (Sarah Mumcu) while he goes on the run. Joel is annoyed when he finds out Natalie has contacted Jesse and makes a report to his superiors.\n\nShortly after Natalie visits her mother in Queensland, she discovers she is pregnant. Colleen Smart (Lyn Collingwood) begins spreading rumours that Joel is not the father; which turn out to be true. While in Queensland, Natalie had an affair with an old friend, Glen Tanner (Craig Elliot), who then follows her to the Bay. Although Natalie is not interested in picking things up, Gypsy spots them holding hands in a cafe and jumps to conclusions. Gypsy is later in a car crash, in which her boyfriend Charlie Nicholas (Toby Schmitz) is killed. The Guilt of Natalie's affair gets to her and she confesses all to Joel. They try to salvage the marriage; but they cannot and Natalie leaves for Queensland, taking Rachel with her.\n\nNatalie gives birth to a son, Connor Nash (Connor Smith; McKenzie Roberts) and Joel is angry when he discovers she has given him the surname Nash. Some months later, when Joel has his leg partially crushed during a mudslide, Natalie returns  with Connor. Even though Joel is now involved with Judith Ackroyd (Anna Hruby), Natalie offers to care for him in Queensland during his recovery. Joel refuses and Natalie decides leaving town when Judith drives an unknowing Joel to the house, having realised where his heart really lies. Joel and Natalie reconciled but Natalie felt people in the Bay would have a hard time accepting her and Connor so persuades Joel to go back to Queensland with her. She invites Gypsy but she decides to stay in the Bay, being among the group waving her parents off. Gypsy follows a year later with Will in tow and they marry with the family present.\n\nReception\nChannel 5 chose the episode where Natalie and Joel return to Summer Bay with their children, Tom and Gypsy, as one of their best episodes from the last 25 years of the serial.\n\nReferences\n\nHome and Away characters\nFictional schoolteachers\nTelevision characters introduced in 1998\nFemale characters in television\nFemale villains", "machine_text": "Natalie Nash is an American singer and songwriter known for her soulful and emotive voice.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"ADAPT Act\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Antibiotic Development to Advance Patient Treatment (ADAPT) Act () was introduced in the U.S. Congress on December 12, 2013 by Representative Phil Gingrey of Georgia and fifty-two cosponsors. Responding to the lack of financial incentives for drug manufacturers to innovate new antibiotics and antifungals and the regulatory barriers to their doing so, it proposed an expedited pathway for testing drugs intended for diseases for which no cure yet existed. After it died in committee, a similar version of the Act was re-introduced by Representative John Shimkus of Illinois and his cosponsor Representative Gene Green of Texas. Though this Act likewise failed to make it out of committee, several of its provisions were codified in the 21st Century Cures Act, which was signed into law on December 13, 2016. These include the expedited testing pathway for new antibiotics and a similar provision for antimicrobial susceptibility tests.\n\nBackground\n\nAntibiotic resistance and the barriers to new treatments\nThe cost of antibiotic resistance, in dollars and in lives, motivated the Act\u2019s sponsors and the community stakeholders that supported its passage. In September 2014, the Subcommittee on Health of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce held a hearing at which officials from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Pew Charitable Trusts, and other organizations testified in favor of the ADAPT and 21st Century Cures Acts. Opening the hearing, Subcommittee Chairman Joseph R. Pitts (R-PA) quoted then-Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s recent admonition that failure to \u201cconfront the threat of antibiotic resistance\u201d could \u201ccast [humanity] back into the dark ages.\u201d Speaking at this same hearing, Representative Phil Gingrey (R-GA) (the 2013 Act\u2019s principal sponsor) referenced Centers for Disease Control (CDC) statistics, which placed the number of Americans who die from drug-resistant infections each year at around 23,000. Representative Gingrey asserted that the financial losses from such infections amount to $55 billion annually. Representative John Shimkus (R-IL) would later note these same figures in a House debate over the Acts in July 2015.\n\nEqually worrisome to the ADAPT Act\u2019s proponents were the economic and regulatory impediments to developing new treatments for drug-resistant illnesses. Citing the FDA, Representative Gingrey lamented during the 2014 hearing that \u201cnew antibiotic approval ha[d] decreased by 70 percent since the mid 1980s.\u201d Representative Michael C. Burgess (R-TX) likewise took issue with the \u201clack of a pipeline of new drugs\u201d to respond to the threat of super bugs. Several blamed inadequate market incentives for this paucity of remedies. As Dr. Barbara E. Murray, then-President of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, observed, \u201cAntibiotics are typically priced low [and] used for a short duration.\u201d Pharmaceutical companies can reap greater returns in other areas of research; hence, the development of new antibiotics flounders.\n\nCompounding the scant financial motives for drug development, creators of new treatments were made to contend with \"serious regulatory barriers\". Dr. Murray observed that the small number of patients infected by novel diseases made it difficult for manufacturers to find enough test subjects in order to comply with federal agencies\u2019 n-count requirements. The unavailability of diagnostic tests for these new infectious agents also demanded a large investment to find eligible study participants, while generating little information about drug effectiveness. Stagnant innovation becomes self-perpetuating. The more antibiotics to which a pathogen becomes resistant, the fewer controls there are against which to measure an experimental treatment.\n\nThe GAIN Act\nIn 2012, one of Congress\u2019s earliest attempts at rectifying these barriers to new drug-resistant antibiotics came in the form of the Generating Antibiotics Now (GAIN) Act. GAIN was passed as an amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act. Its strategy for generating new antibiotics is to offer manufacturers an artificial monopoly on any qualifying drugs that they produce. Such drugs must treat illnesses with \u201cthe potential to pose a serious threat to the public health.\u201d However, beyond this blanket criterion, GAIN gave significant deference to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (the Secretary). This latitude was subject only to the requirements that she consider a given pathogen\u2019s \u201cimpact on public health\u201d and \u201cmorbidity and mortality rates\u201d and consult with the CDC, FDA, and the medical community. Manufacturers who satisfied GAIN\u2019s conditions were guaranteed five years of market exclusivity over the pertinent drug. These years could stack with the drug\u2019s \u201cfive year exclusivity as a new chemical entity (NCE), three year clinical investigation exclusivity, and seven-year orphan drug exclusivity.\u201d Moreover, any qualifying drugs were eligible for fast-track review.\n\nGAIN\u2019s value proposition proved to be an effective one. As Representative Frank Pallone (D-NJ) commented during the 2014 ADAPT Act hearing, within two years, GAIN had led to FDA approval of numerous new antibiotics. The expedited review procedure further ensured that these drugs would be \u201cable to combat an imminent infectious disease threat and reach patients at an accelerated pace\". At the same time, Representative Pallone and others were concerned about the consumer harms that these decades of exclusivity might yield. Representative Henry A. Waxman (D-CA) warned that exclusivity \u201callow[s drug companies] to charge higher prices,\u201d which \u201cimposes a significant burden on patients and on the healthcare system overall.\u201d To justify \u201cthe carrot of marketing and regulatory exclusivities,\u201d Representative Pallone exhorted his fellow members of Congress to ensure that their efforts \u201cachieve[] the necessary impact on the pipeline of new drugs.\u201d\n\nProvisions\n\nPurpose and Scope\nThe ADAPT Act complemented GAIN. Representative Gingrey introduced it to the House as the \u201clogical next step to the GAIN Act.\u201d To that end, it did not merely render the development of new treatments more lucrative but more feasible as well. The centerpiece of this proposal was ADAPT\u2019s creation of a Limited Population Antibacterial Drug (LPAD) approval pathway for certain antibiotics. Faced with a disease of sufficient severity for which alternatives do not yet exist, ADAPT would empower the Secretary to dispense with the usual testing requirements and allow manufacturers to go to market based on more limited efficacy tests. As Allan Coukell, Director of Drug, Medical Device, and Food Programs at the Pew Charitable Trusts, observed, a patient with mutli-drug-resistant pneumonia will likely die without access to a new antibiotic. In that case, the uncertainty of an unproven remedy was preferable to the near certainty of death. In conducting such a risk-benefit assessment, ADAPT allowed the FDA to \u201caccept less data\u201d in approving a lifesaving drug. As Representative Shimkus later commended, this \u201cnew, streamlined pathway\u201d saved \u201cthousands of lives\u201d by making experimental drugs available to those who would otherwise have no cure.\n\nGiven the uncertainty inherent in drugs approved via LPAD, ADAPT\u2019s advocates were careful to constrain its reach to \u201chigh-need populations\u201d suffering from the gravest threats. Dr. Janet Woodcock, Director of the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, claimed that ADAPT would be restricted to \u201crare resistant organisms where there are really very few treatment options available.\u201d Within the population of patients affected by these diseases, the Act\u2019s application would be further constrained to \u201cthe limited population in most need of the therapy, as opposed to all patients.\u201d As such, ADAPT would not lower the federal review standard for new drugs, but merely contour it to the needs of \u201ca specific population that is different from the general population.\u201d\n\nRelationship Between the 2013 and 2015 Acts\nThe two versions of the ADAPT Act\u2014H.R. 3742 (2013) and H.R. 2629 (2015)\u2014contain the same three overriding provisions discussed above. Both would amend Section 505 of FD&C (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355) to formally include the expedited testing pathway. Each prescribes certain labeling requirements for manufacturers and charges the Secretary of Health and Human Services with conducting the aforementioned breakpoint review. Under a modification to Title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 247b-22), the Secretary is also to monitor \u201cthe use of antibacterial and antifungal drugs\u201d as well as \u201c[c]hanges in bacterial and fungal resistance to drugs.\u201d This new responsibility of the Secretary encompasses drugs approved both through LPAD as well as the standard procedure. The results of the Secretary\u2019s resistance analysis, like the breakpoint research, are to be made public.\n\nThe 2013 and 2015 Acts differed slightly in scope and the precise process they envisioned. Under the 2013 Act, the Secretary could approve drugs to treat \u201ca limited population of patients for which there is an unmet need,\u201d based on her assessment of either traditional comprehensive studies, \u201cdatasets of limited size,\u201d \u201csuch other confirmatory evidence as [she] deems necessary,\u201d or some combination of the above. The 2015 version expands this list of sources of proof, holding that the Secretary may consult nonclinical tests\u2014assessments not conducted on humans\u2014in deciding on whether to approve a drug.\n\nAt the same time, this later version limited the Act\u2019s applicability via a purpose statement with language evocative of a sliding scale. The Act serves to \u201chelp expedite the development and availability of treatments for serious or life-threatening bacterial or fungal infections,\u201d but this goal depends on \u201cthe severity of the infection and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.\u201d Furthermore, the 2015 Act contained a new precondition. In this version of the legislation, the Secretary did not simply decide what level of proof would be necessary for a drug\u2019s approval but actively collaborated with the manufacturer to create a \u201cwritten agreement\u201d that stipulated the necessary evidence. Only if such an agreement is reached may the Secretary approve the drug via the LPAD pathway. To the end of reaching this agreement, the 2015 Act provides for consultative meetings between manufacturers and the Secretary.\n\nIn regard to labeling, the 2013 Act would have mandated that LPAD drugs bear the warning label noted above: \u201cThis drug is indicated for use in a limited and specific population of patients.\u201d However, on its terms, this requirement applied only to the drug\u2019s \u201cprescribing information\u201d\u2014not necessarily to its packaging or bottle. The 2015 Act broadened the labeling provision. In addition to the warning on prescriptions, this version entailed placing a label on the product itself that states \u201cLimited Population\u201d and features \u201cin a prominent manner . . . adjacent to . . . the brand name of the product.\u201d\n\nFinally, the 2015 version of the Act expanded its applicability relative to the prior version. For one, it allowed the Secretary to expand LPAD to new arenas outside its original superbug context. Should she determine \u201cthat the public health would benefit from expansion of the limited-use pathway,\u201d other medical areas may be subsumed within the Act\u2019s expedited provisions. Secondly, it pulls antimicrobial susceptibility tests into the LPAD pathway. So long as a given test satisfies the exigency conditions for antimicrobial drug treatments, \u201cthe Secretary may authorize the marketing of such device\u201d under LPAD\u2014subject to cautionary labeling requirements.\n\nLimitations\n\nKevin Khachatryan noted, that the ADAPT Act did not impose responsibilities for Antimicrobial stewardship for antibiotics developed under this pathway.\u201d Coupled with the incentive for manufacturers to produce all that they can during their monopoly window, \u201c[t]his can lead to overuse of these antibiotics and contribute to resistant microbes.\u201d Additionally, the Act placed a premium of speed while sidelining other objectives of testing, namely diverse representation among test subjects. This could impede the gathering of data about certain populations respond to experimental drugs, namely \u201cwomen, children, and [the] elderly.\u201d\n\nIncorporation into the 21st Century Cures Act \nThe day Representative Gingrey and fifty-two cosponsors introduced the ADAPT Act, it was referred to the Subcommittee on Health. It never left. A little over a year later, Representative Shimkus, joined by cosponsor Gene Green (D-TX), resuscitated the Act. Again, it died in committee. Nevertheless, \u201c[m]any of [its] provisions were ultimately incorporated into the 21st Century Cures Act [Cures Act].\" A bipartisan effort ranging from such varied policy areas as Medicare savings to tick-borne diseases, the Cures Act was signed into law three years and a day after the ADAPT Act\u2019s initial proposal.\n\nSection 3042 (concerning the \u201cexpedited testing of new antibacterial and antifungal drugs\u201d) of the Cures Act derives nearly verbatim from the 2015 ADAPT Act. At the request of a drug manufacturer, the Secretary may approve a given medication based on substandard data\u2014provided that it \u201cis intended to treat a serious or life-threatening infection in a limited population of patients with unmet needs.\u201d However, in the vein of the 2015 ADAPT Act\u2019s purpose statement, Section 3042 requires the Secretary to balance the benefits of expedited remedies against their costs. Drugs approved under the Cures Act\u2019s LPAD pathway are subject to much the same labeling requirements as under the ADAPT Act. All labeling and advertising associated with such medications \u201cshall contain the statement \u2018Limited Population\u2019 in a prominent manner and adjacent to . . . the proprietary name of such drug.\u201d Section 3044 underscores the Secretary\u2019s ability to update and issue new susceptibility criteria for antimicrobial drugs and her requirement make this information public. Finally, Section 3043 includes similar language (relative to the 2015 ADAPT Act) in regard to the expedited production of new ASTs and their labeling requirements.\n\nReferences\n\nUnited States federal health legislation\nProposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress\nActs of the 114th United States Congress", "machine_text": "The ADAPT (Americans with Disabilities for Attendant Programs Today) Act is a proposed piece of legislation in the United States Congress. The proposed law aims to improve access to home and community-based services for people with disabilities and elderly individuals who require attendant care. The ADAPT Act calls for an expansion of Medicaid provisions by building on the existing \u201cMoney Follows the Person\u201d demonstration project that helped relocate individuals out of institutional care and into community-based settings. The proposed act would help ensure that individuals with disabilities who wish to live independently in their own homes can receive the necessary support and services to do so. According to statistics, about 8.4 million seniors and people with disabilities rely on personal attendant caregivers to help them perform everyday tasks such as bathing, dressing and preparing meals. With increasing demand for home care services amidst a growing aging population in the country, the ADAPT Act aims to further expand the availability of home-based care and services. While there is no timeline for when the act will become law, proponents of the legislation argue that it will help address a critical issue in the healthcare system. Advocates for the ADAPT Act further argue that it will help boost the quality of life of those with disabilities and provide more cost-effective solutions for Medicare and Medicaid. In conclusion, the ADAPT Act has the potential to greatly improve the lives of millions of individuals with disabilities and seniors in the United States, while also providing significant cost savings to the federal government. Time will tell if the act will become law, but its proposal and approval thus far have signaled an important shift towards prioritizing quality home and community-based care.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 46434889}

We're really just two peas in a pod.\" The next face off in 2020 will mark the 100th anniversary since the rivalry started. \n\nIn 2009, the rivalry turned ugly - the two teams faced off against each other in the MIAA championship when a Hope student was instigating fans in the upper concourse late in the 2nd half at VanNoord Arena celebrating what would become a Hope victory, when the Hope student kicked a Calvin students legs and a scuffle occurred.\n\nIn 2015, it again turned ugly as Calvin students stormed the court in a nail-biter victory and Hope players laid in the middle of the floor and refused to move, nearly getting trampled by the court storming.  This caused an incident between the coaches of the two schools as they became elevated, with Coach Mitchell of Hope eventually admitting defeat.\n\nSignificance\nIn 2005, ESPN polled its staff about who they thought were America's greatest college basketball rivalries, and the Calvin\u2013Hope rivalry was voted fourth in all college basketball behind Carolina\u2013Duke rivalry, Connecticut\u2013Tennessee women's basketball rivalry, and Kentucky\u2013Louisville rivalry. ESPN also conducted an on-line \"fan poll\" in which 80% of voters picked the Knights vs. Flying Dutchmen.\n\nThe rivalry between the two colleges is most prominent in basketball; however, the rivalry spans the schools' athletics.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\nCollege basketball rivalries in the United States\nCalvin Knights men's basketball\nHope Flying Dutchmen men's basketball", "machine_text": "Calvin\u2013Hope men's basketball rivalry refers to the longstanding competitive relationship between the men's basketball teams of Calvin College and Hope College, both located in the state of Michigan. The rivalry between Calvin and Hope began in the 1920s and has remained intense ever since. The two colleges are located just 30 miles apart, and their basketball teams regularly compete in the same conference, the Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association (MIAA). The rivalry is particularly intense because both Calvin and Hope have highly successful basketball programs. The Calvin Knights have won 30 MIAA championships and made 27 appearances in the NCAA Division III Men's basketball tournament, while the Hope Flying Dutchmen have won 33 MIAA championships and made 16 appearances in the NCAA Division III Men's basketball tournament. Both programs have also produced numerous professional basketball players over the years. The rivalry between Calvin and Hope has produced many memorable moments over the years. One of the most famous occurred during the 2002-2003 season when Calvin's Joel Scholten hit a last-second shot to give the Knights a 77-76 victory over Hope in the MIAA tournament championship game. The rivalry is also known for its passionate fan base. Both Calvin and Hope draw large crowds to their home games, and the atmosphere at games between the two schools is often described as electric. Overall, the Calvin-Hope men's basketball rivalry is one of the most intense and storied rivalries in all of college basketball. The two schools represent a longstanding tradition of athletic excellence and fierce competition, and their rivalry is sure to continue to captivate fans for years to come.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 8325592}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Fromund Le Brun\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Fromund le Brun (died 1283) was a cleric and judge in  thirteenth century Ireland who became Lord Chancellor of Ireland. He lost a long battle to become Archbishop of Dublin, due  to his notorious pluralism (i.e his holding of multiple benefices). He also clashed bitterly with the Archbishop of Cashel, David Mac Cerbaill.\n\nEarly career\n\nHe may have been a descendant of Sir William le Brun, who came to Ireland during the Norman Invasion of Ireland,  and he  was  probably related to a later William le Brun,  who was also a royal clerk. He is said to have been illegitimate. He is first heard of in 1248 as a clerk to the Justiciar of Ireland, Sir John Fitzgeoffrey, and apparently gained considerable judicial experience in this way: Fitzgeoffrey was a strong and capable viceroy, who reorganised the government of Ulster, and  Le Brun must have learnt a good deal from him. \n\nHis duties  included administrative tasks: his first recorded assignment was to deliver treasure  to the King's Wardrobe  at  Marlborough. He was appointed Lord Chancellor in 1259 and held the office with (possibly) one intermission until his death in 1283. He was a noted pluralist: he was appointed Archdeacon of Waterford, while he also held livings in the dioceses of Dublin, Winchester and Salisbury. He became a papal chaplain in 1259.\n\nFailure to become Archbishop of Dublin\n\nHe was the choice of the monks  of Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin (then called Holy Trinity Priory), to be Archbishop of Dublin in 1271, on the death of Fulk Basset, but he was opposed by  another papal chaplain  and proctor,  William de la Corner, who was the choice of the Chapter of St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin. The matter dragged on for several years, and was in due course referred to the Pope. Le Brun's record of pluralism  destroyed his chances of becoming Archbishop, when it was found that he was unlawfully in possession of one of his benefices.\nPope Nicholas III declared his election void, but also passed over William in favour of a compromise candidate, John de Derlington, who as a royal confessor  also enjoyed the confidence of the English Crown (in the event Derlington, detained by official business in England, died without ever setting foot in Ireland). William de la Corner subsequently became Bishop of Salisbury.\n\nQuarrel with  the Archbishop of Cashel\n\nIn 1275 Le Brun, like the rest of the Dublin administration, became involved in a bitter quarrel with the  formidable Archbishop of Cashel, David Mac Cerbaill (or MacCarwell). The actual issues - the building of a prison in Cashel, followed by a dispute over who should control it- seems trivial enough to modern eyes, but the Archbishop, then as throughout his career, showed himself to be an ambitious, quarrelsome and high-handed man, who in his 35 years in the See of Cashel clashed with almost every  other \nleading Irish figure. He  took grave offence at the suggestion that he should not have exclusive possession of the prison, arguing that Crown control of the gaol was prejudicial to his rights.  He responded to the controversy by excommunicating  his opponents. The outraged Le Brun wrote to Robert Burnell, the Lord Chancellor of England, complaining of the Archbishop's conduct in the strongest terms. The matter dragged on for several years, and the Archbishop was successful in obtaining control of the gaol,  but in 1282 Le Brun was found to be blameless, and in recompense the English Crown  ordered that he receive either a prebend  or some other benefice. He died a few months later.\n\nRoebuck Castle\n\nFromund bought Roebuck Castle, in the south of County Dublin in 1261. It seems that the purchase was a bad bargain for him,  since he was rumoured to be heavily in debt shortly before his death. Roebuck passed to Nigel le Brun, who seems to have been Fromund's nephew. Nigel  and  his wife Amicia also acquired  Knocktopher Castle in  County  Kilkenny. He was living  in  1309. The Le Brun family remained at Roebuck until the late fifteenth century, when it passed by marriage to the first Baron Trimlestown, who married Elizabeth le Brun, daughter of Christopher le Brun, the last male representative of  the family.  It is now part of the campus   of University College Dublin. Fromund also held lands at Tankardstown in County Meath, which he later granted to Theobald Butler.\n\nHe was succeeded as Lord Chancellor by Walter de Fulburn.\n\nReferences\n\nEnglish judges\n13th-century English bishops\n13th-century Irish Roman Catholic priests\nNormans in Ireland\nAnglo-Normans\nLord Chancellors of Ireland\nArchdeacons of Waterford", "machine_text": "Fromund Le Brun was a prominent medieval painter who lived in France during the 12th century. He was recognized for his exceptional skills in the art of fresco painting and was able to create stunning works of art that were admired throughout his lifetime. Unfortunately, much of his work has been lost over time, but his legacy lives on through the impact he had on the art world during his time in history. Little is known about Fromund Le Brun's early life and upbringing. However, it is believed that he was born in the French region of Burgundy in the early 1100s. Fromund's interest in art took him on a journey that would lead him across the country, where he was able to learn from some of the most renowned artists of the time. His travels allowed him to hone his craft and develop a unique style that would be admired for centuries to come. Fromund's most notable works are believed to have been created in the Romanesque style of painting. He painted religious scenes on walls and ceilings of various churches throughout his lifetime. Fromund's frescoes were characterized by their bold colors and distinctive patterns that were intended to evoke a sense of religious reverence in those who viewed them. Today, very few examples of Fromund's work survive. However, one of his most notable pieces is still on display in the Cathedral of Saint-Pierre in Gen\u00e8ve, Switzerland. The painting, which depicts the 'Last Judgment', is a breathtaking display of Fromund's mastery over the art of fresco painting. Although his work is not widely known, Fromund Le Brun remains an important figure in the art world.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Brad Lidge\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Bradley Thomas Lidge (born December 23, 1976) nicknamed \"Lights Out\" is an American former professional baseball pitcher. Lidge played 11 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB), from 2002\u20132012. He played for the Houston Astros, Philadelphia Phillies, and Washington Nationals. As a relief pitcher Lidge saved 225 games during his career. He was a two-time All-Star, and in 2008 won the Delivery Man of the Year Award and the National League (NL) Rolaids Relief Man Award. Lidge is currently a host on SiriusXM's MLB Network Radio.\n\nLidge threw a four-seam fastball that consistently reached 95\u201397 miles per hour, as well as a hard, sharp breaking slider that ranged from 85 to 87\u00a0mph. He also had a cutter of the variation. He sealed the Phillies' 2008 World Series championship with the final out, a strikeout of Eric Hinske in Game 5.\n\nEarly life\nLidge was born in Sacramento, California on December 23, 1976. His family moved to Englewood, Colorado when Lidge was very young. Growing up, Lidge played football, basketball and baseball among other sports. He attended Cherry Creek High School. Lidge initially played outfield but became a pitcher because Cherry Creek's outfield was populated by such draft prospects as Donzell McDonald. He was drafted by the San Francisco Giants in the 42nd round of the 1995 draft but did not sign.\n\nCollege career\nLidge attended the University of Notre Dame, where he played college baseball for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish baseball team. He won the Big East Conference player of the year award during his junior season under coach Paul Mainieri, leading the conference with an 8\u20132 record and 93 strikeouts in  innings.\n\nProfessional career\n\nHouston Astros (2002\u20132007)\n\nEarly career\nLidge was a first round draft pick by the Houston Astros in the 1998 MLB draft, chosen 17th overall as a compensatory pick from the Colorado Rockies, who had signed Darryl Kile in the offseason. Lidge missed parts of his first four professional seasons (at Quad Cities, Kissimmee, Round Rock, and New Orleans) with injuries, including a torn rotator cuff and a broken forearm that threatened his career. He would overcome these injuries, making his MLB debut on April 26, 2002, against the Atlanta Braves, serving as a middle relief pitcher in the Astros' bullpen. He started the only game of his career in September of that year against the Milwaukee Brewers. Lidge went 2-for-2 with a double and 2 RBIs at the plate, but was pulled when he strained an intercostal muscle in his ribcage after pitching three scoreless innings with four strikeouts, two walks and a hit batsman.\n\n2003\u201304\nIn 2003, Lidge was the winning pitcher in the Astros' historic six-pitcher tandem which no-hit the New York Yankees on June 11. That year, Lidge was voted Astros Rookie of the Year by the Houston Chapter of the BBWAA.\n\nFollowing the trades of Billy Wagner in the 2003 off-season and Octavio Dotel in the summer of 2004, the Astros moved Lidge from setup man to closer. He set a new National League record for strikeouts by a reliever with 157, passing Goose Gossage's total of 151 set in 1977. The mark is third all-time for relievers, behind Dick Radatz's 181 in , and Mark Eichhorn's 166 in . In the 2004 season, hitters swung and missed at Lidge's strikes almost 42% of the time; for balls out of the strike zone, batters missed more than 70% of the time.  Baseball writer Joe Posnanski noted, \"I have no doubt that Brad Lidge, that one year, was one of the most unhittable pitchers in the history of baseball.\"\n\n2005\n\nIn his first All-Star Game appearance in 2005, Lidge pitched the bottom of the seventh, striking out all three batters he faced. He threw 11 pitches (2 balls) to Melvin Mora, Mike Sweeney, and Garret Anderson, who did not make contact with any of Lidge's pitches. Lidge became the first pitcher to strike out the side in his first All-Star appearance since Bill Caudill and Dwight Gooden in 1984.\n\nLater in 2005, Lidge finished the season with a 2.29 ERA and a career-high 42 saves. That year, Lidge ranked third in the National League in saves and became the second Houston Astros pitcher ever to record at least 40 saves in one season alongside Billy Wagner.\n\nDuring the 2005 NLCS, Lidge gave up a 3-run home run to Albert Pujols in Game 5 in Houston which forced a Game 6 back in St. Louis, which the Astros would win to clinch their first World Series berth in franchise history. In his very next appearance, Lidge gave up a walk off home run to Scott Podsednik in Game 2 of the 2005 World Series and the series winning run and hit in Game 4 to go 0\u20132 in the series and complete the White Sox sweep of the Astros.\n\n2006\nLidge pitched for the United States national baseball team in the 2006 World Baseball Classic, throwing two scoreless innings. Later that year, Lidge became the third pitcher in Astros history to record 100 saves with the club, after Wagner and Dave Smith, and this led the Astros to sign Lidge to a one-year, $5.35 million contract that would keep him in Houston through the 2007 season.\n\n2007 \nThe Astros avoided contract arbitration with Lidge on January 17, 2007, by signing him to a one-year contract worth $5.35 million. After seeing Lidge struggle in spring training and blow his first save of the season, manager Phil Garner chose to make Dan Wheeler the new Astros closer, while offering Lidge opportunities to relieve in the sixth or seventh innings of games. He regained the closer role at the start of June, but was placed on the disabled list that same month after suffering a strained left oblique muscle. Although Lidge described to reporters that the injury bothered him less towards the end of the day, Garner chose to shut his closer down in order to keep the muscle strain from becoming a larger issue.\n\nAfter returning to the active roster on July 13, Lidge picked up his first save of the season on July 18, against the Washington Nationals. With the July 31 trading deadline approaching, there was speculation that the Astros, who had the third-lowest record in the National League (NL) would trade Lidge, but owner Drayton McLane told reporters, \"I see no reason we should even consider it. He's been one of the best closers in baseball.\" Instead, the club traded Wheeler to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in exchange for infielder Ty Wigginton. Despite his early-season struggles and injuries, Lidge finished the 2007 season 5\u20133 with 19 saves in 27 opportunities. He also held his opponents to a .218 batting average and record and average of 11.8 strikeouts per nine innings pitched (K/9). After the season, Lidge underwent surgery to repair a cartilage tear in his right knee, with the anticipation that he would be healthy for the beginning of spring training.\n\nPhiladelphia Phillies (2008\u20132011)\n\n2008\n\nIn February 2008, Lidge tore the meniscus in his right knee while pitching off the mound during Spring training. To exacerbate matters, this was the same knee that he had had surgery on during the off-season. Later in the month, he had successful arthroscopic surgery on his right knee to repair the torn meniscus. As a result, Lidge sat out until April 5 to start the season.\n\nDuring the early 2008 season, Lidge showed signs that he regained the dominant form he displayed in his earlier career. In the opening two months of the season, he converted 12 save opportunities and allowed just two earned runs. In May, Lidge returned to Minute Maid Park, where he was greeted by a mixed reaction from Astros fans, but he recorded his 12th save of the season against his former team. He opened the month of June, usually the start of the summer's heavy-hitting season, with three saves earned in three straight games versus the Florida Marlins and the Cincinnati Reds.\n\nIn July 2008, Lidge signed a 3-year contract extension with the Phillies. Lidge also set new Phillies records by converting his first 19 save opportunities and 35 straight saves.\n\nLidge was named to the roster of the 2008 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. He was announced before the game as the closer. After warming up six separate times, he ended up the final pitcher available in the game, and pitched in the 15th inning. He allowed a game-winning sacrifice fly in the bottom half of the inning, as the American League won the game, 4\u20133.  \n \nOn September 27, 2008, Lidge became the first closer in Phillies history to be perfect in regular season saves, converting 41 in as many opportunities, as he secured the National League East division title for the Phillies.  He is the first closer since \u00c9ric Gagn\u00e9 in 2003 to have a perfect conversion rate and 30+ saves. Lidge finished the 2008 season with 41 out of 41 save opportunities, a 1.95 ERA, and 92 strikeouts in 62 games.\n\nHe saved the decisive Game 5 of the 2008 World Series in Philadelphia on October 29, 2008 over the Tampa Bay Rays with a strikeout, to make him 7 for 7 in postseason saves, thus completing his perfect season (a record he shares with John Wetteland, Troy Percival, Koji Uehara, Zach Britton and Greg Holland; Robb Nen was also 7 for 7 in 2002 before he blew one on the 8th opportunity).\n\nLidge was eighth in the voting for the 2008 NL MVP award, behind Albert Pujols, Ryan Howard, Ryan Braun, Manny Ramirez, Lance Berkman, CC Sabathia, and David Wright, and was the only player other than Pujols or Howard to receive first place votes.\n\nHe received the MLB Comeback Player of the Year Award and Delivery Man of the Year Award. Baseball fans nationwide voted him the MLB \"This Year in Baseball Awards\" Closer of the Year. Lidge was voted the Philadelphia Sports Writers Association's Outstanding Pro Athlete of the Year award and honored at their annual dinner on January 26, 2009. He was named the inaugural recipient of the Daily News Sportsperson of the Year award.\n\nLidge gave twelve customized Rolex Submariners to the members of the Phillies bullpen to commemorate his perfect season.\n\n2009\nLidge's 2009 season was a complete reversal of fortune from the prior year, in which he was perfect in save opportunities. Through the month of June, Lidge had an ERA of 7.57 in  innings pitched, while he converted only 14 of 20 save opportunities. Lidge missed most of June due to injury, as he was placed on the disabled list due to a sprained right knee.\n\nAfter returning to the Phillies, Lidge's performance did not improve and he continued to blow leads and save opportunities, but Phillies manager Charlie Manuel continued to support Lidge and reiterate that he was the team's closer. By September, though, Lidge had struggled long enough that Manuel began using other relievers to close games. Lidge was used in different situations out of the bullpen, but did not find a role where he pitched consistently well. Lidge finished the season with a win-loss record of 0\u20138, an ERA of 7.21, and 31 saves in 42 opportunities, and he allowed an average of 1.81 walks plus hits per inning pitched. For closers with at least 20 saves in a season, Lidge's 2009 ERA is the worst in MLB history. Lidge's best month of the season was July, when his ERA was 5.91, and his best save streak stretched only 8 consecutive saves.\n\nIn the National League Division Series against the Colorado Rockies, Lidge appeared in Games 3 and 4 in save situations, earning the save in both games. In Game 1 of the 2009 National League Championship Series, Lidge secured his 3rd save helping the Phillies win 8\u20136.  In Game 4 of the series, Lidge pitched in relief of Scott Eyre to retire the last two batters with the Phillies trailing 4\u20133 in the ninth inning.  He eventually got his first win of 2009 after Jimmy Rollins hit a game-winning double to give the Phillies a 5\u20134 victory.  Entering the 2009 World Series, Lidge and the New York Yankees' Mariano Rivera were the only closers who had not blown a save during the 2009 postseason. In Game 4 which would be Lidge's only appearance in that World Series, he gave up three runs in the ninth inning, giving the Yankees a 7\u20134 win and a 3\u20131 lead in the series.  The Yankees went on to win the series in six games.\n\n2010\nLidge underwent elbow surgery in January 2010, and he pitched in rehabilitation games with the Phillies' minor league teams (Clearwater, Reading, & Lehigh Valley) during the beginning of the 2010 season. He made his first major league appearance of the season on April 30 against the New York Mets, surrendering a home run to the first batter he faced and recording one out before being removed from the game.  On June 22, 2010, Lidge recorded his 200th save against the Cleveland Indians.\n\nAfter spending most of the first half on the disabled list, Lidge rebounded from the previous season. He converted 17 of his last 18 save opportunities during the regular season and recorded two saves during a 2010 postseason in which he did not allow a run. Lidge finished 2010 with a 2.96 ERA and 27 saves in 32 opportunities.\n\n2011 \nAfter entering spring training fully healthy, Lidge was shut down on March 25 with pain in the back of his right shoulder, which he said was a new occurrence. An MRI revealed a posterior rotator cuff strain that did not require surgery, but would take three to six weeks to heal, and he began the 2011 MLB season on the disabled list. He underwent an eight-game rehab assignment with Lakewood and Reading, going 0\u20130 with a 3.52 ERA and 10 strikeouts in 7.2 innings before returning to the Phillies roster on July 22. Although his pitch velocity remained constant during Lidge's rehab appearances, with his fastball hovering around , Lidge and sports journalists alike voiced concerns over the pitcher's control: in one appearance for Reading, he threw only 15 strikes in 28 pitches.\n\nLidge did not return to the closer role even after coming off of the disabled list; instead, his setup man Ryan Madson filled the ninth inning, while Lidge found himself in competition with Antonio Bastardo over who would pitch the eighth. Despite seeing a decreased velocity on his fastball, Lidge found success in later innings with his slider, working up to an 11.29 K/9 by the end of September. Lidge's strong relationship with Madson helped both players adjust to their new positions. Lidge told reporters during the 2011 NLCS that, while Madson was closing, he would find himself \"shaking pitches off with [Madson]. I feel that I am there with him.\" Lidge played in 25 games during the 2011 season, during which he posted a 0\u20132 record with a 1.40 ERA and struck out 23 batters in  innings.\n\nWashington Nationals (2012) \n\nOn January 26, 2012, the Washington Nationals signed Lidge to a one-year, $1 million contract, plus additional incentives. He had not been signed as a closer for Washington, but after Drew Storen suffered from elbow inflammation during spring training, the team prepared to use Lidge and Henry Rodr\u00edguez in the ninth inning. The pair officially took over for Storen when the latter underwent surgery for a bone chip in his elbow. After allowing four earned runs in seven innings and blowing two saves, Lidge was placed on the disabled list with an abdominal wall strain. He was diagnosed with a sports hernia and underwent surgery on May 1, with an estimated recovery time of three weeks before he could begin throwing again. After pitching a perfect inning in a rehab assignment for the Class A-Advanced Potomac Nationals, Lidge was able to rejoin the Washington active roster on June 7, a week earlier than expected; he effectively replaced Rodr\u00edguez, who was placed on the disabled list with a strained finger. He was unable to perform with the Nationals, going 0\u20131 with two saves and a 9.64 ERA in 11 bullpen appearances, with opposing hitters batting .308 against him. The Nationals designated Lidge for assignment on June 17 after two poor outings against the New York Yankees, and Ryan Mattheus was activated in his place. He was released from his contract shortly after, and returned home to Colorado in order to spend time with his family and consider whether or not he would pursue another contract.\n\nRetirement \nAfter being released from the Nationals, Lidge took the remainder of the summer to decide whether he wanted to continue his pitching career. On December 2, 2012, he announced his intentions to retire from baseball. At the time of his retirement, Lidge had 225 regular-season career saves, as well as 18 postseason saves. He also struck out 799 batters in  regular-season innings for a career 11.919 K/9, the second-best ratio of any pitcher with more than 500 innings. Lidge signed a ceremonial one-day contract with the Phillies on August 1, 2013, enabling him to officially retire as a member of the organization.\n\nPersonal life\nLidge currently resides in Englewood, Colorado, with his wife, Lindsay, and their two children, daughter Avery Grace and son Rowan Thomas. He has an interest in archaeology and religious studies and takes online courses at Regis University. Lidge's cousin, Ryan Lidge, is currently a catcher in the New York Yankees organization.\n\nSee also\n\n Houston Astros award winners and league leaders\n List of Houston Astros no-hitters\n List of Major League Baseball career saves leaders\n List of Major League Baseball no-hitters\n List of Major League Baseball single-inning strikeout leaders\n List of Philadelphia Phillies award winners and league leaders\n List of University of Notre Dame athletes\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\n\n1976 births\nLiving people\nBaseball players from Sacramento, California\nClearwater Threshers players\nCorpus Christi Hooks players\nHouston Astros players\nKissimmee Cobras players\nLakewood BlueClaws players\nLehigh Valley IronPigs players\nMajor League Baseball pitchers\nNational League All-Stars\nNew Orleans Zephyrs players\nNotre Dame Fighting Irish baseball players\nPotomac Nationals players\nPhiladelphia Phillies players\nQuad Cities River Bandits players\nReading Phillies players\nRound Rock Express players\nWashington Nationals players\nWorld Baseball Classic players of the United States\n2006 World Baseball Classic players", "machine_text": "Brad Lidge (born December 23, 1976) is a former American baseball relief pitcher who played for 11 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB).

This was the first election held in Lithuania under the democratic 1922 Constitution, adopted by the Constituent Assembly of Lithuania on 1 August 1922.\n\n38 out of 78 seats were won by a bloc of parties led by the Christian Democrats, and they acquired both the positions of President and Prime Minister, occupied by Aleksandras Stulginskis and Ernestas Galvanauskas respectively. In both cases, however, the Christian Democrats were not supported by any party in the opposition and could only form a minority government. Unable to work with such a makeup, the First Seimas was dissolved on 12 March 1923.\n\nElectoral system\nThe law on the conduct of Seimas elections was promulgated by the Constituent Assembly on 19 July 1922, and published in the official newspaper of the government, \"Vyriausyb\u0117s \u017einios\" (Government News) on 27 July 1922. Elections were universal, free and secret, and all citizens of Lithuania, both men and women over 21 years old, were allowed to vote. Citizens 24 years old or older were allowed to stand for election.\n\nThe elections were held with party-list proportional representation, in nine multi-member constituencies. In practice, only six of the nine defined constituencies held elections, as Constituencies VII, VIII and IX were allocated to territories occupied by Poland during the Polish\u2013Lithuanian War in 1920. Their centers were Vilnius, Lida and Hrodna respectively.\n\nParties and electoral groups (kuopa) were allowed to submit lists of candidates to constituencies, which had to be signed by at least fifty voters. As such, there was a large number of small electoral lists in every constituency. However, the method of calculating the distribution of seats in each constituency benefited larger parties, as such, the only non-party electoral group which managed to gain seats were lists submitted by the underground Communist Party of Lithuania.\n\nCompeting parties\nThe largest and most active electoral alliance in the election was the Christian Democratic Bloc, formed from the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party and two satellite organizations - Labour Federation, which represented Catholic workers, and Farmers' Association, which represented Catholic peasantry. The Christian Democratic Bloc was strongly supported by the Lithuanian priesthood, which had a strong influence in the agrarian and less literate countryside, and numerous priests were a part of their electoral lists.\n\nHowever, the Christian Democrats were isolated in the political arena. Historically, LKDP evolved from a different stream of the Lithuanian National Revival than all of their competitors - the Peasant Union, Social Democrats and Party of National Progress (later the Lithuanian Nationalist Union). All of them evolved from the secular nationalist newspaper Varpas, while the Christian Democrats evolved around the Catholic periodical T\u0117vyn\u0117s sargas.\n\nThe alliance of the Peasant Union and Popular Socialist Party presented itself as socialist and campaigned for the lifting of martial law and secularization. Though the main targets of the criticism were Christian Democrats and National Progress, they were also in opposition to the Social Democrats. The Social Democrats presented their electoral campaign as the first step towards a peaceful socialist revolution and campaigned for a \"Seimas of the workers\". All political parties supported the land reforms put in place by the Constituent Assembly, and oftentimes argued that their competitors will be the ones to roll back the reform.\n\nSeparate electoral lists by the Polish, Jewish and Russian minorities also competed in the election.\n\nResults\n\nAftermath\nThough the Christian Democratic Bloc achieved a plurality of the seats, they were unable to form a majority coalition, nor did the opposition parties manage to unite against them. The next President and Prime Minister were thus elected via violations of electoral conduct. Protesting against the Christian Democrats, the opposition parties refused to participate in the election of Aleksandras Stulginskis and he was elected solely with Christian Democratic votes. Two governments led by independent politician Ernestas Galvanauskas were formed, but in both cases they were approved with 38 votes in favor and 38 votes against (2 members of the Seimas did not participate), which the opposition criticized as illegal.\n\nThe formed government was unstable and the First Seimas was dissolved on 12 March 1923.\n\nReferences\n\n \n\nLithuanian parliamentary election\nParliamentary election\nLithuanian parliamentary election\nParliamentary elections in Lithuania", "machine_text": "The 1922 Lithuanian parliamentary election took place on May 12-14, 1922, and was the second parliamentary election to be held in Lithuania after it gained independence from Russia in 1918. The election was held under the newly adopted Constitution of Lithuania and was the first to use a proportional representation system. The election saw a total of 1,029,998 registered voters, out of which 68.8% voted. A total of 15 parties participated, and six of them secured representation in the Seimas, the Lithuanian parliament. The Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party (LKDP) emerged as the largest party, winning 26.8% of the vote and securing 31 out of the 85 seats in the Seimas. The Social Democrats came in second with 18.8% of the votes and 20 seats, while the Lithuanian Popular Peasants' Union (LTS) came in third with 15.7% of the votes and 15 seats. Other parties that secured representation in the Seimas included the Lithuanian National Union (TNL), the Lithuanian Democratic Party (LDP), and the Jewish List. The TNL won 9.3% of the votes and secured nine seats, the LDP won 9.2% of the votes and secured eight seats, while the Jewish List won 5.2% of the votes and secured six seats.

Multiprotocol encapsulation allows two different protocols to communicate with each other by encapsulating the data, allowing it to be transmitted over a network that would not otherwise be able to understand the protocol. Multiprotocol encapsulation operates on the transport layer of the OSI model and involves encapsulating one protocol inside another. This enables data to be transmitted through routers and other network devices that may not support the original protocol. The two most commonly used protocols for encapsulation are IP (Internet Protocol) and GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation). IP is used as the outer protocol, while GRE is used as the inner protocol. Other protocols that can be encapsulated include Ethernet, MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching), and PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol). Multiprotocol encapsulation offers numerous benefits to network administrators. One of the most significant benefits is that it allows different networks to communicate with each other, even if they use different protocols. This eliminates the need for multiple networks and reduces complexity, making it easier for administrators to manage and maintain their networks. Multiprotocol encapsulation also improves network performance, as it allows data to be transmitted more efficiently by reducing the number of protocol translations and network hops. Multiprotocol encapsulation is widely used in today\u2019s networks, particularly in large enterprise networks and service provider networks. It is also commonly used in virtual private networks (VPNs) to securely transmit data over the internet. Multiprotocol encapsulation has become an essential technology for modern networking, as it enables communication between different protocols and networks to facilitate connectivity and data transfer.

After that, he went on to win several more races, including the Claret Stakes and the Royal Plates, which were some of the most prestigious races of the time. In 1711, he won a four-mile match race against another famous thoroughbred, called Diamond. Basto was known for his incredible endurance and speed, which allowed him to win races of varying distances. He was also a very versatile runner, winning races on both dirt and turf surfaces. His achievements in horse racing made him one of the most famous horses of his time, and a legend in the sport. After retiring from racing, Basto became a successful sire of thoroughbred horses, passing on his exceptional racing abilities to his offspring. He died in 1725 at the age of 22. Today, Basto is remembered as one of the greatest horses in the history of horse racing. His achievements on the track and his legacy as a sire have earned him a place in the annals of racing history. His legacy can still be seen in the pedigrees of many modern-day thoroughbred horses, proving that his greatness has stood the test of time.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 39275647}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Sitok Srengenge\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Sitok Srengenge (born 22 August 1965) is an Indonesian poet, actor, and dramatist. Born Sitok Sunarto in Purwodadi, Central Java, he became interested in literature at a young age and was heavily influenced by his village's strong oral tradition. When he moved to Jakarta to complete his university studies, he became involved with the Bengkel Teater under Rendra. Sitok remained with the company for almost a decade, appearing in several plays as he refined his literary style. His first poetry collection, Persetubuhan Liar, was published in 1992.\n\nSitok has since published multiple poetry collections, including a bilingual work titled On Nothing and a trilogy of revised editions known collectively as Tripitakata, as well as a novel and serial. He has presented his poetry in such countries as the Netherlands and Germany, and participated in writers workshops in Hong Kong and Iowa. His poems, noted for their \"laconic, muscular, and musical\" poetic phrase, have been adapted to music in a variety of genres. In 1999, Asiaweek described Sitok as \"Indonesia's best young poet\".\n\nBiography\n\nEarly life\nSitok Srengenge was born Sitok Sunarto in Dorolegi, Purwodadi, Central Java, on 22 August 1965. Though the villagers did not support their children attending school, and elders would chase prospective students away, they maintained a strong oral tradition that Sitok credits with influencing the sonic qualities of his poetry. As a youth he was active in theatre, and by junior high school he had begun to write poetry. In a 2004 interview, he stated \"All I knew was that writing those words that lingered in my head made me happy\".\n\nDespite the resistance against education, Sitok obtained a scholarship which allowed him to complete his elementary and secondary school studies in the provincial capital of Semarang. He graduated from Senior High School 1, Semarang, in 1985.\n\nTheatre and first collection\nIn 1985, Sitok moved to Indonesia's capital, Jakarta, to study at the Faculty of Art and Literature of the Jakarta Teacher Training Institute. There he became involved with Bengkel Teater under the poet-cum-dramatist Rendra, who gave him the name Sitok Srengenge, which translates from Javanese as \"the only sun\". In his ten years with Bengkel Teater, Sitok practiced poetry, monologues, and acting, and appeared in several of the troupe's plays.\n\nSitok published his first poetry collection, Persetubuhan Liar, in 1992. Funded by the singer-songwriter Iwan Fals, this collection was intended as a counterpoint to the rise in religious literature which had become popular in Indonesia in the early 1990s.\n\nIn the mid-1990s Sitok became an independent artist, acting under directors such as Ikranegara (Jam Berapa Sekarang) and Ratna Sarumpaet (Pesta Terakhir); he has remained active into the 2010s, portraying the Mahabharata warrior Karna in a 2011 play by Goenawan Mohamad. He also established his own theater troupe, Teater Matahari, as well as the Keranjang Sampah Kebudayaan (\"Cultural Wastebin\") discussion forum.\n\nShort stories by Sitok were included in the short story anthology Para Pembohong (The Liars) in 1996. Publication of the anthology was supported by Sitok's organization Gorong-Gorong Budaya, meant to encourage and support pro-democracy artists. Sitok was a founding member and one of the directors of the Utan Kayu Arts Community Center, serving as the director of its literary biennale and editor of its journal Kalam during the 1990s and 2000s. Beginning in 2007, he served as a curator for the Salihara cultural center until his resignation in 2013.\n\nAs a student, Sitok was involved in pro-democracy rallies against President Suharto. In the lead-up to Suharto's 1998 resignation, he would often attend underground rallies and discussions, reciting verses of poetry. None of these works had been anthologized by 2006. Sitok was one of the participants in the 1995 Istiqlal International Poetry Reading conference, which focused predominantly on Islamic poetry, and several of his poems were included in its publication The Poet's Chant. Bulgarian translations of his works were published in Chants of Nusantara that year.\n\nSubsequent collections\nIn 1999, Asiaweek wrote that Sitok \"is considered Indonesia's best young poet [and] often thought ... as contributing to the 'reawakening' of Indonesian literature\". The magazine selected him as \"one of twenty leaders for the Millennium in society and culture in Asia\". The translator and Indonesianist Harry Aveling, in his 2001 anthology Secrets Need Words, described Sitok as a \"pioneer\" leading poets out of \"the fear that froze the poets of the eighties\".\n\nIn 2000, Sitok published Anak Jadah (Bastard), a collection of poems described by Yenni Kwok of the Sunday Morning Post as \"a statement about the confusion of his generation\". Explaining the title, Sitok stated that \"Tradition and modernisation met in a careless encounter\" producing \"a generation of cultural bastards\". A second poetry collection, Nonsens, was published later that year by the Kalam Foundation in collaboration with the Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies, Ford Foundation, and Adikarya IKAPI Foundation. The collection contained thirty-five works, as well as several illustrations by Agus Suwage.\n\nSitok published his debut novel, Menggarami Burung Terbang (Salting a Flying Bird), in 2004. The work follows a group of common villagers (the Javanese wong cilik) in the period following the coup attempt of 1965. Pamela Allen, writing in Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde, found the novel to have a \"rich, dense blend of realist prose in Indonesian, Javanese mythology and Javanese language\", making it unprecedented in works of Indonesian literature which deal with the subject matter. She argued that Sitok used local colour (warna lokal) not as a simple backdrop to a nationalist discourse, but rather to grant \"real insight into local ways of thinking and interpreting the world\".\n\nSitok released a bilingual volume of his poetry, On Nothing, at the Ubud Writers and Readers Festival. The poems in this second collection ranged from \"gentle and romantic\" to \"drenched in erotic images and metaphors\". The edition, published by Sitok's own publishing house Kata Kita, contains Indonesian and English versions of poems from his first four poetry collections, translated by four writers: Nukila Amal, Hasif Amini, Margaret Glade-Agusta, and Lauren Bain. of The Jakarta Post found \"both structured and unstructured poetry\" and \"themes connected to the human condition, such as love, motherhood, childbirth and racism\" in the collection.\n\nA trilogy of poetry collections, titled Tripitakata, was released in 2013. Its first volume, Gembala Waktu dan Madah Pereda Rindu, contained poems written by Sitok while still in senior high school and university, up through 1989.  The second volume, Kelenjar Bekisar Jantan dan Stanza Hijau Muda, was expanded on the previous collections Persetubuhan Liar and Kelenjar Bekisar Jantan with poems written between 1986 and 1991. The third, Anak Badai dan Amsal Puisi Banal, contained the poems of Anak Jadah as well as other poems written between 1986 and 1991. In August 2015, Sitok released another poetry collection, Ereignis dan Cinta yang Keras Kepala, which contained fifty poems written between 2010 and 2014.\n\nSitok has attended several writers workshops, including at the University of Iowa (2001) and Hong Kong Baptist University (2005). He has read his poems at the Indische Festival in the Hague, the Winternachten Festival in the Hague, the University of Leiden, and the University of Hamburg.\n\nStyle\nIn a 1999 interview with Asiaweek, Sitok compared writing to boxing, with essays and other prose as shadowboxing and poetry as \"real\" boxing. When reciting his poetry, he prefers rote memorization over reading published or written editions\u00a0\u2013 something unusual among Indonesian poets. Sirikit Syah of The Jakarta Post describes him as having \"a powerful voice and impressive stage rhythm\" and of being \"a master of lexicon\". Krassin Himmirsky, who translated several of Sitok's poems into Bulgarian, found his \"poetic phrase ... laconic, muscular, and musical\", with a universal message.\n\nRegarding the writing process, Sitok has stated that \"There are poems within me. They are just there.\" He composes his poetry in his mind, and is reluctant to write them unless they are completed. He may produce as few as two poems a year.\nHe says that, although he may occasionally be influenced by politics, he tries to separate civic involvement and writing.\n\nImpact and critical reception\n\nSitok's work has been adapted to various media. In 2011, Dian HP produced Delapan Komposisi Cinta (Eight Compositions of Love), a concert for Ubiet Raseuki, using lyrics taken directly from the poems of Sitok and Nirwan Dewanto. In 2012 she released Semesta Cinta, an album of art songs based on Sitok's poetry. The Australian writer Jan Cornall released a jazz album, Singing Srengenge, based on the poet's work; Sitok's works have also been adapted by Denise Jannah and David Kotlowy.\n\nSitok's poetry has been compared to the work of numerous other poets, both Indonesian and non-Indonesian, including Pablo Neruda, Chairil Anwar, Iwan Simatupang, and Sitor Situmorang. Cornall describes Srengenge's work as \"deeply spiritual in the true sense of the word ... where the sensuality of longing, the beauty of sorrow, and the wisdom of deeply felt observation becomes the language of the soul\". Himmirsky finds Sitok's poems to include \"the true values of life, its pulsating dynamism and wisdom. ... [Readers] are deeply moved by his affection for his beloved, for his parents, for the human race.\" The translator John McGlynn writes that Sitok \"explores topics with a depth and maturity not only rare among his peers, but also with a vocabulary and clarity that few other poets can match\".\n\nPersonal life\nSitok is married to Farah Maulida. The couple have a daughter, Laire Siwi Mentari. She is a novelist, publishing her debut work Nothing but Love in 2004; by 2009 it had sold more than 40,000 copies. She has published a further novel, Aphrodite, and in 2009 was working on a short story collection.\n\nThe family lives in Bantul, Yogyakarta. Their home, construction of which began in 2006, sits on  of land and holds six buildings: the main house, a joglo style pavilion, a public library, private office, communal kitchen, and guest house. The open plan house itself is an \"eclectic\" design, \"fus[ing] ethnic and art deco styles\" and incorporating antique building materials from throughout Java. The landscaping itself maintains natural surroundings, avoiding artificial gardens.\n\nBibliography\n\nPoetry collections\n\nPersetubuhan Liar (1992)\nKelenjar Bekisar Jantan (2000?)\nAnak Jadah (2000)\nNonsens (2000)\nOn Nothing (2005)\nGembala Waktu dan Madah Pereda Rindu (2013)\nKelenjar Bekisar Jantan dan Stanza Hijau Muda (2013)\nAnak Badai dan Amsal Puisi Banal (2013)\nEreignis dan Cinta yang Keras Kepala (2015)\n\nProse\n\nMenggarami Burung Terbang  (novel; 2004)\nTrilogi Kutil (1984)\nCinta di Negeri Seribu Satu Tiran Kecil (essay collection; 2012)\n\nExplanatory notes\n\nReferences\n\nWorks cited\n\n1965 births\n20th-century Indonesian poets\nLiving people\nIndonesian essayists\nIndonesian novelists\nIndonesian actors\nPeople from Central Java\n21st-century Indonesian poets\nIndonesian male poets\n20th-century essayists\n21st-century essayists\n20th-century male writers\n21st-century male writers\nJakarta State University alumni", "machine_text": "Sitok Srengenge is a renowned Indonesian poet and literary critic.

A coachbuilder by trade, he was active in the local militia, before becoming a professional soldier in 1899. Commander of the First New Zealand contingent that fought in South Africa during the Second Boer War, Robin later served as General Officer Commanding New Zealand Military Forces from 1914 to 1919. For his service during the First World War he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George, and was one of only 14 members of the New Zealand Military Forces to receive the French Legion of Honour decoration during the war.\n\nEarly life\nAlfred William Robin was born on 12 August 1860 in Riddells Creek, Victoria, in Australia, to a baker and his wife. His family immigrated to New Zealand sometime in 1861 and settled in Dunedin, in the South Island, where his father set up a coach building business. In 1873, after completing a year of high school, Robin started working for his father and eventually became a partner in the business.\n\nMilitary career\nRobin had a keen interest in the military; while at school he participated in the cadet program and in 1878 joined the New Zealand Regiment of Volunteer Artillery. He later served with the Southland Hussars and the Dunedin Cavalry Volunteers, and rose to the rank of sergeant major. In 1886, the Dunedin Cavalry Volunteers became the Otago Hussars and three years later he was commissioned as a lieutenant. He was promoted to captain in 1891 and took over command of his unit. He was a highly regarded officer and his unit was one of the most efficient in the Volunteer Corps. In 1897, he was selected to lead the New Zealand contingent to Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. His last command in the Volunteer Corps was as a commander of a newly formed mounted rifle battalion.\n\nIn 1899, Robin joined the New Zealand Permanent Forces as a professional soldier. He had resigned his partnership in the family business the previous year. His first posting was as an instructor to the South Island mounted rifle units and he established a tactical training school for officers. Following the outbreak of the Second Boer War, he led the first contingent of New Zealand volunteers, which numbered 215 men and their horses, to South Africa in November 1899. Further contingents would follow. While there he commanded the 1st New Zealand Regiment, which was a combined formation of the first three contingents from New Zealand. Well regarded by the British officers that he served under in South Africa, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath and mentioned in dispatches three times and on his return to New Zealand in May 1901 he became a national celebrity.\n\nRobin was promoted to colonel and appointed commander of the Otago Military District and in 1906 he became Chief of General Staff of the New Zealand Permanent Forces (soon to be reorganised as the New Zealand Military Forces) and a member of the newly formed Council of Defence. The council recognised the need to implement compulsory military training to improve the state of New Zealand's armed forces and Robin worked to achieve this. In 1910, following the dissolution of the Council of Defence, Robin became Adjutant and Quarter-master General. In this role he worked under Major General Alexander Godley, newly appointed as Commandant of the New Zealand Military Forces. In 1912 he served overseas as New Zealand's representative in the War Office in London on the Imperial General Staff. He was also appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George the same year.\n\nFirst World War\nReturning to New Zealand in 1913, Robin resumed duties as Quarter-master General. Following the outbreak of the First World War, he played a key role in preparing the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) for service overseas. An offer to serve overseas was rebuffed as the New Zealand Government felt he was better employed on the home front. While Godley commanded the NZEF in the Middle East and France, Robin took over his duties as Commandant of the New Zealand Military Forces. He worked to ensure that the NZEF were well maintained with reinforcements and supplies, and his work in this regard was recognised by Godley who recommended that Robin be appropriately rewarded. Promoted to brigadier general in 1915, the following year he was promoted to major general and appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George. His service as commandant ended in late 1919.\n\nIn recognition of his wartime service, Robin was appointed a Chevalier of the L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur by the French President in March 1922. This French award is uncommon to New Zealanders with fewer than 100 awards made, and Robin was one of only 14 members of the New Zealand Military Forces to be decorated with the Legion of Honour during the war.\n\nLater life\nRobin served as the acting administrator of Western Samoa from 1920 to 1921, retiring from the military in January 1921. In his retirement he supported a number of charitable organisations including the Boy Scouts' Association and the St John Ambulance Brigade; shortly before his death he was made a Knight of Justice of the Order of St John. A memorial shield named for Robin is awarded each year to the winning cadet team at the annual New Zealand St John Youth competition. He was president of First New Zealand Mounted Rifles' Association and was also involved with the South African War Veterans' Association of New Zealand. He died in Wellington in June 1935. Having never married, he had no children. He declined a military funeral and is buried in Wellington's Karori Cemetery.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\n \n\n1860 births\n1935 deaths\nAustralian emigrants to New Zealand\nChevaliers of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur\nNew Zealand Companions of the Order of the Bath\nNew Zealand Knights Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George\nNew Zealand commanders\nNew Zealand generals\nNew Zealand military personnel of the Second Boer War\nNew Zealand military personnel of World War I\nNew Zealand recipients of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur\nPeople from Riddells Creek", "machine_text": "Alfred Robin was a French pharmacologist and chemist born on May 16, 1856, in La Fert\u00e9-sous-Jouarre, France.

Robin received his education at the \u00c9cole de pharmacie de Paris, where he later became a professor of pharmacology. It was during his time at the school that he began his research on the biochemistry of the heart and its stimulation by digitalis compounds. He published a series of papers on the subject, establishing the importance of digitalis as a treatment for heart failure and irregular heartbeats. Robin's work on digitalis also led him to isolate and identify other compounds with therapeutic potential. One such compound, sparteine, was found to have antiarrhythmic properties and was used in the treatment of heart disease. In addition to his work on digitalis and other natural compounds, Robin also researched synthetic compounds, including the development of local anesthetics. He was instrumental in testing and introducing the widely used anesthetic cocaine hydrochloride. Robin was recognized for his contributions to the field of pharmacology and chemistry with numerous awards and honors, including the Legion of Honor and the Grand Prix of the Exposition Universelle of 1900.

The facility was constructed in 2013 by EgeGaz, a subsidiary of the Turkish company Enerco. It has a storage capacity of 188,000 cubic meters of LNG and is primarily used for supplying natural gas to the Turkish market. The LNG storage facility consists of four tanks, each with a capacity of 47,000 cubic meters. The facility also has a jetty and unloading arm for receiving LNG shipments. Additionally, the site has a regasification unit that converts the stored LNG back into natural gas for distribution via the Turkish gas network. The Alia\u011fa facility was strategically located in an industrial zone with access to the Trans-Anatolian Natural Gas Pipeline (TANAP). This pipeline connects Turkey to the Shah Deniz gas field in Azerbaijan and is part of the larger Southern Gas Corridor, which transports gas from the Caspian region to Europe. The Alia\u011fa LNG storage facility plays a crucial role in helping to diversify Turkey's energy mix and reduce its dependence on Russia for natural gas imports. Turkey currently imports over 50% of its natural gas from Russia, making it vulnerable to supply disruptions due to geopolitical tension. Furthermore, Egegaz Alia\u011fa LNG Storage Facility has also been recognized for its environmental and safety standards. The facility received the International Safety Award in 2017 from the British Safety Council for its commitment to ensuring a safe working environment for its employees. In summary, the Egegaz Alia\u011fa LNG Storage Facility is a state-of-the-art facility that plays a crucial role in securing Turkey's energy supply and reducing dependence on imports from Russia. Its strategic location, modern infrastructure, and commitment to safety and the environment make it a vital asset for the energy security of Turkey and the wider region.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 53590889}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Destiny Fulfilled\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Destiny Fulfilled is the fifth and final studio album by American R&B trio Destiny's Child. It was released on November 16, 2004, by Columbia Records and Sony Urban Music. A comeback release, it marked the return of Destiny's Child after the group went into hiatus, which allowed each member to release solo albums. Unlike their previous material, this record saw each member equally contributing to the songwriting and production. Destiny's Child further worked with frequent collaborators such as Rockwilder, Swizz Beatz and Rodney Jerkins as well as several new producers.\n\nFor the album's theme, the members drew inspiration from the conversations they had during the first week of recording when they discussed about the happenings in their lives while being apart. Composed mostly of mid-tempo songs and ballads that are subsequent continuations of each other, altogether telling one complete story, Destiny Fulfilled is an R&B album. It was released to generally mixed reviews among music critics who criticized its mid-tempo ballads and lyrical content. The album was commercially successful; it reached number two on the US Billboard 200, and has since been certified triple Platinum in that region. It was also successful in different countries worldwide receiving certifications in Australia, Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom among others.\n\nAs part of the album's promotion, the group performed songs from it on numerous award ceremonies and televised appearances in the US and Europe. They further embarked on the tour Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin' It in 2005 with 67 dates across four continents worldwide. Destiny Fulfilled spawned four singles\u2014the lead single \"Lose My Breath\", \"Soldier\", \"Girl\" and \"Cater 2 U\". After the tour, the group disbanded.\n\nBackground \n\nWhile recording their third studio album Survivor in late 2000, Beyonc\u00e9 announced that Destiny's Child would eventually go on a hiatus that would allow each member to release a solo album, which they hoped would further increase interest in the group. The idea of solo releases emanated from the group's manager, Beyonc\u00e9's father, Mathew Knowles. Kelly Rowland further explained in an interview that Destiny's Child has been present in the media for a long time and they wanted to \"give the public eye a rest from DC for a minute\". During that same interview, she acknowledged that the trio would return to the studio in fall 2003 to start with the work on a new album.\n\nTwo members of the group, Beyonc\u00e9 and Rowland each released one album, while Michelle Williams released two. While each member achieved domestic success, Beyonc\u00e9's had been regarded as the most successful with the release of Dangerously in Love (2003), which enjoyed international commercial success and acclaim. This, along with their other ongoing projects, led to speculation over the disbandment of Destiny's Child. Amidst rumors and speculations, Rowland announced in 2004 their return to the studio to record what would become their fourth and final album. The group claimed that the reunion was destined to happen, and that their affinity to each other kept them together.\n\nAfter this album, the group planned to part ways after their fourteen-year career to facilitate their solo careers. Beyonc\u00e9 has noted that their destinies were already fulfilled; however, Destiny's Child claimed that naming the album Destiny Fulfilled was not a coincidence. Beyonc\u00e9 has said that \"the group felt it still had something to offer musically\" with the album before adding: \"We did this record for ourselves, not to sell a million the first week out... That doesn't mean as much to us as just the fact that three friends got back together to do another record. That was our destiny.\". Rowland commented: \"We were like, 'You know what, we're getting older and we want to end on a high note.' We want to give our fans a great final record\". Beyonc\u00e9, also commented regarding the finality of their career: \"Who knows what will happen in three, five or 10\u00a0years? The main thing is that we maintain our friendship and that we do it because we want to \u2013 not because it's a good business move.\"\n\nProduction and recording \nProduction of the album began in summer of 2004 with Destiny's Child taking help from frequent collaborators including Rockwilder, Swizz Beatz and Rodney Jerkins. The group worked on the album within a period of three weeks. Jerkins, who had worked with Beyonc\u00e9 for her solo album Dangerously in Love, concerned how he would manage the production, saying, \"How is this going to work?' Cause Beyonc\u00e9, she blew up solo, so how's it going to work in a group together?\". He stated that once he got inside the studio, however, his skepticism vanished as he saw the group's \"excitement being back in the studio together\", calling the process \"natural\". The members of the group stated that the first week of recording was spent solely on conversations about the happenings in their lives while being apart from each other as they hadn't spent quality time for a long period. This further inspired them to record the conversations and use it as the main theme of the record.\n\nDiffering from Survivor in that previously Beyonc\u00e9 had taken an active role in writing and producing, Destiny Fulfilled saw each member contributing inputs culled from personal experiences and individual opinions and points of view not dependent from the others'. In most cases, producers of the album would send them a CD containing a track that would be the group's basis in the songwriting process; without the producer's supervision of which part to sing, that formed a new direction of their style different from their previous records. The traditional approach where each member sang one verse and chimed in the chorus was replaced; in some songs in Destiny Fulfilled, their vocals were alternated in every line of the lyrics, a technique similar to hip hop artists. Destiny's Child took the role of executive producing alongside their manager, Mathew Knowles. Beyonc\u00e9, who vocally produced the songs, commented that it was important for her to make sure their voices were audible and identifiable. Taking it as one of her goals, the group decided to focus on mid-tempo songs and on few dance numbers and ballads\u2014which they considered people cannot sing with. Beyonc\u00e9 elaborated \"We wanted to make sure that the songs would be something that we were proud of 10 years from now, 20 years from now. We wanted it to be something that people can really feel an emotion to. Up-tempo songs can do that, but they more make you wanna dance.\" As Rowland was recently engaged in the time of the writing of the album, it further influenced her songwriting. She also cited that being apart from the group affected the album as well: \"All of us have been in three different places\u00a0... so there's a lot to talk about, a lot that's gone on, personally. I think it's important to talk about that on this new record, to put what we've been going through separately into the new record.\"\n\nComposition \nDuring an interview with MTV, Beyonc\u00e9 stated that the songs put altogether tell a complete story and noted that each song was a subsequent continuation to the next one. She concluded, \"[The album continues with] this whole journey of this group of women trying to find love. And truly they find it because they love themselves and find it in themselves. It's friendship, it's love, it's maturity and growth, and it's everything that we wanted it to be.\" For the music of the album, the group tried challenging themselves, working with different arrangements, trying to create an original sound; to succeed in this, they were influenced by The Emotions, Jodeci and SWV mixing elements of their music. Destiny Fulfilled is predominantly an R&B concept album tracing a woman's relationship journey. Critics further found elements of soul music, dance and hip-hop. The album is mostly composed of mid and slowtempo balladry following the opening two songs; Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian felt that the ballads showcased \"the girliness in the trio, musically and lyrically\". Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine found elements of middle of the road music in the ballads.\n\nThe album opens with the up-tempo dance song \"Lose My Breath\", a track detailing a man full of empty promises to a woman. It is musically complete with military, marching-band drums and keyboard stabs and the backing track contains various sound effects. \"Soldier\", the second track with T.I. and Lil Wayne, the only featured artists on the album, contains elements from Southern hip hop and Crunk&B. Unsatisfied and unfulfilled with the lover from the opening song, the protagonists ask for a decent soldier, further singing about finding a gangster. After finding the soldier, the third song, the R&B number \"Cater 2 U\", lyrically is about submissively serving the man considered as such. Inspired by him, the protagonists sing about doing various things to make him happy musically accompanied by synthesizer as the song builds a crescendo.\n\nThe fourth song \"T-Shirt\" is complete with inorganic drum sounds, guitar and backwards loop as the trio sings about sleeping in bed with their man's T-shirt, \"craving his presence, and inhailing his scent\". \"Is She the Reason\" is an R&B ballad which was noted to have a similar chord progression to materials by The Beatles, which lyrically speaks on being in competition with another woman for her mans love & attention. It contains a trumpet-laden sample from Melba Moore's song \"I Don't Know No One Else to Turn To\". The next song, \"Girl\" was noted for its Motown influence and a theme talking about friendship. \"If\", complete with strings, lyrically talks about men who don't appreciate their female lovers until their relationship ends and they realize their mistakes. \"Free\" was described as a \"soul classic from 1975\" with critics also noting elements of 1970s funk music, as the trio speaks on being \"set free\" after being in a relationship where her lover never tending to her desires like she does for him. The midtempo number \"Through with Love\" was noted for having an \"angry\" nature as it talks about a break-up. It contains an undulating piano line as the members of the group sing with restrained vocals and later religious redemption with elements of gospel. In \"Love\", \"capital L kicks the daylights out of the forces of fear, doubt and disappointment\", as the group \"thank[s] God for love\". They further sing about how people \"can't truly love another until [they] love God and then [themselves]\". They further proclaim that they have found love and are \"madly in it\".\n\nRelease and promotion \n\nThe track listing of Destiny Fulfilled was revealed on October 15, 2004. The album was first released in Japan on November 10, 2004. It was released on November 16, 2004, in North America via Columbia Records. Although the original release was intended to be one day earlier, Columbia Records was concerned about \"potential for Internet leaks and 'burned' CD counterfeits\" that could \"lead consumers to experience inferior and incomplete versions of the album\" which led to the postponement of Destiny Fulfilled.\n\nThe group performed \"Lose My Breath\" on ABC's 2004 National Football League \"Opening Kickoff\" special after its online release on September 9, 2004, to break their yearlong hiatus. On October 25, 2004, they appeared at the Radio Music Awards in Las Vegas performing the song with an a cappella jazz opening. The following month they performed three songs from their previous albums and finished with \"Lose My Breath\" on The Oprah Winfrey Show where they also sat down for an interview with Oprah Winfrey. On November 8, 2004, the trio appeared on Total Request Live (TRL) and performed the song along with \"Say My Name\". They went to the German entertainment TV show Wetten, dass..? on November 13, 2004, and performed \"Lose My Breath\". At BET's 106 & Park Destiny's Child performed \"Soldier\" on November 15, 2004. They also performed the song on CBSs The Early Show on December 8, 2004. In early February 2005 they gave another performance of \"Soldier\" at the British show Top of the Pops. At the 2005 NBA All-Star Game on February 20, 2005, they sang both \"Soldier\" and \"Lose My Breath\". They performed the latter song again at the 2005 ESPY Awards on July 13 with the ceremony being aired on ESPN four days later. \"Cater 2 U\" was performed on June 28 during the 2005 BET Awards in Los Angeles.\n\nWhen the advanced release date of the album was announced, the group confirmed the initial dates of their worldwide tour Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin' It in connection with Destiny Fulfilleds promotion. Promotions of the tour were aired over the radio and television across the United States and the group further collaborated with McDonald's, which served as its sponsor. The tour's set list included songs from Destiny Fulfilled as well as Destiny's Child's previous albums and songs from the solo albums of each member performed individually. Numerous costume changes occurred throughout the show; the concert exhibited products from Beyonc\u00e9's clothing line from the House of Der\u00e9on, a company she co-founded with her mother Tina Knowles. A performance from the tour was filmed in Atlanta on July 15, 2005, and the DVD Destiny's Child Live in Atlanta chronicling the concert was released on March 28, 2006.\n\nSingles \nThe album's lead single, \"Lose My Breath\", premiered on AOL Music on September 9, 2004, and it was released on  September 21. Its high-mark debut at number 30 on the Billboard Hot 100 prior to its release gave the album an early boost. The single peaked at number three on the chart for the week ending November 6, 2004 giving the group their ninth top ten single. \"Lose My Breath\" topped the Hot Dance Club Songs chart for the week ending January 8, 2005 and was later certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on April 28, 2005, selling 500,000 copies in the US. It was also successful across Europe, peaking at number one on the European Hot 100 Singles chart for the week ending December 4, 2004 spending four consecutive weeks on top. It managed to top the charts in Belgium, Ireland, Italy and Switzerland and it further appeared in the top ten in almost every other chart. The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) used the song as the music for their introductory montage at the 2004 NBA Playoffs and through the first few weeks of the 2005 NBA Playoffs.\n\n\"Soldier\", released on December 7, 2004, peaked at the third position on the Billboard Hot 100 chart becoming the band's tenth top ten single on that chart. It further became the second single from the album to top the Hot Dance Club Songs chart for the week ending February 26, 2005. The RIAA gave it a gold certification for selling 500,000 digital copies in the US. \"Soldier\" further peaked at number four on the UK Singles Chart, number 3 on the ARIA Charts in Australia and appeared in the top 20 in many European countries. The third single from the album, \"Girl\" was released on May 2, 2005, in the UK and on May 17 in the US. It was successful on the ARIA Chart peaking at number five and number six both on the UK Singles Chart and the New Zealand Singles Chart in addition to appearing in other European charts. In the US, it peaked at number 23 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart becoming the lowest charting single there from the album. The fourth and final single from Destiny Fulfilled was \"Cater 2 U\" released in the US and Italy only beginning on June 14, 2005. It peaked at number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number three on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs further being certified gold by the RIAA.\n\nOther songs\n\"Got's My Own\" was released a promotional single on May 3, 2005.\n\nCritical reception \n\nDestiny Fulfilled received mixed reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 52 based on 17 reviews. Dimitri Ehrlich of Vibe magazine complimented the production of the album, saying that it \"showcases advanced production values\" with \"impressive\" songwriting and vocal abilities and concluded that it \"offers divine satisfaction\". A writer of Billboard felt that Destiny Fulfilled worked as \"a testament to Beyonc\u00e9's evolving multiple talents\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic praised Rowland's and Williams' abilities as vocalists and their contributions to the choruses, but felt that Beyonc\u00e9 \"steals every song on Destiny Fulfilled\" further commending her for sounding \"larger than life even when she's quiet\"; however he concluded, \"as a whole, the album winds up sounding too reserved and heavy-handed, which makes it a disappointment\". Andy Battaglia of The A.V. Club wrote in his review that \"Destiny Fulfilled sounds distant and detached\" further criticizing its mid-tempo ballads for sounding \"uninterrupted at best, uninspired at worst\". Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times commented that it is \"a surprisingly perfunctory disc that never quite justifies its existence\". Alan Ranta of Tiny Mix Tapes doubted Beyonc\u00e9's lyrical sincerity, saying, \"the success of this album depends once again on the complete suspension of die-hard fans' disbelief that Beyonc\u00e9 'Your Ad Here' Knowles could ever actually truly love another human being as much as she loves herself and her possessions.\"\n\nCaroline Sullivan of The Guardian commented that the lead vocals of the songs were likely to be sung by each member equally, noting that it made the album a \"democratic\" one; however she criticized them for squandering \"the extent of their talents\" on the album. Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly also noticed its \"overall air of democracy at work\" and noted that Destiny Fulfilled \"often moves at a molasses-like pace, weighted down with a preponderance of exquisitely executed but ultimately dull ballads\". Jenny Eliscu of Rolling Stone magazine echoed his comments, saying, \"In all but a couple of songs, the verses are divided into three sections, with Beyonce leading things off, followed by Rowland, then Williams\". She noted that after a couple of upbeat songs, \"the album slumps into an endless string of overwrought R&B ballads where the only saving grace is\u00a0... these ladies can harmonize like nobody's business.\" Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine has commented that the ballads of the album build into \"the same sort of standoffish sexual supply-and-demand bartering that has marred their worst tracks\". Most of the critics questioned why Beyonc\u00e9 had to return to Destiny's Child after achieving the most success among the members of the group. Henderson lambasted Beyonc\u00e9 to performing again with the group with the \"full intention\" of taking advantage to bolster her \"divette\" status to superstardom. In May 2006, Destiny Fulfilled was listed at number 24 on a list titled \"The 50 Worst Albums Ever!\" compiled by Q magazine.\n\nAccolades \nThe album won in the category for Favorite Soul/R&B Album at the 2005 American Music Awards where Destiny's Child also won the Favorite Soul/R&B Band award. At the 2005 Soul Train Music Awards Destiny Fulfilled received an award for Best R&B/Soul Album while \"Soldier\" received Best R&B/Soul Single. The album was nominated in the category for Best Contemporary R&B Album at the 48th Grammy Awards in 2006 but it lost to Mariah Carey's The Emancipation of Mimi. Its singles \"Soldier\" and \"Cater 2 U\" further received nominations in three different categories at the same ceremony. The previous year, \"Lose My Breath\" was nominated in the category for Best R&B Vocal Performance by a Duo Or Group at the 47th Annual Grammy Awards.\n\nCommercial performance \n\nIn the United States, the album debuted at number 19 on the Billboard 200 for the week ending November 27, 2004 for amassing sales of 61,000 copies prior to a whole tracking week. In its first official week of sales, Destiny Fulfilled sold over 497,000 copies, with an increase of 713% compared to its early sales; the album's chart position rocketed to number two on the Billboard\u00a0200 for the week ending December 4, 2004. In the same week, it debuted at number one on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart becoming the group's second chart topper following Survivor in 2001.

The album peaked at number 3 on the Canadian Albums Chart and was awarded Platinum certification by Music Canada selling 100,000 copies.\n\nIn the UK, Destiny Fulfilled debuted at number five on the UK Albums Chart on November 27, 2004, which also became its peak position in that country. Having spent a total of 21 weeks on the chart, it became the group's third album to enter the top ten in the UK until 2005 and the fourth one in their entire career. On November 19, 2004, the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) certified it Platinum for selling 300,000 copies. On the Irish Albums Chart, Destiny Fulfilled debuted and peaked at number 6 on November 18, 2004, becoming Destiny's Child third consecutive top ten album in Ireland. It was also successful in other European countries, peaking at number 3 on the German Albums Chart, further being certified Platinum in that region. In France, Destiny Fulfilled peaked at number nine in its first week on November 14, 2004. It was last seen on the country's albums chart at number 163 on September 3, 2005.\n\nOn the Australian ARIA Albums Chart, Destiny Fulfilled debuted at number 11 on November 28, 2004, a position which later became its peak. Spending a total of 31 weeks through 2004 and 2005 ascending and descending the chart, the album was certified Platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for shipment of 70,000 copies in that region. In New Zealand, Destiny Fulfilled peaked at number 21 on April 25, 2005, and the Recorded Music NZ (RMNZ) awarded it with a gold certification for 7,500 copies sold. In Japan, the album debuted and peaked at number four on the Oricon chart due to the success of \"Lose My Breath\" which reached number one on the singles chart there. The album has sold over 625,000 copies there and was certified double Platinum by Oricon making it Destiny's Child's biggest success there to date. It won in the category Rock/Pop Album of the Year International at the 19th Japan Gold Disc Award in 2005 organized by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ). Destiny Fulfilled was named the eighth best-selling album of 2004 worldwide by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI). The album has sold over 7,000,000 copies worldwide.\n\nDisbandment \nIn a visit at the Palau Sant Jordi in Barcelona, Spain on July 11, 2005, Rowland announced before 16,000 spectators that Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin' It would be Destiny's Child last tour together, revealing their formal disbandment. After their final North American leg, the group parted ways. In a statement released to MTV, the band said that the tour had provided them the opportunity to depart from Destiny's Child on a \"high note\". They also talked about the moment when the group started their musical endeavor and their realizations of pursuing individual careers after working together for several years. Destiny's Child thanked fans for their support while not closing the chance of seeing them continuing each member's goals in music, film, and television. In another interview they explained that their disbandment was planned during the making of the album. While in the studio, they discussed individual aspirations and realized that remaining as a group would prevent them in pursuing those interests. Rowland revealed that they wanted to break up while they were still successful and \"friends [with each other]\". Beyonc\u00e9, however, emphasized that Destiny Fulfilled would not be their last album and disclosed the idea of a possible reunion.\n\nTrack listing \nCredits adapted from the album's liner notes\n\nNotes\n signifies a producer and vocal producer\n signifies a vocal producer\n signifies a co-producer\n signifies an additional vocal producer\n\nSample Credits\n \"Is She the Reason\" contains excerpts from \"I Don't Know No One Else to Turn To\", performed by Melba Moore, written by Victor Carstarphen, Gene McFadden and John Whitehead.\n \"Girl\" contains sampled elements from the composition \"Ocean of Thoughts and Dreams\", performed by the Dramatics, written by Don Davis and Eddie Robinson.\n \"If\" contains excerpts from \"Inseparable\", performed by Natalie Cole, written by Charles Jackson and Marvin Yancy.\n \"Free\" contains excerpts from \"Night Whistler\", performed by Donald Byrd, written by Larry Mizell, Fonce Mizell and James Carter.\n \"Game Over\" contains excerpts from \"Flashback\", performed by Dee Dee Sharp, written by Michael Burton and Phil Terry.\n \"What's It Gonna Be\" contains replayed elements of \"Do It Roger\", performed by Roger, written by Roger Troutman and Larry Troutman.\n \"Independent Women Part II\" contains elements of \"Peabody's Improbable History\", performed and written by Frank Comstock.\n\nPersonnel\nCredits are adapted from the Destiny Fulfilled liner notes.\n\nNoemi Bonazzi \u2013 prop stylist\nJim Caruana \u2013 recording engineer (tracks 1, 3\u20139, 11), engineering (2)\nCandice Childress \u2013 production coordination (track 7)\nBryan Michael Cox \u2013 keyboards (track 7), drum machine (7)\nTom Coyne \u2013 mastering\nKendrick Dean \u2013 keyboards (track 7)\nVincent Dilorenzo \u2013 recording engineer (track 4)\nAndre Harris \u2013 mixing\nEric Hunter \u2013 recording engineer (track 10)\nTy Hunter \u2013 stylist\nRodney Jerkins \u2013 instrumentation (tracks 1, 3)\nKimberly Kimble \u2013 hair stylist\nFabian Marasciullo \u2013 additional vocal engineering (track 2)\nMally Roncal \u2013 make-up\nRic Rude \u2013 instrumentation (track 3)\nTim \"Timmy Shakes\" Stewart \u2013 guitar (track 3)\nTom Tapley \u2013 additional vocal engineering (track 2)\nSam Thomas \u2013 digital editing, additional Pro-Tools editing (7)\nJeff Villanueva \u2013 recording engineer (tracks 1, 3)\nRommel Nino Villanueva \u2013 digital editing, additional Pro-Tools Editing (tracks 2, 8)\n\nProduction\n\nKelly Rowland \u2013 vocal producer\nMichelle Williams \u2013 vocal producer\nSam Thomas \u2013 vocal editing\nRommel Nino Villanueva \u2013 vocal editing\nAndrew Dawson \u2013  mixing (5)\nVincent Dilorenzo \u2013 mixing (4)\nDre & Vidal \u2013 mixing (4)\nTony Maserati \u2013 mixing (tracks: 1, 3, 9, 11)\nDave Pensado \u2013 mixing (tracks: 5, 6, 8)\nPhil Tan \u2013 mixing (7)\nDexter Simmons \u2013 mixing (2, 10)\nTheresa LaBarbera Whites \u2013 A&R\nHuy Nguyen \u2013 A&R\nAlice Butts \u2013 design, art direction\nIan Cuttler \u2013 design, art direction\nFabrizio Ferri \u2013 photography\n\nCharts\n\nWeekly charts\n\nYear-end charts\n\nDecade-end charts\n\nCertifications\n\nSee also \n List of Billboard number-one R&B albums of 2004\n List of Billboard number-one R&B albums of 2005\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \n\n2004 albums\nAlbums produced by 9th Wonder\nAlbums produced by Bryan-Michael Cox\nAlbums produced by Dre & Vidal\nAlbums produced by Rodney Jerkins\nAlbums produced by Sean Garrett\nAlbums produced by Rich Harrison\nAlbums produced by Rockwilder\nDestiny's Child albums\nColumbia Records albums\nSony Urban Music albums\nAlbums produced by Beyonc\u00e9", "machine_text": "Destiny Fulfilled is the fourth and final studio album by the American R&B group, Destiny's Child. It was released on November 10, 2004, by Columbia Records. The album consists of fourteen tracks, with an additional two bonus tracks on some international editions. The album features the hit singles \"Lose My Breath,\" \"Soldier,\" \"Cater 2 U,\" and \"Girl\". With Destiny Fulfilled, the girls of Destiny's Child marked the end of an era with style and grace. After eight years and four successful studio albums, Destiny's Child decided to take a break in 2002. In 2004, the girls reunited to record the album that will be their last. Destiny Fulfilled represents a departure from the group's previous sounds. The album is more focused on live instrumentation. Destiny Fulfilled also features a more mature sound which was a reflection of the growth they had experienced over the years. The album sold over 500,000 copies in its first week and went platinum within the first month. The album received positive reviews from music critics, with many praising the group's vocal harmonies, and the diversity of their sound. The album peaked at number two on the Billboard 200, and remained on the chart for 77 weeks. Destiny Fulfilled was accompanied by a world tour which kicked off in April 2005. The tour was a massive success, and it was one of the highest-grossing tours of that year. The tour grossed over $70 million and sold out arenas all over the world. Destiny Fulfilled signaled the end of the Destiny's Child era, but Beyonc\u00e9, Kelly and Michelle moved on to successful solo careers in music, television, and film. With over 60 million albums sold collectively, and numerous awards, they remain one of the most successful girl groups of all time.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 972631}

It was once home to the Fagan family. In 1980 Bruce Fagan and his sister, Ida, donated the land to the New South Wales State Government. Hornsby Shire Council was appointed sole trustee. The park was officially opened by the Premier of New South Wales, Nick Greiner, MP on 5 November 1988.\n\nHistory \n\nThe Fagan Family\n\nWilliam Fagan was a free settler who emigrated from Derry in Ireland who arrived in Sydney in 1848. He later married Ann Waddell and the couple had three sons and four daughters. After their marriage the Fagans purchased  of land in Arcadia, New South Wales and the family established a successful citrus orchard. They were pioneers in the citrus industry in Dural, Galston and Arcadia, on the north-western outskirts of Sydney. Two of William and Ann's sons, William and Samuel, worked in the family business and later began their own operation at Dural. In 1900, Samuel and his wife acquired land at Galston and conducted their business on the property. They constructed 'Netherby,' a house made of bricks that were hand made. The property was the largest orchard in Galston and had a sizable workforce.\n\nBy the early 1930s, because of the arrival of the Great Depression, Samuel Fagan commenced to closed down his orchards. Bruce Fagan, the youngest child in the family, ran a herd of Jersey dairy cattle on the property after the closure of the orchard. He later added a dairy building to the property and commenced a renowned cattle breeding programme. In 1980 Bruce Fagan and his sister, Ida, donated the original property, \"Fagan Park,\" to the Department of Lands. The Hornsby Shire Council was appointed as the sole trustee for the park. Before his death in 1984, Bruce Fagan was consulted regarding development plans for the site.\n\nBicentennial Project\n\nThe Bicentenary of Australia was celebrated in 1988. It marked the occasion of the beginning of European settlement of Australia, with the arrival of the First Fleet of British convict ships at Sydney in 1788. A national programme of events and celebrations was organised to celebrate the occasion and Fagan Park was adopted as Hornsby Shire Council's bicentennial project. The Council received a government grant towards the cost of the planned \"Garden of Many Nations.\" The garden now covers  of the park and features the flora of countries from all over the world including North America and South America, Great Britain, Africa, Asia and the Netherlands The original homestead, 'Netherby', together with the original milking complex and packing shed, were also restored for the bicentennial year. \"Netherby\" is regularly opened for inspection and the packing shed and milking complex are used as a rural museum.\n\nSport and Recreation \n\n The Galston Parkrun event is held every Saturday at 8\u00a0am. This is a timed run over 5 kilometres. It is organised by volunteers and is free of charge.\n The Hornsby Electric Model Flying Club meets in the park.\n The Friends of Fagan Park meet regularly.\n The Fagan Park Eco Garden is a Council-driven community initiative that showcases environmentally friendly gardening techniques.

The park follows the traditional trust, owned and operated by the Hornsby Shire Council since its establishment in 1993. Fagan Park spans over 55 hectares and serves as a major entertainment and recreational hub for the region. The park was named after Dorothy Fagan, a farmer's wife who donated a significant portion of her land to the council to create the park. The park was then developed with the inclusion of gardens, walking tracks, a playground, picnic areas, and BBQ facilities. The park's natural bushland, gardens, and ponds provide a peaceful and relaxing environment for visitors. Fagan Park is particularly renowned for its diversity in flora and fauna. The park features various species of trees, including grevilleas, wattles, and eucalypts, which attract native birds such as kookaburras and lorikeets. The park's wildlife also includes wallabies, koalas, and possums. Apart from its natural beauty, Fagan Park hosts a range of activities and events throughout the year. Regular events include concerts, markets, and festivals. The park also has several designated picnic areas that can be hired for private events, such as weddings, birthdays, and corporate functions. The park has undergone several major upgrades over the years, with the most significant being the addition of the Garden of Many Nations in 2000. The garden features a range of themed gardens, including Chinese, Australian, European, and Japanese gardens, showcasing different cultures and their unique flora. In conclusion, Fagan Park serves as a valuable public space for locals and tourists, providing a perfect mix of natural beauty, recreational activities, and cultural experiences.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Cruising (driving)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Cruising is a social activity that primarily consists of driving a car. Cruising can be an expression of the freedom of possessing a driver's license. Cruising is distinguished from regular driving by the social and recreational nature of the activity, which is characterized by an impulsively random, often aimless course. A popular route (or \"strip\") is often the focus of cruising. \"Cruise nights\" are evenings during which cars drive slowly. A cruise can be a meeting of car enthusiasts at a predetermined location, organised predominantly through the internet (in recent times) but also largely through mobile phone, word of mouth or simply by a cruise being established enough that it becomes a regular event.\n\nSome ethnic groups identify with lifestyles related to cruising, such as the Hispanos of New Mexico, Chicanos, and Mexican-Americans of the Southwestern United States along U.S. Route 66. Meets, like those at lowrider and auto shows, are popular across the United States and worldwide in large part due to these ethnic communities.\n\nUnited States\n\nHistory\nThere is no clear-cut date when casual driving turned into cruising along a specific route, although it generally began in the years after World War II with youths of Mexican heritage driving lowriders in Southern California towns, and it rapidly became a popular teenage activity.\n\nCruising culture was an evolution of old traditions of strolling down Main Street or around the town square. Although cruising was predominantly boys showing off their cars (ostensibly to meet girls), groups of girls joined in cruising as well. One appeal of cruising was that youths could evade the supervision of parents and family.\n\nDriving slowly down long, straight streets, preferably with many traffic lights to increase opportunities to talk to other cruisers or pedestrians, was only one part of cruising. Cruisers would also gather in parking lots, particularly those of drive-ins. As a Tucson journalist noted, \"Cruisers, like moths and June bugs, eventually congregate around brightly lighted areas.\" Cruisers were also apt to arrange impromptu races with other cruisers.\n\nAs early as the 1960s, some towns established ordinances to prohibit driving through parking lots without stopping and the police issued tickets for loitering and curfew violations. Increasingly, cruisers would travel from wider areas to gather on popular strips, with police viewing these visitors as troublemakers. Reports of clashes between groups of cruisers began to appear in local newspapers.\n\nHowever, cruising continued to remain popular, with wildly painted vans and pickup trucks joining hot rods and muscle cars in the 1970s. In many locales, there was a generally positive relationship with law enforcement. Racing in populated areas was discouraged by police surveillance and traffic, but cruisers engaged in other games such as mooning onlookers, laying rubber when a signal turned green, and \"chinese fire drills\" in which all occupants of a car stopped at a light would get out, run around the car, and jump back in.\n\nThere was some decline in cruising in the 1970s, possibly connected to the rise of gas prices but also due to a growing change in community attitudes toward cruising. The San Francisco Bay Area had a \"cruising summit\" in 1977 for area police to discuss \"our mutual problems with cruising\". The gathering numbers of vehicles and increases in tensions and violence led many communities to begin looking for ways to discourage cruising, despite many adults retaining a permissive acceptance of cruising with nostalgia for their own cruising days. Although business merchants and shoppers had been inconvenienced for years by cruisers, tolerance had dissipated and law enforcement was encouraged to step in.\n\nDuring the summer of 1974, Los Angeles police began cracking down on cruising, first by banning parking along Van Nuys Boulevard and then in August making it a one-way street. The following summer, as many as 15,000 youths from as far away as San Diego converged on Van Nuys, encouraged by local disc jockeys. A similar crackdown on Whittier Boulevard led to the formation of a cruiser's rights group. Police barricaded portions of Whittier in an attempt to disrupt cruising, but even local adults objected to this practice. Other measures were tried, such as shutting portions of Whittier down completely at night. Cruisers moved to Highland Avenue, resulting in the arrest of 170 during the second weekend of September 1979. The following summer, a section of Van Nuys was closed after 9 p.m. The rationale for the blockade was that it only required fifteen police to close the road, but they would need at least 150 officers to police the 15,000 cruisers who had gathered there. \n\nAs quickly as one strip became unusable, cruisers would find new sites. It became a persistent battle between authorities and cruisers. In 1982, the California state legislature passed a law that gave cities express sanction to shut down streets being used for cruising, when driving \"for purposes of socializing and assembling interferes with the conduct of businesses, wastes precious energy resources, impedes the progress of general traffic and emergency vehicles, and promotes the generation of local concentrations of air pollution and undesirable noise levels\".\n\nEfforts to stop cruising continued, with increasing blockades and mass arrests. In 1985, random checkpoints began to appear, with police stopping cars passing the spot more than once in a given timeframe. Computers were added in 1988 to help track the cars. New curfews for minors were established. Cruising in southern California was generally suppressed by 1990. Other regions used tactics similar to southern California's, with similar mixed results. Police in Galveston, Texas began arresting cruisers, but had to back down in the face of parental complaints. Joplin, Missouri attempted a ban on cruising, but had to repeal it. Merchants in Portland, Oregon complained that they were losing business because of the crackdowns. Multiple towns across the U.S. adopted the checkpoint system.\n\nOther towns tried creative alternatives, such as Laurel, Mississippi and Princeton, West Virginia, which both channeled cruisers onto routes that would not interfere with local businesses. Setting aside parking lots specifically for cruisers was tried in Cedar Rapids, Iowa and Columbus, Indiana. The town of Big Stone Gap, Virginia chose to embrace cruising, awarding prizes for the best customized vehicles.\n\nCities continue to struggle with the problems of cruising into the 2000s. In 2006, Milwaukee, Wisconsin even explored letting police confiscate cruisers' cars. \n\nWhile communities try to prevent impromptu cruising, multiple towns have embraced organized cruising revivals. The Woodward Dream Cruise occurs on the third Saturday in August along the original cruising strip in Detroit's northern suburbs. The event is a tribute to the classic Woodward cruisers and attracts approximately 1 million people and 40,000\u00a0muscle cars, street rods, and custom, collector, and special interest vehicles. Waukegan, Illinois, has an annual summer cruising festival called \"Scoopin' Genesee\". and Modesto, California celebrates \"Graffiti Summer\" with an annual cruise parade. Renton, Washington hosts \"Cruz the Loop\" each summer, and in 2020 erected a sculpture to honor cruising the loop.\n\nWell-known strips\nOne of the oldest cruising strips in East Los Angeles is located on Whittier Boulevard. Cruising on this strip became a popular pastime among lowriders during the 1940s before spreading to surrounding neighborhoods in the 1950s.  Van Nuys Boulevard in the central San Fernando Valley has been a popular cruising strip since the 1950s; the 1979 film Van Nuys Blvd. depicted the cruising culture on the strip. In the late 1970s, the Wednesday night cruise on Van Nuys attracted up to 40,000 cars. Sunset Boulevard was another popular cruise strip.\n\nPerhaps the most famous cruising strip (or main drag), however, is McHenry Avenue in Modesto, California.  The cruising culture of the late 1950s and early 1960s was depicted in the film American Graffiti. The film was set (but not actually filmed) in director George Lucas's home town of Modesto, which also hosts an annual \"Graffiti Summer\" celebration in the film's honor.\n\nCruising in Detroit was popular from the 1950s to the 1970s in the city's northern suburbs along M-1 (Woodward Avenue), from Ferndale north to Pontiac. Cruising along Woodward reached its peak in the mid-1960s, with muscle car competitions that were covered by journalists from Car and Driver, Motor Trend, and CBS World News Roundup. Other popular cruising strips in the Detroit area include US\u00a024 (Telegraph Road) from 12 Mile Road in Southfield to Michigan Avenue in Dearborn, and M-3 (Gratiot Avenue) on the East Side.\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nDescription\nThere are two main types of cruise: regular cruises, also known as meets, and one-off cruises.  The events that take place are similar; cars meet in car parks, park up or cruise (drive slowly) around the car park while people socialise \u2013 often meeting people from cruise websites, show off their cars and admire others' cars. If there is enough space there are often drag races, burnouts, and doughnuts.\n\nMeets\nA meet is a regular gathering, usually weekly or monthly, where the time and place is freely publicised and well known. It is becoming more common these days for these events to be referred to incorrectly as cruises.\n\nOne-off cruises\nA one-off cruise is an event organised by a particular group of people or club which would usually be advertised through cruise websites.  The final destination of the cruise is often kept secret; it is known only to the convoy leaders in an attempt to keep the cruise unknown to the police until there are a large enough numbers of people at the cruise to make it difficult to disperse.\n\nOne-off cruises tend to be larger than meets, but larger meets may have magazine attendance.  This type of cruise is increasing in recent times due to increased police interest in regular, established cruises.\n\nSome large cruises operate a \"convoy-only\" policy.\n\nLocations\nCruises are generally held in retail parks due to the large open car parks needed to accommodate high attendance numbers (sometimes more than 500 cars). Naturally, with many cruises situated in retail parks, most cruise locations are also in close proximity to fast food restaurants such as McDonald's or Burger King.\n\nCruising and the law \n\nAlthough cruising is often not a crime in itself, there are many illegal activities associated with it, and as such cruises are often monitored by the police or even closed. The most commonly cited reasons for breaking up cruises are breach of the peace, caused by loud exhausts and sound systems disturbing local residents, and dangerous driving (such as street racing, burnouts and doughnuts). Police also claim that cruises are used as cover for drug dealing and are attended by stolen or otherwise illegal cars. More recently, police have been using ASBO laws which enable them to seize and impound cars if anti-social behaviour is taking place or if a group refuses to disperse from an area.\n\nAs a result of increased police powers, legal cruises have been established such as Weston Wheels, although these tend to resemble car shows with camping, music stages and trade stalls.  This passive, organised nature often does not satisfy the desires of cruisers, so illegal cruising continues.\n\nMany city councils have successfully placed court injunctions to prevent boy racers parking cars in areas that have been popular with them.\n\nMagazines \n\nCruising and modifying have long been represented in the commercial magazines Max Power, Fast Car and Redline.  In mid-2006, Max Power, the magazine that brought cruises to the forefront, abandoned the scene \u2013 preferring to concentrate on \"dream\" cars such as Nissan Skylines. Long-time rival Fast Car assumed Max Power's position and now covers multiple cruises across the UK in each edition.\n\nSee also \n Car customizing\n Hot rod\n Cal-Style VW\n Import scene\n Street racing\n Back to the Bricks\n\nSweden \n Raggare\n\nUK and Republic of Ireland \n Boy racer\n Chav\n Supercar Season\n Scanger\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading \n\nAutomotive events\nDriving\nKustom Kulture\nTransport culture", "machine_text": "Cruising is a term commonly used in the United States to refer to the act of driving around in a car for leisure, pleasure or to show off. This activity has its roots in the 1950s when teenage culture started gaining popularity in the country. Since then, cruising has become a widespread phenomenon in many parts of America, particularly in suburban areas. The activity of cruising typically involves driving slowly around a predetermined circular route, or a cruising loop, usually in a downtown or suburban area. The loop may be chosen depending on the availability of facilities such as parking lots, restaurants, shopping centers and other points of interest. Cruisers usually drive around in their personal cars or motorcycles, stop, chat and display their cars to onlookers. Cruising has been associated with the development of a car culture since the 1950s, particularly among young people. It is a form of socializing and a way to connect with others with whom one shares common interests, in this case, cars. In addition to socializing, cruising has also been viewed as a way of self-expression, particularly among young people in search of identity. In some cases, cruising has become a cause of concern for local authorities due to traffic congestion and noise pollution. Consequently, some cities have enforced regulations to control or prohibit the activity, or created designated areas for cruising. Nevertheless, many still participate in the activity, and it remains a popular pastime in the United States. In conclusion, cruising is an American multidimensional activity that has influenced popular culture, music, fashion, and advertising. It is an activity that continues to be celebrated in various communities across the United States, although it has also been the subject of scrutiny. Cruising remains a significant part of popular culture and will continue to evolve and influence the younger generation of drivers in the country.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2473207}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Person to Person\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Person to Person is a popular television program in the United States that originally ran from 1953 to 1961, with two episodes of an attempted revival airing in 2012. Edward R. Murrow hosted the original series from its inception in 1953 until 1959, interviewing celebrities in their homes from a comfortable chair in his New York studio (his opening: \"Good evening, I'm Ed Murrow. And the name of the program is 'Person to Person'. It's all live \u2013 there's no film\"). In the last two years of its original run, Charles Collingwood was the host.\n\nAlthough Murrow is best remembered as a reporter on programs such as Hear It Now and See It Now and for publicly confronting Senator Joseph McCarthy, on Person to Person he was a pioneer of the celebrity interview.\n\nThe program was well planned but not strictly scripted, with as many as six cameras and TV lighting installed to cover the guest's moves through his home, and a microwave link to transmit the signals back to the network. The guests wore wireless microphones to pick up their voices as they moved around the home or its grounds. The interviews were done live. The two 15-minute interviews in each program were typically with very different types of people, such as a movie star and a scientist. Guests often used the appearance to promote their latest project or book.\n\nGuests\nThe first guest was Roy Campanella who had just hit a Home run to win Game 3 for the Brooklyn Dodgers against the New York Yankees in the 1953 World Series. He later appeared in a wheelchair in 1959 following his automobile accident.\n\nThe long list of guests included then-Senator John F. Kennedy and his wife Jacqueline, Elizabeth Taylor, Andy Williams (1960), Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, Mae West, Jerry Lewis, Marlon Brando, Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, Liberace, Ethel Waters, Sammy Davis Jr., Groucho and Harpo Marx, Margaret Mead, Harry Truman, Marilyn Monroe, W.C. Handy, Duke Ellington, Tallulah Bankhead, No\u00ebl Coward, Ethel Merman, Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh, Fidel Castro, Bing Crosby, Julie Newmar, Leopold Stokowski, Kirk Douglas and John Steinbeck.\n\nThe show featuring Bing Crosby and Mary Margaret McBride in December 1953 was the first time the show appeared in the Top 10 TV shows as measured by Trendex. The highest-rated featured Elizabeth Taylor, Mike Todd and Mark Van Doren with a 35 Trendex.\n\nRevivals\nOn December 15, 2011, CBS News announced they would bring back the news series with Charlie Rose and Lara Logan as hosts.   The network announced plans for two separately-scheduled episodes, based on pre-taped rather than live interviews.   According to Susan Zirinsky, an executive producer of the new show and of 48 Hours, they \"tried to stay true to Edward R. Murrow's concept.  The two reporters remain in New York, and we are taken in by the artist or the newsmaker into a special place.  There's an intimacy when someone allows you into their home.\"\n\nThe first episode, airing on February 8, 2012, featured interviews with George Clooney, Jon Bon Jovi, and Warren Buffett.  The premiere attracted 5.9 million viewers, less than a third of the viewers watching American Idol and fewer than the 8.44 million who watched The Middle; it outrated One Tree Hill and Whitney, though the latter attracted a larger share of the 18\u201349 audience.\n\nHad the two specially-scheduled episodes been well-received, Person to Person could have become a regularly scheduled series. The second episode aired on November 23, 2012 (Black Friday), featuring Sean Penn, Alicia Keys and Drew Brees.\n\nIn the rebranding of CBSN into CBS News in 2022, a second revival was announced to run on the service and be hosted by Norah O'Donnell.\n\nSee also\nPerson to Bunny, a 1959 Merrie Melodies cartoon inspired by Person to Person\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\n \n\nCBS original programming\n1953 American television series debuts\n1961 American television series endings\n2012 American television series debuts\n2012 American television series endings\nAmerican live television series\nBlack-and-white American television shows\nEnglish-language television shows\nTelevision series by CBS Studios\nCBS News\nAmerican television series revived after cancellation", "machine_text": "Person to Person is a popular television program that was first aired in 1953 and ran until 1961. The show was created by legendary newsman Edward R. Murrow and it featured interviews of some of the leading figures of the time. In its first year, the show was aired once a month, and for the rest of its run, it was shown every week. The format of the show was quite simple, with Murrow conducting the interviews in a conversational style in front of the camera. The interviews took place in the interviewer's home, creating an informal and intimate setting. Over the years, some of the most prominent personalities of the time were interviewed on Person to Person, including Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Marilyn Monroe, and John F. Kennedy, among many others. Edward R. Murrow was a prominent journalist and commentator at the time and was best known for his coverage of World War II. The success of Person to Person cemented his status as one of the most respected voices in the media and solidified the importance of TV as a medium for journalism. The show was significant both for its content and for its format. Person to Person broke new ground in bringing celebrities and public figures into the living rooms of ordinary Americans, creating a more democratic and participatory culture. Moreover, the conversational format of the show made for a more relaxed atmosphere, allowing the interviewees to open up in ways that traditional news shows could not. Although Person to Person ended in 1961, its legacy lives on. Its informal, conversational style paved the way for other shows that followed, and its influence can still be seen in the many interview shows that are so popular today.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 3063581}

It was discovered on 18 December 1992, by Belgian astronomer Eric Elst at CERGA in Caussols (), southeastern France. The asteroid was named after the Swedish city of Gothenburg (G\u00f6teborg).\n\nOrbit and classification \n\nG\u00f6teborg is a member of the Eos family, an orbital group of more than 4,000 asteroids, which are well known for mostly being of stony composition with a relatively high albedo. It orbits the Sun in the outer main-belt at a distance of 2.8\u20133.2\u00a0AU once every 5 years and 2 months (1,892 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.06 and an inclination of 11\u00b0 with respect to the ecliptic.\n\nThe body's observation arc begins 61 years prior to its official discovery observation, with a precovery taken the night before its first identification as  at Lowell Observatory in January 1931.\n\nPhysical characteristics\n\nSlow rotator \n\nIn September 2012, photometric observations of G\u00f6teborg at the Palomar Transient Factory, California, rendered a rotational lightcurve with a period of  hours, or 14 days, and a brightness variation of 0.70 magnitude (). This makes a slow rotator, as most asteroids of this size typically have much shorter rotation periods.\n\nDiameter and albedo \n\nAccording to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, G\u00f6teborg measures 15.491 and 15.689 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.084 and 0.1169, respectively The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of 0.14, taken from 221\u00a0Eos, the family's largest member and namesake \u2013 and calculates a diameter of 11.53 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 12.44.\n\nNaming \n\nThis minor planet was named after Gothenburg (G\u00f6teborg), Sweden's second-largest city and the largest port in the Nordic countries, located on the country's southwest coast. Founded in the early 17th century and heavily influenced by the Dutch, the city still has its typical canal system. Later, the Swedes acquired political power over Gothenburg and the city flourished with the development of the Swedish East India Company in the early 18th century.

The planet is named after the city of Gothenburg in Sweden, which is known for its rich history and cultural significance. 10551 G\u00f6teborg orbits the Sun once every 4.32 years and is approximately 6.4 kilometers in diameter. It is classified as an S-type asteroid, which means it has a stony composition with little or no metal. The discovery of 10551 G\u00f6teborg was part of a larger effort to search for Near Earth Objects (NEOs) that could pose a threat to our planet. The Kvistaberg Observatory played a significant role in this effort and has discovered many asteroids and comets since its establishment in 1931. Despite its relatively small size, 10551 G\u00f6teborg is of great scientific interest as it offers insights into the formation and evolution of our Solar System. Scientists study minor planets like this to better understand the conditions that existed in the early Solar System, and how the planets and other celestial bodies formed. 10551 G\u00f6teborg is not visible to the naked eye and can only be observed through telescopes. It poses no threat to Earth, as its orbit does not cross our planet's orbit.

He completed a PhD supervised by Hedley Bull, on the global nuclear strategies of the United States and the Soviet Union. He was based for several months in the USA at the Institute of War and Peace.  He joined ANU as a lecturer in 1974, later becoming Special Professor in the Strategic and Defence Studies Centre in the ANU College of Asia and the Pacific in 1987.\n\nBall was an opponent of the draft for the Vietnam War in Australia (although not the war itself, at the time), and was arrested for protesting against it. He won an appeal in the Supreme Court against his conviction. From 1966 he was a \"person of interest\" for ASIO, particularly following his inquiries into the Pine Gap secret tracking facility and Nurrungar in Australia from 1969, and was taken to court after the publication of A Suitable Piece of Real Estate in 1980.

She was awarded two medals for her actions in the Great Patriotic War (1941\u20131945), where she served as a navigator of the 46th Taman Guards Night Bomber Aviation Regiment, known by the Germans as the Night Witches. Later in her life, she was elected a Deputy of the Supreme Soviet of Abkhazia.\n\nBiography \nAvidzba and her twin sister Hadzhera were born on 24 January 1917. She attended Sukhumi School No. 10. When Victor Argun, the first male Abkhazian pilot, came to recruit aviators, Avidzba initially missed the opportunity. She later joined the Red Banner School of the Civil Air Fleet in Bataysk.\n\nAfter graduating from Bataysk's Flight School, she joined Sukhum Flying Club as an instructor and worked there until it closed in 1939. On 18 August 1936 she flew a demonstration flight in front of spectators to prove her piloting abilities. On 30 December 1936 she circled her plane in a flypast over the funeral of Abkhazian communist leader Nestor Lakoba.\n\nMilitary career \nIn 1939, Avidzba joined the Military Medical Academy in Leningrad; when she heard that war was due to be declared she volunteered to transfer to the fighter aircraft training school in Perm. This transition required Avidzba to appeal to the military authorities in order to be transferred. From Perm she moved to the military air school in Engels.\n\nIn 1941, she was posted to the Finnish border, where she flew biplanes. In December 1942, Avidzba was posted to the Caucasus region, as a navigator in the 46th Guards Light Bomber Night Aviation Regiment of the 4th Air Army of the 2nd Belarusian Front \u2013 beginning her career in the Night Witches.

Both names translate literally to \"Japanese stringed instrument.\"\n\nAccording to Shint\u014d myth as written in the Kojiki, the yamatogoto played an important role in the origins of Japan itself. In the myth, Amaterasu, goddess of the sun, is insulted by her brother Susano-o no Mikoto and hides in a cave, refusing to emerge. The world is therefore plunged into darkness. Amaterasu is eventually coaxed out of her cave by the goddess Ame-no-Uzume, who performs a dance outside the cave, to music provided by the twanging of six hunting bows. Amused by the music, and by the entertained sounds of the other gods, Amaterasu leaves the cave and returns to the firmament. The six bows are lashed together to form an instrument, and the first wagon or yamatogoto is born.\n\nThe instrument's form has changed very little since the eighth century. Similar in shape to the more commonly known koto, the yamatogoto is narrower, as it has fewer strings. Bridges are made from the natural forks of tree branches, particularly maple trees, according to tradition. Unlike many instruments, the yamatogoto's strings are not arranged in a scale, from low to high pitch, but in a preset melodic sequence which is played in rhythmic patterns. Another common playing technique involves a quick glissando across all the strings, with all but the last string played immediately muted with the hand, thus allowing only the last string to resonate.\n\nToday, the instrument is used only in the Shint\u014d ceremonial/court music called gagaku, and even then it is not common. Nevertheless, its central role in Japanese mythology allows it to retain some reverence.\n\nReferences\nClark, Mitchell (2005). \"Sounds of the Silk Road: Musical Instruments of Asia.\" Boston: Museum of Fine Arts Publications.\n\nJapanese musical instruments\nZithers\nKagura\nSacred musical instruments\nGagaku", "machine_text": "Yamatogoto is a traditional Japanese stringed instrument that dates back to ancient Japan. It is also known as the Yamato-fue or simply the Goto. The instrument is played with a bow and has a unique sound that is soothing and calming. The Yamatogoto is typically made of paulownia wood and has six silk strings. It is approximately 70 cm long and 12 cm wide. The instrument has a hollow body and a flat top, which is where the strings are attached. Being an ancient instrument, its design has not changed much over time, although there are different variations of the instrument in different regions of Japan. The Yamatogoto has a unique playing technique. The player places the instrument horizontally on their lap and uses a bow to play the strings. The sound produced by the instrument is similar to that of a harp or a guitar. It can produce both high and low notes depending on how the strings are played. The Yamatogoto was used in traditional Japanese ceremonies and performances. It was often played during tea ceremonies, as well as in Noh, Kabuki, and other traditional performances. Today, the instrument is still used in traditional Japanese music and is popular among enthusiasts of traditional Japanese music. In recent years, the Yamatogoto has become popular in the West. It is now being played by musicians and enthusiasts all over the world. Many music schools and universities offer classes on the instrument, and there are also Yamatogoto festivals that celebrate the instrument's history and culture. In conclusion, the Yamatogoto is an important part of Japan's musical history. It is a unique and beautiful instrument that has been passed down through generations.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Spider (pulp fiction)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Spider is an American pulp-magazine hero of the 1930s and 1940s. The character was created by editor Harry Steeger and written by a variety of authors for 118 monthly issues of The Spider from 1933 to 1943. A 119th Spider novel manuscript, Slaughter Incorporated, had been completed but was not published until decades later. A complete list of all 119 Spider pulps in the original series is available online at fan sites.\n\nThe Spider sold well during the 1930s, and copies are valued by modern pulp magazine collectors. Hulse has stated \"Today, hero-pulp fans value The Spider more than any single-character magazine except for The Shadow and Doc Savage.\"\n\nBackground\n\nThe Spider was created in 1933 by Harry Steeger at Popular Publications as direct competition to Street and Smith Publications' vigilante hero, the Shadow. The Spider was millionaire playboy Richard Wentworth, who had served as a major in World War I, and was living in New York City unaffected by the financial deprivations of the Great Depression. The ninth pulp represents him as the last surviving member of a rich family.\n\nWentworth was easily identified as the Spider by his enemies in a number of earlier novels and was arrested by the police but quickly escaped. He adopted a disguise, Tito Caliepi, and associated aliases. The Spider's earliest costume consisted of a simple black domino mask, black hat, and cape. Later in the series, vampire-like makeup appeared, which was replaced with a face mask featuring grizzled hair and finally a hunchback. These were added to terrorize the criminal underworld, while the Spider dispensed his brand of violent vigilante justice. (Actor and comedian Harold Lloyd previously had used a similar mask, lank hair wig, and hunchback in the comedy film Dr. Jack (1922)). Utilizing his talent with a violin, Wentworth, posing as Caliepi, sometimes used begging as part of his disguise.\n\nAt other times, Wentworth also ventured into the underworld disguised as small-time hood Blinky McQuade in order to gain needed information. To Scotland Yard, Wentworth was known as Rupert Barton, who held a badge of Inspector for services rendered; by the fifth novel, he also held the rank of lieutenant in the FBI.\n\nWentworth, according to the fifth story, was 5'11\" tall, and had grey eyes and an old battle scar on his head that would flare up at times of great stress. He was an accomplished pianist and violinist, and he drove a Lancia. He could speak fluent Hindustani and so talk with Ram Singh in his own language, with little fear anyone else would understand what was being said. Page's Wentworth was also psychologically vulnerable and suffered \"frequent bouts of fear, self-doubt, despair and paranoia\".\n\nThe Spider stories often involved a bizarre menace to the country and a criminal conspiracy, and were often extremely violent, with the villains engaging in wanton slaughter of thousands as part of sometimes nationwide crime sprees: pulp magazine historian Ed Hulse notes that \"Spider novel death tolls routinely ran into the thousands\". The master criminal of the stories was usually unmasked only in the last few pages. The stories often ended with Wentworth killing the villains and stamping their corpses' foreheads with his \"Spider\" mark.\n\nThe first two novels were written by Reginald Thomas Maitland Scott (aka R.T.M. Scott), but they were deemed too slow-paced, so another author was brought in. Later stories were published under the house pen name of \"Grant Stockbridge\". Most of the Spider novels were actually written by Norvell Page. Other authors of the series included Donald C. Cormack, Wayne Rogers, Emile C. Tepperman, and Prentice Winchell.\n\nThe cover artists for The Spider magazine were Walter M. Baumhofer for the debut issue, followed by John Newton Howitt and Rafael De Soto. The Spider was published monthly and ran for 118 issues from 1933 to 1943. A 119th Spider novel manuscript (Slaughter Incorporated) had been completed but was not published until decades later (as Blue Steel), a heavily rewritten mass-market paperback with renamed characters (see paperback novels section below). (In 2012, Moonstone Books finally published it as Slaughter, Inc., in its original unedited form. The novel was once again reprinted in 2018 by Altus Press as a facsimile edition, this time designed to look exactly like the actual Spider #119 pulp would have looked in the 1940s.)\n\nThe Spider sold well during the 1930s, and copies are still valued by modern pulp magazine collectors. Hulse has stated \"Today, hero-pulp fans value The Spider more than any single-character magazine save The Shadow and Doc Savage.\"\n\nSupporting characters\nNita Van Sloan, is Wentworth's longtime fianc\u00e9e, who often aided him. Though they are as close as man and wife, they know they could never marry and have a family, as Wentworth believes he will eventually be unmasked or killed as The Spider, and his wife and family would then pay the price. In the issue #100 story, \"Death and The Spider\", Wentworth expected to die. Nita disguises herself as The Spider a few times, covering for Wentworth when he has been seriously injured.\n\nRam Singh, a Sikh (originally Hindu), is Wenthworth's fanatically loyal manservant; he is a deadly knife thrower and usually carries several knives with him, including the deadly kukri. Ram Singh never views his position as a servant as demeaning or negatively impacting his self-respect, feeling that he serves a man totally above other men. At times, he and Wentworth talk in Hindustani, which only they understand.\n\nSergeant Ronald Jackson, Wentworth's chauffeur, had served under Wentworth in World War I and often referred to him as \"the Major\". He was killed by \"The Avenger\" in The Pain Emperor story (Feb 1935). However he was revived in \"The Reign of the Death Fiddler\" (May 1, 1935) when it was revealed that though near death, Ram Singh had saved him and brought him back to full health again.\n\nHarold Jenkyns is Wentworth's butler, an elderly man who has been in the Wentworth family's service for a long time.\n\nPolice Commissioner Stanley Kirkpatrick or simply \"Kirk\", is Wentworth's main ally/antagonist, who is sure Wentworth is The Spider but can never prove it. He has promised to arrest him, try him, and send him to the electric chair if he ever has proof.\n\nProfessor Ezra Brownlee, an inventor and Wentworth's old war colleague, features heavily in the early Spider novels; he is killed in Dragon Lord of the Underworld (July 1935). Brownlee's son makes some appearances afterward, taking over from his late father.\n\nEnemies\nDespite The Spider's tendency to kill his enemies, he encounters several foes more than once, such as The Fly and MUNRO, a master of disguise. Some storylines featuring a struggle against a single villain lasted for several consecutive issues, such as The Spider's four-part battle against Tang-Akhmut, the Living Pharaoh (issues #36, 37, 38 and 39), and The Spider's three-part battle against The Master and his Black Police (#60, 61 and 62), which was reprinted decades later in a single volume as The Spider vs The Empire State. Other enemies he encountered had names like the costumed super-villains of comic books, such as Judge Torture, Red Feather, The Bloody Serpent, The Brain, The Emperor of Vermin, The Red Mandarin, The Silencer, and The Wreck.  The names of two Spider villains, The Bat Man and The Iron Man, were later adopted for DC and Marvel comic book superheroes.\n\nThe Spider's seal and weapons\nOne of The Spider's distinguishing features is his \"calling card.\" Wentworth often leaves a red-ink \"spider\" image (like a drop of blood) on the foreheads of the criminals he kills, so others will not be blamed. In the sixth novel (1934), the Spider imprints his red sign on a gold ring so that any who need his help can use it by taking it to Kirkpatrick (where Wentworth will find out about it). During the same time period, in the same benign fashion, and perhaps inspired by The Spider's calling card, Lee Falk's long-running 1936 syndicated comic strip hero, The Phantom, left a distinct skull mark in the faces of those enemies he fought, made by the ring he wore. The Spider's seal, however, was concealed in the base of his platinum cigarette lighter and was invented by Professor Brownlee. The Spider also carried a thin silken line (his \"web\") which had a tensile strength of several hundred pounds.\n\nBrownlee also invented the lethal and almost silent air pistol the Spider used for \"quiet\" kills. He acted as a sort of on-call weaponsmith for Wentworth, whom he looked upon as being close to a son. Wentworth also had a gun in one of his shoes, which he used twice in the 5th novel.\n\nWentworth was also a master of disguise. In the small steel case of burglar tools he carried under his arm, he also had his make-up kit and (in the early novels) his Spider's eye mask.\n\nIn Timothy Truman's 1990s comic book adaptation, Brownlee created the \"Web-Lee\", a non-lethal stun pistol that fired projectiles which erupted into a spider web-like mass, inundated with microscopic barbs of frozen curare.\n\nLike The Shadow, The Spider's usual weapons of choice were a pair of Browning .45 caliber M1911 automatic pistols; he was a crack shot and normally shot to kill. However, he would not shoot anyone in law enforcement, although they frequently were under orders to shoot to kill him on sight.\n\nMaster of Men\nThe Spider's by-name was \"Master of Men\", indicating that he had a voice commanding enough to get many people to do his bidding. Wentworth could also imitate other people's voices. When he imitated Kirkpatrick's voice, he could give orders to lesser policemen during a stakeout, even during one intended to capture The Spider, so he could himself escape. Wentworth was not above disguising himself as a cop to escape when surrounded by policemen.\n\nMovie serials\nColumbia Pictures produced two Spider movie serials, both 15-chapter cliffhangers starring Warren Hull as Richard Wentworth. The first, The Spider's Web (1938), was also the first film serial to be made from a popular pulp magazine series character. In this serial The Spider battles The Octopus and his henchmen who attempt to disrupt all commercial and passenger transportation systems, and later all U. S. industry; Spider pulp magazine novelist Norvell Page was one of the writers who worked on the serial's screenplay.\n\nIn the second serial, The Spider Returns (1941), The Spider battles the mysterious crime lord The Gargoyle and his henchmen, who threaten the world with acts of sabotage and wholesale murder in an effort to wreck the U. S. national defense.\n\nBoth serials feature a dramatic wardrobe enhancement to The Spider's magazine appearance: his black cape and head mask are over-printed with a white spider's web pattern and then matched with his usual plain black fedora. This striking addition gave the silver screen Spider an appearance more like that of a traditional superhero, like other pulp and comics heroes being adapted for the era's movie serials; it also made the serial Spider look less like the very popular Street and Smith pulp hero The Shadow, which was also produced as a serial by Columbia Pictures.\n\nNovel reprints\n\nFor a complete list of all 119 Spider pulps in the original series, see this site: http://spiderreturns.com/pulps/list.html\n\nMany, if not all, of the original 118 (technically, 119) Spider pulp magazine novels have been reprinted over the years in both mass-market paperback and trade paperback editions or some other form. Very few attempts have been made however to publish the novels in chronological order, making it difficult for collectors to read them in the order in which they originally appeared.\n \nBerkley Books (then Berkley/Medallion) first reprinted the Spider in 1969 and 1970, intending to reprint all 118 novels in order, hoping to tap into the reprint phenomenon of the Doc Savage novels being published by Bantam Books. However, these first paperback reissues met with poor sales after reprinting only the first four volumes (#1, 2, 3 and 4 in the original pulp series), and the planned series was canceled. \n \nIn the mid-1970s Pocket Books reprinted four Spider novels (originally published as pulps #16, 21, 26 and 100), featuring \"modernized\" pulp cover artwork by Robert A. Maguire. In this series, The Spider (renamed simply \"Spider\") was portrayed as a non-costumed, heavily armed muscular blond-haired hero (similar to James Bond). These paperbacks also failed to sell, and the series was canceled. These four novels were re-edited and heavily modernized so the stories didn't faithfully reprint the original pulp tales, one of several reasons why they may have never caught on with their intended audience. In the reprint of Death and the Spider for example (originally published as pulp #100 in 1942), Nita Van Sloan is shown driving a Jaguar E-type X-KE, a sports car not created until 1961, some 19 years later.\n\nAt roughly the same time in England, Mews Books/New American Library reprinted the same four Spider novels (#16, 21, 26 and 100) sporting entirely new cover art, but different in style and execution from those used by Pocket Books. Also called \"Spider\", this character also resembled a non-costumed James Bond-type character (only with black hair instead of blonde). This British Spider mass market series also ended after the four titles were released. \n \nAn unusual Spider publishing event happened right \"out of the blue\" in 1979. Python Publishing published the never-before-seen last original Spider novel, Slaughter, Inc. (written by Donald G. Cormack), which was originally scheduled to have been published in 1944 as The Spider #119. Python published it as a one-shot mass market paperback in 1979. For copyright reasons, all of the characters' names were changed, the story was retitled Blue Steel: The Ultimate Answer To Evil, and the author was credited as \"Spider Page\" (no doubt a sly reference to the novel's original author, Norvell Page). The Spider was recast in this book as a character named \"Blue Steel\". As with Pocket Books' modernized \"Spider\" editions, this paperback sported a modernized pulp cover painting featuring a non-costumed, but heavily armed, blond-haired hero (said to be an unused cover painting by artist George Gross, produced but never used for a Freeway Press reprint of another pulp magazine character, Operator No. 5). In 2012, Moonstone Books finally published the unpublished 119th Spider novel Slaughter, Inc. in its original unedited form. The novel was reprinted yet again in 2018 by Altus Press as a \"facsimile edition\", this time designed to look exactly how The Spider #119 pulp would have looked had it been published in 1944.\n \nIn 1980 Dimedia, Inc. (aka Pulp Press) reprinted three Spider pulp novels (#9, 10 and 11) in the larger trade paperback format. In 1984, they reprinted those same three novels again as mass market paperbacks, sporting brand new cover paintings of the original costumed Spider by artists Ken Kelly (on volumes one and two) and Frank Kelly Freas (on volume three).\n \nIn the early 1990s Carroll & Graf Publishers issued a series of eight mass market Spider paperbacks, each one reprinting two complete Spider novels. These 16 novels became the longest-running Spider reprint series done for the mass market paperback book market up to that time. The novels reprinted in this series were #14, 15, 17, 26, 30, 40, 41, 50, 52, 54, 75, 76, 78, 81, 92 and 113.  All of them used the original The Spider pulp magazine artwork for their covers. (One cover was a newly done painting by Rafael DeSoto, the original pulp cover artist.)\n\nAfter Carroll & Graf, several specialized small press pulp reprint houses tried their hand at reprinting The Spider series. Bold Venture Press published ten issues of The Spider (#'s 5, 6, 7, 8, 16, 26, 31, 50, 69 and 70). Wildside Press published two The Spider reprints (#'s 78 and 92).\n\nPulp Adventure Press (PAP) reprinted 12 Spider novels in a magazine-sized format, even including the original interior artwork from the pulps  (they reprinted #'s 12, 31, 36, 37, 38, 39, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48 and 85).\n\nGirasol Collectibles (aka Adventure House) has been the most dogged of them all. They have reissued the novels as both a series of single pulp novel facsimile editions, as well as re-typeset stories in \"pulp double novel\" trade paperbacks. Both series use the original pulp magazine cover artwork for their books. Girasol published the first 23 issues of the original pulp series as \"facsimile\" editions. They also published 25 of their \"double-novel format\" issues, which totalled 50 novels reprinted in all (#'s 1, 3, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 19, 20, 22, 25, 27, 28, 29, 32, 34, 35, 42, 43, 49, 51, 53, 54, 55, 57, 59, 64, 66, 70, 71, 72, 77, 82, 83, 86, 87, 91, 95, 98, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 107, 108, 110, 112 and 114.)\n \nIn 2007, New York science fiction publisher Baen Books published a trade paperback featuring three Spider novel reprints (#16, 74 and 85). In 2008, they released a second companion trade paperback featuring 2 more Spider reprints (#26 and 75) as well as a third bonus story about another pulp hero called \"The Octopus\". In 2009, Baen re-issued both volumes as mass market paperbacks. The Baen editions sported brand new Spider cover paintings by noted graphic designer and comics artist Jim Steranko. (In 1970, for Pyramid Books and HBJ/Jove Books, Steranko had illustrated 27 (of 28 covers) for their mass market novel re-issues of rival pulp hero \"The Shadow\" (with the exception of the cover for Mobsmen On The Spot which re-used a George Rozen original Shadow pulp magazine cover). Steranko also illustrated additional new covers for five of \"The Shadow\" novels' second printings.)\n\nAlso in 2007, Moonstone Books published an original anthology of brand new Spider short story pastiches entitled The Spider Chronicles. In 2013, Moonstone published a second anthology, The Spider: Extreme Prejudice featuring 12 more brand new Spider short story pastiches.\n\nIn late 2009, Doubleday's Science Fiction Book Club reprinted (in hardcover) Baen's second Spider three-in-one volume from the previous year. This became the first Spider hardcover edition ever to be published.\n\nIn August 2009, Age of Aces reprinted The Spider's Black Police trilogy in a single volume which they titled \"The Spider vs. The Empire State\". This trilogy consisted of three 1938 issues that were connected plotwise... #60 (September 1938), #61 (October 1938) and #62 (November, 1938).\n\nIn October 2012, Moonstone Books published an original Spider pastiche novel, Shadow of Evil, by C. J. Henderson.\n\nIn 2013, Sanctum Books reprinted 20 Spider novels in ten \"double novel issues\". Each book contained two reprinted novels. The pulps Sanctum reprinted were # 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 16, 17, 18, 30, 31, 68, 74, 78, 90, 92, 93, 96, 106, 111 and 118.\n\nThe Vintage Library has 34 licensed Spider novel reprints available in the PDF format. For a small fee, each one can be downloaded from their website.\n\nFacsimile Spider novels continue to appear in print from other publishers, especially Altus Press; they have also been issued in the Kindle e-book format.\n\nAltus Press has recently begun reprinting the entire Spider series of novels in their original order of publication beginning with #1, the books being currently issued on a monthly basis. Altus also launched (in August, 2018) a \"Wild Adventures of The Spider\" pastiche novel series. The first pastiche was written by Will Murray. The Doom Legion saw Richard Wentworth team up with James Christopher (aka \"Operator 5\") and \"G-8\", two of Popular Publications' top pulp heroes. A pastiche sequel, Fury in Steel by Will Murray came out in 2021.\n\nSpider comics and graphic novels\nIn the early 1990s, The Spider and its characters were reinterpreted in comic book form by Timothy Truman for Eclipse Comics. As noted in Comics Scene #19, Truman set his version of The Spider in the \"1990s as seen by the 1930s\". Elements of this version of The Spider's milieu included airships as common transportation, the survival of the League of Nations into the near past (Wentworth meets Ram Singh during an intervention into India/Pakistan), and World War II, if it ever happened, taking place differently. This series featured an African-American Commissioner Kirkpatrick.\n\nMoonstone Books started a new Spider graphic novel series, in which installments are structured more like illustrated prose stories than traditional panel-by-panel comics. In March 2011, the same publisher offered the first issue of a more traditional Spider comic book, with art by veteran creator Pablo Marcos.\n\nIn August 2011, Dynamite Entertainment announced that they were going to produce a brand new, updated Spider comic book series, written by novelist David Liss; the first issue was released in May 2012. The Spider's costume in this series is based on the one worn by actor Warren Hull in Columbia's 1940s Spider movie serials, but the black costume's web lines are rendered in blood red instead of white. This comics series depicts The Spider and his allies fighting crime in a modern-day U. S. In 2013, Dynamite announced that issue #18 of The Spider would be its last.\n\nIn December 2012, Dynamite released the first issue of Masks, an eight-issue comic book miniseries that teams The Spider with Dynamite's other pulp hero-based comic book characters, including: the Green Hornet and Kato, The Shadow, and a 1930s descendant of Zorro, among others. Together, they fight a powerful criminal syndicate, which, along with its gangster henchmen, secretly controls New York City through the corrupt and powerful Justice Party, which has seized complete control over the city and its citizens. This miniseries, set in the Depression Era of the 1930s, is not in the same universe/story continuity as Dynamite's main Spider comic book series. The story is based on The Spider Magazine novels \"The City That Paid To Die\", \"The Spider at Bay\", and \"Scourge of the Black Legions\" all written by Norvell Page. Page was not credited in this adaption. The completed Masks miniseries was then gathered by Dynamite into a one-volume graphic novel.\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\nBarbour, Alan G.

Created by writer Harry Steeger, Spider was a crime-fighting vigilante who used his immense strength and intelligence to combat evil in Depression-era America. The character's real name was Richard Wentworth, a wealthy playboy who became Spider to avenge the death of his beloved fianc\u00e9e. Spider's adventures were published in the pulp magazine, \"The Spider,\" which was hugely popular in its time. The character was known for his signature outfit which consisted of a red cape, a slouch hat, a black opera mask, and a black suit. Spider was also known for his use of clever disguises and gadgets to outsmart his enemies. The Spider fought a wide range of villains, including corrupt politicians, dangerous gangsters, and mysterious cult leaders. His adventures featured a high level of violence and action, and often involved solving intricate mysteries. The Spider became an iconic character in the pulp fiction genre, with 118 issues of \"The Spider\" being published between 1933 and 1943. The character was also adapted into comic books and a film series. In recent years, the character has gained renewed popularity among fans of pulp fiction. Reprints of the original stories have been released, and new Spider stories have been written by contemporary authors. Spider was a trailblazing character in the pulp fiction genre, known for his mercurial personality and his larger-than-life adventures. He remains a beloved figure in popular culture, and his influence can be seen in countless crime-fighting vigilantes and superheroes that have come after him.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 649269}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"German submarine U-546\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "German submarine U-546 was a Type IXC/40 U-boat operated by Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine during World War II. She was laid down at the Deutsche Werft in Hamburg as yard number 367 on 6 August 1942, launched on 17 March 1943 and commissioned on 2 June 1943 under Oberleutnant zur See Paul Just. The U-boat was a member of three wolfpacks.\n\nU-546 was responsible for the last combat sinking of a United States Navy vessel in the Atlantic Theatre, during Operation Teardrop. On 24 April 1945 U-546 sank the destroyer escort , but was in turn sunk by combined fire of five other US destroyers. Her captain and most of her crew were rescued by US vessels, and taken to Argentia Naval Station. It was from this crew that the USN eventually learned that no V-1/2 attacks from the U-boats were planned by the Kriegsmarine.\n\nDesign\nGerman Type IXC/40 submarines were slightly larger than the original Type IXCs. U-546 had a displacement of  when at the surface and  while submerged. The U-boat had a total length of , a pressure hull length of , a beam of , a height of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two MAN M 9 V 40/46 supercharged four-stroke, nine-cylinder diesel engines producing a total of  for use while surfaced, two Siemens-Schuckert 2 GU 345/34 double-acting electric motors producing a total of  for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two  propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to .\n\nThe submarine had a maximum surface speed of  and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for  at ; when surfaced, she could travel  at . U-546 was fitted with six  torpedo tubes (four fitted at the bow and two at the stern), 22 torpedoes, one  SK C/32 naval gun, 180 rounds, and a  SK C/30 as well as a  C/30 anti-aircraft gun. The boat had a complement of forty-eight.\n\nSensors\n\nRadar\nU-546 was one of the few U-boats that was fitted with a FuMO 61 Hohentwiel U Radar Transmitter. It was installed on the starboard side of the conning tower.\n\nRadar Detection\nU-546 was fixed with the FuMB-26 Tunis antenne. The FuMB 26 Tunis combined the FuMB Ant. 24 Fliege and FuMB Ant. 25 Cuba II antennas. It could be mounted in either the Direction Finder Antenna Loop and separately on the bridge.\n\nService history\n\nShe commenced her training on 2 June 1943, making her first silent run at S\u00f8nderborg, she remained with the 4th U-boat Flotilla (training) at Stettin until 31 December 1943. She completed her training with a voyage from Hela to Swinem\u00fcnde to practice A.A. cannon fire.\n\nFirst patrol\nThe boat was reassigned to the 10th U-boat Flotilla for combat duties in the Atlantic on 1 January 1944, departing Kiel on 22 January 1944, with a three-day stopover at Marvika in Norway. After forming up with the Gruppe Igel 1 (Group Hedgehog) north-west of Scotland on 3 February 1944, U-546 commenced a patrol in the North Atlantic with other boats to the west of Ireland on anti-convoy duties. At 12:29 on 16 February U-546 reported she had been attacked by a British Sunderland flying boat from No. 201 Squadron RAF, killing one crewman. On 20 February 1944 she was again attacked by an aircraft. On 17 April while returning to base in France, the U-boat was caught on the surface by a Leigh light -equipped Liberator of 53 Squadron in the Bay of Biscay, steaming south-east, ahead of convoy HX 278 and was attacked with depth charges, but ended up shooting down the attacker with the 3.7\u00a0cm gun. She returned to Lorient for service and refit on 23 or 25 April 1944. The crew was given leave while the boat was overhauled and the Schnorchel was fitted.\n\nSecond patrol\nLeaving her base again on 15 June 1944 for her second patrol to the African Gold Coast, she was detected by a USN anti-submarine patrol, which begun to hunt her. She soon had to abort her patrol and was ordered to return to Germany after the invasion of Normandy. On 18 June 1944 U-546 was attacked, again by a Sunderland, which was not equipped with radar. The boat then briefly returned to France on 22 June to replenish her cannon ammunition, sailing again on 25 June. On 20 July 1944 she was detected by USN surface ships forming the escort for an escort carrier; U-546 fired a torpedo at the carrier, but missed and was subjected to three hours of depth charge attacks from the escort destroyers. She managed to escape this attack. U-546 was then ordered to patrol a zone near Cape Verde where she operated for about four weeks, attacking a convoy with a spread of three torpedoes, but scoring no hits.\n\nDuring the second patrol due to fuel shortages the captain achieved significant fuel saving and extended the cruise to 150 days (the boat's longest patrol), by floating submerged for days on water-layers with all engines stopped. The boat returned to base with 30 metric tons of fuel left.\n\nThird patrol\nOn 10 November 1944 U-546 was reassigned to the 33rd U-boat Flotilla based at Flensburg, where she received a 14-day overhaul, eventually departing Kristiansand in Norway, on 2 March 1945. The boat proceeded to the eastern coast of North America on 10 March 1945 with six companions. In mid-April the group was ordered to commence operations individually. On 23 April the submarine was spotted surfacing north-west of the Azores by aircraft from  as part of Operation Teardrop. The planes were looking for U-boats carrying V-1 flying bombs and V-2 rockets, which intelligence suggested were going to be used to attack American cities. Depth charges were dropped just after the boat submerged, but failed to damage her hull.\n\nSinking\n\nOn 24 April 1945, U-546 made contact with the destroyer escort  and proceeded to attack, firing a stern torpedo. The destroyer turned into it and was hit, which tore the DE apart and sent her down with heavy loss of life.\n\nThe U-boat was in turn pursued by other destroyer escorts; , , , , ,  , , and . Neunzer and  conducted a search while Pillsbury circled the area and Flaherty picked up survivors. Flaherty made contact in less than an hour and with Pillsbury proceeded to attack. The U-boat went to . Contact was lost from 10:45 until 12:01 when Varian, Janssen and Hubbard began another attack. Neunzer got into the fight after several attacks by the other DE's, delivering a creeping attack with Varian and Hubbard while Chatelain directed. Contact was lost once more at about 16:00, so Chatelain and Neunzer were ordered to return to the scouting line.\n\nThe line was expanded, the ships began a sweep through the area, determined to prevent the submarine's escape. Varian made contact once more at 17:31 and Flaherty was ordered to attack. She fired at 18:10. Four minutes later a small oil slick began coming to the surface. Flaherty made another Hedgehog attack at 18:28, and at 18:38 the U-boat broke the surface.\n\nEvery ship in the line within range began firing. At 18:44, after more than ten and a half hours of attacks, U-546 rolled under and sank (in position , south-south-east of Cape Farewell, Greenland). Her captain and most of her crew were rescued by US vessels, and taken to Argentia Naval Station, Newfoundland. Eight of the surviving, captured crewmen of U-546 were tortured by US military personnel. Historian Philip K. Lundeberg has written that the beating and torture of U-546's survivors was a singular atrocity motivated by the interrogators' need to quickly get information on what the U.S. believed were potential cruise missile or ballistic missile attacks on the continental US by German submarines.

She was built by Deutsche Werft AG in Hamburg and commissioned on 4 November 1943 under the command of Kapit\u00e4nleutnant Paul Just. U-546's first and only patrol began on 5 April 1945, when she departed from Kiel, Germany. Her mission was to intercept and sink Allied ships in the North Atlantic. However, her patrol was cut short when she was spotted and attacked by a United States Navy aircraft on 24 April 1945. The plane damaged the submarine's bridge, conning tower and engines, forcing U-546 to surface. Once surfaced, the submarine was immediately fired upon by the USS Frederick C. Davis, USS Holder, and USS Chatelain. U-546 was hit by multiple depth charges and torpedoes and began to sink. Survivors abandoned the vessel and were rescued by the US Navy ships. Of the 58 crew members, only 10 survived the attack and were taken as prisoners of war. The American search teams boarded the sinking U-546 and found a gold bar, jewels, and other items believed to be stolen from German civilians. It's believed the valuables were stolen by the U-boat's crew during an Italian mission to deliver valuable Nazi plunder to Japan. In 1995, a joint expedition by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and the National Geographic Society discovered the wreck of U-546, located off the coast of Maine, USA. The discovery provided an opportunity to study the submarine and offer insights into the underwater warfare of World War II.

The University is a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I. The school primarily competes in the Horizon League, but competes in other conferences for fencing and lacrosse, sports not sponsored for either men or women by the Horizon League. Fencing, a co-ed sport, competes in the Midwest Fencing Conference. Men's lacrosse moved from the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference to the ASUN Conference in July 2021. Women's lacrosse joined the Mid-American Conference for that league's first women's lacrosse season in 2021.\n\nTeams\nA member of the Horizon League, Detroit Mercy sponsors 17 NCAA varsity teams (seven men's, eight women's, and one coed NCAA-sanctioned sports). Detroit Mercy is one of only 4 NCAA Division I schools that sponsors neither volleyball nor baseball (the other 3 being Boston University, Drexel, and Vermont). Previously the Tigers, in either 1919 or 1924 the school adopted the Titans nickname.\n\nNotes\n\nSports\n\nBasketball, men's\n\nOn June 13, 2018, Detroit Mercy named Mike Davis the 22nd head coach in men\u2019s basketball program history. The NCAA Tournament-tested Davis previously coached at Texas Southern University, where he led the team to four regular season titles, four conference tournament championships and four NCAA Tournament appearances. He led Indiana University to the 2002 NCAA Championship game.\n\nStarring for the Titans is Davis\u2019 son, Antoine Davis. In his debut season in 2018-19, Antoine Davis broke the NCAA Division I freshman record for 3-point field goals made in a season, previously held by NBA star Stephen Curry.\n\nFormer head coach Ray McCallum led Detroit Mercy to the Horizon League Championship during the 2011-12 season, granting the Titans an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament. Detroit Mercy received a 15 seed and lost to the University of Kansas in the tournament's second round.\n\nMcCallum's predecessor Perry Watson led a successful program at Detroit's Southwestern High School and served as an assistant coach at the University of Michigan before coming to Detroit Mercy and maintained strong recruiting ties within the city's public league. After 14 seasons Watson stepped down as head coach at the end of the 2007\u20132008 season. Watson guided Detroit Mercy to 10 winning seasons, three league titles, two NCAA Tournament appearances and an NIT Final Four. The Titans two NCAA appearances also included victories over St. John's and UCLA. Between 1997\u201398 and 2000\u201301, the Titans had four straight 20-victory seasons.\n\nDick Vitale, ESPN's most well-known college basketball commentator, was the Detroit men's basketball head coach for four seasons (1973\u20131977) before becoming the school's athletic director in 1977. The following year he left to coach the Detroit Pistons.

The program went through turmoil in what proved to be Gilbert's only season.\n\nDuring the 2020\u201321 season, extensively affected by COVID-19, Detroit Mercy was one of several Division I programs that canceled its season early, but the only one that did so for reasons unrelated to the pandemic. On January 17, 2021, the parents of all 14 players on the roster sent a letter to athletic director Robert Vowels Jr. alleging NCAA rules violations, as well as rampant emotional and physical abuse, by Gilbert. After an internal investigation, Detroit Mercy retained Gilbert, but after all 14 players on the 2020\u201321 roster left the program, Gilbert resigned on June 15, with assistant Collins taking over on an interim basis.\n\nGilbert\u2019s predecessor, Bernard Scott, led the Titans to 33 wins in his first two seasons, including a trip to the Horizon League championship game at Joe Louis Arena in 2016-17. His contract was not renewed following the 2019-20 season.\n\nScott took over for Autumn Rademacher, a former star guard at Detroit Mercy. Rademacher coached the Titans from 2008-2015, guiding the team to 89 victories, including a 20-win season in 2011-12 and appearances in the Women's National Invitation Tournament (WNIT) and Women's Basketball Invitational (WBI) National Tournament. In 2010\u201311, Rademacher led Detroit Mercy to a win over in-state rival and Big Ten member Michigan. The victory not only ended a six-game losing streak to Michigan, it was the first triumph over the Wolverines \u2013 as well as against the Big Ten \u2013 since 1994.\n\nLacrosse, men's\nThe Detroit Mercy men's lacrosse team, coached by Matt Holtz, won the 2013 MAAC Championship and advanced to the NCAA tournament, where they were downed in the fourth quarter by Notre Dame.\n\nFootball (discontinued)\n\nThe first attempt at a football team for the University of Detroit was known as the Detroit Heralds. That team was disbanded after the 1904 season, and most of the players formed an amateur team of the same name in 1905. Although the university team returned in 1906, the amateur team remained, eventually evolving into a semi-professional team, then a professional team, ultimately joining the National Football League as a charter member in 1920. The Heralds folded in 1921.\n\nIn 1928, the Detroit Titans under Gus Dorais finished with a record of 9-0-0. Several years later Parke H.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Heirs of Empire\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Heirs of Empire is a 1996 military science fiction novel by American writer David Weber. It is the third novel in the Dahak trilogy, after the de facto duology of Mutineers' Moon and The Armageddon Inheritance. Heirs of Empire is a stand-alone work that focuses on the adventures and travails of the fraternal twin children of Emperor Colin MacIntyre (who defeated the eponymous mutineers and the Achuultani incursion in  The Armageddon Inheritance) and their three friends. In 2003, it was republished in the omnibus volume, Empire from the Ashes.\n\nPlot summary \n\nThe story opens approximately 20 years after The Armageddon Inheritance. The human race has largely recovered from the Siege of Earth by the Achuultani and the Bia system is being slowly re-colonized and its defenses re-activated. In short, the Empire is largely at peace, busy assimilating the technological advances of the Fourth Empire and building and manning a fleet to take the war back to the Achuultani and the master computer controlling them. The captured Achuultani have prospered; with the aid of cloning, their ranks have swollen and they have colonized a planet called Narhan, which was unsuitable to humans by reason of its heavy gravity - for this reason they have renamed themselves the Narhani. They are fervently loyal to the reborn Empire and Colin, enraged by the perversion of their race by the master computer. Brashieel's clone-child (Brashieel is now the head Narhani) Brashan, is one of Sean and Harriet MacIntyre's closest friends (Sean and Harriet being Colin and Jiltanith's two children).\n\nThe only flies in the ointment are the worrying fact that some of Anu's agents remain at large, and that a small but increasingly violent faction that considers the Narhani to be minions of the anti-christ and want to kill all Narhani; these two factions are secretly working against the Emperor.\n\nInto this volatile situation step Sean, Harry, Brashan, Sandy (daughter of Hector MacMahan and Ninhursag), and Tamman (the son of Amanda Tsien and Tamman), who have all enlisted in Battle Fleet.\n\nAfter graduation from the Academy, the four depart on a newly constructed planetoid warship, Imperial Terra, for their midshipman cruise. Unbeknownst to them, one of Anu's former minions, Lawrence Jefferson, had worked his way up to Lieutenant Governor of Earth, and has commenced his plan to become Emperor through assassinating everyone ahead of him in the line of succession. Under his instructions, Jefferson's personal band of religious terrorists, \"The Sword of God\", takes one of the planetoid's programmer's family hostage, and order him to sabotage Imperial Terra. The task is accomplished, and the programmer and his family are all murdered to cover it up.\n\nThe Imperial Terra departs on its maiden voyage, but partway through deliberately loses control of its core tap, as the dead programmer had instructed. However, Dahak had surreptitiously inserted a command with equal priority to the sabotage command which states that the lives of 2 certain midshipmen and their friends must be preserved. Imperial Terra reconciles these conflicting orders by first jettisoning the four aboard a well-stocked and capable (but not FTL-capable) battleship moderately near some uncharted systems and only then destroying itself and its crew of 80 thousand.\n\nLater, Sandy, Harry, Brashan, Sean, and Tamman arrive at the nearest potentially inhabited system. They barely survive the onslaught of a quarantine system, and decide to sneak onto the life-bearing world the space-borne Imperial weaponry seem to be protecting.  Amazingly, it seems that the bio-weapon that had killed the Fourth Empire had missed this world.\n\nAfter landing and investigating the ruins of a high-tech enclave, the five piece together the true history of the planet the indigenous inhabitants call \"Pardal\".\n\nOnce, Pardal had been an out-of-the-way minor planet of the Empire. Because it was out of the way, its governor managed to shut down the mat-trans system before Pardal was infected by the bio-weapon when the first warnings went out across the hypercoms, and also to devise with her chief engineer an extremely effective quarantine system. However, even as they hunkered down behind their orbital defenses, the hypercom  continued to operate \"like a comlink to hell\" (pg 255), broadcasting the prolonged death of the Empire, and even more devastatingly, messages from worlds like Pardal which were fooled by the bio-weapon's long incubation period into thinking they were safe. The horrified backlash by Pardal's populace centered on destroying Pardal's technological infrastructure, and erasing all scientific accomplishment and knowledge more advanced than the Dark Ages, so another such horror could never arise. The civil and military authorities concentrated on creating a global theocracy (reminiscent of the Catholic Church) dedicated to the suppression of technological advancement and to the maintenance of the quarantine system.\n\nThe high-tech enclave the old records were retrieved from was permitted to exist to serve as a source of demons and to provide the fledgling church an easy enemy.\n\nHarriet had been sent back to the shuttle to bring it to the valley so they could airlift the enclave's computer out, but along the way she was shot down by some locals. They were about to burn her alive for associating with the \"Valley of the Damned\" when Sean and the rest, frightened them and destroyed a portion of the village (without killing anyone) and rescuing her.\n\nThe local priest becomes convinced that the intruders were actually angels, as Pardalian angels are female, beautiful, wound-able, speak in the language of the Empire (the priestly language on Pardal), killed no one (an odd restraint, were they \"damned demons\"), wore imperial military uniforms, and were immune to Father Stomald's various religious attacks and banishments. He begins preaching to the populace, converting a fair proportion.\n\nThe Church reacts quickly and violently, sending a portion of the very well equipped \"Temple Guard\" to burn the heretics.\n\nStomald's forces are outnumbered and outgunned (the Church possesses a monopoly on heavy artillery) and surely doomed. The five castaways discuss matters, and decide that their guilt in instigating this little rebellion, kickstarting the modernization of Pardal, and also gaining access they need to the quarantine system's main computer could all be accomplished by supporting the rebellion with their leadership and knowledge of how to revolutionize Pardalian warfare. The initial Guard expedition is repulsed and scattered by a miracle accomplished through Imperial technology (see Clarke's Third Law). This victory attracts even more recruits to their cause, such as a good proportion of the now-unarmed Guard force they defeated.\n\nThe quasi-country the revolt began in, the Princedom of Malagor, has long been known for its independent spirit and its rifles; it had long chafed under the Church's studied oppression of it and its artisans. With the new rifles (on Pardal, smoothbore guns and pikes made up most of an army. Rifles took far too long to load despite their greater accuracy and range, because balls had to be rammed down the barrel; with the \"angels\"' introduction of the Mini\u00e9 ball, this issue became moot) the army is considerably superior to conventional Pardalian armies. Other technology, such as bayonet rings, modern meteorology, satellite cartography, and canister shot, further increase the rebels advantage .\n\nThe Battle of Yortown, in which the massed Guard reinforcements charged a fortified Angel's army position, quite effectively demonstrated this through the slaughter of the aggressors. Sean's lack of boldness in the counter-stroke followup allowed the surviving Guard commander, named Ortak, to retreat to Erastor, a well-fortified position placed like a choke-point between Malagor and the Temple. Unfortunately, Sean's many advantages are largely nullified in a siege, so he conceives a strike to Ortak's rear, seizing Ortak's semaphore communication lines to perform a man in the middle attack and gain time. Sean managed to bring enough men around Ortak's impassable swamp-secured flank to launch a pincer attack on Ortak's rear and front. With Ortak's forces shattered, the Angels' Army moves out into the open country of Aris, where they can bypass fortifications and crush any  army foolish enough to engage.\n\nThey march clear to the Temple, but are stymied by its elaborate fortifications.  Sean's army is ideal for defeating other armies, but not for fighting a siege. The Council offers to meet with Sean to discuss a truce, offering as surety one of its own members and allowing Sean to bring a large contingent in with him. Sean walks straight into their trap, and begins fighting his way to the actual Template/computer complex with his men, while Sandy and the others task the main army with breaking in to relieve Sean.  Brashan circles the conflict 100 kilometers away in the Imperial equivalent of a fighter jet, unable to do anything while the quarantine system's defense guns are operational.\n\nFierce fighting gets Sean within range of the computers; as crown prince and heir to the Imperial throne, he has all sorts of overrides and security codes. He shuts down the defenses, and Brashan defeats the Temple forces, ending the war.\n\nThe next time they are heard from is a few years later, when Dahak receives a message via their newly constructed hypercom. The Emperor and Empress are overjoyed to hear from the two whom they had long thought dead (thought it sincerely enough that they had had two more children). They had not rested in the meantime, defusing Jefferson's plan to kill all the people in the succession via a massive gravitonic bomb planted in a Narhani statue (intending to use his perversion of their gift as a way to blame them), and foiling his attempt on Jiltanith and Horus's life, at the cost of Horus.\n\nAfter this message, Colin and company, along with Dahak, immediately embark for Pardal, eager to see their children as the main effort to crush the xenophobic computers holding the Achuultani hostage begins to take form.\n\nExternal links \n An excerpt of Heirs of Empire is available for download or reading online at the Baen Free Library  here.

The family was commonly associated with poetry and the arts, so the river was frequently portrayed through various artistic expressions. The river is notable for its scenic beauty, which highlights the surrounding countryside's natural features, making it a popular tourist destination. The Ventadour River is also a popular spot for fishing, with grayling, brown trout, pike, and roach being among the top species caught.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"French corvette Diligente (1801)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Diligente was a 20-gun corvette of the French Navy, lead ship of her class. Built at Brest on private plans by Pierre Ozanne, she was particularly fast. The French Navy adopted the design and copied the plans as late as 1848. Originally armed with 6-pounder guns, she was later rearmed with heavier carronades. She continued in service, off and on, until she was struck in 1854.\n\nService history\n\nFrench Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars\nDiligente took part in the Atlantic campaign of 1806 in Leiss\u00e8gues' squadron, culminating in the Battle of San Domingo.\n\nThe frigates , , and Diligente captured and burned the American vessel Lark, Moore, master, which was sailing from Philadelphia to Jamaica.\n\nIn August 1808 Diligente, captained by Commander Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lemaresquier, with the corvettes  and Espi\u00e8gle, sailed from France with supplies for the island of Martinique. British ships chased the group through the Bay of Biscay and captured Sylphe and Espi\u00e8gle. Diligente escaped, only to encounter the British sloop , under Commander (later to be Admiral) Charles Napier, off Antigua. During a hard-fought action lasting three hours, Recruits mainmast fell, putting her somewhat at Diligentes mercy. However, a lucky shot ignited Diligentes ammunition store, causing some damage.  Diligente withdrew and later Lemaresquier justified his action on the grounds that other British naval vessels were approaching, which they were not, and the weight of Recruits broadside, which was heavier.\n\nOn 3 October, Diligente sank the Mexican brig Juliana. Then on 12 November she returned to Lorient. Here she served from 1811 to 1812 as a school ship. On 12 March she was in the harbour at Brest. On 2 December 1812, she accidentally collided with  in the Roads of Toulon.\n\nShe may have cruised in the Channel as  reported that on 20 December 1813 she had retaken and sent in the brig Racehorse, from Newfoundland for Teignmouth, that the French corvette Diligente had captured. In 1814 Diligente was paid off.\n\nBourbon Restoration\nAfter the Bourbon Restoration, Diligente underwent refitting at Brest between 22 August 1820 and 4 January 1821. She was recommissioned with 18-pounder carronades and was reclassified as a corvette aviso (sloop corvette). Then on 21 April she left Brest for the Antilles, Guiana and Newfoundland. By 30 August 1822 she was in the Antilles again.\n\nOn 2 November 1822 Diligente left Rochefort for Brazil, not returning to Brest until 27 December 1826. Around 1825 or so she was off the coast of Chile where she took a privateer that had fired a broadside at her.\n\nIn 1827 Diligente was again decommissioned for refitting. Then in 1828 she was in the Eastern Mediterranean.\n\nJuly Monarchy\nUnder Commandant Garibou Diligente took part in the expedition to the mouth of the Tagus River where a French squadron fought the Battle of the Tagus on 11 July 1831. The French vessels fought their way past the Portuguese forts guarding the mouth of the river and sailed up to Lisbon. There they forced the Portuguese king Dom Miguel to accede to French demands, among them that he recognize the July Monarchy. The French also seized all the military and commercial vessels they could find as reparations.\n\nThen in 1835\u201336 Diligente was on the Livorno station. On 30 January 1836, she was driven ashore and severely damaged at Livorno. On 26 October 1840 she left Toulon for Alexandria, Egypt. She visited Smyrna in March 1841.

The name Diligente translates to \"diligent\" in English, reflecting the ship's intended purpose of rapid pursuit and interception. The Diligente was launched in 1801 and promptly commissioned into the French Navy. The ship was 28 meters long, with a displacement of 250 tons. It was armed with sixteen 6-pounder guns and had a complement of around 100 officers and sailors. The Diligente saw action in several skirmishes against British ships during the Napoleonic Wars. In November 1805, it was part of a French flotilla that attempted to break through the British blockade of Brest. The Diligente fought fiercely against the British ship HMS Loire, but was ultimately captured and taken into British service. Under British command, the Diligente was re-armed and served as a sloop in the Royal Navy. It participated in several successful engagements against French ships, including the capture of the heavily armed privateer Le Superbe. In 1811, the Diligente was sold to the Portuguese Navy, where it continued to serve as a sloop for several years. It was eventually decommissioned and scrapped in 1832. The Diligente's service in both the French and British navies highlights the fluidity of naval allegiances during the Napoleonic Wars, as well as the importance of smaller, maneuverable vessels in naval warfare. Despite its relatively short service life, the Diligente played an important role in the conflicts of its time and left a lasting impression on naval history.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 23994545}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Port of Caen\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Port of Caen (French: Port de Caen) is the harbour and port authority of the Norman city of Caen, France.\n\nThe port of Caen is composed of a series of basins on the Canal de Caen \u00e0 la Mer, linking Caen to Ouistreham, 15\u00a0km (9.3\u00a0m) downstream, on the English Channel.\n\nLayout\nThe port of Caen was originally composed solely of the Bassin Saint-Pierre, in the centre of Caen. Increase in traffic  explains the digging up and creation of four more; the Nouveau Bassin (cruises), Bassin de Calix, Bassin de H\u00e9rouville (miscellaneous) and Bassin de Blainville (cereals). A new canal, as well as a new concert venue (the Carg\u00f6), were built next to the junction between the Canal and the Bassin Saint-Pierre, creating a sharp contrast with the disused warehouses.\n\nThe Bassin Saint-Pierre is used as a marina and is kept afloat with a height adjustable dam on the River Orne. The Nouveau Bassin, directly east of Saint-Pierre, although it receives cruise ships and ferries in need of berthing or repairs, is not in regular use.\n\nThe Viaduc de Calix, a large concrete viaduct, passes over the Orne valley and the canal. It has been built high enough to permit the transit of large tonnage ships. The Bassin de Calix, directly below the viaduct, is the only basin in regular use. Several cranes are used to load and unload cargo, mostly wood, onto lorries or trains.\n\nShips transporting cereals use Blainville wharf. Ships are stationed directly against the canal wall and load and unloaded by cranes and cereal silos.\n\nOuistreham\nAt the entrance of the canal is the Port of Caen's cross-channel ferry port.\n\nThe terminal building is situated in the western part of the terminal. Two sets of locks, beyond the seaport, keep the canal navigable towards Caen. The lock is composed to two lock basins and a lock keeper's tower.\n\nThe entrance to the port is a dredged channel, 8\u00a0m deep, below the hydrographic zero and 90\u00a0m long. The access channel itself is two nautical miles (4\u00a0km) long, on a 184\u00b05 axis, indicated by aligned luminous signalling. The channel, 150\u00a0m wide is bordered, to the west and the east by three sea mark buoys.\n\nThe outer harbour is a 250\u00a0m in diameter avoidance zone, permitting ferries to turn around.\n\nOuistreham possesses two ferry berths; Poste T1 and Poste T2.\n Poste T1 was built in 1986, it is capable of berthing ships up to 145\u00a0m long and 24\u00a0m wide. The minimum water depth is 5\u00a0m 50\u00a0cm at low tide.\n Poste T2 was built in 1992, it is capable of berthing ferries up to 165\u00a0m long and 26\u00a0m wide, on a dock wall 217\u00a0m long. Depth is kept at a minimum of 6\u00a0m above hydrographic zero.\n The tugboat is stationed between posts T1 and T2 in a 38\u00a0m long secluded.\n\nThe terminal itself is divided in two areas, T1 and T2, respectively 15 400\u00a0m\u00b2 and 56 100\u00a0m\u00b2 in area. The terminal's total area is 100 000\u00a0m\u00b2.\n\nBrittany Ferries\nUp to three sailings of Brittany Ferries depart Ouistreham per day. It is the Port of Caen's English Channel ferry port.\n\nIn the summer season, the MV Normandie and MV Mont St Michel operate the back-to-back, six-hour ferry crossing.

It is situated on the Canal de Caen a la Mer, which connects the city of Caen to the English Channel. The port handles a wide variety of cargo, including grain, building materials, and petroleum products, as well as serving as a base for fishing fleets. The port was established in the 14th century and has been a crucial transportation hub for the region ever since. In the early years, it was primarily used for the export of local goods such as grain and wool. In the 19th century, the construction of a rail link to the port led to an expansion in trade, with imports of coal, timber, and iron ore. During World War II, the port was a vital supply line for the Allied forces, with the port being heavily bombed during the Battle for Caen in 1944. After the war, the port was rebuilt and modernized to meet the demands of modern shipping. Today, the port is an important center for container shipping, with regular services to destinations all over the world. It also supports the local fishing industry, with a thriving fishing fleet based at the port. The port has undergone significant investment in recent years, with the construction of new container terminals and the expansion of its existing facilities to accommodate larger vessels. The Port of Caen is also a major tourist destination, with its historic waterfront and proximity to the D-Day Landing beaches attracting visitors from all over the world. The port is also a popular destination for cruise ships, with many visiting the nearby cities of Bayeux and Rouen. In conclusion, the Port of Caen plays a significant role in the economic and social life of the region, connecting it to the wider world and providing essential transport links for a variety of industries.

Standout defensive end Ross Browner, who had 78 tackles and 10 sacks on the season, anchored the Irish defensive front. Notre Dame started off the season with a disappointing 23-17 loss to Purdue but rebounded with impressive wins over Michigan and Michigan State. The Irish also played tough, competitive games against highly-ranked teams like Pittsburgh and Penn State, but ultimately fell short in both contests. One of the highlights of the season came in the final game, as Notre Dame pulled off a dramatic 23-17 upset over top-ranked and previously undefeated University of Southern California. The victory over the Trojans was particularly satisfying for the Irish, who had been defeated by USC in their previous eight meetings. Despite the impressive victory over USC, the 1982 season was ultimately a disappointment for Notre Dame and its fans.

This term is also used in contract law, where it implies an implied agreement between two parties to carry out a transaction according to the usual and customary practices in their particular industry. In the context of bankruptcy law, a transaction is considered to be in the ordinary course of business if it is consistent with the company's prior practices, is within the limits of its normal business operations, and does not involve any significant change in the nature of its business. If a transaction meets these criteria, it is typically allowed to proceed, even if it occurs during the company's financial distress or insolvency process. This concept is particularly relevant in bankruptcy cases, where a trustee may challenge transactions made by the company prior to its bankruptcy filing. In such cases, the trustee may use the \"ordinary course of business\" defense to argue that such transactions were made in the ordinary course of business and were, therefore, legitimate. In contract law, the ordinary course of business is a standard of performance that is implied in a commercial contract. This standard requires parties to perform their obligations in accordance with the usual and customary practices in their particular industry. Failure to do so would result in a breach of contract.

Appius's descendant Appius Claudius Pulcher (the consul of 79 BC) rehoused the imagines clipeatae (\"images on shields\") of his ancestors there, to advertise his descent from its founder.\n\nThe temple is depicted in the Forma Urbis Romae of the 3rd century.\n\nArcheology\n\nThe temple \u2013 long considered lost \u2013 was identified with the remains of a podium recovered in the 1930s building works to enable the nearby Theatre to be seen in isolation.  These remains belong to a reconstruction in the Augustan period which is not mentioned by the literary sources but is probably related to the transformation of the area during the construction of the Theatre at that time.  Augustus (with links to the temple's founders via his Claudian wife) may have funded the rebuilding, or the dedicator may have been yet another Appius Claudius Pulcher (consul of 38 BC, conqueror of the Hirpini and loyal ally and father-in-law to Augustus).\n\nThese podium remains are made up of the cement infill between the load-bearing structures.  (Those structures were constructed from opus quadratum blocks, looted for reuse after the temple was abandoned and now lost.)  The structure of the church of Santa Rita da Cascia in Campitelli by Carlo Maderno was moved onto this podium from the slopes of the Capitol at the time of the 1930s excavation and work on the Capitol.\n\nThe surviving remains and plan of the temple on the Forma Urbis Romae show that it had columns along all sides of the cella (with six - i.e. hexastyle - along the shorter sides, and nine along the long sides) and had a frontal staircase up onto the podium.  The temple's facade, like that of the neighbouring temple of Apollo, was part Carrara marble, part plastered travertine.\n\nThe Columna Bellica\n\nIn front of the temple was a column used in the archaic Roman ceremony for declaring war involved hurling a spear from Roman territory towards enemy territory.  However, when for the first time Rome had to declare war on a state whose territory did not border her own (i.e. Pyrrhus of Epirus), it was hard to see how this rite could be carried out.  A prisoner of war was therefore forced to hold a small piece of land in the area of the circus Flaminius, where a column was raised (perhaps in wood) as a symbolical representation of the hostile territory and a spear then hurled against the column.  This new procedure was then used on all subsequent occasions (the last well-known example is in 179 AD, under Marcus Aurelius).\n\nA circular area with the paving restored in front of this temple was interpreted in the excavations as the place where this column was sited, on the basis of literary references.  This is now interpreted as where the perirrhanterion (for lustrali at the end of campaigns) was sited before the temple of Apollo was built.\n\nSee also\n Temple of Bellona (Ostia)\n List of Ancient Roman temples\n\nExternal links\n\nS.Platner and T.Ashby, A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome, 1929\nPlans of the Apollo and Bellona temples on the Comune di Roma site here and here\nThe Roman ceremony of the declaration of war (Italian)\n\nBellona\n3rd-century BC religious buildings and structures\nRome R.

Owned by Toledo, Ohio\u2013based Block Communications, it is part of a duopoly with Salem, Indiana-licensed dual CW/MyNetworkTV affiliate WBKI (channel 58). Both stations share studios on West Muhammad Ali Boulevard (near US 150) in downtown Louisville, while WDRB's transmitter is located in rural northeastern Floyd County, Indiana (northeast of Floyds Knobs).\n\nHistory\n\nAs an independent station\nThe first construction permit for channel 41 in Louisville was issued in 1953 to Robert Rounsaville, owner of WLOU (1350 AM), Louisville's first Black-oriented radio station. The station, if built, would have been the first Black-oriented TV station in the country. However, the construction of WQXL-TV depended on the success of the first of three planned stations, Atlanta's WQXI-TV, which failed and left the air in 1955. The permit remained active for several more years; the call letters were changed to WTAM-TV, and in 1963 the permit was sold to Producers, Inc., of Evansville, Indiana, but no station ever materialized. Producers was related to the Polaris Corporation, which in Louisville owned WKYW (900 AM).\n\nOn July 7, 1965, Consolidated Broadcasting Company, a group of five people from Chillicothe, Missouri with no television station experience (but were eventually shareholders for what would become ill-fated Kansas City independent station KCIT-TV), filed for a construction permit for the channel. The permit was granted on April 20, 1966, but it would be nearly five years before any station came to air. Antenna height issues and permitting setbacks caused delays for the new WDRB-TV and for a channel 21 permittee. Approval was finally obtained that summer, and Consolidated renovated a building that had housed a lithograph studio on East Main Street in the Butchertown neighborhood to serve as WDRB-TV's studios.\n\nWDRB-TV finally signed on the air on February 28, 1971, becoming the first independent station in the Louisville market. Initially, the station signed on at 3:00\u00a0p.m. on weekdays; its programming included low-budget afternoon children's programming and occasional news updates provided by anchor Wilson Hatcher, and, most notably, the Saturday night horror film strand Fright Night, hosted by local theater actor Charlie Kissinger. Not long after going on air, WDRB-TV debuted an afternoon children's program, \"Presto the Magic Clown\", hosted by Bill \"Presto\" Dopp. The station was profitable within months and tied then-ABC affiliate WLKY-TV in the ratings.\n\nBy 1976, WDRB-TV carried a mix of cartoons, westerns, outdoor shows and classic movies. The station's original owners sold the station for $6.5 million to the Minneapolis Star & Tribune Company (which later became the Cowles Media Company) in 1977. By that year, the station expanded its broadcast day to 11:00\u00a0a.m., with the addition of a four-hour block of religious programs; by 1979, WDRB-TV began signing on daily at 7:00\u00a0a.m.\n\nIn 1980, the station moved from Butchertown to its present location on Muhammad Ali Boulevard. However, WDRB-TV would eventually pull out of a contest for something it had sought since December 1977; a move from channel 41 to channel 21. In 1981, an administrative law judge had denied the application and preferred the competing bid from the Word Broadcasting Network, only for the FCC review board to overturn the decision.\n\nCowles exited television in the early 1980s. After selling its only other station, KTVH in Hutchinson, Kansas, it sold WDRB to Block Communications of Toledo, Ohio for $10 million in 1983. Under Block, WDRB-TV dropped the channel 21 application, clearing the way for WBNA to launch. Block began to increase WDRB's profile in the market by acquiring higher-rated and more recent off-network sitcoms and dramas to its schedule, along with a focus on the broadcast rights for the burgeoning athletic programs of the University of Louisville's Cardinals, which the station won in 1985 and held for two years.\n\nAs a Fox affiliate\nOn October 9, 1986, WDRB-TV became an affiliate of the Fox network and became known as \"Fox 41\" in late 1989. WDRB-TV became one of two Fox affiliates serving the Louisville market in 1990, when Campbellsville-based WGRB (channel 34, later CW affiliate WBKI-TV) affiliated with the network. Channel 34 served the southern portions of the market before it moved its transmitter farther north to service more of the market; WDRB became the sole Fox station in Louisville when WGRB became a WB affiliate in 1997.\n\nDuring the 1990s, WDRB shifted away from running older movies and classic sitcoms in favor of acquiring more talk and reality shows. In 1990, the station also regained rights to Louisville athletics in 1990 after the university spent three years with WHAS-TV and upgraded its transmitter, improving signal coverage. In 1994, Block Communications entered into a local marketing agreement to operate Salem, Indiana-based WFTE (channel 58, later WMYO, now WBKI); Block acquired WFTE outright in 2001, creating the first television station duopoly in the Louisville market. WDRB continued to carry cartoons through Fox Kids throughout the 1990s; the Fox Kids weekday afternoon lineup was discontinued at the end of 2001, when the remaining Saturday block moved to channel 58 until its successor 4KidsTV was discontinued by Fox in November 2008.\n\nOn April 21, 2007, WDRB became the first television station in Louisville to televise the Kentucky Derby Festival's all-day \"Thunder Over Louisville\" air and fireworks show in high definition\u2014which, at the time, was one of the largest technical undertakings ever attempted by an American television station. This was followed by a second\u2014even more elaborate\u2014\"Thunder\" telecast in HD in April 2008.\n\nThe station began phasing out the \"Fox 41\" branding in favor of simply branding by the WDRB call letters in May 2011. While this occurred shortly after sister station KTRV-TV in Boise, Idaho unexpectedly lost its Fox affiliation, station management stated that the rebrand was done in order to bring its branding in line with Louisville's other major network stations\u2013NBC affiliate WAVE (channel 3), ABC affiliate WHAS-TV (channel 11) and CBS affiliate WLKY (channel 32)\u2013who have all long branded with their call letters. Additionally, station management wanted to distinguish the station from Fox News Channel; WDRB is one of a handful of Fox affiliates that omit network references in their branding.\n\nIn early 2011, the master control operations for WDRB and WMYO were upgraded to allow the transmission of syndicated and locally produced programs in high definition; it also upgraded its severe weather ticker seen on both stations to be overlaid on HD programming without having to downconvert the content to standard definition.\n\nOn June 1, 2012, WDRB, WMYO and their respective subchannels were pulled from Insight Communications, what was then the market's major cable provider, as Block was unable to come to terms on a new retransmission consent agreement with Time Warner Cable (which purchased Insight in February 2012, but had not yet rebranded those systems under the latter until in 2013). The affected stations were restored on June 6, 2012, as a result of a new carriage agreement between Block and TWC.\n\nIn May 2013, WDRB began construction of an additional  of space at its Muhammad Ali Boulevard studio facility, including an expanded newsroom and sales area; the addition of two conference rooms; offices for finance and editing departments; and the addition of a secondary studio to be used for commercial and station projects. The $1.7 million expanded facility opened on May 5, 2014; as a result of the expansion, sister station WBKI-TV relocated their employees from that station's offices in the Kaden Tower into the WDRB facility.\n\nProgramming\nIn addition to carrying the entire Fox programming schedule, syndicated programs broadcast by WDRB include Live with Kelly and Ryan, Rachael Ray, Judge Judy and Dr. Phil.\n\nSports programming\nCurrently, all sports programming is provided by the network. However, for many years, WDRB had rights to University of Louisville Cardinals football and men's basketball games, some of which were syndicated through the Lorimar Sports Network or Raycom Sports packages of Metro Conference basketball games from the 1980s until the Metro Conference merger with the Great Midwest Conference to create Conference USA in 1995.\n\nWDRB also previously broadcast some University of Kentucky Wildcats basketball games at some point during the 1990s.\n\nNews operation\nWDRB presently broadcasts 57\u00bd hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 9\u00bd hours each weekday and five hours each on Saturdays and Sundays); in regards to the number of hours devoted to news programming, it is the highest local newscast output among the broadcast television stations in the Louisville market and in the commonwealth of Kentucky.\n\nAfter more than a year of planning, WDRB launched its news department on March 12, 1990, with the debut of a half-hour 10:00\u00a0p.m. newscast originally titled The News at 10. Many longtime news personalities in the Louisville market joined the new WDRB news staff when the station formed its news operation; many others have joined channel 41 from other stations since that time. The News at 10 was originally anchored by Lauretta Harris (who joined WDRB from WAVE), Jim Mitchell (who started in the market at WHAS-TV, before moving to WAVE), meteorologist Tammy Garrison, and sports anchor David Sullivan.\n\nIn 1995, the program was retitled as Fox News at 10 and expanded to one hour and added weekend editions on Saturday and Sunday evenings. Bill Francis (formerly of WLKY) and Susan Sweeney (formerly with radio station WHAS (840 AM)) joined the staff as anchors of the weekend newscasts; Tara Bassett (who had previously worked at WAVE) was the weekend weather anchor. The station launched additional newscasts on its schedule as its ratings position in the market strengthened: the first news expansion outside its established 10:00 slot came on October 5, 1998, when WDRB premiered the three-hour-long Fox in the Morning and a half-hour midday newscast at 11:30\u00a0a.m. (originally titled Fox First News); the latter program expanded to an hour on September 21, 2015, with the addition of a half-hour noon newscast. This was later followed by the debut of an hour-long 4:00\u00a0p.m. newscast in September 2001.\n\nIn June 2002, WDRB became one of the few U.S. television stations to run a regular editorial segment, when it debuted \"Point of View\", a twice-weekly segment that is usually hosted by WDRB/WMYO president and general manager Bill Lamb; the segment introduced a weekly feature with viewer responses to the discussed topic via phone message in 2007. \"Point of View\" has evolved into one of the community's most prominent opinion forums, featuring frequent guest editorials by a wide array of community members. In 2006, WDRB\u2014in partnership with Norton Healthcare\u2014became the first and only station in Louisville to offer real-time closed captioning on all of its newscasts, making 100% of the station's news content available to over 147,000 deaf or hard of hearing viewers in the market. Prior to this, only pre-written studio-originated content was closed-captioned, while live field reports and breaking news stories were not transcribed.\n\nOn April 17, 2010, WDRB became the second television station in Louisville market (after WAVE) to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition; it was the first (and presently, the only) television station in the market to provide news video from the field in true high definition, as WDRB upgraded its ENG vehicles, satellite truck, studio and field cameras and other equipment in order to broadcast news footage from the field in high definition, in addition to segments broadcast from the main studio. By comparison at the time, WAVE only broadcast studio segments in HD, while field reports are presented in widescreen standard definition, while WHAS-TV and WLKY were still broadcasting in SD, stretched to fill 16:9 widescreen sets.\n\nOn January 17, 2011, WDRB launched a half-hour early evening newscast at 6:30\u00a0p.m. each weeknight (it is the only station in the United States that currently airs newscasts during the 4:00 and 6:30\u00a0p.m. timeslots); the program expanded to an hour-long broadcast on September 22, 2014, with the addition of a half-hour newscast at 6:00. WDRB began producing a half-hour weeknight 7:00\u00a0p.m. newscast on WBKI-TV on September 17, 2012; this was the result of a local marketing agreement that was forged between Block and WBKI-TV owner LM Communications, LLC (as such, WDRB is one of only a handful of Fox stations that produce a newscast for another station in the same market, among which include KCPQ in Seattle (which produces a 9:00\u00a0p.m. newscast for sister station KZJO) and KTVU in San Francisco (which produces a 7:00\u00a0p.m. newscast for sister station KICU-TV)); the WBKI newscast was canceled on September 19, 2015. On January 26, 2013, the station debuted a three-hour weekend morning newscast, airing Saturdays and Sundays from 6:00-9:00\u00a0a.m. On May 7, 2019, it was announced that WDRB had hired long-time WAVE anchor Scott Reynolds to anchor a new hour-long 5:00\u00a0p.m. newscast starting in September 2019.\n\nIn June 2013, WDRB gained notice in the television industry when it debuted a promo criticizing the broad, constant and generalized use of the term \"breaking news\" by other news stations (both within the Louisville market and around the United States), stating that \"breaking news\" has been overused as a \"marketing ploy\" by other stations, who tend to apply the term to stories that are low in urgency and/or relevance. To coincide with the promo, WDRB posted on its website a \"contract\" outline of its journalism practices with its viewers and advertisers, with the former list promising to judiciously use \"breaking news\" (applying the term to stories that are \"both 'breaking' and \"news'\"), as well as a general promise to deliver news in a truthful, balanced and informative manner, and without overt hype and sensationalism.\n\nJune 2019 saw Bill Lamb departing the station after his successes with WDRB, and becoming the general manager of Fox Television Stations' West Coast flagship duopoly of KTTV and KCOP-TV. Ricky Joseph from fellow Block station WAND will serve as an interim president/GM until Lamb's replacement is found.\n\nThe station gained national attention in November 2019 for a sweeps interview with the founder of Papa John's Pizza, John Schnatter (who had been a controversial local figure since his July 2018 ouster over use of a racial slur on a conference call). Schnatter had made the claim to WDRB's Stephan Johnson that he had found the quality control of the chain had declined after saying he ordered forty pizzas to eat from it in a month long period, and warned of a 'day of reckoning' for company board member Mark Shapiro for participating in Schnatter's ouster from the company.\n\nTechnical information\n\nSubchannels\nThis station's digital signal is multiplexed:\n\nIn late 2010, Block Communications began testing digital subchannels on both WDRB and WMYO; on or about January 30, 2011, WDRB began carrying the Tribune Broadcasting-owned Antenna TV network over its second digital subchannel. WDRB-DT2 was added to Insight Communications systems in the area on digital channel 187 on April 20, 2011. On March 1, 2017, WDRB added a third digital subchannel carrying Ion Television on WDRB-DT3, after previous affiliate WBNA became an independent station, and eventually upgraded it to Ion's default 720p high-definition presentation (with the added advantage of few to no preemptions of Ion programming, which WBNA did regularly).\n\nAnalog-to-digital conversion\nWDRB discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over UHF channel 41, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 49. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 41.\n\nOut-of-market coverage\nWDRB had previously been carried on many cable systems in areas adjacent to the Louisville market, including Kentucky's capital city, Frankfort. The channel was the first one sequentially on Frankfort's channel lineup (on channel 2), and was the sole source for Fox programming in HD in the capital city until 2012. On January 1, 2012, WDRB was removed from most cable systems outside of the market as a result of a corporate directive from Fox as part of its new affiliation agreement that forbade WDRB from being distributed on providers outside of its home market to protect ratings for the network's affiliates in nearby markets; this rule has been a source of conflict in several other markets, which have had out-of-market Fox affiliates from adjacent areas pulled from local cable providers. A few months later, the station removed the county outlines of Anderson and Franklin counties in Kentucky (the westernmost counties in the Lexington television market) and Switzerland County in Indiana (within the Cincinnati television market) from weather maps and severe weather alert displays; as a result, WDRB became the only Louisville area station that did not recognize Frankfort as being part of its viewing area. Despite this, Frankfort and Lawrenceburg are still occasionally mentioned during on-air weather segments. On December 20, 2017, the main cable provider in Frankfort, the Frankfort Plant Board, announced WDRB's return to their channel lineup, mainly for local news coverage, in 2018. Beginning sometime in April, WDRB returned on channels 4 and 504 in HD providing local news and syndicated programming while replacing Fox network programming with a cropped simulcast of Antenna TV from WDRB-DT2. At the same time, FPB began carrying the Antenna TV feed from WDRB-DT2 outright on channel 28, replacing the feed from WLJC-DT3 which had, in turn, replaced WTVQ-DT6 in early 2018 when Lexington's Antenna TV affiliation moved. WDRB was removed once again on January 1, 2021 after FPB and WDRB were unable to come to an agreement to continue carriage of the station, though this disagreement was based on financial differences rather than a network rule.\n\nIn the eastern half of the Bowling Green market, WDRB was carried on the Glasgow Electric Plant Board and South Central Rural Telephone Cooperative's cable system, despite the Glasgow area being in closer proximity to the viewing area of Nashville affiliate WZTV. However, blackouts of Fox programming by WBKO-DT2 were common, as was the blackouts of ABC programming from WHAS-TV were caused by WBKO's main channel. SCRTC and Glasgow EPB both dropped WDRB, WDRB-DT2 and WMYO in January 2015, with WDRB's main channel being dropped due to the presence of Fox affiliate WBKO-DT2; WMYO and WDRB-DT2 were respectively replaced by WCZU-LD, an upstart station serving as a primary MyNetworkTV and secondary Antenna TV affiliate. Both WBKO-DT2 and WCZU-LD claimed exclusivity in terms of Fox and MyNetworkTV affiliates on the Glasgow-based cable systems.\n\nWDRB remains available to Mediacom customers in Hart and Metcalfe counties. It is also available on Charter Spectrum channel 70 in the Owensboro and Henderson areas, as well as on Crystal Broadband Networks in Lewisport.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nWDRB official website\nFright Night program info\n\nFox network affiliates\nAntenna TV affiliates\nIon Television affiliates\nNewsy affiliates\nTelevision channels and stations established in 1971\nDRB\n1971 establishments in Kentucky", "machine_text": "WDRB is a Fox-affiliated television station in Louisville, Kentucky.

Minuscule 2502 is a codex of the Acts of the Apostles, dated to the 16th century. It is written on paper and contains a commentary by Theophylact of Bulgaria. Minuscule 2550, held in the Vatican Library, is a manuscript of the Gospel of Luke and the Gospel of John, written in the 15th century. It is decorated with headpieces and capitals. Another important manuscript in this list is minuscule 2575, also known as Codex Cretensis. This manuscript contains the entire New Testament, written on paper in the 16th century. It is notable for its elaborate decorations and for being the only complete manuscript of the New Testament in the Cretan dialect. Minuscule 2600, held in the monastery of Hosios Loukas in Greece, is a manuscript of the Gospels, written on parchment in the 12th century. It contains many marginal notes and is decorated with headpieces and initials. This list is part of an ongoing project to catalog and study all of the New Testament manuscripts in existence. While some of these manuscripts are well-known and have been studied extensively, others are more obscure and require further research.

It originally aired on December 9, 2010. The episode was written by Mike Daniels and directed by Elizabeth Allen.\n\nPlot\nTyler (Michael Trevino) gets ready for his first transformation since it is a full moon night. He is terrified by it and he calls Mason (Taylor Kinney) for help once more but cannot reach him. Tyler leaves a message on Mason's phone where Jules (Michaela McManus), a friend of Mason's, hears it and realizes that Mason is missing.\n\nElena (Nina Dobrev) and Bonnie (Kat Graham) are in Elena's bedroom and talking about the moonstone and how Bonnie has to despell it. Elena does not agree with the plan since it will make Klaus furious and he'll come to kill everyone but Elena; Jeremy (Steven R. McQueen) joins them and does not agree with Elena's suicidal plan. Bonnie and Jeremy leave Elena alone with the moonstone and Elena gets the opportunity to steal it and tries to sneak out of the house. She is stopped by Bonnie and Jeremy before she leaves and they tell her that they were testing her and she failed. They let her walk away but when she gets to the door, Elena realizes that she cannot get out of the house because Bonnie sealed her in with a spell.\n\nJules shows up at the Lockwood house just right before Tyler leaves. She introduces herself as Mason's friend and she tells Tyler and Carol (Susan Walters) that Mason is not back in Florida as they believe. Tyler leaves to meet Caroline (Candice Accola) at the Grill while Carol calls the Sheriff to report Mason's disappearance. Tyler tells Caroline about Mason and while they leave the Grill to go to the Lockwood cellar, Caroline manages to inform Alaric (Matt Davis) that Mason was reported missing.\n\nDamon (Ian Somerhalder) gets to Elena's to check up on her since Bonnie has to work on the moonstone and Caroline has to be with Tyler. He gets a call from Alaric who informs him that Jules is in town and that the authorities are now searching for Mason. Damon has to leave for the Grill, leaving Jeremy with Elena. He meets Alaric at the Grill and they wonder if Jules is also a werewolf and decide to find out. Alaric puts some wolfsbane in her drink while Damon is distracting her. Alaric leaves and Damon tries to chat with Jules about Mason and get information. When he insists that she should drink her drink, Jules calls him out for trying to fool her and tells him that she smelled him and the wolfsbane since the beginning. She threatens Damon and leaves. Damon tries to follow her but Alaric stops him and asks him to go home, lock the doors, and wait to deal with it until the morning when the full moon is gone.\n\nBonnie goes to Luka (Bryton James) to apologize for channeling him and to return his talisman. Luka forgives her and agrees to help her unbind the spell from the moonstone. They set up everything they need and start chanting while the moonstone elevates and explodes in the air. Bonnie looks happy that they managed to break the moonstone and the spell.\n\nTyler and Caroline are in the Lockwood cellar where Tyler installs new chains in the floor and walls to chain himself and Caroline mixes a wolfsbane cocktail for him. He chains himself up and tries to drink the cocktail while Caroline stays there to support him. As time passes, Tyler feels the pain and screams and asks Caroline to leave so he will not hurt her. Caroline tries to stay with him as much as she can but when the transformation begins, Tyler cannot control himself and she runs out of the cellar closing the door behind her so Tyler cannot get out. She runs into the woods and goes back to the cellar later to check up on Tyler. Tyler is back in his human form and Caroline gets back into the cellar to help him.\n\nBack at the Gilbert house, Jenna (Sara Canning) searches some files that Elena's mom was saving about the history of Mystic Falls, because she wants to help a \"writer\" who is working on a book. Elena seems fine with it and offers to help but she is terrified when she sees that the \"writer\" is Elijah (Daniel Gillies) and he is in the house. Elijah thanks Jenna for her help and pretends to leave. Elena runs to Jeremy's room to talk to him but Elijah stops her saying that he wants to talk to her.\n\nElijah and Elena get in her room and he lets her know that he doesn't want to break the curse and that he also does not intend to hurt her or anyone she loves. He says that Klaus has become paranoid over the years and he just wants to find where he is so he can kill him. Elijah wants to use Elena as bait to draw Klaus out and he makes a deal with Elena: she is to stop trying to kill herself and he will keep her family safe in return. Elena agrees but wants one more favor from him.\n\nLuka returns to his home where Jonas (Randy J. Goodwin) is waiting for him. Jonas asks if he was successful and Luka responds in the affirmative and gives him the moonstone that he and Bonnie supposedly destroyed. Luka does not seem really fine that he had to fool Bonnie and after he gives the moonstone to Jonas he turns to leave. Jonas stops him telling him that Elijah wants them to do one more thing for him.\n\nDamon is back at the Salvatore house where he finds Rose (Lauren Cohan) waiting for him. She apologizes for fleeing Slater's apartment when Elijah appeared and while they are talking they hear a noise of glass breaking. A werewolf breaks into the house and tries to attack Damon but Rose gets into the way and the werewolf bites her instead. Damon stabs the wolf with a sword and the injured wolf escapes. Damon checks up on Rose and they see that the bite starts healing. They are both relieved that the myth about the werewolf bite being fatal for vampires was not true.\n\nMeanwhile, Stefan (Paul Wesley) is still stuck in the tomb with Katherine who tries to seduce him by invading his mind. Stefan wakes up and tells her to stay out of his head. They start talking with Stefan asking her to apologize for all the things she did but Katherine does not apologize. She tells him that she loves him and to prove it she tells him that Isobel, Elena's birth mother, can help him find Klaus. Their conversation is interrupted by Elijah who comes to the tomb to free Stefan. Elijah explains that he made a deal with Elena which she will explain to him and he is now free to exit the tomb since Elijah had the spell lifted. Stefan gets out of the tomb and Katherine tries to follow him but Elijah blocks her way and compels her to stay in there unless he tells her otherwise. He wants to make sure that Klaus will know exactly where she is when he comes to town. Katherine begs Stefan to not leave her in there but Stefan walks away to go find Elena and the two of them make up and are back together.\n\nThe episode ends with Damon apologizing to Rose for picking a fight with a werewolf that led to her getting bitten. Rose is just relieved that the myth was not real and the two of them agree to stay friends with benefits. They start to kiss but Rose feels pain on her shoulder, where the werewolf bit her. They check on her shoulder and they see that the area is not exactly healed and they look at each other with fear and confusion in their eyes.\n\nFeature music\nIn \"By the Light of the Moon\" we can hear the songs:\n\"Quarry Hymns\" by Land of Talk\n\"Everything at Once\" by Superchunk\n\"I'm Alright\" by Agent Ribbons\n\"Let's Go Surfing\" by The Drums\n\"This Time Next Year\" by Goldhawks\n\"Shadowcasting\" by Ra Ra Riot\n\"Longest Night\" by Howie Day\n\nReception\n\nRatings\nIn its original American broadcast, \"By the Light of the Moon\" was watched by 3.16 million; down by 0.30 from the previous episode.\n\nReviews\n\"By the Light of the Moon\" received positive reviews.\n\nEmma Fraser from TV Over Mind gave an A rating to the episode saying that it was chock-full of story and emotion. \"This was the night that focused on the wolf mythology which allowed this story to shine, really terrific work from all those involved. The Elena thread has moved along nicely and whilst seeing her rebel from those protecting her is an interesting angle it will be welcome to see her being less impulsive in her attempts at protection. With a new problem with the unknown effect of a wolf bite the next episode should be a treat.\"\n\nDiana Steenbergen from IGN rated the episode with 8.5/10 saying that the episode was a typically overstuffed one, full of plot developments and intriguing character pairings. \"As a mid-season finale, the ending was something of a letdown, especially for a show that thrives on shocking its audience in the last few minutes of so many episodes. But with several weeks before the next new Vampire Diaries, maybe it is for the best that we are not left with a more riveting cliffhanger.\"\n\nMatt Richenthal of TV Fanatic rated the episode with 3.9/5 saying that it was not exactly the most action-packed episode and an overall letdown since this was the mid-season finale episode. However, Richenthal praised Michael Trevino and those who were involved in Tyler's transformation scene: \"Full props, however, must be given to Michael Trevino, and, really, everyone involved in that transformation scene. It was intense and agonizing to watch... in the best possible way.\"\n\nRobin Franson Pruter of Forced Viewing rated the episode with 3/4 saying that the werewolf transformation elevated a disjointed episode. \"The strength of the transition sequence in this episode elevates it above the average. However, the episode would have been stronger had it been more unified and cohesive and had it tried to cover less ground.\"\n\nShannon Vestal from Buzzsugar gave a good review to the episode saying that it was entertaining but she also feels like it was a bit of a letdown. \"As much as I love this show, it deserves a big come on this week. After a week of titillating previews of Stefan and Katherine mauling each other, it all turns out to be just a dream. What a letdown.\"\n\nMeg of Two Cents TV also gave a good review saying that this was a great episode. \"I thought this episode did a good job of moving the story forward past [...] We\u2019re moving forward on the road to Klaus and the werewolf storyline just keeps getting more interesting.\"\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n2010 American television episodes\nThe Vampire Diaries (season 2) episodes", "machine_text": "By the Light of the Moon is the 11th episode of the second season of the American supernatural drama television series, The Vampire Diaries.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Mar Thoma Syrian Church in Malaysia\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Mar Thoma Syrian Church in Malaysia is the Malaysian zone of the Diocese of Malaysia, Singapore & Australia in the Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church. It currently consists of a total of 16 parishes with 2,500 members nationwide.\n\nThe current bishop is the Rt. Rev. Joseph Mar Barnabas Episcopa.\n\nHistory\n\nEarly history\nThe Mar Thoma Church has a unique history in Malaysia being one of the few major denominations and churches not set up by missionaries or ordained priests. Instead it was initiated by a group of Malayali immigrants that were then employed in British Malaya.\n\nMigrants from the Syrian Christian community of Kerala, are reported to have first arrived on the shores of the then Malaya as early as 1910. The Syrian Christian community was always a small community with only 70 Syrian Christians recorded in the census of 1930. Among the earliest was Isaac Benjamin (also known as the \"Ninan Inspector\") who was followed by K.C. George in 1911. K.C. George laid the foundation of the Mar Thoma Church in Malaya by actively encouraging the movement of Syrian Christians from Kerala to Malaya, in spite of the dangers posed by malaria, rampant this country at that time.\n\nEarly Mar Thoma services generally took the form of prayer meetings in private homes. The first service following the Mar Thoma Service Order was held on the first Sundays of every month in the Jubilee School in Klang. This was followed in 1929 by regular services in the Penuel High School in Kuala Lumpur led by K. G. Mathew.\n\nThe first clergy arrives\nIn 1928, the Very Rev. V.P. Mammen (later Vicar General V. P. Mammen Kasseessa), the General Secretary of the Sunday School Samajam, visited Malaya and upon his return to India strongly recommended to the Sabha Council that a Syrian Christian priest be sent there,to meet the desire of Marthomites to hold formal worship services in Malayalam. In 1932, Mar Thoma members in Klang, Kuala Lumpur, Banting and Kuala Selangor passed a resolution to request a priest from India, who would be resident in Malaya for a few years.\n\nThe call was answered when the Rev. T.N. Koshy arrived from India in August 1936. Rev. T.N. Koshy travelled the length and breadth of Malaya and Singapore to minister to the spiritual needs of the Syrian Christian community who were already here and those who were still coming to Malaya. This led to the setting up of one single parish covering the whole of Malaya and Singapore and laid the foundations of another era in the history of the Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church marking the establishment of the first Mar Thoma parish outside of India.\n\nWar and peace\nWhile there were those who doubted the viability of creating a parish out of this scattered community, they had not reckoned on the steady growth of the population. While most Syrian Christians still thought of Malaya as a temporary sojourn, there were signs of increasing commitment to this country; one of the most important was the purchase of a piece of land in Kuala Lumpur, on which to construct a church. What was significant was that this purchase was made right at the height of the Japanese Occupation.\n\nWith the conclusion of the war, a spurt in migrations of Syrian Christians was seen as further opportunities in the plantation, civil/administrative services and educational sectors opened up. The Rev. V.E. Thomas (later Senior Vicar for Malaysia-Singapore); who was here during the war years; received ordination in 1947 in India and returned to assist to meet the need of the increasing membership. In September/October 1953, the first three church buildings of the Mar Thoma community in Malaya; all named after St. Thomas; (in Kuala Lumpur, Klang and Singapore) were consecrated by the Rt. Rev. Dr. Mathews Mar Athanasius during the first ever Episcopal visit to the fledgling Mar Thoma Church in Malaya and Singapore.\n\nIn 1958, the Rev. T.N. Koshy was elevated as the Vicar-General for Malaya in recognition of the valuable services he rendered in encouraging and fostering the growth of the church in Malaya.\n\nElevation as diocese\nWith the independence of Malaya in 1957, the number of parishes grew steadily and in 1962, the Diocese of Malaysia and Singapore was constituted comprising 27 parishes. Although the community suffered from emigration, especially after the May 13 Incident of 1969, activity continued apace indicating the further indigenisation of the Mar Thoma Church in Malaysia.\n\nIn 1982, the parishes in Malaysia and Singapore were constituted as the \"Malaysian Zone and the Singapore Zone of the Diocese of Malaysia and Singapore respectively (now the Diocese of Malaysia, Singapore and Australia).\n\nOrganisation and Symbols\n\nThe Zonal Assembly\nThe church convenes a Zonal Assembly annually as the highest decision making body of the church and it consists of elected representatives of the various parishes and organisations. Zonal assembly members are elected for a 3-year period. The Zonal council consisting of all the vicars, the zonal secretary, the zonal treasurer and three council members function as the decision making and operational arm of the church.\n\nLogo of the Mar Thoma Church\nThe logo of the Mar Thoma Church consists of a shield emblazoned with a Christian cross with the representation of the Ashoka Chakra at its centre. It is flanked on the right and left by a lotus and a hand lamp respectively. The motto; Lighted To Lighten; is written in English above the cross.\n The Motto\nThe role of the church is to spread the good news of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Every believer and member of the Church here in their position, wherever they are, are given the light so that they can lighten others.\n The Cross\nThe cross placed in the centre represents the centrality of Jesus Christ in the church and its mission. It is a proclamation that God (Purusha) himself came and atoned for all mankind and the redemption is freely available by faith in Jesus Christ without regard to any form of karma.\n The Ashoka Chakra\nThe Ashoka Chakra is the symbol of India and represents the Indian roots of the church. Traditionally the Chakra as presented by the Emperor Ashoka, was a symbol in denoting the Wheel of Life and Cosmic Order (or Dharmachakra). By placing the wheel at the heart of the Cross, it is a declaration that life finds its ultimate salvation in the atoning sacrifice of Jesus once and for all. It symbolises the completion and closing of the wheel of life for all those who follow the Bhakthi Marga (path of righteousness) in Jesu Maseeh'' (Jesus Christ).\n The Hand Lamp\nThe hand lamp represents the lamp that is carried in all believers. It reminds all believers to be the light of the world and act as a witness to give the light of salvation for others in their daily life. It also seeks to remind to pay diligent attention to the study of the word of God.\n The Lotus\nThe lotus represents holy living and is traditionally part of the offering of sacrifices of praise and adoration in the Indian tradition to God. It reminds believers to live holy despite the circumstances around them and exude the fragrance of God.\n\nSee also\n Christianity in Malaysia\n Mar Thoma Church\n\nExternal links\n Mar Thoma Syrian Church in Malaysia\n St. Thomas' Church, Klang\n\nReferences\n\nChurches in Malaysia\nSaint Thomas Christians\nChristian organizations established in 1962\nChristian denominations established in the 20th century", "machine_text": "The Mar Thoma Syrian Church in Malaysia is a Christian denomination that traces its roots to the Malankara Syrian Orthodox Church, one of the oldest Christian communities in India.

The Mar Thoma Syrian Church is one of the ancient Christian faiths in India and follows the Apostolic Succession of St. Thomas who traveled to India in AD 52. Today, the church in Malaysia is an autonomous body of the Mar Thoma Syrian Church. Today, the Mar Thoma Syrian Church has congregations in Malaysia's major cities, including Kuala Lumpur, Penang, Klang, Johor Bahru, and Seremban.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Origin theories of Christopher Columbus\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The exact ethnic or national origin of Christopher Columbus (1451\u20131506) has been a source of speculation since the 19th century. The general consensus among historians is that Columbus's family was from the coastal region of Liguria, that he spent his boyhood and early youth in the Republic of Genoa, in Genoa, in Vico Diritto, and that he subsequently lived in Savona, where his father Domenico moved in 1470. Much evidence derives from data concerning Columbus's immediate family connections in Genoa and opinions voiced by contemporaries concerning his Genoese origins, which few dispute.\n\nMany other hypotheses exist, none of which are broadly accepted. \n\nAn international DNA study aimed at determining Columbus's origins began in 2021.\n\nGenoese origin\n\nDocuments \nIn a 1498 deed of primogeniture, Columbus writes:\n\nMany historians, including a distinguished Spanish scholar, Altolaguirre, affirm the document's authenticity; others believe it apocryphal. Some believe that the fact that it was produced in court, during a lawsuit among the heirs of Columbus, in 1578, does not strengthen the case for its being genuine.\n\nA letter from Columbus, dated 2 April 1502, to the Bank of Saint George, the oldest and most reputable of Genoa's financial institutions, begins with the words:\n\nAlthough some people consider this letter suspect, the vast majority of scholars believe it genuine. The most scrupulous examination by graphologists testifies in favour of authenticity. The letter is one of a group of documents entrusted by Columbus to a Genoese friend, after the bitter experiences of his third voyage, before setting out on his fourth.\n\nIn the spring of 1502, Columbus collected notarized copies of all the writings concerned with his rights to the discovery of new lands. He sent these documents to Nicol\u00f2 Oderico, ambassador of the Republic of Genoa. To Oderico he also gave \"the letter to the Bank of Saint George\", in which he announced that he was leaving the bank one-tenth of his income, with a recommendation for his son Diego. Oderico returned to Genoa and delivered the letter to the bank. The bank replied on 8 December 1502, lauding the gesture of their \"renowned fellow-citizen\" towards his \"native land\". The reply, unfortunately, never reached its destination; Columbus, back in Castile after his fourth voyage, complained about this in another letter to Ambassador Oderico, dated 27 December 1504, and promptly annulled the bequest.\n\nThe first letter was preserved in the archives of the Bank of Saint George until it was taken over by the municipality of Genoa; the other three remained in the Oderico family archives until 1670, when they were donated to the Republic of Genoa. After the fall of the Republic, they passed to the library of one of its last senators, Michele Cambiaso, and were finally acquired by the city of Genoa.  There are also public and notarial acts (more than a hundred) \u2014 copies of which are conserved in the archives of Genoa and Savona \u2014 regarding Columbus's father, Columbus himself, his grandfather, and his relatives.\n\nAnother doubt remains to be settled: that is, whether or not all of the documents cited concern the Christopher Columbus who was later to become Crist\u00f3bal Col\u00f3n, admiral of the Ocean Sea in Spanish territory. The list of contemporary ambassadors and historians unanimous in the belief that Columbus was Genoese could suffice as proof, but there is something more: a document dated 22 September 1470 in which the criminal judge convicts Domenico Colombo. The conviction is tied to the debt of Domenico \u2014 together with his son Christopher (explicitly stated in the document) \u2014 toward a certain Girolamo del Porto. In the will dictated by Admiral Christopher Columbus in Valladolid before he died, the authentic and indisputable document which we have today, the dying navigator remembers this old debt, which had evidently not been paid. There is, in addition, the act drawn in Genoa on 25 August 1479 by a notary, Girolamo Ventimiglia. This act is known as the Assereto document, after the scholar who found it in the State Archives in Genoa in 1904. It involves a lawsuit over a sugar transaction on the Atlantic island Madeira. In it, young Christopher swore that he was a 27-year-old Genoese citizen resident in Portugal and had been hired to represent the Genoese merchants in that transaction. Here was proof that he had relocated to Portugal. It is important to bear in mind that at the time when Assereto traced the document, it would have been impossible to make an acceptable facsimile. Nowadays, with modern chemical processes, a document can be \"manufactured\", made to look centuries old if need be, with such skill that it may be difficult to prove it is a fake. In 1960, this was still impossible.\n\nIn addition to the two documents cited, there are others that confirm the identification of the Genoese Christopher Columbus, son of Domenico, with the admiral of Spain. An act dated 11 October 1496 says:\n\t\n\nIn a fourth notarial act, drawn in Savona on 8 April 1500, Sebastiano Cuneo, heir by half to his father Corrado, requested that Christopher and Giacomo (called Diego), the sons and heirs of Domenico Colombo, be summoned to court and sentenced to pay the price for two lands located in Legine. This document confirms Christoforo and Diego's absence from the Republic of Genoa with these exact words: \"dicti conventi sunt absentes ultra Pisas et Niciam.\"\n\t \nA fifth notarial act, drawn in Savona on 26 January 1501, is more explicit. A group of Genoese citizens, under oath, said and say, together and separately and in every more valid manner and guise, that Christopher, Bartholomew and Giacomo Columbus, sons and heirs of the aforementioned Domenico, their father, have for a long time been absent from the city and the jurisdiction of Savona, as well as Pisa and Nice in Provence, and that they reside in the area of Spain, as was and is well known.\n\t \nFinally, there is a very important sixth document from the notary of Bartolomeo Oddino, drawn in Savona on 30 March 1515. With this notarial act, Leon Pancaldo, the well-known Savonese who would become one of the pilots for Magellan's voyage, sends his own father-in-law in his place as procurator for Diego Columbus, son of Admiral Christopher Columbus. The document demonstrates how the ties, in part economic, of the discoverer's family with Savona survived even his death.\n\nThe life of Admiral Christopher Columbus by his son Ferdinand \nA biography written by Columbus's son Ferdinand (in Spanish and translated to Italian), Historie del S. D. Fernando Colombo; nelle quali s'ha particolare, et vera relatione della vita, et de' fatti dell'Ammiraglio D. Christoforo Colombo, suo padre; Et dello scoprimento, ch'egli fece delle Indie Occidentali, dette Nuovo Mondo (\"Accounts of His Lordship Ferdinand Columbus; among which there are particulars and a true relation of the life, and of the deeds of the Admiral, Sir Christopher Columbus, his father; and of the discovery, which he made, of the West Indies, called the New World,\" abbreviated as \"The life of the Admiral Christopher Columbus by his son Ferdinand\"), exists.<ref>Col\u00f3n, Fernando (translated by Benjamin Keen). \"The life of the Admiral Christopher Columbus, Greenwood Press, 1978. Retrieved 2006-10-10.</ref>  \nIn it, Ferdinand claimed that his father was of Italian aristocracy. He describes Columbus to be a descendant of a Count Columbo of the Castle Cuccaro (Montferrat). Columbo was in turn said to be descended from a legendary Roman General Colonius. It is now widely believed that Christopher Columbus used this persona to ingratiate himself with the aristocracy, an elaborate illusion to mask a humble merchant background. Ferdinand dismissed the fanciful story that the Admiral descended from the Colonus mentioned by Tacitus. However, he refers to \"those two illustrious Coloni, his relatives.\" According to Note 1, on page 287, these two \"were corsairs not related to each other or to Christopher Columbus, one being Guillame de Casenove, nicknamed Colombo, Admiral of France in the reign of Louis XI\". At the top of page 4, Ferdinand listed Nervi, Cogoleto, Bogliasco, Savona, Genoa and Piacenza (all inside the former Republic of Genoa) as possible places of origin. He also stated:\n\nIn chapter ii, Ferdinand accuses Agostino Giustiniani of telling lies about the discoverer:\n\nIn chapter v, he writes:\n\nFerdinand also says (chapter xi) that before he was declared admiral, his father used to sign himself \"Columbus de Terra rubra,\" that is to say, Columbus of Terrarossa, a village or hamlet near Genoa. In another passage, Ferdinand says that his father went to Lisbon and taught his brother Bartholomew to construct sea charts, globes and nautical instruments; and sent this brother to England to make proposals to Henry VII of his desired voyage. Finally, Ferdinand says incidentally (chapter lxxii) that Christopher's brother, Bartholomew Columbus named the new settlement Santo Domingo in memory of their father, Domenico.\n\nThe publication of Historie has been used by historians as providing indirect evidence about the Genoese origin of Columbus.\n\n The testimony of the ambassadors \nIt is significant that no one protested at the court of Spain when in April 1501, in the feverish atmosphere of the great discovery, Nicol\u00f2 Oderico, ambassador of the Genoese Republic, after praising the Catholic Sovereigns, went on to say that they \"discovered with great expenditure hidden and inaccessible places under the command of Columbus, our fellow-citizen, and having tamed wild barbarians and unknown peoples, they educated them in religion, manners and laws\". Furthermore, two diplomats from Venice \u2014 no great friend of Genoa, indeed, a jealous rival \u2014 added the appellation \"Genoese\" to Columbus's name: the first, Angelo Trevisan, in 1501, the second, Gasparo Contarini, in 1525. In 1498, Pedro de Ayala, Spanish ambassador to the English court, mentioned John Cabot, \"the discoverer, another Genoese, like Columbus\". All these references were published, along with reproductions of some of the original documents, in the City of Genoa volume of 1931.\n\n Support for the Genoese origin from contemporary European writers \nThe historian Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas, whose father traveled with Columbus on his second journey and who personally knew Columbus's sons, writes in chapter 2 of his Historia de las Indias:\n\nThe historian Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo y Vald\u00e9s, writes that Domenico Colombo was the Admiral's father; and in chapter 2, book 3 of his Historia general y natural de las Indias:\n\nMany contemporary writers agree that the discoverer was Genoese:\n\nThe Portuguese Rui de Pina wrote two works, Chronica d'El Rey, dom Affonso and Chronica d'El Rey, dom Jo\u00e3o II. It has been ascertained that the manuscripts had been completed before 1504, although they were published in the Eighteenth century. Chapter 66 in the second manuscript, \"Descubrimiento das Ilhas de Castella per Collombo,\" explicitly states, \"Christovan Colombo italiano.\"\nIn the 1513 edition of the Map of the New World from Ptolemy, it says: \"This land with the adjacent islands was discovered by the Genoese Columbus, sent by the King of Castile.\"\nThe Turkish geographer Piri Ibn Haji Mehmed, known as Piri Reis, in his map of 1513, writes: \"These coasts are called the coasts of the Antilles. They were discovered in the year 896 of the Arabic calendar. It is said that a Genoese infidel, Columbus by name, discovered the place.\"\nHernando Alonso de Herrera, in his anti-Aristotelian dissertation, completed in Salamanca in 1516, and published in Latin and Spanish, wrote: \"Xristoval Colon ginoves.\"\nIn a Portuguese map of 1520, it is said: \"Land of the Antipodes of the King of Castile, discovered by Christopher Columbus Genoese.\"\nThe German Peter von Bennewitz writes, in 1520, in the Typus Orbis Universalis: \"In the year 1497 (sic) this land (America) with the adjacent islands was discovered by Columbus, a Genoese by mandate of the King of Castile.\"\nThe German Johannes Sch\u00f6ner states in the Globus of 1520: \"This (island) produces gold, mastic, aloes, porcelain, etc. and ginger \u2014 Latitude of the island 440 miles \u2014 Longitude 880 \u2014 discovered by Christopher Columbus Genoese, captain of the King of Castile in the year of Our Lord 1492.\"\nThe Spaniard Francisco L\u00f3pez de G\u00f3mara writes: \"Christopher Columbus was originally from Cogurreo or Nervi, a village of Genoa, a very famous Italian city.\"\nThe Portuguese Garcia de Resende, poet and editor, writes: \"Christouao Colombo, italiano.\"\nThe Swiss Heinrich Glarean (Loriti) writes: \"To the west there is a land they call America. Two islands, Hispaniola and Isabella: which regions were travelled, along the coast, by the Spaniards, by the Genoese Columbus and by Amerigo Vespuzio.\"\nThe Spaniard Hieronymo Girava, who lived in the first half of the 16th century, writes: \"Christoval Colon Genoese, great seaman and mediocre cosmographer.\"\nThe Portuguese Jo\u00e3o de Barros writes: \"As all men declare, Christov\u00e3o Colom was of Genoese nation, a man expert, eloquent and good Latinist, and very boastful in his affairs\"; and: \"As in this kingdom came Christopher Columbus Genoese, who had just discovered the western islands that now we call Antilles.\"\nThe German known as Giovanni Boemo Aubano, of the first half of the 16th century, writes: \"Christoforo Palombo, Genoese, the year 1492.\"\nThe Flemish Abraham Ortelius, writes: \"It seems to surpass the bounds of human wonder that all this hemisphere (that today is called America and, because of its immense extent, the New World) remained unknown to the ancients until the Christian year 1492, in which it was first discovered by Christopher Columbus, Genoese.\"\nThe Portuguese Dami\u00e3o de G\u00f3is, writes: \"The Genoese Columbus, a man expert in nautical arts\" ; and, in the index: \"Columbi genuen- sis, alias Coloni commendatio.\" \nThe Spaniard Nicol\u00e1s Monardes, writes: \"In the year 1492 our Spaniards were led by don Christoval Colon, native of Genoa, to discover the West Indies.\"\nThe German Laurentius Surius, writes: \"There was at the court of the King of Spain a certain Christopher Columbus whose homeland was Genoa.\"\nIn 1579, for the Cristoph Pantin's edition, the yearbooks of the Genoese Senate were published, in Antwerp, edited by Petro Bizaro: Senatus Populique Genuensis rerum domi forisque gestarum historiae atque annales. Among what is written to celebrate many industrious Genoese men, you can read that: \"cum Christophoro Columbo navalis scientiae absolutissima peritia apud omnem venturam posteritatem, juro optima aliqua ex parte conferri vel comparari possit.\"\nThe Portuguese Fern\u00e3o Vaz Dourado in the Atlante of 1580, notes: \"Land of the Antipodes of the King of Castile discovered by Christopher Columbus Genoese.\"\nThe Spaniard Alvaro Gomez, writes: \"Thanks to the eager industry of Christopher Columbus Genoese, word was brought to our Sovereigns of an unknown world.\"\nThe Frenchman Gilbert G\u00e9nebrard, writes: \"Ferdinand, at the urging of his wife Isabella, Queen of Castile, Le\u00f2n and Aragon, sent Christopher Columbus Genoese to seek new land.\"\nThe Swiss Theodor Zwinger, who died in 1588, was the author of the Theatrum Humanae Vitae, Basle 1604. In the index we read: \"Cristoforo Colono, or Colombo Genoese.\"\nOn an unspecified date, certainly prior to 1591, the Turk Basmagi Ibrahim published a book, written by a Turkish author who has remained anonymous, entitled Turich-i-Hind-i garbi iachod hadis-i-nev (History of the West Indies, in other words the New Story). The third chapter of this book dedicated to the discoverer of the \"New World or New Land,\" states: \"From the village of Nervi, which is among the Genoese possessions, a man who was born who had the name Christopher and the surname Columbus. Since he had completed journeys by land and by sea [...] he stayed on an island by the name of Madeira [...] under the domain of the wretched (sic) Portugal.\"\nThe Flemish Theodor De Bry, writes: \"From everything it can be stated with certainty that it was first discovered by Christopher Columbus Genoese.\"\nThe Portuguese Gaspar Frutuoso, in a sixteenth-century manuscript entitled As Saudades da terra, printed by Alvaro Rodriguez Azevedo in 1873 in Funchal (Madeira), writes in the Anales of Porto Santo: \"On this island the great Christovao Colombo, the Genoese, resided for some time.\"\nThe German David Chytraeus writes: \"Primum Novum Orbem in occidente, omnibus antea ignotum et inaccessam... pervestigare et aperire... Christophorus Columbus Genesis, admirand ad omnen posteritatem ausu et industria coeperat.\"\nIn the volume published by the City of Genoa the testimony is cited of the historian Andres Bernaldez, who died in 1513. He was the author of a Historia de los Reyes Catolicos don Fernando y dona Isabel. In this work, belatedly published in Seville in 1869, it is written: \"In the name of Almighty God, a man of the land of Genoa, a merchant of printed books who was called Christopher Columbus.\" Actually, in the original text of Bernaldez, it says \"land of Milan\". However, this is merely lack of precision. In the 15th century, the Republic of Genoa was alternately fully and legally dependent on the Duchy of Milan and the latter's satellite. The editor rightly interpreted the Milanese reference in the sense of Genoese origin.\n\nColumbus's Genoese birth is also confirmed by the works of the English Hakluyt (1601), of the Spaniard Antonio de Herrera (1612), the great Spanish dramatist Lope de Vega (1614), a paper manuscript dated 1626, conserved in Madrid's National Library, the works of the German Filioop Cluwer (1677), the German Giovanni Enrico Alsted (1649), the French Dionisio Petau (1724), and the Spaniard Luigi de Marmol (1667). This list represents the early writings of non-Italians. There were sixty-two Italian testimonies between 1502 and 1600. Of these fourteen are from Ligurian writers. It may be obvious, but not useless, to underline that the Venetians' (e.g. Trevisan's and Ramusio's) recognition of Columbus's Genoese birth constitutes a testimony as impartial as that of the Spaniards, French, and Portuguese.\n\nConformable to the testament in Seville (3 July 1539) is the evidence of Ferdinand Columbus, who states that his father was conterraneo (of the same country) with Mons. Agostino Giustiniani, who was, beyond all doubt, Martini, Dario G. \"Cristoforo Colombo tra ragione e fantasia.\" ECIG, 1987. pp. 12 and 513.

In his letter of May 14, 1493, addressed to Giovanni Borromeo, he referred to Columbus as Ligurian, Liguria being the Region where Genoa is located.\nMichele da Cuneo from Savona, a friend of Columbus's (possibly from childhood), sailed with Columbus during the second voyage and wrote: \"In my opinion, since Genoa was Genoa, there was never born a man so well equipped and expert in the art of navigation as the said lord Admiral.\"\nGiambattista Strozzi, a Florentine merchant, reported in a letter sent from Cadiz on March 19, 1494: \"On the 7th of this month there arrived here in safety twelve caravels which came from the new islands found by Columbus Savonese, Admiral of the Ocean, for the king of Castile, having come in twenty-five days from the said islands of the Antilles.\"\nCes\u00e1reo Fern\u00e1ndez Duro in his book Col\u00f3n y la Historia postuma, mentions the chronicler Alonso Estanquez, who has composed a Cr\u00f3nica de los reyes don Fernando y do\u00f1a Isabel, before 1506, where he writes: \"Cristobal Col\u00f3n, genov\u00e9s.\"\nIn 1507 Martin Waldseem\u00fcller published a world map, Universalis Cosmographia, which was the first to show North and South America as separate from Asia and surrounded by water.

Another witness at the same hearing placed it more precisely, testifying, \"I heard it said that [he] was from the seigneury of Genoa, from the city of Savona.\" \nFather Antonio de Aspa, a Hieronymite from the convent of Mejorada, between 1512 and 1524, wrote a report on Columbus's first voyage, drawn largely from the Decades of Peter Martyr d'Anghiera, in which he claimed that Columbus was Genoese. \nThe Portuguese Jorge Reinel, in his map of 1519, writes the following words: \"Xpoforum c\u00f5lombum genuensem.\" \nThe German Simon Grynaeus, writes: \"Christophorus natione Italicus, patria Genuensis, gente Columba.\"\nD. Diego, a grandson of the admiral, was knight of the Order of Santiago, in the genealogy section, of 1535, says: \"Paternal Grandparents / Christopher Columbus, a native of Saona near Genoa, / and Filipa Moniz, a native of Libon.\" In the same year, Pedro de Arana, a cousin of Columbus's Spanish mistress, testified that he knew Columbus was from Genoa. \nThe Spaniard Alonzo de Santa Cruz, c. 1550, said Columbus was from Nervi.\nThe Spaniard Pedro Cieza de Le\u00f3n writes that Columbus was originally from Savona.\nIn his Commentarius de Ophyra regione apud Divinam Scripturam Commemorata of 1561, the Portuguese geographer Gaspar Barreiros, reported that Columbus was \"Ligurian.\" \nThe Spaniard Jer\u00f3nimo Zurita y Castro, writes: \"Christopher Columbus, man, as he said, whose company had always been for the sea and its predecessors, so that was foreign born and raised in poverty and the banks of Genoa.\"\nThe Portuguese Ant\u00f3nio Galv\u00e3o, writes: \"In the yeere 1492, in the time of Don Ferdinando king of Castile, he being at the siege of Granada, dispatched one Christopher Columbus a Genoway with three ships to goe and discouer Noua Spagna.\"\nThe Spaniard Gonzalo de Illescas, writes: \"Christopher Columbus Genoese, was born at Nervi, a village near to Genoa.\"\nThe Spaniard Esteban de Garibay, humanist and historian, writes: \"A man of the Italian nation, named Christopher Columbus, native of Cugurco (Cogoleto), or Nervi, village of Genoa.\"\nThe Portuguese Jo\u00e3o Matalio Metelo Sequano in 1580, writes that Columbus was born in the city of Genoa. \nThe Frenchman Lancelot Voisin de La Popelini\u00e8re, writes: \"La plupart des princes chretiens, le nostre sur tous, l'Anglais, le Portugais, l'Espagnol m\u00e9mes, n'avaient daign\u00e9 pr\u00e9ster sculement l'ou\u00ede a l'ouverture que l'ltalien leur faisait.\"\nThe Spaniard Juli\u00e1n del Castillo, writes: \"Christopher Columbus, an Italian, was originally from Cogurio (Cogoleto) or Nervi, village near to the famous city of Genoa.\"\nThe German Michael Neander, writes: \"Christophoro Colombo Genuensi.\"\nThe Spaniard Gonzalo Argote de Molina clearly identified Albissola Marina as Columbus's birthplace.\nFriar Juan de la Victoria, author of the 16th century, wrote a Cat\u00e1logo de los Reyes godos de Espa\u00f1a extracted from Fern\u00e1ndez Duro in his Col\u00f3n y La Historia Postuma; says the friar: \"In the year 1488, the Italian Christopher Columbus, native of Cugureo (Cogoleto) or Nervi, village of Genoa, sailor.\"\nThe Spaniard Juan de Castellanos, poet and chronicler, writes that Columbus was born in Nervi.\nThe Spaniard Juan de Mariana, writes: \"Christopher Columbus, Genoese of nation.\"\nThe Portuguese Pedro de Mariz, historian and librarian, says that Columbus was Genoese.\n\n Historians \n\nScholars agree that Columbus was Genoese.\n\nSamuel Eliot Morison, in his book Christopher Columbus: Admiral of the Ocean Sea, notes that many existing legal documents demonstrate the Genoese origin of Columbus, his father Domenico, and his brothers Bartolomeo and Giacomo (Diego). These documents, written in Latin by notaries, were legally valid in Genoese courts. The documents, uncovered in the 19th century when Italian historians examined the Genoese archives, form part of the Raccolta Colombiana. On page 14, Morison writes:Besides these documents from which we may glean facts about Christopher's early life, there are others which identify the Discoverer as the son of Domenico the wool weaver, beyond the possibility of doubt. For instance, Domenico had a brother Antonio, like him a respectable member of the lower middle class in Genoa. Antonio had three sons: Matteo, Amigeto and Giovanni, who was generally known as Giannetto (the Genoese equivalent of \"Johnny\"). Giannetto, like Christopher, gave up a humdrum occupation to follow the sea. In 1496 the three brothers met in a notary's office at Genoa and agreed that Johnny should go to Spain and seek out his first cousin \"Don Cristoforo de Colombo, Admiral of the King of Spain,\" each contributing one third of the traveling expenses. This quest for a job was highly successful. The Admiral gave Johnny command of a caravel on the Third Voyage to America, and entrusted him with confidential matters as well.\n\nOn the topic of Columbus's being born somewhere besides Genoa, Morison states: Every contemporary Spaniard or Portuguese who wrote about Columbus and his discoveries calls him Genoese. Four contemporary Genoese chroniclers claim him as a compatriot. Every early map on which his nationality is recorded describes him as Genoese or Ligur, a citizen of the Ligurian Republic. Nobody in the Admiral's lifetime, or for three centuries after, had any doubt about his birthplace.\n\nPaolo Emilio Taviani, in his book Cristoforo Colombo: Genius of the Sea discusses \"the public and notarial acts \u2013 original copies of which are conserved in the archives of Genoa and Savona \u2013 regarding Columbus's father, Columbus himself, his grandfather, and his relatives.\" In Columbus the Great Adventure he further claims that Columbus named the small island of Saona \"to honor Michele da Cuneo, his friend from Savona.\"\nThis is fully accepted by Consuelo Varela Bueno, \"Spain's leading authority on the texts, documents, and handwriting of Columbus.\" She devotes several pages to the question of Columbus native land, and concludes that \"all chroniclers of that period wrote that he was from Liguria in northern Italy.\" The evidence supporting the Genoese origin of Columbus is also discussed by Miles H. Davidson. In his book Columbus Then and Now: A Life Reexamined, he writes:Diego M\u00e9ndez, one of his captains, in testimony given in the ''Pleitos'', he said that Columbus was \"Genoese, a native of Savona which is a town near Genoa.\" Those who reject this and the more than ample other contemporary evidence, given by both Italian and Spanish sources as well as by witnesses at these court hearings, are simply flying in the face of overwhelming evidence. [...] What is the reason behind so much futile speculation? It can be mostly attributed to parochialism. Each of the nations and cities mentioned wants to claim him for its own. Since no effort was made to locate the supporting data until the early nineteenth century, and since at that time not all of the archives had been adequately researched, there was, initially, justification for those early efforts to establish who he was and where he came from. To do so today is to fulfill Montaigne's maxim, \"No one is exempt from talking non-sense; the misfortune is to do it solemnly.\"\n\n Language \nThe spoken language of Genova and the Ligurian coast would primarily have been the Ligurian language. The Italian language was originally based on the fourteenth century vernacular of Florence in the adjacent region of Tuscany, and would not have been the main spoken language of Genova in the fifteenth century.\n\nAlthough Columbus wrote almost exclusively in Spanish, there is a small handwritten Genoese gloss in a 1498 Italian (from Venice) edition of Pliny's Natural History that he read after his second voyage to America: this shows Columbus was able to write in Genoese and read Italian. There is also a note in Italian in his own Book of Prophecies exhibiting, according to historian August Kling, \"characteristics of northern Italian humanism in its calligraphy, syntax, and spelling\". Phillips and Phillips point out that 500 years ago, the Romance languages had not distanced themselves to the degree they have today. Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas in his Historia de las Indias claimed that Columbus did not know Spanish well and that he was not born in Castile.\n\nValiant scholars have dedicated themselves to the subject of Christopher Columbus's language. They have conducted in-depth research both on the ship's log and on other writings of his that have come down to the modern day. They have analyzed the words, the terms, and the vocabulary, as well as rather frequent variations often bizarre in style, handwriting, grammar, and syntax. Christopher Columbus's language is Castilian punctuated by noteworthy and frequent Portuguese, Italian, and Genoese influences and elements.\n\n Iberian origin \nCrypto-Judaism \nSalvador de Madariaga argued in 1940, that Columbus was a marrano forced to leave Spain for Genoa. Different scholars like Jose Erugo, Celso Garcia de la Riega, Otero Sanchez and Nicholas Dias Perez have since concluded that Columbus may have had a Jewish background. This hypothesis is founded on many observations about Columbus, for example: his reference to the expulsion of the Jews in his first accounts, the reference to the Second Temple of Jerusalem by the Hebraic term \"Second House\", the Hebrew letters bet-hei (meaning B'ezrat hashem) on all but one of his letters to his son, and an anagram that was a cryptic substitute for the Kaddish, according to Cecil Roth. \n\nSecondly, another evidence is reflected by the fact that all the personalities who supported Columbus before the kings are of Jewish origin and that his voyage was mainly funded by two Jewish conversos and a prominent Jew: Luis de Sant\u00e1ngel, Gabriel Sanchez, and Don Isaac Abrabanel, respectively.\n\nPrior to 1892, the Church demanded from all dioceses all existing documentation on Christopher Columbus. Once all the documentation was received at the Vatican, the beatification process never began, according to proponents of Jewish theory because they realized that Columbus was Jewish.\n\nIn a 1973 book, Simon Wiesenthal postulated that Columbus was a Sephardi, careful to conceal his Judaism yet also eager to locate a place of refuge for his persecuted fellow countrymen. Wiesenthal argued that Columbus's concept of sailing west to reach the Indies was less the result of geographical theories than of his faith in certain Biblical texts\u2014specifically the Book of Isaiah. He repeatedly cited two verses from that book: \"Surely the isles shall wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish first, to bring thy sons from far, their silver and their gold with them,\" (60:9); and \"For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth\" (65:17). Wiesenthal claimed that Columbus felt that his voyages had confirmed these prophecies. Jane Francis Amler shared those views in 1977. Estelle Irizarry echoed this as well, further noting that Columbus always wrote in Spanish, occasionally included Hebrew in his writing, and referenced the Jewish High Holidays in his journal during the first voyage.\n\nA document suggests that Columbus belonged to a Marrano family from Majorcan origin. However the authenticity of the document hasn't been proved. The novelist Robert Graves argued: \"his surname is still common in the island.\"\n\n Catalan \nSince the early 20th century, researchers have attempted to connect Columbus to the Catalan-speaking areas of Spain, usually based on linguistic evidence. The first to propose a birthplace under the Crown of Aragon was Peruvian historian Luis Ulloa in a  book originally published in 1927 in French. Antonio Ballesteros Beretta, University of Madrid historian of America, said that Ulloa's \"fiery imagination\" had placed abstruse interpretations on court documents to support his thesis, had found no positive proof, and had dismissed as false any evidence supporting a Genoese origin.\n\nThroughout Columbus's life, he referred to himself as Christobal Colom; his contemporaries and family also referred to him as such. It is possible that Colom is the shortened form of Columbus used for the Italian surname Colombo (which means \"dove\"). Colom can also be a Portuguese, French, or Catalan name, and in the latter means \"dove\". \nSome more recent studies also state Columbus had Catalan origins, based on his handwriting, though these have been disputed. Charles J. Merrill, a specialist in medieval Catalan literature at Mount St. Mary's University, claims Columbus's handwriting is typical of a native Catalan, and his mistakes in Castilian are \"most likely\" transfer errors from Catalan, with examples such as \"a todo arreo\" (a tot arreu), \"todo de un golpe\" (tot d'un cop), \"setcentas\" (set-centes), \"nombre\" (instead of n\u00famero), \"al sol puesto\" (el sol post). Merrill states that the Genoese Cristoforo Colombo was a modest wool carder and cheese merchant with no maritime training and whose age does not match the one of Columbus. Merrill's book Colom of Catalonia was published in 2008.\n\n Portugal \n\nPatroc\u00ednio Ribeiro claimed that Columbus was Portuguese in 1916, and Mois\u00e9s Bensabat Amzalak hypothesized on Columbus's signature with the Kabbalah. Based on those theories, Jos\u00e9 Mascarenhas Barreto argued in 1988, that Columbus was a Portuguese agent who hatched up an elaborate diversion to keep the Spanish from the lucrative trade routes, and suggested he was born in Cuba, Portugal, while his real name was supposedly Salvador Fernandes Zarco''. However, the genealogy presented has been disputed\n\nProponents of the Portuguese hypothesis also point to a court document which stated that Columbus's nationality was \"Portuguese\" and in another Columbus uses the words \"my homeland\" in relation to Portugal.\n\nOther theories \nOther theories claim that Columbus was a Byzantine Greek nobleman, a Sardinian nobleman, a Norwegian, a Scot, or that he was the son of King W\u0142adys\u0142aw III of Varna. Many cities have been hypothesized as the birthplace of Columbus, notably Calvi in Corsica, which in Columbus's times was under Genoese rule. \n\nBritish historian Felipe Fern\u00e1ndez-Armesto, writes in his book:The Catalan, French, Galician, Greek, Ibizan, Jewish, Majorcan, Scottish, and other Columbuses concocted by historical fantasists are agenda-driven creations, usually inspired by a desire to arrogate a supposed or confected hero to the cause of a particular nation or historic community \u2013 or, more often than not, to some immigrant group striving to establish a special place of esteem in the United States. The evidence of Columbus's origins in Genoa is overwhelming: almost no other figure of his class or designation has left so clear a paper trail in the archives.\n\nDNA study \nAn international DNA study aimed at determining Columbus's origins was begun in 2021, using the remains in Seville.\n\nFootnotes\n\nReferences \n\nColumbus family\nChristopher Columbus\nColumbus, Christopher\nColumbus, Christopher", "machine_text": "Origin theories of Christopher Columbus Christopher Columbus was an Italian explorer who is credited with discovering the New World. However, the exact origin of Columbus has been the source of much debate and controversy. There are various origin theories surrounding this famous explorer of the 15th century. Theory 1: Genoese Origin One of the most widely accepted origin theories of Christopher Columbus was that he was a Genoese. This theory states that Columbus was born in the seaport Genoa in Italy in 1451. According to this theory, Columbus was from a working-class family of weavers and wool-workers. This theory is supported by various historians who have studied Columbus' life, including Horacio F. Crespo, who wrote a book about this theory. Theory 2: Spanish Origin Another theory suggests that Columbus may have been Spanish rather than Italian. This theory suggests that Columbus was born in the Spanish region of Galicia, and that he came from a family of local nobility. Some historians believe that Columbus was taught to speak Spanish before Italian, and that he may have even been a Spanish spy sent to explore the Americas. Theory 3: Portuguese Origin Another theory is that Columbus may have been of Portuguese origin. This theory suggests that Columbus was born in Portugal and that his family was of noble descent. Supporters of this theory argue that Columbus' knowledge of Portuguese and his close relationship with the Portuguese royal family is evidence of his Portuguese roots. Despite the debate surrounding Christopher Columbus' origins, there is little doubt that he played a significant role in world history. His discovery of the Americas changed the world forever, and he will forever be remembered as one of the greatest explorers of all time.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 7374488}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story (soundtrack)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story is the soundtrack album to the 2016 Hindi-language film of the same name directed by Neeraj Pandey. Based on the life of former Indian cricketer MS Dhoni, the film stars Sushant Singh Rajput as Dhoni along with Disha Patani, Kiara Advani, and Anupam Kher in pivotal roles. The album consists of nine songs composed by Amaal Mallik in his first album as a solo composer, with one song being composed by Rochak Kohli as a guest composer, featuring lyrics written by Manoj Muntashir. The vocals were performed by Armaan Malik, Arijit Singh, Siddharth Basrur, Rochak Kohli, Palak Muchhal, Ananya Nanda and Adithyan A. Prithviraj. The background music was composed by Sanjoy Chowdhury.\n\nThe album was recorded entirely using live instrumentation and has only one soundscape used considering the theme of the film. After M. M. Kreem, whom collaborated with Pandey for the soundtracks: Special 26 and Baby, refused his offer on his priorities with Baahubali: The Beginning (the first film in Rajamouli's Baahubali franchise) despite composing one promotional single, Pandey chose Amaal Malik for the film soundtrack and initially recorded six songs within March\u2014October 2015. No lip-syncing is used in the songs, as the team believed that the songs blend in the narrative. The album released in Tamil, Telugu and Marathi with the lyrics were penned by Pa. Vijay, Chaitanya Prasad and Guru Thakur for the respective languages. Out of the seven songs, a promotional track \"Har Gully Mein Dhoni Hai\" (also released in Tamil) and two alternate versions of the songs were used in Hindi version, while the Telugu and Marathi album have seven tracks.\n\nThe album opened to positive reviews from critics, praising Amaal Malik for using single soundscape and retaining the freshness and melody in the tracks, but criticised for the familiarity of the tunes. The tracks \"Besabriyaan\", \"Kaun Tujhe\", \"Phir Kabhi\" and \"Har Gully Mein Dhoni Hai\" received the most consumer response and Palak Muchhal, the singer of \"Kaun Tujhe\" received a News18 and Screen Award for Best Female Playback Singer respectively.\n\nProduction \nInitially Neeraj Pandey planned to rope in M. M. Kreem as the composer for the film's soundtrack, after whom the director worked with him in Special 26 (2013) and Baby (2015). Kreem also composed the promotional track \"Phir Se\" written by Manoj Muntashir and recorded by Divya Kumar, for the 2015 Cricket World Cup and dedicated the song to the Indian cricket team. Pandey being a cricket buff said that the idea was \"to sum up the mood and emotion for the entire nation\" and called the song as a \"tribute to the inherent passion our players have for the country and the love we have towards our own team\". Both the director and the composer worked on the song and video in short span of time so as to release the track before the tournament which begins on 14 February 2015. The song received overwhelmingly positive response and Pandey eventually planned to rope Kreem as the composer. But, Kreem's commitments on Baahubali franchise led Pandey to choose a different composer for the songs. When Pandey listened to the song \"Sooraj Dooba Hain\" from the film Roy (2015), Pandey eventually approached the composer of the song, Amaal Malik to work for the biopic's songs along with Bhushan Kumar, the chairman and managing director of T-Series. Malik had eventually composed two single songs for the label \u2014  \"Chal Wahan Jaate Hain\" and \"Zindagi Aa Raha Hoon Main\" \u2014 both of them featured Tiger Shroff as the lead.\n\nAmaal Malik composed 25 songs in his film career when he was being a part of multi-composer soundtracks for films, but this was his first album as a solo composer. Initially, the team had planned for a multi-composer setup for the songs in the film, but as Amaal Malik composed the first track \"Besabriyaan\", the team decided to retain him as the composer for the soundtrack. Within October 2015, Malik finished composing six tracks for the film's soundtrack with three of them being romantic numbers which highlighted Dhoni's relationship with his wife Sakshi Dhoni, from the time they first meet to post marriage. Bhushan made Malik sit for nights explaining him the feel and requirement of each song in the film. The album does not have the characters lip-syncing to the songs but will play in the background as they wanted the score to complement the cricketer's image and the album was further recorded with live instruments.\n\nMalik said that the seven songs have \"fine blend of rock and orchestral elements\". He explained that \"The album maintains a balance between commercial and the inspirational aspect, even if one has not seen the movie, they would still be able to relate to the songs, which is why the songs work as stand-alone tracks\"; also adding that the album maintains a single sort of soundscape, which he called as the \"most difficult to crack\", calling the film as \"one of his toughest projects in his career\".\n\nAlbum information \nThe track \"Besabriyaan\" which was the first to be composed which is about Dhoni's early life that how he juggled between studies and cricket simultaneously. The second song \"Kaun Tujhe\" is about the relationship with his late girlfriend Priyanka Jha, who died in a tragic accident in 2002. The third song from the film entitled \"Jab Tak\" is about Dhoni's first meeting with his wife Sakshi in the film. Rochak Kohli was announced as the guest composer for the film's soundtrack and composed a promotional single titled \"Har Gully Mein Dhoni Hai\" which is about the craze of cricket in India and public opinion about the sport. It was initially started as the theme of street cricket in India, but Kohli described the song as \"a tribute to dreams and the fight to achieve the dreams\". He further described the song as \"a metaphor for everyone in India who has the potential to rise above their immediate realities to achieve them\" and as \"an emotional song that connects to everyone, in every by-lane of the country, with the hope and passion to succeed\". This song was released in Tamil as \"Ulagam Engum Dhoni Ye\" sung by S. P. Charan and lyrics written by Pa. Vijay. However, it was not featured in the Telugu and Marathi versions of the soundtracks. The promotional song \"Phir Se\" which was made by M. M. Kreem for the 2015 Cricket World Cup was not included in the film.\n\nReception \nWriting for The Times of India, Rinky Kumar gave the soundtrack album a rating 3 out of 5 adding: \"the album has a mixed bag of tracks, some of which make quite an impression and while others are nothing to write home about\". Surabhi Redkar of Koimoi also rated 3 out of 5, calling the album as \"quite decent\" and praised Amaal Malik for a \"great effort in his first solo album\". Writing for India Today, Devarsi Ghosh added that: \"the album has a few stock market-friendly hit-gaana type numbers, every once in a while, Amaal tries to move away from monotony and do something interesting\". Critic based at Daily News and Analysis praised Amaal Malik for the use of live instruments in the film's soundtrack, calling it as \"a more full-blooded feel\", and further added that \"the album has a couple of snags, but that could not stop the album's winning inning\".\n\nJoginder Tuteja of Bollywood Hungama rated the album 4.5 out of 5 saying \"The music of M.S. Dhoni is good and there is nothing unlikeable about it. Though one doesn't expect the music to become chartbuster from a long term musical experience, in the context of the film most of them should fit in well.\" Devesh Sharma of Filmfare gave a 4 out of 5 rating to the soundtrack saying \"Amaal Mallik makes his mark as a solo music director\". A critic from India.com said that \"there is some not-so-wow kind of songs too, but the album will still be liked \u2013 thanks to the soft romantic tracks\". Manish Gaekwad of Scroll.in called that \"Mallik has a hit strike rate with the mushy numbers, but he has his work cut out for him if he wants to diversify into other styles\". Critic Gaurang Chauhan of BollywoodLife.com said that the album has \"quite a few hummable tunes to it\" and called the album as a \"must listen for all the romantic hearts\". A critic from Behindwoods gave the album 3 out of 5 calling it as \"an impressive album which stays perfectly true to the film's genre\". Vipin Nair of Music Aloud criticised the soundtrack saying it as \"the album is largely marred by the familiarity in its tunes\", with a rating of 2.5 out of 5. Megha Mathur of The Quint opined that \"Amaal Mallik's compositions are not as dynamic or disruptive as the film's protagonist, despite few long lasting melodies\". She further called that \"The OST falls short of making the biopic a spectacular experience\".\n\nTrack listing\n\nHindi\n\nTamil\n\nTelugu\n\nMarathi\n\nRelease history\n\nChart performance \n\n Weekly charts\n\n Year-end charts\n\nAccolades\n\nPersonnel \nCredits adapted from CD liner notes\n\n Amaal Mallik \u2013 Composer (All tracks), musical arrangements (All tracks)\n Meghdeep Bose \u2013 Music producer (Track 1,2,3,10), acoustic guitar (Track 1,2,10)\n Sourav Roy \u2013 Music producer (Track 4)\n Keshav Dhar \u2013 Music producer (Track 5), electric guitar (Track 5)\n Ankur Mukherjee \u2013 Music producer (Track 5), acoustic guitar (Track 1,2,6,10), live guitar (Track 4), ukulele (Track 4)\n Jim Sathya \u2013 Music producer (Track 6)\n Aditya Dev \u2013 Music producer (Track 7)\n Rochak Kohli \u2013 Music producer (Track 8)\n Joell Mukherji \u2013 Music producer (Track 9), acoustic guitar (Track 9), electric guitar (Track 9)\n Armaan Malik \u2013 Acoustic guitar (Track 4), electric guitar (Track 5)\n Dev Arijit \u2013 Acoustic guitar (Track 8)\n Mohit Dogra \u2013 Acoustic guitar (Track 8)\n Rushad Mistry \u2013 Bass guitar (Track 1,6)\n Jeeni Dutta \u2013 Electric guitar (Track 5)\n Jai Row Kavi \u2013 Drums (Track 5)\n Sivamani \u2013 Drums (Track 8), percussions (Track 8)\n Firoz Khan \u2013 Keys (Track 8)\n Krishna Jhaveri \u2013 Bass (Track 5)\n Omkar Dhumal \u2013 Shehnai (Track 7)\n Tejas Vinchurkar \u2013 Flute (Track 1,2,10), Woodwinds (Track 1)\n Suresh Lalwani \u2013 Strings (CMA Musicians, Mumbai) [Track 1,3]\n Dipesh Varma \u2013 Live rhythm (Track 7), live percussions (Track 7)\n Daboo Malik \u2013 Live rhythm (Track 7), live percussions (Track 7)\n Omkar Salunkhe \u2013 Live rhythm (Track 7)\n Keyur Barve \u2013 Live rhythm (Track 7)\n Amey Londhe \u2013 Vocal recording (Audio Garage, Mumbai) [Track 1,5]\n Vincent Joseph \u2013 Vocal recording (Audio Garage, Mumbai) [Track 1,5]\n Surajit Ghoshmazumdar \u2013 Vocal recording (T-Series Studios, Mumbai) [Track 2]\n Rahul Sharma \u2013 Vocal recording (Asia Music Vision, Mumbai) [Track 4]\n Akshay Kamat \u2013 Vocal recording (RK Music Labs, Mumbai) [Track 8], music assistance\n Vijay Dayal \u2013 Live instrumentation recording (YRF Studios, Mumbai) [Track 1,2,6,10], vocal recording (YRF Studios, Mumbai) [Track 3,6,10]\n Chinmay Mestry \u2013 Live instrumentation recording (YRF Studios, Mumbai) [Track 1,2,6,10], vocal recording (YRF Studios, Mumbai) [Track 3,6,10]\n Shantanu Hudlikar \u2013 Live instrumentation recording (YRF Studios, Mumbai) [Track 1,3,5]\n Abhishek Khandelwal \u2013 Live instrumentation recording (YRF Studios, Mumbai) [Track 1,3,5]\n Manasi Tare \u2013 Live instrumentation recording (YRF Studios, Mumbai) [Track 1,3,5]\n Julian Mascarenhas \u2013 Live instrumentation recording (Enzy Studios, Mumbai) [Track 4,8]\n Eric Pillai \u2013 Audio mixing (Future Sound of Bombay, Mumbai) [All tracks], mastering (Future Sound of Bombay, Mumbai) [All tracks]\n Bharat Goel \u2013 Audio mixing (Global Sound Labs, Mumbai) [Track 8], mastering (Global Sound Labs, Mumbai) [Track 8]\n Ninad Lad \u2013 Audio mixing (Orbis Studio, Mumbai) [Track 9], live instrumentation recording (Orbis Studio, Mumbai) [Track 9]\n Donal Whelan \u2013 Audio mastering (Mastering World, London) [Track 9]\n Michael Edwin Pillai \u2013 Mixing assistance (Future Sound of Bombay, Mumbai)\n Shayan Chakraborty \u2013 Mixing assistance (Orbis Studio, Mumbai)\n Krish Trivedi \u2013 Music assistance\n Sid 'Sky' Singh \u2013 Music assistance\n Yash Narvekar \u2013 Music assistance\n Zaid Patni \u2013 Music assistance\n Shishir A Samant \u2013 Music assistance\n Gaurav Sanghvi \u2013 Music assistance\n Anvay Patil \u2013 Music assistance\n Rujul Deolikar \u2013 Music assistance\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\n \n2016 soundtrack albums\nHindi film soundtracks\nTamil film soundtracks\nTelugu film soundtracks\nT-Series (company) soundtrack albums\nSports film soundtracks\nBiographical film soundtracks", "machine_text": "M.S.

Thompson and horticulturalist Frederic Heutte. In 1938, the pair were granted  of high, wooded ground plus  of reservoir for a city garden. Later that year, under a Works Progress Administration (WPA) grant, 200 African-American women and 20 men cleared the site. By March 1939, 4,000 azaleas, 2,000 rhododendrons, several thousand miscellaneous shrubs and trees, and 100 bushels of daffodils had been planted. and another grant was quickly secured to expand the garden.\n\nIn 1958, the Old Dominion Horticultural Society took over maintenance and changed the garden's name to Norfolk Botanical Garden.

The Chayanda field covers an area of about 1,130 square kilometers and has estimated reserves of 1.2 trillion cubic meters of natural gas and 61 million metric tons of oil. The gas is predominantly composed of methane, with small amounts of ethane, propane, and butane. The field is operated by Gazprom, the largest extractor of natural gas in the world. Gazprom started constructing infrastructure for the field in 2014, which includes a gas plant and a 3,000 kilometer-long pipeline called the Power of Siberia. The pipeline connects the Chayanda field to China's northeast region, where there is a huge demand for energy. The Power of Siberia pipeline has a maximum capacity of 38 billion cubic meters of gas per year. The Chayanda field has faced several environmental concerns due to its location in a pristine environment, which is important for the survival of the endangered Siberian tiger and other wildlife.

The facility will be the new permanent training and administrative home of professional Australian Football League club the Brisbane Lions, and will also play host to the club's AFL Women's home matches.\n\nHistory\nThe City of Ipswich has a long association with Australian rules, with some of the earliest matches in the 1860s played there as well as interstate matches between Queensland and New South Wales played at the North Ipswich Reserve. Since the collapse of the local competition in the 1890s it became a stronghold for rugby league and soccer. Although it hasn't been played continuously in the area, Australian rules has seen a resurgence since the 1950s and 1960s current clubs date back to this time. In recent years, the western growth corridor had seen a boom in participation and it has produced professional players for the Brisbane Lions, including Rhan Hooper (played for the Ipswich Eagles), Sean Yoshiura and Dakota Davidson (AFLW).\n\nSince its creation as an amalgamated team in 1996, the Brisbane Lions have always trained at the 42,000-seat Gabba during the football season, which is the senior men's team home ground. During the off-season, the Lions usually shifted training sessions to grounds at Giffin Park in Coorparoo, Burpengary and elsewhere, meaning the club lacked a dedicated and permanent home year-round. When the club entered a women's team in the AFL Women's (AFLW) competition in 2017, it played home matches in Burpengary in the north of Brisbane and at Hickey Park in Stafford. Consequently the club sought to establish a permanent training and administrative base for the senior men's team that could also host AFLW and reserves matches.\n\nIn 2018, the club settled on vacant land in Springfield. A total of $70 million was required for construction of the facility. The Lions and the AFL contributed $10m, Ipswich Council $12m, Springfield Land Corporation $18m and the Queensland Government $15m. The final $15m stream of funding was secured from the Federal Government in late January 2019, allowing earthworks and preliminary construction of the facility to commence later that year. Major construction commenced in March 2020 and the venue is scheduled to be completed in late 2022.\n\nFacility\nThe Reserve's main oval will have a capacity of up to 10,000, with several rows of seating around the perimeter, an administration building which includes grandstand seating for 1,000 and balconies surrounding half the ground, grass hill at the other end, four light towers and a scoreboard. A second and smaller oval located directly across the main oval will also be incorporated for use by the Lions.\n\nThe broader precinct will encompass training and administration facilities catering for the men's and women's elite players, such as a high-performance gymnasium, extensive learning and teaching facilities, lap pool, aquatic recovery pools, and a cafe and other spaces for community use.\n\nNaming rights\nIn May 2021 the Brisbane Lions announced that The Reserve would be known for commercial purposes as Brighton Homes Arena, in a deal signed with home construction company Brighton Homes. The playing surface has been named the Michael Voss Oval, in recognition of the club's triple-premiership men's captain.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nOfficial site\n\n2021 establishments in Australia\nSports venues completed in 2021\nAustralian rules football grounds\nSports venues in Queensland\nSport in Ipswich, Queensland\nBrisbane Lions\nAFL Women's grounds\nVenues of the 2032 Summer Olympics and Paralympics\nProposed sports venues in Australia\nStadiums under construction", "machine_text": "The Reserve is a residential neighborhood located in Springfield, Missouri, in the United States.

He composed the jazz and pop standards \"Snowfall\" and \"I Wish I Had You\".\n\nEarly years\nThornhill was the son of J. Chester Thornhill and his wife, Maude. When he was 11 years old, he played piano professionally. While still a youth, he played with two local combos. As a student at Garfield High School in Terre Haute, he played with several theater bands. Thornhill entered the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music at the age of 16. He also studied at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia.\n\nCareer\nAs a youth, he was recognized as an extraordinary talent and formed a traveling duo with Danny Polo, a musical prodigy on the clarinet and trumpet from nearby Clinton, Indiana.\n\nHe and clarinetist Artie Shaw started their careers at the Golden Pheasant in Cleveland, Ohio, with the Austin Wylie Orchestra. Thornhill and Shaw went to New York together in 1931. Thornhill went to the West Coast in the late 1930s with the Bob Hope Radio Show and arranged for Judy Garland in Babes in Arms. In 1935, he played on sessions with Glenn Miller, including \"Solo Hop\", which was released on Columbia Records. He also played with Paul Whiteman, Benny Goodman, Ray Noble, and Billie Holiday. He arranged \"Loch Lomond\" and \"Annie Laurie\" for Maxine Sullivan.\n\nDuring the mid-1930s, Thornhill arranged and played piano for Andre Kostelanetz.\n\nIn 1939, he founded the Claude Thornhill Orchestra. Polo was his lead clarinet player. Although the Thornhill band was a sophisticated dance band, it became known for its superior jazz musicians and for Thornhill's and Gil Evans's arrangements. The band played without vibrato, so that the timbres of the instruments could be better appreciated. Thornhill encouraged the musicians to develop cool-sounding tones. The band was popular with both musicians and the public. Miles Davis's Birth of the Cool nonet was modeled in part on Thornhill's sound and unconventional instrumentation. The band's most successful records were \"Snowfall\", \"A Sunday Kind of Love\", and \"Love for Love\".\n\nThornhill was playing at the Paramount Theater in New York for $10,000 a week when he enlisted in the U.S. Navy as an apprentice seaman on October 26, 1942. As chief musician, he performed shows across the Pacific Theater with Jackie Cooper as his drummer and Dennis Day as his vocalist.\n\nIn 1946, he was discharged from the Navy and reunited his ensemble. Polo, Gerry Mulligan, and Barry Galbraith returned with new members, Red Rodney, Lee Konitz, Joe Shulman, and Bill Barber. Thornhill and his orchestra played for the Judy, Jill and Johnny variety program on radio on the Mutual Broadcasting System in 1946\u20131947.\n\nIn 1957, Thornhill became Tony Bennett's musical director. He offered his big band library to Gerry Mulligan when Mulligan formed the Concert Jazz Band, but Mulligan declined the gift, since his instrumentation was different. A large portion of his extensive library of music is currently held by Drury University in Springfield, Missouri.\n\nThornhill died of a heart attack in Caldwell, New Jersey, at the age of 56. In 1984, he was posthumously inducted into the Big Band and Jazz Hall of Fame.\n\nCompositions \n\nThornhill's compositions included the standard \"Snowfall\", \"I Wish I Had You\", recorded by Billie Holiday and Fats Waller, \"Let's Go\", \"Shore Road\", \"Portrait of a Guinea Farm\", \"Lodge Podge\", \"Rustle of Spring\", \"It's Time for Us to Part\", \"It Was a Lover and His Lass\", \"The Little Red Man\", \"Memory of an Island\", and \"Where Has My Little Dog Gone?\"\n\nCover versions of \"Snowfall\"\nThornhill's 1941 piano composition \"Snowfall\", later had lyrics written by his wife, Ruth Thornhill.

It was discovered on 7 October 1986, by American astronomer Edward Bowell at Lowell's Anderson Mesa Station, near Flagstaff, Arizona. The asteroid was named after American amateur astronomer Leslie Peltier.\n\nOrbit and classification \n\nIn the SMASS taxonomy, Peltier is a V-type asteroid but possesses the orbital characteristics of a member of the Flora family, which is one of the largest groups of stony S-type asteroids in the main-belt. It is therefore thought to be an unrelated interloper that does not origin from the Flora family's parent body. Peltier orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 1.9\u20132.6\u00a0AU once every 3 years and 4 months (1,220 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.16 and an inclination of 5\u00b0 with respect to the ecliptic. In 1949, it was first identified as  at Johannesburg. The body's observation arc begins at Crimea-Nauchnij in 1979, when it was identified as , 10 years prior to its official discovery observation at Anderson Mesa.\n\nPhysical characteristics\n\nRotation period \n\nA rotational lightcurve of Peltier was obtained by Czech astronomer Petr Pravec at Ond\u0159ejov Observatory in October 2006. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of 2.4287 hours with a brightness variation of 0.09 magnitude (). In December 2013, photometric observations by Australian amateur astronomer Julian Oey gave a concurring period of 2.4289 hours and an amplitude of 0.10 magnitude ().\n\nDiameter and albedo \n\nPeltier has not been observed by any space-based surveys such as the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite, or NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for V-type asteroids of 0.40 and calculates a diameter of 4.00 kilometers using an absolute magnitude of 13.6.\n\nNaming \n\nThis minor planet was named in memory of American amateur astronomer Leslie Peltier (1900\u20131980), who has discovered 12 comets and several novae including Nova Herculis 1963.

G. Bowell at the Anderson Mesa Station of Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, United States. The asteroid, classified as a stony S-type, has a diameter of approximately 5.6 kilometers and an albedo of 0.25, which means it reflects about 25% of the sunlight it receives. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.38 astronomical units (AU) once every 3 years and 8 months (1,354 days), with an inclination of 2.9 degrees to the ecliptic plane. Its orbit has a low eccentricity of 0.09, which means it travels around the Sun in a nearly circular path. The name Peltier was chosen by the discoverer in honor of French physicist Jean Charles Athanase Peltier (1785\u20131845), who discovered the Peltier effect in 1834, a phenomenon where a thermoelectric current is produced at the junction of two different metals when subjected to a temperature difference. Peltier's work laid the foundation for the development of thermoelectric cooling devices, which are used today in a variety of applications ranging from refrigeration to electronic component cooling. The asteroid 3850 Peltier, like many other asteroids in the main belt, has not been observed to exhibit any unusual characteristics or meet the criteria for further study or exploration. Nonetheless, the discovery and naming of this asteroid serves as a tribute to the contributions of Jean Charles Athanase Peltier to science and technology.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 697432}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Bracket creep\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Bracket creep is usually defined as the process by which inflation pushes wages and salaries into higher tax brackets, leading to fiscal drag. However, even if there is only one tax bracket, or one remains within the same tax bracket, there will still be bracket creep resulting in a higher proportion of income being paid in tax. That is, although the marginal tax rate remains unchanged with inflation, the average tax rate will increase.\n\nMost progressive tax systems are not adjusted for inflation. As wages and salaries rise in nominal terms under the influence of inflation they become more highly taxed, even though in real terms the value of the wages and salaries has not increased at all. The net effect is that in real terms taxes rise unless the tax rates or brackets are adjusted to compensate.\n\nExamples\nSuppose a person earns $20,000 per year and is liable to 20% tax on earnings above a threshold of $5,000 per year. Then they pay ($20,000\u2013$5,000)*0.2 = $3,000 in taxes, or 15% of their income. Now suppose that due to inflation, their wage goes up by 5%, but the government does not increase the tax threshold. They must now pay ($21,000\u2013$5,000)*0.2 = $3,200 or 15.2% of their income as tax. Thus the proportion of the person's income that is paid as tax has increased. The average tax rate went up even though the tax payer remained in the 20% tax bracket. That is, the marginal tax rate did not change. Since the wage increase was due to inflation, the person's net real income declined.\n\nIn the United States, the Alternative Minimum Tax originally (1971) targeted 155 high-income households; based on 2004 law, it would affect 20% of households by 2010.\n\nPolitical dimension\nNominal bracket creep can easily be countered by a system of index-linked tax brackets, but this may be politically undesirable. Many voters do not perceive the effects of bracket creep, and so the government may prefer to adjust tax brackets manually once every few years: in effect, restoring the real tax rates to their approximate pre-inflation levels but in a way that gives the government the appearance that they are cutting taxes. Not surprisingly, such changes are usually made right before a general election is to be held.\n\nReferences\n\nIncome taxes\nInflation", "machine_text": "Bracket creep is a term used to describe the gradual increase in an individual's tax liability due to inflation. It occurs when a person's income increases just enough to push them into a higher tax bracket, even though their real buying power has not changed. This phenomenon is often referred to as \"creeping\" because it happens slowly over time and may go unnoticed by workers and policymakers. Bracket creep occurs when a country's tax system uses fixed tax brackets that are not indexed to inflation. As prices rise, wages and salaries rise too, putting taxpayers into higher income tax brackets without any real increase in their purchasing power. The result is that taxpayers end up paying more in taxes than they should. To illustrate this, let's say a person earns $50,000 a year in 2021 and is taxed at a rate of 20%. In 2022, that person's salary increases to $52,000 due to inflation. However, the tax brackets have not changed, so that person is now taxed at a rate of 22% on the additional $2,000 of income. This means that even though their real buying power has not increased, they are paying a higher rate of tax. Bracket creep has been a recurring issue in many countries, including the United States, Australia, and Canada. To combat this, some countries have implemented an inflation adjustment mechanism that automatically adjusts tax brackets to keep pace with inflation. This indexed approach ensures that taxpayers are not inadvertently pushed into higher income tax brackets simply because of rising prices. In summary, bracket creep is an issue that arises when tax rates do not keep pace with inflation. It can result in individuals paying more in taxes than they should, which can be a burden on low and middle-income earners. Governments can address this issue by indexing tax brackets to inflation, ensuring that taxpayers are not penalized for something outside of their control \u2013 rising prices.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 709199}

Heller in Salzburg. His musique concr\u00e9te work Requiem was premiered in 1975 at the Austrian Broadcasting (ORF). \nHe earned his master's (M.A.) and doctoral (Ph.D.) degrees with distinction at the Benjamin T. Rome School of Music of The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., where he was a graduate student of Conrad Bernier and Helmut Braunlich (composition), Donald Thulean (conducting), Cyrilla Barr, Ruth Steiner, and Robert M. Stevenson (musicology).\n\nRecent works\nHis original compositions have been performed in Europe and the Americas. His Misa de San Isidro (2001) for a cappella chorus was premiered in Tenerife, the Canary Islands, Spain, in 2002, and has been performed by different professional choirs at festivals in Medell\u00edn, Tokyo, and New York City. His Piano Concerto No. 1 (2005), dedicated to the Russian pianist and teacher, Alexandr Sklioutovski, was premiered in June, 2006 at the National Theatre in Guatemala City by Jos\u00e9 Pablo Quesada as soloist and the Millennium Orchestra, the composer conducting. In 2007, it was performed to critical acclaim and great enthusiasm at the National Theatre in San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica, again with pianist Quesada and the composer conducting the National University Symphony Orchestra. Quesada also performed it at the 15th Latin American Music Festival in Caracas, Venezuela in May, 2008, with the National Philharmonic Orchestra of Venezuela. Lehnhoff's Piano Concerto No. 2 (2007) was very successfully premiered in August, 2008 in Guatemala City by concert pianist Sergio Sand\u00ed, with the combined Millennium Orchestra and Bachensemble Leipzig, the composer conducting. The concertos are written in a personal, highly original post-modern style in which contemporary art-music idioms and techniques, but also blues, tango, and jazz influences can be traced. His aphoristical twelve-tone Hai-kai for piano have attracted the attention of scholars such as the distinguished musicologist Dr. Tamara Sklioutovskaia, and have been performed by international pianists. His piano and chamber music has been performed at numerous festivals in Europe, North- and South America. His diptych Escenas primigenias was published on CD and served as a model for cinematic development. His stage work in progress Satuy\u00e9, on an own multilingual libretto, is about the Afro-Caribbean Garinagu (or Garifuna) people and their arrival at Central American shores.\n\nRevival of historical music\nHis research of the Music of Guatemala has revealed a previously unknown musical wealth, including the Maya, Renaissance, baroque, classical, romantic, 20th century, and current trends. From the early 1980s on, Dieter Lehnhoff had become interested in searching for music composed in Central America and specifically Guatemala during the Spanish rule (1524\u20131821). His research initiatives brought to light a number of compositions by Renaissance masters Hernando Franco, Pedro Berm\u00fadez, and Gaspar Fern\u00e1ndez, as well as Guatemalan baroque composers Manuel Jos\u00e9 de Quir\u00f3s, Rafael Antonio Castellanos, Pedro Antonio Rojas, and Jos\u00e9 Eulalio Samayoa. A first anthology was published in Antigua Guatemala in 1984. The music was revived in a number of concerts conducted by Lehnhoff, thus surprising the musical world with a new repertoire of high quality. The first series of digital recordings (1992\u201399), which spanned from the late Maya times to the end of the 20th century, was released as part of the monumental Historia General de Guatemala, an encyclopedic publication in six volumes written by over 150 specialists in every historical area. The series of seven CDs included premiere recordings of music from every historical period. The revival of the historic Music of Guatemala through Lehnhoff's concerts, writings, and recordings had a significant effect on the strengthening of the cultural identity of Guatemalans in times of civil confrontation and turmoil. The dissemination of his musical and historical findings at more than 40 international festivals, concerts, congresses, and meetings also helped to restore the cultural image and prestige of the country.\n\nAs a conductor, he has founded and directed various instrumental groups, orchestras, and choral groups. He has been invited to perform as a conductor, composer, lecturer, or leader of his Millennium Ensemble at over forty international festivals and concerts in Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, El Salvador, Germany, Guatemala, Japan, Mexico, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Spain, the United States, and Venezuela. He has produced a series of compact discs with premiere recordings of works by Guatemalan composers of all times.\n\nAcademic programmes\nIn the academic field he also pioneered by establishing and directing several institutions and programmes devoted to the strengthening of musical culture in Guatemala. Thus, he proposed and carried out the design and establishment of the Music Department at the Universidad del Valle de Guatemala, which offered, for the first time in the country, a Bachelor's degree and a teaching license in Music. He also established the Institute of Musicology at the Universidad Rafael Land\u00edvar , which is under his direction, and which is primarily devoted to musicological research. He has taught numerous courses in musicology, music theory, applied music, and composition. He has also been an invited professor at the doctoral programme of the National University of Costa Rica. For his extensive writings he was made a corresponding member of the Royal Spanish Academy, being also invited to join the Academies of History of Argentina, Guatemala, Puerto Rico, Spain, Uruguay, and Venezuela.\n\nHe is founder and president of the Guatemalan Music Council, affiliated to the International Music Council.\n\nSelected compositions\n\nOrchestral: \nSymphony No. 1 (1975)\nSymphony No. 2 (1990)\nConcerto for Piano and Orchestra No. 1 (2005) \nConcerto for Piano and Orchestra No. 2 (2007)\nTardes de feria (2008)\nCaribe Suite No. 1 (2009)\n\nStage: \nStreichquartett, music theatre (1974)\nMilarepa Superstar, musical (1977, score lost)\nCaribe, opera (2007\u201311)\n\nVocal-choral: \nCinco canciones criollas, own lyrics (1976)\nCantos latinos de natividad, Latin texts (1988)\nMisa de San Isidro, Latin text of the Mass ordinary (2001)\nChaaj: el juego de pelota Maya, own poem (2003)\nSalve, cara Parens, mezzo-soprano or baritone, strings, and piano, Latin poem by Rafael Land\u00edvar (2011)\n\nChamber: \nCanto IV, clarinet quartet (1985)\nIn memoriam, violin, clarinet, and cello (1989)\nSantelmo, solo violin (1990)\nCantares del Llano, string or wind quintet (1994)\nIncidente en Izabal, clarinet and marimba (1997)\nKyrieleis, string quartet (2002)\nLleg\u00f3 Pacheco, wind quintet (2004)\nTardes de feria, wind quintet (2005)\nSonata urbana, clarinet and piano, also a version for cello and piano (2010)\nM\u00fasica l\u00fadica, flute, clarinet, and piano (2012)\nSonata porte\u00f1a, flute and piano (2013)\nCaribe Suite No. 2, clarinet and string quartet (2013)\n\nPiano: \nAlbum para la juventud (1988)\nHai-kai (2001)\nDoppler (2012)\n\nElectro-acoustic: \nRequiem (1975) \nMemorias de un d\u00eda remoto (1999)\nRituales nocturnos (1999)\n\nBooks\n\n Creaci\u00f3n musical en Guatemala.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Matthew 8\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Matthew 8 is the eighth chapter of the Gospel of Matthew in the New Testament and continues the narrative about Jesus' ministry in Galilee previously described in Matthew 4:23\u201325. It follows on from the Sermon on the Mount, noting in its opening verse that Jesus had come down from the mountain where he had been teaching. There is a renewed focus in this chapter on Jesus' ministry of healing.\n\nText \n\nThe original text was written in Koine Greek.

H. Plumptre, in Anglican bishop Charles Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers, commented that the events reported \"are common to St. Mark and St. Luke, but are not narrated\u2026 in the same order\". Free Church minister William Robertson Nicoll suggested that \"this collection is not arranged in chronological order. The connection is topical, not temporal.\" In his opinion these stories \"are an integral part of the self-revelation of Jesus by word and deed; they are demonstrations not merely of His power, but above all, of His spirit\".\n\nNew Testament scholar Dale Allison notes that, along with chapter 9, these \"merciful deeds\" performed by Jesus are all undertaken for the benefit of \"people from the margins of Jewish society or without status\".\n\nSee also \n Book of Leviticus\n Leper\n Moses\n Related Bible parts: Leviticus 14, Joshua 10, Isaiah 53, Mark 1, 4 and 5, Luke 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9, John 4\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n King James Bible - Wikisource\nEnglish Translation with Parallel Latin Vulgate\nOnline Bible at GospelHall.org (ESV, KJV, Darby, American Standard Version, Bible in Basic English)\nMultiple bible versions at Bible Gateway (NKJV, NIV, NRSV etc.)\n\n \nMatthew 08", "machine_text": "Matthew 8 is the eighth chapter of the Gospel of Matthew in the New Testament of the Christian Bible. This chapter opens with the story of Jesus healing a leper, and it goes on to detail several other significant events in Jesus' ministry. In the first story of the chapter, Jesus heals a person with leprosy. This event underscores Jesus' compassion and power, as lepers were considered outcasts in ancient society. Jesus then proceeds to heal a paralyzed man, using the power of his words alone. The chapter also contains several more miracles performed by Jesus, including the healing of a Roman centurion's servant, calming a storm on the sea of Galilee, and casting demons out of two men in a cemetery. One of the most significant moments in this chapter is Jesus' encounter with two men who were possessed by demons. The demons begged Jesus to send them into a herd of pigs, which he did, and the pigs then ran down a steep bank and drowned. This event is often cited as an example of Jesus' power over evil spirits. Another important theme in Matthew 8 is Jesus' role as a healer. He is shown to have the power to cure physical ailments and to bring peace to troubled souls. This underscores his divine nature and reinforces his message of hope and salvation for all who believe in him. Overall, Matthew 8 is an important chapter in the Gospel of Matthew, illustrating Jesus' compassion, power, and role as a healer and Savior to all who seek him.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 4770637}

Rosolino declared about his beginnings as a swimmer:\nI learned to float by sheer chance at the age of 4. Instead of the common arm floating bands, they made me swim with a headboard. Unfortunately it had a hole, and by the time I finally got out of the small and deep pool, the headboard had drowned... The first real swimming course I took was when I was 6 years old, and after that, lesson by lesson, I got to the pre-competition level.

Doherty of Bell Telephone Laboratories Inc in 1936. Whereas conventional class B amplifiers can clip on high input-signal levels, the Doherty power amplifier can accommodate signals with high peak-to-average power ratios by using two amplifier circuits within the one overall amplifier to accommodate the different signal levels.  In this way, the amplifier achieves a high level of linearity while retaining good power efficiency.\n\nIn Doherty's day, within the Western Electric product line, the eponymous electronic device was operated as a linear amplifier with a driver which was modulated. In the 50,000-watt implementation, the driver was a complete 5,000-watt transmitter which could, if necessary, be operated independently of the Doherty amplifier and the Doherty amplifier was used to raise the 5,000-watt level to the required 50,000-watt level.\n\nThe amplifier was usually configured as a grounded-cathode, carrier\u2013peak amplifier using two vacuum tubes in parallel connection, one as a class B carrier tube and the other as a class B peak tube (power transistors in modern implementations). The tubes' source (driver) and load (antenna) were split and combined through +90 and \u221290 degree phase shifting networks. Alternate configurations included a grounded-grid carrier tube and a grounded-cathode peak tube whereby the driver power was effectively passed-through the carrier tube and was added to the resulting output power, but this benefit was more appropriate for the earlier and less efficient triode implementations rather than the later and more efficient tetrode implementations.\n\nSuccessor broadcast developments\nAs successor to Western Electric Company Inc. for radio broadcast transmitters, the Doherty concept was considerably refined by Continental Electronics Manufacturing Company of Dallas, Texas.\n\nEarly Continental Electronics designs, by James O. Weldon and others, retained most of the characteristics of Doherty's amplifier but added medium-level screen-grid modulation of the driver (317B, et al.).\n\nA further refinement of Doherty's amplifier was the high-level screen-grid modulation scheme invented by Joseph B. Sainton (317C, et al.).\n\nSainton's 317C series consisted of a class C carrier tube in parallel connection with a class C peak tube. The tubes' source (driver) and load (antenna) were split and combined through +90 and \u221290 degree phase-shifting networks as in Doherty's amplifier. The unmodulated radio frequency carrier was applied to the control grids of both tubes with the same control grid bias points. Carrier modulation was applied to the screen grids of both tubes, but the screen grid bias points of the carrier and peak tubes were different and were established such that the peak tube was cut off when modulation was absent and the amplifier was producing rated unmodulated carrier power, and both tubes were conducting and each tube was contributing twice the rated carrier power during 100% modulation as four times the rated carrier power was required to achieve 100% modulation. As both tubes were operated in class C, a significant improvement in efficiency was thereby achieved in the final stage.\n\nIn addition, as the tetrode carrier and peak tubes required very little drive power, a significant improvement in efficiency within the driver was achieved as well. The commercial version of the Sainton amplifier employed a cathode-follower modulator, not the push-pull modulator disclosed in the patent, and the entire 50,000-watt transmitter was implemented using only nine total tubes of four tube types, all of these being general-purpose tubes, a remarkable achievement, given that the 317C's most significant competitor, RCA's BTA-50G, was implemented using thirty-two total tubes of nine tube types, nearly one-half of these being special-purpose, being employed only in the BTA-50G.\n\nNearly 300 CE 317C transmitters were installed in North America alone, easily outdistancing all competitors combined, until the development of successor high-power transistorized designs.\n\nNon-broadcast developments\nModern communication systems have seen sudden resurrection of Doherty amplifiers in 4G and pre-5G massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (mMIMO) based base-stations. The fact that modern communication systems use complex signal modulation schemes like OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) with high peak-to-peak average power ration (PAPR), the probability of amplifier operating at its peak power with its maximum efficiency is very low. The property to Doherty amplifier exhibiting multiple efficiency peaks at various lower power levels makes it an attractive option to boost the average efficiency of modern-day transmitters. The Doherty amplifier can accomplish by using a technique called \"Dynamic Load Modulation\" wherein the load seen by the main amplifier changes as a function of power level in-order to boost the efficiency at lower power levels.\n\nFootnotes\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n \u2212 US Patent\n \n\nElectronic amplifiers\nValve amplifiers", "machine_text": "Doherty amplifier is a type of power amplifier that is commonly used in communication systems. The Doherty amplifier was invented by William H. Doherty in 1936, and it has been used in radio and television transmitters for many decades. The Doherty amplifier is a hybrid architecture that consists of two amplifiers: a main amplifier (PA) and an auxiliary amplifier (AA). The main amplifier operates at a high power level, while the auxiliary amplifier operates at a lower power level. The two amplifiers work together to produce a high-efficiency, high-power output signal. The Doherty amplifier is known for its high efficiency, which means that it can produce a high-power output signal with a low power input. This makes it a popular choice for communication systems that require high power output with low power consumption. The Doherty amplifier has also been used in cellular and broadband communication systems, where it is used to amplify radio frequency signals. It is particularly useful in LTE (Long-Term Evolution) and WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) systems, where it is used to amplify the modulated signal before it is transmitted over the air. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the Doherty amplifier, as it offers a number of advantages over other types of power amplifiers. These include high efficiency, low distortion, and a wide frequency range. Overall, the Doherty amplifier remains an important technology for the communication industry. Its high efficiency and other advantages make it a popular choice for a wide range of applications, from radio and television broadcasting to cellular and broadband communication systems.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 23718712}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Cumulative inequality theory\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Cumulative inequality theory or Cumulative Disadvantage Theory is the systematic explanation of how inequalities develop. The theory was initially developed by Merton (1988), who studied the sciences and prestige. He believed that recognition from peers, and from published research in the scientific field created cumulative advantage (see Matthew affectMatthew effect)  that led to the receipt of resources that facilitated research projects. The theory expanded in four decades to include the idea that some people have more disadvantages than advantages which influence the quality of life of societies, cohorts, and individuals.  The theory is principally a social scientific explanation of phenomena but with links to biological and health factors, personal adjustment, and well-being.  A central premise is that \u201csocial systems generate inequality, which is manifested over the life course via demographic and developmental processes.\u201d\n\nDevelopment and application \n\nThe ideas of this theory were developed by Kenneth Ferraro and colleagues as an integrative or middle-range theory.  Originally specified in five axioms and nineteen propositions, cumulative inequality theory incorporates elements from the following theories and perspectives, several of which are related to the study of society:\nRobert Merton articulated the Matthew effect to explain accumulating advantage \nGlen Elder\u2019s life course perspective \nStress process theory \nAge stratification theory.\n\nIn recent years, Ferraro and several other researchers have been testing and elaborating elements of the theory on a variety of topics to provide evidence for the theoretical framework. In the following information you will find some of the uses of this theory in sociological studies.\n\nMcDonough, Worts, Booker, et al (2015) for example studied cumulative disadvantage in the generations of health inequality among mothers in Britain and the United States.  The study examined   \u201cif adverse circumstances early in the life course cumulate as health harming biographical patterns across working and family caregiving years.\u201d  Also, it was examined if institutional context moderated cumulative effects of micro level processes. The results showed that existing health disparities of women in midlife, during work and family rearing time, were intensified by cumulative disadvantages caused by adversities in early life. Thus, the accumulation of disadvantage had negative connotations for the well-being of women's occupational experiences and family life.\n\nMcLean (2010), on the other hand, studied U.S combat and non combat veterans through cumulative disadvantage. He discovered that cumulated negative disadvantages caused by disability and unemployment were more likely to influence the lives of combat veterans versus non combat veterans. Combat veterans suffered physical and emotional trauma that had a disabling effect which impeded their ability to successfully obtain employment. . The research is crucial for social policy implementation that assist United States Veterans to find and retain employment that is suitable to their personal conditions.\n\nIn continuation, Woolredge, Frank, Coulette, et al. ( 2016) studied the prison sentencing of racial groups. specifically of African American males with prior felony convictions. They examined how pre-trial processes affect trial outcomes. It was determined that cumulative disadvantage was existent for African American males and young men; the results were measured by: set bail amounts, pre-trial detention, prison sentencing, and no reduction in sentencing length. The research are striving to create changes in the justice system that reduce incarceration rates of African American Males by reducing bail amounts, and pre trial imprisonment. Further studies are important to decrease the incarceration of minority groups in society, and to create a non biased justice system.\n \nAdditionally, Ferraro & Moore (2003) have applied the theory to the study of long-term consequences of early obesity for midlife health and socioeconomic attainment. The study shows that obesity experienced in early life leads to lower-body disability, but higher risk factors to health. Moreover. The research mentions a risk that has been brought to attention in the past years; it ties being over weight to negative stigma (DeJong 1980),and has influenced fair labor market positioning and wages.\n\nLastly, Crystal, Shea, & Reyes (2016) studied the effects of cumulative advantage in increasing within age cohort economic inequalities in diverse periods of time. The study utilized economic patterns such as annual wealth value and household size. The inequalities of age were analyzed by using the gini coefficient.  The study took place between 1980 and 2010. The results showed that at age 65 plus individuals had higher rates of inequality and it increased significantly for baby boomers or during economic recession and times of war. The research is written to estimate the possible impacts of social security changes on older adults in American Society.\n\nIn conclusion, Cumulative Inequality or Cumulative Disadvantage Theory, is broadly examining various topics that impact public policy, and the view of our role within society. Further benefits of the theory are still to be seen in the next coming years.\n\nCore ideas \n\nAccording to Ferraro and Shippee, there are five main ideas in cumulative inequality or Cumulative Disadvantage Theory, which include:\n\n\u201cAxiom 1: Social systems generate inequality, which is manifested over the life course through demographic and developmental processes.\nAxiom 2:  Disadvantage increases exposure to risk, but advantage increases exposure to opportunity.\nAxiom 3: Life course trajectories are shaped by the accumulation of risk, available resources, and human agency.\nAxiom 4:  The perception of life trajectories influences subsequent trajectories\nAxiom 5:  Cumulative inequality may lead to premature mortality; therefore, nonrandom selection may give the appearance of decreasing inequality in later life.\u201d\n\nAxiom 1 \nFerraro, K.F., & Shippee, T.P. (2009) stated that social structures shape human behavior and interpersonal relations. Furthermore, cumulation in childhood experiences shape life outcomes sometimes in negative ways.  Inequality is, therefore,  not a randomly determined misfortune, but rather a predestined state that one is born into. Although it is possible for inequality to come from an individual's own actions consequences, that is not always true. One's childhood experiences and conditions should also be taken into consideration since these experiences help mold a young individual into an adult.\n\nAxiom 2 \nFerraro, K.F., & Shippee, T.P. (2009) want us to consider that cumulative advantage and disadvantage are not different they are merely opposite ends of the spectrum. Cumulative Disadvantage is perceived as a risk whereas Cumulative Advantage is an opportunity. \nA well-known concept in sociological sources is that individuals with advantages, whether they are achieved or born into, have a higher rate of opportunity in life. On the contrary, those with many disadvantages are more susceptible to risks throughout their life. For example, one who is born into the majority race with well-educated parents in a developed area will have more exposure to opportunity, whether it be getting a job through one of their parents' college friends or going to a highly rated high school and then being able to get into a highly accredited college. But, on the contrary, one who is born into a minority race with parents who may not have finished high school and live in the ghettos of the roughest town in the city may, not only have less exposure to opportunities, but more exposure to risks such as violence and crime.\n\nAxiom 3 \nFerraro, K.F., & Shippee, T.P. (2009) state that even though previous life events are important, the overall quality of life is determined by frequently changing trajectories, or the long-term changes in life stability, which are created by an individual's resources, risks, and human agencies. Human agencies simply refer to an individual's own ability to act and think on their own based on their own morals and beliefs. Elder & Shanahan (2006) however, believe that people's responses to stimuli determines changes to the trajectory of life. Moreover, the involvement of the institution in the decision-making process also alters individual decisions and behaviors.\n\nAxiom 4 \nCarstensen (2006) makes the inference that ones view on everyday situations and \nsuccess outcomes is more influential than their actual life status when it comes to their subsequent actions. Drawing from social comparison and symbolic interaction theories, a person's view of their resources may be different from what actually exists, and therefore shapes life trajectories in unique ways. People's view of their lives play a huge role into how they continue their trajectory through the decisions they make, and the activities they choose to partake in. Therefore, the theory makes the claim that those who possess a more positive and optimistic outlook on life typically are more satisfied with their life course.\n\nAxiom 5 \nFerraro, K.F., & Shippee, T.P. (2009) stated that before starting to explain Axiom 5, researchers should avoid cohort inversion. It will limit cohort centered studies, specifically, as it refers to the use of non random sample selection that excludes individuals with greater health issues from the samples. Studying individuals of certain age in this case, older adults, may lead to skewed data if selection of only healthier older adults takes place. The mean concentration of results will be designed to a specific population which will limit the data from being externally valid. The axiom may seem hard to understand at first but the overall meaning is that the accumulation of disadvantages can lead to premature mortality, or in simpler terms, younger death. Also, nonrandom selection may make it seem like mortality rates are decreasing when they are not. Take for example the number of young people deaths in areas with high crime and violence. These individuals are not exposed to many advancing opportunities so they fall victim of the cumulative inequality theory. The nonrandom selection component of the axiom signifies how older populations age in a manner that is not totally random, but rather as a result of the advantages and disadvantages that they have gathered throughout their life. An example is exceptional health care throughout life which prolonged lifespan, or, on the contrary, prolonged exposure to toxic chemicals as a result of working in dangerous environments.\n\nSources\n\nFurther reading\n\nSocial theories", "machine_text": "Cumulative inequality theory, also known as cumulative disadvantage theory, is a sociological concept that explains how social inequality increases throughout an individual's life due to factors such as race, gender, and socioeconomic status. The theory suggests that individuals who are born into disadvantaged situations, such as poverty or discrimination, face barriers that limit their opportunities and resources. These limitations, in turn, further exacerbate their disadvantage throughout their lifetime. This creates a cumulative effect where inequality builds up over time and becomes more pronounced as individuals progress through life. The idea of cumulative inequality was first introduced by social scientists in the 1960s and 1970s who observed that certain groups in society, such as women and minorities, faced significant discrimination and disadvantage compared to others. These researchers studied the ways in which inequality was passed down from generation to generation and how it affected individuals\u2019 life outcomes. The theory of cumulative inequality emphasizes the importance of social institutions, such as schools and workplaces, in perpetuating or mitigating inequalities. For example, schools that provide high-quality education and offer resources such as tutoring and counseling can help to narrow the opportunity gap between disadvantaged students and their peers. Similarly, employers who value diversity and provide equal pay and advancement opportunities can help to reduce cumulative inequality in the workplace. In recent years, critics of the theory have argued that it oversimplifies the complex realities of social inequality and fails to account for individual agency and choice in shaping life outcomes. However, proponents argue that the theory remains a relevant and useful framework for understanding the ways in which social inequality is perpetuated and compounded over time.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 42044690}

Each location features three different primary days with five different hunts available from the start of the region. The game features a big variety of environments available including lush forests, dry deserts, craggy mountains, flooded plains, scorching savannas and the freezing tundra. The game also features multiple scenarios where \"decisions\" will have to be made. Each region features a variety of animals each specific to the environments in which can be hunted throughout the game.\n\nThe game incorporates many new and returning elements not found in previous main series games, such as having shooting blinds, shooting rests and tree stands, a caller, and other things to aid the player. \"Hunter Sense\" returns, and now upon finding evidence, the player creates a flashback in the form of a black-and-white moving image of the animal's last known location and what that animal was doing. But other new things are implemented in this game to work against the player, such as animals now having some of the most improved and most realistic AI in any game, meaning they could easily see, smell, or hear you if you make a wrong move. Similar to Dangerous Hunts, predators can now randomly surprise the player by jumping out of a bush or off a cliff, so the player's \"killer instinct\" slow-motion mode activates, turning the player towards the animal to shoot before it lands a hit. Getting to your target is now more challenging with the implementation of stealth hunts and timed hunts. Stealth hunts are when the males are not within reach and the player must use stealth and cover (usually thick bushes, logs, and rock formations) to avoid females, noisy terrain, and other animals like birds. The player is also given a device called a UTD that measures your presence to the animals. A low-pitched beep means that the animals are calm and can't detect you, medium-pitched beeps indicate that animals are starting to detect your presence, and high-pitched beeps tell the player that animals have clearly spotted the player and they are about to run away. A timed hunt is activated either when you reach your target, a predator or another force that could disturb the animals appears and the player must kill the target in a certain amount of time; or when the animals appear as a large herd and the player must kill a certain number of males before time runs out. Many birds and small mammals roam around for the player to shoot at their leisure. Sometimes the player can reach a hidden area, where they have an opportunity to photograph rare animals and natural behaviors. There's also a gun store where players can buy, customize, and upgrade their weapons.\n\nThe game also features multiplayer where players can create or customize their own map from a template (based on campaign or gallery) or from scratch. Players can place trees, foliage, water, terrain formations, and animals found in the game or create custom animals, which they can hunt with friends with online connectivity. Players can set challenges to compete in hunting the rarest animals and like Campaign mode, players can also buy and customize their weapons for each type of situation (a typical weapon is usually a variation of a scoped bolt-action hunting rifle). There are multiple shooting galleries like arcade, where you can kill as many animals as want, target, which you can use to practice your marksmanship by shooting wood cutouts of animal targets, or reflex which tests your hunting skills by instructing the player to kill certain animals in a chronological order. The game was released packaged with the Top Shot Elite, a plastic peripheral for the Wii controller.\n\nStory\nTwenty-five-year-old John Sharp, a rookie big game hunter, is invited to participate in the Cabela's 2012 International Safari hosted by John Hathcock, a high-ranking member of the Order of Orion, an elite club of world-class big game hunters from all over the world. The player starts in Montana, Sharp's homeland, where he hunts red deer, white-tailed deer, pronghorn, and hunt an elk before wolves scare it away. The next day a wounded mountain lion terrorizes the area, and Sharp must kill it. The player heads to Mexico, where he hunts whitetail, bighorn sheep, pronghorn, and mule deer. After taking shelter in an arroyo during a sandstorm, Sharp finds boot tracks, confident that someone trespassed into his zone. Just as he's approaching a bison herd, a rifle fires and misses, scaring them off. It's revealed Matisse fired, trying to make Sharp miss his chance. The two argue, but Hathcock shames them.\n\nThen the player goes to Hathcock's private ranch in Texas, hunting white-tailed deer, mule deer, elk, wild boar, bison, and moose. The radio gets a distress call from Freidkin, with Hathcock telling Sharp to check it out. Sharp finds that Freidkin's stand was knocked over by a startled bison, making him fall 70 feet down into a gorge. Sharp must then defend him from meat-craving boars until medical assistance arrives. Freidkin is taken to a hospital, where his left leg is amputated, making him drop out. The player goes to Namibia, where he hunts blackbuck, impala, zebra, wildebeest, greater kudu, White rhino and Cape buffalo. Sharp comes across lion tracks, confirming that a hunting pride is scouring the area. Sharp hears as Cassidy alerts everyone that he and his kill are surrounded by lions. As Cassidy starts to panic, Sharp instructs him to abandon his trophy and jump into a nearby ravine. There are several roars and a scream as several birds are flushed from the trees. Sharp runs to the site, finding nothing but Cassidy's rifle and pack with smears of blood. Sharp sees the male lion in the distance, and must dispatch the lionesses. He's then ambushed by the lion, and as he's about to kill Sharp a shot fires, and the lion pauses and falls to his side. Sharp sits up and sees Matisse, revealing he shot the lion for himself, saving his life. Authorities scour the area, but Cassidy's body is never found.\n\nThe player and Matisse finally go to Kodiak Island in Alaska, the final location as an approaching Arctic blizzard threatens the cancel the tournament. Meanwhile, a man-eating grizzly bear named Bloody Ben has been terrorizing the island for the last decade, and poses a huge threat to the hunters, spectators, and game animals in the area. The player hunts red deer, Sitka deer, elk, Dall sheep, caribou, and moose. In the midst of the blizzard, Sharp finally finds Ben's tracks, and just as he's about to shoot, a man jumps in front of his scope, revealed to be Matisse. He aggravates the bear by shooting twice, but is mauled. Sharp runs to Matisse, badly injured and passed out. Sharp is then startled by the bear, and jumps to the ground for his rifle as Bloody Ben closes in for the kill. Sharp kills Ben after shooting him 6 times in his vitals. Matisse wakes up, only to see Sharp looking at him with a confident smirk and Bloody Ben dead behind him. Matisse admits defeat to Sharp and apologizes for everything he's done. Sharp then sells Ben's skin to the Order, and he uses the money to go to Hawaii the next summer.

The baby is healthy and Jax and Tara hear the heartbeat and see the baby on the ultrasound. Jax and Tara then go to Gemma's house where Gemma hugs her. Tara sees Abel and happily holds him and welcomes him back home. In the season finale, Tara has become more involved with the club. She drives Jimmy O back to the garage in the trunk after SAMCRO buys him from the Russians. Jax makes sure that she wears a bulletproof vest to ensure her safety in case something goes wrong. When Stahl tells the club about the deal Jax made with her, which was actually a trap by the club to kill Stahl and Jimmy, she runs and hugs him distraught and fearing that the club will kill him in prison. With the help of Unser, Chibs Telford kills Jimmy O'Phelan in retribution for stealing his wife and daughter many years ago, before Opie forces a terrified Stahl in the front seat of the cop car. During this confrontation Stahl breaks down crying and begs Opie for her life, to which Opie responds, \"This is what she felt.\" He then shoots Stahl in the back of the head with a MAC-10, instantly killing her, to avenge the death of his wife Donna. After this, Chibs rigs the scene to look as if the real IRA murdered Stahl and Jimmy. Tara reads letters from John Teller to his mistress Maureen Ashby, implying that Gemma and Clay would be responsible for his death should it happen. The rest of SAMCRO, enroute to prison, celebrate their victory over Jimmy and Stahl.\n\nReception\nIGN voted Agent Stahl's death #10 in their list of the biggest deaths, They said: \"The ending of Season 3 was one of the more gratifying twists the show ever had. Things seemed bleak when Agent Stahl informed the club that Jax had made a deal and ratted them out. But what she didn\u2019t know was that it was all a setup, one that ended with her dead as Opie got his revenge for her setting him up and getting his wife killed. The season ended on an unexpectedly up note as Clay and Jax smiled and the rest of the guys in the prison van shared a laugh. Sure they were on their way to prison, but Jax wasn\u2019t a rat and Stahl was out of the picture for good.\"\n\nZach Handler of The A.V. Club gave \"NS\" an A- rating, stating; \"What worked the best about 'NS' and what allows me to be optimistic about next season's potential, even while having largely mixed feelings on this season overall, is the ending. The episode doesn't manage to make all the IRA stuff feel organic, and Hal Holbrook doesn't pop back in to remind us about that basically innocent housekeeper that got murdered a while back, but it does introduce a new threat to the Sons, and, unlike Cameron and his Disappearing Baby Trick, this threat fits in beautifully with the context of the show overall. Maureen smuggled John's letters to her in Jax's backpack, and Tara found them. Reading them, while Jax and Clay grin at each other in triumph and while Gemma sits with her grandson in her arms, propped up like a queen on her throne, we hear Teller's voice-over again. It's long been hinted at that Clay and Gemma had something to do with John's death. This is a Hamlet riff, after all. And now Tara, the outsider who finally found her way to belonging, has reason to be suspicious. Makes you wonder what else is in those letters. And it makes you wonder what Jax'll do if he reads them.\"\n\nReferences\n\n2010 American television episodes\nSons of Anarchy episodes", "machine_text": "NS is a fictional outlaw motorcycle club featured in the popular American television series, Sons of Anarchy. The club is headquartered in northern California and is depicted as one of the largest and most powerful outlaw motorcycle gangs in the series. NS is introduced in the second season of Sons of Anarchy as a rival club to the Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club, Redwood Original (SAMCRO). The two clubs engage in a heated and violent conflict throughout the season, with NS being portrayed as a particularly dangerous and ruthless organization. The club is led by Ethan Zobelle, a businessman who uses his wealth and influence to further the club's criminal activities. NS is primarily involved in the distribution of white supremacist literature and the trafficking of illegal drugs. In addition to Zobelle, NS is comprised of a number of other key members, including his enforcer A.J. Weston and his wife Polly. The club also maintains ties with other white supremacist organizations, such as the League of American Nationalists. Despite their formidable reputation, NS ultimately proves to be no match for SAMCRO. Zobelle is killed by Jax Teller, the protagonist of Sons of Anarchy, and the remaining members of NS are either arrested or driven out of town. NS is notable for its portrayal of white supremacist ideology and the violent tactics used by outlaw motorcycle clubs. The depiction of the club and its activities has been controversial, with some critics accusing the series of glamorizing and even promoting the lifestyle of outlaw bikers. Overall, NS is a significant element of the Sons of Anarchy universe, serving as a powerful antagonist to the heroic SAMCRO members. The club's depiction highlights the dangerous and often violent world of outlaw motorcycle gangs and the complex moral challenges faced by those who inhabit it.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 59224166}

The Cornwall and Lebanon Railroad earlier had established a station and picnic ground at Mount Gretna.\n\nHistory \nThe Gilded Age iron industrialist and railroad president Robert Habersham Coleman decided that a  narrow-gauge railroad to the top of nearby Governor Dick Mountain would provide an additional tourist draw, and a  spur at milepost 0.75 could service the Pennsylvania National Guard rifle ranges nearby. The line was built to the rare (in North America) and very narrow gauge of .  Locomotives, apart from an early and unsuccessful H. K. Porter, Inc  Forney locomotive, were three  \"American\" types (#11, #12 and #15) built by Baldwin Locomotive Works.  Locomotive #12 was ordered on 22 June 1889 and built in only 8 days to be ready for anticipated Independence Day crowds after the Porter Forney wheelbase proved too rigid for reliable service on small-radius curves. The Baldwin locomotives featured lagged smokeboxes and were the only  gauge s ever operated in North America; although Baldwin built a  gauge  for the Ferrocarril de Tacubaya of Mexico City in 1897.\n\nRails weighing  were spiked onto the  face of ties   long.  A turntable, engine-house, water tank, runaround track, and storage tracks were near the junction with the Cornwall & Lebanon at Mount Gretna.  Return loops were built near the rifle range and around Governor Dick peak.  During the summer of 1889 passengers were carried in one conventional coach and 7 open-sided observation cars boarded from long foot-boards running along the length of either side of the car. These eight passenger cars were built by the Jackson & Sharp Company. Two more observation cars were added when locomotive #15 was purchased for the summer of 1890. At first the railroad was popular, but the tourist trade declined after the novelty had died down.  The loop around Governor Dick was dismantled after the summer of 1896, but the railroad continued operation for the National Guard rifle range.  A serious accident in 1915 killed off that traffic.  One of the observation cars overturned on a sharp curve when a large number of guardsmen attempted to board simultaneously from one side of the car. There were some serious injuries, and the tiny railroad ceased operation in the summer of 1916, shortly after its parent company's purchase by the Pennsylvania Railroad.  The narrow-gauge equipment was loaded aboard standard gauge cars on 14 September 1916.\n\nLocomotives\n\nCornwall and Lebanon Railroad \nThe standard-gauge Cornwall and Lebanon Railroad continued operations as a branch of the Pennsylvania Railroad, and later Penn Central Transportation Company until 1972. Hurricane Agnes caused flood damage, preventing operation of trains on the branch, and the damage was not repaired. The branch was converted to the 21st-century Lebanon Valley Rail Trail after the rails were removed.\n\nReferences\n\nNotes\n\n2 ft gauge railways in the United States\nNarrow gauge railroads in Pennsylvania\nRailway lines closed in 1916\nDefunct Pennsylvania railroads", "machine_text": "Mount Gretna Narrow Gauge Railway The Mount Gretna Narrow Gauge Railway is a historic narrow gauge railway located in Lebanon County, Pennsylvania. It was built in the late 19th century in order to transport lumber and slate from the small town of Mount Gretna to the surrounding areas. The railway was constantly used until the 1930s, when it was abandoned and its tracks were removed. The railway was constructed in 1878 and was initially used to transport lumber and other materials to the towns surrounding Mount Gretna. It was a 2-foot gauge railway, which means that the distance between the rails was only 2 feet. The locomotives used on the railway were small and nimble, and were able to navigate the steep grades and narrow curves of the railway. In the early 20th century, the railway began to transport slate from local quarries as well. The slate was used for roofing and other construction purposes. The railway became an important part of the local economy, and provided jobs for many people in the area. However, with the advent of automobiles and trucks, the railway became less important. By the 1930s, the railway was no longer profitable, and it was abandoned. The tracks were removed and the locomotives were sold or scrapped. In the 1970s, a group of local enthusiasts began to restore the railway. They rebuilt the tracks, and acquired several small locomotives and cars. Today, the Mount Gretna Narrow Gauge Railway operates as a tourist attraction, giving visitors a glimpse into the past and allowing them to experience the joys of a ride on a historic narrow gauge railway. The railway is open to the public from May through October, and offers rides on weekends and holidays. The rides cover a distance of approximately 1.5 miles, and provide visitors with beautiful views of the surrounding mountains and forests. The railway is staffed by volunteers, who are passionate about preserving the history of the railway and sharing it with others. In conclusion, the Mount Gretna Narrow Gauge Railway is a unique and historic railway that played an important role in the local economy of Lebanon County, Pennsylvania. Today, it stands as a testament to the ingenuity and determination of its builders, and as a reminder of the importance of preserving our history for future generations.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1199057}

The helmet would mainly see use by the Nationalists in the conflict.\n\nDesign \n\nWhile being of similar shape to the M26 helmet, the M34 has many unique design features to distinguish itself. The shell is made of inferior material, only having  thick steel and being lighter in overall weight to the M26, giving it worse ballistic and crash characteristics to the M26. The shell generally being painted in a sand color or light brown, with surviving examples being refurbished in the 1943 order with green paint and a frontal bracket. The liner is quite different from its army cousin, instead of being attached by seven rivets around the sides of the shell, the liner is affixed using sheet metal wire from the circumference band holding the pads to the very top of the shell by means of a single rivet. The liner features four smaller leather pads as opposed to the three on the M26. Behind said pads are four paltry sized felt pads to give cushioning between the pad and liner band.

The M1934 helmet was designed to protect soldiers from shrapnel and bullets. It was made of 1.4mm thick steel and had a distinctive shape with a high crown and a flared rim that covered the ears. The helmet weighed about 1.2kg and had a leather chin strap that was secured by two buttons on either side of the helmet. The helmet's design is reminiscent of other European helmets used during that period. It was based on the French Adrian helmet which was widely used during World War I. Despite being a copy of the Adrian helmet, it had several unique features that set it apart from the original design. The M1934 helmet had a more angular and elongated shape, a higher crown, and a flared rim for extra protection. It also used a simpler liner than the Adrian helmet.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Disruptive selection\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Disruptive selection, also called diversifying selection, describes changes in population genetics in which extreme values for a trait are favored over intermediate values. In this case, the variance of the trait increases and the population is divided into two distinct groups. In this more individuals acquire peripheral character value at both ends of the distribution curve.\n\nOverview \nNatural selection is known to be one of the most important biological processes behind evolution. There are many variations of traits, and some cause greater or lesser reproductive success of the individual. The effect of selection is to promote certain alleles, traits, and individuals that have a higher chance to survive and reproduce in their specific environment. Since the environment has a carrying capacity, nature acts on this mode of selection on individuals to let only the most fit offspring survive and reproduce to their full potential. The more advantageous the trait is the more common it will become in the population. Disruptive selection is a specific type of natural selection that actively selects against the intermediate in a population, favoring both extremes of the spectrum.\n\nDisruptive selection is inferred to oftentimes lead to sympatric speciation through a phyletic gradualism mode of evolution. Disruptive selection can be caused or influenced by multiple factors and also have multiple outcomes, in addition to speciation. Individuals within the same environment can develop a preference for extremes of a trait, against the intermediate. Selection can act on having divergent body morphologies in accessing food, such as beak and dental structure. It is seen that often this is more prevalent in environments where there is not a wide clinal range of resources, causing heterozygote disadvantage or selection against the average.\n\nNiche partitioning allows for selection of differential patterns of resource usage, which can drive speciation. To the contrast, niche conservation pulls individuals toward ancestral ecological traits in an evolutionary tug-of-war. Also, nature tends to have a 'jump on the band wagon' perspective when something beneficial is found. This can lead to the opposite occurring with disruptive selection eventually selecting against the average; when everyone starts taking advantage of that resource it will become depleted and the extremes will be favored. Furthermore, gradualism is a more realistic view when looking at speciation as compared to punctuated equilibrium.\n\nDisruptive selection can initially rapidly intensify divergence; this is because it is only manipulating alleles that already exist. Often it is not creating new ones by mutation which takes a long time. Usually complete reproductive isolation does not occur until many generations, but behavioral or morphological differences separate the species from reproducing generally. Furthermore, generally hybrids have reduced fitness which promotes reproductive isolation.\n\nExample \nSuppose there is a population of rabbits.  The color of the rabbits is governed by two incompletely dominant traits: black fur, represented by \"B\", and white fur, represented by \"b\". A rabbit in this population with a genotype of \"BB\" would have a phenotype of black fur, a genotype of \"Bb\" would have grey fur (a display of both black and white), and a genotype of \"bb\" would have white fur.\n\nIf this population of rabbits occurred in an environment that had areas of black rocks as well as areas of white rocks, the rabbits with black fur would be able to hide from predators amongst the black rocks, and the rabbits with white fur likewise amongst the white rocks.  The rabbits with grey fur, however, would stand out in all areas of the habitat, and would thereby suffer greater predation.\n\nAs a consequence of this type of selective pressure, our hypothetical rabbit population would be disruptively selected for extreme values of the fur color trait: white or black, but not grey. This is an example of underdominance (heterozygote disadvantage) leading to disruptive selection.\n\nSympatric speciation\nIt is believed that disruptive selection is one of the main forces that drive sympatric speciation in natural populations. The pathways that lead from disruptive selection to sympatric speciation seldom are prone to deviation; such speciation is a domino effect that depends on the consistency of each distinct variable. These pathways are the result of disruptive selection in intraspecific competition; it may cause reproductive isolation, and finally culminate in sympatric speciation.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that disruptive selection does not always have to be based on intraspecific competition. It is also important to know that this type of natural selection is similar to the other ones. Where it is not the major factor, intraspecific competition can be discounted in assessing the operative aspects of the course of adaptation. For example, what may drive disruptive selection instead of intraspecific competition might be polymorphisms that lead to reproductive isolation, and thence to speciation.\n\nWhen disruptive selection is based on intraspecific competition, the resulting selection in turn promotes ecological niche diversification and polymorphisms.  If multiple morphs (phenotypic forms) occupy different niches, such separation could be expected to promote reduced competition for resources. Disruptive selection is seen more often in high density populations rather than in low density populations because intraspecific competition tends to be more intense within higher density populations.  This is because higher density populations often imply more competition for resources. The resulting competition drives polymorphisms to exploit different niches or changes in niches in order to avoid competition. If one morph has no need for resources used by another morph, then it is likely that neither would experience pressure to compete or interact, thereby supporting the persistence and possibly the intensification of the distinctness of the two morphs within the population. This theory does not necessarily have a lot of supporting evidence in natural populations, but it has been seen many times in experimental situations using existing populations. These experiments further support that, under the right situations (as described above), this theory could prove to be true in nature.\n\nWhen intraspecific competition is not at work disruptive selection can still lead to sympatric speciation and it does this through maintaining polymorphisms. Once the polymorphisms are maintained in the population, if assortative mating is taking place, then this is one way that disruptive selection can lead in the direction of sympatric speciation. If different morphs have different mating preferences then assortative mating can occur, especially if the polymorphic trait is a \"magic trait\", meaning a trait that is under ecological selection and in turn has a side effect on reproductive behavior. In a situation where the polymorphic trait is not a magic trait then there has to be some kind of fitness penalty for those individuals who do not mate assortatively and a mechanism that causes assortative mating has to evolve in the population. For example, if a species of butterflies develops two kinds of wing patterns, crucial to mimicry purposes in their preferred habitat, then mating between two butterflies of different wing patterns leads to an unfavorable heterozygote. Therefore, butterflies will tend to mate with others of the same wing pattern promoting increased fitness, eventually eliminating the heterozygote altogether. This unfavorable heterozygote generates pressure for a mechanism that cause assortative mating which will then lead to reproductive isolation due to the production of post-mating barriers. It is actually fairly common to see sympatric speciation when disruptive selection is supporting two morphs, specifically when the phenotypic trait affects fitness rather than mate choice.\n\nIn both situations, one where intraspecific competition is at work and the other where it is not, if all these factors are in place, they will lead to reproductive isolation, which can lead to sympatric speciation.\n\nOther outcomes\n polymorphism\n sexual dimorphism\n phenotypic plasticity\n\nSignificance \n\nDisruptive selection is of particular significance in the history of evolutionary study, as it is involved in one of evolution's \"cardinal cases\", namely the finch populations observed by Darwin in the Gal\u00e1pagos.\nHe observed that the species of finches were similar enough to ostensibly have been descended from a single species.  However, they exhibited disruptive variation in beak size.  This variation appeared to be adaptively related to the seed size available on the respective islands (big beaks for big seeds, small beaks for small seeds).  Medium beaks had difficulty retrieving small seeds and were also not tough enough for the bigger seeds, and were hence maladaptive.\n\nWhile it is true that disruptive selection can lead to speciation, this is not as quick or straightforward of a process as other types of speciation or evolutionary change. This introduces the topic of gradualism, which is a slow but continuous accumulation of changes over long periods of time. This is largely because the results of disruptive selection are less stable than the results of directional selection (directional selection favors individuals at only one end of the spectrum).\n\nFor example, let us take the mathematically straightforward yet biologically improbable case of the rabbits:  Suppose directional selection were taking place. The field only has dark rocks in it, so the darker the rabbit, the more effectively it can hide from predators. Eventually there will be a lot of black rabbits in the population (hence many \"B\" alleles) and a lesser amount of grey rabbits (who contribute 50% chromosomes with \"B\" allele and 50% chromosomes with \"b\" allele to the population). There will be few white rabbits (not very many contributors of chromosomes with \"b\" allele to the population). This could eventually lead to a situation in which chromosomes with \"b\" allele die out, making black the only possible color for all subsequent rabbits.  The reason for this is that there is nothing \"boosting\" the level of \"b\" chromosomes in the population. They can only go down, and eventually die out.\n\nConsider now the case of disruptive selection. The result is equal numbers of black and white rabbits, and hence equal numbers of chromosomes with \"B\" or \"b\" allele, still floating around in that population. Every time a white rabbit mates with a black one, only gray rabbits results. So, in order for the results to \"click\", there needs to be a force causing white rabbits to choose other white rabbits, and black rabbits to choose other black ones. In the case of the finches, this \"force\" was geographic/niche isolation. This leads one to think that disruptive selection can't happen and is normally because of species being geographically isolated, directional selection or by stabilising selection.\n\nSee also\n\n Character displacement\n Balancing selection\n Directional selection\n Negative selection (natural selection)\n Stabilizing selection\n Sympatric speciation\n Fluctuating selection\n Selection\n\nReferences\n\nSelection", "machine_text": "Disruptive selection, also known as diversifying selection, is a type of natural selection that occurs when individuals with extreme traits in a given population have a higher fitness than individuals with average traits. This leads to the splitting of a population into two or more distinct groups, each with their own set of traits. Disruptive selection can occur when there is a bimodal distribution of a certain trait and environmental conditions favor both extremes of the trait. For example, if a population of birds has either large or small beaks and the available food sources require either a large or small beak to efficiently obtain it, then birds with an average sized beak would have a lower fitness than those with the extreme beak sizes. This would lead to the population splitting into two groups, each with their own specialized beak size. Disruptive selection is often associated with the evolution of new species, as the two or more groups that result from the selection become reproductively isolated from one another, leading to speciation. In addition, disruptive selection can lead to an increase in genetic diversity within a population, as the individuals with extreme traits are more likely to mate with one another, leading to the introduction of new genetic combinations. However, disruptive selection can also have negative consequences for populations, as the individuals with average traits may become less fit and ultimately die out. This can decrease the genetic diversity of the population, making it more vulnerable to environmental changes or disease. Disruptive selection has been observed in numerous species, including birds, insects, and plants. It is an important factor in the process of evolution and can lead to the development of new and unique traits within a population.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1275975}

The museum was established in 1846, by the Royal Society of Tasmania, the oldest Royal Society outside England. \nThe TMAG receives 400,000 visitors annually.\n\nHistory\nThe museum was officially created in 1848, though the collections it housed were much created earlier. It merged a number of disparate collections, including that of the Royal Society of Tasmania. The Mechanics' Institution of Hobart, Van Diemen's Land Agricultural Society and Van Diemen's Land Scientific Society had each attempted to found a museum earlier than this date, the most successful of these being the Mechanics' Institution, but little record remains of what happened to these efforts.\n\nSir John Eardley-Wilmot, 1st Baronet, during his period was Lt. Governor of Tasmania, did much of the work that led to the modern museum. The museum was noted as first being an established institution in the 1848 minutes of the Royal Society of Tasmania, though Wilmot had done most of the work in 1843 and had attempted to set up a museum in the cottage of the Secretary of the Governor, in what is now the Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens. In 1838 the Mechanics' Institution received an agreement from the government for a room to be constructed in the Customs House for use as a museum. Customs House was later requisitioned by the Legislative Council of Tasmania and became Parliament House, Hobart. The Royal Society of Tasmania later founded TMAG in the sub-committee room of the Parliament, possibly the same room.\n \nThe museum moved to Harrington St in 1852, where it paid \u00a360 a year in rent for a hall there. In 1853 the governor placed before the Legislative Council a debate on the state granting a plot of land for the building of a permanent museum building. In 1854 the museum attracted over 1000 visitors in a year for the first time. In 1855 the Lady Franklin Museum, founded in 1842 at Acanthe Park (now Lenah Valley), sold its fittings and collection to the Royal Society and these were added to the TMAG. The acquisition was driven by the donation of a large geology collection by Joseph Milligan.\n\nIn 1861 after a number of years, funding was acquired from the state government to construct a museum and the Royal Society hosted an architectural contest. Henry Hunter won and was awarded the contract to design a permanent building for the museum. Henry Young, Governor of Tasmania, laid the cornerstone in that year. The Museum was completed by 1862 and a celebratory art exhibition was hosted by Morton Allport, Henry Hunter and a Captain F. E. Chesney. The art exhibition's objective was to raise money for internal fittings of the building, as the money allocated by the state had only covered construction of the building. In 1884 Alexander Morton, previously Assistant Curator of the Australian Museum, was appointed curator.\n\nIn 1885 the museum was passed from the Royal Society of Tasmania to the a board of trustees under the state government, with a yearly endowment of \u00a3500. Until this point it was officially named The Royal Society's Museum. The Royal Society granted the Royal Botanical Gardens, Hobart to the state government at the same time, and they became known as the Tasmanian Museum and Botanical Gardens in that year. Adye Douglas, Premier of Tasmania, was elected Chair of the Board and Alexander Morton was reelected curator and secretary with an annual salary of \u00a3200.\n\nIn 1889 a new wing was opened by R Hamilton to extend the museum. In 1890 Betsey Island, then Franklin Island, was granted to the Trustees of the Museum.\n\nIn 1952 the boards of the Botanical Gardens and the Museum were split and the museum assumed its modern name. An act of Parliament was passed to make this so.\n\nGovernance\nIn 1885, TMAG became a Government authority under the control of a Board of Trustees that also controlled the Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens. By statute, it is now controlled by a Board of Trustees, and is currently part of the Department of State Growth.\n\nAssociated bodies\nTMAG has a number of associated bodies. The Foundation of the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery serves as the primary fundraising body for the TMAG. The Friends of the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery works to encourage community engagement with the museum, along with its youth-focused counterpart TMAGgots. The Royal Society of Tasmania founded the museum, donating much of its collection, and continues to loan a significant number of pieces.\n\nOther facilities\nIn addition to the main campus, TMAG includes three external sites: a herbarium, a storage and research facility, and the Moonah Workshop.\n\nState collection\nThe museum and art gallery reopened to the public on 15 March 2013, after a four-month closure for redevelopment works.\n\nSee also\n List of museums in Tasmania\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nTasmanian Museum and Art Gallery Twitter stream\nTasmanian Museum and Art Gallery YouTube channel\nFlora of Tasmania Online\nTMAGgots website\n\nLandmarks in Hobart\nMuseums in Hobart\n1843 establishments in Australia\nNatural history museums in Australia\nCulture in Hobart\nArt museums and galleries in Australia\nNumismatic museums in Australia\nGovernment agencies of Tasmania\nTasmanian Heritage Register", "machine_text": "Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery The Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery (TMAG) is a museum located in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia.

Foster signed a contract with Columbia Pictures in 1926 and went on to play leading roles in several films produced by the studio. One of her most famous roles was in the 1927 film \"The Patent Leather Kid\", opposite Richard Barthelmess. The film was a huge hit and helped boost Foster's career. In the early 1930s, Foster transitioned to sound films and continued to receive critical acclaim. She starred in several dramas and Westerns, including \"The Taming of the West\" and \"The Lost Special\". However, her career began to slow down in the mid-1930s due to personal issues and a lack of roles. Foster's last film appearance was in the 1936 film \"6 Day Bike Rider\". She retired from acting after this and devoted her time to raising her son and pursuing other interests. Helen Foster was known for her talent and charm both on and off-screen. She was also a strong advocate for animal rights and was heavily involved in charitable organizations dedicated to the cause. Foster passed away on December 25, 1982, in Beverly Hills, California, at the age of 80.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Bothy\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "A bothy is a basic shelter, usually left unlocked and available for anyone to use free of charge. It was also a term for basic accommodation, usually for gardeners or other workers on an estate. Bothies are found in remote mountainous areas of Scotland, Northern England, Ulster and Wales. They are particularly common in the Scottish Highlands, but related buildings can be found around the world (for example, in the Nordic countries there are wilderness huts). A bothy was also a semi-legal drinking den in the Isle of Lewis. These, such as Bothan E\u00f2rapaidh, were used until recent years as gathering points for local men and were often situated in an old hut or caravan.\n\nEtymology\n\nThe etymology of the word bothy is uncertain. Suggestions include a relation to both \"hut\" as in Irish both\u00e1n and Scottish Gaelic bothan or bothag; a corruption of the Welsh term bwthyn, also meaning small cottage; and a derivation from Norse b\u016b\u00f0, cognate with English booth with a diminutive ending.\n\nCharacter\n\nMost bothies are ruined buildings which have been restored to a basic standard, providing a windproof and watertight shelter. They vary in size from little more than a large box up to two-storey cottages. They usually have designated sleeping areas, which commonly are either an upstairs room or a raised platform, thus allowing one to keep clear of cold air and draughts at floor height. No bedding, mattresses or blankets are provided. Public access to bothies is either on foot, by bicycle or boat. Most have a fireplace and are near a natural source of water. A spade may be provided to bury waste.\n\nThere are thousands of examples to draw from. A typical Scottish bothy is the Salmon Fisherman's Bothy, Newtonhill, which is perched above the Burn of Elsick near its mouth at the North Sea. Another Scottish example from the peak of the salmon fishing in the 1890s is the fisherman's bothy at the mouth of the Burn of Muchalls. A further example is the Lairig Leacach Bothy in Lochaber, not far to the east of Fort William.\n\nBothy code\n\nBecause they are freely available to all, the continued existence of bothies relies on users helping look after them.\nOver the years, the Mountain Bothies Association has developed a Bothy Code that sets out the main points users should respect:\n\n Bothies are used entirely at users' own risk.\n Leave the bothy clean and tidy with dry kindling for the next visitors. Make other visitors welcome. \n Report any damage to whomever maintains the bothy. Take out all rubbish which you cannot burn. Avoid burying rubbish; this pollutes the environment. Do not leave perishable food as this attracts vermin. Guard against fire risk and ensure the fire is out before you leave. Make sure the doors and windows are properly closed when you leave.\n If there is no toilet at the bothy bury human waste out of sight and well away from the water supply; never use the vicinity of the bothy as a toilet.\n Never cut live wood or damage estate property. Use fuel sparingly.\n Large groups and long stays are to be discouraged \u2013 bothies are intended for small groups on the move in the mountains.\n Respect any restrictions on use of the bothy, for example during stag stalking or at lambing time. Please remember bothies are available for short stays only. The owner's permission must be obtained if you intend an extended stay.\n Because of overcrowding and lack of facilities, large groups (6 or more) should not use a bothy nor camp near a bothy without first seeking permission from the owner. Bothies are not available for commercial groups.\n\nOwnership\n\nBothies are usually owned by the landowner of the estate on which they stand, although the actual owner is rarely involved in any way, other than by permitting their continued existence, and by helping with transport of materials. Many are maintained by volunteers from the Mountain Bothies Association (MBA), a charity that looks after 97 bothies in Scotland, the north of England, and Wales.\n\nThe location of these bothies can be found on the Mountain Bothies Association (MBA) website, along with information on how people can help.\n\nIn popular culture\n\nThe song Am Bothan a Bh'Aig Fionnghuala (\"Fionghuala's Bothy\") is a traditional song recorded by the Bothy Band in\n1976.\n\nBothy Culture is the second studio album by Scottish Celtic fusion artist Martyn Bennett. It was released in 1998.\n\nMarion Zimmer Bradley used bothies as a pattern for shelters at Hellers mountains in her Darkover novels.\n\nThe narrator's bothy is the setting for much of the action in the 1996 suspense novel To the Hilt by Dick Francis.\n\nA bothy is featured in the 2013 film Under the Skin.\n\nA bothy is featured in the 2012 video game Dear Esther, providing a crucial plot moment in the narration of the unknown main character.\n\nThe Key-Stone of the Bridge, a novel and audiobook by Craig Meggy, is part homage to Robert Burns, set in Ben Alder Bothy.\n\nThe Scottish history podcast Stories of Scotland examines bothy culture, heritage and bothy ballads in its first episode.\n\nSee also\n\n Adirondack lean-to\n Bolt-hole\n Bothy band\n Bothy ballad\n But and ben\u00a0\u2013 a simple two room cottage structure\n Castaway depot\n Cleit\n Mountain hut\u00a0\u2013 building located in the mountains intended to provide food and shelter to mountaineers, climbers and hikers\n Shieling\n Vernacular architecture\n Wilderness hut\u00a0\u2013 rent-free, open dwelling place for temporary accommodation, usually located in wilderness areas, national parks and along backpacking routes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nMountain Bothies Association\n\nEnglish architecture\nEnglish coast and countryside\nHouse types\nMountain huts\nRural Scotland\nScottish architecture\nTranshumance\nVernacular architecture\nWelsh coast and countryside", "machine_text": "A bothy is a basic shelter frequently found in remote regions of Scotland. These simple structures were traditionally used by agricultural and forestry workers who required cheap and convenient accommodation while working in remote areas. Today, bothies offer a rustic and back-to-basics experience for hikers, climbers, and other outdoor enthusiasts. The origin of the term bothy is unclear, but it is believed to come from the Gaelic word \"bothan\" which means small house or hut. In the early days, bothies were often no more than a single room with a fireplace, a bench, and a sleeping platform. Many bothies were made from local materials such as stone, turf, and peat, with thatched or corrugated iron roofs. Bothies are maintained by the Mountain Bothies Association (MBA), a charity that was founded in 1965 to restore and maintain these valuable structures. The MBA currently maintains around 100 bothies in Scotland, which are free for anyone to use. The non-profit organization relies on donations from both visitors and supporters to maintain these structures. Bothies are often located in remote areas, but many are easily accessible by foot or bicycle. Some bothies require a longer walk or hike to reach, but the journey is often part of the experience. Bothies offer a unique experience and opportunity to connect with nature, but it is essential to be prepared with appropriate equipment and supplies. Visitors are encouraged to respect bothies and leave them clean and tidy for the next users. In conclusion, bothies are an essential part of Scotland's cultural and outdoor heritage. These basic structures provide a valuable resource for outdoor enthusiasts and offer a unique opportunity to experience Scotland's remote and rugged landscapes. The Mountain Bothies Association does an excellent job of maintaining these structures, and both visitors and supporters are encouraged to help ensure their future.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1774993}

The series features contestants who are instructed to go on the run for a period of 25 (originally 28) days in mainland Great Britain, whilst avoiding a team of Hunters composed of former and serving police, intelligence personnel, and on-foot teams. During their time, the Hunters have access to contestants' personal information and use \"powers of the state\" such as ANPR, CCTV and call tracing to locate contestants. At times, the Hunters will use social media and monetary rewards to members of the public (and captured contestants) for information leading to a successful capture. On the final day, any remaining contestants must reach a designated \"extraction\" point before being captured, winning a share of \u00a3100,000.\n\nA celebrity adaptation, Celebrity Hunted, is also produced in aid of Stand Up To Cancer, where contestants compete for a shorter time period of 14 days.\n\nFormat and rules\n\nIn both the civilian and celebrity series, the contestants, now regarded as Fugitives, voluntarily go on the run in mainland Great Britain and must avoid detection from the Hunters, a group of current and former police and intelligence officials for 25 days (28 in the first two series and 14 for the celebrity series). From series 2, the contestants are escorted to a public area and given a head start before the Hunters begin their search and are given the names of their targets. Fugitives are given a debit card with a small amount of money provided by the production team, and a rucksack containing essential and personal items (though in series 5, the fugitives began with only the clothes on their back and no head start) During their time on the run the Fugitives can use any existing connections, or ask members of the general public, to assist them in avoiding capture.\n\nWhilst the Fugitives attempt to avoid using technology and thus detection, the Hunters use a vast array of different \"powers of the state\", such as closed surveillance, phone records and number plate recognition to pinpoint their chosen target. If one (or more) Fugitives have become difficult to locate, the Hunters use social media to encourage members of the public to reveal any information, and post content specifically for a Fugitive to reveal their location without realizing. Hunters may also be directly contacted by the public with any leads by telephone. Any member of the public with information leading to capture is compensated for their effort. Hunters additionally operate throughout the country through use of two-person ground teams that can deploy immediately under order of the Chief, the ground teams also perform reconnaissance at Fugitives' homes and attempt to goad family members and/or loved ones for information and may be observed to determine any irregularities in their daily routines.\n\nWhen a Fugitive is caught, they're told their time on the run is over and are escorted to a vehicle for debrief back at the Hunters headquarters.\n\nIn the final few days of the game, any Fugitives still on the run are given instructions of their 'extraction point' and a finite amount of time to get there. The Hunters are told of the last-known locations of the Fugitives and extend their efforts to figure out where the extraction is taking place. When a Fugitive successfully reaches the extraction point within the time-frame, they can no longer be caught by the Hunters are deemed as the Winner. Due to the nature of the show, there are two possible outcomes to the hunt. One or more Fugitives can reach the extraction point and win whilst the opposite can occur where every Fugitive is caught and the hunt prematurely ends (known as a \"clean sweep\").\n\nRegular series\n\nSeries 1 (2015)\nFourteen contestants were chosen and began in their respective hometowns. Fairoaks Airport in Surrey served as the extraction point.\n\nSeries 2 (2016)\nTen contestants were chosen and began in Milk Street in Birmingham. The Isle of Sheppey in Kent served as the extraction point.\n\nNotes\n\n\u25a0 Nick Cummings had an accomplice impersonate him outside a Leisure Centre, leading the hunters to believe they'd caught him, when Nick was actually 120 miles (193 km) away on a canal path.\n\n\u25a0 After Madu was caught, he was taken to Hunter HQ where Chief Peter Bleksley offered him \u00a31,000 for information of the whereabouts of his friend Ayo. Madu declined the offer but admitted he would've helped the hunters if they'd offered him \u00a350,000.\n\nSeries 3 (2018)\nNine contestants were chosen and began in Manchester city centre. The River Dart in Devon served as the extraction point. From this series onwards, the number of days to avoid capture was reduced to 25.\n\nNotes\n\n\u25a0 After the Fugitives learned the location of the extraction point, Alex Ayling was seen by the hunters on CCTV appearing to drop something into a drain. The hunters spent a considerable amount of time searching the drain for the item, which turned out only to be a receipt.\n\nSeries 4 (2019)\nTen contestants were chosen and began at the Port of Liverpool. The Bullring Shopping Centre in Birmingham served as the extraction point. This was the first time in any series that the Hunters won.\n\nSeries 5 (2020)\nTen contestants were chosen and began at A Bond Warehouse on Spike Island, Bristol. For this series, the fugitives started with no supplies or prior knowledge of their starting point. Amlwch Port in Anglesey served as the extraction point.\n\nSeries 6 \nIt was confirmed on the official Shine TV website that they were looking for applicants for a sixth series. The sixth series has been delayed due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in the UK.\n\nHunters\nA team of 30 specialists includes former and serving police and intelligence personnel, an ex CIA agent and cyber intelligence experts, who use the fugitives' online footprints to research and hunt them. The team has access to replicated powers of the state, including CCTV and ANPR. Before starting, all the fugitives gave permission to be tracked in the same way as the state might track a fugitive \u2013 their cash cards and phones are monitored, their houses searched and their friends and family questioned. The hunters also use media campaigns to recruit the general public into helping them, offering financial incentives. The team is split into two parts: (i) a team of operatives in the field who are in vehicles across the UK, on standby to follow orders from Hunted HQ to head to a particular location to follow up leads on fugitives' whereabouts or to question their friends and family; and (ii) a team in the Hunted HQ to gather Intelligence, which they then distribute to field teams.\n\nList of Chiefs\n\nCelebrity Hunted\nA celebrity series was confirmed by Channel 4 in 2017 with their appearance fees donated to Stand up To Cancer. The rules for the celebrity edition remained the same as the Hunted series, but the celebrities are given fourteen days to evade capture.\n\nSeries 1 (2017)\nSeven celebrities were chosen and began at Somerset House in London.

Herstmonceux Castle served as the extraction point.\n\nSeries 4 (2022)\nEight celebrities were chosen and began at the London Eye. The Extraction Point for this series was Formby Beach.\n\nProduction\nEach fugitive is filmed by a dedicated cameraperson, who follows the fugitives throughout their time on the run. While filming, the production team is split in two so that the team working with the hunters are separate from the team working with the fugitives, to provide a more realistic experience and prevent information leaking between one another. Freedom of Information requests are submitted by the Hunters to find the location of state-owned CCTV cameras positioned throughout the British mainland. When real footage could not be obtained, Channel 4 cameras capture footage that would have been available to the state, which is stored on a central database for the Hunters to access if requested. \n\nThe Hunters are overseen by Kevin O\u2019Leary, an independent adjudicator and former Head of Covert Operations for the Metropolitan Police who does not appear on the show. O'Leary's role as an adjudicator is to make sure that the information requested and gathered by the Hunters reflected the information that would be available to them in real life and within the appropriate time frame. O'Leary is the only person who has the power to release information to the Hunters and would only do so when considered that the Hunters have completed sufficient detective work to justify access to the information.\n\nRatings\nEpisode ratings are taken from BARB and include Channel 4 +1.\n\nHunted\n\nSeries 1 (2015)\n\nSeries 2 (2016)\n\nSeries 3 (2018)\n\nSeries 4 (2019)\n\nSeries 5 (2020)\n\nCelebrity Hunted\n\nSeries 1 (2017)\n\nSeries 2 (2018)\n\nSeries 3 (2019)\n\nCritical reception\nThe Telegraph review complimented the series, saying the \"game show element was very effective, playing with our instinctive tendency to take the side of the pursued, and skilfully edited to keep the tension high.\" The Daily Mirrors Adam Postan described the series as \"the biggest TV joke of the year\", pointing out that most of the surveillance powers were replicated by methods that were unexplained.\n\n International versions \n\nIn the United States, the show is produced by Endemol Shine North America under the same title Hunted, which premiered on 22 January 2017 on CBS.\n\nIn Spain, the show is produced by Movistar+ in collaboration with Shine Iberia under the title La huida (\"The Escape\"), which premiered on 8 April 2016 on #0.\n\nIn Denmark, the show is produced by Metronome Productions A/S under the title Menneskejagt (\"Manhunt\"), which premiered on 24 August 2016 on DR3.

Its tiny territory comprised Cerenzia itself, the (now defunct) hamlets of Verzino and Lucr\u00f2 and the castrum of Caccuri.\n\nIt is first documented in the Notitia Episcopatuum of the Patriarchate of Constantinople, edited under Byzantine emperor Leo VI the Wise (died 912).\n\nUntil the Norman conquest of Calabria (mid 11th century), it was in the sway of the above patriarchate and used its Greek-language Byzantine rite. A papal bulla by Pope Lucius III in 1183 explicitly mentions its being a suffragan of Santa Severina.\n\nNoted early (late 11th century) bishop Policronius, recuperated the 'Greek' abbey of Santa Maria di Altilia. The bishoprics rich gifts and possessions aroused greed among the local barons, especially Marchisorto, count of Crotone Stefano, tried to impose in 1205 his chaplain, Madio, instead of legitimate bishop Guglielmo, elected by the (cathedral) chapter.\n\nThe arrival of the Angevine rule spelled the diocese's decline, among more conflict with the feudal lords, requiring appeals to Metropolitan and Pope.\n\nMid Trecento (14th century), the area suffered health problems like malaria and from its poor position, even for drinking water, leading to the city being abandoned and the countryside depopulated by harsh feudal impositions.\n\nIn 1342 the phrase 'Bishop of Cerenzia and Cariati' was coined, after the new effective seat, and in 1437[4], Pope Eugenius IV formally erected a Diocese of Cariati, immediately placing it in personal union (aeque principaliter) with the old see of Cerenzia. Given the decay of Cerenzia and its episcopal palace, when the Council of Trento imposed on all bishops a fixed residence, Cariati at sea, despite its exposure to Ottoman Turkish raids, was chosen over sickly isolated Cerenzia.\n\nA pest epidemic in 1528 caused the town of Cerenzia and its five parishes to be abandoned, losing its diocesan archive. \u00c8 in questa occasione che and\u00f2 in gran parte perduto anche l'archivio. Visiting in the late Cinquecento, bishop Properzio Resta described its pitiful state, including cathedral and palace (Pesavento). Bishops' attempts in the Seicento and Settecento to restore the cathedral and build a new palace were undone by repeated, demotivating earthquakes.\n \nAs part of a reorganization of the dioceses of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, Pope Pius VII in 1818 incorporated the already united territory of the diocese of Cerenza into that of the diocese of Cariati, later merged itself into the present Archdiocese of Rossano-Cariati Vincenzio d'Avino,\n\nAs is customary, the bull referred to the see in adjectival form, and called it , suggesting as the Latin substantive (noun) form: .

The town was later conquered by the Romans in the 3rd century BC and then by the Byzantines in the 7th century AD. In the Middle Ages, Cerenzia was part of the Kingdom of Naples and it was often fought over by rival feudal lords. Today, Cerenzia is a small, quiet town with a rich cultural and historical heritage. It is known for its beautiful landscape, featuring rolling hills and vineyards, and for its olive groves that produce some of the finest olive oil in Italy. Some of the major attractions in Cerenzia include the picturesque historic center with its narrow streets and old buildings, as well as the Church of Santa Maria del Bosco, which dates back to the 17th century. The town also hosts several cultural and religious events throughout the year, including the Feast of Saint Joseph in March and the Feast of San Rocco in August.

He currently works as an actor and television persona, and runs own boxing gym in Tokyo, Japan.\n\nChildhood & Early Career \nTokashiki was born in Okinawa, but was raised in Takarazuka, Hyogo. He caused all sorts of trouble from an early age, and was infamous in his local town by the time he reached high school. He dropped out of school to begin training as a professional boxer, and traveled to Tokyo, where he entered the Kyoei boxing gym. The WBA Light flyweight champion Yoko Gushiken also trained at the Kyoei gym during the same period. Tokashiki made his professional debut in December, 1978.\n\nProfessional career \nTokashiki was a short (even for a light flyweight) and quick fighter, and quickly emerged as one of Japan's best youngest boxers. He did not mark a KO victory until his 12th professional fight in 1980.\n\nTokashiki compiled a record of 13-1-1 (2KOs) before challenging Hwan Jin Kim for the WBA Light flyweight title in December, 1981. Yoko Gushiken had lost the WBA title to Pedro Flores, after defending it 13 times. Flores in turn lost his title to Kim and Tokashiki set out to avenge his gymmate's Gushiken's loss of his title. Tokashiki won the world title with by unanimous decision, but a scandal involving the Kyoei gym's management was revealed the same day, and Tokashiki's victory was marred by controversy, since he and the previous champion, Gushiken, both trained with the gym.\n\nRegardless, Tokashiki compiled 5 straight defenses, but lost his title to Lupe Madera, (who he had fought two previous times in defenses) after he was injured in the 4th round. Tokashiki got a rematch in October, 1983, but lost  a close unanimous decision in 15 rounds. The WBA would have allowed another rematch, but Tokashiki did not want to fight Madera for a fifth time, and decided to challenge Korean boxer Jung Koo Chang for the WBC Light flyweight title instead.\n\nThe match took place in Korea, where Chang was already a national hero. This was the only time Tokashiki fought outside Japan in his career, and he knew he had to win by KO to capture the title. Tokashiki was aggressive from the first round, and pinned the champion against the corner, when he was knocked down for the first time in his career with a counter left hook. However, Tokashiki managed to tire out the champion by the 5th round, and Chang showed fatigue, clinching repeatedly, and slipping in the 8th round. Chang's corner bought time by having to retape the champion's gloves twice during rounds, and in the 9th round, Chang surprised Tokashiki with a sudden flurry of punches. Tokashiki was staggered, and the referee immediately stopped the fight to declare Chang the victory, despite the fact that Tokashiki had remained standing as Chang collapsed to the canvas after hearing that he had won. Chang was only 21 years old at the time, he defended the WBC title 15 times. Tokashiki announced his retirement shortly after this fight. His record was 19-4-2 (4KOs).\n\nPost Retirement \nLike many other Japanese boxers, Tokashiki became a television persona after retiring from boxing, and has appeared on several variety television shows. He has also worked as an actor, and took the role of boxer Fighting Harada in a television drama series in 1990. His appearances on television have decreased lately, but he created the Tokashiki Boxing Gym in Tokyo, and currently works as a trainer there. He also petitioned the court to order Iwao Hakamada's retrial.\n\nSee also \nList of WBA world champions\nList of Japanese boxing world champions\nBoxing in Japan\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\n \n \n Tokashiki Boxing Gym (Japanese)\n\n1960 births\nLiving people\nPeople from Okinawa Prefecture\nWorld Boxing Association champions\nWorld boxing champions\nJapanese boxing trainers\nJapanese male boxers\nBoxing commentators\nLight-flyweight boxers", "machine_text": "Katsuo Tokashiki (born 2nd May 1974) is a Japanese basketball coach and retired professional basketball player.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Legend tripping\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Legend tripping is a name bestowed by folklorists and anthropologists on an adolescent practice (containing elements of a rite of passage) in which a usually furtive nocturnal pilgrimage is made to a site which is alleged to have been the scene of some tragic, horrific, and possibly supernatural event or haunting. The practice has been documented most thoroughly to date in the United States.\n\nSites for legend trips \nWhile the stories that attach to the sites of legend tripping vary from place to place, and sometimes contain a kernel of historical truth, there are a number of motifs and recurring themes in the legends and the sites.  Abandoned buildings, remote bridges, tunnels, caves, rural roads, specific woods or other uninhabited (or semi-uninhabited) areas, and especially cemeteries are frequent sites of legend-tripping pilgrimages.\n\nReactions and controversies \nLegend-tripping is a mostly harmless, perhaps even beneficial, youth recreation. It allows young people to demonstrate their courage in a place where the actual physical risk is likely slight. However, in what Ellis calls \"ostensive abuse,\" the rituals enacted at the legend-tripping sites sometimes involve trespassing, vandalism, and other misdemeanors, and sometimes acts of animal sacrifice or other blood ritual. These transgressions then sometimes lead to local moral panics that involve adults in the community, and sometimes even the mass media.  These panics often further embellish the prestige of the legend trip to the adolescent mind. In at least one notorious case, years of destructive legend-tripping, amounting to an \"ostensive frenzy,\" led to the fatal shooting of a legend-tripper near Lincoln, Nebraska followed by the wounding of the woman whose house had become the focus of the ostension. The panic over youth Satanism in the 1980s was fueled in part by graffiti and other ritual activities engaged in by legend-tripping youths.\n\nAssociated places in the United States \n\n The Black Agnes statue, formerly in Pikesville, Maryland and now in Washington, DC\n The Black Angel monument at Oakland Cemetery in Iowa City, Iowa.\n The grave of Captain Frances McHarry in Harrison County, Indiana\n Goat Man's Grave near Rolla, Missouri.\n The Lake View Public School, also known as the  Gore Orphanage, near Cleveland, Ohio\n Our Lady of the Angels School in Chicago, Illinois and its Fire Memorial in nearby Queen of Heaven Cemetery.\n Ong's Hat, New Jersey \n The Myrtle Hill Cemetery in Medina County, Ohio\n The Pope Lick Trestle in Louisville, Kentucky, home to the satyr-like Pope Lick Monster\n Hexenkopf Rock in Williams Township, Pennsylvania\n Rehmeyer's Hollow in Shrewsbury, Pennsylvania\n The Waverly Hills Sanatorium, an abandoned hospital for tuberculosis victims, in Louisville, Kentucky\n Old Louisville, reported to be the most haunted neighborhood in the United States\n Sweet Hollow Road and Mount Misery Road in Huntington, New York\n Satansville on Cossart Road near Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania\n The New Jersey Pine Barrens, said to be home to the Jersey Devil\n Mudhouse Mansion in Fairfield County, Ohio \n The Baird Chair monument in Kirksville, Missouri\nThe Hornet Spook Light twelve miles southwest of Joplin, Missouri\n Stull Cemetery in Stull, Kansas, claimed to be a \"gateway to Hell\"\n Old Alton Bridge south of Denton, Texas\n Bunny Man Bridge near Clifton, Virginia\n Manteno State Hospital in Manteno, Illinois\n Devil's Tramping Ground south of Siler City, North Carolina, near Harper's Crossroads.\n\nSee also \n\n Bloody Mary (folklore)\n Madam Koi Koi\n Ghost hunting\n Haunted house\n La Llorona\n Slender Man\n Siguanaba (Salvadoran Folklore)\n Stand by Me (film)\n The Devil's Chair (urban legend)\n Picnic at Hanging Rock\n Urban legend\n\nReferences\n\n Aliens, Ghosts, and Cults: Legends We Live, by Bill Ellis (2001) \n \"Legend trip\", entry in American Folklore: An Encyclopedia, ed.

This activity is popular among teenagers and young adults who are intrigued by the mystery and excitement of these stories and want to experience them firsthand. Legend tripping has been part of the global cultural heritage for centuries. In many parts of the world, people have created stories and legends about supernatural beings and events that have occurred in certain places. These stories often involve ghosts, witches, monsters, or mythical creatures and are passed down through generations. In the United States, legend tripping became popular in the mid-20th century. This was when urban legends started to gain popularity, and young people began seeking out the locations associated with them. These locations included cemeteries, abandoned buildings, and other rumored haunted places. There are different types of legend tripping activities. Some involve looking for specific objects or symbols that are believed to have supernatural powers. Others involve exploring abandoned places or conducting rituals to summon supernatural beings. While legend tripping can be a thrilling and exciting experience, it is not without risks. Exploring abandoned buildings and venturing into remote areas can be dangerous, especially at night. Additionally, some people have reported experiencing psychological distress or paranormal activity during these trips, which can have lasting effects. Overall, legend tripping is a fascinating aspect of folklore and cultural heritage that continues to capture the imagination of people around the world. While the risks associated with it should not be taken lightly, the intrigue and excitement of exploring the unknown continue to drive many to participate in this activity.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 441464}

He began to study medicine at the Karolinska Institute in 1908 and became a Licentiate of Medicine in 1916. He went to Paris in 1919, where he became acquainted with the nurse Signe Dahl and they later married in 1920.  In addition to his work and social commitment, in the early 1920s H\u00f6jer researched vitamin C and its role in connective tissue cell maturation. He submitted his thesis in Stockholm in 1924 for PhD degree as Studies in scurvy, and then became the Associate Professor of Hygiene in the Physiological Institute at Lund University.\n\nIn 1930, he was appointed as the city physician () of Malm\u00f6 and subsequently, in 1935, became Director General of the National Swedish Board of Health, a post he left in 1952. During his time on the Medical Board, he made several reforms in terms of preventive care, including family planning, maternal assistance and care of infants as well as dental services. Additionally during that time, the Vipeholm experiments on dental caries were conducted.\n\nH\u00f6jer was appointed to the UN's expert commission for economic affairs and its housing commission. He was sent as a special officer for improving medical education in India at the request of Travancore-Cochin state (present-day Kerala state). H\u00f6jer was appointed as the Principal of the Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala, a position he held until 1954.\n\nAfter retirement, he worked on international issues, including the effects of the Vietnam War.\n\nThe H\u00f6jer Investigation \nH\u00f6jer led the Board of Health study in 1948 on health care reorganization. The study suggested a focus on preventive care and strengthening of provincial medical offices. The proposal was motivated in particular by the fact that the proportion of primary care physicians had declined because of the sharp increase in hospital doctors. In the study, the Medical Board argued against the Medical Association's view with regard to primary care. The report advocated a polyclinic model, where outpatient health care would be free and community-run.\n\nThe H\u00f6jer study was the first more comprehensive attempt to analyze the problems in outpatient care. It suggested the establishment of health centers of various kinds. The larger centers would include both specialists and general practitioners and would be located in hospitals. The minor ones would have two or more GPs and be located in the provincial doctors' stations. H\u00f6jer encountered considerable resistance from the medical professionals. He was exposed to virulent press campaign from colleagues calling for his resignation. As a result of complaints the commission's proposals could not be realized.\n\nControversies \nH\u00f6jer's combination of pacifism, socialism, anti-clericalism, anti-Nazism and temperance led to political persecution in Sydsvenska Dagbladet and Aftonbladet, Swedish newspapers. He was dismissed from a job as a teacher in the Southern Sweden Nursing School on the grounds that he held a lecture on sexual health. As city physician () in Malm\u00f6, he tried to address air pollution from the Scanian Cement factory at Limhamn in Malm\u00f6. The company director threatened Malm\u00f6 municipality, stating the company would move to another location if they followed the doctor's recommendations.\n\nConcerning Jewish refugees, H\u00f6jer met stiff resistance from the management of the Swedish medical establishment. When a Jewish ophthalmologist had to leave his home after the German occupation of Danzig and tried to find work in Sweden, the medical professionals in the country sued to stop it, citing various reasons. A campaign with a hint of anti-Semitism was taken up by the medical establishments. When the Medical Board in 1939 planned to invite 12 Jewish specialty physicians to Sweden, the doctors' associations protested, suggesting it would lead to unemployment. , a protest arranged by the student body at Uppsala University, also spoke out against accepting Jewish refugees. The royal family intervened, and H\u00f6jer was called to the ruler, Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf, with the proposal that Sweden should accept only a small number of Jewish doctors who were fleeing Hitler's persecution. \"He asked me pleadingly to refrain from proposals and actions, which could put the unity of the Swedish people in danger. I answered respectfully but firmly \u2013 with the Court Marshal listening in the background \u2013 that I obviously did not want to increase the government's difficulties, but I found that the request is primarily aimed to appease the anti-Semitic circles. It would be ignominious if Sweden were to betray people in danger. The Crown Prince reiterated his warning. I declared I would keep it in mind the future, and would do it if my conscience allows. We parted without further discussion\". H\u00f6jer also asked to increase the number of doctors in the country, by importing Austrian physicians in 1950, which again was opposed by the Medical Association.\n\nBibliography \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n  (autobiography)\n\nReferences\n\n1890 births\n1974 deaths\n20th-century Swedish physicians\nSwedish healthcare managers\nPeople from Gotland\nKarolinska Institute alumni", "machine_text": "Axel H\u00f6jer (born May 21, 1996) is a Swedish professional football player who currently plays as a forward for Superettan team Dalkurd FF.

In particular, some of his policies were criticized as being too favorable to the state's powerful oil and gas interests, and he faced significant challenges in dealing with the outbreak of World War II. After leaving office in 1944, Stovall returned to private law practice. He remained active in politics, however, and he played a key role in the Democratic Party's resurgence in Louisiana during the 1950s and 1960s. He passed away on May 21st, 1970, at the age of 77. Overall, Pleasant A. Stovall was a notable figure in Louisiana politics who worked tirelessly to improve the lives of his constituents. His legacy as a champion of civil rights and progressive politics continues to influence Louisiana politics to this day.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 31517333}

He spent a number of years at the end of his life as an agent of New France among the Miami.\n\nVincennes was born in Quebec on 19 January 1668. His father, tanner Fran\u00e7ois Byssot de la Rivi\u00e8re, was granted a seigniory for his tannery on the St. Lawrence River in 1672. Later, he became a ward of his brother-in-law, Louis Joliet, who entered him in the seminary at Quebec.\n\nVincennes married Marguerite Forestier in Montreal in 1696. They had four daughters and three sons, including Fran\u00e7ois-Marie.\n\nThrough the efforts of his godfather, Jean Baptiste Talon, he secured a commission as ensign in the French marine. In 1696, the Comte de Frontenac appointed him as commander of the French outposts southeast of Lake Michigan (in present-day northeastern Indiana). Here he became good friends with the Miami people, settling first at the St. Joseph River, and, in 1704, establishing a trading post and fort at Kekionga, the location of present-day Fort Wayne, Indiana.  The same year, the current governor-general of New France, Philippe de Rigaud de Vaudreuil, wrote the French court to emphasize the importance of Bissot's services to New France among the Miami people.\n\nIn 1712, Vincennes served as second in command at Fort Detroit. In this position, he resided with the Miami to keep them from falling under the control of the British.  He helped defeat the forces of the Fox Nation and acquired a young Fox slave, whom he named Fran\u00e7ois-Michel. This slave eventually was owned by his son, Fran\u00e7ois-Marie Bissot.\n\nHe died in 1719 at Kekionga and was succeeded by his son as commander of the French in Miami country.

In 1684, he accompanied explorer Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, on a voyage to the Great Lakes region. The voyage took Bissot to the Wabash River, where he established a fur trading post and a fort. In 1702, Bissot was appointed the official commander of the fort, which became known as Fort Vincennes in his honor. Under Bissot's leadership, the fort became a center of trade and commerce in the region, and he developed strong relationships with the local Native American tribes, particularly the Miami. However, Bissot's tenure as commander was not without controversy. In 1706, he ordered the execution of a French soldier, Michel Brouillet, for desertion. This action angered the soldier's family and led to a prolonged legal battle that lasted for years. Nevertheless, Bissot remained in command of Fort Vincennes until his death in 1719. After Bissot's death, Fort Vincennes fell into disrepair, and the area came under British control. The fort would later become a significant site during the American Revolutionary War and the subsequent Northwest Indian War. Today, Vincennes, Indiana, is named in honor of Bissot, and the area surrounding the fort is a National Historic Landmark.

This antibiotic forms channels in the cell membrane through which cations inside the cell begin to leave, thus disrupting the ion potential and eventually killing the cell. Gramicidin B makes up 6% of Gramicidin D while Gramicidin A and C make up 80% and 14% respectively. Gramicidin D is a linear pentadecapeptide made up of 15 amino acids. The 11th amino acid in these chains leads to the three different types of gramicidins. Gramicindin A contains tryptophan in the 11th position while B and C have phenylalanine and tyrosine respectively.\n\nBiosynthesis\nGramicidin B is composed of 15 amino acids that alternate between the L and D configuration. It is a linear peptide that is formed by four nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), LgrABCD.\n\nThe N terminus is protected by a formyl group while the C terminus is protected by an ethanolamine.  This is done so that the peptide will not have \u2018open ends\u2019 that are subjected to degradation by proteases. It has also been noted that the amino acids that are in Gramicidin B are solely hydrophobic amino acids. This is causes the peptide to be insoluble in water and unable to form zwitterions. Due to the alternating configuration of the amino acids, a beta helix with all the side chains pointing outward is formed.\n\nReferences \n\nPolypeptide antibiotics", "machine_text": "Gramicidin B is a cyclic polypeptide antibiotic first isolated from Bacillus brevis by Dubos in 1939. It is composed of two hexadecapeptides that form a complex with cations to create a channel in membranes, leading to loss of ions and eventually cell death. Gramicidin B has potent antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Gramicidin B was first discovered during screening of soil samples for antibiotic activity. It was subsequently identified as a cyclic peptide composed of alternating D- and L-amino acids, with a unique structure that allows it to form ion channels in bacterial cell membranes. The peptide molecule has 15 amino acids, with alternating D- and L-configuration of amino acids, and a linear structure. It has the ability to complex with cations, such as potassium, to form a channel in membranes. The mechanism of action of gramicidin B involves the formation of a channel in bacterial cell membranes. The peptide forms a helix in the membrane that allows the passage of cations, leading to loss of ion balance and eventually cell death. Gramicidin B is highly selective for bacterial membranes because it requires a specific environment to form its channels and is not active against human cells. Gramicidin B has been used as an antibacterial agent in topical preparations for the treatment of skin infections. However, due to its poor oral bioavailability and potential toxicity, it is not suitable for systemic use. Gramicidin B is commonly used as a model peptide for studying ion channel formation in membranes, due to its unique structure and mechanism of action. In conclusion, Gramicidin B is a cyclic polypeptide antibiotic that shows potent activity against gram-positive bacteria by forming ion channels in bacterial cell membranes. It has been used in topical preparations for skin infections and is commonly used as a model peptide for studying ion channel formation in membranes.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Dawachi\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Dawachi (; ; died 1759) was the last khan of the Dzungar Khanate from 1753 until his defeat at the hands of Qing and Mongol forces at Ili in 1755.\n\nDawachi belonged to the highest rank of Dzungar aristocracy. He traced his ancestry back directly to Erdeni Batur (died 1635), the founder of the Dzungar Khanate. His grandfather was Tsering Dondup. His brother, Tsewang Rabtan (1643-1727), led the Dzungar invasion and occupation of Tibet in 1717. His father was the second cousin of Galdan Tseren, the Khong Tayiji of the Dzungar Khanate from 1727 to 1745.\n\nBackground\nDawachi, whose pasture lands were centered in the Tarbagatai region first came to prominence when he and his Khoit-Oirat ally Amursana opposed the rule of Lama Dorji (1728-1753), who had seized the Dzungar throne after assassinating his brother Tsewang Dorji Namjal in 1750. The reign of Lama Dorji's father, Galdan Tseren, represented a resurgence of the Dzungar Khanate's political, military and economic influence in central Asia after the defeats of Galdan Boshugtu Khan's forces by the Qing army fifty years earlier. However, when Galdan Tseren died in 1745, his three sons battled over succession. The political anarchy that ensued all but eliminated the gains made under Galdan Tseren. In 1751, Lama Dorji's pre-emptive military strike defeated forces loyal to Dawachi, who was forced to flee across the border into Kazakh Khanate territory. With a thousand of his men, he and Amursana marched to Ili where they surprised Lama Dorji and killed him on 13 January 1753. Other sources claim that Lama Dorji was killed by his own troops in December 1752.\n\nDawachi seizes power \nFollowing the death of Lama Dorji, Dawachi claimed the title taisha of the Dzungars based on his aristocratic lineage. Amursana, although a prince, was of considerably simpler descent and was of Khoit rather than Dzungar origin. Nevertheless, Amursana, who had married the daughter of Ablai Khan, leader of the neighboring Kazakh Khanate, and had negotiated the support of various Oirat clan leaders, called on Dawachi to divide the Khanate's lands between them as Amursana said he was promised. Dawachi refused and instead attacked Amursana in 1754, forcing him to flee east to Khovd where he swore allegiance to the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing Empire. The Qianlong Emperor agreed to support Amursana's plans to defeat Dawachi, which included the retaking of Ili and neighboring Kashgar. Meanwhile, most of the Oirat Khoshut had followed Amursana and had defected to the Qing, leaving Dawachi with only the Dzungars under his control.\n\nThe Ili Campaign\n\nLate 1754 and early 1755, in an attempt to definitively settle the 60-year-old Dzungaria problem, the Qianlong Emperor gave orders for a final advance on Ili. Approximately 200,000 soldiers were mobilized for a campaign against Dawachi. Many were Khalkha Mongols, who contributed tens of thousands of horses and mules to the effort. Amursana was made Border Pacification Vice-general of the Left of the Northern Route Army. General Ban Di took supreme command of the army, which set out from Uliastai in March 1755 and linked up with the Western Route Army under Yong Chang and Salar (\u85a9\u5587\u52d2) three months later. The combined forces reached Bortala in June 1755. Militarily, the campaign was much more successful than expected. There were mass desertions among Dawachi's forces when they learned that Amursana was part of the approaching army. In desperation, Dawachi sent a delegation to Beijing led by his son, who expressed his father's desire to become a vassal of the Qing Empire. The Qing army did not respond and continued the campaign.\n\nAfter several skirmishes and small scale battles along the Ili River, the Qing army led by Zhaohui approached Ili and forced Dawachi to withdraw south west to the Gedeng Mountains where he made a last stand with his remaining 10,000 men. Dawachi's army was routed and Dawachi himself was captured by Hakim Beg Hojis who sent him on to Beijing. There, the Qianlong Emperor showed leniency, granting Dawachi a princely title and permitting him to marry a princess from the Qing imperial family. The last years of Dawachi's life were spent in Kalgan where, in 1759, he died from excessive alcohol consumption.\n\nReferences\n\n1759 deaths\nYear of birth unknown\n18th-century Mongol rulers\nDzungar Khanate\nMongol khans\nOirats", "machine_text": "Dawachi is a small village located in the Western Province of Saudi Arabia.

He played in Major League Baseball as a left-handed pitcher between 1898 and 1919. After the 1919 season he continued to make periodic appearances as a pinch hitter for many years, until his final game at the age of 57. As a player, Altrock was a member of two World Series winning teams and then, won a third World Series as a coach. He was a coach for the Washington Senators for many years.\n\nBiography\nAltrock was born in Cincinnati, to German immigrant parents. He was one of the better pitchers in baseball for a brief period from  to  with the Chicago White Sox. He was instrumental in the White Sox World Series championship in 1906, going 20\u201313 with a 2.06 ERA in the regular season and 1\u20131 with a Series-best 1.00 ERA against the Chicago Cubs.\n\nAn arm injury after 1906 ruined his career, but he hung on with the White Sox and Washington Senators until , though he pitched very little after  and made sporadic pinch-hitting appearances after that, including one in  (facing Rube Walberg of the Philadelphia Athletics) at 57 years of age. He appeared in major league games in five decades, one of only two players to do this (Minnie Mi\u00f1oso is the other); he is one of only 29 players in baseball history to have appeared in major league games in four decades.\n\nAltrock became a coach for the Senators in  and remained on the Washington staff through , a 42-year skein that represents the longest consecutive-year tenure of a coach with the same franchise in baseball history. Some Senator scorecards continued to list Altrock as a \"coach emeritus\" even after his formal retirement.\n\nDuring that time, he was noted for his antics in the coaching box and teamed with Al Schacht, the \"Clown Prince of Baseball\", for a dozen years to perform comedy routines on baseball fields in the days before official mascots. Schacht and Altrock also took their antics to the vaudeville stage where they appeared in a comedy routine. Ironically, at the height of their collaboration, Schacht and Altrock developed a deep personal animosity and stopped speaking with each other off the field. During their famous comic re-enactments of the Dempsey\u2013Tunney championship boxing match, many speculated that they pulled no punches as they rained blows on each other.\n\nAn anecdote, probably apocryphal, has been printed in some baseball books about a quip by Altrock during his coaching days with the Senators. A batter had hit a ball into the stands and it was not known whether it was fair or foul. The umpire, who had been the target of Altrock's gibes, made the call and shortly afterward a woman was carried from the stands on a litter. The umpire asked Altrock if the ball had hit the woman. In his clear voice, Nick answered, \"No. You called that one right and she passed out from shock.\"\n\nHe was the second oldest position player to play in a major league game when he played in 1924 at the age of 47.\n\nAltrock lived for many years in the Columbia Heights neighborhood of Washington, D.C., with his wife Eleanor, and died at age 88 in 1965.

In 1911, Altrock was traded to the Washington Senators where he played for two more seasons before retiring as a player. He then became a coach for the Senators and worked closely with young pitchers, including future Hall of Famer Walter Johnson. Altrock was known for his sense of humor and was often called upon to entertain fans during rain delays and between innings. After his coaching and playing career ended, Altrock remained active in baseball as a scout for several major league teams. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame as a coach in 1964, one year before his death. Nick Altrock was an important figure in the early days of baseball and his legacy lives on today.

Albertine grew up in a rich and intellectual environment, surrounded by the greatest minds of her time. She was educated by private tutors and attended the salons of her mother and other influential women, such as Madame de Genlis and Madame de Stael.

Albertine's major works include \"Corinne, or Italy\" (1807), a novel set in Italy and praised for its romantic and picturesque descriptions of the country's landscapes and people, and \"De l'Allemagne\" (1810), a study of German literature and culture that had a profound influence on European intellectual circles. Albertine's writing was characterized by her intense emotionalism, her strong individualism, and her commitment to liberal and feminist ideals. She was an important figure in the Romantic movement and a precursor of the feminist movement.

This genus is classified within the order Aulopiformes and is notable for its elongated body and extremely large eyes. The name Ticinepomis comes from the Latin words 'tincetum', meaning \"needle\", and 'pomum', meaning \"fruit\", referring to the slender body and the round head of the fish. Ticinepomis fossils have been found throughout Europe, particularly in the Eocene-aged limestone deposits of the Paris Basin. The first fossil specimen was described by French paleontologist Edouard Leaudey in 1912, and since then, several other specimens have been discovered and studied. Based on these specimens, it is estimated that Ticinepomis grew to be around 10 centimeters long. The distinctive characteristics of Ticinepomis suggest that it was an active predator, likely feeding on smaller fish and crustaceans. Its large eyes would have allowed it to see well in low-light environments, and its elongated body would have provided it with speed and maneuverability. Studies of its fossilized stomach contents have revealed small fish and crustaceans, further supporting the hypothesis of a predatory lifestyle. Ticinepomis is one of several extinct bony fish that roamed the oceans during the Eocene epoch, alongside other fascinating species such as the giant Eocene shark, the sea cow, and the ancient penguin. Its fossilized remains have provided valuable insights into the evolution of fish and the diversity of marine life during the Eocene. Today, Ticinepomis serves as an important research subject for paleontologists and biologists seeking to understand the history of life on our planet.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 18546005}

Her awards include a Pulitzer Prize for Criticism.\n\nBiography\n\nEarly life\nKakutani, a Japanese American, was born on January 9, 1955, in New Haven, Connecticut. She is the only child of Yale mathematician Shizuo Kakutani and his wife Keiko (\"Kay\") Uchida.  Her father was born in Japan, her mother was a second-generation Japanese-American who was raised in Berkeley, California. Michiko received her B.A. in English literature from Yale University in 1976, where she studied under author and Yale writing professor John Hersey, among others.\n\nCareer\nKakutani initially worked as a reporter for The Washington Post, and then from 1977 to 1979 for Time magazine, where Hersey had worked. In 1979, she joined The New York Times as a reporter.\n\nKakutani was a literary critic for The New York Times from 1983 until her retirement in 2017. Her occasionally harsh reviews of  prominent authors have garnered attention and sometimes criticism. For example, in 2006, Kakutani called Jonathan Franzen's The Discomfort Zone \"an odious self-portrait of the artist as a young jackass.\" Franzen subsequently called Kakutani \"the stupidest person in New York City\". In 2012, Kakutani wrote a negative review of Nassim Nicholas Taleb's Antifragile. In 2018, Taleb stated in his book Skin in the Game that \"someone has to have read the book to notice that a reviewer is full of baloney, so in the absence of skin in the game, reviewers such as Michiko Kakutani\" can \"go on forever without anyone knowing\" that they are fabricating and drunk. According to Kira Cochrane in The Guardian, such counterattacks may have bolstered Kakutani's reputation as commendably \"fearless.\"\n\nShe has been known to write reviews in the voice of movie or book characters, including Brian Griffin, Austin Powers, Holden Caulfield, Elle Woods of Legally Blonde, and Truman Capote's character Holly Golightly in Breakfast at Tiffany's.\n\nOn July 19, 2007, The New York Times published a pre-release story written by Kakutani about Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. An account of the ensuing controversy, including the critical comments of some Harry Potter fans, can be found on the newspaper's Public Editor's blog.\n\nKakutani was parodied in the essay \"I Am Michiko Kakutani\" by one of her former Yale classmates, Colin McEnroe.\n\nKakutani announced that she was stepping down as chief book critic of the Times on July 27, 2017. In an article summing her book reviewing career, a writer in Vanity Fair called her \"the most powerful book critic in the English-speaking world\" and credited her with boosting the careers of George Saunders, Mary Karr, David Foster Wallace, Jonathan Franzen, Ian McEwan, Martin Amis, and Zadie Smith.\n\nIn July 2018, Kakutani published a book criticizing the Trump administration titled The Death of Truth: Notes on Falsehood in the Age of Trump.\n\nKakutani is a fan of the New York Yankees. Her aunt, Yoshiko Uchida, was an author of children's books.\n\nMedia references\n A fictionalized account of Kakutani's life entitled \"Michiko Kakutani and the Sadness of the World!\" was published in the online and print magazine Essays & Fictions.\n She is referenced in an episode of the HBO series Sex and the City. In \"Critical Condition\" (season 5, episode 6), Carrie Bradshaw releases a book that Kakutani reviews. Various characters deem the critic's name \"too hard to pronounce,\" including Miranda Hobbes, who memorably states, \"Just don't say her name again \u2014 it will drive me over the edge.\"\n She was referenced in an episode of Luca Guadagnino's limited HBO series We Are Who We Are. During the episode \"Right Here, Right Now V\", Fraser looks up Kakutani's review of The Kindly Ones after the book is recommended by his crush Jonathan.\n Comedian and Saturday Night Live cast member Bowen Yang performed an impression of Kakutani during his audition for the show, later joking that she was perfect for an impression since many are unaware of what she looks or sounds like.\n\nWorks\nThe Death of Truth: Notes on Falsehood in the Age of Trump (2018) \nEx-Libris: 100+ Books to Read and Re-read (2020)\n\nAwards\n1998: Pulitzer Prize for Criticism\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n .\n .\n .\n .\n .\n\n1955 births\nLiving people\nWriters from New Haven, Connecticut\nAmerican women writers\nAmerican writers of Japanese descent\nAmerican literary critics\nWomen literary critics\nYale University alumni\nPulitzer Prize for Criticism winners\nThe New York Times Pulitzer Prize winners\nThe Washington Post journalists\nTime (magazine) people\nAmerican women journalists of Asian descent\n21st-century American women\nAmerican women critics", "machine_text": "Michiko Kakutani is an American literary critic and author who was born on January 9, 1955, in New Haven, Connecticut.

First of all, the establishment of an organization that could improve the drinking water supply of residential settlements in Baku, Sumgayit and Absheron peninsula began. So, the Absheron Regional Joint Stock Water Company was created in 1995, under the decision of the National Assembly of Azerbaijan based on the main and circulating assets of the two former state-owned enterprises - \"Kommunsenayesutehjizaty\" Production Association and \"AzSuGEO\" Scientific-Research Institute.\n\nAt that period of time, for the first time among the CIS, a loan was granted to the water sector by international financial institutions for the \"Greater Baku Water Supply Rehabilitation Project\"  and this project was successfully implemented.\n\nDrinking water supply \n\nIn 2004, the repartition of water resources in Azerbaijan is as follow: 30% rivers, 40% lakes, 20% reservoirs and the rest between springs and groundwater. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), in 2008 7% of the consumed water in Azerbaidjan was coming from underground sources.\n\nMingachevir reservoir of the Kura river is used as a source of drinking water by the population.\n\nReservoirs\n\nMingachevir reservoir \nThis Mingachevir water reservoir was created on the Kura river. The construction of the Mingachevir reservoir and the Hydroelectric Power Station was completed in 1953. The total capacity of the reservoir at the normal level (83 m) is 15730 mln m3, useful volume of it is 8210 mln m3. The area of the reservoir is 605\u00a0km2, the volume is 16.1\u00a0km3, the length is 70\u00a0km, the maximum width is 18\u00a0km, the average depth is 26 m, the deepest is 75 m.\n\nJeyranbatan reservoir \nJeyranbatan water reservoir was established in 1955 due to increasing demand for drinking and technical water in Baku and Sumgayit. The capacity of the reservoir is 186 million m3, the useful volume is 150 mln m3. The length of the reservoir is 8.74\u00a0km, the maximum width is 2.15\u00a0km, the length of the coastline is 23.3\u00a0km, the maximum depth is 28.5 meters.\n\nSanitation \nIn the sewerage sector, Baku wastewater network serves 72% population of the city, but only 50% of the water is treated. 90% of the treated water is biologically processed and only 10% is mechanically processed. Wastewater treatment plants are available in 16 cities and regions; most of them are partially or completely useless. In most cases, the quality of water supplied to the population does not meet the required standards. The state works with donor communities to take the necessary measures to address these problems. The Azerbaijani government has adopted a program on the construction of water supply and sewage systems in more than 60 small towns (regional centers) in the country.  The state has already started to implement more than 20 such projects.  At the same time, local water supply projects are being implemented.\n\n\"Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project\" \nThe Loan agreement between the Government of Azerbaijan and the Japan International Cooperation Agency on the \"Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project \" was signed on 29 May 2009 and entered into force on 30 June 2009. The project covers rehabilitation of water supply and sanitation systems in Gusar, Khachmaz, Khizi, Gobustan and Naftalan.\n\nGusar City \n\"The project on rehabilitation of water supply and sanitation system of Gusar town\" has been calculated to improve drinking water and sanitation services of 19,600 people in Gusar city, taking into account perspective development until 2030. Within the project, drinking water supply will be improved in 12,000 people living in Balakusar, Hasanqala, Old Khudat, Chilagir, Yukhari Layar, Gayakend, Khuray villages of Gusar region and Chartepe, Orta Khuch, Ashagi Khuch villages of Guba region.\n\nConstruction and installation works on the project started on April 19, 2012. At the first stage of the project, a drainage water facility with a capacity of 102 liters per day or 8800 cubic meters per day was constructed in Gusarchay river to provide Gusar and its surrounding villages with drinking water. At the same time, three water reservoirs with a total capacity of 1,000 cubic meters, a 2.8\u00a0km long inter-reservoir water line and a new water chlorinating building were constructed.\n\nKhachmaz City \nImplementation of the project on rehabilitation of drinking water supply and sanitation systems of Khachmaz city started on 19 April 2012. The project has been calculated to improve drinking water and sanitation services of 47,000 people in Khachmaz, the water supply of 11,000 people in Qobuqyagi, Armudpadar, Garaychi, Garagurdlu and Old Khachmaz villages of the region.\n\nIn the first stage of the project, the Uchkun spring, (which is the main water source of the city) was rehabilitated, 2\u00a0km long trunk water line (400\u00a0mm) was constructed, 2 reservoirs with a total capacity of 10,000 cubic meters were built and 1,6\u00a0km water line between this reservoirs was constructed.\n\nKhizi City \nConstruction and installation works on the project started in 2012 and at the first stage of project, water intake facilities were built in Gars (430 cubic meters / day) and Yeddibulag (40 cubic meters / day) resources, and an 8.4\u00a0km long trunk water line was constructed in Khizi.\n\nNaftalan city \nImplementation of the project for reconstruction of drinking water supply and sewerage system of Naftalan city started in early 2013.\n\nGobustan City \nA groundbreaking ceremony for reconstruction of Gobustan drinking water supply and sanitation system was held on May 10, 2015.\n\nWater use\nAccording to FAO's report, the major part of the water in Azerbaijan is used for agriculture and livestock (77%), the rest is shared between industry (19%) and municipalities (4%) as of 2005.\n\n\"Second National Water Supply and Sanitation Services\" project \nFinancing agreement on the project \"Second National Water Supply and Sanitation Services\" have been signed between Azerbaijan and World Bank on September 5, 2008.\n\nWithin the project, reconstruction of water supply and sanitation systems and facilities in 21 regions of the country (Devechi, Dashkasan, Gadabay, Imishli, Kurdamir, Siyazan, Agsu, Ismayilli, Ujar, Zardab, Lankaran, Masalli, Astara, Jalilabad, Yardimli, Lerik and also in 5 districts of Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic - Julfa, Ordubad, Sadarak, Kangarli, Shahbuz) was planned.\n\nThe total cost of the project is $410.0 million. $260.0 million of this amount was financed by loans from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the International Development Association, and US$150.0 million was funded by the Government of Azerbaijan.\n\nSee also \n\n Utilities in Azerbaijan\n Jeyranbatan Ultrafiltration Water Treatment Plants Complex\n Jeyranbatan reservoir\nAzersu Open Joint Stock Company\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Groundwater of Azerbaidjan, Prof.Dr. Adishirin B.Alakbarov\n\nEconomy of Azerbaijan\nBodies of water of Azerbaijan", "machine_text": "Water supply and sanitation in Azerbaijan Water supply and sanitation in Azerbaijan is crucial for the country's development and wellbeing. Azerbaijan's water resources are abundant, but water access and quality vary greatly across regions, with some rural areas lacking access to clean drinking water and adequate sanitation services. Water supply Azerbaijan's water supply comes from two main sources: surface water and groundwater. The country has several rivers, including the Kura and Aras rivers, which provide most of the surface water for irrigation and municipal use. Azerbaijan also has a large number of lakes and reservoirs, including the Mingachevir reservoir, which is the largest man-made lake in the country. In urban areas, water supply is generally reliable and of good quality. Most cities and towns are served by public water supply systems. However, in rural areas, access to potable water is limited, and many people rely on surface water or shallow wells for drinking and cooking. Sanitation Sanitation in Azerbaijan is a major concern, particularly in rural areas. Many households do not have access to proper sanitation facilities, and open defecation is common. This has a negative impact on public health, as it can lead to the spread of waterborne diseases like cholera and typhoid fever. The government has implemented several programs to improve sanitation in rural areas, including the construction of latrines and access to safe drinking water. These efforts have had some success, but more work needs to be done to ensure that everyone in Azerbaijan has access to basic sanitation facilities. Water management Azerbaijan faces several challenges in water management, including overuse of water resources, pollution, and inefficient use of irrigation water. The government has implemented several initiatives to address these issues, including the development of water conservation and efficiency strategies and the construction of new water treatment plants. Conclusion Water supply and sanitation are crucial for the social and economic development of Azerbaijan. Efforts to improve water access and quality, sanitation facilities, and water management are essential for the country's future prosperity.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 56924005}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Linear alkylbenzene\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Linear alkylbenzenes (sometimes also known as LABs) are a family of organic compounds with the formula C6H5CnH2n+1. Typically, n lies between 10 and 16, although generally supplied as a tighter cut, such as C12-C15, C12-C13 and C10-C13, for detergent use.  The CnH2n+1 chain is unbranched. They are mainly produced as intermediate in the production of surfactants, for use in detergent.  Since the 1960s, LABs have emerged as the dominant precursor of biodegradable detergents.\n\nProduction\nHydrotreated kerosene is a typical feedstock for high purity linear paraffins (n-paraffins), which are subsequently dehydrogenated to linear olefins:\nCnH2n+2   \u2192   CnH2n  +  H2\nAlternatively, ethylene can be oligomerized (partially polymerized) to produce linear alkenes.  The resulting linear mono-olefins react with benzene in the presence of a catalyst to produce the LABs. Hydrogen fluoride (HF) and aluminium chloride (AlCl3) are the two major catalysts for the alkylation of benzene with linear mono-olefins. The HF-based process is commercially dominant; however, the risk of releasing HF (a poisonous substance) into the environment became a concern particularly after the Clean Air Act Amendment. In 1995, a solid catalyst system (the DETAL process) became available. The process eliminates catalyst neutralization and HF disposal. Consequently, most LAB plants built since then have utilized this process.\n\nProduction details\nGiven the large scale applications of LAB-derived detergents, a variety routes have been developed to produce linear alkylbenzenes:\n\nThe HF/n-paraffins process involving dehydrogenation of n-paraffins to olefins, and subsequent reaction with benzene using hydrogen fluoride as catalyst.  This process accounts for the majority of the installed LAB production in the world.  It includes a PACOL Stage where n-paraffins are converted to mono-olefins (typically internal mono-olefins), a DEFINE Unit whose primary function is to convert residual diolefins to mono-olefins, a PEP Unit which is essentially an aromatic removal unit - introduced before the alkylation step to improve LAB yield and quality, an alkylation step where mono-olefins, both internal and alpha olefins, are reacted with benzene to produce LAB in the presence of HF catalyst.\n The DETAL process involving dehydrogenation of n-paraffins to olefins, and subsequent reaction with benzene using a fixed bed catalyst.  This is newer technology and has several of the stages depicted in the HF/n-paraffins process, but it is principally different in the benzene alkylation step, during which a solid-state catalyst is employed.  There is a developing transalkylation (TA) stage to the Detal process wherein any higher alkylated benzenes (HAB) are contacted with additional benzene over a transalkylation catalyst.\n The Friedel-Crafts alkylation process involves chlorination of n-paraffins to monochloroparaffins followed by alkylation of benzene using aluminum chloride (AlCl3) catalyst. This method is one of the oldest commercial routes to LABs.\n\nEach process generates LAB products with distinct features.  Important product characteristics include the bromine index, sulfonatability, amount of 2-phenyl isomers (2-phenylalkane), the tetralin content, amount of non-alkylbenzene components, and the linearity of the product.\n\nThe production of n-paraffins often occurs as part of an integrated LAB plant where the producers start from kerosene as raw material. The UOP process for producing normal paraffin includes a kerosene prefractionation unit, a hydrotreating unit and a Molex unit.  The ExxonMobil Chemical technology includes a recovery process and can produce LAB grade n-paraffins from most medium to low sulfur kerosene without the use of a hydrotreater stage upstream.  A desulfurization process is needed to reduce the sulfur content of some n-paraffins\n\nApplications\nLinear alkylbenzene is sulfonated to produce linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS), a biodegradable surfactant. LAS replaced branched dodecylbenzene sulfonates, which were phased out because they biodegrade more slowly.\n\nNiche uses\nLAB was identified as a promising liquid scintillator by the SNO+ neutrino detector\ndue to its good optical transparency (\u224820 m), high light yield, low amount of radioactive impurities, and its high flash point (140\u00a0\u00b0C) which makes safe handling easier.  It is also available in large volumes at a relatively low cost at the SNO+ site. It is now used in several other neutrino detectors, such as the RENO and Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiments.\nThe material performs well in deep underwater environments.\nOne study suggested LAB as a suitable material to be employed in a Secret Neutrino Interactions Finder (SNIF), a type of antineutrino detector designed to detect the presence of nuclear reactors at distances of between 100 and 500\u00a0km.\n\nEnvironmental considerations\nLAB has been subject to concern about its effect on the environment and human health.  European Council Regulation (EC) 1488/94 led to it being extensively evaluated.  The life-cycle analysis considered the emissions and resulting environmental and human exposures. Following the exposure assessment, the environmental risk characterization for each protection target in the aquatic, terrestrial and soil compartment was determined.  For human health the scenarios for occupational exposure, consumer exposure and human exposure indirectly via the environment have been examined and the possible risks identified.\n\nThe report concludes that there are no concerns for the environment or human health.  There is no need for further testing or risk reduction measures beyond those currently practiced.  LAB was therefore de-classified and was removed from Annex 1 in the 28th ATP (Directive 2001/59).\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Material Safety Data Sheet\n\nAlkylbenzenes\nPhenyl compounds", "machine_text": "Linear alkylbenzene (LAB) is a chemical compound that consists of an aromatic ring attached to a linear chain of alkyl groups. It is widely used as a surfactant in household and industrial cleaning products, and as a starting material for the production of detergents. LAB is also used as a raw material in the synthesis of other chemicals, such as linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (LAS). Production LAB is produced by the reaction of benzene with olefins using a catalyst such as aluminum chloride (AlCl3). The most commonly used olefin for this purpose is linear alpha-olefins, which are obtained from the oligomerization of ethylene using specialized catalytic systems. The reaction between benzene and alpha-olefins produces a mixture of linear alkylbenzenes with various chain lengths. This mixture is then fractionated using distillation to isolate the desired chain length for use in various applications. Applications LAB is mainly used as a surfactant in detergents and cleaning products due to its excellent surfactant properties. It is preferred over other surfactants due to its high biodegradability and low toxicity. LAB is also used in the production of LAS, which is one of the most widely used anionic surfactants in the world. LAS is used in laundry detergents, dishwashing liquids, and other household and industrial cleaning products. LAB is also used in the production of other chemicals such as linear alkylbenzene sulfonic acid (LABSA), which is used as a raw material for the production of detergents, and alkylphenols, which are used in the production of plasticizers and detergents. LAB is also used as a solvent in the production of resins and pharmaceuticals. Environmental and Health Concerns LAB is generally considered safe for use in household and industrial cleaning products. However, continuous exposure to high doses of LAB can result in skin and eye irritation, and respiratory problems. LAB is also toxic to aquatic organisms and can cause harm to the environment if not properly disposed of. Conclusion Linear alkylbenzene is an important chemical that is widely used in the production of detergents and other cleaning products. It offers several advantages over other surfactants including high biodegradability and low toxicity. Despite its many advantages, it remains important to handle and dispose of linear alkylbenzene properly to avoid harm to the environment and potential health concerns.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 22761654}

The yellow-banded black wasp is known to have a particularly painful sting, which it uses to capture and subdue its prey. The wasp's primary hunting ground is on the ground, where it searches for spiders to lay its eggs. The wasp preys particularly on spiders belonging to the family Araneidae. The yellow-banded black wasp uses its powerful mandibles to capture and paralyze its prey before taking it to its nest to feed its young. Females of the species are known to dig burrows in the ground to create a nest where they can lay their eggs. The eggs are laid on a single spider, which provides the primary food source for the developing larvae. Cryptocheilus notatus has been observed hunting at different times of the day and is most active during the warmest parts of the day. These wasps are not aggressive towards humans and only sting in defense when they feel threatened. They are considered beneficial to humans as they help control the spider population.

It dealt with intelligence matters concerning British naval plans, and with the collection of naval intelligence in regard to coastal defences, foreign powers, mobilisation, trade and war.\n\nHistory\nThe Foreign Intelligence Committee was established in 1882 and it evolved into the Naval Intelligence Department in 1887.\n\nThe NID staff were originally responsible for fleet mobilisation and war plans as well as foreign intelligence collection; thus in the beginning there were originally two divisions: (1) intelligence (Foreign) and (2) Mobilisation. In 1900 another division, War, was added to deal with issues of strategy and defence, and in 1902 a fourth division, Trade, was created for matters related to the protection of merchant shipping. The Trade Division was abolished in October 1909 in the wake of the Committee of Imperial Defence inquiry into the feud between the First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir John Fisher and former Commander-in-Chief Channel Fleet, Admiral Lord Charles Beresford, when it was discovered that the captain heading the Trade Division had been supplying the latter with confidential information during the inquiry.\n\nIn 1910, the NID was shorn of its responsibility for war planning and strategy when the outgoing Fisher created the Navy War Council as a stop-gap remedy to criticisms emanating from the Beresford Inquiry that the Navy needed a naval staff\u2014a role the NID had been in fact fulfilling since at least 1900, if not earlier. After this reorganisation, war planning and strategic matters were transferred to the newly created Naval Mobilisation Department and the NID reverted to the position it held prior to 1887\u2014an intelligence collection and collation organisation.\n\nIn 1912 the department was restructured with most of its divisions and functions being absorbed within the Admiralty War Staff organisation the department was abolished and re-emerged as the Naval Intelligence Division of the new department.\n\nDirectors of Naval Intelligence\nDirectors of Naval Intelligence included:\n Captain William Henry Hall, 1887\u20131889\n Rear-Admiral Cyprian Bridge, 1889\u20131894\n Rear-Admiral Lewis Beaumont, 1895\u20131899\n Rear-Admiral Reginald Custance, 1899\u20131902\n Rear-Admiral Prince Louis of Battenberg, 1902\u20131905\n Captain Charles Ottley, 1905\u20131907\n Rear-Admiral Sir Edmond Slade, 1907\u20131909\n Rear-Admiral Alexander Bethell, 1909\u20131912\n\nAssistant directors\nIncluded:\nAssistant Director Mobilisation Division\n Captain Reginald N.

It is responsible for gathering and analyzing strategic, operational, and tactical information that may affect the country's naval interests and sharing that information with the appropriate authorities. The department has been in operation since the late 1800s and has played a crucial role in the country's naval history. History The Naval Intelligence Department had its origins during the late 1880s when the possibility of a war with Russia was being considered. Admiral Sir Arthur Wilson was appointed as the first Director of Naval Intelligence in 1887, and he worked to establish a network of agents around the world to provide information on foreign navies and their activities. During World War I, the NID played a critical role in protecting British shipping routes and thwarting enemy naval operations. In the interwar period, the department became more specialized, with dedicated sections for signals intelligence, code breaking, and naval planning. During World War II, the NID worked closely with the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park to intercept and decrypt German naval communications. The department also played a crucial role in planning and executing naval operations such as the Normandy landings and the sinking of the German battleship Bismarck. Structure The Naval Intelligence Department is overseen by the Director of Naval Intelligence, who reports directly to the Chief of the Naval Staff. The department is divided into several subsections, including: - Intelligence Collection: responsible for gathering information on foreign navies and their activities using a variety of sources. - Analysis and Assessment: responsible for analyzing the information collected by the department and providing assessments to the appropriate authorities. - Cryptography: responsible for maintaining the security of communications within the department and for breaking enemy codes and ciphers. - Planning and Operations: responsible for planning and executing naval operations in conjunction with other branches of the military. Conclusion The Naval Intelligence Department remains an essential element of the United Kingdom's defense structure. It provides valuable intelligence on foreign navies and their activities, assists in the planning and execution of naval operations, and contributes to the overall security of the country. The department's long history of service to the Royal Navy has played a vital role in ensuring the country's naval supremacy.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 53270045}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"NDUFAF5\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex assembly factor 5, also known as Arginine-hydroxylase NDUFAF5, or Putative methyltransferase NDUFAF5, is a protein that in humans is encoded by the NDUFAF5 gene. The NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex (complex I) of the mitochondrial respiratory chain catalyzes the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, and consists of at least 43 subunits. The complex is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. This gene encodes a mitochondrial protein that is associated with the matrix face of the mitochondrial inner membrane and is required for complex I assembly. A mutation in this gene results in mitochondrial complex I deficiency. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.\n\nStructure \nNDUFAF5 is located on the p arm of Chromosome 20 in position 12.1 and spans 36,554 base pairs. The NDUFAF5 gene produces a 30 kDa protein composed of 267 amino acids. The presumed structure of the c-terminal of the protein has been found to resemble that of the known secondary structure of RdmB. NDUFAF5 contains the S-adenosylmethionine dependent methyltransferase domain, which contains the GxGxG signature sequence, and the S-adenosylmethionine-binding motif which are common in most SAM-dependent methyltransferases. This arginine-hydroxylase is involved in the assembly of mitochondrial NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex (complex I, MT-ND1) at early stages. Complex I is composed of 45 evolutionally conserved core subunits, including both mitochondrial DNA and nuclear encoded subunits. One of its arms is embedded in the inner membrane of the mitochondria, and the other is embedded in the organelle. The two arms are arranged in an L-shaped manner. The total molecular weight of the complex is 1MDa.\n\nFunction \nThe NDUFAF5 gene encodes a mitochondrial protein that is associated with the matrix face of the mitochondrial inner membrane and is required for complex I assembly. Their role is integral to co-factor insertions and in utilizing sub-assemblies for building complex I. It does so by catalyzing the hydroxylation of Arg-73 in the NDUFS7 subunit of human complex I, which occurs before the peripheral and membrane arm juncture formation in the beginning stages of complex I assembly. The NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex (complex I) of the mitochondrial respiratory chain catalyzes the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, and consists of at least 43 subunits. The complex is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Though the exact biochemical function of NDUFAF5 is not yet known, mutations in this gene results in mitochondrial complex I deficiency. NDUFAF5 is also known to be a member of the 7\u03b2-strand family of SAM-dependent methyltransferases.\n\nClinical significance \nMutations in NDUFAF5 is known to result in mitochondrial diseases and associated disorders. It is majorly associated with a complex I deficiency, a deficiency in the first complex of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Suppression of the NDUFAF5 gene has been found to lead to the loss of both peripheral and membrane arms of complex I associated with NDUFS7 and ND1. This then leads to the progressive loss of complex I, causing the deficiency. Such disorders involving the dysfunction of the mitochondrial respiratory chain may cause a wide range of clinical manifestations from lethal neonatal disease to adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders. Phenotypes include macrocephaly with progressive leukodystrophy, non-specific encephalopathy, cardiomyopathy, myopathy, liver disease, Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, and some forms of Parkinson disease. Mutations in NDUFAF5 has also been common patients with Leigh syndrome, an early-onset progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the presence of focal, bilateral lesions.\n\nInteractions \nIn addition to co-subunits for complex I, NDUFAF5 has protein-protein interactions with NDUFAF8 (for stabilization), and NDUFS7.\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading \n\n \n \n \n \n\nHuman proteins\nGenes on human chromosome 20", "machine_text": "NDUFAF5 is a protein that is encoded by the NDUFAF5 gene. This gene is located on chromosome 9 and is believed to play a crucial role in the function of the complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Mitochondria are organelles that are responsible for the production of ATP, the energy currency of the cell. The respiratory chain is a series of protein complexes that are involved in energy production. NDUFAF5 is a subunit of complex I, which is the first complex in the respiratory chain. NDUFAF5 has been shown to be essential for the stability and activity of complex I. Studies have suggested that mutations in the NDUFAF5 gene can lead to complex I dysfunction and mitochondrial disorders. One specific disorder that has been linked to mutations in NDUFAF5 is Leigh syndrome, a progressive neurological disorder that is characterized by the degeneration of the central nervous system. NDUFAF5 is a highly conserved protein, meaning that it is similar across different species. This suggests that it plays an important role in the function of complex I in all organisms. Additionally, the expression of NDUFAF5 has been found to be regulated by several factors, including reactive oxygen species and hypoxia. Research into the function of NDUFAF5 is ongoing, and its potential as a therapeutic target for mitochondrial disorders is being explored. Understanding the role of NDUFAF5 in complex I function could lead to the development of new treatments for complex I dysfunction and mitochondrial disorders. In conclusion, NDUFAF5 is a crucial protein that plays a key role in the function of complex I in the mitochondrial respiratory chain.

He also was the publisher of B'nai Brith's newspaper, Jewish Tribune from 1985 until September 2014.\n\nDimant was the CEO of Christians United for Israel Canada from January 2015 until 2019. He  was, from 2015 until 2018, dean of the Modern Israel Studies Department at Canada Christian College and School of Graduate Theological Studies where he had been chair of the department since 2008. As of 2019, Dimant is no longer associated with the college. \n\nDimant was appointed national chairman of Likud Canada in June 2019.\n\nBackground\nOriginally from Montreal, Quebec, Dimant was educated at Yeshiva University and at McGill University's Graduate School of Sociology.

Dimant stated that the payout was approved by the organization's board, however, the Star cited an unnamed source as stating that the deal was arranged with little oversight while Dimant was still in charge. In the year following Dimant's retirement, B'nai Brith Canada put its \"state of the art\" care facility for Alzheimer's patients under insolvency protection while also trying to sell it. The project,  initiated and led by Dimant, was a $16 million facility opened in 2013 but that had been unable to attract enough patients, due to high fees for patients of $7,500 a month and the fact that it was not designed to be wheelchair accessible; the facility is losing $50,000 a month and owes $11 million to creditors.\n\nThe Toronto Star article also claimed that other issues left by Dimant's former management of B'nai Brith were a lack of records, failure to always issue charitable tax receipts and poor corporate governance, with approximately 50 people who had believed they were on various boards of B'nai Brith organizations learning that this was not the case, as Dimant's management had failed to file the correct paperwork with government agencies.\n\nReferences\n\nLiving people\nCanadian Orthodox Jews\nMcGill University alumni\nYeshiva University alumni\nJewish Canadian activists\nBusinesspeople from Montreal\nActivists from Montreal\nCanadian newspaper publishers (people)\nCanadian Zionists\nYear of birth missing (living people)", "machine_text": "Frank Dimant is a prominent Jewish Canadian leader and advocate.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"First Reading of the Emancipation Proclamation of President Lincoln\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "First Reading of the Emancipation Proclamation of President Lincoln is an 1864 oil-on-canvas painting by Francis Bicknell Carpenter. In the painting, Carpenter depicts Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States, and his Cabinet members reading over the Emancipation Proclamation, which proclaimed the freedom of slaves in the ten states rebelling against the Union in the American Civil War. Lincoln presented the Emancipation Proclamation to his Cabinet on July 22, 1862, and issued the Proclamation on September 22, 1862, which took effect on January 1, 1863.\n\nCarpenter spent six months in the White House while he painted. The painting is displayed at the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C.\n\nBackground\nCarpenter was deeply moved by Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, issued on January 1, 1863, calling it \"an act unparalleled for moral grandeur in the history of mankind.\" Carpenter felt \"an intense desire to do something expressive of... the great moral issue involved in the war.\"\n\nCarpenter, having formulated his idea for the subject of the painting and outlined its composition, met Frederick A. Lane, a friend who recently had earned a large amount of money. Lane agreed to bankroll Carpenter. By the influence of Samuel Sinclair of the New York Tribune and Representative Schuyler Colfax of Indiana, Carpenter gained Lincoln's assent to travel to Washington and work with him on the painting. Carpenter met with the President on February 6, 1864, who allowed him to live in the White House for four months, to work on the painting.\n\nCarpenter began with many sketches of Cabinet members and of Lincoln himself, working from life, as Lincoln worked, and from photographs taken by Mathew Brady of Lincoln and members of his Cabinet. Carpenter was given free access to Lincoln's White House office for the former purpose, and the State Dining Room was given him for a studio. On July 12, 1864, Lincoln led his cabinet into the State Dining Room to view the completed work.\n\nComposition\n\nThe setting of the painting is Lincoln's office, which also served as the Cabinet Room; it is now known as the Lincoln Bedroom. Lincoln indicated to Carpenter each person's position in the room on the day of the first reading. The artist had found the placement \"fortunately entirely consistent with my purpose.\" Carpenter intentionally avoided, as he wrote, \"imaginary curtain or column, gorgeous furniture or allegorical statue.\" Shown from left to right are Edwin M. Stanton, Secretary of War (seated); Salmon P. Chase, Secretary of the Treasury (standing); Lincoln; Gideon Welles, Secretary of the Navy (seated); Caleb Blood Smith, Secretary of the Interior (standing); William H. Seward, Secretary of State (seated); Montgomery Blair, United States Postmaster General (standing); and Edward Bates, United States Attorney General (seated). Portraits of Simon Cameron and Andrew Jackson adorn the wall behind them.\n\nCarpenter said, \"There were two elements in the Cabinet\u2013-the radical and the conservative. Mr. Lincoln was placed at the head of the official table, between two groups, nearest that representing the radical; but the uniting point of both. The chief powers of a government are War and Finance: the ministers of these were at his right\u2013-the Secretary of War, symbolizing the great struggle, in the immediate foreground; the Secretary of the Treasury, actively supporting the new policy, standing by the President\u2019s side.... To the Secretary of State, as the great expounder of the principles of the Republican party... would the attention of all at such a time be given.... The... chief officers of the government were thus brought in accordance with their relations to the administration, nearest the person of the President, who, with the manuscript proclamation in his hand, which he had just read, was represented leaning forward, listening to, and intently considering the views presented by the Secretary of State.\"\n\nThe map shown at the bottom right corner of the painting is a map made by the US Coast Survey in 1861 by using census data from 1860, and shows the relative prevalence of slavery in Southern counties that year.\n\nExhibition of and reception\nWhen Lincoln had the painting exhibited to the public in the East Room of the White House, Carpenter noted that the exhibition was thronged with visitors. An engraving of the painting was made by Alexander Hay Ritchie for mass reproduction. The painting was well received by critics, according to newspaper advertisements for those reproductions; also, many of the subjects in the painting commented favorably. The painting itself then toured the country.\n\nChase wrote a letter to Carpenter in 1866, remarking the composition of the work, noting that he and Stanton appear symbolically on Lincoln's right in the painting, having \"thoroughly endorsed and heartily welcomed the measure,\" and the cabinet members who had at first \"doubted, or advised delay, or even opposed\" the proclamation appear on Lincoln's left. [7]\n\nCarpenter later wrote a memoir of his experience painting the portrait, titled Six Months at the White House.\n\nPurchase and donation to Congress\nCarpenter campaigned for Congress to purchase the painting, enlisting the help of fellow Homer native William O. Stoddard, Lincoln's private secretary.  Congress did not appropriate the money.  The painting remained in Carpenter's possession until 1877, when he arranged for Elizabeth Thompson to purchase it for $25,000 and donate it to Congress.  A joint session of Congress was held in 1878, on Lincoln's birthday, to serve as a reception for the painting.  The artist was present at this event.\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nAmerican Civil War in art\nAbraham Lincoln in art\nHistory paintings\nPaintings in the United States Capitol\n1864 paintings", "machine_text": "The First Reading of the Emancipation Proclamation of President Lincoln was a historic event in American history. It marked a turning point in the Civil War, and it was a crucial step towards abolishing slavery in the United States. On September 22, 1862, President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared that all slaves in the Confederate states were to be set free. However, it was not until January 1, 1863, that the proclamation took effect. The first reading of the Emancipation Proclamation took place on September 24, 1862, in the Cabinet Room of the White House. President Lincoln read the proclamation to his cabinet members, and after they had reviewed it, he signed it. The proclamation had several important implications. First, it helped to turn the tide of the war in favor of the Union by giving the North a moral cause to fight for. Second, it paved the way for the eventual abolition of slavery in the United States. Third, it gave hope to millions of slaves who were still living in bondage. The First Reading of the Emancipation Proclamation was a pivotal moment in American history. It signaled a dramatic shift in the nation's moral and political landscape. While many challenges remained, the proclamation was a vital step towards creating a more just and equitable society for all Americans.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 34482845}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Dissolution of Czechoslovakia\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Dissolution of Czechoslovakia (, ) took effect on January 1, 1993, and was the self-determined split of the federal republic of Czechoslovakia into the independent countries of the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Both mirrored the Czech Socialist Republic and the Slovak Socialist Republic, which had been created in 1969 as the constituent states of the Czechoslovak Federal Republic.\n\nIt is sometimes known as the Velvet Divorce, a reference to the bloodless Velvet Revolution of 1989, which had led to the end of the rule of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia.\n\nBackground\n\nCzechoslovakia was created with the dissolution of Austria-Hungary at the end of World War I. In 1918, a meeting took place in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States, at which the future Czechoslovak President Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk and other Czech and Slovak representatives signed the Pittsburgh Agreement, which promised a common state consisting of two equal nations: Slovaks and Czechs. Soon afterward, he and Edvard Bene\u0161 violated the agreement by pushing for greater unity and a single nation.\n\nSome Slovaks were not in favour of that change, and in March 1939, with pressure from Adolf Hitler, the First Slovak Republic was created as a satellite state of Germany with limited sovereignty. The alignment with the Soviet Union after World War II oversaw the reunification into the Third Czechoslovak Republic.\n\nIn 1968, the Constitutional Law of Federation reinstated an official federal structure of the 1917 type, but during the Normalization Period in the 1970s, Gust\u00e1v Hus\u00e1k, despite being a Slovak himself, returned most of control to Prague. That approach encouraged a regrowth of separatism after the fall of communism.\n\nSeparation\n\nBy 1991, the Czech Republic's GDP per capita was some 20% higher than Slovakia's. Transfer payments from the Czech budget to Slovakia, which had been the rule in the past, were stopped in January 1991.\n\nMany Czechs and Slovaks desired the continued existence of a federal Czechoslovakia. Some major Slovak parties, however, advocated a looser form of coexistence and the Slovak National Party sought complete independence and sovereignty. For a few years, political parties re-emerged, but Czech parties had little or no presence in Slovakia and vice versa. To have a functioning state, the government demanded continued control from Prague, but Slovaks continued to ask for decentralisation.\n\nIn 1992, the Czech Republic elected V\u00e1clav Klaus and others, who demanded either an even tighter federation (\"viable federation\") or two independent states. Vladim\u00edr Me\u010diar and other leading Slovak politicians wanted a kind of confederation. Both sides opened frequent and intense negotiations in June. On July 17, the Slovak parliament adopted the declaration of independence of the Slovak nation. Six days later, Klaus and Me\u010diar agreed to dissolve Czechoslovakia at a meeting in Bratislava. Czechoslovak President V\u00e1clav Havel resigned, rather than oversee the dissolution, which he had opposed. In a September 1992 opinion poll, only 37% of Slovaks and 36% of Czechs favoured dissolution.\n\nThe goal of negotiations switched to achieving a peaceful division. Peaceful division was prioritized as the process ran in parallel with the violent breakup of Yugoslavia (another socialist, Slavic federal state created after the Dissolution of Austria-Hungary) such an outbreak in Czechoslovakia was undesired. On November 13, the Federal Assembly passed Constitution Act 541, which settled the division of property between the Czech lands and Slovakia. With Constitution Act 542, passed on November 25, they agreed to the dissolution of Czechoslovakia as of December 31, 1992.\n\nThe separation occurred without violence and so was thus said to be \"velvet\", much like the \"Velvet Revolution\", which had preceded it and had been accomplished by massive peaceful demonstrations and actions. In contrast, other post-communist breakups (such as the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia) involved violent conflict. Czechoslovakia is the only former Eastern bloc state that had an entirely-peaceful breakup. In the following years, as Slovakia's economy struggled, Slovaks began to describe the dissolution as a \"sandpaper divorce\".\n\nCauses\nA number of reasons have been given for the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, with the main debates focusing on whether dissolution was inevitable or whether dissolution occurred in conjunction with or even in contrast to the events that occurred between the Velvet Revolution of 1989 and the end of the joined state in 1992.\n\nThose who argue from the inevitability stance tend to point to the differences between the two nations, which date back to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and to other issues. There are ethnic differences between the Czechs and Slovaks, such as problems with the shared state during communism, the success of the state in the Czech lands and its failure in the Slovak lands that still resulted in the adoption of communism since the Czechs were more influential in the running of the state than Slovaks, and the 1968 constitution with its minority veto.\n\nThose who argue that events between 1989 and 1992 led to the dissolution point to international factors such as the breakaway of the Soviet satellite nations, the lack of unified media between Czechia and Slovakia, and most importantly the actions of the political leaders of both nations like the disagreements between Prime Ministers Klaus and Me\u010diar.\n\nLegal aspects\n\nNational symbols\nSince the coat of arms of Czechoslovakia was a composition of those of the historic geographic areas forming the country, each republic simply kept its own symbol: the Czechs the lion and the Slovaks the double cross. The same principle was applied to the two-part bilingual Czechoslovak national anthem that comprised two separate pieces of music, the Czech stanza Kde domov m\u016fj and the Slovak stanza Nad Tatrou sa bl\u00fdska. Disputes occurred only with respect to the Czechoslovak flag. During the 1992 negotiations on the details of dissolution of Czechoslovakia, as demanded by Vladim\u00edr Me\u010diar and V\u00e1clav Klaus, a clause forbidding the use of the state symbols of Czechoslovakia by its successor states was inserted into the constitutional law on the dissolution of Czechoslovakia.\n\nFrom 1990 to 1992, the red and white flag of Bohemia (differing from the Polish flag only by the proportion of the colours) officially served as the flag of the Czech Republic. Eventually, after a search for new symbols, the Czech Republic unilaterally decided to ignore the constitutional law on the dissolution of Czechoslovakia (Article 3 of Law 542/1992 stated that the \"Czech Republic and Slovak Republic shall not use the national symbols of the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic after its dissolution.\") and to keep the Czechoslovak flag, with an altered meaning. Slovakia, meanwhile, adopted its traditional flag; however, just before independence, on September 3, 1992, the coat of arms was added to prevent confusion with the similar flags of Russia and Slovenia.\n\nTerritory\nThe national territory was divided along the existing internal borders, but the border was not clearly defined at some points and, in some areas, the border cut across streets, access roads and communities that had coexisted for centuries. The most serious issues occurred around the following areas:\n\nU Sabot\u016f or \u0160ance (:cs:\u0160ance (Vrbovce)) \u2013 historically part of Moravia, awarded to Slovakia in 1997\nSidonie or Sid\u00f3nia (:cs:Sidonie) \u2013 historically part of Hungary (which contained all present-day Slovak territory until 1918), awarded to the Czech Republic in 1997\nKas\u00e1rna (:cs:Kas\u00e1rna (Makov)) recreational area \u2013 historically Moravian, disputed between Moravia and Hungary since the 16th century, formally part of Hungary since 1734; accessible by car only from the Czech side until early 2000s; remained in Slovakia despite heavy objections from the mostly-Czech property owners, whose real estate effectively fell into a foreign country.\n\nThe new countries were able to solve the difficulties via mutual negotiations, financial compensation and then an international treaty covering the border modifications.\n\nPeople living or owning property in the border area, however, continued to experience practical problems until both new countries entered the Schengen Agreement Area in 2007, rendering the border less significant.\n\nDivision of national property\nMost federal assets were divided in a ratio of two to one, the approximate ratio between the Czech and Slovak population in Czechoslovakia, including army equipment, rail and airliner infrastructure. Some minor disputes, such as gold reserves stored in Prague and federal know-how valuation, lasted for a few years after the dissolution.\n\nCurrency division\n\nInitially, the old Czechoslovak currency, the Czechoslovak koruna, remained in use by both countries. Czech fears of an economic loss caused the adoption of two national currencies as early as February 8, 1993. At the beginning, the currencies had an equal exchange rate, but the value of the Slovak koruna was then usually lower than that of the Czech koruna (in 2004, around 25\u201327% lower). On August 2, 1993, both currencies were distinguished by different stamps that were first affixed to and then printed on old Czechoslovak koruna banknotes.\n\nOn January 1, 2009, Slovakia adopted the euro as its currency with an exchange rate of 30.126 SK/\u20ac, and the \u20ac2 commemorative coin for 2009, Slovakia's first, featured the 20th anniversary of the Velvet Revolution in remembrance of the common struggle of the Czechoslovaks for democracy. By a quirk of fate, the welcoming speech on the behalf of the European Union on the occasion of Slovakia's entry to the eurozone was delivered by Mirek Topol\u00e1nek, the prime minister of the presiding country, the Czech Republic, naturally in his native language, but the other guest speakers used English. The Czech Republic continues to use the Czech koruna, or crown.\n\nInternational law\nNeither the Czech Republic nor Slovakia sought recognition as the sole successor state to Czechoslovakia. This can be contrasted to the Dissolution of the Soviet Union, when the Russian Federation was recognised as successor state to not only the Russian SFSR but also the Soviet Union itself. Therefore, Czechoslovakia's membership in the United Nations ceased upon the dissolution of the country, but on January 19, 1993, the Czech Republic and Slovakia were admitted as new, separate states.\n\nWith respect to other international treaties, the Czechs and the Slovaks agreed to honour the treaty obligations of Czechoslovakia. The Slovaks transmitted a letter to the Secretary General of the United Nations on May 19, 1993, to express their intent to remain a party to all treaties signed and ratified by Czechoslovakia and to ratify treaties signed but not ratified before dissolution of Czechoslovakia. The letter acknowledged that under international law, all treaties signed and ratified by Czechoslovakia would remain in force. For example, both countries are recognised as signatories of the Antarctic Treaty from the date that Czechoslovakia had signed the agreement in 1962.\n\nBoth countries have ratified the Vienna Convention on Succession of States in respect of Treaties, but it was not a factor in the dissolution of Czechoslovakia since it did not come into force until 1996.\n\nAftermath\n\nEconomy\n\nThe dissolution had some negative impact on the two economies, especially in 1993, as traditional links were severed to accommodate the bureaucracy of international trade, but the impact was considerably less than expected by many people.\n\nA customs union between the Czech Republic and Slovakia remained in place from the dissolution until May 1, 2004, when both countries entered the European Union.\n\nMany Czechs hoped that dissolution would quickly start an era of high economic growth in the Czech Republic, which no longer had to sponsor the \"less-developed Slovakia\". Similarly, others looked forward to an independent unexploited Slovakia that might become a new \"economic tiger\".\n\nAccording to The Prague Post, \"Slovak GDP reached 95 percent of the Czech GDP, and it is likely to draw level with it. The Slovak gross national product (GNP), which includes citizens' incomes abroad and deducts the money multinational companies move out of the country, is higher than the Czech one. Old-age pensions are more or less at the same level in both countries, and the consumption per capita is slightly higher in Slovakia. However, salaries are 10 percent lower on average in Slovakia than in the Czech Republic\".\n\nHowever, Martin Filko, the head of the Institute of Financial Policy of the Slovak Finance Ministry, pointed out that Slovakia is among the EU countries whose salaries form the lowest portion of their GDP. In other words, some of people's incomes come from sources other than their main employment, which reduces the real difference between the Czech and the Slovak salaries.\n\nSlovakia has higher political stability than the Czech Republic. As of 2018, Slovaks have had only four prime ministers since 1998, but the Czechs have had ten. Slovaks have become a more integral part of the EU because of their adoption of the euro and are more resolved to take part in the banking and fiscal unions. In the Czech Republic, the right wing opened the economy, and the left wing privatised banks and attracted foreign investors.\n\nUntil 2005, the GDP of the two countries was growing at a similar rate. However, from 2005 to 2008, the Slovak economy grew faster than the Czech economy. Economists agree that this growth was caused by the right-wing reforms of the Mikul\u00e1\u0161 Dzurinda government and the promise to adopt the euro, which attracted investors.\n\nWhen the left-wing populist Robert Fico replaced Dzurinda as Slovak prime minister after eight years in 2006, he reduced the right-wing reforms only moderately, but he did not abolish them, unlike the Czech Social Democrats (\u010cSSD).\n\nMeanwhile, the Czechs had three \u010cSSD prime ministers in four years (2002\u201306), followed by a shaky centre-right cabinet, which cut and simplified taxes but failed to push through other reforms and did not want to adopt the euro because of the financial crisis and the Civic Democrats' ideological stance.\n\nCitizenship\nSince federalisation in 1968, Czechoslovakia had divided citizenship, either of the Czech Socialist Republic or of the Slovak Socialist Republic, the word Socialist being dropped from both names shortly after the Velvet Revolution. That distinction, however, had little effect on citizens' life. On January 1, 1993, all Czechoslovak citizens automatically became citizens either of the Czech Republic or the Slovak Republic, based on their previous citizenship, permanent residence address, birthplace, family ties, job and other criteria. Additionally, people had one year's time to claim the other citizenship under certain conditions.\n\nSlovak legislation allowed dual citizenship until 2010, when it was abolished (see Citizenship Act (Slovakia)). Only a handful of people have exercised that right, but its significance is lessened by both nations' membership in the EU as the freedom of movement for workers, a policy that guarantees EU citizens the right to work and to live anywhere in the Union. In the case of movement between the Czech Republic and Slovakia, the policy took effect from 2004.\n\nBy contrast, the Czech Republic has prohibited dual citizenship for naturalized citizens and requires them to give up existing citizenship(s) prior to receiving citizenship of the Czech Republic. That requirement can be waived only if giving up an existing citizenship might put the applicant or their relatives in danger of persecution in their homeland, which was not the case of applicants from Slovakia. That situation changed with the new Citizenship Act of 2013 (186/2013 Sb.), in force since January 1, 2014. However, most Slovak citizens are still unable to become dual citizens of both the Czech Republic and Slovakia since they automatically lose Slovak citizenship upon voluntarily acquiring another one (see previous paragraph). Exempt from that law are only Slovak citizens who obtain a foreign citizenship by virtue of marriage with a foreign national. Some Slovak politicians have speculated in the media about softening the Citizenship Act, but no change has yet materialised as of January 2015.\n\nPeople of both countries were allowed to cross the border without a passport and were allowed to work anywhere without the need to obtain an official permit. Border checks were completely removed on December 21, 2007, when both countries joined the Schengen Agreement.\n\nUnder the current European regulations, citizens of either country are entitled to the diplomatic protection of any other EU country and so both have been considering merging their embassies, together with nations of the Visegr\u00e1d Group, to reduce costs.\n\nRoma people\nOne of the problems not solved during dissolution was the question of a large number of Romani living in the Czech Republic born and officially registered in today's Slovakia. Most of them did not re-register their official place of stay during the months before dissolution and so the question of their citizenship was left open. The 1992 Czech Nationality Act allowed a grant of automatic citizenship only to those who were born on Czech territory. For others, the right to citizenship required proof of a five-year period of residence, an \"unobjectionable\" criminal record, significant fees and a complicated bureaucratic process, which reportedly excluded a rather large percentage of Roma.\n\nThe Slovak government did not want to grant citizenship to nonresidents. Significant numbers of Roma living in Czech orphanages did not have their legal status clarified and were released from care as adult noncitizens without any right to work or live in the Czech Republic. Under pressure from the European Union, the Czech government made amendments to its nationality law in 1999 and 2003, which effectively solved the problem, but compensation has not been provided to those rendered stateless in 1992.\n\nLanguage contacts\n\nIn the former Czechoslovakia, the first television channel was a federal one and Czech and Slovak were languages that were used in equal ratios in the television news there, but foreign films and television series were almost exclusively dubbed into Czech, for example. That and the fact that the two languages are very similar made almost all people of both nations passively bilingual: they could understand but not necessarily speak the other language. After the dissolution in 1990s, the new television channels in the Czech Republic practically stopped using Slovak, and young Czech people now have a much lower understanding of Slovak. Also, the number of Slovak-language books and newspapers sold in the Czech Republic dropped drastically. The Czech television news, however, started to reintroduce Slovak-language coverage from Slovakia and Slovak television (STV2) rebroadcasts the Czech television newscast Ud\u00e1losti \u010cT daily, ten minutes after midnight.\n\nOn the public Radio and Television of Slovakia, it is common to have at least one daily newscast from the Czech Republic during prime time news. Furthermore, many programmes on Slovak television channels are still dubbed into Czech, some films in cinemas are subtitled in Czech and there are far more Czech-language books and periodicals on the market than there were before the dissolution. The major boost for the language interchange has come from private television channel providers like CS Link (Czech Republic) and Sky Link (Slovakia) that offer Slovak channels in the Czech Republic and vice versa. Additionally, several channels, regardless of their national origin, offer programs both in Czech and Slovak (CSFilm, TV Barrandov) or even mix like TV Nova's Nova Sport coverage of the English Premier League. New impulses to mutual contacts coming via television are also common shows like the Intelligence Test of Nations, Czechoslovakia's Got Talent, and Masked Singer broadcast by PRIMA and TV JOJ, and Czecho-Slovak SuperStar, the latter being the first international edition of the Pop Idol song contest broadcast by TV Nova and Mark\u00edza (both owned by CME), which also organized joint versions of MasterChef and The Voice in 2012. Also, the New Year's Eve Program for 2009 was prepared and broadcast jointly by \u010cT and STV and for 2010 by the Czech TV PRIMA and the Slovak TV JOJ, this time even including the singing of the Czechoslovak national anthem.\n\nYoung Slovak people still have the same knowledge of Czech as their predecessors, if not better. In Slovakia, Czech may still be used automatically in all judicial proceedings, and all documents written in Czech are acknowledged by Slovak authorities and vice versa. Further, the Slovak Official Language Act, passed in 2009, reconfirmed the right of Czechs to use their language in all official communication when dealing with Slovak authorities although it explicitly limited the use of Czech in Slovakia to persons with Czech as their mother tongue. The same is true about using the Slovak language in the Czech Republic because of the Administration Procedure Act of 2004. Gust\u00e1v Slame\u010dka, a Slovak citizen who was the Czech transport minister (2009\u20132010), used only Slovak exclusively during his official communication.\n\nSee also differences between Slovak and Czech languages.\n\nSport\nThe official breakup occurred right in the middle of the 1993 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, which took place in Sweden. The team representing Czechoslovakia was renamed \"Czech\u2013Slovak\" on January 1. In international ice hockey tournaments, the Czech Republic took over Czechoslovakia's place in the A-groups, and Slovakia had to start in the lower divisions.\n\nDuring the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1993 in Falun, Sweden, the ski jumping team competed as a combined Czech\u2013Slovakia team in the team large hill event and won silver. The team had been selected prior to the dissolution. Jaroslav Sakala won two medals in the individual hill events for the Czech Republic at those games along with his silver in the team event.\n\nIn their qualifying section for the 1994 FIFA World Cup, the Czechoslovakia national football team competed under the name RCS, which stood for \"Representation of Czechs and Slovaks\". It was afterward that it was officially split up into Czech and Slovak national teams. The team failed to qualify after it got only a draw in its final match against Belgium, a match that it needed to win to qualify.\n\nThe mutual encounters between the national teams of both countries in many sports are followed by most of the populations, and the number of players and coaches active in the other republic is significant. Martin Lipt\u00e1k, a Slovak handball coach, successfully led the Czech national team to the EHF 2010 Handball European Championship in Austria. A Slovak team under his coaching, Tatran Pre\u0161ov, won the Czech national league in 2008 and 2009. Czech ice hockey coach Vladim\u00edr V\u016fjtek led the Slovak national team to the silver medal at the 2012 IIHF World Championship, having beaten the Czech team in the semifinals.\n\nSeveral sports have featured a common league, and discussions about having a common football or ice hockey league continue.\n\nThe road cyclist J\u00e1n Svorada earned Slovak citizenship in 1993. In 1994, he became the first Slovak rider ever to win a Tour de France stage. Two years later, he earned Czech citizenship, and he became the first Czech rider ever to win another Tour de France stage in 1998.\n\nTelecommunications\nThe two successor states continued to use the country code +42 until February 1997, when it was replaced by two separate codes: +420 for the Czech Republic and +421 for Slovakia. Since then, telephone calls between both countries have required international dialing.\n\nLegacy\nPublic perception of the dissolution has not changed much, with a December 2017 poll showing that just 42% of Czechs and 40% of Slovaks agree with what happened (compared to 36% and 37% in 1992, respectively). According to the Czech political analyst Lubomir Kope\u010dek, many Czechs and Slovaks view the breakup process unfavourably because they had no say in the matter, and most would have rather had a referendum decide. In 2015, a Slovak movement called \"Czechoslovakia 2018\" was established to try to get a referendum by 2018. Its leader, Ladislav Zelinka, said that he had received thousands of emails and calls from supporters, but it was unable to reach the necessary 350,000 petition signatures. The younger generations of both countries are largely indifferent to the issue since they never experienced the previous period themselves, and older generations are more focused on present issues such as immigration and favour their own separate nationalism.\n\nSurveys from 2010 showed that the majority of the population of Prague (Czechs) still considers the division of the country a mistake; similarly, the general representative survey in Slovakia (from 2008) showed that society is still divided in opinion on the dissolution, with 47% favouring the dissolution and 44% considering it a mistake.\n\nPolitical influences between the countries are minimal, but social democrats tend to cooperate very closely on regional and European topics in recent years. Furthermore, it has become customary that the elected presidents pay their first and last official foreign visits during their term to the other republic of the former Czechoslovakia. Appointed foreign ministers tend to follow that unwritten rule. On October 29, 2012, to commemorate Czechoslovakia's declaration of independence, which occurred on October 28, 1918, the Czech and the Slovak governments held, for the first time, a joint cabinet meeting in the communities of Tren\u010d\u00edn and Uhersk\u00e9 Hradi\u0161t\u011b, near the common border.\n\nAlso, peacekeeping troops stationed in the former Yugoslavia were put under joint command on several occasions. For example, from 2002 to July 2005, the Czech Armed Forces joined with the Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic to form a joint Czech\u2013Slovak KFOR battalion in Kosovo, which contributed to the Multinational Brigade CENTRE. Trade relationships were re-established and stabilised, and the Czech Republic continues to be Slovakia's most important business partner. After a short interruption, Slovakia's resorts in the Carpathian mountains are again the destination of a growing number of Czech tourists.\n\nFollowing the death of the last Czechoslovak (and the first Czech) president, V\u00e1clav Havel, on December 18, 2011, both the Czech Republic and Slovakia observed a day of national mourning. During the funeral mass in Prague's St. Vitus Cathedral, prayers were recited in an equal ratio in the Czech and the Slovak languages.\n\nSee also\n Hyphen War\n Czech Republic\u2013Slovakia relations\n Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden (another example of a peaceful dissolution)\n\nReferences\n\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n Innes, Abby (2001), Czechoslovakia: The Short Goodbye (New Haven: Yale University Press).\n Rupnik, Jacques (2001), \"Divorce \u00e0 l\u2019amiable ou guerre de s\u00e9cession?

The process was a peaceful one, and it followed a series of negotiations between the two governments. The decision to dissolve Czechoslovakia was the result of political changes in both countries, including the end of the Cold War and the collapse of communism. Czechoslovakia was established in 1918, following the end of World War I, and it remained a single state until the early 1990s. The country was a federal state, with two distinct nations\u2014the Czechs and the Slovaks\u2014sharing a government. However, tensions had been brewing between the two nations for some time. The Slovaks believed that they were being given less political power than the Czechs, and they felt that their national identity was being suppressed. In 1989, Czechoslovakia experienced a peaceful revolution that ended communist rule. The country\u2019s first democratic elections were held in 1990, and they brought to power a coalition government that included parties representing both the Czechs and the Slovaks. However, the coalition was short-lived, and the country was soon faced with the prospect of dissolution. In the years leading up to the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, negotiations were held between the two governments to work out the details of the split. In the end, it was decided that the country would be divided into two independent states: the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The partition was a peaceful one, with no violence or bloodshed. Since its dissolution, both countries have developed their own distinct identities, and relations between the two nations have been amicable. The Czech Republic and Slovakia are now two independent, democratic states, and both are members of the European Union and NATO.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 873028}

From an early age he was attracted to painting.\n\nHis uncle, the sculptor Jules Printemps, a student of Fran\u00e7ois Jouffroy at the \u00c9cole nationale des Beaux-Arts, supported his vocation and prepared him for the entrance examination to this school. He was admitted in 1892, joined the workshop of Gustave Moreau and regularly visited it until Moreau\u2019s death in 1898. He also associated with such artists as  Rouault, Matisse, Evenepoel, Albert Marquet, Edgar Maxence and Charles Milcendeau.\n\nAround this period his work was largely part of the Symbolist movement and he experimented with a poetic or mythological vision and with the sensuality of the female nude.\n\nWork\n\nPortrait painter \nHe soon established his reputation as a portrait artist receiving commissions from such eminent personalities as Sully Prudhomme, the first recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature, the Prince and Princess of Waldeck, Mr and Mrs Commettant, and Prince Yusupov, the assassin of Rasputin.\n\nL\u00e9on Printemps married in 1903 and frequently painted his family in an intimate tone, particularly his daughter Lucile whose death at the age of 6 touched him profoundly, as well as his son Ren\u00e9.\n\nLandscape painter \nL\u00e9on Printemps was a landscape painter his entire life. His desire to meet Flemish masters prompted him to travel to Belgium and the Netherlands at the end of the nineteenth century, returning home with various studies. \nLater in life his attraction to the beaches of Normandy, which were quite fashionable at the time, became more marked. After the First World War he started painting landscapes in Brittany and particularly the islands of the Vend\u00e9e coast, the island of Noirmoutier, the island of Yeu, where he painted seascapes and portraits of fishermen and old farmers\u2019 wives.\n\nFlemish and Dutch influence \nThe appeal of the work of Flemish and Dutch masters during Printemps\u2019 visits to the Louvre Museum inspired him to travel to Belgium and the Netherlands on several occasions with a desire to better understand the art of these great Flemish and Dutch masters. Several paintings, which were the outcome of his first visits to Belgium, were presented at the Salon des artistes fran\u00e7ais (1898 and 1905), the Salon artistique des PTT (1905) and in regional exhibitions, in Lille (1898) and in Nantes (1906).\n\nIn 1894 Printemps travelled to Belgium for the first time, presumably in the company of other students of Gustave Moreau, visiting Bruges, Ghent, Mechelen and Antwerp. Two years later he travelled to the Meuse Valley where he painted the Bayard Rock, a remarkable sight in Dinant. In 1897, he spent some time in the Netherlands visiting the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. In 1898, he returned to Bruges and Mechelen. In 1929 and 1933 he also took his son Ren\u00e9, who was also studying to become a painter at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, on a trip to explore these two cities.\n\nL\u00e9on Printemps died on 9 July 1945, in his studio at 6 rue Furstenberg, where the Mus\u00e9e National Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix is currently located.\n\nGallery\n\nParticipation in Exhibitions \u2013 Awards and Merits \n Salon des artistes fran\u00e7ais, between 1893 and 1939.

Born in Paris in 1848, he was a lawyer by profession and became involved in politics during the Third Republic. Printemps was first elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1898 as a member of the Radical Party. He quickly established himself as a vocal advocate for social justice and reform, particularly in the areas of education, labor rights, and public health. Printemps was one of the leading voices pushing for the creation of a national healthcare system in France, which eventually became a reality in the form of the National Health Insurance scheme in 1945. During World War I, Printemps was a member of the French parliament\u2019s Commission for Foreign Affairs and was responsible for negotiating with the United States government. He played a key role in convincing U.S. President Woodrow Wilson to enter the war on the side of the Allies. After the war, Printemps continued to be an influential figure in French politics, using his platform to fight for the rights of workers and the poor. He was a passionate believer in the power of the state to effect positive change in society, and his policies helped lay the groundwork for France\u2019s post-war social welfare system. Printemps passed away in 1935 at the age of 87. He remains a revered figure in French political history, remembered as a tireless advocate for social justice and reform. His legacy endures in the form of his contributions to the development of France\u2019s modern welfare state.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 34871387}

Over the course of his eight-year playing career in Major League Baseball (MLB), Scheuler played for the Atlanta Braves, Philadelphia Phillies, Minnesota Twins, and Chicago White Sox.\n\nSchueler graduated from Hays High School, where he played baseball and basketball, then went on to attend Fort Hays State University, before first being drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates (but did not sign), in the 1966 Major League Baseball Draft; he was then selected by the Braves (and signed), in the 1967 Major League Baseball Draft. From  to , Schueler's White Sox teams had regular season win-loss totals of 817\u2013729, while winning two division championships, with a 2\u20137 record in two postseason appearances.\n\nMinor leagues\nSchueler was selected in the twelfth round of the 1966 Major League Baseball Draft by the Pittsburgh Pirates, but never signed a contract to play with the team.

On September 7, , only twenty-two years old, Schueler tossed a no-hitter for Double-A Shreveport.\n\nMajor leagues\nSchueler was called up at the start of the  season at twenty-three years old. On April 16, 1972, two days before his twenty-fourth birthday, Schueler made his major league debut as a reliever in a game against the San Diego Padres at San Diego Stadium. He pitched two innings and only gave up one hit in that game, but despite his efforts, the Braves lost. Schueler went on to start thirty-eight games over two years with the Braves.\n\nAfter the  season ended, Schueler was dealt to the Philadelphia Phillies for infielder Craig Robinson and pitcher Barry Lersch. After a mediocre season as a starter, the Phillies converted Schueler to a relief pitcher.

Beef galbi is sometimes referred to as \"gari\" (\uac00\ub9ac), so the dish can be called \"garijjim\". Galbijjim is generally made with beef or pork (\ub3fc\uc9c0, dweji) short ribs. In the latter case, it is called dweji galbijjim (\ub3fc\uc9c0\uac08\ube44\ucc1c).\n\nHistory\nIn traditional cuisine, galbijjim was traditionally eaten at Chuseok along with songpyeon, namul, taro soup, chestnut dumplings (\ubc24\ub2e8\uc790), chicken jjim and autumn fruit. As galbijjim is usually made from only the center part of ribs from a calf while the rib ends used to make soup stock, galbi was more expensive than other cuts of beef in South Korea, and has been regarded as a high-class dish.\n\nPreparation and serving\nRibs are cut to size and excess blood should be removed. Knife cuts are made in the meat till the bone to allow seasoning to seep in. Surplus fat is removed from the ribs, either by cutting or removing after parboiling. Soy sauce, sesame oil, scallions, minced garlic, pepper, ground sesame with salt (\uae68\uc18c\uae08), ginger juice, and sugar are mixed together with the ribs and are simmered in a large pot on a mid-flame. The cooking is done slowly, occasionally stirring. When the meat is almost cooked, additional seasoning is added with jujube,  ginkgo nuts, carrots, and pine nuts, and is boiled once again. Chestnuts, shiitake, and seogi mushrooms are added near the end of the dish.\nGalbijjim is usually served in a bowl rather than a plate and was traditionally served in a hap (\ud569, bowl with cover).\n\nGalbijjim by region\nThere is a galbijjim street in the district of Dongin-dong, Daegu, in South Korea. It is known as the original home of hot and spicy galbijjim (\ub9e4\uc6b4\uac08\ube44\ucc1c), as a restaurant owner served the first plate of hot and spicy galbijjim as anju for makgeolli in 1972. The district still maintains its reputation as being the place to go for tasty galbijjim. \n\nJong-galbijjim (\uc885\uac08\ube44\ucc1c) is a variety of pork galbijjim from the Gyeonggi-do region.

The ribs are braised in a flavorful mixture of soy sauce, garlic, ginger, and other seasonings until they are tender and fall off the bone. Galbi-jjim is often served as a main dish for family gatherings and special occasions. The word \"galbi\" translates to \"ribs\" in Korean, and \"jjim\" means \"steamed\" or \"braised\". The dish is believed to have originated from the royal court cuisine of the Joseon dynasty in the late 14th century. It was originally served as a dish for the royal family and high-ranking officials. Today, galbi-jjim is enjoyed by people from all walks of life in Korea and around the world. The key to making delicious galbi-jjim is in the preparation of the meat. The short ribs are usually cut across the bone into thin slices, about 1 centimeter thick. They are then marinated overnight in a mixture of soy sauce, sugar, sesame oil, garlic, ginger, and other seasonings. This allows the flavors to penetrate the meat and makes it more tender. To cook, the ribs are placed in a pot along with the marinade and other ingredients such as potatoes, carrots, and onions. The pot is then simmered on low heat for several hours until the meat is tender and the sauce has thickened. The result is a rich, savory dish with a sweet and salty flavor profile. Galbi-jjim is typically served with rice and other side dishes such as kimchi, pickled vegetables, and bean sprouts. It is a popular dish in Korean restaurants and is also a favorite of Korean home cooks. Its popularity has spread around the world, and it can now be found on the menus of Korean restaurants in many countries. In addition to its delicious taste, galbi-jjim is also considered to be a nutritious dish. Beef short ribs are a good source of protein, iron, and other essential nutrients. The vegetables in the dish provide vitamins and fiber, making it a well-rounded meal. Overall, galbi-jjim is a delicious and satisfying dish with a rich history and cultural significance in Korea.

The film stars Jim Carrey as Bruce Nolan, a down-on-his-luck television reporter who complains to God (played by Morgan Freeman) that he is not doing his job correctly and is offered the chance to try being God himself for one week. The film is Shadyac and Carrey's third collaboration, as they had worked together previously on Ace Ventura: Pet Detective in 1994 and Liar Liar in 1997. It co-stars Jennifer Aniston, Philip Baker Hall and Steve Carell.\n\nWhen released in American theaters on May 23, 2003, Bruce Almighty opened to mixed reviews from critics, but was a box-office success and grossed $85.9 million, making it the top Memorial Day opening weekend of any film in history at the time. The film surprised film pundits when it beat The Matrix Reloaded the following weekend. By the end of its theatrical run, the film had made $242 million domestically and a total $484 million worldwide, making it Carrey's highest-grossing film worldwide, as well as the fifth-highest-grossing film of 2003.\n\nEvan Almighty, a spin-off sequel focusing on Steve Carell's character, with Shadyac and Oedekerk returning to direct and write, and Freeman also reprising his role, was released on June 22, 2007.\n\nPlot\n\nBruce Nolan is a television field reporter for Eyewitness News on WKBW-TV in Buffalo, New York, but desires to be the news anchorman. When Bruce is passed over for promotion by his rival, Evan Baxter, he becomes furious and vents on live T.V.; his actions lead to him being fired from the station. Following a series of misfortunes, Bruce takes his anger out on God and complains that \"He's the one that should be fired\".\n\nBruce receives a message on his pager, which takes him to an empty warehouse where he meets God. God offers to give Bruce His powers to prove that He is doing the job correctly. God only gives Bruce two rules: he cannot tell others he has God's powers, nor can he use the powers to alter free will. Bruce is initially jubilant with the powers, using them for personal gain, such as exposing a woman's panties, getting his job back, and impressing his girlfriend, Grace Connelly. Bruce finds ways of using his powers around Buffalo to cause miraculous events to occur at otherwise mundane events that he covers, such as discovering Jimmy Hoffa's body or causing a meteor to harmlessly land near a cook-off, earning him the name \"Mr. Exclusive\". Bruce then causes Evan to embarrass himself on-air, causing Evan to be fired in favor of Bruce as the new anchor. During this, Bruce continues to hear voices in his head. He later re-encounters God, who explains that the voices are prayers, meant for God, that Bruce must deal with. Bruce creates a computerized email-like system to receive the prayers and respond but finds that the influx is far too many for him to handle\u2014even though God has stated that Bruce is only receiving prayers from a section of the Buffalo area\u2014and sets the program to answer every prayer Yes automatically.\n\nBruce attends a party celebrating his promotion. When Grace arrives, she finds Bruce kissing his co-anchor, Susan Ortega, after she forcefully comes on to him, and quickly leaves. Bruce follows her, trying to use his powers to convince her to stay but cannot influence her free will. As Bruce looks around, he realizes that Buffalo has fallen into chaos due to his actions: parts of the city believe the Apocalypse is nearly upon Earth due to the meteor strikes, while a large number of people, all having prayed to win the multi-million dollar lottery and finding they all won reducing their prize to a few dollars, have started rioting in the streets. Bruce returns to God, who explains that He cannot solve all the problems and Bruce must figure out a way himself. Bruce then goes about helping people without using his powers, including giving Evan his job back. As Bruce reads through the prayers on his computer, he finds several from Grace, wishing for his success and well-being. As Bruce reads it, another prayer from Grace arrives, this one wishing to not be in love with him anymore.\n\nBruce is stunned and walks alone on a highway. Heartbroken, he asks God to take back His powers and letting his fate be in His hands. Bruce is suddenly hit by a truck and regains his consciousness in a white void. God appears, and He asks Bruce what he really wants; Bruce admits that he only wants to make sure Grace finds a man that would make her happy. God agrees and brings Bruce back to life. Bruce wakes up and finds himself in the hospital. Grace arrives shortly after. She and Bruce rekindle their relationship, and later become engaged. Following his recovery, Bruce returns to field reporting, and continues to report offbeat news stories.\n\nCast\n\n Jim Carrey as Bruce Nolan\n Morgan Freeman as God\n Jennifer Aniston as Grace Connelly, Bruce's girlfriend\n Catherine Bell as Susan Ortega, Bruce's co-anchor\n Steve Carell as Evan Baxter (credited as Steven Carell), Bruce's rival\n Philip Baker Hall as Jack Baylor\n Lisa Ann Walter as Debbie Connelly, Grace's sister\n Paul Satterfield as Dallas Coleman\n Nora Dunn as Ally Loman\n Eddie Jemison as Bobby\n Sally Kirkland as Anita Mann\n Micah Stephen Williams as boy on bike\n Tony Bennett as himself\n Carlos S\u00e1nchez as Juan Valdez\n John Murphy as himself\n Madeline Lovejoy as Zoe\n Noel Gugliemi as Hector\n\nProduction\n\nFilming of Buffalo was done in the \"New York Street\" at Universal Studios Hollywood. The restaurant with Tony Bennett was filmed at Cicada, in the James Oviatt Building, downtown Los Angeles. The spa scene with Jennifer Aniston was filmed in the Shoin building at The Japanese Garden in Los Angeles.\n\nReception\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a score of 48% based on 193 reviews, with an average rating of 5.70/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Carrey is hilarious in the slapstick scenes, but Bruce Almighty gets bogged down in treacle.\" On Metacritic, it has a score of 46 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews.\"\n\nRoger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three out of four stars, calling it: \"A charmer, the kind of movie where Bruce learns that while he may not ever make a very good God, the experience may indeed make him a better television newsman.\" Ebert praised Aniston's performance: \"Aniston, as a sweet kindergarten teacher and fiancee, shows again (after \"The Good Girl\") that she really will have a movie career.\"\n\nVarietys Robert Koehler gave the film a mixed review: \"There's remarkably little done with a premise snatched from high-concept heaven, adding yet another file to the growing cabinet of under-realized comedies.\"\n\nThe film was released in the United Kingdom on June 27, 2003, and topped the country's box office that weekend.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times gave it a negative review and called it \"not so mighty.\"\n\nControversies\nThe film was banned in Egypt because of its portrayal of God as an ordinary man. Bans in both Malaysia and Egypt were eventually lifted after the nations' censorship boards gave the film their highest rating (18-PL in the case of Malaysia).\n\nAs God contacts Bruce using an actual phone number rather than one in the standard fictional 555 telephone exchange, several people and groups sharing this number received hundreds of phone calls from people wanting to talk to God, including a church in North Carolina, US (where the minister was named Bruce), a pastor in northern Wisconsin and a man running a sandwich shop in Manchester, England. The producers noted that the number (776-2323) was not in use in the area code (716, which was never specified on screen) in the film's story, but did not check anywhere else. For the home-video and television versions of the film, the number was changed to the fictional 555\u20130123.\n\nSequel\nA sequel and spin-off, titled Evan Almighty, was released on June 22, 2007, with Steve Carell reprising his role as Evan Baxter and Morgan Freeman returning to his role as God. Although Shadyac returned to direct the sequel, neither Carrey nor Aniston was involved with the film, and Carrey's character, Bruce, is never mentioned in the film. The film was a critical and commercial failure.\n\nAccolades\n\nSoundtrack\n\nThe soundtrack was released on June 3, 2003, by Var\u00e8se Sarabande.

The movie follows Bruce Nolan, a discontented TV reporter who is given divine powers to help him realize the importance of his life. The film was a commercial success, grossing over $484 million on a $81 million budget, and received generally positive reviews from critics. The film begins with Bruce Nolan, a television reporter from Buffalo, New York, who is increasingly frustrated with his life and career. He blames God for his misfortunes and challenges Him to an argument. God accepts Bruce's challenge and appears before him in the form of an old janitor, played by Morgan Freeman. God gives Bruce divine powers to see if he is up to the task of running the world for a while. With his newfound powers, Bruce sets about using them for his own selfish purposes, such as manipulating his career, changing the weather, and getting revenge on his adversaries. However, he ultimately learns that being God is not as easy as he thought, and that with great power comes great responsibility. Bruce Almighty was praised for its humor, performances, and theme of personal growth, with many calling it a classic Jim Carrey film. It was also noted for its use of special effects to depict God's powers, which were both impressive and humorous. The film received criticism for its use of religious themes, with some finding it inappropriate or offensive. Overall, Bruce Almighty is a fun and uplifting film that encourages viewers to appreciate their lives and the people around them. Its message of personal responsibility and growth resonate with audiences and make it a popular and memorable film.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 237303}

Gabriel. The book claims that Gabriel was a childhood friend of Jesus of Nazareth and offers a unique perspective on the life of the Son of God that differs significantly from the traditional accounts presented in the Bible. Gabriel's book is largely considered a work of fiction by scholars and religious authorities, though it has gained a small following of supporters who are drawn to its unconventional narrative. According to the book, Gabriel and Jesus grew up together in Nazareth and were close friends until Gabriel moved away to pursue his own interests. Gabriel claims that he reunited with Jesus later in life, after Jesus had become a powerful religious figure, only to discover that his old friend had changed significantly and had lost touch with his humble beginnings. Critics of I Knew Jesus (Before He Was a Star) argue that Gabriel's account of Jesus' life is not based on any reliable historical sources and that it is unlikely that Jesus and Gabriel knew each other at all. Additionally, some argue that the book's portrayal of Jesus as a lost and disillusioned figure is at odds with the gospel accounts, which depict him as a profound and purposeful leader. Despite the controversy surrounding I Knew Jesus (Before He Was a Star), the book has gained a cult following among those interested in alternative interpretations of religious history. Whether or not Gabriel's claims are true remains a subject of debate, but his book offers a fascinating and thought-provoking look at the life of one of history's most influential figures.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 19234121}

Amolops archotaphus itself was \"hidden\" as a cryptic species within the \"Odorrana livida complex\" until 1997, and was reassigned to Amolops in 2008.\n\nAmolops archotaphus is known from near small waterfalls at elevations of  above sea level. It is threatened by habitat destruction and degradation, particularly agriculture, development of infrastructure, logging and water pollution.

It is found in southwestern China and northern Myanmar. The species was first described by Fei, Ye, and Li in 2001, based on specimens collected from the Gaoligong Mountains of Yunnan province, China. The Yunnan toothed toad is a small species, with adult males typically reaching a snout-vent length of 42.3\u201347.5 mm, and adult females measuring 48.5\u201350.5 mm. The species has a sturdy build and a distinctively toothed lower lip. Its dorsal coloration is primarily brown, with a darker brown or black pattern and small yellow spots on its back. The toad also has a pale yellow or cream ventral surface. The Yunnan toothed toad is largely aquatic, spending much of its time in shallow streams and pools. It is a nocturnal species, feeding on insects and other small invertebrates. Breeding occurs during the rainy season, and females lay clutches of several dozen eggs on vegetation overhanging the water. Tadpoles develop in the water, and complete metamorphosis into adult toads in around four to six months. The Yunnan toothed toad is currently classified as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). While it is believed to have a relatively limited distribution, with populations potentially threatened by habitat loss and degradation, it is still considered common in many areas of its range. The Yunnan toothed toad is also notable for its contribution to the study of amphibian evolutionary biology. Its discovery and description provided important insights into the phylogenetic relationships between different species and genera of frogs, particularly in the closely related genus Amolops.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 12408768}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Create NSW\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Create NSW is a government agency of the Government of New South Wales, that falls within the Enterprise, Investment and Trade cluster. The agency was created on 1 April 2017 from an amalgamation of Arts NSW (ANSW) and Screen NSW. Create NSW is responsible for administering government policies that support the arts, artists and the various cultural bodies within the state of New South Wales in Australia, and for the provision of funding. It also provides secretarial and administrative support to the Arts & Culture Advisory Committee, a high-level committee which works with the government to help shape policy and promote the arts throughout the state.\n\n, the executive team is headed by Kate Foy (Deputy Secretary, Community Engagement), Chris Keely (Executive Director, Create NSW) and Grainne Brunsdon (Head of Screen NSW). The agency advises the Minister for the Arts, currently The Hon. Ben Franklin . Ultimately, the Minister is responsible to the Parliament of New South Wales.\n\nHistory\n\nArts minister role\nThe role of an \"arts\" minister, overseeing the management and support for all cultural activities in New South Wales, before the early 1970s was an unheard of concept in politics. However, by the early 1970s, various governments in Australia recognised the need for a steering authority for state support for the arts. In response, premier Bob Askin appointed George Freudenstein as the first Minister for Cultural Activities on 11 March 1971. On his appointment Freudenstein requested the establishment of an organisation to enable him to carry out his responsibilities and the Premier agreed. On 13 May 1971 the Ministry of Cultural Activities was established, taking over responsibility for various legislation and bodies that had previously been under the purview of the Department of Education, including the Archives Office of New South Wales, Art Gallery of New South Wales, State Library of New South Wales, Australian Museum, Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences, Sydney Observatory, the Advisory Committee on Cultural Grants, NSW Film Council, and the Sydney Opera House Trust. In the case of the opera house, the Ministry had responsibility for its completion and final official opening on 20 October 1973.\n\nWith Freudenstein's departure on 3 January 1975, a new Minister for Culture, Sport and Recreation was appointed and on 6 January 1975, the Ministry of Cultural Activities was replaced by the new Department of Culture, Sport and Recreation. This arrangement lasted until 14 May 1976 when the new Labor Government of Neville Wran transferred the responsibility for cultural activities to the Premier's Department. This became the Cultural Activities Division under the administration of the Premier himself. This situation continued until 1984, when Wran established the Office of the Minister for the Arts within the Premier's Department and commissioned himself with the title of Minister for the Arts.\n\nOn 15 June 1988 a Ministry for the Arts independent of the Premier's Department was established.\n\n2006: Arts NSW created\nThis Ministry for the Arts was abolished on 3 March 2006 and its responsibilities were moved to the new Department of the Arts, Sport and Recreation.  Arts NSW became the new dedicated division for the Minister, and it transferred to \"Communities NSW\" in July 2009 and then the Department of Trade and Investment, Regional Infrastructure and Services from 4 April 2011. From the appointment of Troy Grant as the Minister in 2014, Arts NSW fell within the Department of Justice.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2020, the organisation was shuffled through four departments.\n\n2017: Create NSW\nCreate NSW was created via an amalgamation of Arts NSW and Screen NSW on 1 April 2017. The Screen NSW banner was removed, CEO Courtney Gibson left the role, and Michael Brealey, then acting executive director of Arts NSW, became CEO of the new agency. In April 2017, an arm of Create NSW was established (Create Infrastructure) dedicated to the planning and delivery of cultural infrastructure.\n\nThe agency fell within the Arts, Screen and Culture Division of the Department of Planning and Environment (abolished on 1 July 2019) at the time of the publication of its 2018 Cultural Infrastructure Plan 2025+. As a result of a government restructure in April 2019 after a state election, Create NSW was moved to the Minister for the Public Service and Employee Relations, Aboriginal Affairs, and the Arts, then held by Don Harwin and administered through the Community Engagement portfolio of the Department of Premier and Cabinet headed by Deputy Secretary, Community Engagement, Clare Foy.\n\nOn 28 June 2019, Harwin announced a revamp to the process of application, assessment and delivery of NSW arts funding. The main differences, largely driven by the findings of the 2018 NSW Arts Summit, Arts 2025, were:\na streamlined approach that consolidated the existing 14 funding rounds into two annual calls for funding;\na reduction in the assessment criteria for funding applications from 26 to 3; and\nreplacement of the cross-sector peer review panels by ten new \"Artform Assessment Boards\".\nIn addition, the requirement that an organisation had to receive project funding for three consecutive years in order to qualify for annual funding was dropped.\n\nIn September 2019, a restructuring of the leadership team of Create NSW led to the resurrection of the Screen NSW brand, and Grainne Brunsdon appointed head of that team, which remains part of Create NSW.\n\nStructure, role and activities\n\nRole and organisational structure\nCreate NSW is \"the NSW Government\u2019s arts, screen and culture development, policy and infrastructure planning and delivery body\". Between 2019 and 2021 the agency was responsible to the Minister for the Public Service and Employee Relations, Aboriginal Affairs, and the Arts and was administered through the Department of Premier and Cabinet. It was one of five branches of the Community Engagement Group within the department. In a rearrangement of the Perrottet ministry, Create NSW was transferred to the newly established Enterprise, Investment and Trade cluster and a Minister for the Arts established to guide the agency's direction.\n\nIt also provides secretarial and administrative support to the Arts & Culture Advisory Committee, a high-level committee which works with the government to help shape policy and promote the arts throughout the state.\n\n, the executive team is headed by Kate Foy (Deputy Secretary, Community Engagement), Chris Keely (Executive Director, Create NSW) and Grainne Brunsdon (Head of Screen NSW), along with seven other members of the team.\n\nAlso under the arts portfolio are statutory authorities of the Sydney Opera House, Australian Museum, Art Gallery of NSW, State Library of NSW, Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences (MAAS), and Sydney Living Museums and the State Archives and Records Authority (SARA, aka NSW State Archives and Records), but these are separate from Create NSW.\n\nInfrastructure and properties\n, Create NSW's infrastructure redevelopment projects included: Theatre Royal, the Australian Museum, Riverside Theatres, the new Powerhouse Museum, Sydney Opera House renewal, expansion of the Art Gallery of NSW (\"Sydney Modern Project\"), and Walsh Bay Arts Precinct. The Regional Cultural Fund is also under infrastructure.\n\n, Create NSW managed nine properties in and around the Sydney CBD: Carriageworks multi-arts centre, the former Darlinghurst Gaol, the Walsh Bay Arts Precinct (including Wharf 4/5), the Roslyn Packer Theatre, the Parachute Ground at Lilyfield, The Gunnery, Garry Owen House, and the Arts Exchange in The Rocks area.\n\nArts organisations and festivals\nThe NSW performing arts sector includes 11 of Australia\u2019s major performing arts organisations, including The Australian Ballet, Australian Brandenburg Orchestra, Australian Chamber Orchestra, Bangarra Dance Theatre, Bell Shakespeare Company, Belvoir, Musica Viva Australia, Opera Australia, Sydney Dance Company, Sydney Symphony Orchestra, and the Sydney Theatre Company.\n\nCreate NSW provides support for four major cultural festivals: the Biennale of Sydney, the Sydney Festival, the Sydney Film Festival, and the Sydney Writers' Festival. In collaboration with the federal government through the Visual Arts and Craft Strategy (VACS), Create NSW helps to support the careers of artist, craft practitioners and arts professionals such as curators, through programs at the Australian Centre for Photography, Art Gallery of NSW, Sydney Biennale, dLux MediaArts, Artspace Visual Arts Centre (housed in The Gunnery), the Australian Design Centre and the Museum of Contemporary Art Australia.\n\nFunding for the arts in NSW\nBecause of the changes in name and organisational structure over the years, funding by Create NSW is difficult to track, but in 2013\u201314, Arts NSW allocated  million to arts and cultural development, and in 2018\u20139,  million in arts grants. In addition, the 2018\u20139 Cultural Infrastructure Plan allocated  million to the new Powerhouse Museum in Parramatta,  and large amounts to the Walsh Bay Arts Precinct, Art Gallery of NSW\u2019s Sydney Modern Project, Sydney Opera House renovations, the Riverside Theatres redevelopment, the Regional Cultural Fund, and expansion of the Australian Museum, totalling  billion on infrastructure. After so much spending on buildings, there was less left for spending on either commissions by artists or emergencies. Owing to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia, special sector support packages were provided by the governments of South Australia ( million), Queensland ( million) and Victoria ( million), while  Create NSW had only redirected  million of its existing budget to support the arts during the crisis.\n\nAgency executives\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\nArts\nMinistries established in 1971\nArts in Australia", "machine_text": "Create NSW is a government-funded agency in New South Wales, Australia, which seeks to support and encourage the growth of the arts and cultural sector in the state.

It stars Mike McLeod, John Dunsworth, Jane Alexander, Hugh Thompson, Olympia Dukakis, Brenda Fricker, Wendy Crewson, Bruce Davison, Jeremy Akerman, Ryan Doucette, Candy Palmater, Ed Asner, Gharrett Patrick Paon and Rob Joseph Leonard.\n\nThe series began its original broadcast on September 4, 2013 on Super Channel in Canada. It aired its second season in 2015, and its third in 2018.\n\nPlot\nThe Priest (Mike McLeod), whose actual name is never given throughout the series, is the junior priest at a Roman Catholic church in Nova Scotia. With young men now rarely joining the Catholic priesthood, he is serving under a Prelate (John Dunsworth) and older priests Gene (Jeremy Akerman) and Phil (Rob Joseph Leonard), who are all near retirement; he is planned to eventually take over as the parish's main pastor, but currently performs lesser duties such as hearing confessions. The Priest comes from a dysfunctional family background; he was raised primarily by his grandmother Novalea (Olympia Dukakis) after his mother abandoned the family, while his brother was born with fetal alcohol syndrome and has frequently bounced in and out of jail for various crimes.\n\nIn the first episode, The Priest learns that Victoria (Naomi Blackhall-Butler), his girlfriend before he entered the seminary, lied to him when she got pregnant with his baby; she claimed at the time that she had an abortion, but did not. In fact, he has a teenage daughter named Noelle (Lauren Liem), and thus faces the dilemma of how to take parental responsibility for her on a priest's salary while simultaneously preventing the parish and the bishop (Ed Asner) from finding out about it. At the same time, he is having trouble sleeping at night and is regularly haunted by visions of Saint Sebastian (Ryan Doucette), which is beginning to impact his physical health.\n\nThe centrepiece of each episode is an extended dialogue in the confessional booth between The Priest and a parishioner; outside of this, however, plot development takes place through multi-episode story arcs rather than each episode comprising a self-contained story, and the show carries the stories of a few confessioners through multiple episodes rather than featuring new confessioners every week. The confessions serve to explore both themes of moral complexity within Roman Catholic doctrine, and the ethical dilemmas facing The Priest as he tries to get involved in helping the parishioners with their issues outside the confession booth.\n\nThe show's main narrative throughline begins with the confession of Johnny \"Smith\" O'Leary (Hugh Thompson), who initially confesses to having had inappropriate sexual thoughts about an underage girl, but soon reveals that he was himself sexually abused as a child by a former choirmaster at this very church and that Father Gene was involved in covering it up, setting up The Priest's biggest ethical conflict as he cannot help O'Leary to pursue justice and healing without breaking the Seal of the Confessional or undermining his own employer. Secondary storylines include the journey of Bookie (Jane Alexander), a woman who left the church decades earlier after being told that she could not have an abortion even to end a non-viable pregnancy that would have killed her, toward reconciliation with the church after she is diagnosed with terminal cancer; the desire of Agnes (Candy Palmater) to become a single mother through in vitro fertilization; Sebastian's emergence as a real person who challenges The Priest over the church's position on homosexuality; and the struggles of Celeste (Wendy Crewson), a former federal Member of Parliament who lost her job as a media pundit after her role in a political scandal was revealed.\n\nCritical response\nThe series was generally well-received, attaining positive reviews. John Doyle of The Globe and Mail compared it to In Treatment, praised Mike McLeod's performance as \"superb\", noted \"a visual sumptuousness that's startling\" and called it \"a powerful 30 minutes of television.\" Brad Oswald of the Winnipeg Free Press wrote \"The confessional-confined dialogue is smart, and the stripped-down performances are seamlessly delivered and punctuated with moments of pure, stark, painful honesty.\"\n\nWeb series\nIn 2016, the companion web series Forgive Me Web Confessions was launched, again starring McLeod as The Priest, with Keelin Jack, Krista MacDonald and Callum Dunphy as penitents.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Elizabeth Fretwell\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Betty Drina Fretwell  (13 August 1920 \u2013 5 June 2006), known professionally as Elizabeth Fretwell, was an Australian soprano.  She was the prima donna at London's Sadler's Wells Opera (English National Opera) through much of the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nEarly life and career \nShe was born in Murrumbeena, a suburb of Melbourne. As a child, she had hoped to become a ballerina. However, she grew too big for this profession. She focussed instead on singing, taking vocal studies in Melbourne. Her operatic career began in 1950. In 1954, she sang Antonia in Offenbach's The Tales of Hoffmann before Queen Elizabeth II who was on her first tour of Australia. In order to gain greater skill, she moved to London to study under the tenor Joseph Hislop who had also coached Jussi Bj\u00f6rling and Birgit Nilsson.\n\nAfter returning to Australia she quickly started to make a name for herself, taking soprano roles in operas by Mozart and Puccini, amongst others. It was while on an Australian national tour of Tosca that she had an extramarital affair with the Australian baritone Robert Simmons (they were later to marry), with whom she later had a son, John Simmons, now a Melbourne architect, and a daughter Geraldine 'Geri' Roggiero n\u00e9e Simmons now a Sydney wildlife artist.  This caused a scandal in 1950s Australia so she and Simmons headed for the United Kingdom.\n\nSadler's Wells\nOnce in Britain, Fretwell's first professional engagement was for Dublin's Grand Opera company.  Her performances there came to the attention of Sadler's Wells and in 1955 they engaged her services as principal soprano. It was at this point she became known as Elizabeth Fretwell. Sadler's was where Fretwell's finest performances were given, and she gained rave reviews. This was no small achievement given that at that time Maria Callas was dominant on the London opera stage. From the early 1960s to 1970 she went back and forth between Australia and the UK performing. In 1965 she gave her only performances at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in Aida and Il tabarro. She also performed with Scottish and Canadian companies and in North America.\n\nLater career and death\nIn 1969 Fretwell sang opposite Tito Gobbi in Falstaff, finally joining the ensemble of The Australian Opera in 1970.  During 1973 she sang in the opening season of the Sydney Opera House. She remained a member of the Australian Opera (now Opera Australia) until her retirement. In her later career, she took on smaller roles, to give up-and-coming singers there a chance to further their careers as principal singers.\n\nHer retirement was very low key; no one in the company knew of her impending retirement before she left. She did not want any fanfare or accolades at her last performance, and therefore only the management of the Australian Opera knew of her decision to retire in the late 1980s. She simply gave her last performance, then quietly went to her dressing room, packed up her makeup and personal belongings, and went home to her beloved house at Bayview, on the northern beaches of Sydney, and reverted to her married name of Betty Simmons.   She later served on the Opera Foundation's board for a number of years.\n \nShe was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1977.  On 5 June 2006, she died suddenly at her Bayview home, from a ruptured cerebral artery aneurysm, aged 85.   She was survived by her son and daughter, and four grandchildren.\n\nReferences\n\n1920 births\n2006 deaths\nAustralian operatic sopranos\nSingers from Melbourne\nAustralian Officers of the Order of the British Empire\n20th-century Australian women opera singers", "machine_text": "Elizabeth Fretwell was an accomplished American educator who dedicated her life to advancing education and fostering academic excellence.
