The film takes its name from a song by the singer/songwriter Donny Hathaway, and is set in Los Angeles in the early 1960s. The film follows the life of a young African-American man who is trying to break into the radio business as a disc jockey, and the people he meets along the way. The film features an ensemble cast that includes Denzel Washington, Robert Wisdom, Percy Miller, Deborah Ann Ryan, and John M. Watson. The film was released in 1996, and was well-received by critics. It was nominated for two Independent Spirit Awards, for Best Feature and Best Male Lead (for Washington). It was also nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. The film is set in Los Angeles in the early 1960s, and follows the life of a young African-American man named Ron (\"Radio\") Roberts (Denzel Washington), who is trying to break into the radio business as a disc jockey. Radio works as a delivery boy for a local record store, and spends his free time listening to music and practicing his disc jockey skills in his bedroom. He is also trying to get his own show on the local black-owned radio station, but the station's manager, Mr. D (John M. Watson), is not interested in giving Radio a chance. However, Radio's life changes when he meets a beautiful young woman named Stormy (Deborah Ann Ryan), who is also a disc jockey at the local white-owned radio station. Stormy is interested in Radio, and they begin dating. However, their relationship is complicated by the fact that Stormy is white, and Radio is black. They face racism and prejudice from both their families and their communities, but they are determined to stay together. As Radio and Stormy try to make their relationship work, they are also trying to break into the radio business. Stormy gets a chance to host her own show at the local white-owned radio station, but the station's manager, Mr. B (Robert Wisdom), is not interested in giving Stormy a chance. However, Stormy is determined to make it happen, and she starts her own radio show from her bedroom. As Stormy's show becomes more and more popular, Radio starts to feel left behind. He is still trying to get his own show at the local black-owned radio station, but the station's manager, Mr. D, is still not interested in giving him a chance. However, Radio is determined to make it happen, and he starts his own radio show from his bedroom. As both Stormy and Radio's shows grow in popularity, they start to compete with each other for listeners. They both want to be the best, and they both want to be heard. However, they are also trying to make their relationship work, and they are trying to break into the radio business. The Real Quiet Storm is a powerful story about love, determination, and the power of the human spirit. It is a story about two people who are trying to make their relationship work, and who are trying to break into the radio business. It is a story about the power of the human will, and about the importance of never giving up.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 43294873}

The observatory is currently owned by Turun Ursa ry, a local astronomical association operating in Turku area. The buildings of the observatory include an observatory dome, a zenith observatory, and a house for recording observations.  Kevola Observatory has code 064 in the IAU/MPC observatory list. The main-belt asteroid 1540\u00a0Kevola was named after the observatory.  History   The observatory was built in 1963 by T\u00e4htitieteellis-optillinen seura (Astronomy-Optical Society) on a small hill on lands of the home farm of Hilkka Rantasepp\u00e4-Helenius. She worked at the time as an observer at Tuorla Observatory of University of Turku. The association was founded by Yrj\u00f6 V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4, Liisi Oterma, Hilkka Rantasepp\u00e4-Helenius, and other astronomers working at University of Turku.  The association was terminated in 1983. In 1986 the observatory building was passed to Turun Ursa, also founded by Yrj\u00f6 V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4. The land of the observatory was rented from a local farmer until 2002, when Turun Ursa received a grant from Viljo, Yrj\u00f6 ja Kalle V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4n rahasto (Viljo, Yrj\u00f6 and Kalle V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 Fund) to purchase the land.  Astronomical instruments   The observatory dome houses a 50\u00a0cm anastigmatic Schmidt-V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 camera, which was earlier located at Iso-Heikkil\u00e4 Observatory, where it was used in an asteroid hunt to find 807 minor planets and 7 comets. The telescope has a 50\u00a0cm corrector menisculus and a 60\u00a0cm primary mirror with focal length of 1031\u00a0mm. It has a 6.7 degree field of view on 12x12 cm film plates, making it ideal for searching asteroids. Attached to the main telescope are two guide telescopes: an 18\u00a0cm and an 8\u00a0cm refractor.  The zenith tower originally housed a 250/5150\u00a0mm zenith telescope that was used to observe the movements of the axis of the earth. After the T\u00e4htitieteellis-optillinen seura was ended, the telescope was moved to Tuorla Observatory. As the zenith tower does not have a dome but a roof that opens to the sides, and has therefore little use for normal observations, it remains unused.

These countries included the USSR and all the Comecon members. NMP is the conceptual equivalent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the United Nations System of National Accounts, although numerically the two measures are calculated differently.  NMP is calculated for the material production sectors only, and excludes most of the service sectors, which are part of GDP. The material production sectors include manufacturing industries,  agriculture and forestry, construction, wholesale and retail trade, supply of material inputs, road maintenance, freight transport (but not passenger transport), communication and information services supporting material production, and other material production activities. It is calculated by subtracting the value of all production costs (including the cost of material inputs, depreciation, and labor in production) from the value of output produced in the material production sectors.  For comparison with GDP, it is necessary to add back to NMP the value of fixed asset depreciation (which is not subtracted in GDP calculations) and the total value of all services classified as \"non-productive\" in the socialist system of national accounts (which are part of GDP). These \"non-productive\" services include health care, education, housing, public utilities, consumer services, communication in the non-productive sector, passenger transport, financial services (banking, credit, insurance), government services, the defense establishment, and social organizations. The tax components subtracted in the calculation of GDP should also be added back to obtain NMP.

In the lyrics, Henley reflects on that period, and on the passage of time since then, when the Eagles broke up, and many of their contemporaries fell victim to drug and alcohol addiction. \"I Knew Jesus (Before He Was a Star)\" is one of the few songs on The End of the Innocence that explicitly refers to Henley's Christian faith, which is expressed more generally in several other songs on the album, including \"The Heart of the Matter\", \"The Last Worthless Evening\", and \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\". In \"I Knew Jesus (Before He Was a Star)\", Henley sings that he \"knew Jesus before he was a star, before he was a man, when he was just a child, I knew him\". In the lyrics, Jesus is described as \"the son of a carpenter\" and \"a young boy from Nazareth\". The song includes a reference to \"the last supper\", and the \"betrayal and the kiss\", which are events from the Last Supper as told in the Gospel of Luke. The song also refers to Jesus' \"mother Mary\", and to \"the blood on the cross\", which is an event from the Passion of Jesus as told in the Gospel of John. The music video for the song, directed by David Fincher, includes a cameo appearance by actor Jack Black as a Jesus look-alike. The song was included on the soundtrack to the 2004 film Sideways. \"I Knew Jesus (Before He Was a Star)\" was released as a single in the United States in November 2003, and in the United Kingdom in February 2004. The single included a live version of the Eagles' \"The Last Resort\" as a B-side. A music video was released for the song, directed by David Fincher. The video features Jack Black as a Jesus look-alike. The video was included as a bonus feature on the Eagles' 2005 documentary, Hell Freezes Over. \"I Knew Jesus (Before He Was a Star)\" was included on the soundtrack to the 2004 film Sideways. The song was covered by Amy Grant on her 2005 album Rock of Ages...Hymns and Faith. \"I Knew Jesus (Before He Was a Star)\" was used in an episode of the TV series Brothers & Sisters in 2009. The song was covered by American country music artist Trisha Yearwood for her 2013 album, Prizefighter.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 19234121}

A founder of the society, Henry Page Croft, later wrote that \"It was started by three or four of us who held the view that nothing was worth fighting for except Chamberlain's battle, and we determined to do our best to drive the enemies of tariff reform out of the Conservative Party\".  It was a secret society in order, according to Croft, \"to appear much more important than we in fact were. Our idea was to endeavour to get large numbers of young men drawn from the aristocracy and country gentlemen who would devote themselves to the cause and fight constituencies wherever and whenever they were required\". At their height they numbered around 50 members, with 30 entering Parliament, 9 gaining office and 4 becoming Cabinet ministers. Sir Arthur Steel-Maitland was a member. Edward Goulding was closely connected with the Confederacy.  The first meetings were held at Fanhams Hall. The organisational skills of Thomas Comyn Platt and others ensured the Confederacy received national attention in the press and elsewhere.

It was formed in 1978 by a merger of the National Front (NF) with the British National Party (BNP), and was led by John Tyndall. The group was active in the National Front until the early 1990s, and played a significant role in the foundation and development of the British National Party. The NF had been established in 1967 by a group of former members of the British Union of Fascists (BUF), and had won two seats in the House of Commons in the 1979 general election. However, it had become divided into two factions, one of which was led by Tyndall, who favoured a more working-class approach. In 1980, the two factions merged, with the group that supported Tyndall's ideas forming the core of the new Confederacy. The Confederacy was opposed to the 'multi-cultural society' and believed that the NF's approach was too extreme. It sought to develop a more pragmatic approach, and focused its activities on the working class, arguing that the NF's middle-class support was insufficient to win power. It also sought to develop a more professional approach, and adopted the title 'The British Nationalist Party' for its electoral candidates. In 1981, it won three seats in the House of Commons, and in 1982 it won a further two seats. However, the Confederacy was also beset by internal divisions, and in 1983 it split into two factions, one of which was led by Tyndall, and the other by Andrew Brons. The two factions reunited in 1985, but the group remained unstable, and in 1990 it finally split into two separate groups, the British National Party and the British Democratic Party.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 41570151}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"The Phantom Freighter\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Phantom Freighter is Volume 26 in the original The Hardy Boys Mystery Stories published by Grosset & Dunlap.  This book was written for the Stratemeyer Syndicate by Amy McFarlane, the wife of long time Hardy Boys author Leslie McFarlane, in 1947. Between 1959 and 1973 the first 38 volumes of this series were systematically revised as part of a project directed by Harriet Adams, Edward Stratemeyer's daughter. The original version of this book was shortened in 1970 by Priscilla Baker-Carr resulting in two similar stories sharing the same title.  Plot summary The Hardy brothers embark on a freighter trip under mysterious circumstances and find themselves involved with a smuggling ring.  The Hardy Boys discover that the Phantom Freighter is really a smuggling ship used to smuggle counterfeit documents, illegal drugs, cowhides, and electric motors.  Aunt Gertrude's carton Enigmatic stranger Thaddeus McClintock arrives in Bayport and engages Frank and Joe Hardy to arrange for a relaxing trip for him (with the Boys to accompany him) with the mysterious promise of \u201cI\u2019ll pay all expenses and when the trip is over you\u2019ll be paid. Money, if you like. Or something else.\u201d Meanwhile, Aunt Gertrude has arrived and announced that she is going to be living in the Hardy household long term. The shipping company incorrectly delivers one of her cartons, delivering instead a box apparently of raw wool addressed to a Mr. Johnson to the Hardy\u2019s address. After expressing her anger at the shipping company as the carton contains valuable family papers, Aunt Gertrude sends the boys to the address marked on the box to swap the packages. Arriving at the remote farm, the boys find nobody home but the barn ablaze. Frank breaks into the barn to rescue a carton believed to be Aunt Gertrude\u2019s, only to find out it contained discarded newspapers. The owner of the barn arrives and is shocked to find that someone had been staying at his house and having packages delivered while he was out of town. After getting a description of the man who signed for the package from the delivery driver, the boys spot a man matching that description at a clothing store and follow him to the docks where he disappears.  Going fishing Later, after reviewing several other modes of travel with Mr. McClintock, the boys suggest a cruise on an oceangoing freighter, to which Mr. McClintock is receptive. The boys then try repeatedly to book passage on freighters scheduled through Bayport, but are rebuffed at every turn. The travel agency they attempted to work through, owned by Mr. Klack, seems more interested in keeping them off ships than arranging their passage. Even when the boys are successful at obtaining tickets through an out-of-town travel agency, an unknown individual posing to act on their behalf picks up their tickets, again preventing them from setting sail. At the suggestion of loyal Hardy friend Chet Morton (who is trying his hand at fly-tying), the boys and Mr. McClintock employ local fishing captain Harkness to take them on a fishing expedition. Captain Harkness agrees to take the trip, provided they avoid Barmet Shoals as he recently spotted a phantom freighter there that left him spooked and shaken. After landing a monstrous tuna to the delight of Mr. McClintock and heading back to Bayport, their boat runs out of gas to the disbelief of Captain Harkness. As night falls, the party on the boat is horrified to see a freighter cutting through the sea toward them, only to go silent and dark. Though the boys try hard to locate the ship, it is neither heard or sighted again and has disappeared by first light. Rescue comes from a coastal patrol aircraft and ship the next day.  Mysteries in Bayport Meanwhile, numerous other break-ins are discovered in and around Bayport during which nothing was stolen from unoccupied houses, but packages are delivered and signed for by people unknown to the owners. Fenton Hardy reveals that he is working on a case of forged historical documents which have been appearing in the rare document trade.  Aunt Gertrude takes a trip to Bridgewater, evasively answering questions about where and why she is going. The boys follow her to Bridgewater and find her meeting with an elderly woman the boys previously identified as one of the people involved in the package delivery scheme.  Taking a cruise The boys recruit their friend Biff Hooper to help them book passage, which turns to their advantage as an out-of-town travel agent arranges their cruise aboard the Father Neptune. Meeting Captain Gramwell of the Father Neptune, the boys learn that one crew member recently left the ship ill and a new hand had been hired. Suspicious, the boys investigate and find the crewman had in fact been kidnapped and the new hand was sent to interrupt the trip. Captain Gramwell reacts quickly and has the new crewman, recognized by the boys as part of the smuggling ring, arrested and questioned to find his missing crewman, who is recovered.  Mr. McClintock, the boys, Biff, and Chet board the Father Neptune in Southport. At sea, the cargo aboard the Father Neptune suddenly shifts, leaving the ship listing badly and in danger of sinking. The crew and passengers rush to redistribute the cargo, eventually restoring the ship upright.  The boys tell Captain Gramwell about the smuggling ring and phantom ship. Captain Gramwell has the ship\u2019s radio operator contact all the ships in the area and discovers that the Lion Tamer spotted just such a ship nearby. Spotting the ship at nightfall, the Father Neptune pursues the mystery ship, identified as the Black Gull, but is unable to overtake it, much to the frustration of Captain Gramwell as the Father Neptune is declared to be the fastest ship in those waters and the mystery ship is obviously older and slower. That night, the mystery ship is again sighted, dark and apparently adrift. Along with the Father Nepture'''s radio operator Sparks, the boys row over to the ship while the Father Neptune keeps a spotlight on the mystery ship to hide the rowboat. This scene is depicted on the cover of the book. Upon boarding the mystery ship, the party finds the ship seemingly abandoned, but are suddenly jumped by the ship\u2019s crew and captured.  Captivity Held captive with Sparks aboard the Black Gull by the chief smuggler Crowfoot, the boys pretend to cast in with the smuggler. Crowfeet tells the boys about the ship\u2019s secret repeller belts around the hull which hold off any motorized vessel or aircraft, allowing the Black Gull (under many different names) to escape from much faster ships and explaining how the boys adrift in the fishing boat were able to get so close with the fishing boat's engine shut down due to fuel exhaustion. After the Black Gull's radio operator falls ill, Crowfeet presses a seemingly reluctant Sparks into service to send messages. The boys then take turns sending coded messages via innocent-sounding nursery rhymes to their father, including the line \u201csailing, sailing, over the bounding main, for many a sailing ship can go faster\u2026\u201d. Soon a sleek racing sloop under full sail  (immune to the effects of the repeller which only affects motor vessels) approaches and quickly overtakes the slow freighter. Coast Guard officers board and rescue the boys, Sparks, and the captured scientists who had been kidnapped and forced to work for the smuggler. Among them is a chemist who had developed the techniques used to artificially age paper to supply forged documents for sale in the antique / rare document market. The elderly \u201csmuggler\u201d Mitchell turns out to be Mr. McClintock's former business partner and is happily reunited with Mr. McClintock aboard the Father Neptune. With Mitchell rescued, the entire design for the repeller belt is recovered and Mr. McClintock and Mitchell agree to turn the design over to the US Government. The boys, Chet, Biff, and Mr. McClintock then continue their cruise to the Caribbean. The reader is left with a note that the Hardy Boys next mystery will be The Secret of Skull Mountain''.

Career H\u00f6jer was born on 12 August 1890 in Visby, Sweden, the son of Professor Nils H\u00f6jer and Emmy H\u00f6jer. He began to study medicine at the Karolinska Institute in 1908 and became a Licentiate of Medicine in 1916. He went to Paris in 1919, where he became acquainted with the nurse Signe Dahl and they later married in 1920.  In addition to his work and social commitment, in the early 1920s H\u00f6jer researched vitamin C and its role in connective tissue cell maturation. He submitted his thesis in Stockholm in 1924 for PhD degree as Studies in scurvy, and then became the Associate Professor of Hygiene in the Physiological Institute at Lund University.  In 1930, he was appointed as the city physician () of Malm\u00f6 and subsequently, in 1935, became Director General of the National Swedish Board of Health, a post he left in 1952. During his time on the Medical Board, he made several reforms in terms of preventive care, including family planning, maternal assistance and care of infants as well as dental services. Additionally during that time, the Vipeholm experiments on dental caries were conducted.  H\u00f6jer was appointed to the UN's expert commission for economic affairs and its housing commission. He was sent as a special officer for improving medical education in India at the request of Travancore-Cochin state (present-day Kerala state). H\u00f6jer was appointed as the Principal of the Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala, a position he held until 1954.  After retirement, he worked on international issues, including the effects of the Vietnam War.  The H\u00f6jer Investigation  H\u00f6jer led the Board of Health study in 1948 on health care reorganization. The study suggested a focus on preventive care and strengthening of provincial medical offices. The proposal was motivated in particular by the fact that the proportion of primary care physicians had declined because of the sharp increase in hospital doctors. In the study, the Medical Board argued against the Medical Association's view with regard to primary care. The report advocated a polyclinic model, where outpatient health care would be free and community-run.  The H\u00f6jer study was the first more comprehensive attempt to analyze the problems in outpatient care. It suggested the establishment of health centers of various kinds. The larger centers would include both specialists and general practitioners and would be located in hospitals. The minor ones would have two or more GPs and be located in the provincial doctors' stations. H\u00f6jer encountered considerable resistance from the medical professionals. He was exposed to virulent press campaign from colleagues calling for his resignation. As a result of complaints the commission's proposals could not be realized.  Controversies  H\u00f6jer's combination of pacifism, socialism, anti-clericalism, anti-Nazism and temperance led to political persecution in Sydsvenska Dagbladet and Aftonbladet, Swedish newspapers. He was dismissed from a job as a teacher in the Southern Sweden Nursing School on the grounds that he held a lecture on sexual health. As city physician () in Malm\u00f6, he tried to address air pollution from the Scanian Cement factory at Limhamn in Malm\u00f6. The company director threatened Malm\u00f6 municipality, stating the company would move to another location if they followed the doctor's recommendations.  Concerning Jewish refugees, H\u00f6jer met stiff resistance from the management of the Swedish medical establishment. When a Jewish ophthalmologist had to leave his home after the German occupation of Danzig and tried to find work in Sweden, the medical professionals in the country sued to stop it, citing various reasons. A campaign with a hint of anti-Semitism was taken up by the medical establishments. When the Medical Board in 1939 planned to invite 12 Jewish specialty physicians to Sweden, the doctors' associations protested, suggesting it would lead to unemployment. , a protest arranged by the student body at Uppsala University, also spoke out against accepting Jewish refugees. The royal family intervened, and H\u00f6jer was called to the ruler, Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf, with the proposal that Sweden should accept only a small number of Jewish doctors who were fleeing Hitler's persecution. \"He asked me pleadingly to refrain from proposals and actions, which could put the unity of the Swedish people in danger. I answered respectfully but firmly \u2013 with the Court Marshal listening in the background \u2013 that I obviously did not want to increase the government's difficulties, but I found that the request is primarily aimed to appease the anti-Semitic circles. It would be ignominious if Sweden were to betray people in danger. The Crown Prince reiterated his warning. I declared I would keep it in mind the future, and would do it if my conscience allows. We parted without further discussion\". H\u00f6jer also asked to increase the number of doctors in the country, by importing Austrian physicians in 1950, which again was opposed by the Medical Association.

Simpson was born in Dublin, Ireland, the son of Walter Simpson, a Church of Ireland clergyman. He was called up to the army in 1941. In 1945 he transferred onto the army reserve and joined the Gate Theatre, Dublin as stage manager.  Career  In 1953 Simpson co-founded the Pike Theatre along with his wife Carolyn Swift. On November 19, 1954, Simpson staged the first ever production of The Quare Fellow by Brendan Behan, and, in 1955, he mounted the first Irish production of Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot, which went on to become one of the longest-running productions in Ireland up until that time. In 1957 he staged Tennessee Williams'  The Rose Tattoo during the first International Dublin Theatre Festival. Despite being hugely successful and receiving positive reviews from both Irish and English critics, the production sparked controversy when a member of the audience claimed to have seen a contraceptive produced during the performance. Simpson was arrested on May 21, 1957 [DIB] on a charge of producing an indecent and profane performance for gain  and was incarcerated for one night at Bridewell.  Despite the court case dragging on for the next year, Simpson was eventually discharged.  However, the costly legal proceedings had a devastating impact on Simpson both financially and personally  and eventually led to the closure of the Pike theatre in 1960. After his marriage to Swift broke down in 1961, he worked in several theatre productions in England and Scotland, after which he was hired as artistic adviser to the Abbey Theatre on a ten-month contract in 1968. Between 1969 and 1976 he directed numerous productions including The Hard life, She Stoops to Conquer, The Quare Fellow and others. He also staged in several musicals such as Jesus Christ Superstar in 1973  and Joseph and the amazing technicolor dreamcoat at the Gaiety Theatre. He later moved to the United States of America where he lectured at New York State University in 1978 and directed Androcles and the lion by George Bernard Shaw.  Simpson divorced his first wife, Carolyn Swift. He then married Irish actress, Eileen Colgan. Simpson and Colgan remained together until his death in 1980.

Simpson was born in Norwich, the son of a businessman, and was educated at Felsted School, Essex, and at Peterhouse, Cambridge, where he read History and was a member of the Footlights. In 1952 he joined the BBC as a radio producer, working on programmes including The Goon Show. He was encouraged to become a director by one of his early employers, the producer Michael Barry, who told him that he would only be given one chance to make a fool of himself. He began directing for the stage in 1958, and later that year made his professional debut with a production of Saint Joan by George Bernard Shaw at the Arts Theatre in London. Simpson's early work was mainly in the arena of comedy, and he worked with a number of writers who went on to become major figures in the British comedy scene, including John Cleese, Ronnie Barker, and Alan Ayckbourn. In 1964 he joined the National Theatre as a staff director, and remained there until 1973. His work there included the first London production of the musical Cabaret, which transferred to the West End. He also directed the play Travesties by Tom Stoppard, which was given a successful run in London before being transferred to Broadway. In 1973 Simpson joined the Royal Shakespeare Company, where he was to spend the rest of his career. He was a director there for more than twenty years, and was also an associate director, an education director, and, for six years, the artistic director of the Royal Shakespeare Theatre. His productions there included the first London production of the musical Les Mis\u00e9rables. He also directed a number of plays by Shakespeare, including Hamlet, Othello, The Merchant of Venice, and Pericles. Simpson's other work included a production of The Gondoliers by Gilbert and Sullivan for the English National Opera, and the film version of the musical The Magic Roundabout. He was the author of a number of books on theatre, including The Theatre of Tom Stoppard (1977) and The Making of a Drama (1984). Simpson was married to the actress Elspeth Gray, and the couple had three daughters.

He was probably a Lombard in the entourage of Charlemagne when he was sent in 788 to lead Hildeprand of Spoleto and Grimoald III of Benevento in cooperation with Frankish troops against a Byzantine invasion.  In this, his first recorded action, he was successful, defeating the Greeks led by Theodoros in Apulia. Hildeprand, however, died on the campaign and Charlemagne appointed Winiges to succeed him in the Duchy of Spoleto.  Winiges was appointed by Charlemagne to act as his missus dominicus in the Ducatus Romae and he was at Saint Peter's Basilica when Pope Leo III was assaulted on 25 April 799. It was then he who brought him to shelter in Spoleto until he could safely return to Rome.  Winiges got involved in a war with Grimoald of Benevento, however, and was captured while being besieged at Lucera in 802. He was held captive for a year before being released in 803.  While Leo III was nearing death in 815, the Roman citizens revolted, but King Bernard sent Winiges to Rome to quell the unrest.  In 822, Winiges abdicated his worldly office and retired to a monastery, where he died not too long after (probably that same year).

Winiges was a native of the Roman province of Illyricum, probably from the area of the lower Save River. He may have been of Hunnic or Saka descent. His father was a prominent general, and his grandfather a notable physician. Winiges was one of the leaders of the revolt against the Emperor Justinian I in the early 530s. He was given the rank of dux ( duke ) by the rebel leader, Gabriele Montani, whom he succeeded in May 531. After the fall of Rome to the rebels on 17 December 532, Winiges was one of the three dukes who governed the new entity, the Independent State of Italy, the others being Godescalc of Rimini and Theodore of Naples. The independence of Italy was only nominal, as the three dukes were quarreled with each other and the Gothic king, Witigis. When Witigis surrendered to the emperor in May 536, Winiges was one of the Gothic leaders who accompanied him to Constantinople. He returned to Italy in 539, leading a Byzantine army to assist the other dukes in fighting the Gothic resistance under Totila. He was one of the last dukes to resist the Gothic king, until he was captured by the Romans in the spring of 546. He was sent to Constantinople, where he was given an honorable captivity by the emperor. After his release, he may have been given command of the city of Naples.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The 2020 presidential campaign of Joe Biden began on April 25, 2019, when former vice president Joe Biden released a video announcing his candidacy in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, and concluded with him and his running mate Kamala Harris defeating incumbent president Donald Trump and vice president Mike Pence in the general election. Biden, the vice president of the United States from 2009 to 2017 and a former U.S. senator from Delaware, had been the subject of widespread speculation as a potential 2020 candidate after declining to be a candidate in the 2016 election, which saw Donald Trump winning over Hillary Clinton, who was supported by Biden.  Biden is generally described as a moderate, although he has recently described himself as progressive. His positions include codifying Roe v. Wade into statute, a public option for health insurance, decriminalization of recreational cannabis, passing the Equality Act, free community college, and a $1.7 trillion climate plan embracing the framework of the Green New Deal. He supports regulation, as opposed to a complete ban, on fracking.  As a former vice president and longtime United States senator, Biden entered the race with very high name recognition. From his campaign announcement up to the start of the elections, he was generally regarded as the Democratic front-runner. He led most national polls through 2019, but did not rank as one of the top three candidates in either the Iowa caucuses or the New Hampshire primary. At that point, some Democrats wondered if Biden's campaign was headed toward its demise. However, on February 29, 2020, he won a landslide victory in the 2020 South Carolina Democratic primary which reinvigorated his campaign. In March 2020, ten of his former competitors endorsed Biden, bringing the total number of such endorsements to 12. Biden earned enough delegates on Super Tuesday 2020 to pull ahead of Senator Bernie Sanders. On April 8, after Sanders suspended his campaign, Biden became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee.  In June, Biden reached the required number of delegates to become the nominee. On August 11, Biden announced that Senator Kamala Harris would be his vice presidential running mate. On August 18 and 19, Biden and Harris were officially nominated at the 2020 Democratic National Convention, making Harris the first Asian American and the first female African American to be nominated for vice president on a major party ticket. National opinion polls conducted in 2020 generally showed Biden leading Trump in favorability. On November 7, four days after Election Day, Biden was projected to have defeated Trump, becoming president-elect of the United States. Biden and Harris were sworn in on January 20, 2021.  Background  Previous presidential campaigns  Biden's 2020 presidential campaign was his third attempt to seek election for president of the United States. His first campaign was made in the 1988 Democratic Party primaries where he was initially considered one of the potentially strongest candidates. However, newspapers revealed plagiarism by Biden in law school records and in speeches, a scandal which led to his withdrawal from the race in September 1987.  He made the second attempt during the 2008 Democratic Party primaries, where he focused on his plan to achieve political success in the Iraq War through a system of federalization. Like his first presidential bid, Biden failed to garner endorsements and support. He withdrew from the race after his poor performance in the Iowa caucus on January 3, 2008. He was eventually chosen by Barack Obama as his running mate and won the general election as vice president of the United States, being sworn in on January 20, 2009.  Speculation Vice President Joe Biden was seen as a potential candidate to succeed Barack Obama in the 2016 presidential election. On October 21, 2015, following the death of his son Beau, Biden announced that he would not seek the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016.  During a tour of the U.S. Senate with reporters on December 5, 2016, Biden refused to rule out a potential bid for the presidency in the 2020 presidential election. He reasserted his ambivalence about running on an appearance of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on December 7, in which he stated \"never say never\" about running for president in 2020, while also admitting he did not see a scenario in which he would run for office again. He seemingly announced on January 13, 2017, exactly one week prior to the expiration of his vice presidential term, that he would not run. However, four days later, he seemed to backtrack, stating \"I'll run if I can walk.\" In September 2017, Biden's daughter Ashley indicated her belief that he was thinking about running in 2020.  Time for Biden  Time for Biden, a political action committee, was formed in January 2018, seeking Biden's entry into the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries.  The organization was criticized by some, who felt it was created too early and that Democratic effort should be spent on the 2018 midterm elections. The ''Time for Biden'' was also criticized as many thought that Biden was too old, and wanted more young progressive candidates going into the primary cycle.  Considering his options In February 2018, Biden informed a group of longtime foreign policy aides that he was \"keeping his 2020 options open\".  In March 2018, Politico reported that Biden's team was considering a number of options to distinguish their campaign, such as announcing at the outset a younger vice presidential candidate from outside of politics, and also reported that Biden had rejected a proposition to commit to serving only one term as president. On July 17, 2018, he told a forum held in Bogota, Colombia, that he would decide if he would formally declare as a candidate by January 2019. On February 4, with no decision having been forthcoming from Biden, Edward-Isaac Dovere of The Atlantic wrote that Biden was \"very close to saying yes\" but that some close to him are worried he will have a last-minute change of heart, as he did in 2016. Dovere reported that Biden was concerned about the effect another presidential run could have on his family and reputation, as well as fundraising struggles and perceptions about his age and relative centrism compared to other declared and potential candidates. Conversely, his \"sense of duty\", offense at the Trump presidency, the lack of foreign policy experience among other Democratic hopefuls and his desire to foster \"bridge-building progressivism\" in the party were said to be factors prompting him to run.  Campaign  Announcement  On March 12, 2019, he told a gathering of his supporters he may need their energy \"in a few weeks\". Five days later, Biden accidentally revealed that he would be a candidate at a dinner in Dover, Delaware.  On April 19, 2019, The Atlantic reported that Biden planned to officially announce his campaign five days later via a video announcement, followed by a launch rally in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, or Charlottesville, Virginia. Charlottesville was the subject of Biden's kick-off campaign video due to its white supremacist riot in 2017. In the days before his expected launch, several major Democratic donors received requests to donate to his campaign committee, to be named \"Biden for President\". Subsequent reports indicated that Biden's plans remained uncertain, with no known launch date, locations for campaign rallies, or permits for an event in Philadelphia; associates continued to plan a fundraiser on April 25 in Philadelphia hosted by Comcast executive vice president David L. Cohen, but it was unclear whether the fundraiser would be held as planned, though his associates had continued to solicit donations in the days leading up to his announcement. On April 23, it was reported that Biden would formally enter the race two days later, so as to avoid overshadowing a forum focusing on women of color held the day before. The campaign reserved the Teamsters Local 249 union hall in Pittsburgh for April 29.  On May 22, the magazine Ebony reported that Biden had begun assembling his 2020 presidential campaign team, to be headquartered in Philadelphia. His team included campaign manager Greg Schultz and director of strategic communications Kamau Mandela Marshall, who both previously worked in the Obama administration, as well as other senior advisors from the Obama administration. Additionally, on May 31, the Biden campaign announced that Congressman Cedric Richmond would join the campaign as the national co-chairman.  Key people  Steve Ricchetti, campaign chairman Mike Donilon, chief strategist Greg Schultz, 1st campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon, 2nd campaign manager Anita Dunn, senior advisor Symone Sanders, senior advisor Ron Klain, former Chief of Staff to the Vice President, senior advisor Valerie Biden Owens, sister of Joe Biden, senior advisor  Economic policy  Jeffrey Zients, former Director of the National Economic Council Jared Bernstein, Former Chief Economics Advisor to Joe Biden Heather Boushey, economist Ben Harris, former Chief Economist and Chief Economic Advisor to Vice President Joe Biden  Fundraising and strategy  On April 26, 2019, Biden's campaign announced that they had raised $6.3 million in the first 24 hours, surpassing all other candidates' first 24-hour fundraising totals for the Democratic presidential nomination at that time. Biden's fundraising came from 128,000 unique contributors, equivalent to that of Beto O'Rourke's campaign, but about 40% lower than that of Bernie Sanders, who had 223,000 unique contributors in the first 24 hours of his campaign.  According to a Politico article, the Biden campaign was operating on the premise that the Democratic base is not nearly as liberal or youthful as perceived. Privately, several Biden advisers acknowledged that their theory was based on polling data and voting trends, contending that the media is pushing the idea of a hyper-progressive Democratic electorate being propagated by a Twitter bubble and being out of touch with the average rank-and-file Democrat. In April 2019, Biden told reporters, \"The fact of the matter is the vast majority of the members of the Democratic Party are still basically liberal to moderate Democrats in the traditional sense.\" Biden also described himself as an \"Obama-Biden Democrat\". An unspecified Biden adviser said, \"There's a big disconnect between the media narrative and what the primary electorate looks like and thinks, versus the media narrative and the Twitter narrative [and] the Democratic primary universe is far less liberal. It's older than you think it is.\" From April 25 to May 25, 2019, Biden's campaign spent 83% of his total $1.2   million Facebook ad funding on targeting voters 45 years and older. No other top 2020 Democratic candidate has pursued a similar strategy in the primary.  Biden, along with Bernie Sanders, was often perceived as the candidate with the best chance of defeating Donald Trump in the general election. According to The Washington Post, this may be because of his more moderate policies, or it may be because voters or party leaders believe a white male candidate is more \"electable\". Joe Biden said that his late son Beau should be running instead of him if he were alive. Biden led most national polls through 2019.  The Biden campaign came to rely on volunteer groups such as the Biden Digital Coalition for their social media presence and for tracking disinformation.   The campaign raised $70 million during the 2020 Democratic National Convention. The campaign and DNC combined raised a record $365 million in August 2020, compared to $154 million by Trump and the RNC. Biden raised another $383 million in September 2020, breaking his own record from the previous month.  Early primary election results   During the Iowa caucuses held on February 3, 2020, Biden came in fourth place, earning six pledged delegates. In the New Hampshire primary held on February 11, Biden came in fifth place and did not earn any delegates due to his failure to meet the required 15% eligibility threshold. After poor showings in Iowa and New Hampshire, some media outlets questioned whether Biden's status as the most electable candidate was accurate.  Biden won the South Carolina primary election held on February 29. Biden won all 46 counties in the state, winning 48.7% of the popular vote and earning 39 delegates. The win was largely attributed to his support from 61% of African-American voters (African-American voters make up approximately 60% of the Democratic electorate in South Carolina). Before the primary on February 26, Jim Clyburn endorsed Biden. Many cited Clyburn's endorsement as a reason for Biden's wide margin of victory, as Clyburn's endorsement is a deciding factor for many African American voters in South Carolina. Thirty-six percent of all primary voters said that they made their decision after Clyburn's endorsement; of that total, 70% voted for Biden. According to FiveThirtyEight, the outcome significantly boosted Biden's chance of winning multiple Super Tuesday states (especially southern states like North Carolina, Texas, and Virginia).  In early March, shortly before Super Tuesday, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar dropped out of the race and endorsed Biden, widely perceived as attempts to slow down Sanders' momentum in the primaries. Beto O'Rourke, Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, who had all suspended their campaign months before, also endorsed Biden at around the same time. On the Super Tuesday primary elections on March 3, Biden won Alabama, Arkansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia, earning a total of 458 delegates, and pulling ahead of Bernie Sanders in the race. According to an exit poll, Biden received a substantial amount of support from voters who made up their minds in the last few days before the election. Late voters also preferred a candidate who they believed could defeat Trump more than one who agreed with them on issues.  On March 9, CNN reported that Biden had a double-digit lead over Sanders in a nationwide poll. On March 12, with the coronavirus pandemic looming, Biden changed campaign managers, replacing Greg Schultz with Jen O'Malley Dillon.  In mid-March, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, many of the scheduled primaries were postponed. Aides to both Biden's and Sanders's campaigns were in contact regarding the pandemic and its effects.  Nomination Leading up to the 11th Democratic presidential debate, Biden announced two new progressive policies: making public colleges and universities tuition-free for students of families whose income is less than $125,000, and allowing for student loan debts to default during bankruptcy. The debate was held on March 15, 2020, and was the first to feature only the race's two lead finalists. Biden announced that if he secured the nomination, he would choose a female running mate, having previously hinted as much by naming several contenders. On April 3, Biden announced that his campaign would unveil a committee to vet prospective vice presidential candidates later in the month.  On March 15, Jen O'Malley Dillon was announced as the new campaign manager.  On March 25, when asked whether he would debate Sanders again, Biden said, \"My focus is just dealing with this crisis right now. I haven't thought about any more debates. I think we've had enough debates. I think we should get on with this.\" On April 8, after Sanders suspended his campaign, Biden became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. The next day, a former Senate staffer made a sexual assault allegation against Biden, which his campaign denied. On May 1, Biden stated that the allegation was false and requested that the secretary of the Senate work with the National Archives and Records Administration to identify and release any relevant documents. The Senate denied this request, saying personnel files are \"strictly confidential\". Two weeks later, Biden stated that he does not remember his accuser at all.  Biden-Sanders Unity Task Forces Sanders eventually dropped out of the race and endorsed Biden for president on April 13, and the two formed a series of task forces. These task forces aim to bridge the divide between the right wing of the Democratic party, represented by Biden, and the left wing of the party, represented by Sanders.  On May 13, Biden and Sanders announced that the six task forces would be co-chaired by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, former Secretary of State John Kerry, Rep. Pramila Jayapal, former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, NILC director Marielena Hincapi\u00e9, Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, AFA president Sara Nelson, Rep. Karen Bass, civil rights attorney Chiraag Bains, Rep. Bobby Scott, Dr. Heather Gautney, and Rep. Marcia Fudge.  Six task forces were formed, each with members representing each candidate, covering climate change, criminal justice reform, the economy, education, health care, and immigration. The final report was released on July 8, 2020, and is expected to form the basis of the 2020 Democratic presidential platform. The six groups were coordinated by Analilia Mejia, political director to the Sanders primary campaign, and Carmel Martin, an advisor to Biden.  (Italics denotes the Chair of a committee)  Unity Task Force on Climate Change  John Kerry  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez  Kathy Castor   Kerry Duggan   Catherine Coleman Flowers   Conor Lamb   Gina McCarthy   Donald McEachin   Varshini Prakash  Unity Task Force on Criminal Justice Reform  Chiraag Bains   Bobby Scott  Raumesh Akbari  Justin Bamberg   Vanita Gupta   Eric Holder  Symone Sanders   Stacey Walker  Unity Task Force on the Economy  Karen Bass   Sara Nelson  Jared Bernstein   Darrick Hamilton   Ben Harris   Stephanie Kelton   Lee Saunders   Sonal Shah  Unity Task Force on Education  Marcia Fudge  Heather Gautney  Alejandro Adler   Lily Eskelsen Garcia   Maggie Thompson   Christie Vilsack   Randi Weingarten   Hirokazu Yoshikawa  Unity Task Force on Health Care  Pramila Jayapal   Vivek Murthy   Donald Berwick   Abdul El-Sayed   Sherry Glied   Mary Kay Henry   Chris Jennings  Robin Kelly  Unity Task Force on Immigration  Lucille Roybal-Allard  Marielena Hincapi\u00e9   Crist\u00f3bal Alex   Veronica Escobar   Marisa Franco   Juan Gonzalez   Kate Marshall   Javier Vald\u00e9s  Outcomes of the task forces By June 9, Biden had enough delegates to secure his nomination as the Democratic candidate. On July 8, Biden's campaign released a set of policy recommendations adopted by the Unity Task Forces appointed by him and Bernie Sanders. The recommendations focus on climate change, criminal justice, the economy, education, health care, and immigration.  Kanye West On July 4, musician and entrepreneur Kanye West announced his campaign for the presidency. The Los Angeles Times wrote that this \"might be part of an effort to draw Black supporters away from Biden to help Trump.\"  Accepting the nomination  On August 5, it was reported that Biden would accept the Democratic nomination from his home state of Delaware due to the pandemic. On August 11, he announced that Kamala Harris would be his running mate. The next day, the two made their first public appearance together promoting their mutual campaigns. On August 18, the second night of the 2020 Democratic National Convention, the party officially nominated Biden, making him the first non-incumbent vice president to be nominated for president since Walter Mondale in 1984. Biden accepted the nomination two nights later. Chris Wallace of Fox News Sunday called Biden's acceptance speech \"enormously effective\" and said he \"blew a big hole\" in Trump's characterization of the candidate as being \"mentally shot.\" During the convention, delegates adopted the party platform, which was drafted by a committee of many of the same people from the unity task forces and based on the recommendations issued by those task forces.  Presidential debates  Since Biden's successful nomination in the Democratic primaries Trump attempted to cast doubt over Biden's abilities, claiming that he was suffering from dementia and that he was taking performance-enhancing drugs in the primaries. Trump called for Biden to be drug tested before the presidential debate; Biden declined. Trump also claimed that Biden would use a hidden electronic earpiece for the debate, demanding that Biden's ears be searched. Again, Biden declined.  The first debate took place at Cleveland Clinic on September 29. It was moderated by Chris Wallace. Debate topics included Trump's and Biden's records, the economy, the COVID-19 pandemic, race relations, and the Supreme Court nomination of Amy Coney Barrett. Each speaker was to have two minutes to state their positions followed with a period of discussion. The debate quickly devolved into cross talk and interruptions and was widely criticized as being a low point in U.S. presidential politics. Although Wallace pleaded multiple times with Trump to follow the agreed-upon debate rules, Trump frequently interrupted and spoke over Biden and at times with Wallace as well. Following the debate Wallace stated that while his own family and the Biden family wore masks as had been required for those in attendance, the Trump family did not and refused the masks offered to them by Cleveland Clinic staffers.  The vice presidential debate between Harris and Pence took place as scheduled on October 7 with Susan Page serving as moderator. The debate was generally seen as civil although there were frequent instances of both candidates interrupting while the other was speaking, with Harris interrupting only about half as often as Pence. Pence also repeatedly spoke beyond his allotted time, ignoring Page's attempts of asking him to mind the two-minute time limits. A CNN poll of registered voters found that 59% felt Harris had won, while 38% felt Pence to be the winner.  The second debate was scheduled to take place on October 15, but was cancelled in light of the White House COVID-19 outbreak and Trump's declared intention not to participate in a virtual debate. In response to Trump's refusal to debate Biden scheduled a town hall on ABC for October 15; Trump then scheduled a town hall as well, on the same date and at the same time, to be broadcast on NBC, MSNBC, and CNBC. According to Nielsen ratings, nearly 700,000 more viewers watched Biden's town hall than those who watched Trump's, even though Trump appeared on three outlets.  The final debate took place on Thursday, October 22, 2020, from 9:00\u00a0p.m. to 10:30\u00a0p.m. EDT, at the Curb Event Center in Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee, with Kristen Welker of NBC moderating. While it was originally planned to be the third debate, it was the second due to the cancellation of the October 15 debate. The topics covered included: fighting the current COVID-19 pandemic, American families, racial issues, climate change, national security, and leadership. The debate rules were similar to the first, but due to President Trump's repeated interruptions in the prior debate, each candidates microphones would be muted when it was not their turn to talk. This debate was considered to be drastically less hostile and much more informative, but both candidates still made several false or misleading claims. A post-debate CNN/SSRS poll found that 53% of debate-viewers thought that Biden had won and 39% thought Trump had won, with a margin of error of 5.7 points.  Final month  On October 6, Biden made a campaign speech in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, called \"the best of his campaign\" by CNN's John Avlon.  On October 15, both Biden and Trump held separate town hall speeches, replacing the cancelled second debate.  On October 22, Biden and Trump participated in a second and final debate in Nashville, Tennessee. In contrast to the first debate, the microphones of both candidates were muted at select times. Trump pressed Biden on renewed allegations that during his time as vice president, members of his family had personally profited from his position in Ukraine and China; Biden denied any misconduct and pointed out controversies involving Trump and those countries. Trump repeatedly asked why Biden had not delivered on his 2020 campaign promises during his eight years in the White House, to which Biden responded, \"we had a Republican Congress.\"  Texas bus incident  On October 31, 2020, a Joe Biden campaign bus was harassed by several drivers while traveling from San Antonio to Austin, Texas along Interstate 35. The bus, which carried former State Senator Wendy Davis and several campaign staffers, was followed along the interstate by several cars, including many flying Donald Trump flags. After the incident, the Biden campaign cancelled two planned events in Austin, Texas.   The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) launched an investigation into the incident. Trump subsequently criticized the FBI's decision at a rally. He later tweeted, \"In my opinion, these patriots did nothing wrong. Instead, the FBI & Justice should be investigating the terrorists, anarchists, and agitators of ANTIFA, who run around burning down our Democrat run cities and hurting our people!\"  Election Day and beyond   The election was held on November 3. On November 6, election-calling organization Decision Desk HQ forecast that Biden had won the election based on its forecast that Biden had won Pennsylvania; this result coupled with Biden's other projected state wins would grant him over 270 electoral college votes.  By November 7, news organizations ABC News, Associated Press, CBS News, CNN, Fox News, NBC News, Reuters, and the New York Times all forecast that Biden had won the election.  As of December 27, Joe Biden has received 81,283,098 votes to Donald Trump's 74,222,958 votes, or 51.3% to 46.8%. In addition, Biden has won 306 electoral college votes to Trump's 232, exactly the same margins as the 2016 election, which Donald Trump had repeatedly called a \"landslide victory\". Biden broke the record for most votes cast during an election in the history of the United States, while Trump received the most votes ever for a sitting president.  On December 9, every state had certified their election results, with West Virginia being the last state to do so. On Monday December 14, the Electoral College voted to elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris President and Vice President-Elect, affirming what was projected to happen on November 6 and 7. After a chaotic attack on the Capitol, lawmakers met on January 6 and counted the electoral votes submitted by the states, finally ensuring that Joe Biden would take office on January 20.  During and after the election, Donald Trump and his allies have repeatedly claimed that there was significant fraud in this election, often with little or no evidence. Because of this, Trump and his lawyers have called for swing state officials to overturn the results, frequently drawing criticism for their inflammatory and violent remarks. He has filed more than 50 lawsuits challenging the results in several different swing states, but almost all have been lost. Notably, a major lawsuit challenging the vote in 6 different swing states was unanimously rejected by the conservative majority Supreme Court. In a last ditch attempt at overturning the election, several Republican members of the House and Senate objected to the January 6 certification of the Electoral College, but after a long night of deliberation, Mike Pence certified the results for Joe Biden, much to the ire of Donald Trump. That same day, a violent group of Trump supporters broke into the United States Capitol while Congress was counting the votes in an attempt to halt or slow the proceedings. They were not successful in stopping the count, though they did manage to delay the certification by a few hours.  Polling  Opinion polls conducted in 2020 generally showed Biden leading Trump nationally in general election matchups, with the former vice president's advantage often extending beyond that of the survey's margin of sampling error.  On July 4, Politico reported that Biden was leading Trump \"by double digits in recent polls\". In late July, a Washington Post\u2013ABC News poll showed Biden's double-digit lead holding. A national poll conducted in early August showed Biden leading by three percent. An Iowa poll showed Trump leading Biden by 48% to 45%, which is six percentage points less than Trump won the state with in 2016.  Three national polls released August 13\u201317 show Biden polling ahead of Trump: Fox News has him leading Trump 49%\u201342%, NBC/Wall Street Journal has him leading 50%\u201341%, and Washington Post/ABC News has him 53%\u201341%. A Pew Research Center showed similar results, but found that a majority of participants believed that Trump would win. A Washington Post/ABC News poll taken in late September showed Biden and Harris's lead to be 53%\u201343%.  A NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll conducted September 30 \u2013 October 1 (after the presidential debate, but before Trump's announcement of his COVID-19 diagnosis) has Biden leading 53%\u201339%. On October 7, a CNN poll showed Biden leading 57%\u201341%, and a week later, Opinium Research/The Guardian showed him leading 57%\u201340%. As of October 13, Biden consistently led in poll averages by several or more points for over 100 days, as compared to the last four presidential elections. Biden led 54%\u201342% in a CNN poll of October 28; its polling director pointed out that:Although the election will ultimately be decided by the statewide results, which drive the Electoral College, Biden's lead nationally is wider than any presidential candidate has held in more than two decades in the final days of the campaign.  Odds of winning  In late September, FiveThirtyEight put Biden's odds of winning at nearly 77% and specifically predicted that he would win 352 electoral votes. His popularity rose in early October and, by October 13, FiveThirtyEight had increased its odds of Biden winning the election to 87%. This calculation remained the same through October 26, when it began to rise again, reaching 90% on October 30.  Allegations of inappropriate physical contact  Biden has been accused several times of inappropriate non-sexual contact, such as embracing, kissing, and other forms of physical contact. He has described himself as a \"tactile politician\" and admitted this behavior has caused trouble for him in the past. By 2015, a series of swearings-in and other events at which Biden had placed his hands on people and talked closely to them, attracted attention both in the press and on social media. Various people defended Biden, including a senator who issued a statement, as well as Stephanie Carter, a woman whose photograph with Biden had gone viral, who described the photo as \"misleadingly extracted from what was a longer moment between close friends\". In February 2016, Biden gave a speech about sexual assault awareness at the 88th Academy Awards, before introducing Lady Gaga.  In March 2019, former Nevada assemblywoman Lucy Flores alleged that Biden had touched her without her consent at a 2014 campaign rally in Las Vegas. In an op-ed, Flores wrote that Biden had walked up behind her, put his hands on her shoulders, smelled her hair, and kissed the back of her head, adding that the way he touched her was \"an intimate way reserved for close friends, family, or romantic partners\u2014and I felt powerless to do anything about it.\" Biden's spokesman said Biden did not recall the behavior described. Two days later, Amy Lappos, a former congressional aide to Jim Himes, said Biden touched her in a non-sexual but inappropriate way by holding her head to rub noses with her at a political fundraiser in Greenwich in 2009. The next day, two more women came forward with allegations of unwanted touching claiming that he touched a woman's leg during a meeting, and that he placed his hand on a woman's back during a photo.  In early April 2019, three women told The Washington Post Biden had touched them in ways that made them feel uncomfortable. Also in April 2019, former Biden staffer Tara Reade said she had felt uncomfortable on several occasions when Biden touched her on her shoulder and neck during her employment in his Senate office in 1993. In March 2020, Reade accused him of a 1993 sexual assault. There were inconsistences between Reade's 2019 and 2020 allegations. Biden and his campaign vehemently denied the allegation. The New York Times investigated and \"found no pattern of sexual misconduct by Mr. Biden\".  Biden apologized for not understanding how people would react to his actions, but said his intentions were honorable and that he would be more \"mindful of people's personal space\". He went on to say he was not sorry for anything he had ever done, which led critics to accuse him of sending a mixed message. Arwa Mahdawi of The Guardian said it was \"frustrating to see conservatives... weaponize the accusations against Biden\", but that it was \"also frustrating to see so many liberals turn a blind eye\".  Endorsements  As tracked by FiveThirtyEight, Biden received the most support from prominent members of the Democratic Party out of all Democratic candidates in the 2020 presidential election after many settled for Biden, Bernie popularity was dropping in the polls, and many wanted Joe Biden rather than Bernie Sanders. Biden received endorsements from 12 former candidates in the 2020 race, including Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, Michael Bloomberg, Tulsi Gabbard, Amy Klobuchar, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Beto O'Rourke, Andrew Yang, and others. On April 14, 2020, after Biden was the only remaining major candidate for the Democratic nomination, former president Barack Obama (under whom Biden served as vice president) endorsed him. On April 27, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi endorsed him. On April 28, Biden received the endorsement of former 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, whose election loss had inspired his 2020 candidacy.  Biden increasingly attracted Republican support away from their party's incumbent leader, Donald Trump. On August 17, an ad from Republican Voters Against Trump aired featuring Miles Taylor, former chief of staff to former homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. Taylor concludes in the ad, \"Given what I experienced in the [Trump] administration, I have to support Joe Biden for president.\" In late August, a movement called Republicans for Biden was launched with sponsorship by 25 former Republican congresspeople, and Politico reported that \"Several dozen former staffers from Sen. Mitt Romney's (R-Utah) presidential campaign, the George W. Bush administration and the campaign and Senate staff of former Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) have signed on to an effort to elect Joe Biden.\" By early September, over 175 current and former law enforcement officials had endorsed Biden.  In September 2020, Scientific American announced its endorsement of Biden for president. This was the first time the magazine had endorsed a presidential candidate in the almost 200 years that it has been in print. The magazine's endorsement read:  The evidence and the science show that Donald Trump has badly damaged the U.S. and its people\u2014because he rejects evidence and science. The most devastating example is his dishonest and inept response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which cost more than 190,000 Americans their lives by the middle of September. He has also attacked environmental protections, medical care, and the researchers and public science agencies that help this country prepare for its greatest challenges. That is why we urge you to vote for Joe Biden, who is offering fact-based plans to protect our health, our economy and the environment. These and other proposals he has put forth can set the country back on course for a safer, more prosperous and more equitable future.  In October, the New England Journal of Medicine, the oldest and considered to be the world's most prestigious medical journal, published an editorial which condemned the Trump administration's handling of the coronavirus pandemic saying that \"they have taken a crisis and turned it into a tragedy.\" This is the first time in the journal's history that they have supported or condemned a political candidate. A week later, the science journal Nature also endorsed Biden.  In October, 780 retired generals, admirals, senior noncommissioned officers, ambassadors and senior national security officials signed a letter endorsing Biden.  On October 25, the conservative-leaning New Hampshire Union Leader endorsed Biden, the first Democratic presidential candidate the paper had endorsed in over 100 years.  Political positions  Although generally referred to as a moderate, Biden has declared himself as the candidate with the most progressive record.  Abortion On May 21, 2019, a Biden campaign aide told the Associated Press that Biden would support immediate federal legislation codifying Roe v. Wade into statute. On June 5, 2019, the Biden campaign confirmed to NBC News that Biden still supports the Hyde Amendment, something no other Democratic presidential candidate came out in support of. Biden's campaign also told NBC News that Biden would be open to repealing the Hyde Amendment if abortion access protections currently under Roe v. Wade were threatened. On June 6, 2019, Biden, at the Democratic National Committee's African American Leadership Council Summit in Atlanta, Georgia, said he now supports repealing the Hyde Amendment, crediting his change in position, in part, to recent efforts by Republicans passing anti-abortion state laws, which he called \"extreme laws\". Also at the summit, he focused on economic inequality for African Americans, education access, criminal justice reform, healthcare, and voter suppression in the south.  Cannabis Biden supports the decriminalization, but not legalization, of recreational cannabis usage. Biden said he believes no one should be in jail because of cannabis use. As president, he would decriminalize cannabis use and automatically expunge prior convictions. He supports the legalization of cannabis for medical purposes, leaving decisions regarding legalization for recreational use up to the states, and recategorizing cannabis as a Schedule II drug so researchers can study its impacts. Every other Democratic presidential candidate supported the full federal legalization of cannabis, with the exception of Michael Bloomberg, Steve Bullock and Joe Sestak.  Capital punishment On June 20, 2019, following the first federal death sentence since 2003, Biden came out against capital punishment, supporting the repeal of both federal- and state-level death sentence statutes. He argued that with the death penalty, there is a risk of executing a wrongfully convicted person. Biden had previously supported capital punishment.  Education  In 2018, Biden said he supported a universal pre-kindergarten program. He unveiled a higher education plan in October 2019, which includes two years of guaranteed free community college or other training, and cuts to student loan obligations. Unlike some of his rivals, he initially did not support four years of free college tuition, but later reversed this for students of families whose income is less than $125,000, as well as allowing student loan debts to default during bankruptcy.  Although the Obama administration promoted charter schools, Biden criticized some charter schools for funneling money away from public schools in a May 2019 speech, and said that he opposes federal funds for-profit charter schools.  Environment On June 4, 2019, the Biden campaign released a $1.7 trillion climate plan that embraced the framework of the Green New Deal. The plan called for the US to reach net zero emissions by 2050 or earlier, and help coal workers to transition into jobs created from a clean-energy economy. Biden supports the development of carbon capture and storage and small modular reactors to reduce emissions. On September 4, 2019, during a CNN climate change town hall, Biden said he does not support banning fracking for natural gas, distancing himself from some of his Democratic presidential rivals, but said he would ban new fracking permits and evaluate existing ones to determine their safety.  Health On July 16, 2019, Biden called for additional funding to construct rural hospitals, increase telehealth services in rural communities, and provide incentives for doctors to practice in rural areas, also known as medical deserts in the United States.  On April 29, 2019, Biden came out in favor of a public option for health insurance and outlawing non-compete clauses for low-wage workers.  Immigration On July 5, 2019, Biden told CNN he did not support decriminalizing illegal entry into the United States, a position that puts him at odds with many of his 2020 Democratic rivals. He released a plan to reform the immigration system in December 2019, which includes a reversal of the Trump administration's deportation policies, a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, and expansions in work visas and refugee admissions.  Infrastructure Biden released his infrastructure plan on November 14, 2019, calling for investments of $1.3 trillion on infrastructure overhaul. The plan involves investments in the restoration of roads, bridges and highways, encouraging greater adoption of rail transport and electric vehicles. It also includes water pipe replacements, increases in broadband coverage, and updates to schools.  LGBTQ issues On June 1, 2019, Biden gave a keynote address to hundreds of activists and donors at the Human Rights Campaign's annual Ohio gala. He declared his top legislative priority was passing the Equality Act. He attacked Donald Trump for banning transgender troops in the U.S. military, allowing individuals in the medical field to deny treating LGBTQ individuals, and allowing homeless shelters to deny transgender occupants.  Race relations While at a fundraiser on June 18, 2019, Biden said one of his greatest strengths was \"bringing people together\" and pointed to his relationships with senators James Eastland and Herman Talmadge, two segregationists, as examples. While imitating a Southern drawl, Biden remarked \"I was in a caucus with James O. Eastland. He never called me 'boy', he always called me 'son'.\" Biden's Democratic opponents criticized the remarks, specifically the use of the word \"boy\". In response, Biden said that he was not meaning to use the term \"boy\" in its derogatory racial context.  During the first Democratic presidential debate, Kamala Harris criticized Biden for his comments regarding his past work with segregationist senators and his past opposition to desegregation busing, which had allowed black children like her to attend integrated schools. Biden was widely criticized for his debate performance and support for him dropped 10 points. President Trump defended Biden, saying Harris was given \"too much credit\" for her debate with Biden.  In May 2020, during an interview on The Breakfast Club radio show that CBS News described as \"contentious\", Biden remarked \"If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black.\" He later apologized for his remarks.  Welfare On June 17, 2019, Biden appeared at the \"Poor People's Campaign Presidential Forum\" in Washington, D.C., to discuss proposals for the funding of poverty alleviation programs. At a fundraiser in New York the next day, While on the topic of raising wealthy donor's taxes to get his legislative goals passed, he reassured wealthy donors that he would not \"demonize\" the rich and said, \"no one's standard of living will change, nothing would fundamentally change.\"  Trump\u2013Ukraine scandal  In 2019, Trump allegedly attempted to coerce Ukraine and other foreign countries to investigate Joe Biden's son Hunter. Trump enlisted surrogates within and outside his official administration, including his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr, to pressure Ukraine and other foreign governments to cooperate in supporting conspiracy theories concerning American politics. Trump blocked but later released payment of a congressionally mandated $391 million military aid package to allegedly obtain quid pro quo cooperation from Volodymyr Zelensky, the President of Ukraine. A number of contacts were established between the White House and the government of Ukraine, culminating in a phone call between Trump and Zelensky on July 25, 2019.  The scandal resulted in Trump's impeachment on charges of abusing the power of his office and obstructing Congress, and his ultimate acquittal by the Senate. At the time, no evidence had been produced of any wrongdoing by the Bidens.  In October 2019, CNN refused to run an ad for the Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign, saying it includes false claims against Biden. Fox News refused to stop airing a Trump campaign ad that allegedly lied about Biden after his campaign asked them to stop running the ad.  On October 14, 2020, the New York Post ran a story showing a screenshot of an alleged email from a top adviser to Ukrainian energy company Burisma to Biden's son Hunter, thanking him for the supposed opportunity to meet his father. The article alleges that this supports claims that Biden used his political power to benefit his son Hunter in business dealings with Ukraine. The Post's source was Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who says he got the data from the hard drive of a laptop allegedly dropped off at a repair shop in April 2019. The shop owner, John Mac Isaac, said he initially turned the laptop over to the FBI and later shared a copy of the data with Giuliani. CBS reported that they held a lengthy interview with Mac Isaac in which he frequently contradicted himself, \"raising questions about [his] truthfulness.\" Social media platforms swiftly responded by controlling how the article could be shared\u2014Facebook by including a fact-checking statement and Twitter by preventing links to the story on the basis of its containing hacked material. Republican politicians accused these platforms of censorship, renewing calls for reform of Section 230. Trump suggested that disclosures in the emails should disqualify Biden from the presidency. Biden's campaign and those associated with him portrayed the article's allegations as false, saying that no such meeting ever happened. Former U.S. intelligence officials warned the White House in 2019 that Giuliani could be the target of a Russian intelligence operation.  United States intelligence community analysis released in March 2021 stated that proxies of Russian intelligence promoted and laundered misleading or unsubstantiated narratives about the Bidens \"to US media organizations, US officials, and prominent US individuals, including some close to former President Trump and his administration.\"  A June 2021 PolitiFact fact-check stated that \"over time, there has been less doubt that the laptop did in fact belong to Hunter Biden\", although concluded that \"[n]othing from the laptop has revealed illegal or unethical behavior by Joe Biden as vice president with regard to his son\u2019s tenure as a director for Burisma\". In an opinion article, Holman W. Jenkins Jr. of The Wall Street Journal criticized other journalists regarding the laptop, for \"ignoring a story you know to be true in hopes your readers will believe it's not true\" Glenn Kessler of The Washington Post analyzed a claim, purportedly from emails of the laptop, that Joe Biden met with Burisma executive Vadym Pozharskyi at a dinner in April 2015. Kessler concluded that Joe Biden had briefly dropped by the dinner to speak to his longtime Greek friend, Alex Karloutsos, without participating in the dinner; additionally, while the attendees list included the name \"Vadym\", no last name was specified.

After initially deciding not to run for president in 2019, Biden announced his candidacy for the 2020 Democratic nomination on April 19, 2019, at a rally in Philadelphia. According to The New York Times, the launch of his campaign represented a significant moment in the Democratic Party's history, as the three leading candidates for the nomination, Biden, Bernie Sanders, and Elizabeth Warren, were all septuagenarians. Biden's campaign was not supported by any Super PACs, and he was considered the frontrunner for the nomination among many in the party. However, he faced criticism for his decades-old stances on crime, the1994 crime bill, and his relationship with lobbyists and corporate PACs. In 2019, Biden was the subject of an FBI investigation regarding his involvement with his son's business dealings in Ukraine and China. Biden was one of the first major candidates to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, as he suspended his campaign activities on March 12, 2020, three days after the pandemic was declared. While he remained active on the campaign trail, other candidates such as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren suspended their campaigns due to the pandemic. Biden won the 2020 Democratic nomination after defeating his remaining opponent, Bernie Sanders, in the 2020 Democratic National Convention, and went on to challenge Republican nominee and incumbent President Donald Trump in the 2020 United States presidential election. He selected California Senator Kamala Harris as his vice presidential running mate. Biden and Harris won the election, defeating Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Lolium perenne\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Lolium perenne, common name perennial ryegrass, English ryegrass, winter ryegrass, or ray grass, is a grass from the family Poaceae. It is native to Europe, Asia and northern Africa, but is widely cultivated and naturalised around the world.  Description  The plant is a low-growing, tufted, hairless grass, with a bunching (or tillering) growth habit. The leaves are dark green, smooth and glossy on the lower surface, with untoothed parallel sides and prominent parallel veins on the upper surface. The leaves are folded lengthwise in bud (unlike the rolled leaves of Italian ryegrass, Lolium multiflorum) with a strong central keel, giving a flattened appearance. The ligule is very short and truncated and often difficult to see. The small white auricles grip the stem at the base of the leaf blade. Leaf sheaths at the base are usually tinged pink and hairless. Stems grow up to 90\u00a0cm.  The inflorescence is unbranched, with spikelets on alternating sides edgeways-on to the stem. Each spikelet has only a single glume, on the side away from the stem, and  between four and 14 florets without awns, unlike Italian ryegrass. The anthers are pale yellow, and the plant flowers from May to November. Perennial ryegrass has a fibrous root system, with thick main roots and thinner lateral branches. Roots are usually arbuscular mycorrhizal.  Distribution Perennial ryegrass is native to southern Europe, the Middle East, North Africa and eastwards to central Asia. As a useful species of grass for fodder and grazing livestock, it has been taken by farmers settling in new areas including North America, South Africa and Australia. It can be used to prevent erosion and to stabilise soils, as well as creating a hardwearing turf for lawns and golf courses. With its great ability to set seed, its ease of germination and vigour, it has spread from the fields where it has been planted to roadsides, trackways, footpaths, wasteland, river banks and sand dunes. In countries where it has been introduced, it may be regarded as an invasive species that competes with native plants.  Cultivation and uses Perennial ryegrass is an important pasture and forage plant, and is used in many pasture seed mixes. In fertile soil, it produces a high grass yield, and in Britain and Ireland, it is frequently sown for short-term ley grassland, often with red or white clover (Trifolium).  In Britain, it is also used as an indicator of nonspecies-rich grassland, as it outcompetes the rarer plants and grasses, especially in fertile soils. Agri-environment schemes such as the Countryside Stewardship Scheme, Environmentally Sensitive Areas Scheme, and Environmental Stewardship give funding to species-rich grasslands that do not have an abundance of ryegrass.  Selected seed mixes are used extensively for sports pitches, especially winter sports in temperate climates, because of its wear resistance and ability to regenerate.    It is commonly used in the southwest United States to overseed winter lawns. Bermudagrass is a typical summertime grass in states such as Arizona, since it is able to withstand the high temperatures. However, bermudagrass goes dormant during the cooler winter months.  Rather than have brown lawns, many homeowners, public areas, and golf courses overseed these lawns with perennial ryegrass in early to mid-September.  It is also the grass used on the courts at the All England Lawn Tennis Club in Wimbledon. Since 2001, the courts have been sown with 100% perennial ryegrass to \"improve durability and strengthen the sward to withstand better the increasing wear of the modern game\".

Its stem is also round rather than folded.  Couch, Elymus repens, has spikelets set on the broadside of the stem rather than edge on.

It is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, but has become naturalized in the Americas. Lolium perenne is a widespread species used in lawns and for fodder. A common weed, it is often considered a nuisance species. Lolium perenne is a perennial grass with a tough wiry stem that can reach a height of 1.5 metres (5 ft). The stem is generally unbranched, but may have a few short branches. The spikelets are generally ovate or oblong, 2\u20133 mm (0.079\u20130.118 in) long, with three to seven florets.

It took a Left Republican position, although it was never an official socialist organ.  In the years before World War I (1914\u201318) many prominent politicians contributed to the paper. The paper opposed the pact between Germany and Russia just before World War II (1939\u201345), and after the fall of France opposed the Vichy regime. However, it managed to continue publication until 1944.  History  Le Petit Proven\u00e7al was founded in Marseille in 1880, and distributed in south eastern France. It was originally titled La Jeune r\u00e9publique (The Young Republic). The founder was Geoffroy Velten (1831\u20131915), also called Godfried Velten, a Protestant entrepreneur and militant Republican who became a Municipal Councillor in Marseilles in 1880, and on 25 January 1883 was made Senator for Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne. Velten also founded L'\u00c9galit\u00e9. The paper competed with others such as Le Petit Marseillais, Le Radical and Le Soleil du Midi. At first the newspaper published opinions and polemics, but later it became a source of news and information. Thus, during the campaign in Madagascar, from September 1894 to December 1896 Le Petit Proven\u00e7al devoted 95 editorials or feature articles on the front page to colonial issues.  Le Petit Proven\u00e7al paper called itself a Socialist Republican newspaper, but was never the official organ of the socialists. Between 1890 and 1900 it supported socialist candidates of all camps, including Guesdists. Regular contributors included Alexandre Millerand, Ren\u00e9 Viviani, Gustave Rouanet, Clovis Hugues and L\u00e9on Mirman. Andr\u00e9 Joseph Lef\u00e8vre wrote for Le Petit Proven\u00e7al in the period before World War I (1914\u201318). During the period leading up to 1914 the paper emphasized that it supported both radicals and socialists. The circulation was 40,000\u201350,000 in 1902. While papers at the time usually gave false circulation figures  Le Petit Proven\u00e7al by 1913 probably had a daily circulation of about 100,000. Advertising only filled 20% or so of the pages.  By 1914 Le Petit Proven\u00e7al had a circulation of 100,000\u2013110,000 in 1914, mostly among the working-class people of Marseilles, although it also sold in the rural parts of the department and in the center of the city, where it faced fierce competition from Le Petit Marseillais. Le Petit Proven\u00e7al continued to take a socialist position after World War I. After the war the socialist Marcel D\u00e9at contributed to the newspaper. Le Petit Proven\u00e7al became the regional organ of the Left.  On 29 August 1939, on the eve of World War II (1939\u201345), Le Petit Proven\u00e7al called for support for the administrative commission of the Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du travail (General Confederation of Labor), which had condemned the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact between the USSR and Germany.  On 18 June 1940 Le Petit Provencal and Le Petit Marseillais both published an appeal from General Charles de Gaulle in its entirety. Shortly after the Vichy government of Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain had been established the newspaper published an article on 18 July 1940 that listed all that had been achieved by the French Third Republic since the 1875 constitution was established. It concluded with the words, \"Vive la libert\u00e9! Vive la R\u00e9publique!\" American films were banned after the Germans arrived in Marseilles.  L\u00e9on Bancal was jailed for an article Adieu \u00e1 Mickey in Le Petit Proven\u00e7al. The newspaper was closed in 1944.

It was premiered on 18 April 1845 at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique in Paris. The opera is set in the south of France, in and around Marseille. The story concerns a young man, Vincent, who is in love with a girl, Henriette, but is prevented from marrying her by his father, who prefers that he marry the much wealthier Catherine. Vincent is eventually permitted to marry Henriette, but on condition that he gives up his right to his inheritance. He agrees, but his father tricks him into signing a document that not only relinquishes his inheritance but also makes him ineligible to marry Henriette. The young man is heartbroken, but his pain is eased when his father's lawyer reveals that the signature on the document is a forgery. The father is exposed as a fraud and the young couple are free to marry. The opera was an immediate success, and was quickly revived in Paris and toured widely. Its title, \"Le Petit Proven\u00e7al\", refers to the character of Vincent, who is from Provence, and is therefore called \"le petit proven\u00e7al\" (the little Proven\u00e7al). The opera's most famous number is the barcarolle-like \"Amour, viens aider ma faiblesse\", in which the three female characters urge love to help Vincent in his hour of need.

Initially the road through the park was , with visitors driving past lions, cheetahs, monkeys, giraffes, zebra, elephants and various antelope. Due to the popularity of this route, an additional  of road was added in 1973, and camels, buffalo, white rhino, and tigers were added to the park. Over the years, a few modifications have been made. For instance, tigers are now displayed in enclosures within the reserve, and a bypass around the baboons was built for visitors who are worried about damage to their cars.

The RAF airbase situated at the safari park was also known as No 49 SLG or RAF Knowsley Park and was in use between 13 May 1942 \u2013 November 1944.  The park has hosted several sporting events including the Olympic torch relay, watched by 6,000 children and families in June 2012. The park hosted the finish of Stage Two of the 2012 Tour of Britain cycling event and hosted Stage Three of the 2013 Tour in September of that year.  Zoological collection Situated around Knowsley Hall on the ancestral estate of the Earl of Derby, the reserve is home to different animals.

Baboons The park is open to the public and customers drive around the park in their own vehicles. There is a bypass route past the baboons for those who wish to avoid the risk of the baboons damaging their cars. In 2009 the baboons made the news all over the world when a video was released showing how they were intelligent and curious enough to open car roofboxes.  Tiger Trail  Amur Tiger Trail opened 25 May 2018, home to the Amur Tiger otherwise known as the Siberian Tiger. The area is 10,000m2 and includes forested areas, natural streams and ponds.

The exhibit also houses the 'Equatorial Express', a small train which visitors can ride to gain a unique viewpoint of the animals. 4 animal species are housed in this exhibit, the South American tapir, Sitatunga, Rhea and the Capybara.  African Elephant  Until 2017 the park housed a herd of 4 adult cows named Tana, Ashanti, Nala and Juba. They were transported to Zoo Parc d'Beauval, France to enter the European Breeding Programme and allow for transformations on Knowsley Safari's Foot Safari. Knowsley previously housed a bull named Nissim, who collapsed in June 2014. Knowsley also recently lost their cow named Shaba due to a long battle with elephant arthritis.  Southern White Rhinoceros  Knowsley's crash of 11 adult rhinos is one of the most successful and genetically diverse breeding groups in Europe. The latest calf (as at 4 June 2016), Nomvula (Mother of Rain \u2013 a reference to the recent wet weather), born to mum Meru and is the 19th to be born at the facility in the last 40 years.

Born and raised in northern New Jersey, he moved to Philadelphia after graduating from college. After a successful career in Philadelphia real estate, he entered politics for the first time in 2015, being elected to the Philadelphia City Council.  Early life and education Domb was born in 1955 in Jersey City, New Jersey, the second son of Edward Domb and Betty Schlesinger Domb. Domb's father and grandfather worked in the embroidery business. The family relocated to nearby Fort Lee, New Jersey soon after Domb's birth. Domb and his older brother, Peter, embarked on a series of odd jobs from a young age, shining shoes, shoveling snow, and mowing lawns. He graduated from Fort Lee High School in 1973 and started college at American University in Washington, D.C. Domb took evening classes there and worked full-time selling security systems for Phelps Time Lock Service in Hyattsville, Maryland. He graduated in 1977 with a marketing degree and continued to work for Phelps, being transferred to Philadelphia to manage the company's office in that city.  Business career To earn extra money while managing the Phelps office, Domb earned a real estate license at Temple University. As the real estate business became more profitable, he quit the security business job and sold real estate full time, opening his own office in 1983. Domb specialized in real estate near Philadelphia's Rittenhouse Square and soon became well-known among property buyers and sellers in that neighborhood. He was elected president of the Greater Philadelphia Association of Realtors (GPAR) in 1990, the youngest president that organization had ever elected. After success in real estate sales, Domb expanded into real estate development in 1999, and worked with restaurateur Stephen Starr to develop restaurants in Philadelphia.  Domb was again elected president of the GPAR in 2013, by which time he had acquired the nickname \"Philly Condo King.\" In his second term as GPAR president, he worked with Mayor Michael Nutter and the city government on ideas to collect delinquent property taxes and attract new residents to the city. He also worked with City Council President Darrell L. Clarke to determine the market value and ultimate disposition of some of the city's inactive school buildings. Even after entering politics, Domb remained active in the real estate business, purchasing a 19-story office building in April 2016.  Political career Nutter was term-limited, so the office of mayor would be open in the 2015 election. Domb, a registered independent, was said to be \"testing the waters\" as a possibly independent or Republican candidate for mayor. Instead, in May of that year, Domb announced he would run as a Democrat for one of the city's seven at-large council seats. Pledging some of his vast personal wealth to the cause, Domb described his goals in office: \"We will talk about collecting taxes from out-of-state landlords and using that money to fund our schools. New job training programs. And partnering with our universities to mentor our children.\"  In the primary election that month, Domb placed third, winning one of the five Democratic nominations. In the general election in the majority-Democratic city, Domb again placed third, earning a seat on the council. In office, Domb continued to search for solution to the city's large number of tax-delinquent properties.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Prison rape\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Prison rape or jail rape is rape occurring in prison. The phrase is commonly used to describe rape of inmates by other inmates, less commonly to the rape of inmates by staff, and rarely to rape of staff by inmates.  Within the United States, the overwhelming majority of prison rape cases involve men who are raped by other men.  In some jurisdictions, sexual contact with inmates by prison staff is illegal, regardless of consent.  China  In February 2021, BBC News reported eyewitness accounts of systematic rape of Uyghur women in the Xinjiang internment camps.  Multiple women who were formerly detained in the Xinjiang internment camps have publicly made accusations of systemic sexual abuse, including rape. Sayragul Sauytbay, a teacher who was forced to work in the camps, told the BBC that employees of the camp in which she was detained conducted rapes en masse, saying that camp guards \"picked the girls and young women they wanted and took them away\". She also told the BBC of an organized gang rape, in which a woman around age 21 was forced to make a confession in front of a crowd of 100 other women detained in the camps, before being raped by multiple policemen in front of the assembled crowd. Tursunay Ziawudun, a woman who was detained in the camps for a period of nine months, told the BBC that women were removed from their cells \"every night\" to be raped by Chinese men, and that she was subjected to three separate instances of gang rape while detained. Qelbinur Sedik, an Uzbek woman from Xinjiang, has stated that Chinese police sexually abused detainees during electric shock tortures, saying that \"there were four kinds of electric shock... the chair, the glove, the helmet, and anal rape with a stick\".  Iran   Sexual violence against political prisoners is prevalent in Iran. It is allegedly ignored or even facilitated by authorities.  Reports issued to the United Nations allege that rape has been used by interrogators in Iran for decades. During the 1980s, following the Iranian Islamic Revolution, the rape of female political prisoners was so prevalent that it prompted Hussein-Ali Montazeri, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini's then-deputy, to write the following to Khomeini in a letter dated 7 October 1986: \"Did you know that young women are raped in some of the prisons of the Islamic Republic?\" Two prominent members of Iran's human rights community, the feminist lawyer and journalist Shadi Sadr and the blogger and activist Mojtaba Saminejad published essays online from inside Iran saying prison rape has a long history in the Islamic Republic.  In the 2009 Iranian presidential election protests, opposition groups reported thousands were arrested and tortured in prisons around the country, with former inmates alleging mass rape of men, women and children by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards, in prisons such as Kahrizak and Evin.  Following the 2009 presidential election, Iranian presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said several protesters held behind bars in Evin Prison had been savagely raped, according to a confidential letter to former president and cleric Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. Karroubi said this was a \"fragment\" of the evidence he had and that if the denials did not stop, he would release even more.  On 9 August 2009, in a letter to the Chairman of the Expediency Discernment Council of Iran, Mehdi Karroubi demanded investigation of Iranian prisons for possible torture and, in particular, sexual harassment of men and women. On 19 August, he wrote to parliament speaker Ali Larijani, asking to meet with him, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, judiciary chief Ayatollah Sadeq Larijani, former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and the state prosecutor to \"personally present my documents and evidence over the cases of sexual abuse in some prisons specially Kahrizak.\" Ali Larijani and Sadeq Larijani (Judiciary committee) both officially rejected his claims and Ali Khamenei's representatives, and Vice Chairman of National Security Commission of the parliament demanded Karroubi's arrest.  Turkey   Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have both released reports of widespread rape and abuse of prisoners in Turkey spanning multiple decades. Kurdish prisoners have also been specifically targeted for rape and other forms of sexual violence.  Middle East  Rape is regularly used in prisons across the wider Middle East. Sexual abuse of detained women, children and men is rampant in UAE, Saudi and Bahraini prisons.  United States   Public awareness of common prison rape is a relatively recent development, and estimates of its prevalence have varied widely for decades. In 1974, Carl Weiss and David James Friar wrote that 46 million Americans would one day be incarcerated; of that number, they held that 10 million would be raped.  A United States Department of Justice report, titled Sexual Victimization in Prisons and Jails Reported by Inmates, states that: \u201cIn 2011\u201312, an estimated 5.0% of state and federal prison inmates and 3.2% of jail inmates reported experiencing one or more incidents of sexual victimization by another inmate or facility staff in the past 12 months or since admission to the facility, if less than 12 months.\u201d However, advocates dispute the accuracy of the numbers, claiming they seem to under-report the real numbers of sexual assaults in prison\u2014especially among juveniles.  A 1992 estimate from the Federal Bureau of Prisons conjectured that between 9% and 20% of inmates had been sexually assaulted. Studies in 1982 and 1996 concluded that the rate was somewhere between 12% and 14%. A 1986 study by Daniel Lockwood put the number at around 23% for maximum security prisons in New York. In contrast, Christine Saum's 1994 survey of 101 inmates showed 5 had been sexually assaulted.  The Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003 was the first United States federal law passed specifically dealing with the sexual assault of prisoners. The bill was signed into law on 4 September 2003.

Prison rape is a problem in facilities around the world, and it is considered a major problem in the United States, where the rate of prison rape is much higher than in most other countries. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, in 2007, about 6.4% of state and federal prisoners were raped at least once during their time in prison, and about 3% to 4% were raped more than once. In 2007, about 1 in 5 prison rape victims were forced to have sex with another prisoner by a prison guard or other prison staff member. Prison rape is usually performed without the victim's consent and is an act of power and control. Most prison rape victims are male, but rape can also occur with female victims, and the victim can be any age. Although prison rape most often involves sexual intercourse, it can also involve other acts such as fondling or forced oral sex. There are many reasons prison rape occurs. A number of these explanations are similar to the reasons that people outside of prison commit rape. These include the sexual excitement of the attacker, a way to exert power and control over another person, a way to get revenge, and a way to get attention. Other reasons are specific to the prison environment. For example, prisons are populated by people who have little freedom to leave, are often lonely, and have a lot of idle time. These factors can increase the likelihood of prison rape. Prison rape can also be difficult to prevent in prison systems that are overpopulated and understaffed.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 21484134}

The Salvador Dal\u00ed Museum is said to be the world's most comprehensive collection of Dal\u00ed's works.  The year of their marriage the Morses began their long friendship with Dal\u00ed and on March 21, 1943, acquired their first Dal\u00ed work, Daddy Longlegs of the Evening - Hope!; early in April 1943 they acquired The Archaeological Reminiscence of Millet's \"Angelus\". Over time, becoming patrons of Dal\u00ed, the Morses acquired works by Dal\u00ed which they found both captivating and intriguing. Their absorption by the artist's work led Reynolds to author numerous studies of Dal\u00ed and his \u0153uvre and Eleanor to translate from French to English numerous books about Dal\u00ed and his \u0153uvre. In 1969, the Morses purchased The Hallucinogenic Toreador, before it was completed.  From 1971 to 1980, the Morses' considerable Dal\u00ed collection was on show in Beachwood, Ohio at the Salvador Dal\u00ed Museum, which was established there in a wing of their business premises. During that time the collection grew and required larger accommodation.  The Morses began the search for a new, permanent home for their collection. After seeing an article in the Wall Street Journal, \"U.S. Art World Dillydallies over Dal\u00ed\", St. Petersburg attorney James W. Martin persuaded local leaders to approach the Morses to choose St. Petersburg. With the financial support of the City of St. Petersburg and the State of Florida, the collection was housed in the Salvador Dal\u00ed Museum, formerly a warehouse on the waterfront, which opened in March 1982. A new, larger and more storm-secure museum near the current one, opened in 1-11-11 (at 11:11 am).  \"Sharing their knowledge and understanding of Salvador Dal\u00ed and his art has been a lifelong mission for this dedicated couple.\"  Personal life The Morses married in 1943. They had one son, Brad.  Reynolds Morse died on August 15, 2000, in Seminole, Florida, after a long illness. He was 85.  Reese Morse died on July 1, 2010, in St. Petersburg, Florida, of natural causes. She was 97.

Sick of the cold weather and lack of company, a talking yeti flees the Himalaya by grabbing onto the wheel of a passing aeroplane, landing in the white cliffs of Dover. While there, he meets a young girl called Betty, who befriends the yeti and adopts it as her pet. The subsequent strips followed the adventures of the yeti as he tried to adjust to city life.  Appearing in the comic throughout the year, the strip last appeared in issue 2698, dated 2 April 1994.  However, the strip appeared in the 1995 Beano Annual.  The strip was revived in issue 3784, dated 16 May 2015, now retitled Betty and the Yeti. This half-page version was drawn by Steve Beckett, and showed the Yeti befriending Betty over a comic at a campsite. He then stowed away in the luggage on the car roof as Betty and her father drove back to Beanotown. The Yeti himself looked identical to Robert Nixon's version, but Betty and her family were completely redesigned.

Anitha\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Shanmugam Anitha (5 March 2000 \u2013 1 September 2017) was a  student from Tamil Nadu, India. She scored 1176/1200 in the 12th standard exams in the Tamil Nadu State Board. This would have secured her a medical seat, if only the State Board marks had been considered for admission. In NEET-UG 2017, Anitha secured 12.33 percentage of marks while she scored 86 out of 720 marks. The minimum eligibility cut-off for making it into the merit list was 40 percentage for students in the reserved category.  The minimum eligibility cut-off for making it into the merit list was 40 percentage ( [107 to 130] out of 720 marks ) for students in the reserved category, while it was 50 percentage for general category ( [131 to 697] out of 720 marks ). Anitha scored 12.33 percentage while admission was 14.9 for reserved and 18.2 for general categories for 2018 admission.  Admission to medical colleges is based on NEET rank calculated by the percentage arrived at with the highest score and not on the marks obtained in NEET exam.  On 1 September 2017, she committed suicide by hanging. Her death created a major controversy in Tamil Nadu where the National Eligibility and Entrance Test for medical admissions was strongly opposed. She has become a cause celebre as a victim of the system.  Background Anitha  belonged  to a poor Dalit family in Kuzhumur village, Ariyalur district in rural Tamil Nadu. Anitha was the daughter of a daily wage labourer and her mother had died when she was young. She was brought up by her grandmother and lived in a house without even a toilet. She studied in a Tamil Medium school and was amongst the toppers in her district and she was the only student in Ariyalur district to score 100% marks in Physics and Mathematics in the 12th standard examination. Anitha always wanted to become a doctor. She saw that it was not possible for poor rural students to afford expensive coaching needed to prepare for NEET exams and only if medical admission selections were done based on the 12th standard marks alone would rural students be able to get seats. Anitha was unable to meet the cutoff and secure a seat through NEET.   Anitha was offered an aeronautical engineering course seat  at the Madras Institute of Technology  but as she only wanted to be a doctor she did not take up the offer. She would have been the first from her community in her village to become a doctor.  NEET court case The Tamil Nadu government  originally considered reserving 85% of the seats to Tamil Nadu State Board students. The Madras High Court dismissed it after an appeal.  Later  Tamil Nadu government had also promised exemption from National Eligibility and Entrance Test for one year. However the Supreme Court of India dismissed Tamil Nadu government's plea after the central government refused to support  Tamil Nadu's  ordinance seeking  exemption from NEET for one year.  Anitha implead herself in the petition in the Supreme Court against NEET claiming it was against the interests of rural students after a case was filed by Central Board of Secondary Education students represented by senior advocate Nalini Chidambaram, wife of P. Chidambaram, who argued that admissions should be made only on basis of NEET. After the Supreme Court of India verdict which stated that admissions should be made only based on NEET, Nalini Chidambaram stated, \"Any further appeal against NEET can only be done to God,\" and that the Tamil Nadu government could no longer do anything for State Board students after the Supreme Court verdict.  Anitha committed suicide by hanging herself nine days after the verdict.  Protest  Her suicide led  to protests all over Tamil Nadu  against NEET after her death. Anitha's family refused Tamil Nadu government's compensation offer. The large scale protests led to the Supreme Court of India to ask the Tamil Nadu Government to control the protests.  The BJP claimed that her suicide is a political conspiracy against the BJP. BJP President Tamilisai Soundarajan has warned protesters across the state against testing the BJP's tolerance.  Reaction to her death  Director Pa. Ranjith who attended her funeral stated  M.K.Stalin stated  T.T.V. Dhinakaran stated that    Bharatiya Janata Party's L. Murugan said that there was some external force behind her suicide and further said that Neet is required and urged the state government to prepare students to compete at national and international level.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Barbaridactylus\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Barbaridactylus is a nyctosaurid pterosaur from the Ouled Abdoun Basin of Morocco, a basin that dates back to the Maastrichtian stage of the Late Cretaceous. It was published in 2018 by paleontologists Nicholas R. Longrich, David M. Martill, and Brian Andres. In the same publication, two other nyctosaurids from the same basin were described: Alcione and Simurghia. The type and only species is B. grandis.  Discovery and naming  All known specimens of Barbaridactylus were uncovered in a 3-year dig that unearthed about 200 pterosaur specimens. Its type specimen is FSAC-OB 232, which consists of its right femur, left radius, ulna, humerus, and scapulocoracoid, and partial mandible. Four other specimens have been referred to Barbaridactylus, FSAC-OB 8, 9, 10, and 11. They are all humeri.  Barbaridactylus is named after the Barbary Coast of North Africa, and the Greek dactylo, meaning \"finger\". The proper word for \"finger\" in Ancient Greek however, is daktylos (\u03b4\u03ac\u03ba\u03c4\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2). Its specific name, grandis means \"great\" in Latin.  Description   Barbaridactylus is a large nyctosaurid, with a humerus length of . Like other nyctosaurids, Barbaridactylus had upward-curving jaws. The only known cervical is also rather typical for nyctosaurids, as it is proportionately short and broad, a morphology also present in the related pteranodontids. The scapulocoracoid is fused, meaning that the animal was probably an adult. It is boomerang shaped, and the two bones (the scapula and coracoid) form a 60 degree angle. The humeral shaft is long and thin. The hatchet-shaped deltopectoral crest (a distinctive feature of nyctosaurids) is in a notably distal location in relation to the humeral head, more similar to that of Nyctosaurus than Alcione. This crest is short and broad, and the expanded tip is weakly developed, which are basal features. The deltopectoral crest appears warped from an anterior view, more so than in other nyctosaurids, but much less than in pteranodontids. There is a pneumatic fossa located on the ventral surface of each humeral head that is unique to this species. The ulna is relatively gracile, unlike the robust ulna of Alcione, and its ends are weakly expanded. The diameter radius is approximately two thirds that of the ulna. The femur of Barbaridactylus is relatively typical for a nyctosaurid, although it lacks the strong distal expansion present in other nyctosaurids. Instead, it expands more gently, similar to that of Pteranodon.  Classification Below is a cladogram showing the results of a phylogenetic analysis first presented by Andres and colleagues in 2014, and updated with additional data by Longrich and colleagues in 2018. In this analysis, they found Barbaridactylus to be the sister taxon of the Nyctosaurus species N. lamegoi, both placed within the family Nyctosauridae.  Paleoecology   Barbaridactylus was discovered in upper Maastrichtian phosphates located in the Ouled Abdoun Basin of Northern Morocco. This geological formation does not belong to a formation. It is divided into couches, with Barbaridactylus being discovered in Couche III. This layer dates back to the latest Maastrichtian, about 1 million years before the extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous. Couche III represents the most diverse marine ecosystem known from the time.  A large variety of marine life is known from the region, including sharks and bony fish, in addition to turtles, plesiosaurs and mosasaurs. A few rare, fragmentary dinosaur fossils are known, including an abelisaur and a sauropod. Other pterosaurs in the formation were originally only represented by the azhdarchid Phosphatodraco mauritanicus. However, in addition to Barbaridactylus, more recent studies have revealed at least five more pterosaur species from this location, including Alcione, Simurghia and Tethydraco.  References  Late Cretaceous pterosaurs of Africa Fossil taxa described in 2018 Pteranodontians", "machine_text": " Barbaridactylus is an extinct genus of pterosaurs within the suborder Pterodactyloidea. The type species, Barbaridactylusvirginianus, is known from the Late Cretaceous period (Turonian age) of what is now the state of Virginia, United States. The generic name is derived from the Latin barbarus (\"strange\" or \"foreign\") and the Greek daktylos (\"finger\"), a reference to the distinctive elongated fingers of the front limbs. The specific name refers to the Virginia Military Institute, from which the type specimen was donated. Barbaridactylus is represented by a single specimen, the holotype. This specimen is a nearly complete skeleton with only the distal ends of the wings missing. The specimen is housed in the Virginia Museum of National History in Lexington, Virginia. The holotype specimen of Barbaridactylusvirginianus was discovered in 1987 in a matrix of the Niobara Formation at the Apple Bay site on the south side of the James River, 3.7 km (2.3 mi) southwest of the city of Lexington in northern Virginia. The specimen was found in a layer of sandstone that is part of the interval of the Niobara Formation, which is composed of fluvial and eolian sediments and is interpreted as a shoreline deposit. The Niobara Formation is part of the Colorado Group. Barbaridactylus is a small pterosaur, with a total length of 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in). The wingspan has been estimated at 2.5 m (8 ft 2.5 in) to 3.5 m (11 ft 5 in). The skull is relatively large, with a length of 70 cm (27.5 in). The lower jaw is slightly longer than the upper, and has a pair of large flanges on the lateral surfaces. The upper and lower teeth are closely packed and overlap each other strongly. The front teeth are very large and have a distinct notch on the crown. The first and second fingers of the front limb are very long and terminate in large claws. The metacarpal and metatarsal bones are short. The thighbone is long and has a fan-shaped arrangement of the lower end. The specimen was found in a concreted matrix of sandstone and clay. The matrix was so hard that it had to be dynamited to free the bones. The specimen was prepared by Ajnulla N. Lucas and is on display in the Hall of Reptiles and Birds at the Virginia Museum of National History. Barbaridactylus is classified as a basal member of the Pterodactyloidea, a large group of pterosaurs that includes the well-known relatives Quetzalcoatlus and Pteranodon. Barbaridactylus shares with other pterodactyloids a long list of unique features, such as the presence of a furcula, or \"wishbone\". It is unclear whether this feature is an innovation of the group, or whether it had been acquired by the common ancestor of all pterosaurs. Barbaridactylus was previously considered to be a species of the related genus Dimorphodon, but it was later recognized as a distinct genus, with the type species, B.virginianus, being described by Peter Wellnhofer in 1991. A second species, B.ischiadicus, was described by Alexander Averianov and Evgeny Aleksandrov in 2006. This species is known from the early Campanian-age (Upper Cretaceous) Belya Formation of the Russian Federation.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 57668120}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Pennine Way\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Pennine Way is a National Trail in England, with a small section in Scotland. The trail stretches for  from Edale, in the northern Derbyshire Peak District, north through the Yorkshire Dales and Northumberland National Park and ends at Kirk Yetholm, just inside the Scottish border. The path runs along the Pennine hills, sometimes described as the \"backbone of England\". Although not the United Kingdom's longest National Trail (this distinction belongs to the  South West Coast Path), it is according to The Ramblers \"one of Britain's best known and toughest\".  History  The path was the idea of the journalist and rambler Tom Stephenson, inspired by similar trails in the United States of America, particularly the Appalachian Trail. Stephenson proposed the concept in an article for the Daily Herald in 1935, and lobbied Parliament for the creation of an official trail. The walk was planned to end at Wooler but it was decided that Kirk Yetholm would be the finishing point. The final section was declared open in a ceremony held on Malham Moor on 24 April 1965. Before the official opening of the Pennine Way the British Army was invited to test the route, a task that was accomplished in one day. Junior soldiers from the Junior Tradesman's Regiment of the Army Catering Corps, based in Aldershot, were split into patrols of four or five and each was allocated an approximately  section of the walk. A report was then provided on the signage and route feasibility.  The Pennine Way celebrated its 50th anniversary in April 2015. A special four-part BBC One series The Pennine Way was broadcast throughout April.  Usage  The Pennine Way is popular with walkers, and in 1990 the Countryside Commission reported that 12,000 long-distance walkers and 250,000 day-walkers were using all or part of the trail annually and that walkers contributed \u00a32\u00a0million (1990) to the local economy along the route, directly maintaining 156 jobs. The popularity of the walk has resulted in substantial erosion to the terrain in places, and steps have been taken to recover its condition, including diverting sections of the path onto firmer ground, and laying flagstones or duckboards in softer areas. The actions have been effective in reducing the extent of broken ground, though the intrusion into the natural landscape has at times been controversial.  Accommodation is available at Youth Hostels, camp sites, B&Bs and pubs but are limited on upland stretches, so when planning the walk one must sometimes choose between a long day (between two places offering on-route accommodation) or two shorter days involving an evening descent off-route (to a nearby village or farm) with a morning re-ascent.  There are 535 access points where the Pennine Way intersects with other public rights of way. The route is crossed by many roads and passes through many villages and towns with good public transport. This makes it easy to sample a short section of the trail, or to split the Pennine Way across several holidays or long weekends.  Most of the Pennine Way is on public footpaths, rather than bridleways, and not accessible to travellers on horseback or bicycle but a roughly parallel Pennine Bridleway is open from Derbyshire to Cumbria. This route, open to anyone not using motorised vehicles, starts slightly farther south than the Pennine Way.  Route  A survey by the National Trails agency reported that a walker covering the entire length of the trail is obliged to navigate 287 gates, 249 timber stiles, 183 stone stiles and 204 bridges.  of the route is on public footpaths,  on public bridleways and  on other public highways. The walker is aided by the provision of 458 waymarks.  Peak District National Park  The Pennine Way originally climbed north from Edale across the middle of the Kinder Scout plateau. It was rerouted to reduce erosion, and now heads west to climb onto the plateau by steps known as Jacob's Ladder. It then turns north to follow the western edge of the plateau past Kinder Downfall, crosses the Snake Pass road (A57) and climbs Bleaklow. From the summit the trail descends to Longdendale. In the dale it crosses the dam of Torside Reservoir to Crowden, the first village since the start of the trail  away.  From Crowden the Pennine Way climbs a side valley past Laddow Rocks to the summit of Black Hill on the border of Yorkshire. It descends across Wessenden Head Moor (the eastern part of Saddleworth Moor) and the A635 road to the Wessenden Valley. It climbs out of the valley to leave the National Park at Standedge on the A62 road.  South Pennines  From Standedge the Pennine Way follows the Yorkshire\u2013Greater Manchester border north along a series of gritstone edges. It crosses the A640 road, then the A672, before crossing the M62 motorway by a long footbridge near Windy Hill. Past the motorway the trail follows Blackstone Edge to the A58 road, then passes a series of reservoirs. It crosses the Calderdale Way high above the village of Mankinholes, then climbs to the prominent monument on Stoodley Pike. From the monument it descends steeply to the valley of the River Calder, which it crosses about  west of the town of Hebden Bridge, the largest settlement near the route.  The trail climbs out of the Calder valley through the scattered hamlet of Colden, crossing Colden Water by an ancient clapper bridge. It then passes the Walshaw Dean Reservoirs and climbs to the ruins of Top Withens, said to have been the inspiration for Wuthering Heights. The trail then descends to Ponden Hall, and crosses more moorland to the villages of Cowling and Lothersdale.  From Lothersdale the trail crosses Pinhaw Beacon to Thornton-in-Craven. There then follows gentler country, including a short section of the towpath of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal at East Marton, to reach the village of Gargrave in Airedale, on the busy A65.  Yorkshire Dales National Park  North of Gargrave the Pennine Way ascends Airedale and enters the Yorkshire Dales National Park. It follows field paths, through the small villages of Airton and Hanlith to the larger village of Malham. It then climbs steps on the west side of Malham Cove, traverses the limestone pavement at the top of the cove, and continues north to Malham Tarn. The trail then crosses a shoulder of Fountains Fell, crosses the head of Silverdale and ascends the nose of Pen-y-Ghent in a very steep section. From the summit of Pen-y-Ghent the Pennine Way descends to the village of Horton in Ribblesdale (on the Settle\u2013Carlisle Railway).  The Pennine Way then heads up Ribblesdale along the old Settle\u2013Langstrothdale packhorse road. It passes the eastern end of Ling Gill and climbs Cam Fell, where it follows the line of a Roman road, shared with the Dales Way. The trail then passes Dodd Fell Hill and follows a ridge between Widdale and Sleddale, before descending into Wensleydale at Gayle and the adjoining town of Hawes.  The path crosses the dale to Hardraw, then begins the  ascent of Great Shunner Fell. From the summit of the fell the trail descends to upper Swaledale and the village of Thwaite. It then crosses the side of Kisdon, with good views down Swaledale, passes Kisdon Force, a waterfall on the River Swale, and reaches the village of Keld.  From Keld the path crosses the route of the Coast to Coast Walk, then ascends a side valley known as Stones Dale to reach Tan Hill and its isolated inn at the northern boundary of the National Park.  North Pennines  At Tan Hill the Pennine Way enters the North Pennines AONB and follows moorland tracks to the isolated settlement of Sleightholme, where the route divides. The main route heads directly north across the moors, crossing God's Bridge and passing beneath the A66 road in a tunnel. The alternative route enters the town of Bowes and rejoins the main route at Baldersdale. From Baldersdale the trail crosses Lunedale and descends to the small town of Middleton-in-Teesdale.  From Middleton the path ascends Teesdale on the right bank of the River Tees, below the village of Holwick. It passes the waterfalls of Low Force and High Force, and reaches the scattered settlement of Forest-in-Teesdale. Further up the Tees, the path climbs beside the waterfall of Cauldron Snout below the dam of Cow Green Reservoir. The trail then ascends the gently rising side valley of Maize Beck to reach High Cup Nick, one of the most photographed areas on the Pennine Way. From High Cup the trail descends to the village of Dufton.  From Dufton the Pennine Way climbs back up the fells, passing in turn the summits of Knock Fell, Great Dun Fell, Little Dun Fell and finally Cross Fell, at  the highest point on the entire path. Here, walkers can face tricky conditions in bad weather as a result of the Helm Wind which sweeps down the south-west slope of the escarpment. A long descent follows to the valley of the South Tyne at Garrigill. The trail then keeps close to the river to enter the town of Alston.  The trail continues down the valley of the South Tyne to Slaggyford and Knarsdale. Above the village of Lambley the trail leaves the valley to cross more moorland to the A69 near the village of Greenhead.  Northumberland National Park and the Scottish border  Outside Greenhead the Pennine Way passes Thirlwall Castle on Hadrian's Wall. For the next  the route coincides with the Hadrian's Wall Path, following the wall closely past Once Brewed to Rapishaw Gap,  west of the Housesteads Roman Fort.  From the wall the trail heads north through Wark Forest. Past the forest it follows field paths to Shitlington Crags and descends to the large village of Bellingham. More remote country follows, across Padon Hill and the edge of Redesdale Forest. The trail eventually reaches Redesdale at Blakehopeburnhaugh and Cottonshopeburnfoot, two neighbouring hamlets which compete for the longest name in England. The route then follows the River Rede upstream to the village of Byrness.  The last stage of the Pennine Way, across the Cheviot Hills from Byrness to Kirk Yetholm, is  long, with no habitation en route. It is usually tackled in one long day, although there are two refuge huts (or bothies). The trail climbs steeply from the village, then heads north to cross the Scottish border near Ogre Hill. For the rest of the stage the path switches between England and Scotland, along a fence which marks the border itself. Back in England the trail passes the Roman fort at Chew Green, and briefly follows the Roman road of Dere Street. The path then follows the border ridge, passing the high point of Windy Gyle. At the west top of Cairn Hill (), from where the path leads to the summit of The Cheviot and back down, the path turns sharply northwest with the border fence, descending to a refuge hut before climbing The Schil at , above the College Valley. The path then descends into Scotland and enters the village of Kirk Yetholm. The path ends at the Border Hotel.  Records The record time for completion of the Pennine Way is 2 days, 10 hours, 4 minutes and 53 seconds, set by John Kelly on 15\u201317 May 2021. Kelly had previously held the record for just one week in July 2020 with a time of 2 days, 16 hours and 46 minutes, before this was broken by Damian Hall with a time of 2 days, 13 hours and 35 minutes. Before this, the record had been held for 31 years by Mike Hartley (time of 2 days, 17 hours and 20 minutes).  The fastest women's time is 3 days and 46 minutes, set by Anna Troup on 14\u201317 August 2021. The previous record of 3 days, 2 hours and 28 minutes was set by Sabrina Verjee on 12\u201315 September 2020.  The route of the Pennine Way is the basis of the Spine Race, which was inaugurated in 2012.  Further reading   The Pennine Way has attracted a number of writers over the years, including Stephenson, who wrote the first official guidebook. A popular guide was written and illustrated by the writer Alfred Wainwright, whose offer to buy a half-pint of beer for anyone who finished the Pennine Way is estimated to have cost him up to \u00a315,000 by his death in 1991. The National Trail Guide contains a description of the route, GPS waypoints and 1:25000 maps of the entire walk. Barry Pilton's book One Man and His Bog gives a more lighthearted and personal account of completing the Pennine Way, with a foreword by Mike Harding. Mark Wallington's book Pennine Walkies (in which the author is accompanied by his dog) is another humorous personal story of the walk, as is Walking Home by Yorkshire poet Simon Armitage, who walked north-to-south along the Pennine Way without money, relying on his 'earnings' from nightly poetry readings along the way. Movement artists Tamara Ashley and Simone Kenyon performed the entire length of the trail in August 2006; their book documents the performance and invites readers to create their own interpretations of the landscapes along the way.

The trail is one of the most popular and famous walks in the United Kingdom, and the route is marked by a series of large, white, waymarkers. The Pennine Way is the oldest of the National Trails, and was first proposed as a coast-to-coast walk by Tom Stephenson in a 1940 issue of the Daily Express. After a number of years of debate, the trail was finally opened on April 24, 1965, by the Ramblers' Association. In the early days the Pennine Way was a challenge for even the most experienced walker, being incomplete in parts, with guide books containing suggestions for alternative routes and a number of dangerous sections. Since the early 1990s the Pennine Way has been fully waymarked, and is now the most popular walking trail in the UK, with over 250,000 walkers completing the route each year. The Pennine Way is also one of the most challenging walks in the UK, with many sections being very remote, and some hazardous underfoot. The Pennine Way is a walk of two distinct halves. The first half, from Edale to Hawes, is the most popular section of the trail, and is described as the \"core\" Pennine Way. This section of the route is waymarked by the familiar white, plastic discs, and is a much easier, though still challenging, walk. The second half, from Hawes to Kirk Yetholm, is a more remote and challenging walk, and is waymarked by metal and enamel discs. This section is described as the \"backbone\" of the Pennine Way, and in places the route follows the highest points of the Pennine Hills, with some sections being exposed and difficult underfoot. The Pennine Way is a walk that can be undertaken by people of all ages and abilities, although the trail is not suitable for people with severe mobility problems, as some sections of the route are very remote, and assistance is not always available. The terrain on the Pennine Way can vary from easy walking on well-defined tracks, to difficult, rocky, and often wet and muddy terrain in the upland areas. In the summer months the Pennine Way can be very busy, and in places the route can be crowded with walkers. In the winter months the route is much quieter, although some sections can be very exposed and dangerous in bad weather, and the trail is not recommended for inexperienced walkers at these times. The Pennine Way is a long and challenging walk, and preparation is essential. walkers are advised to plan their route carefully, and to ensure that they have the appropriate equipment and clothing for the trail. In the summer months the trail can be very hot and dry, and in the winter months the route can be very cold and wet, with some sections being exposed and dangerous in bad weather.

History Though the Festival offers contests (traditional band, neo-traditional band, fiddle, old-time banjo, and flatfoot dancing), square dancing, several concerts and workshops, and other organized activities such as yoga, basket making, and hymn singing, the heart and soul of the Festival is found in the campsites, where old time music provides a foundation for all kinds of straight-off-the-strings acoustic music (including Americana, cajun, Celtic, swing, bluegrass, Dawg, and even reggae), which in turn often spontaneously generate impromptu dancing and other festivities by the people gathered within earshot.  Though the Festival officially starts the Wednesday before the first full weekend in August, the grounds start filling up the weekend before with well-adorned campsites, many of which have music being played through the night.  One of the Festival's unique features is the Neo-Traditional Band Contest on Friday, in which highest scores are given to bands that creatively extend the old time music tradition into other musical voices, instrumentation, and styles.  Over the years, the Festival has been frequented by accomplished Nashville musicians like John Hartford and Tim O'Brien and Leftover Salmon jam band leader Vince Hermann, legendary old time Appalachian musicians like Melvin Wine and Lester McCumbers, leading \"second generation\" old time musicians like Mike Seeger, Bruce Molsky, Rafe Stefanini, Brad Leftwich, and Ira Bernstein, and the youngest generation of old time musicians like Jake Krack.  The Festival takes place each summer at Camp Washington-Carver, in Clifftop, Fayette County, West Virginia, United States and is sponsored by the West Virginia Division of Culture and History.

She was launched on 31 October 1981 sponsored by Mrs. Caspar Weinberger, and commissioned on 21 May 1983, with Commander Kenneth R. Karr in command.  With the second Commanding Officer, Alfred Ponessa, Norfolk conducted extensive trials of the next-generation torpedo, ADCAP, as well as advanced and secret acoustic experiments.  The ship also made an active deployment during one of the final spurts of activity from the declining Soviet navy. On 23 July 1988 Norfolk fired the first ADCAP torpedo, sinking the ex-.

Norfolk struck her starboard side into the port side of San Diego. There were no injuries, but both ships suffered damage. Norfolks commanding officer was subsequently relieved of command. The sub made a surface transit to Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay for drydocking and repairs within a few days, and San Diego required dry dock repairs that were completed 10 April 1989.  As a result of this collision, COMSUBLANT issued orders limiting submarine speed and passing activities while in the restricted waters of the Hampton Roads channels.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Autonomous University of Madrid\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Autonomous University of Madrid (; UAM), commonly known as simply la Aut\u00f3noma, is a Spanish public university located in Madrid, Spain. The university was founded in 1968 alongside the Autonomous University of Barcelona, in Barcelona. UAM is widely respected as one of the most prestigious universities in Europe. According to the highly regarded QS World University Rankings 2022, UAM is ranked as the top university in Spain.  The campus of the university spans a rural tract of , mostly around metropolitan Madrid. Founded in 1968, its main campus, Cantoblanco, is located near the cities of Alcobendas, San Sebasti\u00e1n de los Reyes and Tres Cantos. UAM's Cantoblanco Campus holds most of the university's facilities. It is located  north of Madrid and has an extension of over . Of these, nearly  are urbanised and about a third of them garden areas. UAM offers 94 doctorate programs in all of the universities studies. It also offers 88 master's degrees. According to a study carried out by the newspaper El Mundo, in 2013, UAM was the best university in the country to study biology, Nursing, Medicine, Physics and Law, within the 50 careers with the highest demand.  History  The Stabilization Plan of 1959 and the development plans of the 1960s boosted the Spanish economy after years of austerity and the self-sufficiency-based economy. The end of diplomatic and economic isolation led to an economic boom in Spain that resulted in the consolidation of a middle class similar to that of other Western European nations. The demand of higher education increased, and the Spanish university system grew increasingly congested.  The Autonomous University of Madrid was established by the 5-1968 Decree approved by the Spanish Council of Ministers during the Francoist dictatorship along with the Autonomous University of Barcelona and the University of Bilbao. This decree was sponsored by the then-Minister of Science and Education, Jos\u00e9 Luis Villar Palas\u00ed, in order to restructure the Spanish university system. The name Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid first appeared in an executive order by the Ministry which was published on 13 August 1968.  On 8 June 2018 the Autonomous University of Madrid celebrated its 50th Anniversary with a series of commemorative events, starting with a debate on university autonomy (after the scandal of the former president of the Community of Madrid, Cristina Cifuentes and her master's degree in the University Juan Carlos I). In the debate, called \"Past, present and future (1968\u20132018)\", the rector of the UAM Rafael Garesse, and the rectors of the Autonomous University of Barcelona, Margarita Arboix, and the Basque Country, Nekane Balluerka participated.  Campuses  Main campus  UAM's Cantoblanco Campus holds most of the university's facilities. It is located 15\u00a0km north of Madrid and has an extension of over 2,200,000\u00a0m2. Of these are nearly 770,000 urbanised and about a third of them garden areas. The campus was designed as a university town that was to be self-sufficient, but also would be away from Madrid in order to keep student activity against the Francoist dictatorship away from the capital.  Initially, the campus held the faculties of philosophy and liberal arts, law, economics, business management, and science, as well as the rectorate, several other service buildings and sports facilities. The university's other facilities, the faculty of medicine and the teacher training Santa Maria school are in downtown Madrid. There are two other teacher training schools in Segovia and in Cuenca. Over the years, the faculty of psychology, the biology building of the faculty of sciences, the new faculty of law (that allowed the transfer of the teacher training school to the main campus, and that was later transformed in faculty of education and teacher training) along with its political science annex building, the polytechnic school (initially superior technical school of computing engineers), the libraries of humanities and sciences, as well as the Erasmus of Rotterdam dormitory have been built on the main campus.  The original faculties were housed in interconnected buildings with several patios in between them. Characteristic of each building is a large number of stairs in its corridors, initially designed to prevent students from running in case of police raids. Currently, this fact has been considered by many university officials as a setback in the integration of handicapped students. The newest facilities were built in a contemporary style, being more accessible and allowing more free movement to students. Sporting facilities include two swimming pools (an indoor one and an outdoor one), two multiple-use pavilions, and outdoor tennis, football, basketball, paddle tennis, rugby, and futsal and beach volleyball courts.  Other services on campus include 16 cafeterias and other eating facilities, medical services, a pharmacy with optic care, a foreign languages pavilion, and a bookstore. The campus also houses several research facilities partnered with the Spanish Scientific Research Council (CSIC). Cantoblanco Campus is accessible by train belonging to Renfe Cercanias Commuter service (station Cantoblanco-Universidad), or by the Madrid Region Commuter Bus service. The campus is located in the B1 area of the Madrid Transports Consortium.  Medicine Campus UAM faculty of medicine is located north of Madrid near La Paz teaching hospital (that acts as one of the faculty's teaching hospitals, as Puerta de Hierro Majadahonda Hospital, La Princesa Hospital, Ni\u00f1o Jes\u00fas Hospital and Fundaci\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez D\u00edaz do). It was inaugurated in 1969. Juan Luis Vives Residence Hall was UAM's first residential facility. It is located in the Plaza Castilla area in northern Madrid. It has 130 residents and holds several cultural activities of the university.  La Cristalera La Cristalera residence is located in Miraflores de la Sierra, a village north of Madrid that was acquired by the university in 1989. It is used for conferences and meetings and is the main centre of UAM's summer courses.  Academic organization  The UAM is divided into eight faculties and superior schools that support and coordinate most of the university's academic and administrative activity. Each faculty is divided into departments that coordinate the teaching and research of the different subjects. Researchers can organise into research institutes in order to coordinate their activities in a specific research field. The university totals up to 59 departments and eight research institutes. In addition to these, the UAM has seven associate schools, which are not completely part of UAM's administrative structure, but issue UAM-recognised titles and are under UAM's academic regulations.  Faculties and superior schools:  Faculty of Philosophy and Liberal Arts  Faculty of Law  Faculty of Economic Science and Business Management  Faculty of Sciences  Faculty of Medicine  Faculty of Psychology  Engineering School (until 2002 Superior School of Computer Engineers)  Faculty of Teacher Training and Education (until 2002 Santa Maria School of Teacher Training)  Associate schools are:  Red Cross School of Nursing  Puerta de Hierro School of Nursing  Jimenez Diaz Foundation School of Nursing  ONCE School of physiotherapy  LaSalle Institute of Higher Education  Escuela de Gemolog\u00eda  Administrative organisation  UAM administration is established according to the 2001's Organic Law of Universities (LOU). The Senior Academic and Administrative Officer of the Autonomous University of Madrid is the rector, who must be, by law, a chair professor serving in the university, elected every four years with a two-term limit by universal graded suffrage. The current rector is Jos\u00e9 Maria Sanz, chair of applied physics, who substituted his predecessor Angel Gabilondo in 2009, when Gabilondo became Minister of Education. To aid the rector in the management of the university, he or she appoints an indefinite number of vice-rectors leading different administrative departments of the university (such as Student affairs or Graduate academic affairs), and a secretary general coordinating the rector's team and overseeing the legal procedures of the university, as well as university protocol. The rector, in accordance with the university's social board, also designates the manager as part of his team, which oversees the university's economic and administrative activity.  The grades assigned to each sector for rectoral elections in UAM according to its charter are:  Full professors: 51% of the final votes  Students: 28% of the final votes  Other professors: 9%  Non-teaching personnel: 9%  Teaching and research personnel in training: 3%.  UAM's collective government bodies are the University Assembly, The Board of Governors, and The Social Board. The University Assembly is made out of 153 full professors, 84 students, 27 hired, associate, or emeritus professors, 27 members of the non-teaching personnel, 9 research or teaching trainees, the rector, the secretary-general, and the manager. It is the highest representative body of the university. It elaborates the university's general guidelines, changes or passes a new university charter, elects twenty members of the Board of Governors, and elects the university Ombudsman.  The Board of Governors is the ordinary governmental body of the university. It controls and passes regulations on most of the university's academic, personnel, and administrative issues. It is composed of the rector, the secretary-general, the manager, 20 members elected by the assembly according to its composition, all the deans and the head of the polytechnic school, 7 heads of department, a head of research institute, 15 members designated by the rector and three members of the Social Board.  The Social Board is the body responsible for the relations between university and society. Its members are designated by trade unions, the municipality of Madrid, employers unions, companies related to the university, the Madrid Assembly and the Board of Governors of the university. It also oversees the universities financial activities and passes the university budget. Its current chairman is Manuel Pizarro.  Faculties are headed by a dean, whilst the responsible of the polytechnic school is called head. They are elected in the same way as the rector and have also a limit of two four-year terms. They are aided by vice-deans or deputy heads. They are overseen by a faculty or school board. Departments are led by the head of department and overseen by the department council.

It also offers 72 master's degrees, and with the implementation of the Bologna Process 16 recognised master's degrees for the academic year of 2006\u201307.  Research  In addition, the alliance of the four leading Spanish public Universities, two in Madrid (Aut\u00f3noma University of Madrid and Universidad Carlos III) and two in Barcelona (Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona, Universitat Pompeu Fabra) allows close collaboration between projects and researchers.  Reputation   Throughout its history, the UAM has been one of Spain's most prominent higher education institutions, being ranked second amongst Spanish universities by the El Mundo University Supplement (known as \"Las 50 Carreras\") (after the Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona). </ref> For the subject \"Mathematics\" the university was ranked within top 51-75 universities in the world (within top 12 in Europe). It was the Spanish university with the most researchers among the most cited according to the Thomson Reuters ranking citation in 2011.  Student life  Societies and compromise The Autonomous University of Madrid has an active student body, having organised one of Spain's most important events against the dictatorship in 1976 called the Iberian Peoples Festival. It had an attendance of over 70,000. UAM has over a hundred student societies covering activities ranging from student unionism to theatre and music. The oldest active association in UAM is the Law Students Association (AED in Spanish), a left-leaning student union established in 1981. Furthermore, there are new prominent societies in the field of social sciences, such a Debate Society (Sociedad de Debates UAM) and a Model UN society (UAM-I-MUN), both founded and run mainly by law students.  UAM does not have a formal student government body, as it has been rejected by students in several occasions, and instead students elect different student unions (usually with difference on political issues) to the different university government bodies.  In recent years, UAM students have organised massively to protest against terrorism, after the assassination of Francisco Tomas y Valiente by ETA in 1995, against the Organic Law of Universities in 2001, to clean Spain's northern coast after the Prestige oil spill in 2002, against the War in Iraq in 2003, to assist to the II European Social Forum also in 2003, and in solidarity with the victims of the 11 March 2004 Madrid train bombings.  Festivals and parties UAM is also a festive campus, holding several festivals during spring. The most important one was the Spring festival held until 1993, but halted due to massification. Since then minor festivals have been held by student associations. These festivals usually consist of rock concerts by amateur rock bands (many of which have members that are UAM) from midday until dusk. According to university regulations, festival profits have to be destined to charities or to the organisation of cultural events. In 2005, due to massification of the festivals that led to several problems, university officials suspended further festivals until a more convenient place for their celebration would be found. Thus, no festivals were held in 2006.  Notable alumni  Royalty King Felipe VI of Spain, Law Queen Sofia of Spain, studied Humanities, beginning her studies as Princess of Spain and finishing them as Queen of Spain.

Very little is known for certain about his life, other than he tutored Charlie Patton in the ways of the blues.  There have been suggestions that he moved to Chicago shortly after World War I. He left no known recordings.  According to researcher David Evans, Sloan was born in Mississippi in 1870, and by 1900 was living in the same community as the Patton and Chatmon families near Bolton, Mississippi.  He moved to the Dockery Plantation near Ruleville about the same time as the Pattons, between 1901 and 1904. Patton received some direct instruction from Sloan, and played with him for several years. Two of Patton\u2019s later accompanists, Tommy Johnson and Son House, both stated that Patton \"dogged every step\" of Sloan's.  Further research based on Census records has suggested that, in 1920, Sloan and his family were living around West Memphis, Arkansas.  He may have been the Henry Sloan whose death, aged 78, occurred in Crittenden County on March 13, 1948.

The Kazungula Bridge was first proposed in 2014, but the project was put on hold due to a lack of funding. In 2015, the project was revived with the support of the Chinese government, and a team of experts from the China Railway First Group were sent to conduct a feasibility study. In 2017, the government of Botswana announced that it would be funding the project, with the support of the Chinese government. The bridge is expected to be completed by 2024. The Kazungula Bridge is a symbol of the growing relationship between Africa and China, and it is expected to have a positive impact on the economies of both Botswana and Zambia.

It is part of the ZVV network, and is integrated with the rest of the Swiss rail network. The line is 21.3 km long, and has 24 stations. It is mostly double track, but there are two single-track sections. The line begins at Zurich Hauptbahnhof, and runs eastwards, southwards and then eastwards again, passing through the cities of Zurich, Dietikon, and Zug. It then crosses the country border with Germany, running along the northern edge of Lake Constance to the city of Constance, where it terminates. The standard-gauge railway was built by the Swiss National Railway (Schweizerische Nationalbahn, SNB). The first section was opened in 1897, and the whole line was in service by 1901. In 1902 the SNB opened a branch line from Zurich to Frauenfeld via Winterthur, and in 1904 it opened the standard-gauge Simplon Railway line between Brig and Domodossola. The SNB was taken over by the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB CFF FFS) in 1902. The line is now owned and operated by the SBB CFF FFS, and is served by trains of the SBB CFF FFS and of the ZVV. The SBB CFF FFS operates InterCity (IC) and EuroCity (EC) trains on the line. The ZVV operates S-Bahn trains on the line, and also some regional trains.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Seoul Korea Temple\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Seoul Korea Temple is the 37th operating temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).  History The first member of the church in South Korea was baptized in 1951. At that time Korea was in the midst of a war against Communist armies, with the UN intervening. Latter-day Saint servicemen from the United States were the first to bring the LDS Church's teachings to the area.  The first church's missionaries arrived in South Korea in 1954. Some years later, church apostle Boyd K. Packer was assigned to travel to South Korea and find a place in which to build a temple. After considering several locations, Packer eventually chose the property which the church had purchased almost two decades earlier. In 1981, the announcement was made for a temple in Seoul.  Gordon B. Hinckley, of the church's First Presidency, dedicated the Seoul Korea Temple on December 14, 1985. The temple's walls feature Korean granite with six white spires. A traditional, tiled \"hundred-year roof\" gives the temple a uniquely Korean appearance. Inside, the temple is decorated with delicate brush paintings, intricate wooden molding, silk wall coverings, gold leaf, dome chandeliers, and white lacquer furniture inlaid with mother of pearl.  After the temple was dedicated, a subway system was built in conjunction with the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. The system included a line that ended right at the base of the hill upon which the temple was built, making the temple even more accessible for church members.  The temple is located near what is today Sinchon Station on the Seoul Subway Line 2. This station is located near four major South Korean universities:  Yonsei University, Hongik University, Ewha Womans University, and Sogang University.  The Seoul Korea Temple has a total of , four ordinance rooms, and three sealing rooms.  In 2020, like all the church's other temples, the Seoul Korea Temple was closed temporarily during the year in response to the coronavirus pandemic.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Epimenides\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Epimenides of Cnossos (or  Epimenides of Crete) (; ) was a semi-mythical 7th or 6th century BC Greek seer and philosopher-poet, from Knossos or Phaistos.  Life While tending his father's sheep, Epimenides is said to have fallen asleep for fifty-seven years in a Cretan cave sacred to Zeus, after which he reportedly awoke with the gift of prophecy (Diogenes La\u00ebrtius i. 109\u2013115). Plutarch writes that Epimenides purified Athens after the pollution brought by the Alcmeonidae, and that the seer's expertise in sacrifices and reform of funeral practices were of great help to Solon in his reform of the Athenian state. The only reward he would accept was a branch of the sacred olive, and a promise of perpetual friendship between Athens and Cnossus (Plutarch, Life of Solon, 12; Aristotle, Ath. Pol. 1).  Athenaeus also mentions him, in connection with the self-sacrifice of the erastes and eromenos pair of Cratinus and Aristodemus, who were believed to have given their lives in order to purify Athens. Even in antiquity there were those who held the story to be mere fiction (The Deipnosophists, XIII. 78\u201379). Diogenes La\u00ebrtius preserves a number of spurious letters between Epimenides and Solon in his Lives of the Philosophers. Epimenides was also said to have prophesied at Sparta on military matters.  He died in Crete at an advanced age; according to his countrymen, who afterwards honoured him as a god, he lived nearly three hundred years. According to another story, he was taken prisoner in a war between the Spartans and Cnossians, and put to death by his captors, because he refused to prophesy favourably for them. Pausanias reports that when Epimenides died, his skin was found to be covered with tattooed writing. This was considered odd, because the Greeks reserved tattooing for slaves. Some modern scholars have seen this as evidence that Epimenides was heir to the shamanic religions of Central Asia, because tattooing is often associated with shamanic initiation. The skin of Epimenides was preserved at the courts of the ephores in Sparta, conceivably as a good-luck charm. Epimenides is also reckoned with Melampus and Onomacritus as one of the founders of Orphism.  According to Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, Epimenides met Pythagoras in Crete, and they went to the Cave of Ida.  Works  Several prose and poetic works, now lost, were attributed to Epimenides, including a theogony, an epic poem on the Argonautic expedition, prose works on purifications and sacrifices, a cosmogony, oracles, a work on the laws of Crete, and a treatise on Minos and Rhadymanthus.  Cretica Epimenides' Cretica (\u039a\u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac) is quoted twice in the New Testament. Its only source is a 9th-century Syriac commentary by Isho'dad of Merv on the Acts of the Apostles, discovered, edited and translated (into Greek) by Prof. J. Rendel Harris in a series of articles.  In the poem, Minos addresses Zeus thus:  The \"lie\" of the Cretans is that Zeus was mortal; Epimenides considered Zeus immortal. \"Cretans, always liars,\" with the same theological intent as Epimenides, also appears in the Hymn to Zeus of Callimachus. The fourth line is quoted (with a reference to one of \"your own poets\")  in Acts of the Apostles, chapter 17, verse 28.  The second line is quoted, with a veiled attribution (\"a prophet of their own\"), in the Epistle to Titus, chapter 1, verse 12, to warn Titus about the Cretans. The \"prophet\" in Titus 1:12 is identified by Clement of Alexandria as \"Epimenides\" (Stromata, i. 14). In this passage, Clement mentions that \"some say\" Epimenides should be counted among the seven wisest philosophers.  Chrysostom (Homily 3 on Titus) gives an alternative fragment: For even a tomb, King, of you They made, who never died, but ever shall be.  Epimenides paradox It is not clear when Epimenides became associated with the Epimenides paradox, a variation of the liar paradox. Epimenides himself does not appear to have intended any irony or paradox in his statement \"Cretans, always liars.\" In the epistle to Titus, there is a warning that \"One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, the Cretians are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.\" In the Middle Ages, many forms of the liar paradox were studied under the heading of insolubilia, but these were not associated with Epimenides.

Although the poem is lost, numerous fragments have been preserved in the works of other authors. He was also a philosopher, and was described by Plato as a magician. Plato also attributes to Epimenides the statement that the soul is immortal. His exact birth date is unknown, but he lived around the same time as the Buddha, around the 6th\u20135th century BC. Epimenides was born in Crete. He was a priest of the temple of Eileithyia, the goddess of childbirth, in Knossos. He was famous for his oracles and his poetry. His most famous poem was the Epimenides, concerning the foundation of the city of Knossos and the birth of the first king of Crete, Minos. Plato mentions Epimenides in several works. In the Apology, Plato's Socrates attributes to Epimenides the statement that the soul is immortal. In the Theaetetus, Plato's Socrates attributes to Epimenides the definition of the word \"sophist\": \"a man who makes the worse appear the better\". Plato also mentions Epimenides in his list of philosophers who were \"sophists\" in the sense that they were not concerned with absolute truth but with the way people perceived things. Plutarch mentions Epimenides in his Life of Theseus. He says that Epimenides met Theseus in Delos, and told him the story of his escape from Crete. Plutarch also says that Epimenides was the one who advised Theseus to sail to Crete and free Athens from the tribute that Minos had imposed on Athens. Diogenes Laertius includes Epimenides in his list of philosophers. He says that Epimenides was a philosopher and a poet, and that his writings were hard to understand. Epimenides is also mentioned by Plato in the Statesman. Plato's Socrates is talking to a man who is defining the word \"philosopher\", and Plato's Socrates attributes to Epimenides the statement that a philosopher is \"a lover of wisdom\".", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 81009}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Coyote Valley, California\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Coyote Valley is an area located in a narrowing of the southern Santa Clara Valley, in Northern California. Coyote Valley is approximately  in size and largely composed of farmland, orchards, open space preserves, and homes. Coyote Valley is generally divided into three sections: North Coyote Valley (which is part of San Jose), the unincorporated village of Coyote, California (which is located in North Coyote Valley), and South Coyote Valley (which is part of Morgan Hill).   Coyote Valley is one of the largest greenbelts in the San Francisco Bay Area. Today, much of Coyote Valley is preserved as open space, nature reserve, or protected farmland. The area was threatened by large-scale development in the early 2000s, which drew criticism from the public, resulting in the abandonment of the redevelopment plans and the establishment of the conservation policy which governs the valley today. The Coyote Gap at the extreme north end of Coyote Valley is a critical wildlife corridor for safe passage of animals from the Diablo Range in the east to the Santa Cruz Mountains in the west, as Coyote Valley is the narrowest point between the two mountain ranges.  Geography Coyote Valley is a floodplain approximately  and  wide, situated in a narrow constriction in Santa Clara Valley between the Diablo Range to the east and the Santa Cruz Mountains to the west. It contains the largest freshwater wetland in Santa Clara County, Laguna Seca, a mostly seasonal lake important to groundwater recharge. Coyote Valley was named a \u201c2001 Last Chance Landscape of America the Beautiful\", one of the ten most endangered American landscapes by Scenic America. The only landscape selected from California, Scenic America described Coyote Valley as: \u201cCoyote Valley is a rare scenic break in an otherwise urbanized area... The rolling hills, blossoming orchards, and grand oaks provide respite to visitors, residents, and myriad species of wildlife.\"  Coyote Valley is largely split between San Jose and Morgan Hill, but also includes the tiny unincorporated community of Coyote, California. It can be divided at Bailey Avenue into North Coyote Valley, which has San Jose addresses and includes the village of Coyote, and South Coyote Valley, which has Morgan Hill addresses.  Ecology The current width of the wildlife corridor through the Coyote Valley is . This is considered the minimum width for a viable wildlife corridor for multiple species.  De Anza College wildlife biologists and students have monitored wildlife in the Coyote Valley since December 2007. They have recorded 160 species of birds, 25 of which either are rare, have special status, or both. Because development and the multilane U.S. Highway 101 pose barriers to migration of mammals such as tule elk (Cervus elaphus nannoides), puma (Puma concolor), coyote (Canis latrans), bobcat (Lynx rufus), gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), American badger (Taxidea taxus), etc. the Coyote Valley and its permeable multiple highway underpasses/culverts serve as the last remaining safe passages between the mountains to the west and east. De Anza students have used motion activated cameras to document that these passages are used by deer, bobcats, puma, coyote, and other large mammals.  Tule elk were re-introduced to Mount Hamilton from 1978 to 1981. However, tule elk that live on the Mount Hamilton/Diablo side of the valley have been documented lining up near Highway 101, unable to cross.  Coyote Valley\u2019s vernal pools offer a safe haven to many amphibian species such as the California tiger salamander (Ambystoma californiense) and the California red-legged frog (Rana draytonii).  Coyote Valley is traversed by Coyote Creek, an important stream for steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) spawning runs.  Development controversy Currently, Coyote Valley is home to large areas of orchards and farms, although that scene has been expected to change for decades. The Dahlin Group, based in San Ramon, California, was chosen by the City of San Jose to create a master plan for the area. Dahlin Group's Conceptual Plan called for at least 50,000\u00a0jobs and 25,000\u00a0homes, an international garden, a  central lake, a hub and spoke Bus Rapid Transit system, and a green belt between the new town and Morgan Hill.  Citing costs and delays, developers stopped funding the planning process in March 2008.  Environmental impacts of development To determine the effects of development in the Coyote Valley, a Draft Environmental Impact Report, or DEIR was released in March 2007. San\u00a0Jose is the only city in Santa Clara County that allows developers to hand pick the environmental consultants who write the environmental impact reports for proposed projects. They can hire the companies directly, and hand in the reports with their application. When the DEIR was unveiled to the public, an unprecedented amount of criticism was generated with more than 1,000\u00a0pages of negative comments. These objections came from 55\u00a0organizations and individuals, and 28 public agencies including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The city decided to commission the remake of much of the Draft\u00a0EIR. The revision work and other planning costs was estimated at 2.5\u00a0million dollars and to take over a year to complete. This controversy led to many residents of San\u00a0Jose to call for an end to San Jose\u2019s developer-controlled environmental impact reports.  City of San Jose Documents    10/18/2007  City of San Jose Memorandum: Update on Scope, Schedule and Budget for Revision and Recirculation of the Coyote Valley Specific Plan Draft Environmental Impact Report.    03/30/2007  Coyote Valley Specific Plan Environmental Impact Report (EIR)    06/29/2007  Draft Environmental Impact Report (DEIR) Comments Received  Articles   11/12/2007  \"Running Wild\"   10/17/2007  \"Students Mobilize Against Valley Development\"  Fiscal analysis  The Draft Fiscal Analysis for Coyote Valley development concludes that San\u00a0Jose will make more money in tax revenues from development than it will spend on providing government services.  It reaches this conclusion by assuming that residential property  values and resulting taxes will increase 3% above inflation every year for 57\u00a0years.  The Committee for Green Foothills disputes this analysis, arguing that because household income has only increased 1% above inflation annually in San\u00a0Jose, it is impossible for the cost of housing to continuously increase faster than the means to pay for housing costs.  The Committee also argues the Draft Analysis overestimates income by failing to account for tax revenues \"cannibalized\" by businesses moving from other parts of San\u00a0Jose to Coyote Valley.  Developers end specific plan  On March 18, 2008, the developer/landowners in Coyote Valley announced they would no longer fund the Specific Plan process, which terminates that planning process. Developers cited the costs and delays in planning, while news reports noted increased political opposition.  Environmental groups claimed they found grossly inadequate environmental and fiscal analyses and claimed those flaws were factors that contributed to end the current proposal.  Other proposed developments remain possible in Coyote Valley, including the previously approved, but never built, Coyote Valley Research Park, and the proposed expansion of the Gavilan College campus. In 2017, Phase 1 of the Coyote Valley Center was completed, becoming Gavilan's newest instructional site and the home for South Bay Public Safety Training Consortium police and fire academies.

The northern part of the valley is known as the Santa Clara Valley, and the southern part of the valley is known as the San Benito Valley. The two valleys are divided by the Diablo Range. The total area of the Coyote Valley is about 968 square miles (2,476 km2). The Coyote Valley is a critical wildlife corridor connecting the Monterey Bay with the San Francisco Bay and is the largest area of protected open space in the San Francisco Bay Area. The valley is home to a number of rare and endangered plants and animals. The natural landscape of the Coyote Valley is mostly grassland, with coastal scrub and riparian areas along the numerous creeks and rivers. The soil is mostly a hard, compact, earthquake-formed bay mud, which makes up the majority of the Central Valley of California. The main stem of the Coyote Creek flows from the San Francisco Bay to the Monterey Bay. The creek is about 65 miles (105 km) long, and is one of the largest tributaries of the San Francisco Bay. The creek's source is in the Santa Cruz Mountains, and it flows south through the San Francisco Bay Area's South Bay region, then east through the Central Valley, joining the San Benito River near the city of San Benito. The San Benito River is a tributary of the Pajaro River, flowing from the Central Valley to the Monterey Bay. The river is about 65 miles (105 km) long. The river's source is in the Diablo Range, and it flows south through the Central Valley, joining the Coyote Creek near the city of San Benito, then continuing south to the Pajaro River at the city of Watsonville. The valley was first settled by the Ohlone people, who lived in a number of small bands in the area. The Ohlone lived in a culture of hunter-gatherers, with some fishing and limited agriculture. The first European settlers arrived in the 1700s, when the Spanish mission system was established in California. The Spanish friars established the San Juan Bautista Mission in the San Benito Valley, about 4 miles (6.4 km) west of the Pajaro River. The Spanish established the first pueblo, or town, in California at San Jose in the northern part of the Coyote Valley. The town of San Juan Bautista was established in 1849, and is the oldest town in the valley. The California Gold Rush of 1849 brought a large number of immigrants to the area, and the population of San Jose grew rapidly. The discovery of gold also drew people to the southern part of the valley, and the towns of Tres Pinos and Paicines were established in the early 1850s. The San Benito Valley was a major transportation corridor during the early days of California. The El Camino Real, the main road from San Francisco to Monterey, ran through the valley. The San Benito Valley was also the main route for the Butterfield Overland Mail, which was the first transcontinental mail service in the United States. The Butterfield Overland Mail used the San Andreas Lake bed as a portion of the route, which ran through the valley from 1858 to 1861. The San Benito Valley is also home to a number of rare and endangered plants and animals. The Diablo Range is home to the California red-legged frog and the San Benito Evening-primrose. The San Francisco Bay and the San Benito River are important habitat areas for the California clapper rail and the salt marsh harvest mouse. The valley is also home to a number of protected areas. The San Francisco Bay Area has a number of regional parks and preserves, including the South Bay Salt Ponds, Alviso Slough, and the Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge. The Central Valley has the Sunol Regional Park and the Blue Hills Regional Park. The San Benito Valley has the San Benito National Wildlife Refuge and the Bitterwater National Wildlife Refuge. The Coyote Valley is also home to a number of farms and ranches, and the area is known for its agriculture and livestock. The region is known for its production of vegetables, fruits, nuts, and wine grapes. The valley is also home to a number of cattle ranches, and the region is known for its production of beef, dairy products, and wool. The Coyote Valley is a beautiful and diverse landscape, and is a critical wildlife corridor connecting the San Francisco and Monterey Bays. The valley is home to a number of rare and endangered plants and animals, and is an important habitat area for a number of species. The valley is also home to a number of protected areas, and is a popular destination for hiking, biking, and bird watching.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1178623}

Later a third son, al-Qasim, had been designated as third successor. After Harun died in 809, al-Amin succeeded him in Baghdad. Encouraged by the Baghdad court, al-Amin began trying to subvert the autonomous status of Khurasan, and al-Qasim was quickly sidelined. In response, al-Ma'mun sought the support of the provincial \u00e9lites of Khurasan and made moves to assert his own autonomy. As the rift between the two brothers and their respective camps widened, al-Amin declared his own son Musa as his heir and assembled a large army. In 811, al-Amin's troops marched against Khurasan, but al-Ma'mun's general Tahir ibn Husayn defeated them in the Battle of Rayy, and then invaded Iraq and besieged Baghdad itself. The city fell after a year, al-Amin was executed, and al-Ma'mun became Caliph.   Al-Ma'mun chose to remain in Khurasan, however, rather than coming to the capital. This allowed the power vacuum which the civil war had fostered in the Caliphate's provinces to grow, and several local rulers sprang up in Jazira, Syria and Egypt. In addition, a series of Alid uprisings occurred, beginning with Abu'l-Saraya at Kufa and spreading to southern Iraq, the Hejaz, and Yemen. The pro-Khurasani policies followed by al-Ma'mun's powerful chief minister, al-Fadl ibn Sahl, and al-Ma'mun's eventual espousal of an Alid succession in the person of Ali al-Ridha, alienated the traditional Baghdad \u00e9lites, who saw themselves increasingly marginalized. Consequently, al-Ma'mun's uncle Ibrahim was proclaimed rival caliph at Baghdad in 817, forcing al-Ma'mun to intervene in person. Fadl ibn Sahl was assassinated and al-Ma'mun left Khurasan for Baghdad, which he entered in 819. The next years saw the consolidation of al-Ma'mun's authority and the re-incorporation of the western provinces against local rebels, a process not completed until the pacification of Egypt in 827. Some local rebellions, notably that of the Khurramites, dragged on for far longer, into the 830s.  Historians have interpreted the conflict variously; in the words of the Iranologist Elton L. Daniel, it has been regard as \"a conflict over the succession between a rather incompetent, besotted al-Amin and his shrewdly competent brother al-Ma'mun; as the product of harem intrigues; as an extension of the personal rivalry between the ministers al-Fadl b. Rabi and al-Fadl b. Sahl; or as a struggle between Arabs and Persians for the control of the government\".  Background  The origins of the civil war lie in the succession arrangements of Harun al-Rashid () as well as the internal political dynamics of the Abbasid Caliphate. The two main contenders, Muhammad al-Amin and Abdallah al-Ma'mun, were born six months apart in AH 170 (786/7) with al-Ma'mun being the elder. It was al-Amin however who was named first heir in 792, while al-Ma'mun followed in 799, a sequence which was influenced by their lines of descent and their political implications: al-Amin had a solidly Abbasid lineage, being Harun's son by Zubayda, herself descended from the second Abbasid Caliph al-Mansur (), while al-Ma'mun's mother was Marajil, a Persian concubine from Badhgis in Khurasan.  While al-Ma'mun's origin was less prestigious than the purely Arab al-Amin, his ties to Khurasan and the Iranian-dominated eastern provinces were an important factor in his choice as heir. In contrast to the exclusively Arab-ruled Umayyad Caliphate, the Abbasid state was under heavy Iranian, and particularly Khurasani, influence. The Abbasid Revolution, which brought the Abbasids to power, originated in Khurasan, and the Abbasid dynasty relied heavily on Khurasanis as military leaders and administrators. Many of the original Khurasani Arab army (Khurasaniyya) that came west with the Abbasids were given estates in Iraq and the new Abbasid capital, Baghdad, and became an elite group known as the abna\u02be al-dawla (\"sons of the state/dynasty\"). Khurasan retained a privileged position among the Caliphate's provinces, and Harun al-Rashid in particular was careful to cultivate his ties with the Iranian element of the Caliphate, not least through his promotion of the Khurasani Barmakid family to positions of power. Both al-Amin and al-Ma'mun had been tutored in their youth by the Barmakids, al-Amin by al-Fadl ibn Yahya and al-Ma'mun by Ja'far ibn Yahya. While al-Amin would distance himself from the Barmakids and become closely associated with the abna\u02be aristocracy of Baghdad, al-Ma'mun remained influenced by Ja'far and his associates.  In 802, Harun and the most powerful officials of the Abbasid government made the pilgrimage to Mecca, where the definitive succession arrangement was drawn up: al-Amin would succeed Harun in Baghdad, but al-Ma'mun would remain al-Amin's heir and would additionally rule over an enlarged and practically independent Khurasan. A third son, al-Qasim (al-Mu'tamin), was also added as third heir and received responsibility over the frontier areas with the Byzantine Empire. The stipulations of the agreement, extensively recorded by the historian al-Tabari, may however have been distorted by later apologists of al-Ma'mun, especially as regards the extent of the autonomy granted to al-Ma'mun's eastern viceroyalty.  Almost immediately after it returned to Baghdad, in January 803, the Abbasid court witnessed the abrupt fall of the Barmakid family from power. On the one hand, this decision may reflect the fact that the Barmakids may have become indeed too powerful for the Caliph's liking, but its timing suggests that it was tied to the succession issue as well: with al-Amin siding with the abna\u02be and al-Ma'mun with the Barmakids, and the two camps becoming more estranged every day, if al-Amin was to have a chance to succeed, the power of the Barmakids had to be broken. Indeed, the years after the fall of the Barmakids saw an increasing centralization of the administration and the concomitant rise of the influence of the abna\u02be, many of whom were now dispatched to take up positions as provincial governors and bring these provinces under closer control from Baghdad.  This led to unrest in the provinces, especially Khurasan, where, according to Elton L. Daniel, \"Abbasid policies [fluctuated] between two extremes. One governor would attempt to extract as much wealth as he could from the province for the benefit of Iraq, the central government, and, not infrequently, himself. When the people protested loudly enough, such governors would be temporarily replaced by ones who would attend to local interests\". The Khurasani elites had a long-standing rivalry with the abna\u02be. Although the latter now resided chiefly in what is now Iraq, they insisted on retaining control of Khurasani affairs and demanded that the province's revenues be sent west to supply their salaries, something strongly resisted by the local Arab and Iranian elites. The resulting tension was eased when al-Fadl ibn Yahya, universally praised as a model governor, was appointed to Khurasan in 793, but was re-fanned in 796, when a member of the abna\u02be, Ali ibn Isa ibn Mahan, was placed in charge of the province. His harsh taxation measures provoked increasing unrest, which expressed itself in Kharijite uprisings and, finally, a rebellion by the governor of Samarkand, Rafi ibn al-Layth. This uprising forced Harun himself, accompanied by al-Ma'mun and the powerful chamberlain (hajib) and chief minister al-Fadl ibn al-Rabi, to travel to the province in 808. Al-Ma'mun was sent ahead with part of the army to Marv, while Harun stayed at Tus, where he died on 24 March 809.  Civil war between al-Amin and al-Ma'mun, 809\u2013813 Upon Harun's death, al-Amin ascended the throne in Baghdad, where his popularity was great, while al-Ma'mun remained at Marv, from where he planned to campaign against the remaining rebels. However, al-Amin recalled the army and treasury from the east, leaving al-Ma'mun with little in the way of military forces. It was in this time that al-Ma'mun came to rely upon his wazir, the former Barmakid prot\u00e9g\u00e9 al-Fadl ibn Sahl, who began to implement a policy of conciliation and cooperation with the local elites, whose autonomy and privileges were guaranteed. The covenant of 802 however soon began to fall apart over Baghdad's centralizing ambitions and the dispute over the status of Khurasan: the abna\u02be, led by Ali ibn Isa, whom Harun had imprisoned but who was now set free and appointed head of the Caliph's bodyguard, were joined by other influential officials, chief amongst them al-Fadl ibn al-Rabi, in demanding that Khurasan and its revenue return to the direct control of the central government, even if that meant breaking the stipulations of the Mecca agreement.  Some modern scholars have tried to interpret the conflict between the two brothers as a confrontation between the Arab and Iranian elements of the caliphate, represented by the two contenders' mothers. It is true that the Iranian-dominated East generally backed al-Ma'mun, but neither was al-Amin a conscious champion of \"Arabism\", nor was the support for al-Ma'mun the result of his Iranian origin, although his supporters did make propaganda among the local population for the \"son of their sister\". Al-Ma'mun enjoyed the support of the local elites of Khurasan mainly because they saw in him a champion of their newly won autonomy, and because he himself assiduously cultivated that support. Later, during the war, the prospect of his victory also offered the Khurasanis the promise of a yet more privileged position in the new regime. However, the conflict was first and foremost a dynastic dispute, with al-Amin attempting to institute a direct patrilineal succession. In this he did nothing but follow the footsteps of his predecessors since al-Mansur, all of whom struggled against the claims of brothers or cousins. Harun al-Rashid himself was imprisoned during the brief reign of his elder brother al-Hadi (). Given to indolence and lacking any political ability himself, al-Amin entrusted this project to al-Fadl ibn al-Rabi, who is generally portrayed as the \"evil genius\" behind al-Amin, and one of the main instigators of the conflict. Very quickly, al-Amin  moved to sideline the youngest brother, Qasim. Initially, Qasim was removed from his governorship of the Jazira, but soon after he was stripped altogether of his place in the succession and placed under guard at Baghdad. It was only because al-Ma'mun resided far from the Caliph's immediate area of control that he escaped sharing this fate.   The rift between the two camps manifested in 810, when al-Amin added his own son, Musa, to the line of succession. Al-Amin then sent a delegation to Marv, asking al-Ma'mun to return to Baghdad. After al-Ma'mun, fearing for his safety, refused, al-Amin began to interfere with his brother's domain: he protested al-Ma'mun's pardon to Ibn al-Layth after his surrender and asked for tribute from the governors of the western provinces of Khurasan as a sign of submission. He then demanded of his brother the cession of the western regions of Khurasan, the admission of caliphal tax and postal agents into the province, and the forwarding of the Khurasan's revenue to Baghdad. Al-Ma'mun, who could not rely on large military forces and whose position was consequently weak, was at first inclined to accede to his brother's demands, but al-Fadl ibn Sahl dissuaded him from this course and encouraged him to seek support among the native population of Khurasan, who also opposed control by the caliphal court.  Al-Ma'mun, who was already favourably regarded after the excesses of Ali ibn Isa, consciously set about to cultivate the support of the local population, reducing taxes, dispensing justice in person, conceding privileges to the native princes, and demonstratively evoking episodes from the beginnings of the Abbasid movement in the province. He now became a \"political magnet for Iranian sympathisers\" (El-Hibri) refused to cede his province or return to Baghdad, and began to gather around him those dissatisfied with Baghdad's centralizing policies or who had simply been left out of the share of spoils and power after the Abbasid Revolution.  Under the influence of their respective chief ministers, al-Amin and al-Ma'mun took steps that further polarized the political climate and made the breach irreparable. After al-Ma'mun symbolically removed al-Amin's name from his coins and from the Friday prayer, in November 810 al-Amin removed al-Ma'mun and al-Mu'tamin from the succession and nominated his own sons Musa and Abdallah instead. Al-Ma'mun replied by declaring himself imam, a religious title which shied of directly challenging the Caliph but nevertheless implied independent authority, as well as hearkening back to the early days of the Hashimiyya movement which had carried the Abbasids to power.  Despite the reservations of some of his senior ministers and governors, two months later, in January 811, al-Amin formally began the civil war when he appointed Ali ibn Isa governor of Khurasan, placed him at the head of an unusually large army of 40,000 men, drawn from the abna\u02be, and sent him to depose al-Ma'mun. When Ali ibn Isa set out for Khurasan, he reportedly took along a set of silver chains with which to bind al-Ma'mun and carry him back to Baghdad. The news of Ali's approach threw Khurasan into panic, and even al-Ma'mun considered fleeing. The only military force available to him was a small army of some 4,000\u20135,000 men, under Tahir ibn al-Husayn. Tahir was sent to confront Ali's advance, but it was widely regarded as almost a suicide mission, even by Tahir's own father. The two armies met at Rayy, on the western borders of Khurasan, and the ensuing battle on 3 July 811 resulted in a crushing victory for the Khurasanis, in which Ali was killed and his army disintegrated on its flight west.  Tahir's unexpected victory was decisive: al-Ma'mun's position was secured, while his main opponents, the abna\u02be, lost men, prestige and their most dynamic leader. Tahir now advanced westwards, defeated another abna\u02be army of 20,000 under Abd al-Rahman ibn Jabala after a series of hard-fought engagements near Hamadan, and reached Hulwan by winter. Al-Amin now desperately tried to bolster his forces by alliances with Arab tribes, notably the Banu Shayban of Jazira and the Qays of Syria. The veteran Abd al-Malik ibn Salih was sent to Syria to mobilize its troops along with Ali ibn Isa's son, Husayn. However, al-Amin's efforts failed due to the long-standing intertribal divisions between Qaysis and Kalbis, the Syrians' reluctance to get involved in the civil war, as well as the unwillingness of the abna\u02be to cooperate with the Arab tribes and to make political concessions to them. These failed efforts to secure Arab tribal support backfired on al-Amin, as the abna\u02be began to doubt whether their interests were best served by him. In March 812, Husayn ibn Ali led a short-lived coup against al-Amin in Baghdad, proclaiming al-Ma'mun as the rightful Caliph, until a counter-coup, led by other factions within the abna\u02be, restored al-Amin to the throne. Fadl ibn al-Rabi, however, one of the main instigators of the war, concluded that al-Amin's case was lost and resigned from his court offices. At about the same time, al-Ma'mun was officially proclaimed caliph, while Fadl ibn Sahl acquired the unique title of Dhu 'l-Ri'asatayn (\"he of the two headships\"), signifying his control over both civil and military administration.  In spring 812, Tahir, reinforced with more troops under Harthama ibn A'yan, resumed his offensive. He invaded Khuzistan, where he defeated and killed the Muhallabid governor Muhammad ibn Yazid, whereupon the Muhallabids of Basra surrendered to him. Tahir also took Kufa and al-Mada'in, advancing on Baghdad from the west while Harthama closed in from the east.At the same time, al-Amin's authority crumbled as supporters of al-Ma'mun took control of Mosul, Egypt and the Hejaz, while most of Syria, Armenia and Adharbayjan fell under the control of local Arab tribal leaders. As Tahir's army closed on Baghdad, the rift between al-Amin and the abna\u02be was solidified when the desperate Caliph turned to the common people of the city for help and gave them arms. The abna\u02be began deserting to Tahir in droves, and in August 812, when Tahir's army appeared before the city, he established his quarters in the suburb of Harbiyya, traditionally an abna\u02be stronghold.  The historian Hugh N. Kennedy characterized the subsequent siege of the city as \"an episode almost without parallel in the history of early Islamic society\" and \"the nearest early Islamic history saw to an attempt at social revolution\", as Baghdad's urban proletariat defended their city for over a year in a vicious urban guerrilla war. Indeed, it was this \"revolutionary\" situation in the city as much as famine and the besiegers' professional expertise, that brought about its fall: in September 813, Tahir convinced some of the richer citizens to cut the pontoon bridges over the Tigris that connected the city to the outside world, allowing al-Ma'mun's men to occupy the city's eastern suburbs. Al-Ma'mun's troops then launched a final assault, in which al-Amin was captured and executed at Tahir's orders while trying to seek refuge with his old family friend Harthama. While al-Ma'mun was probably not implicated in the act, it was politically convenient, as it left him both de jure and de facto the legitimate caliph.  Sahlid dominance and reaction, 813\u2013819  Nevertheless, the regicide soured al-Ma'mun's victory. Tahir was soon transferred out of the public eye to an unimportant post in Raqqa, but his deed lastingly tarnished the prestige and image of the Abbasid dynasty. According to Elton Daniel, \"It shattered the sacrosanct aura which had surrounded the person of the Abbasid caliphs; For the first time, an Abbasid ruler had been humiliated and put to death by rebellious subjects\". As al-Ma'mun remained in Marv and made no signs of returning to the caliphal capital, a wave of Arab antipathy towards al-Ma'mun and his \"Persian\" supporters came to the fore in the western regions of the Caliphate, particularly in Baghdad and surroundings, which feared being degraded to a mere province. This was furthered when the new Caliph entrusted the governance of the state to Fadl ibn Sahl, who intended to permanently move the Muslim world's centre of power eastwards to Khurasan, where he and his circle could control the reins of power to the exclusion of other groups. Fadl was also responsible for side-lining many other supporters of al-Ma'mun; thus, when Harthama ibn A'yan went to Marv to inform al-Ma'mun of the real situation in the west, the Sahlids turned the Caliph against him and he was executed on charges of treason in June 816. In response, Harthama's son Hatim led a short-lived revolt in Armenia.  The result of these policies was that revolts and local power struggles erupted across the Caliphate, with only Khurasan and the frontier districts with the Byzantine Empire exempt from this turmoil. Iraq in particular descended into near-anarchy. The new governor of Iraq, Fadl's brother al-Hasan ibn Sahl, soon lost the support of the abna\u02be. The local population's alienation from his regime was exploited by the Zaydi Alids, who on 26 January 815 rose in revolt at Kufa, led by Abu'l-Saraya. The revolt spread quickly through Iraq region as various groups with old grievances against the Abbasids used the opportunity to exact revenge. The revolt was nominally led by the Alid Ibn Tabataba, and after his death by Zayd, a son of the imam Musa al-Kadhim who had been executed in 799 on Harun al-Rashid's orders. The uprising came close to threatening Baghdad itself, and it was only through the intervention of the capable Harthama that it was quelled, with Abu'l-Saraya being captured and executed in October. Secondary pro-Alid movements also seized control of Yemen (under Ibrahim al-Jazzar, another son of Musa al-Kadhim) and the Tihamah, including Mecca, where Muhammad al-Dibaj, a grandson of the Alid imam Ja'far al-Sadiq, was proclaimed anti-caliph in November 815. The suppression of these revolts was entrusted to Ali ibn Isa's son Hamdawayh, with an army of abna\u02be. Hamdawayh was successful in subduing these provinces, but then attempted, unsuccessfully, to secede from the Caliphate himself.  In 816, to bolster his flagging prestige, al-Ma'mun assumed the title \"God's Caliph\". Taking note of the widespread Alid support in his western provinces, al-Ma'mun not only spared the lives of the various Alid anti-caliphs, but on 24 March 817 also named the Alid Ali ibn Musa al-Ridha, third son of Musa al-Kadhim, as his heir apparent, and even changed the official dynastic colour from Abbasid black to Alid green. Although the seriousness of al-Ma'mun's commitment to the Alid succession is uncertain\u2014there are suggestions that Ali al-Ridha was so old that he could hardly be expected to actually succeed al-Ma'mun\u2014its impact was disastrous: not only did it fail to produce any tangible popular support, but also provoked an uproar among the members of the Abbasid family in Baghdad. Hasan ibn Sahl had already been forced to abandon the city, where various factional leaders now shared power, and the news of the Alid succession ruined his attempts at conciliation. Instead, on 17 July 817 the members of the Abbasid family in Baghdad nominated a new Caliph of their own, Harun al-Rashid's younger brother Ibrahim. Ibrahim received broad backing from the Baghdad elites, from Abbasid princes like al-Ma'mun's younger brother Abu Ishaq (the future Caliph al-Mu'tasim, ) to old-established members of the bureaucracy like Fadl ibn al-Rabi (who returned to his office as hajib), and leaders of the abna\u02be. As the scholar Mohamed Rekaya commented, \"in other words, it was a revival of the war between the two camps [Baghdad and Khurasan], dormant since 813\".  Ibrahim moved to secure control of Iraq, but although he captured Kufa, Hasan ibn Sahl, who had made Wasit his base of operations, managed to get to Basra first. However, the governor of Egypt, Abd al-Aziz al-Azdi, recognized Ibrahim as Caliph. In Khurasan, the Sahlids at first downplayed the events at Baghdad, falsely informing al-Ma'mun that Ibrahim had merely been declared governor (amir) rather than Caliph. Finally, in December 817 Ali al-Ridha succeeded in revealing to al-Ma'mun the real situation in Iraq, and convinced him that the turmoil in the Caliphate was far greater than the Sahlids presented it to be, and that a reconciliation with Baghdad was necessary. Al-Ma'mun now resolved to assume personal control of his empire, and on 22 January 818 he left Marv and began a very slow journey west to Baghdad. Fadl ibn Sahl was murdered on 13 February, probably on al-Ma'mun's orders, although the rest of his family was spared a persecution like that which had befallen the Barmakids. Indeed, Hasan ibn Sahl was for the time being confirmed in his brother's position, and al-Ma'mun was betrothed to one of his daughters. Ali al-Ridha also died during the march on 5 September, possibly of poison. His burial place at Sanabad, now known as Mashhad (\"the place of martyrdom\"), was to become a major Shi'a pilgrimage site.  In the meantime, back in Baghdad, Ibrahim faced desertions, rebellions and conspiracies, one of which involved his half-brother al-Mansur. Hasan ibn Sahl was able to use this turmoil and advance north, capturing Mada'in. As the months passed, discontent in Baghdad grew. Ibrahim's supporters, including Fadl ibn al-Rabi, began abandoning him, and in April and July 819 there was a plot to take Ibrahim captive and surrender him to al-Ma'mun's forces. Narrowly escaping from this conspiracy, Ibrahim abandoned the throne and went into hiding, opening the path for al-Ma'mun to reclaim Baghdad. On 17 August 819, al-Ma'mun entered Baghdad without resistance, and the political turmoil quickly subsided. Al-Ma'mun now set about to reconcile himself with the opposition: he rescinded the Alid succession, restored black as the dynastic colour, sent Hasan ibn Sahl into retirement, and recalled Tahir from his exile in Raqqa. Al-Ma'mun did however retain the title of imam, which became part of the standard caliphal titulature.  During the 812\u2013813 siege of Baghdad, Tahir had established close ties with the abna\u02be, which now proved useful in smoothing their acceptance of al-Ma'mun. Tahir was further rewarded with the governorship of Khurasan in September 821, and when he died in October 822, he was succeeded by his son, Talha. For the next fifty years, the Tahirid line would provide the governors of a vast eastern province centred on Khurasan, while also providing the governors of Baghdad, securing the city's loyalty to the caliphal government even after the capital was moved to Samarra.  Reunification and pacification of the Caliphate, 820\u2013837 At the time al-Ma'mun entered Baghdad, the western provinces of the Caliphate had slipped away from effective Abbasid control, with local rulers claiming various degrees of autonomy from the central government. Egypt had become divided between two bitterly hostile factions, one under Ubayd Allah ibn al-Sari which had come to control Fustat and the south, while his rival Ali ibn Abd al-Aziz al-Jarawi and his Qaysi Arabs controlled the north of the country around the Nile Delta. In addition, Alexandria was in the hands of a group of Andalusian exiles. In northern Syria and the Jazira, the traditionally dominant Qays tribe had taken control, led by Abdallah ibn Bayhas and Nasr ibn Shabath al-Uqayli. Ifriqiya had fallen under the control of the Aghlabids, while Yemen was troubled by pro-Alid revolts. Perhaps the most threatening rebellion of all was the anti-Muslim Khurramite movement, which controlled large parts of Adharbayjan and Armenia.  To face these insurgencies, al-Ma'mun turned to another of Tahir's sons, Abdallah ibn Tahir, to whom he entrusted the command of his army. Ibn Tahir first targeted Nasr ibn Shabath in northern Syria and the Jazira. Nasr was willing to acknowledge al-Ma'mun's authority, but demanded concessions for his followers and remained hostile to the Abbasids' Persian officials, so that he had to be browbeaten into submission by a show of force before his capital, Kaysum, in 824\u2013825. After securing his northern flank, Ibn Tahir marched through Syria into Egypt. There the two rivals, although not opposed in principle to al-Ma'mun as Caliph, were eager to maintain the status quo, and had already repulsed an invasion in 824 under Khalid ibn Yazid ibn Mazyad. Ibn Tahir however managed to outmanoeuvre both, so that Ali al-Jarawi quickly went over to him, leaving Ubayd Allah to submit and face deportation to Baghdad. In Alexandria, Ibn Tahir secured the departure of the Andalusians, who left the city for the Byzantine island of Crete, which they conquered and transformed into a Muslim emirate. On his return to Baghdad in 827, Abdallah ibn Tahir received a triumphal reception, and was appointed governor of Khurasan in 828, replacing Talha. His place in the west was taken over by al-Ma'mun's younger brother Abu Ishaq al-Mu'tasim. In Yemen, another Alid revolt broke out in 822 under Abd al-Rahman ibn Ahmad, but al-Ma'mun managed to secure his surrender by negotiations.  Elsewhere, however, the process of consolidation was harder, or failed completely: Aghlabid-controlled Ifriqiya was confirmed in its autonomous status, effectively slipping entirely from Abbasid control, while in Adharbayjan, al-Ma'mun's general Isa ibn Abi Khalid re-established control over the various local Muslim lords in the cities, but was unable to suppress the Khurramite revolt. Expeditions were sent against the Khurramites under Sadaka ibn Ali al-Azdi in 824 and Muhammad ibn Humayd al-Ta'i in 827\u2013829, but both failed before the mountainous terrain and the Khurramites' guerrilla tactics, with Ibn Humayd losing his life as well. It was not until the accession of al-Mu'tasim, who employed his new military corps composed of Turkish slave-soldiers (mawali or ghilman) against the Khurramites, that their rebellion was suppressed in 837, after years of hard campaigning. Despite the restoration of caliphal authority in most provinces, the Caliphate continued to be troubled by rebellions: the rest of al-Ma'mun's reign saw a series of uprisings by the Zutt in lower Iraq, a three-year revolt against oppressive taxation in Egypt in 829, in which both the Christian Copts and the Muslims participated, as well as the unsuccessful revolt of Ali ibn Hisham, Ibn Humayd's successor as governor of Armenia and Adharbayjan.  Aftermath and impact  The long civil war shattered the social and political order of the early Abbasid state, and a new system began to emerge under al-Ma'mun, which would characterize the middle period of the Abbasid Caliphate. The most tangible change was in the elites who supported the new regime: the abna\u02be, the old Arab families and the members of the Abbasid dynasty itself lost their positions in the administrative and military machinery, and with them their influence and power. The provinces of the Caliphate were now grouped into larger units, often controlled by a hereditary dynasty, like the Tahirids in Khurasan or the Samanids in Transoxiana, usually of Iranian descent. At the same time, however, al-Ma'mun tried to lessen his dependence on the Iranian element of his empire, and counterbalanced them through the creation of two new military corps: his brother Abu Ishaq's Turkish slaves, and the Arab tribal army of the Byzantine frontier, which was now reorganized and placed under the command of al-Ma'mun's son al-Abbas. This system was further elaborated and acquired its definite characteristics in the reign of Abu Ishaq (al-Mu'tasim), who created a tightly controlled, centralized state, and expanded his Turkish corps into an effective military force with which he waged campaigns against the Byzantines and internal rebellions alike. The Turkish leaders came to political power as provincial governors, while the old Arab and Iranian elites were completely sidelined. Al-Ma'mun's victory also had repercussions in the Abbasid official theological doctrine: in 829, al-Ma'mun adopted Mu'tazilism, in an attempt reconcile doctrinal differences in Islam and reduce social inequities.  At the same time, the willingness of al-Ma'mun and his successors to embrace the non-Arab populations of the Caliphate, especially in the Iranian East, as well as to entrust the governance of these provinces to local dynasties with considerable autonomy, helped to end a long series of religiously-motivated rebellions and reconciled these populations to Islam: the rate of conversion during al-Ma'mun's reign increased markedly, and that was the time when most of the local princely families of the Iranian lands finally became Muslims. As El-Hibri comments, \"in time this development represented a prelude to the emergence of autonomous provincial dynasties in the east, which would relate to the caliphal centre in nominal terms of loyalty only\".

The causes of the fourth fitna were similar to those of the second and third fitnas, with the major causes being the tension between the executive and legislative branches of government, the concentration of power in the hands of the caliph, the failure of the caliph to meet the expectations of the ruled, economic and social hardships imposed by the ruling regime, and the desire of the ruled to share in the ruling elite's privileges. The fourth fitna was characterized by the fragmentation of the opposition to the Umayyads. Whereas the opposition during the second and third fitnas was primarily regional, during the fourth fitna it became primarily tribal. The tribes of Banu Tamim, Banu Qahtan, and Banu Asad were the most active in the conflict. The fourth fitna also featured the first instance of widespread ideological opposition to the Umayyads, in the form of the Kharijites, who opposed the Umayyads' accommodations to the non-Muslims and the elite's privilege. The first phase of the fourth fitna began with the murder of the Umayyad caliph Ali ibn Abi Talib in 661 and the subsequent struggle for the caliphate between the Umayyads and the Iraqis. The second phase began in 681 when the Umayyad caliph Mu'awiya II died and was succeeded by his brother, Yazid II. The third phase began in 683 with the death of Yazid II and the appointment of his son, Mu'awiya III, to the caliphate. The fourth phase began in 684 when the Umayyad caliph, Marwan I, died and was succeeded by his son, Abd al-Malik. The fifth and final phase began in 685 when the Umayyad caliph, Abd al-Malik, died and was succeeded by his son, Walid I.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 36645711}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Stranger in the City\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Stranger in the City was the second solo album by John Miles and was released in 1977. It was awarded BPI Silver Certification on 19 July 1977.  Recording sessions with its producer and orchestral arranger Rupert Holmes started in the summer of 1976 in the United States when Miles was promoting his first album Rebel. The bulk of the album was recorded in England. For this album, Miles recruited Australian keyboardist Gary Moberley because Miles felt that his previous album was missing something funky. Both \"Remember Yesterday\" and \"Slow Down\" charted in the UK (respectively 32 and 10) and would be the last Miles singles to chart in Britain until 1983. Although the singles did fairly well, the album itself barely cracked the top 40 of the UK chart and reaching No. 82 in Canada. However, the cut \"Slow Down\" proved to be Miles' biggest US chart hit, peaking at No. 2 on the Billboard Disco chart, No. 34 on the Billboard Hot 100 in June 1977, but just No. 68 in Canada.  \"Remember Yesterday\" was written about Bob Marshall, who was according to Miles a very romantic type, because he drifted around from girl to girl.  A track of the title song had been recorded during the sessions of Rebel and was originally planned to be released as the B-side of \"Highfly\", but was shelved. It was orchestrated by Holmes who added percussion in New York performed by recording legend Jimmy Maelen. \"Manhattan Skyline\" was written about the first impressions Miles and Marshall had of New York and was recorded entirely in Manhattan.

The film is set in Bombay (now Mumbai), India, and was shot on location there. Stranger in the City is the final film to be directed by James Ivory, the last film to be produced by Ismail Merchant, and the final film in the Merchant-Ivory Productions library. At the 2004 Cannes Film Festival, where the film premiered, Richard Gere won the prize for Best Actor. Gere plays a lonely American diamond merchant whose life is changed when he meets a lively but suspicious Indian man (played by Ben Kingsley). The two men become friends and change each other's lives. The film is a tribute to Mumbai, which Ivory has called his \"spiritual home\". In the film, Gere plays Victor Miesel, a Jewish American who is the head of a diamond company and lives with his Jewish American wife, Carmichael (and her mother), in a luxurious apartment in Mumbai, with a view of the Arabian Sea. However, his wife and mother-in-law do not get along with Victor, and his wife is having an affair with his business partner. One day, while jogging on the beach, Victor sees a Parsi-Indian man, who goes by the name \"Bombay\" (played by Kingsley), sitting on the sand, watching the ocean. The two men strike up a conversation and become friends. Bombay tells Victor that he is a wealthy man who is tired of his wealth and his arranged marriage to a Parsi woman, and that he wants to shed his identity and live as a poor man. At first, Victor does not realize that Bombay is not poor, as he lives in a luxurious apartment and drives a Mercedes-Benz. But when Victor visits Bombay's apartment, he meets Bombay's servant, who tells Victor that his master is not poor, and is still married. Undeterred, Victor continues to visit Bombay, and the two men become good friends. Bombay suggests that Victor should get rid of all his possessions and live as a poor man. But Victor cannot bring himself to do so, because of his strong attachment to his possessions and his sense of responsibility toward his business. In the end, Victor is unable to follow Bombay's way of life, and Bombay says goodbye to him. But before he leaves, Bombay tells Victor that he will always be a \"stranger in the city\" of Mumbai.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 21297214}

The former UCC and Cork Constitution player made the move from Munster and played for three years at the highest level in England, making his name in the English Premiership with Harlequins.  Following a move to Leinster, he featured in a number of Ireland squads and lined out for the Wolfhounds, as well as making his debut for the National team on the 2009 Summer tour to Canada and the USA. Ross later made his Six Nations debut in 2011 against Italy. Following that, he was a mainstay on the Irish team until 2016.  His scrummaging was widely regarded as key to Leinster's Heineken Cup & Ireland's World Cup progression to the Quarter Final in 2011.  Club career After starting his rugby career with Munster, Ross spent three years with Harlequins in England before signing for Leinster in 2009. The move back to Irish rugby was seen as a move to bolster his playing opportunities to play international rugby with Ireland. He scored his first ever professional try on 5 April 2013, in an Amlin Challenge Cup Quarter Final victory away to London Wasps.  After a career that has saw him win two Six Nations titles, represent Ireland at two World Cups as well as winning two Heineken Cups, a Challenge Cup and two PRO12 titles with Leinster, Ross confirmed that he would retire from rugby at the end of the 2016\u201317 season.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Pearl gourami\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The pearl gourami (Trichopodus leerii) is a species of gourami native to Southeast Asia.  Description These fish reach about  TL. The body is a brownish-silver colour, covered in a pearl-like pattern with a distinct black line running from the fish's head, and gradually thinning towards the caudal fin. This fish's appearance has given rise to many popular names, such as the lace gourami and the mosaic gourami.  Male specimens of this fish, typical of many gouramis, are generally larger and more colourful than their female counterparts. They exhibit bright orange colouring around the throat region, which at breeding time becomes much brighter and is used to court the female. Males also exhibit somewhat of an orange tinge in their fins, with the exception of the caudal (tail) fin. The male also has longer fins, with a more pointed dorsal fin and extended anal fin rays.  Distribution and habitat The pearl gourami is native to Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia (where it is found on the islands of Sumatra, and Borneo). It occurs in lowland swamps with acidic water. This fish prefers the top and middle levels of the water.  Species description and name Trichopodus leerii was formally described as Trichopus leerii by the Dutch medical doctor and ichthyologist Pieter Bleeker in 1852. The type was collected at Palembang in Sumatra by Lieutenant-Colonel J. M. van Leer who was a medical colleague of Bleeker's and whom Bleeker honoured in its specific name.  In the aquarium  Tank requirements A tank with a volume of 120\u00a0litres (30 gallons) or over is generally recommended for a pair of pearl gouramis, although anything above that volume is greatly recommended, since these fish may show signs of stress, abnormal aggression, and illness when confined. Preferred tank temperatures are 22\u201328\u00b0C (72\u201382F). Tanks with surfaces exposed to fresh, humid air are needed so that the pearl gourami's labyrinth organ can function correctly. As with any tropical aquarium, adequate filtration, lighting, substrate and decorations, plants, and other parts of proper care are required. This fish may be somewhat timid or shy, and should not be kept with fish that are too boisterous or aggressive. In fact, in the first several days or weeks, these fish typically show extreme shyness and timidness, spending a great deal of time hiding, regardless of tank-mates or water properties. If in proper conditions, however, they will outgrow this and become more gregarious, becoming social fish. Although somewhat hardy, pearl gouramis can be vulnerable to disease, so clean water is a must. Many gouramis display bolder behavior when the tank is furnished with plants, decorations, and ornaments which provide safe refuges for the fish in times of stress.  Breeding The pearl gourami is a bubble nest builder that uses plants to help bind together the bubbles. The water level should be reduced to 20\u00a0cm (8\u00a0in) during spawning  , and the temperature should be approximately 28\u00a0\u00b0C (82\u00a0\u00b0F) and with a pH of around 7. After spawning both adults cannot be kept together. The eggs hatch after two days and the fry become free swimming three days later (Ter Morshuizen 2007). When they commence with swimming freely the fry can be fed infusoria and brine shrimp, and a week later finely ground flakes. Freeze-dried tablets may also be fed to older fry. The temperature needs to be high (about 84\u00a0\u00b0F) and with little or no water movement. Since they are air breathers, filtration is not necessary.  The pearl gourami has a very unusual and beautiful mating dance. The male builds a nest of tiny, durable bubbles. The female takes a position under the nest and the male curves his body tightly around her, from underneath. Her body quivers while she expels a few eggs. Next he releases her and picks up the eggs in his mouth as they are sinking, then he spits them into the bubble nest. This sequence is repeated several times, until the female has laid all of her eggs.  The fry are tiny at hatching (.2 mm or smaller). The male cares for the fry, taking them into his mouth and spitting them back into the nest if they fall out. Some tend to grow faster than others, and will exhibit fratricide, eating their smaller siblings.

It is a freshwater species that can be found in rivers, lakes, and streams at a depth of up to 2 m (7 ft). The pearl gourami is a small, slender gourami, growing to a maximum length of 8.5 cm (3.3 in) TL. The body is compressed laterally, with a depth of just under half the length. The head is small and pointed, with a large mouth and upward-facing mouth teeth. The pearl gourami has a single, long, thread-like dorsal fin, with the last ray extended into a long filament. The body is pale silver in color, becoming white on the belly and below the eyes. Two rows of black spots, which are more obvious in males, decorate the body. The spots in the first row are slightly larger and more widely spaced. The second row of spots is located just behind the first row, and the spots are smaller and closer together. The first and second rows of spots merge at the tail to form a continuous line. The dorsal fin has a row of large black spots, which are also more obvious in males. The pearl gourami occurs in northern Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, southern Vietnam, and Bangladesh. It has been introduced to China, India, and Myanmar. It is a seasonal migrant, and moves between minor tributaries and main rivers throughout the year, following the rain. It can also be found in flooded fields and rice paddies. The pearl gourami is a sociable species that occurs in loose groups. It is a schooling species, and it is usually found in the middle to upper water layer. It is a carnivorous species that feeds on small crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. The pearl gourami is a seasonal breeder. It breeds in the rainy season, which varies according to location. In Cambodia and Laos, the breeding season is from May to October, while in Thailand and Vietnam, it is from July to December. The pearl gourami spawns in a nest that is built by a male. The nest is a small, round structure, made from small pieces of plants and other debris. The nest is attached to a solid surface, such as a rock or tree root. The male guards the nest and cares for the eggs. The eggs are adhesive and can be seen attached to the nest walls. The eggs are pale yellow in color and become darker yellow as they age. The eggs hatch after about 24 hours. The fry are about 2.5 mm (0.1 in) in length. They are pale yellow in color and become darker yellow as they age. The fry are cared for by the male, who guards them and feeds them. The fry grow to adulthood in about one month. The pearl gourami is a popular aquarium fish, and is one of the most common species of gourami kept in captivity. It is a peaceful species that can be kept in a community aquarium. It is a schooling species, and should be kept in a group of at least six individuals. It is a carnivorous species, and should be fed a diet of small crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. The pearl gourami is a seasonal breeder, and can be induced to spawn in captivity. The fry are about 2.5 mm (0.1 in) in length and are pale yellow in color.

Biography Paul II was the third son of Croatian Ban Paul I. He was first mentioned in contemporary sources in 1301, when he was the prince of Tropolje together with his brothers. He was also mentioned as the prince of Trogir in 1305, and of Skradin in 1311. Dissatisfied with the division of powers with his brothers, he led, together with other Croatian nobles, a rebellion against his brother, Mladen II, in a desire to gain further power. After his brother's defeat at the battle of Bliska in 1322, he however failed in his intention to inherit the position paramount power in the family, which went to his other brother, George II.  He subsequently supported Mladen III in the fight against other nobles and King Louis I, for which he received the administration of Ostrovica from Mladen III. Paul bequeathed Ostrovica to his underage son, George III, to whom he appointed his brother Gregory II as guardian.  He married the Krk princess Elizabeth Frankopan (Elizabeta Kr\u010dka) (date of birth unknown, died in 1347), with whom he had two sons, George III (also known as George I Zrinski) and Pribko, and daughter Katarina.  In 1347, Gregory II, in the name of George III, handed over Ostrovica and the Luka County to King Louis I, in exchange for the fort of Zrin and other estates in its vicinity. Both Gregory II and George III moved to Zrin, and the family was since then named after the newly acquired property of Zrin as the Zrinski family. George III was the first who used the name Zrinski.

Paul was a son of Vladimir \u0160ubi\u0107 of Bribir, a nephew of King Andrew II of Hungary, and his second wife, a member of the Czech noble family of Hrabi\u0161ic. Paul's father, Vladimir, was the son of Mihailo \u0160ubi\u0107, the son of King Paul I \u0160ubi\u0107 of Bribir, who was, in turn, a son of Knyaz Matija\u0161 of Bribir, who had been granted the title of king by the Holy Roman Emperor in 1325. Paul's half-brother was the famous Vladislav IV, Duke of Wallachia, who ruled Wallachia from 1330 to 1352. In 1322, Paul was granted the title of prince by King Charles I of Hungary. After the death of his father in 1324, Paul inherited Bribir and Omi\u0161. He was also given the islands of Bra\u010d, Hvar, and Kor\u010dula by his cousin, King Andrew III of Hungary. Paul was married to Helen, a daughter of the Serbian king Stefan Milutin. They had three sons: Gregory, James, and Peter. In 1360, the citizens of Trogir appealed to King Louis the Great to confirm their earlier privileges. In the same charter, Louis also confirmed the possessions of Paul's sons in the islands of Bra\u010d, Hvar, and Kor\u010dula. A document issued by Louis in 1361 refers to Paul's sons as \"the former Dukes of Trogir\". It is therefore possible that Paul's sons had sold their possessions in Trogir to the King before 1360.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 22041806}

Coyle.  Plot A television mini-series told the life of Christ in a version of the typical Hollywood serial film. Each episode was thirty minutes long, bringing the total running time of the series to what might have been considered an epic six hours long if the films had been shown consecutively. Filmed in color in 1951, it is notable for being one of the few American film series of that time in which Christ's face was actually shown. Since the early days of sound, American film producers had been afraid that some members of the audience would be alienated if an actor who did not fit the public's image of Christ was chosen to play the role, so virtually all had played it safe by showing Him only from the back or in long shot. Sometimes only Christ's hand would be seen. Foreign film makers, however, had no such doubts, and Christ was actually shown in such films as the French Golgotha (1935), the Mexican El Martir del Calvario (1952), and the 1953 British serial Jesus of Nazareth.  However, The Living Christ Series was not meant to be shown in movie theatres, but more as an instructional, inspirational film in churches or on Sunday-morning television. Far from being a religious epic, the series was clearly shot mostly on soundstages and on a low budget, much like a typical television program of the era shot on film. Directed by John T. Coyle, the series featured mostly unknown actors or actors who appeared mostly in B-films. A notable exception was Lowell Gilmore, who played Pontius Pilate, and whose most famous previous role was as Basil Hallward in MGM's classic 1945 film The Picture of Dorian Gray. Character actor Lawrence Dobkin also appeared in the series, and Will Wright, perhaps most famous for appearing as Ben Weaver on several episodes of The Andy Griffith Show, was cast as Herod. Martin Balsam also plays a small role. Screen unknown Robert Wilson, who would go on to practically make a career out of playing the role, portrayed Christ. Noted movie trailer announcer Art Gilmore served as narrator.  The Living Christ Series, like other similar religiously-themed films, was released by Cathedral Films. It has been released on VHS and DVD, both in separate volumes and in a boxed set.

They have an estimated 75% protein to rRNA composition compared to prokaryotic ribosomes, where this ratio is reversed. Another difference between mammalian mitoribosomes and prokaryotic ribosomes is that the latter contain a 5S rRNA. Among different species, the proteins comprising the mitoribosome differ greatly in sequence, and sometimes in biochemical properties, which prevents easy recognition by sequence homology. This gene encodes a 39S subunit protein which is more than twice the size of its Escherichia coli counterpart (EcoL24). Sequence analysis identified two transcript variants that encode the same protein.

Mutations in this gene have been associated with diseases such as Charcot-Marie tooth disease and deafness. The MRPL24 gene is located on the X chromosome at Xp22.2-p22.3, between the XIST gene and the NAPA gene. It is 4,285 base pairs in length and encodes a protein that is 94 amino acids in length. The gene has four exons and three introns. The MRPL24 protein is a component of the large ribosomal subunit, and it is involved in the assembly and operation of the ribosome. It is thought to be involved in the translation of mitochondrial genes, and it may play a role in the maintenance of the mitochondrial genome. The protein is also thought to be involved in the transport of molecules across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Mutations in the MRPL24 gene can cause Charcot-Marie tooth disease, a condition that affects the bones and teeth. People with this condition typically have symmetrical, painful bone deformities in the feet and hands, as well as hearing loss. The gene is also associated with other conditions, such as deafness, and it is thought to be involved in the development of some types of cancer. The MRPL24 gene is expressed in all tissues, but it is most highly expressed in the brain, spinal cord, and liver.

History In the 17th century the Armenian people of New Julfa built a small church named Surp Hakop Church. Surp Hakop Church is the oldest surviving church of New Julfa. It was built strictly for the religious needs of the people and did not have any kind of decorations. However, as the Armenian population in New Julfa increased, the church became insubstantial. Hence, Khoja Avedik, a wealthy silk merchant, went to the church and decided to expand the church when he could not attend a religious ceremony because the church was full. He decorated the church with lights, silver and gold chandeliers, and valuable canvases and paintings. He rebuilt the entire church using his own personal funds and named it St. Mary church. Khoja Avedik was then buried in the church after his death. Two large paintings painted by European artists have been bought by an Armenian businessman and have been donated to the church.  Architecture  The plan of the east-west rectangular church is of the type of domed halls in Armenian architecture. The building has several small arched domes, but its main dome, which has four skylights; is located in the middle of the building and is fixed on arches that rest on wide columns attached to the north and south walls.   These columns divide the interior of the church into three interconnected sections. In the eastern part of the building is the altar of the church and on both sides there are two rectangular chambers.  The materials used in the building are clay and brick. The interior walls of the building are covered with plaster, and on them are paintings with themes from the Bible. The area around the church, except for its eastern side, has a portico with twenty stone-carved columns. Arches connect all these columns.   The outer surface of the arches is decorated with glazed tiles in different colors, which adds to the beauty of the exterior of the church. There are various buildings in the churchyard. In 1848, the bell tower was built in the western part of the church and above its entrance.. Adjacent to the south side of the building is a small chapel called Stepanos. The Church of the Holy Sepulcher is located near and inside the courtyard of this church.

It is a semiregular variable with a period of 36.4 days. The star's mass is 1.31 times that of the Sun. It has expanded to 10.6 times the Sun's radius and is giving off approximately 180 times as much light. The star is a member of the galactic population of red giants. These are stars that have exhausted their hydrogen fuel and are fusing helium in their cores. The outer shell of the star has expanded and cooled, giving the star an orange or red appearance. 16 Aquarii is currently on the asymptotic giant branch of its evolution. It will eventually collapse in on itself and become a white dwarf. The star is believed to have formed around the same time as the Sun, approximately 5 billion years ago. It has a very low metallicity, meaning that it has a lower concentration of heavy elements in its atmosphere than the Sun. The star's low metallicity is a result of its formation from the gas and dust clouds that collapsed to create it. 16 Aquarii is one of the brighter stars in the constellation of Aquarius.

It is fed by a 7-round detachable single-stack magazine (an optional 5-round magazine is also available). It is specifically chambered in either .408 Chey Tac or .375 Chey Tac ammunition. CheyTac Inc. states that the system is capable of delivering sub-MOA accuracy at ranges of up to . It is based on the EDM Arms Windrunner.  Design details The CheyTac system consists of three major components:  .408/.375 CheyTac ammunition  CheyTac \"XTreme Long Distance\u2122\" Rifle  CheyTac Advanced Ballistic Computer  The CheyTac M200 Intervention is a manually operated, rotating bolt sniper rifle. It features a Picatinny rail on the top of its receiver for mounting various optical sights.  Cartridge The M200 Intervention is chambered in either the .408 CheyTac or .375 CheyTac cartridge. CheyTac specially developed the .408 CheyTac/.375 CheyTac cartridge for long-range use. The cartridge is optimized for accuracy by a balance of the rotational and linear drag, which reduces yaw and precession, and keeps the tip of the projectile pointed along the trajectory. The M200 Intervention is fed through a detachable 7 round box magazine, an optional 5 round box magazine is also available. Alternatively, cartridges can be loaded individually directly into the chamber.  Barrel The M200 Intervention uses a free floating heavy-fluted barrel, which can be quickly removed for replacement or storage and transportation, and the shroud at the rear serves as a mount for an integral folding bipod and a carrying handle.  Muzzle devices The M200 Intervention features the McArthur PGRS-1 muzzle brake, which can be used to reduce recoil. The muzzle brake is also removable and can be replaced by an OPSINC suppressor.  Buttstock  The M200 Intervention has a collapsible and retractable buttstock that is adjustable for length of pull for ease storage and transportation. The buttstock also contains an integral rear monopod, which is hinged, and can be folded up when not in use.  Day and low light optical sights There are two different day optical sights available for the M200 Intervention. The standard optical sight is the Nightforce NXS 5.5-22x56 variable magnification telescopic sight with a 56\u00a0mm objective. The alternative optical sight is the US Optics SN-9. The night vision system is the AN/PVS-14 GEN III Pinnacle monocular, which attaches to the day optic using the Monoloc device. An AN/PEQ-2 infrared laser provides additional lighting in low-light conditions. The device is attached to a titanium strut.  Accessories  The M200 Intervention comes with a portable advanced ballistic computer, laser rangefinder binoculars and meteorological and environmental sensor package. All these components, together with the sniper rifle, are part of the CheyTac Long Range Sniper System (LRSS) and are linked to the ballistic computer. It provides all necessary data and calculations for accurate long range firing. Advanced Ballistic Computer \u2013 The CheyTac Advanced Ballistic Computer (ABC) System software package uses tabulated bullet flight data derived from high speed Doppler radar test sessions, and mathematical models to predict ballistic trajectory. It runs on Windows Mobile 2003 and receives input from the Kestrel handheld weather station and Vector IV laser rangefinder binoculars. However, much like other ballistic prediction software, when rounds are used for which no Doppler Radar-established bullet flight data is known, the ABC System relies solely on mathematical ballistic models. Printed data tables are available for manual use. Meteorological and environmental sensor package \u2013 The KESTREL 4000 (or, 4500 NV) meteorological and environmental sensor package measures the wind speed, air temperature, air pressure, relative humidity, wind chill, and dew point. The KESTREL 4500 NV model is compatible with night vision devices.  Laser rangefinder \u2013 The Vector IV mil spec laser rangefinder measures distances up to , and houses a digital compass and class 1 eye safe filters.  Accuracy  CheyTac states that \"the CheyTac LRRS is a solid anti-personnel system to .\" The primary intent of the .408 is as an extreme range anti-personnel system. Groups of  at ,  at  and  at  have been consistently obtained.  Groups of  at  and  at  have also been obtained. All groups that are up to  are less than 1 minute of angle for vertical dispersion.  Variants The CheyTac Intervention comes in several variants:  M200 (29 in (737\u00a0mm) barrel length)  M200 Carbine (Now out of production)  M200 CIV (Civilian Variant)  M200 RK  M310 (Single shot and repeater sub-variants all with 29 in (737\u00a0mm) barrel length)  M310 R (Repeater)  M325 (Single shot, repeater and tactical sub-variants all with 28 in (711\u00a0mm) barrel length) The main capability differences between the different variants are governed by barrel length which determines the obtainable muzzle velocity. Higher muzzle velocity extends the effective range of a rifle, everything else being equal. The M200 and the M200 Carbine are limited to official customers like military forces and come with a detachable box magazine and a telescopic stock, whilst the other variants have a glass-fiber fixed McMillan A5 stock and are available for the general public.

It is an advisory body, financed by public money, and devoted to technology assessment. (The abbreviation \u00abTA\u00bb which is used to describe TA-SWISS stands for Technology Assessment, and reflects the activities of the Centre.)  Mission The object of the Foundation for Technology Assessment TA-SWISS is to follow technological changes and developments and to identify the social, legal and ethical consequences of new technologies. Another element of its mission is to encourage the discussion of scientific and technological challenges.  The recommendations that result from TA-SWISS projects are used to assist the decision making process, and are intended for the Swiss Parliament and the Federal Council. Depending on the topics covered, these recommendations may also be of interest to other groups, such as professional associations, commercial enterprises, universities and stakeholder groups, as well as public administrations. The media, in their role as disseminators of information, are also kept regularly informed about the activities of TA-SWISS.  TA-Swiss is full member of the European Parliamentary Technology Assessment (EPTA) network and is a founding member of the German speaking Network NTA (Netzwerk Technikfolgenabsch\u00e4tzung).  Activities The activities of the Foundation for Technology Assessment TA-SWISS are further divided into two areas:  1. Studies (interdisciplinary scientific analyses) Recent studies have covered the following topics:  Flexible new world of work (2014)  Prenatal genetic diagnostics (2014)  Synthetic Biology (2014)  Deep geothermal energy (2014)  Personalised Medicine (2013)  Nano and Environment (2013)  Electromobility (2012)  Robotics (2012)  Localisation Technologies (2012)  Human Enhancement (2011)  Biomass fuels \u2013 second generation (2010)  Indicator-based decision-making systems (2010)  Nanofood (2009)  Anti-aging medicine \u2013 myths and chances (2008)  2. Participative projects (consultations aimed at gathering the views of citizens) Numerous events have been organised within the scope of the participative projects \u2013 PubliForums, publifocus and other forms of dialogue, for example:  publifocus \u00abMedical treatments\u00bb (2012)  Dialogue \u00abThe Internet and me\u00bb (2010)  World Wide Views on Global Warming (2009)  publifocus eHealth and the electronic patient file (2008)  History Experimental beginnings: TA-SWISS began its work in 1992. Following a number of parliamentary interventions, the Federal Council assigned the Swiss Science and Technology Council the task of developing a system of technology assessment for Switzerland over a four-year pilot phase (1992\u20131995).  Institutionalisation of technology assessment: In its Message relating to the promotion of training, research and technology for the years 1996-1999, the Federal Council defined the bases for the institutionalisation and financing of technology assessment in Switzerland. In 1999, technology assessment was firmly fixed in the law on research. In this way, the Federal Council reinforced the independence of TA-SWISS, which until 2007 was affiliated to the Swiss Science and Technology Council.  In 2008 a change in the law on research conferred the legal basis on the incorporation of the mandate for TA-SWISS within the Association of Swiss Academies of Arts and Sciences. Accordingly, since 1 January 2008 TA-SWISS has been a Centre for Excellence of the Swiss Academies of Arts and Sciences.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Union representative\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "A union representative, union steward, or shop steward is an employee of an organization or company who represents and defends the interests of their fellow employees as a labor union member and official. Rank-and-file members of the union hold this position voluntarily (through democratic election by fellow workers or sometimes by appointment of a higher union body) while maintaining their role as an employee of the firm. As a result, the union steward becomes a significant link and conduit of information between the union leadership and rank-and-file workers.  The duties of a union steward vary according to each labor union's constitutional mandate for the position. In general, most union stewards perform the following functions: Monitor and enforce the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement (labor contract) to ensure both the firm and union worker are not violating the terms of the agreement. Ensure that the firm is in compliance with all federal, state and local laws and regulations. Represent and defend fellow workers whom the firm believes violated company policy or the terms and conditions of the collective bargaining agreement, often through the grievance process. Communicate and disseminate official union policy, memos and directives to workers in the shop. Popularize and promote union consciousness and values in the workplace.  Shop steward  Unlike other union representatives, stewards work on the shop floor, connecting workers with union officials at regional or national levels.  The role of shop stewards may vary from being a mere representative of a larger national union towards independent structures with the power of collective bargaining in the workplace.  In the United Kingdom, a network called Shop Stewards Movement organised shop stewards against the first World War. In Germany, a network of shop stewards called Revolutionary Stewards took an important role in the revolutionary \"January Strike\".

The Union shall provide the Home with a written list of such stewards and alternates, if any.  (b) Union stewards shall be permitted to use a reasonable amount of work time with pay, as approved in advance by the Administrator (which approval will not be unreasonably denied), for the purpose of handling and processing grievances.  (c) The Union steward shall not direct any worker how to perform or not perform their work, shall not countermand the order of a supervisor and shall not interfere with the normal operations of the Home or any other worker.  (d) The Home's designated representative shall be required to meet with only one Union steward and/or the Union Chairperson on any grievance.  5.7 Handling of Contract Matters.  The Union Chairperson(s) will be allowed up to four scheduled hours per week (or more if needed) with pay to handle matters under this contract, provided that it does not interfere with patient care or with the operating needs of the Home.

In British and Irish trade unionism, the representative is generally known as a shop steward. The representative's role is to ensure that the employer implements the collective bargaining agreement and to campaign for better terms and conditions for the workers they represent. If there is a dispute between workers and the employer the union representative will try to resolve the dispute, and if this is not possible will help to organize a strike or other industrial action. In the case of a strike the representative is generally known as a picket captain. A union representative is normally a member of the bargaining unit, and is seen by the workers as having the same interests as the workers they represent. However, in some cases the representative is not a member of the bargaining unit, but is nonetheless appointed by the union to represent the workers. This is often the case for employees such as teachers, who are generally not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, but have a union representative to represent their interests. In the United States, a union representative is generally known as a business representative, and is more likely to be an official of the union than a member. In the UK, a union representative is generally known as a shop steward. The term \"shop steward\" is thought to have originated in the 1880s, when workers in the UK first began to be represented by trade unions. At that time, the representative was generally known as a \"check-weighman\", because it was the representative's job to check that the weight of the goods being loaded and unloaded from a ship was accurate. The term \"shop steward\" came into use in the early 20th century, when the representatives began to be more directly involved in representing the workers. The term was used to describe someone who was seen to \"stand up\" for the workers they represented. The role of the shop steward is to ensure that the employer implements the collective bargaining agreement, and to campaign for better terms and conditions for the workers they represent. In the UK, shop stewards are generally not paid for their work, but are reimbursed for expenses incurred in representing workers. In the United States, business representatives are generally paid for their work. The amount of pay varies from union to union, but is generally a flat hourly rate or a percentage of the union's membership dues.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2965467}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Hanky Panky (Madonna song)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "\"Hanky Panky\" is a song by American recording artist Madonna from her soundtrack album I'm Breathless. It was released on June 12, 1990, by Sire Records as the album's second and final single. Written and produced by Madonna and Patrick Leonard, the song was developed from a line in the parent film, Dick Tracy, talking about a woman who enjoys being spanked by her partner. Performed in an almost comical style, \"Hanky Panky\" is a jazz and swing song with a changing bassline and minor to major key-shift in the chorus. It caused some controversy in Ireland because of its innuendo and racy lyrics, with women's groups deeming them as harmful; Madonna later clarified that the lyrics were intended as a joke.  The song garnered positive response from music critics, many of them highlighting its lyrical content. It was a commercial success, becoming a top-ten hit in many countries including Australia, Ireland, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States while topping the chart in Finland. Madonna has performed the song on two of her concert tours: Blond Ambition (1990) and Re-Invention (2004). The song has been covered by several tribute acts and was also performed on the television series Ally McBeal (1997).  Background and release In 1990, Madonna starred in the film Dick Tracy as Breathless Mahoney\u2014a new role introduced for her\u2014with Warren Beatty, her boyfriend at the time, playing the titular character. After the shooting for Dick Tracy was over, Madonna started working on the soundtrack. She had begun recording three songs written by Stephen Sondheim for the film\u2014\"Sooner or Later\", \"More\" and \"What Can You Lose\"\u2014which would be part of the album, but also had to write and develop new songs comparable in style to her previous releases. She produced the entire album, including the Sondheim songs. \"I want people to think of me as a musical comedy actress. That's what this album is about for me. It's a stretch. Not just pop music, but songs that have a different feel to them, a theatrical feel\", she said at the time.  Madonna recruited producer Patrick Leonard and engineer Bill Bottrell to help her with the project. She and Leonard toiled to create music that would fit the style and production of the film, set in the days of the Untouchables law enforcement. \"Hanky Panky\" was written and produced by Madonna and Leonard and was released as the second and final single from I'm Breathless on June 12, 1990. The cassette and the 7-inch versions had \"More\", another song from the album as its B-side, while the 12-inch releases had two remixes of the song by Kevin Gilbert. Cover photograph for the single was done by Patrick Demarchelier with Jeri Heiden designing the sleeves.  Recording and composition  \"Hanky Panky\" was recorded within the three weeks time taken for the whole project. Personnel working on the song included Leonard on keyboards, Jeff Porcaro on drums, Guy Pratt on bass and Donna De Lory, Niki Haris and N'Dea Davenport on background vocals. Lyrically, the song deals with sadomasochistic themes and is centred around a girl who celebrates the pleasures of a \"good spanking\". It is performed in an almost comical style and stemmed from a line in the film, where Breathless says to Tracy, \"You don't know whether to hit me or kiss me\". The track has a false introduction and starts slowly with piano, but changes after a few moments into a large jazz and swing song, with a changing bassline and minor to major key-shift in the chorus. According to the sheet music published by Musicnotes.com, the song is set in common time, with a tempo of 170 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of D minor, with Madonna's vocals spanning from B3 to D5. The song has a basic sequence of Dm\u2013C\u2013Bm\u2013A7sus in the beginning and changes to Dm\u2013A\u2013B9\u2013A7\u2013Dm\u2013C when the swing starts. During an interview with Rolling Stone, Madonna explained: The spanking thing started because I believed that my character in Dick Tracy liked to get smacked around and that's why she hung around with people like Al Pacino's character. Warren [Beatty] asked me to write some songs, and one of them\u2014the hanky-panky song\u2014was about that. I say in the song 'Nothing like a good spanky', and in the middle, I say, 'Ooh, my bottom hurts just thinking about it'. When it came out everybody started asking, 'Do you like to get spanked?' and I said: 'Yeah. Yeah, I do'. The singer had to tone down some of the suggestive lyrics to please the officers at Disney, the producers of Dick Tracy, who were worried about their image. In Ireland, the song was subject to controversy after two women's organizations accused Madonna of glorifying violence against women, specifically on the line \"I'll settle for the back of your hand\"; one of the groups, the National Women's Council of Ireland, labelled the song \"highly dangerous\" while the other group, Ireland's Women's Aid, said the line was \"extremely harmful\". Although initially approving of the idea of \"getting spanked\"\u2014even admitting her fondness on The Arsenio Hall Show\u2014Madonna later backed down from the theme of spanking, explaining that the lyrics were written as a joke and believed that it was instead her character Breathless Mahoney that liked to get spanked. She added that it should have been obvious that the song was humorous in nature since Madonna believed her image was more of a dominant person who took charge, contrary to the song's characterization.  Critical response  J. Randy Taraborrelli, author of Madonna: An Intimate Biography, commented that \"the steamrolling 'Hanky Panky' simply sounds like a silly innocent romp until you realize what she's going on and on is about ('Warren's favorite pastime')... being spanked!\". The author also felt Madonna sang with \"just a little too much authority\". Academic Georges Claude Guilbert, author of Madonna As Postmodern Myth, called it \"a comic hymn to spanking\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic described it as a \"double entendre-laden hit\". Bill Coleman from Billboard called it a \"steamy and suggestive jumpin' jive\". Music critic Robert Christgau highlighted \"Hanky Panky\" as one of the best tracks on I'm Breathless; calling it a \"fake period piece\" but praising its \"risqu\u00e9 s&m-lite\" sound as \"all her\". Ernest Hardy from Cash Box said it \"is a tribute to the pleasures of light S&M, done in a brassy '30s style. Madonna sings in a lower key than ususal, tosses off risque lines, and heads for the top of the charts with barely an effort.\" David Giles from Music Week stated that it \"finds Madonna flirting in a big way with Forties swing music.\" He added, \"Pure Hollywood stuff\". Rolling Stones Mark Coleman wrote that the song, alongside \"Cry Baby\" and \"I'm Going Bananas\", was one of the \"more-legitimate sounding and confidently sung show tunes without a trace of disco\" on the album. He also noted that \"its titles alone are enough to conjure up visions of the elaborate production numbers on Madonna's summer tour.\" People magazine called it a \"paean to kink\". Billboards Keith Caulfield called it \"goofy (but catchy!)\". In August 2018, Joel Lynch from the same magazine ranked it as the singer's 100th greatest song, calling it an \"enjoyably (and cartoonishly) amorous big-band swing song\" and comparing Madonna's vocals to Betty Boop. Greg Sandow, from Entertainment Weekly, called it a \"delightful challenge to censorship\". Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine felt it was a  \"cheeky\" song, also writing that it touched on themes Madonna would go on to explore more explicitly later in the 1990s.   Stephen Holden of The New York Times described it as a \"big-band blues [song] in which she endorses sexual spanking [...] a calculated bid for outrage\". Ray Boren from The Deseret News described \"Hanky Panky\" as \"naughty\", comparing it to the 1928 jazz song \"Makin' Whoopee\" by Eddie Cantor. Dave Tianen from The Milwaukee Sentinel, while reviewing I'm Breathless noted that \"one aspect of Madonna remains constant even when you push her back in time. 'Hanky Panky' is one of the few pop tunes to explore the erotic entertainment value in a good spanking.\" For Medium's Richard LaBeau, \"it gets points for its boldness and audacity. Yet it never truly rises above its novelty status\". Writing for The Pittsburgh Press, Peter B. King believed that the subject matter of \"Hanky Panky\" would surely receive \"flank\", but defended Madonna saying that she had been singing about such topics for years by then. The Huffington Post ranked the song fifth on their list of \"The 13 Most Underrated Madonna Songs\"; author Pandora Boxx hailed it as \"a great fusion of '90s pop and vintage '30s\", but noted that \"its 'scandalous' subject matter ruffled too many feathers to make it a big hit\". Also from The Huffington Post, Matthew Jacobs ranked it at number 55 on his list of \"The Definitive Ranking of Madonna Singles\", calling it \"pure fun, '30s swing style [...] its lyrics are sillier than they ought to be, but the fabulous beat refuses to let your dancing shoes collect dust\". Writing for Gay Star News, Joe Morgan gave a mixed review, calling it \"less sexual and feminist liberation and more corny and blatant [...] A forgettable number that sounds like track six of a musical theatre cast album\". A negative review came from Royal S. Brown, author of Film Musings: A Selected Anthology from Fanfare Magazine, who called it \"ridiculous\". Also negative was The Guardians Jude Rogers, who wrote that \"even creators of brilliant pop can go wrong\", calling it \"over farty\" and \"Madonna's nadir\".  Chart performance Following its release, \"Hanky Panky\" was initially blacklisted at some radio stations when they faced objections from audiences about the lyrical content. Nevertheless, it debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 40 the week of June 30, 1990, as \"Vogue\" was descending from the top ten. The single quickly climbed up the chart, ultimately peaking at number ten the week of July 28, 1990. It was eventually certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on September 19, 1990, for shipments of 500,000 copies. Billboard ranked it at number 36 on their list of \"Madonna's 40 Biggest Hits\" on the Hot 100. In Canada, the song debuted at number 92 on the RPM Top Singles chart, and reached a peak of number 18 on the week of September 1, 1990. It was present for a total of 13 weeks on the chart.  In the United Kingdom, the song debuted at number 14 on the UK Singles Chart and after two weeks, reached its peak of number two the week of July 27, 1990; spent a total of nine weeks within the top 100 of the chart. It was certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on August 1, 1990, for shipments of 200,000 copies. According to the Official Charts Company, the single has sold over 210,000 copies as of October 2010. In Australia, \"Hanky Panky\" debuted at number 18 on the ARIA Singles Chart the week of July 29, 1990, and peaked at number six four weeks later. It was ranked at number 45 on the ARIA year-end chart. In New Zealand, the single debuted at number 23 on RIANZ Singles Chart and, after fluctuating for the next three weeks, reached a peak of number six, becoming Madonna's 18th top-ten single in the country. In the European nations, \"Hanky Panky\" reached the top-ten of the charts in Ireland, as well as topping the charts in Finland. In other countries such as Austria, Belgium, Germany, Spain, Switzerland and the Netherlands, it managed to peak within the top 20 of the charts.  Live performances and covers  \"Hanky Panky\" was first performed on Madonna's third concert tour, the Blond Ambition World Tour of 1990. She performed the song dressed in a green and white striped vaudeville-style corset, playing the part of a nightclub singer, standing in front of a microphone. Near the end of the performance, Madonna joked: \"You all know the pleasures of a good spanking, don't you? [...] When I hurt people, I feel better, you know what I mean?\". Regarding the \"shameless promotion\" of Dick Tracy in this segment, author Lucy O'Brien said that \"along with her yen for artistic expression, Madonna has always had an eye on the bottom dollar... [But] the Dick Tracy section is the least dynamic part of the show\". Two different performances  were released on video, the first was included in Blond Ambition Japan Tour 90, taped from the performance at Yokohama Stadium in Yokohama, Japan, on April 27, 1990, and the other once included on Blond Ambition World Tour Live, taped at the Stade de l'Ouest in Nice, France, on August 5, 1990.  Fourteen years later, Madonna performed an energetic showgirl themed version of \"Hanky Panky\" as part of her 2004 Re-Invention World Tour. She appeared onstage dressed in a circus themed outfit, consisting of black hot pants, red high heels, headband and a red and white striped 1920s flapper  style bustier. Sean Piccoli, from the Sun-Sentinel, praised the singer's ability to \"summon the vampy humor of 'Hanky Panky'\u2014a Bette Midler moment if ever [Madonna] had one\". In May 2000, the song was performed by actress Alicia Witt on the third-season finale of the American television series Ally McBeal, titled \"The Musical, Almost\". An Indie cover version by the band Killer Nannies In America, was included on the 2000 tribute album The Material Girl: A Tribute to Madonna. The Gary Tesca Orchestra included an instrumental version of the song on their album Who's That Girl: The Madonna Story, Vol. 1 (2006).

The song was not as commercially successful as the previous singles from the album, but it reached number one in Finland, Israel and the United States dance charts. \"Hanky Panky\" was released after the Erotica album's lead single, \"Justify My Love\", was not as commercially successful as expected, and after the second single, \"Erotica\", was banned by American and British radio stations for its sexually explicit content. The song was written by Madonna, Shep Pettibone and Tony Shimkin, while production was handled by Pettibone. \"Hanky Panky\" is a pop song with a house music influence, and was described as a \" dance pop anthem\" by Madonna's official website. The title refers to a slang term for a woman who is easily seduced, while the lyrics describe a woman who is so irresistible that she can make a man \"break [his] religion\" and \"leave [his] wife\". Pettibone's production features a sample from an old gospel record, and a \" modernist, almost electronic texture\". Pettibone used a Korg M1 music workstation for the track. The music video was directed by Mark Romanek, and was filmed in Los Angeles. It features Madonna as a sexually tempting witch, dancing in front of a cathedral, while the minister tries to resist her advances. In the end, the minister is defeated and joins Madonna in her dance. The video was banned from American television due to its sexual and religious imagery. The video was included on Madonna's video collection Erotica, and was released as a promotional single from the album. \"Hanky Panky\" received positive reviews from music critics. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine described it as \"the most fun\" song on Erotica, and also the most \"ACCESSible [ sic ]\". J.D. Considine, writer for The Rolling Stone Album Guide, called it a \" wonderfully silly record\" and \"the album's most lighthearted moment\". Don Shewey, writer for Blender, called it a \"zippy, house-inspired number\". Bret Adams, writer for the book The 100 Best Singles of the 90s, described it as \"delicious\" and \"wickedly clever\".", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 3732808}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"When God Writes Your Love Story\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "When God Writes Your Love Story: The Ultimate Approach to Guy/Girl Relationships is a 1999 book by Eric and Leslie Ludy, an American married couple. After becoming a bestseller on the Christian book market, the book was republished in 2004 and then revised and expanded in 2009. It tells the story of the authors' first meeting, courtship, and marriage. The authors advise single people not to be physically or emotionally intimate with others, but to wait for the spouse that God has planned for them. The first edition was packaged with a CD single by the Ludys: \"Faithfully\", a song they had written specifically to accompany the book.  The book is divided into five sections and sixteen chapters. Each chapter is written from the perspective of one of the two authors; nine are by Eric, while Leslie wrote seven, as well as the introduction. The Ludys argue that one's love life should be both guided by and subordinate to one's relationship with God. Leslie writes that God offers new beginnings to formerly unchaste or sexually abused individuals.  Other American Christian authors, such as Mark Matlock and Jason Evert, wrote highly of When God Writes Your Love Story. Leah Andrews of the Lewiston Morning Tribune compared When God Writes Your Love Story to other popular Christian books providing alternatives to dating, including Joshua Harris's I Kissed Dating Goodbye and Boy Meets Girl. Eastern University Christian studies professors Margaret and Dwight Peterson responded to the Ludys' book by writing an essay called \"God Does Not Want to Write Your Love Story,\" in which the Petersons argue that the book makes young people see marriage as a fantasy comparable to that of Disney Princesses, and that this fantasy often results in disappointment. Rick Holland, an instructor at The Master's College and Seminary and pastor of College and Student Ministries at Grace Community Church, criticized the Ludys' description of dating, claiming it was based too much on anecdotes and not enough on the Bible.  Background When God Writes Your Love Story, first published in the United States in 1999,  is the third book written by Eric and Leslie Ludy, an American married couple. Like the Ludys' previous two books, His Perfect Faithfulness: The Story of our Courtship (1996) and Romance God's Way (1997), its major themes are romance and Christianity; it tells the story of the authors' first meeting, courtship, and marriage. After becoming a bestseller on the Christian book market, When God Writes Your Love Story was republished in 2004 and then revised and expanded in 2009. More than 350,000 copies were sold worldwide by 2009. Translations of the book have been published in Spanish, German, and Traditional Chinese.  Eric and Leslie Ludy met when Eric was 21 and Leslie was 16. They pursued a friendship for several months before starting to court, and married in December 1994, the same month that Eric turned 24. In When God Writes Your Love Story, the Ludys advise single people not to be physically or emotionally intimate with others, but to wait for the life partner that God has planned for them; the Ludys suggest that one should marry this person rather than independently choosing a mate. Also focusing on premarital physical and emotional purity, the authors do not discuss the physical processes of sexual activity. Like many other Christian books about premarital romantic relationships, the Ludys' book explicitly does not present a set of rules to follow or a strategy for romantic success, but rather gives readers a framework for pursuing Christian romantic relationships; the book is intended to be a tool in the creation of the reader's unique romantic relationship rather than as a blueprint explaining what all Christian romantic relationships are supposed to look like.  Before the book's release, it was endorsed by Leslie and Les Parrott, authors of Saving Your Marriage Before It Starts; Beverly LaHaye of Concerned Women for America; and Joe White, President of Kanakuk Kamps. The first edition was packaged with a CD single by the Ludys: \"Faithfully\", a song they had written specifically to accompany the book, with lyrics discussing the beauty of having a life partner.  Content The book is divided into five sections and sixteen chapters. Each chapter is written from the perspective of one of the two authors; nine are by Eric, while Leslie writes seven, as well as the introduction. The first section, \"Desiring a Love Story\", addresses sexual desire and lovesickness, suggesting that temporary relationships cannot fulfill those longings. Section Two, \"Preparing for a Love Story\", advances ways in which one might, before initiating a romantic relationship, develop the characteristics of a good spouse. The next section, \"Waiting for a Love Story\", discusses the practice of fidelity to one's future spouse before meeting them by way of sexual abstinence and argues that waiting indefinitely is worth it even if one's soulmate never arrives. In the fourth section, \"Sweetening a Love Story\", the Ludys provide advice on how to proceed once the possibility of a romantic relationship has presented itself. The final section, \"Discovering a God-written Love Story\", argues that it is never too late to give God control of one's love life, and that this sacrifice should be made not in expectation of personal benefit but rather to benefit one's future spouse and to honor God.  Early in the book, Eric retells a portion of Homer's Odyssey, describing the episode in which Ulysses sails near the land of the Sirens: creatures whose song so attracts seafarers that they sail towards them and crash on the rocks. In this story, Ulysses orders all his men to fill their ears with beeswax and then tie him to the mast; the ship therefore sails through the area unharmed. Still, Ulysses, hearing the Sirens' song the entire time, is tortured by its beauty and his inability to get to the song's source. Eric follows this story with a retelling of the story of Orpheus's encounter with the Sirens. In this story, Orpheus's solution is to play a \"sweeter song\" than that of the Sirens; his ship also passes unharmed, his men so entranced by his song that they do not notice the Sirens. Eric then argues from analogy that, normally, those who force themselves to resist premarital sexual and romantic temptations are likely to find the process torturous (like Ulysses), while those who listen to the plans God has for them find waiting for marriage much easier (as it was for Orpheus's crew). Eric expands on the concept of the \"sweeter song\" throughout the book and often refers to it. Another frequently mentioned concept in the book is \"the beautiful side of love\"; the Ludys use this phrase to refer to a lasting, satisfying romance and contrast this state with such other experiences as breakups, unrequited love, and sexual frustration.  The Ludys argue that one's love life should be both guided by and subordinate to one's relationship with God. They suggest that, \"if God's plan and purpose for you is marriage, then the person you will one day marry\u00a0... is alive and wandering the earth\" and that this knowledge should encourage people to act in such a way that their future spouses would be pleased. The Ludys contest the definition of \"true love\" as an emotion; instead, they define \"true love\" as the choice to commit to another person no matter what happens. Eric writes that \"there are two ways each of us can approach life: spending our days meeting our needs or looking for ways to meet others' needs. The mystery is that when we spend our life focused on our own needs, we are never satisfied\u00a0... but when we pour out our life and focus on how we can serve others\u00a0... our deepest needs are met as well!\"  Leslie argues that non-permanent relationships involving physical or emotional intimacy (or both) result in long-term psychological pain and that one should therefore only become physically or emotionally intimate with one's spouse. Eric retells the Greek myth of the suitors of Penelope, in which Penelope, whose husband Ulysses is erroneously believed to be dead, resists a large number of marriage proposals until Ulysses returns and kills the suitors. Eric uses the story to suggest that one should be faithful to one's future spouse even if it appears that they will never arrive. Eric argues that selfless service is an important part of marriage. He therefore suggests that a good way for a man to make himself ready for his future spouse is to serve his mother and sisters, and that single women should practice serving their fathers and brothers. Leslie writes that she is commonly asked the question \"How will I know when a relationship is from God?\" and her response is that people are likelier to recognize that a relationship is from God when they have a \"team\u00a0... made up of godly people who can keep us accountable to our commitments, pray with us, and provide a refreshing outside perspective.\" She indicates that this team should include one's parents or, if one does not have living Christian parents, other Christians of an older generation. She writes that God offers new beginnings to formerly unchaste or sexually abused individuals.  Critical response  Discussions of context  When God Writes Your Love Story is a popular Christian book that provides alternatives to dating. For this reason, Leah Andrews of the Lewiston Morning Tribune compared the book to Joshua Harris's I Kissed Dating Goodbye and Boy Meets Girl. When God Writes Your Love Story also contains Evangelical sexual abstinence teachings. Christine Gardner, a communications professor at Wheaton College, investigates such teachings in Making Chastity Sexy: The Rhetoric of Evangelical Abstinence Campaigns, and discusses the Ludys' book as part of this investigation. Gardner writes that she interviewed a twenty-two-year-old woman who had read When God Writes Your Love Story and \"desperately wanted God to write her love story, but she thought that she would help him out by filling in the blanks.\" Gardner argues that the result \"was a fractured fairy tale, one without a happy ending.\"  In the journal Critical Research on Religion, Courtney Ann Irby of Loyola University Chicago writes that the Ludys disparage secular American culture as overtly sexual and thus an obstacle to Christians. According to Irby, secular beliefs about dating are negatively presented in When God Writes Your Love Story and hookup culture is consistently discussed, although Irby indicates that, since the publication of the Ludys' book, some scholars have disputed the prevalence of casual sex in the United States. Irby suggests that the Ludys have no discernible qualifications to speak on the issues they discuss, but rather justify their message by emphasising their own personal experience as the reason for their authority. She writes that the Ludys recognize their lack of expertise and therefore emphasize trusting God as being more important than learning from the specific stories in the book. Irby suggests that the Ludys' book is, in these respects, similar to many other Evangelical books about premarital romantic relationships, such as Dannah Gresh's And the Bride Wore White, Elisabeth Elliot's Passion and Purity and Quest for Love, Don Raunikar's Choosing God's Best, Ben Young's and Sam Adams' The Ten Commandments of Dating, Henry Cloud's and John Townsend's Boundaries in Dating, Alex Chediak's 5 Paths to the Love of Your Life, and Joshua Harris's I Kissed Dating Goodbye and Boy Meets Girl.  Christian responses to the book's advice  Christine A. Col\u00f3n and Bonnie E. Field, two single women in their thirties, expressed their frustrations with the Ludys' book in Singled Out: Why Celibacy Must Be Reinvented in Today's Church. Col\u00f3n, an English professor at Wheaton College; and Field, a former English professor at Wayland Baptist University, criticize Leslie Ludy's account of her own wait for God to bring her a romantic partner. They argue that \"the language Ludy uses to describe her time of waiting and trusting implies a difficult and long struggle that is finally rewarded by God\" and suggests that a long wait results in an even greater reward, a concept that Col\u00f3n and Field, despite acknowledging as commonplace, disagree with and trace back to William Shakespeare's Cymbeline, which states \"the more delay'd, delighted.\" Singled Out suggests that, because Leslie was only 16 when she met Eric, her story is unlikely to inspire hope in older singles.  Col\u00f3n and Field compare When God Writes Your Love Story to Derek Prince's God Is a Matchmaker, and argue that Prince's book better expresses the concept that God allows some people to receive their soulmates quickly, while requiring others to undergo a long wait. While the Ludys' book suggests that it is worth waiting for a soulmate because the wait indicates a better prize, Col\u00f3n and Field favour Prince's reasons for advocating waiting for one's soulmate, which are that doing so tests one's faith and that \"God has required many of His choicest servants to wait long periods for the fulfillment of His promise or purpose.\"  Margaret and Dwight Peterson, an American married couple who are Christian Studies professors at Eastern University, teach a course together called \"Christian Marriage\" and were very critical of When God Writes Your Love Story. They responded to the Ludys' book by writing an essay called \"God Does Not Want to Write Your Love Story.\" They write therein that, while they read When God Writes Your Love Story, \"it began to dawn on us with particular clarity how different these stories of romance are from any traditionally Christian understanding of marriage.\" In response to Leslie Ludy's recommendation that a single woman should seek to be God's princess until becoming the princess of a human prince, the Petersons argue that this analogy makes young people see marriage as a fantasy comparable to that of Disney Princesses, and that this fantasy often results in disappointment. While referencing When God Writes Your Love Story specifically on several occasions, the Petersons acknowledge that the Ludys' book is one of many books with this premise and write that \"it is the entire genre that is problematic.\"  Rick Holland, an instructor at The Master's College and Seminary and pastor of College and Student Ministries at Grace Community Church, criticized the Ludys' description of dating, claiming it was based too much on anecdotes and not enough on the Bible. Nonetheless, he commended the couple on the relevant Bible verses they do quote and he argued that the advice the Ludys share in the book is sound and that their story is an encouraging one.  When God Writes Your Love Story was received positively by some American Christian authors. In Freshman: The College Student's Guide to Developing Wisdom, Mark Matlock, an ordained minister and youth pastor recommends When God Writes Your Love Story to college students. He describes the Ludys' book as funny, honest, and candid. Jason Evert, a Catholic author and chastity speaker, wrote positively of When God Writes Your Love Story in his book If You Really Loved Me: 100 Questions on Dating, Relationships, and Sexual Purity. Evert commends Leslie Ludy writing about the importance of listening intently and regularly to God's voice in seeking discernment about romantic relationships. Also in If You Really Loved Me, Evert praises a passage from When God Writes Your Love Story in which Leslie Ludy recalls having spoken with a group of young men who all agreed that the most desirable women were those who were slow to establish strong emotional attachments to potential romantic partners, and that the least desirable women were those who were emotionally promiscuous. According to Evert, these men are right; he uses the passage to support his argument that lack of sexual experience is attractive.  Commentators have also noted the song \"Faithfully\" that accompanied the book. The Petersons criticized it, arguing that its lyrics suggest that singles should seek a kind of unachievable perfection in their future marriage and spouse. On the other hand, in Eyes Wide Open: Avoiding the Heartbreak of Emotional Promiscuity, Brienne Murk, a Christian musician and public speaker, identifies \"Faithfully\" as one of her favourite songs.  In 22 and Single: A Coming of Age Story, Katie Kiesler wrote that, after reading the first chapter of When God Writes Your Love Story, she stopped because \"it was too hard to hear about the wonderful way in which God brought another perfect couple together \u2014 because it wasn't happening for me.\" She wrote that her friends kept recommending the book to her, even after she had tried starting it. She eventually decided that the reason she didn't like the book was her own selfishness in seeking to fulfill her own desires rather than leaving her desires for God to work out. She then read the book again, and wrote that God used her reading of it to make her thankful for her time as a single person. She also wrote that she found the book to be \"mostly about letting God's love overflow into all areas of your life rather than tales of perfect Christian couples.\"  In 2012, Clear Choices Pregnancy Resources Center, an American pro-life crisis pregnancy center operated by Christians in Grayson County, Kentucky, offered a course on the topic of sexual integrity that employed When God Writes Your Love Story and two other Christian books as its basis, the other two being Gary Chapman's The Five Love Languages and Bill and Pam Farrel's Single Men Are Like Waffles \u2014 Single Women Are Like Spaghetti.

I wanted him to be kind, funny, smart, tall, and good-looking, just to name a few. But I also wanted him to be a spiritual leader. I wanted him to be a man who would love God more than he loved me. I think that's a lot to ask of a guy. I'm not sure I would have been able to answer that description at 22. I was certainly not a spiritual leader at that point in my life. I'm not even sure I knew what that meant. Looking back, I can see now that I was asking for a man who was farther along in his spiritual journey than I was. I wanted a man who was closer to God than I was because I knew that if I was going to spend the rest of my life with a man, I wanted him to be a man who would lead me closer to God, not away from Him. So I think it's interesting that here I am, at 33, and I'm living my own love story that I wrote for myself when I was 22. The man I'm married to is kind, funny, smart, tall, good-looking, and he's a spiritual leader. I'm not talking about a spiritual leader in the sense that he's the pastor of a church or a Bible study leader. I'm talking about a man who is growing closer to God every day and who is leading his family closer to God. When I was 22, I didn't think I would find a man who was as spiritually mature as I was. But here I am, married to a man who is much farther along in his spiritual journey than I am. He challenges me to be a better Christian. He leads our family in prayers at dinner and he leads us in reading the Bible every day. In my love story, I didn't just marry a man, I married a spiritual leader who is helping me become a better woman of God. And the amazing thing is that I'm not the only one who is learning from my husband. My husband is learning from me, too. We are both growing closer to God together and it's amazing. So here's the thing: God is writing your love story, too. If you're not married, He's writing your story. If you are married, He's writing your story. Maybe you're not married to a spiritual leader. Maybe you're not married to a man who is challenging you to be a better Christian. But I can promise you this: God is writing your love story and He will give you the man who is right for you. If you're not married, don't settle for a man who is not growing closer to God. Don't settle for a man who doesn't make you a better Christian. And if you are married, don't settle for a man who is not growing closer to God. Don't settle for a man who doesn't make you a better Christian. Because here's the truth: God is writing your love story and He will give you the man who is right for you. When God writes your love story, it's going to be a story that challenges you to be a better Christian. It's going to be a story that helps you grow closer to God. It's not going to be a story that leads you away from God. It's not going to be a story that makes you less of a Christian. So don't settle for anything less than what God has for you. Because when God writes your love story, it's going to be a story that's worth reading.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 38835199}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Quimbanda\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Quimbanda () is an Afro-Brazilian religion practiced primarily in the urban city centers of Brazil. Quimbanda practices are typically associated with magic, rituals with Exus, and Pombagiras spirits. Quimbanda was originally contained under the religious tradition of Macumba. In the early years of the 21st century some began to assert that Quimbanda was totally separate from Umbanda. Umbanda represented the more Europeanized traits of the religion. Quimbanda has continued to insist that it is a distinct religion, while rejecting Catholic and Kardecist Spiritist influences that have penetrated Umbanda and other Afro-Brazilian religions.  Spirits  Exus   In Quimbanda the male spirits are known as Exus, they are considered very powerful spirits. Note that they are not the same as the Eshu/ Elegua of Lukumi Elegua/ Santeria; as Quimbanda has evolved as a religion, it has created a category of spirits collectively called Exus, whose name was borrowed from the deity Exu. Exus refers to the phalanx of spirits. Religious professor Kelly E. Hayes outlines the purposes of Exu spirits:  \"[Quimbanda] is associated particularly with the cultivation of a set of powerful spirit entities called Exus, referred to by their devotees as guardians. Exus, commonly referred to as \u2018spirits of the left\u2019, are not purely evil. Instead, they are more human-like in their qualities and share in human weaknesses. Exu spirits primarily deal with human and material matters as opposed to the \u2018spirits of the right\u2019 used in Umbanda, who deal with primarily spiritual matters. Exus are typically called for rituals to arrange rendezvous, force justice, or keep life balance. From inside of the cult, Quimbanderos instead affirm that Exus cover both Spirit and Matter, and that They simply consider pointless to stick only to one of them. According to the lore provided by trained sorcerers, Exus has a stern and high morality, They simply accept to help people into delicate matters too, like seduction and vengeance, but never with the uninterest in morality and ethic often attributed to them by outsiders.  Pomba Giras   Another set of deities associated with Quimbanda are not directly derived from the Yoruba religious tradition: Pomba Giras, the female counterparts of Exus. Prominent Pomba Giras such as Pomba Gira Maria Mulambo, also known as \u2018Maria of the trash\u2019, are used for specific rituals often relating to their names.  refers to someone who is wearing ragged clothing or someone who is very unlucky. Therefore, Pomba Gira Maria Mulambo is summoned to overturn or destroy someone and make them a . A legend about Maria Mulambo says that she drew her title from the fact that she gave up her richness as a princess, so to marry her non-rich lover, and join him to help the poor, before her angry husband had her murdered; because of this, it is not a good idea to ask her to attack somebody without a good reason, for Pomba Giras have devious ways, but a firm (yet crooked to outsiders) morality.  Ogum   Ogum is the orisha of warfare and metal. Ogum is also known as the Lord at the center of the crossroads. Rituals involving Ogum are typically less aggressive and more justice-bound than that of Exu. Professor David J. Hess speculates that Ogum acts as an intermediate figure between the rituals of Exu in Quimbanda and the rituals of Umbanda, revealing the deep connection between Quimbanda and Umbanda.  Practices  Rituals  A classic Quimbanda ritual, called a , consists of several parts: a motive, dedication to a spirit, a marginal location, the metal or clay (earthy) material, an alcoholic drink, scent, and food (usually a peppered flour-palm oil mixture, sometimes called ). An example of a  is as follows:  Trabalho 1: \" A work of great force, under the protection of [Exu] Tranca Ruas das Almas (Block-Streets-of-the-Souls), to eliminate an enemy. \" 1) Go to a crossroads of Exu on a Monday or Friday near midnight, if possible in the company of a member of the opposite sex; 2) greet Ogum with a bottle of light beer, a white or red candle, and a lighted cigar; 3) greet Exu Sir Block-Streets-of-the-Souls by opening seven bottles of rum () in the form of a circle, lighting seven red and black candles, and offering seven cigars; 4) put inside a vase () and mix the following: manioc flour (), palm oil (), and peppers; 5) put on the ground in the center of the circle the name of the person whom one wishes to hurt, and, using a knife, stab this with violence, asking Exu to attend to one's request.\"  Depending on the purpose of the ritual, aspects of the trabalho will change. For instance, if one desires to seek justice from Exu they will use white candles, rum and a written request. Therefore, certain colors denote different motives in a ritual: white symbolizing an honest and justice-bound motive and red and black representing an aggressive and illicit motive. Other rituals substitute the harsh or spicy smell of cigars for the sweet smell of carnations, thus symbolizing the transformation between harming and helping rituals. Likewise, rituals involving female spirits (Pomba Giras) are less aggressive in their performance. A  to obtain a woman is as follows: Trabalho 7: \"to obtain a woman. \" 1) On a Monday or Friday night, go to a female crossroads (T-shaped rather than plus-shaped) and greet Pomba Gira by pouring a little rum, or better yet, champagne or anisette (); 2) place two pieces of cloth () on the ground, one red and the other black, and on top of this put five or seven red roses in the shape of a horseshoe; 3) fill a cup of good quality with champagne or anisette; 4) put the name of the desired person in the cup or in the center of the horseshoe; 5) sing a  (song) and thank Pomba Gira.\"  Particular elements of an Exu trabalho remain unchanged in the Pomba Gira  and therefore mark Pomba Giras as the female counterparts of Exu: the colors, the location (male to female variation), the time of day, the day of the week, the scent (smoky), and the container for the food and the flour/palm oil mixture. In a Pomba Gira , another set of elements indicates a gentler coding: from rum to champagne or anisette, from the absence of flowers to red roses, from pepper in the flour/palm oil mixture to honey, and from a fierce initiatory act to a song, which seems to suit the purpose of the ritual: to obtain a woman. (See Table One for the transition between Exu and Pomba Giras rituals)  Table One: Differences Between Exu and Pomba Gira Rituals  Marginal Locations  \u2018Marginal locations\u2019 refer to areas containing magical and spiritual significance where rituals are executed. Many Quimbanda rituals are performed at crossroads, as Exu is the Lord of the seven crossroads and Ogum is the Lord of the center of the crossroads. Other marginal locations include the streets at night (since Exus are referred to as \u2018people of the streets\u2019), cemeteries, beaches, and forests, all during the nighttime.  Animal Sacrifices   In certain rituals with Kiumbas (aspiring to become Exus), devotees offer sacrificial pigeons, hens, roosters, goats, sheep, and bulls to help a spirit progress in power and capability. Other rituals use animal sacrifices to enlist the help of a spirit to carry out a deed.  History  From Africa to Brazil  Quimbanda originated in South America and developed in the Portuguese Empire. The Atlantic slave trade brought African cultural presence to the Americas. In Brazil, by the mid 19th century the slave population outnumbered the free population. The slave population increased when free men of African descent (libertos) were added to the slave population. The African culture brought by slaves to Brazil slowly mixed with the Indigenous American and European culture. In the large urban centers such as Rio de Janeiro, where the African-slave population was the most concentrated, the Colonial regime enforced a social control system to suppress the rising population. However, instead of suppressing the African slave population, the Colonial regime\u2019s system had the opposite effect; the system divided the slave population into \u2018nations\u2019, which preserved, protected, and even institutionalized African religious and secular traditions. The large cities where the slave population was most concentrated preserved Macumba, the forerunner of Quimbanda, and still hold the largest following of Quimbanda.  Catholic Influence  The Catholic Church has had very little lasting effect on Quimbanda unlike other Afro-Brazilian religions such as Umbanda. The Catholic Church in Brazil was under the direct control of the Portuguese crown so it relied on the state to provide funds, resulting in a very understaffed clergy in Brazil. Subsequently, the main Catholic influence in Brazil was a lay brotherhood. Therefore, the Catholic Church received only a nominal conversion of the African slaves. Ironically, the Catholic Church adopted the Colonial crown\u2019s system of controlling the slave population, which in turn preserved African traditions.  From Macumba to Quimbanda and Umbanda  Before Quimbanda became its own separate religion, it was contained inside the religious tradition of Macumba. During the late 19th century and into the mid 20th century, Macumba was a pejorative term for all religions deemed by the white-dominant class as primitive, demonic and superstitious black magic. However, as African culture continued to blend with the native Brazilian culture, Macumba morphed into two religions: Umbanda and Quimbanda. Umbanda represented the \u2018whitened\u2019 aspects of Macumba, drawing heavily on spiritual and hierarchical values of French Spiritism and Catholicism. On the other hand, Quimbanda represented the aspects of Macumba that were rejected in the whitening process, becoming \u2018the Macumba of Macumbas\u2019. The split between the black and white magic of Macumba has caused much debate over the unity or disunity of Quimbanda and Umbanda. Some believe that Quimbanda and Umbanda represent aspects or tendencies of a single system. Others believe that Quimbanda and Umbanda have morphed into their own religions with their own influences and beliefs.(see Table Two for differences between Quimbanda and Umbanda)  Table Two: Differences Between Quimbanda and Umbanda  The emergence of Quimbanda  Until halfway through the 20th century, Quimbanda and other Afro-Brazilian religions were not considered to be religions at all. Instead, they were considered to be primitive, superstitious magic passed down intergenerationally from an African-slave past. The black consciousness movement and the women\u2019s movement of the late 1970s created the perfect environment for the emergence of Quimbanda. These movements helped acquire civil liberties during Brazil\u2019s long process of returning to democracy. Historians refer to this process as \u2018re-Africanization,\u2019 meaning the \"intentional assertion of aesthetics, theologies, and practices considered more African.\" The re-Africanization movement caused increased popularity and respect for Exus and Pomba Giras spirits previously viewed as illicit and demonic. Thus, the emergence of Quimbanda showed the Afro-Brazilian culture salvaging their traditional African religion from white-dominant class misinterpretations of superstitious black magic. This re-Africanization movement simultaneously protected Quimbanda from the prevalent ideology of \"whitening\" that influenced other Umbanda and other eclectic Afro-Brazilian religions.  Contemporary  Quimbanda has had a quickly rising membership since its emergence in the 1970s, especially in urban areas of Southern Brazil. However, according to Brazil\u2019s 2000 census less than 1% of the population claimed to belong to Afro-Brazilian religions (including Quimbanda and Umbanda). Although very little of the Brazilian population claims to follow Quimbanda, many people from all social ranks use Quimbanda rituals occasionally. It is a common practice for businessmen to consult Exus before major business dealings.

It is a synthesis of African, indigenous American, and European beliefs and techniques. Quimbanda is similar to the Cuban Santer\u00eda in its mixture of African and Catholic elements, and to Haitian Vodou in its use of spirit possession. However, it is different from these traditions in that it is not as widely followed, and it has no well-defined structure or initiation ritual. In Portuguese, the word quimbanda means \"an accumulation of odd or useless objects\". The word is related to the Portuguese word quimbo, meaning \"trance\", and was originally used to refer to the spiritual and magical traditions of the African slaves who were brought to Brazil and other parts of the Americas during the Atlantic slave trade. In Quimbanda, the practitioners (known as \"Quimbandareyas\" or \"Quimbandeiros\") believe that every object, every person, and every event has a magical and religious significance. They can use these elements in their rituals. The goal of the ritual can be to heal, to harm, or to ask for some kind of protection or blessing. The practices of the Quimbanda are not well defined, and they are not performed according to a fixed ritual. A Quimbanda ritual can be as simple as a practitioner asking the spirits for some kind of blessing, or it can be a long and complex ceremony, with many offerings and invocations. The spirits that are invoked in Quimbanda are known as \"Quimbos\". The Quimbos are represented by objects, which can be anything from a stone to a piece of paper with a drawing or writing on it. The Quimbos can be offered sacrifices, such as food or drink, and they can be invoked with a ritual knife (which is called a \"Quimbanda knife\" or \"Quimbanda machete\"). The Quimbanda practitioners believe that the Quimbos can help them with any kind of problem, and they can also be used to cause harm to other people. However, the practitioners also believe that they can be punished by the Quimbos if they use them for harmful purposes. There are many different Quimbanda traditions, and some of them are more well-defined than others. Some of the traditions are focused on healing, while others are focused on harming. Some of the traditions are more structured, with initiation rituals and specific rules, while others are more flexible and open to interpretation. The most well-known Quimbanda tradition is the \"Quimbanda de Umbanda\", which is a tradition that developed in the early 20th century and is focused on healing and protection. This tradition is followed by many people in Brazil and Portugal, and it has a well-defined structure and initiation ritual. The \"Quimbanda de Umbanda\" is a tradition that is closely related to the Umbanda religion, and it is often practiced by the same people who follow Umbanda. However, it is not necessary to follow Umbanda in order to practice Quimbanda, and many people who practice Quimbanda do not follow any other religion.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1767459}

The pronunciation of the name () does not entirely follow High German pronunciation rules. The second vowel sound is written like the alternative High German spelling of an umlaut-\u00fc sound (), but it is pronounced like a normal u sound (, as in English pool).    Due to the non-standard German origin of the name, it is often misspelled or mispronounced even by Germans, if they are unfamiliar with the dialect.  Origin and distribution   In today's Germany, the name Niehues can be found mostly in the regions where the Westphalian dialect is or was spoken, predominantly in the adjacent cities and districts M\u00fcnster, Coesfeld, Steinfurt, Recklinghausen, Borken and Unna in the northwest of Germany close to the border of the Netherlands.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Sisters of the Infant Jesus\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Sisters of the Infant Jesus, also known as the Congregation of the Holy Infant Jesus or the Dames of Saint-Maur, is a Roman Catholic religious institute, dedicated to education and the training of underprivileged schoolchildren. They were founded in Rouen, France, in 1666, as part of the work of Nicolas Barr\u00e9, a Minim friar and Catholic priest (1621-1686), who had gathered some young women for the free instruction of the poor in 1662.  Today, the Infant Jesus Sisters and their lay volunteers have a presence worldwide through social projects and schools. They are also known as Dames of St.-Maur, from the address of their major house in Paris.  The foundation of Barr\u00e9's schools and of the Sisters suggested to St. John Baptist de La Salle the idea of accomplishing a similar work for boys, resulting in his founding of the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools.  History  Origins  In 1659 Barr\u00e9, who was a respected scholar within his Order, was sent to the monastery of the Order in Rouen. He became widely known as a preacher and his sermons attracted a large audience. In 1662 Barr\u00e9 saw the need for the education of the poor in France.  France in the late 17th century was suffering from the effects of the Franco-Spanish War (1635\u20131659) and a terrible plague. As a result of his efforts to promote a planned parish mission in the nearby village of Sotteville-l\u00e8s-Rouen, Barr\u00e9 came to see the suffering of the local population. To enable parents to attend the mission, Barr\u00e9 asked two young women to come and help with the children. One was a local resident, Fran\u00e7oise Duval, 18 years old, the other was Marguerite Lestocq, then aged 20, who, like him, was from Amiens and with whom he had family connections.  He saw the need to make basic education more accessible to all. There were hardly any schools for girls and very few for boys. Most primary school teachers were poorly educated and religious education was almost non-existent; there was profound ignorance of the Catholic faith. In 1662, half the children in Rouen died of famine. Many were homeless and wandered the streets as beggars and, for some, prostitution became one of the few means of livelihood available.  They began to give daily classes to young girls in a room which they were allowed to use, spending that year in this work. Soon three other young women joined them, and two separate schools were opened. Barr\u00e9 would visit the classes frequently, guiding the young women in how to teach and deal with both the children and their parents, drawing upon his own rigorous education under the Jesuits and his experience as a professor. He taught them the value of \u201cinstruction and education\u201d and from the beginning he trained the young teachers to respect the uniqueness of each child and to develop each one\u2019s potential. The teachers were to speak in a humble, gentle and simple manner so that even the youngest could understand, and they were to teach only what they themselves had adequately grasped.  As the enrollment increased, more schools were established, and four years later, the ladies in charge of these schools began to live in a community under a Superior. This was the beginning of a religious congregation whose main work was the education of the poor.  The year 1666 saw the founding of the Congregation of the Sisters of the Infant Jesus. After several years of teaching in the schools, the five young women were invited by Barr\u00e9 to consider becoming part of a committed community. After some reflection, they felt that they were indeed called to this way of life and agreed. These women were not bound by religious vows or confined to a cloister. They were free to serve the local community and provide free education for poor children. They committed themselves to this in a legal document drawn up in 1669, becoming called the Charitable Teachers of the Infant Jesus (). As part of their living in trust in God, it was established that the material needs of the schools were to be handled by women outside the new community.  Expansion and division Due to his declining health, in 1675 Barr\u00e9 was sent to the Minim monastery in Paris. Though limited in his activities, he promoted new foundations of his \"charitable schools of Providence\", starting with two, Saint Jean en Gr\u00e8ves and Saint Nicolas des Champs, training teachers, both men and women for them. He urged his teachers not to wait until pupils arrived at the school; they were to seek out especially those who might be at risk. He also set up trade schools so that girls could earn a living. Again, the education offered was to be entirely free and any profit derived from the pupils\u2019 work was to go to them.  In 1677 Barr\u00e9 began to send teachers to other locations in France, starting with his native Picardy, reaching as far as New France in North America. These women were not part of a religious institute, and so were free to serve their local communities as needed, without the barriers that status would have imposed at that time.  Around that time, he acquired a house located on the Rue Saint Maur in the 6th arrondissement of Paris (now called the Rue de l'Abb\u00e9 Gr\u00e9goire), which was to become the motherhouse of the Institute. In 1677 a convent was established in Rue Saint Maur, Paris (ii) and the Sisters were subsequently known as the \"Dames of St. Maur\". In 1678, Barr\u00e9 founded a novitiate for the sisters on the Seine.  The Daughters of Providence were members of a Catholic religious congregation for women founded in 1643, by a pious widow, Marie Polaillon (n\u00e9e de Lumague) under a Rule of Life drawn up by Vincent de Paul. The Daughters would profess annual vows of obedience, chastity, service and stability. In 1681 several houses of the congregation merged with the Sisters of the Congregation of the Holy Infant Jesus, becoming the Sisters of St. Maur and of Providence. A number of \u2018Little Charitable Schools\u2019 were established throughout France. In 1683 Mother Fran\u00e7oise Duval, one of the foundresses, was sent to open a school in Lisieux. At the time of Barr\u00e9's death in 1686, there were over 100 schools being operated by the Sisters of the Holy Infant Jesus throughout France.  Throughout his life, Barr\u00e9 had refused to allow the schools to accept benefices as a means of support, determined to place his trust in God alone, and was followed in this commitment by the teachers of the Institute. Upon his death, however, the lay trustees in Paris and Rouen, who were in charge of the finances of the schools and the teachers who staffed them, strongly disagreed over whether or not to continue this practice.  This was eventually referred to the royal court, and, in 1691, King Louis XIV divided the Institute into three independent groups, with motherhouses in Rouen, Paris and Lisieux.  The Sisters in the original communities became known as the Sisters of Providence of Rouen and in 1921 became a congregation of diocesan right, under the authority of the local bishops where they served, with a missionary outreach in Madagascar and Central Africa. The group based in Lisieux also became a diocesan congregation. The Sisters of St Maur in Paris became an institute of pontifical right with communities in five continents.  Current era The French Revolution closed all the schools of the institute and it was not until 1805 a new community of teachers was formed by seven surviving members. Less than twenty-five years after the opening of the motherhouse in Paris, eighty schools for free education and forty boarding schools had been established in France. With the granting of official approval from Rome, the Sisters extended their work to America, England, Spain, Malaysia, Japan and Thailand. The new growth of the Institute was such that, by the mid-19th century, schools were opened in Spain and Asia. 'Sisters of the Holy Infant Jesus (Dames of Saint Maur) were among the pioneer missionaries in British Malaya, Japan and Thailand. In 1887, after over 200 years of service without the taking of religious vows, this congregation of Sisters became a religious institute of pontifical right, able to operate independently worldwide.  Southeast Asia In 1849 a Catholic missionary in the Straits Settlements, Reverend Father Jean-Marie Beurel, a native of Saint-Brieuc in France, suggested to the colonial governor, William John Butterworth, that it might be worthwhile to found a charitable organisation for girls next to the Church in Victoria Street. In August 1852, Beurel bought the house at the corner of Victoria Street and Bras Basah Road. Beurel then appealed to the Superior General of the congregation in France for Sisters to run a school.  Malaysia Four Sisters were sent to the East. After a long and perilous voyage, one had died at sea, three of them landed at Penang in April 1852. That same year, the three Sisters established a convent that contained an orphanage and school in Penang. In September 1852, the Congregation sent four Sisters to Penang, with Mother Mathilde Raclot in charge, to guide and support the group of sisters who had arrived earlier. The school, Convent Light Street (Malay: SMK Convent Lebuh Light), is Penang's oldest girls' school and has occupied its current site along Light Street near historic George Town for over 150 years. While on the peninsula, the Sisters continued establishing schools with help from the local community such as Kuala Lumpur's oldest girls' school Convent Bukit Nanas and the only Chinese convent girls school Convent Datuk Keramat in Penang. In 1952, St Bernadette's convent school was built in Pusing Road, Batu Gajah Perak with land donated and funds raised from communities. During World War II, the Japanese invaded Malaya and either took over or closed down many such mission schools, notably the iconic Convent Primary School in the hills of Tanah Rata. The Tanah Rata convent is one of the few in the region which still contains an operating school and a church. Today, CHIJ schools can be found in most states and many major cities and they continue to educate local girls of all races and religions.  Singapore  In February 1854, three Sisters led by Rev. Mother Mathilde Raclot arrived in Singapore from Penang and set up the convent in Singapore at Victoria Street. Soon they also started a Convent Orphanage and a Home for Abandoned Babies as they found day-old babies were being left at their doorstep.  To raise funds for their work, Mother Mathilde taught needlework to her fellow nuns and their students, and they sold their products to the wives of the local Chinese merchants. The school became well-known and within ten years, the enrollment had increased to 300. Secondary education began in 1905. Under Mother Hombeline, the expansion programme continued.  The convent occupied a full street block bordered by Bras Basah Road, Stamford Road, Victoria St and North Bridge Road. The iconic church was deconsecrated during the 1980s. Part of the Sisters' quarters has been demolished and converted into SMRT Corporation offices. Most of the original buildings were redeveloped as part of the Heritage Board's preservation scheme. The complex has since been redeveloped into a high-end retail complex called CHIJmes while the church is now a popular attraction for tourists and those interested in history.  The eleven CHIJ schools in Singapore can trace their history to the Victoria Street convent. Satellite schools were founded before and after World War II. The \"original\" convent school is the present-day CHIJ Secondary and CHIJ Primary schools in Toa Payoh. CHIJ Saint Nicholas Girls' School (CHIJ SNGS) was co-located on the same site and functioned as the Chinese section while CHIJ Secondary and Primary were English-medium. After the abolition of vernacular schools, CHIJ SNGS was granted SAP status. All three schools moved out of the Victoria Street complex during the 1980s into larger and more spacious facilities.  East Asia  Japan In 1872, Mother Mathilde led the first group of French nuns to Japan and founded the Saint Maur International School in Yokohama, where they teach and cared for the disadvantaged Japanese women and children. Mother Mathilde Raclot died, aged 97, in 1911 whilst still in Yokohama, Japan, and buried there.  Europe The shortage of English teachers forced the Sisters to turn to the British Isles in hopes of recruiting and training potential missionary teachers. In 1909, Mother St Beatrice Foley, who had returned from Singapore, established Drishane Convent in Ireland. It had a \"knitting school\" for younger girls and was also used to train teachers for the Asian mission. Less than half a decade after opening, the convent was churning out teachers and Sisters and sending them to Asia and South America.  South America The Sisters first set foot in South America during the 1960s. Some of the Spanish-speaking Sisters arrived in Peru in 1967 and have since expanded to several other countries in the continent.

In 1970 a federation was established between the congregations of Paris and Rouen to facilitate a greater sense of cooperation and common identity. In 2007 a revival of the original form of life was established, one open to both women and men, called the Fraternity of the Infant Jesus, whereby they can live and serve in the spirit of Barr\u00e9.

The congregation's members are called Infantines. They are dedicated to the Christ Child and strive to live in the spirit of the infant Jesus, making themselves \"instruments of the love of Christ the Infant\" in their ministry to the church and the world. The congregation was founded in Lyon, France, on Christmas day in 1822, by Saint Pauline Marie Jaricot, who was inspired by the spirituality of Francis de Sales. The institute was established in response to the anti-clericalism and rationalism of the times, in order to revive the faith and strengthen the Church. The sisters' first ministry was the education of poor girls. Today, they also minister to the needs of the elderly, the infirm, and the neglected, in the spirit of Christ, \"the friend of the friendless\". In 1824, the congregation was formally established and recognized by the Church. The sisters' first house of congregation was in Lyons. From there, the congregation expanded to Paris and then to the rest of France. In 1839, the sisters were called to England, where they established a house in Manchester. In 1840, they went to Portugal and opened a house in Lisbon. The Sisters of the Infant Jesus have been called \"the most significant women's congregation to be founded in the early nineteenth century\". As of 2015, the congregation consisted of about 3,000 sisters, serving in over 80 countries. The Sisters of the Infant Jesus have been awarded the Templeton Prize for the Progress of Religion, the highest honor for a living person or group in the field of religion.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 12114116}

Kalki's birthday is observed on the Dwadashi of the Shuklapaksha of the Bhadrapada month as per the traditional Hindu calendar, while in Gregorian calendar it is the twelfth day of the waxing phase of the moon. It is said to be celebrated on August 3, 2022 and August 22, 2023. This festival is mainly celebrated by the Vaishnavas of the Vaishnavism tradition in Hinduism.  Significance   Kalki is said to be born in the village of Shambala, to a Brahmin family, whose parents are Vishnuyasha (father) and Sumati (mother). This event commences at the end of Kali Yuga, which is described that when Kalki grows up and becomes a warrior, he rides a Divine white horse named Devadatta with a blazing sword, accompanied by a talking parrot, Shuka, who knows everything; the past, present and future. He then goes around the world to fight evil kingdoms and especially Kali, who is a demon that has the powers of a yogi to control beings and makes them commit Adharma. He then restores Dharma and returns to his homeland, heaven or Vaikuntha.  Celebration  During the festival, the devotees wake up early in the morning, take a bath before sunrise, fast and recite the Vishnu Stotram, either in the temple or at home. At home, they recite the Narayana Mantra and other mantras 108 times. The performance of the pooja (worship) starts with the Beej mantra, where then an offering of a seat to the Lord (asana) takes place, whereby in the further process, the idol is washed spiritually with water and panchamrita, with the offering of flowers, diya and incense. The worshippers would then either donate food to the Brahmins, the needy ones or both.

The festival is observed on the last Friday of the Hindu month of Bhadrapada, which falls between August and September. The festival is also known asGrey Thursday, as the day is marked by fasting and a day-long silence by the devotees. The fast is broken after sunset with the offering of an orange flag to the deity. Devotees offer special prayers and perform aarti. A feast is then served. The festival is observed by several communities, including the Vaishnava community, in India. It is primarily observed in the states of Karnataka, Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Telangana. It is also observed by the Telugu community in the state of Andhra Pradesh. In the state of Maharashtra, the festival is observed by the family of the 18th century saint, and the founder of the Pushtimarg sect, Gopalan Bhatta, at the Gopalan Bhatta Math in Maharashtra. The festival is also observed by the families of other Pushtimarg saints, such as the family of Santa Rampaul at the Santa Rampaul Math in Richardson, Texas, United States. In the state of Gujarat, the festival is observed at the Swaminarayan Temple in Rajkot. In the state of Karnataka, the festival is observed at the Sri Basaveshwara shrine in the village of Avani in the state of Karnataka, and at the Sri Kalishvara temple in the village of Kollur in the state of Karnataka.

Content The book starts with an autobiographical account of Ryan's childhood in Janesville, Wisconsin, up to the point when he found his alcoholic father's dead body when he was sixteen. He reveals that he used government assistance to survive during that period.   He goes on to explain that this tragedy motivated him to work harder and eventually run for office. He then explains how he handles congressional bills and politics in general, including his experience as a vice presidential nominee in 2012. He stresses the idea that civil society, not government, is what leads to job creation and growth.   Ryan goes on to argue that Republicans should stop preaching to the choir and start reaching out to new voters like Hispanics and African Americans.  Critical reception  The book was only sold as an e-book on Amazon.com until Ryan complained about it on television. It was then sold at a discounted price with a quick shipping period.  In The National Review, George Will praised the book, suggesting it was a response to President Barack Obama from \"a man who has a better mind and better manners\". Similarly, Peter Wehner of Commentary Magazine described it as \"both candid and self-reflective, and at times even self-critical\".  Writing for The American Conservative, Ross Kaminsky suggested, \"It is not an election tell-all, nor a screed intended to rile up the right-wing or harangue Democrats.\" He added, \"Ryan's book is reasoned and explained well enough that even the mainstream media is having a hard time criticizing it.\" He concluded that the book was \"a welcome and valuable addition to our ongoing political conversation\". In The Washington Post, Matt Miller compared it to \"drooled-upon pages of Ayn Rand\". However, he agreed with Ryan that health-care expenditure would have to be curtailed.

Some species are well-known parasites, including Dirofilaria immitis, the dog heartworm, Dirofilaria repens, which affects many types of nonhuman mammals, and Dirofilaria tenuis, which usually parasitizes raccoons, but can infect humans, as well.  Human dirofilariasis is generally caused by D. immitis and D. repens.  The former can cause pulmonary dirofilariasis, which may have no symptoms.  Another form of the infection can be characterized by a painful lump under the skin or infection of the eye.  The nematodes are spread by mosquitoes.  Etymology From Latin d\u012brus 'fearful; ominous' + f\u012blum 'thread', Dirofilaria is a genus of nematodes of the superfamily Filarioidea. The first known description of Dirofilaria may have been by Italian nobleman Francesco Birago in 1626 in his Treatise on Hunting: \u201cThe dog generates two worms, which are half an arm\u2019s length long and thicker than a finger and red like fire.\u201d Birago erroneously identified the worms as a larval stage of another parasite, Dioctophyme renale. The dog heartworm was named Filaria by American parasitologist Joseph Leidy in 1856, and the genus was renamed Dirofilaria by French parasitologists Railliet and Henry in 1911.  Taxonomy Species in the genus include:  Dirofilaria acutiuscula Dirofilaria aethiops Dirofilaria ailure Dirofilaria asymmetrica Dirofilaria cancrivori Dirofilaria conjunctivae Dirofilaria corynodes Dirofilaria desportesi Dirofilaria fausti Dirofilaria freitasi Dirofilaria genettae Dirofilaria hystrix Dirofilaria immitis \u2013 dog heartworm Dirofilaria indica Dirofilaria louisianensis Dirofilaria macacae Dirofilaria macrodemos Dirofilaria magalhaesi Dirofilaria magnilarvata Dirofilaria pongoi Dirofilaria reconditum Dirofilaria repens Dirofilaria roemeri  Dirofilaria tawila Dirofilaria tenuis Dirofilaria timidi Dirofilaria uniformis Dirofilaria ursi  References This article uses public domain text from the CDC as cited  Spirurida Secernentea genera", "machine_text": " Dirofilaria is a genus of parasitic nematodes in the family Onchocercidae. They are parasitic in the arteries and veins of the thoracic and abdominal cavities, and are mostly found in dogs and other canids, but can also infect cats and wild carnivores. They are distributed in many countries worldwide, but are most prevalent in areas with large numbers of stray and wild dogs, such as in Asia, Africa, and South America. In dogs, the disease is characterized by a chronic inflammation of the affected vessel, and in rare cases, it can be fatal. The most common species in this genus is Dirofilaria immitis, which can be found in both dogs and cats. It is also known as the American Heartworm. The second most common species is Dirofilaria repens, which is found only in dogs and wild canids, and is restricted to the northern hemisphere. The third species, Dirofilaria ursi, was originally described as a separate genus, but is now considered to be a sub-species of D. immitis. Dirofilaria is a long, thin, thread-like worm, with a length of up to 30 cm (12 in) and a width of 1 mm (0.039 in). The body is composed of a series of segments, each of which is separated by a set of small rings. The head contains a pair of sensory pits and a pair of mouthparts. The tail end is tapered and has a small set of hooks. The life cycle of Dirofilaria species is complex, and involves a number of different hosts. In the case of D. immitis, the first stage is the bite of the infected mosquito. The parasite then makes its way to the small arteries and veins in the thoracic and abdominal cavities, where it matures and mates. The female worm then produces eggs, which are carried to the outside of the body by the blood circulation. These eggs are ingested by a mosquito, which then bites another animal, transmitting the parasite to the new host. In the case of D. repens, the life cycle is slightly different. The parasite is transmitted directly from one host to another by the bite of an infected mosquito. The parasite then matures and mates in the small arteries and veins of the thoracic and abdominal cavities, and the female worm produces eggs. These eggs are carried to the outside of the body by the blood circulation, and are ingested by a mosquito, which then transmits the parasite to a new host. The clinical signs of dirofilariasis can vary depending on the species of parasite and the severity of the infection. In dogs, the most common symptoms are a chronic cough, difficulty breathing, and fatigue. In cats, symptoms may include a chronic cough, difficulty breathing, and weight loss. In rare cases, the infection can cause death. The diagnosis of dirofilariasis is based on the identification of the parasite in the blood or tissue samples of the infected animal. This can be done by using a microscope to search for the characteristic long, thin, thread-like worms. Alternatively, a blood test can be performed to look for the presence of antibodies to the parasite. Treatment of dirofilariasis is complex and involves a number of different steps. The first step is to kill the adult worms in the body. This can be done using a combination of drugs, such as mebendazole and pyrantel, which are given orally for several weeks. The next step is to remove the dead worms from the body. This can be done using a procedure called \"extraction therapy\", which involves inserting a needle into the infected tissue and withdrawing the worms. In addition to these treatments, it is also important to prevent the infection from spreading to other animals. This can be done by controlling the population of mosquitoes in the area, and by vaccinating dogs and cats against the parasite. The prognosis for animals with dirofilariasis is generally good, provided that the infection is diagnosed and treated early. In most cases, the symptoms will resolve within a few weeks of treatment, and the animal will make a full recovery. In rare cases, the infection can be fatal.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 22834521}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Karl Stromberg\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Karl Sigmund Stromberg is a fictional character and the main antagonist in the 1977 James Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me. Stromberg was portrayed by Curd J\u00fcrgens. The character Stromberg was created specifically for the film by writer Christopher Wood. Ian Fleming's novel The Spy Who Loved Me was not told from Bond's perspective, but, rather, a Bond girl who is in love with him. The entire plot of the film has actually nothing to do at all with the plot of the novel. This was at Fleming's request; when he sold the rights to his novel to Eon Productions he requested only the title be used.  Biography  The webbed-fingered Karl Stromberg is a successful self-employed businessman as head of his own shipping firm and chain of laboratories. Stromberg's obsession and passion is the ocean where he lives in his palace, named Atlantis, that could submerge itself underwater so as not to be seen or detected. Located off the coast of Sardinia, Italy, Atlantis has everything to support life above and below water for any length of time. In fact, Atlantis is more like a city, able to support dozens if not hundreds of people. Stromberg also owns a huge tanker, named Liparus, that serves as his headquarters away from Atlantis. Aboard the tanker he has a small army of red soldiers. In Christopher Wood's novelisation of the film, Stromberg is Swedish and his first name is \"Sigmund\".  Scheme Although Stromberg has a passion for the ocean and its various species, he despises the human race, not unlike Jules Verne's Captain Nemo. Stromberg, however, is much more diabolical and has no interest in benefiting the world. He has a congenital condition in which his hands are webbed like those of aquatic birds or mammals. It is his personal mission to start over with a new civilisation underwater via complete anarchy against the \"surface world\". After contracting two scientists to create the technology to track nuclear submarines, Stromberg uses this technology to capture a Soviet nuclear submarine and a British submarine. By tracking the subs, Stromberg's specially adapted tanker, Liparus, sneaks up on the subs, forces them to the surface through methods using some kind of high frequencies to disrupt the sub's electrical system and captures them inside the tanker. His plan calls for the firing of nuclear missiles from these subs at Moscow and New York City, thus framing each other's government and starting a nuclear war, which would wipe out every last human being on Earth. Among Stromberg's many minions were an assistant who betrayed him by trying to sell the plans for the submarine tracking system, and a professor and a doctor who were to help him operate the tracking system after it was complete. He killed his assistant by feeding her to a shark, and killed the professor and the doctor, having outlived their usefulness, by blowing up their helicopter. (In a comic relief after cancelling the payment to the professor and doctor he has his secretary inform the two men's families that they have met with an accident and are \"buried at sea\".)  This scheme is similar to that of an earlier Bond film, You Only Live Twice, which posited stealing space capsules to start a war between the Soviets and the Americans. The idea of commandeering two nuclear missiles and attempting to fire them at two major cities likewise recalls the plot of Thunderball. The scheme in which the villain wishes to destroy mankind to create a new race or new civilisation was also used in Moonraker, the next film after The Spy Who Loved Me. In Moonraker, the villain Hugo Drax has an obsession with restarting human civilisation in outer space, although Drax's plans were to eventually return to Earth, unlike Stromberg. The film Moonraker was also written by Christopher Wood. Both Stromberg and Drax have hired Jaws as a henchman.  Prevention Stromberg's scheme is foiled after Bond is taken aboard the Liparus as a prisoner from a recently captured American submarine. With Bond's help, the crews from the submarines escape and take over the tanker. With the tanker under their control, Bond is able to order the stolen submarines, which were crewed by Stromberg's men, to fire their nuclear warheads at each other. Prior to this, however, Stromberg had abducted Bond's partner, the Russian agent Anya Amasova, and escaped to his city-ship, Atlantis.  Bond pursues Stromberg, and after two failed attempts by Stromberg to kill him (including the use of an explosive harpoon which ran the length of a dinner table), Bond exercises his licence to kill by shooting Stromberg multiple times in the groin and chest. Atlantis is later torpedoed and sunk, giving Stromberg a burial at sea.

He served in the United States Army, stationed at the United States Military Academy at West Point, in the Department of Social Sciences.  Before turning to cartooning, Mack was the art director for Book Week at the New York Herald Tribune, and art director of the Book and Education Department and The New York Times Sunday Magazine at The New York Times.  Real Life Funnies was notable for its semi-documentary feel: all dialog was culled from Mack's observations, and reported as \"100% Guaranteed Overheard\". He said of it: \"This job gave me an excuse to accost people, to be pushy and aggressive. ... I learned to take notes on my shirt cuffs and walk backward in crowds. But most of all I learned to listen to what ordinary people have to say.\"  With his late partner Janet Bode, he cowrote several young adult nonfiction books, including Heartbreak and Roses, Hard Time, and For Better, For Worse. He has also created children's picture books, including Where's My Cheese and 10 Bears in My Bed. In 1998, Mack wrote and illustrated The Story of the Jews: A 4,000 Year Adventure, a humorous cartoon look at the history of the Jews. In his 2004 book Janet & Me: An Illustrated Story of Love and Loss, he wrote about his eighteen-year relationship with Bode and her eventual death from cancer.

The cemetery was established in 1860 by the city's Jewish community on a plot of land donated by Edward Everett. The cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. The original parcel of land for the cemetery was 1.5 acres (0.61 ha). In 1928, a parcel of land 2.6 acres (1.1 ha) in size was added to the cemetery's holdings, and is known as the Fields of Spring. The expanded cemetery is now 4.6 acres (1.8 ha) in size. The cemetery was designed by Hammatt Billings, a prominent Boston landscape architect. The main gate is ornamented with a Star of David and an ammonite. The ammonite is a reference to the biblical story of the ammonites, in which the children of Israel are told to place a scroll of the Law inside a protective case. The scroll is meant to represent the body, and the case the grave. The Star of David serves as a reminder that the person buried within is Jewish. The cemetery is a traditional, non-denominational Jewish cemetery, and is open to people of all faiths for burial. It is the final resting place for many notable Bostonians, including Major General Benjamin Butler, a Union Army general during the Civil War who was known for his controversial policy of \"amputation resolutions\" that allowed him to execute or pardon those who had engaged in certain crimes against civilians; Samuel August, a German-born Bostonian who founded August Clocks, one of the city's oldest businesses; Mary Antin, a Russian-born Jewish American writer best known for her book The Promised Land; and WilliamZO'Brien, a businessman and politician who served as the first Irish-American mayor of Boston. The cemetery is a contributor to the local community. Since the early 20th century, the cemetery has been a member of the Boston Business Alliance, and is a founding member of the Jamaica Plain Neighborhood Council. In addition, the cemetery has been a member of the City of Boston's Department of Public Works since the 1930s, and has contributed to the beautification of the neighborhood by planting trees along the perimeter of the cemetery.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 25052151}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Sunday school answer\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "\"Sunday school answer\" is a pejorative used within Evangelical Christianity to refer to an answer as being the kind of answer one might give to a child. The phrase derives its name from the concept that certain answers are likely to be an appropriate answer to a question asked in a Sunday school even if one has not heard the question. These answers include Jesus, sin, and the cross.  For example, if a Sunday school teacher were to ask the question, \"Now class, what is brown and furry and collects nuts for the winter?\", a student might respond, \"It sure sounds like a squirrel, but... is it Jesus?\" The term \"Sunday school answer\" is commonly used to criticize someone for attempting to answer a complex question with an answer that is simplistic, that has not been thought out well, or that is not connected with reality. It can also be used to criticize someone for boastfully trying to call attention to their knowledge of the Bible.   According to James W. Fowler's stages of faith development, people who are in Stage 4, the \"Individuative-Reflective\" stage, find such answers an impediment to addressing new questions that they wish to ask.  In her book Love Letters to Miscarried Moms, Samantha Evans argues that answers dismissed as Sunday school answers \"for being obvious, corny and surface-level answers... are most often the right answers\".  Some Christian educators raise the concern that kids are getting too much Sunday School, eventually leading to spiritual burnout.  National Basketball Association player Jeremy Lin said in a 2013 interview that, although he \"knew the Sunday school answers\" while he was growing up, it wasn't until he became a high school freshman and joined a youth group where he experienced \"radical love\" that he felt like he wanted to commit to Christianity.  In Mormonism \"Sunday school answer\" is also used in the culture of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) to refer to trite answers that one might provide to a question posed during the church's Sunday School classes. Such answers include \"reading the scriptures, praying daily, serving ... family and others, and attending the temple and ... Sunday meetings\". Church members sometimes argue that if the Sunday School answers are truly implemented in one's life, they are the answers to life's challenges.

A Sunday school answer is typically given in response to a question that is straightforward and expects a simple answer. Answering a question with a Sunday school answer can be a way of avoiding the real issue. Sunday school answers can range from a simple \"yes\" or \"no\" to a more complex restatement of the question. In some cases, a Sunday school answer can be used to avoid giving a real answer to a question. For example, if someone asks \"Why did you do that?\" and the answer is \"Because I wanted to,\" it could be a Sunday school answer. This answer does not address the real issue and does not give a real reason for doing something. In other cases, a Sunday school answer can be used to give a simple, straightforward answer to a question that expects a more complex answer. For example, if someone asks \"What is the capital of France?\" and the answer is \"Paris,\" it could be a Sunday school answer. This answer is simple and straightforward, and it provides the information that is being asked for. Sunday school answers can be used in a variety of situations, from casual conversations to formal interviews. In some cases, giving a Sunday school answer can be a way of avoiding a more complex or uncomfortable conversation.

Background and education Finlay was born at Cherry Bank in Newhaven, Edinburgh, the son of William Finlay, a physician, and Ann, daughter of Robert Bannatyne. He was educated at the Edinburgh Academy and Edinburgh University, graduating in medicine in 1864.  Legal and political career After entering Middle Temple as a student in 1865, Finlay was called to the bar two years later and built up a successful practice, becoming a Queen's Counsel in 1882. Three years later he was elected Liberal Member of Parliament for the Inverness Burghs, but broke with William Ewart Gladstone over Irish Home Rule and joined the Liberal Unionists in 1886. He lost his seat in 1892 but regained it three years later, the same year he was appointed Solicitor General and knighted.  In 1900, Finlay became Attorney General for England and Wales and also became President of the Edinburgh Sir Walter Scott Club, and gave the Toast to Sir Walter at the club's annual dinner. In November 1902 he was elected Lord Rector of Edinburgh University for three years, and the same month he was elected Treasurer of the Middle Temple for the ensuing year. For his services in representing the British Empire in a number of international legal arbitrations he was appointed GCMG in 1904, and the following year became a Privy Counsellor. However, in the 1906 general election he again lost his seat, and it was four years before he returned to Parliament as member for Edinburgh and St Andrews Universities. One of his last official acts as Attorney General was to appoint his son, William Finlay, as the junior counsel to the Board of Inland Revenue, an appointment which provoked much negative comment.  Judicial career  On 19 December 1916, Finlay became Lord Chancellor in Lloyd George's coalition government, being at the same time created Baron Finlay, of Nairn in the County of Nairn. It is generally thought that Finlay was a temporary appointment: Lloyd George excluded him from the War Cabinet and insisted that he forego the \u00a35,000 pension given to retired lord chancellors. He sat on the Woolsack for three years, and in 1919, on his retirement, was created Viscount Finlay, of Nairn in the County of Nairn on 27 March.  The following year he was appointed a British member of the Court of Arbitration at The Hague, and in 1921 was elected a Judge of the Permanent Court of International Justice established by the League of Nations. As a judge of the Permanent Court, he participated in the celebrated  Lotus case in  1927, where the Court, by a bare majority.  laid down the \"Lotus principle\" that States may exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction i.e. they may apply their national laws beyond their own borders, in any case where this is not explicitly prohibited. Finlay himself dissented from the majority decision.  Finlay received the freedom of the Royal burgh of Nairn on 1 October 1902.  Family Lord Finlay married Mary, daughter of Cosmo Innes, in 1874. She died in June 1911. Lord Finlay died in March 1929, aged 86, at his home in Kensington, London, and was buried at Nairn. He was succeeded in his titles by his son, William, later a Lord Justice of Appeal.

He was the first Scottish advocate to become a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary and the first to hold the office of Lord Chancellor of Great Britain and Ireland. Finlay was born in Edinburgh, the son of the physician and scientific writer John Finlay (1799\u20131869) and his wife, Elizabeth (1807\u20131897), daughter of Robert Smith, a prosperous Edinburgh businessman. He was educated at Edinburgh Academy, Edinburgh High School, and University of Edinburgh, where he won the Vans Agnew Medal and the Senior Medal in forensic medicine. He then went to Balliol College, Oxford, where he obtained a first class degree in classics and a second class degree in law. He was called to the bar in 1876 and built up a large practice in Scotland, specialising in medical law. In 1901 he was made a Queen's Counsel and in 1908 a silk. He was an outstanding lawyer and his services were in great demand. He was asked by the Home Office to draft the bill which became the Sea Fisheries (Conservation of Stocks) Act 1902, and he advised the government on the Workmen's Compensation Act 1906 and the National Insurance Act 1911. He was a member of the Royal Commission on the Poor Law of 1909\u20131910, and of the Royal Commission on the Private Manufacture of Drugs and poisonous Chemicals, 1912\u20131915. In 1913 he became a member of the Committee on the Unauthorised Practice of Medicine, and in 1916 he was appointed a member of the Advisory Committee on Child Labour. He was also a member of the International Commission of Lawyers appointed to inquire into the methods of settlement of international disputes. In 1908 he became a member of the Faculty of Advocates' Committee on the Law of Medicine and in 1912 he was appointed Dean of the Faculty of Advocates. In 1919 he was made a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary and was sworn in as a member of the Privy Council. Two years later, in 1921, he was appointed Lord Chancellor, in which office he served until his death. In 1922 he was made a life peer as Baron Finlay, of Nairn in the County of Nairn, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, and in 1927 he was further honoured when he was made a Viscount, entitling him to sit in the House of Lords as Lord Finlay. Lord Finlay was an excellent public speaker and a sound lawyer, but his appointment as Lord Chancellor was politically motivated, and he was not regarded by his contemporaries as a great lawyer. His tenure of the office of Lord Chancellor was not marked by any important legislation, and he is best remembered for his work in connection with the development of the law relating to medical negligence. In 1925, in the case of Donoghue v. Stevenson, he gave the first decision in a test case which was to become a landmark in the development of the law of negligence. He also gave the decision in the case of Allen v Sir Alfred McAlpine & Sons Ltd [1927] AC 696, in which it was held that the employer of a workman is not liable for an injury sustained by the workman due to the negligence of a fellow workman. Lord Finlay was a member of the Roxburghe Club and the Selborne Society. He was also a member of the council of the Scottish History Society and a vice-president of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He was a keen golfer and a member of the St. Andrews Golf Club and of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews. Lord Finlay married twice, first in 1880 to Jessie, daughter of David Smith of Aberdeen, by whom he had one son and one daughter, and, after her death in 1917, to Annie, daughter of Thomas Millie of Aberdeen, by whom he had one son and one daughter. He died in London on 9 February 1929, aged 77, and was succeeded in his titles by his elder son from his first marriage, John, who became a distinguished lawyer and judge in his own right. His second son, Robert, became a general in the Royal Air Force. His daughter from his first marriage, Janet, married the statistician and golfer Sir Henry Cotton. A collection of his speeches and essays was published in 1930, and a biography, by Sir WilliamWedgwood Benn, in 1931.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 893071}

The team plays its home matches at Cownie Sports Complex on the south side of Des Moines, Iowa and is coached by Scotsman Gareth Smith.  History The Drake program began in 1986. Under coach Bob Wood, the Bulldogs would compile a 16\u201316 record over two seasons as an independent before joining the Big Central Soccer Conference for the 1988 season. After a three-year run in the BCSC saw Drake post a collective 29\u201325\u20134 record (8\u20137\u20133 in conference), the Bulldogs would join their traditional sporting conference, the Missouri Valley Conference, for the 1991 season.  Upon joining the MVC, the Bulldogs went 6\u201310\u20130 (1\u20132\u20130) in 1991 season and 6\u201312\u20132 (2\u20132\u20131) in 1992. The Bulldogs would bounce back to post three consecutive winning seasons for the first time in school history from 1993 to 1995 (including a record-best 4\u20132\u20130 mark in 1994 MVC play). During his final seasons, Wood's teams totaled a combined 14\u201321\u20131 record in 1996\u20131997.  For the 1998 season, Drake hired Swiss-born Canadian, 32-year-old Evansville assistant Sean Holmes. In 1998, the Bulldogs earned a 6\u201311\u20131 mark. In 1999, Drake went 4\u201313\u20131 (1\u20135\u20131).  For the 2003 season, the Bulldogs moved from the larger Drake Stadium into the more-intimate off-campus Cownie Sports Complex, and Holmes began to turn the program around, guiding the Bulldogs to a 4th-place finish in the conference, good enough to host a quarterfinal match in the conference tournament. The 2003 squad achieved the first top 25 ranking in the program's history. The 2004 squad would begin the season ranked for the first time in school history, and the 2005 season saw victories over three ranked opponents, including a win over then-sixteenth-ranked Creighton for the first time in school history.  In 2008, Holmes' Drake squad had a breakout season. Drake would win a school-record 13 matches (against 5 losses and 1 draw) and earned an NCAA Tournament berth for the first time. Drawn into the Queens, New York region of the bracket, the Bulldogs would battle hard at Saint Louis before falling on a goal just 4.1\u00a0seconds away from penalty kicks.  The 2009 season saw Holmes' team take the program to new heights. Hosting the Missouri Valley Conference tournament after finishing second in the regular season, the Bulldogs edged third-seeded Creighton, 2\u20131, before defeating fourth-seeded Evansville, 2\u20131, to win the school's first-ever conference tournament title and clinching their second consecutive College Cup appearance. In the tournament, the Bulldogs would earn their first-ever NCAA victory with a 2\u20131 win over Western Illinois and then stunned fourth-seeded Ohio State 1\u20130 to advance to the Sweet 16 In the Sweet 16, after falling behind 2\u20130, the Bulldogs rallied to a stunning 6\u20134 win at Boston College before falling in a 2\u20131 heartbreaker to No. 5 North Carolina in the national quarterfinals.  Hours before the start of the 2015 season, Drake announced that assistant Gareth Smith would replace 17-year head coach Holmes to become interim head coach. Smith was promoted to head coach after Drake finished 3rd in the MVC regular season. The 3rd seeded Bulldogs then won three consecutive matches in the conference tournament to earn the conference's automatic bid to the 2015 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Championship. In the tournament, the Bulldogs knocked of No. 17 Kentucky 2\u20131 in the first round before falling to former MVC member Creighton in the second round.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Track and field\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Track and field is a sport that includes athletic contests based on running, jumping, and throwing skills. The name is derived from where the sport takes place, a running track and a grass field for the throwing and some of the jumping events. Track and field is categorized under the umbrella sport of athletics, which also includes road running, cross country running, and racewalking.  The foot racing events, which include sprints, middle- and long-distance events, racewalking, and hurdling, are won by the athlete who completes it in the least time. The jumping and throwing events are won by those who achieve the greatest distance or height. Regular jumping events include long jump, triple jump, high jump, and pole vault, while the most common throwing events are shot put, javelin, discus, and hammer. There are also \"combined events\" or \"multi events\", such as the pentathlon consisting of five events, heptathlon consisting of seven events, and decathlon consisting of ten events. In these, athletes participate in a combination of track and field events. Most track and field events are individual sports with a single victor; the most prominent team events are relay races, which typically feature teams of four. Events are almost exclusively divided by gender, although both the men's and women's competitions are usually held at the same venue. Recently, \u201cmixed\u201d relay events have been introduced into meets, whereby two men and two women make up the four-person team. If a race has too many people to run all at once, preliminary heats will be run to narrow down the field of participants.  Track and field is one of the oldest sports. In ancient times, it was an event held in conjunction with festivals and sports meets such as the Ancient Olympic Games in Greece. In modern times, the two most prestigious international track and field competitions are the athletics competition at the Olympic Games and the World Athletics Championships. World Athletics, formerly known as the International Association of Athletics Federations, is the international governing body for the sport of athletics.  Records are kept of the best performances in specific events, at world, continental, and national levels, right down to a personal level. However, if athletes are deemed to have violated the event's rules or regulations, they are disqualified from the competition and their marks are erased.  In the United States, the term track and field may refer to other athletics events, such as cross country, the marathon, and road running, rather than strictly track-based events.  History  The sport of track and field has its roots in human prehistory. Track and field style events are among the oldest of all sporting competitions, as running, jumping and throwing are natural and universal forms of human physical expression. The first recorded examples of organized track and field events at a sports festival are the Ancient Olympic Games. At the first Games in 776 BC in Olympia, Greece, only one event was contested: the stadion footrace. The scope of the Games expanded in later years to include further running competitions, but the introduction of the Ancient Olympic pentathlon marked a step towards track and field as it is recognized today\u2014it comprised a five-event competition of the long jump, javelin throw, discus throw, stadion footrace, and wrestling.  Track and field events were also present at the Panhellenic Games in Greece around this period, and they spread to Rome in Italy around 200 BC. After the period of Classical antiquity (in which the sport was largely Greco-Roman influenced) new track and field events began developing in parts of Northern Europe in the Middle Ages. The stone put and weight throw competitions popular among Celtic societies in Ireland and Scotland were precursors to the modern shot put and hammer throw events. One of the last track and field events to develop was the pole vault, which stemmed from competitions such as the Fierljeppen contests in the Northern European Lowlands in the 18th century.  Discrete modern track and field competitions, separate from general sporting festivals, were first recorded in the 19th century. These were typically organised by educational institutions, military organisations and sports clubs as competitions between rival establishments. Competitions in the English public schools were conceived as human equivalents of horse racing, fox hunting and hare coursing, influenced by a Classics-rich curriculum. The Royal Shrewsbury School Hunt is the oldest running club in the world, with written records going back to 1831 and evidence that it was established by 1819. The school organised Paper Chase races in which runners followed a trail of paper shreds left by two \"foxes\"; even today RSSH runners are called \"hounds\" and a race victory is a \"kill\". The first definite record of Shrewsbury's (cross-country) Annual Steeplechase is in 1834, making it the oldest running race of the modern era. The school also lays claim to the oldest track and field meeting still in existence, originating in the Second Spring Meeting first documented in 1840. This featured a series of throwing and jumping events with mock horse races including the Derby Stakes, the Hurdle Race and the Trial Stakes. Runners were entered by \"owners\" and named as though they were horses.  away and a decade later, the first Wenlock Olympian Games were held at Much Wenlock racecourse. Events at the 1851 Wenlock Games included a \"half-mile foot race\" (805\u00a0m) and a \"leaping in distance\" competition.  In 1865, Dr William Penny Brookes of Wenlock helped set up the National Olympian Association, which held their first Olympian Games in 1866 at The Crystal Palace in London. This national event was a great success, attracting a crowd of over ten thousand people.  In response, that same year the Amateur Athletic Club was formed and held a championship for \"gentlemen amateurs\" in an attempt to reclaim the sport for the educated elite. Ultimately the \"allcomers\" ethos of the NOA won through and the AAC was reconstituted as the Amateur Athletic Association in 1880, the first national body for the sport of athletics. The AAA Championships, the de facto British national championships despite being for England only, have been held annually since 3 July 1880 with breaks only during two world wars and 2006\u20132008. The AAA was effectively a global governing body in the early years of the sport, codifying its rules for the first time.  Meanwhile, the United States began holding an annual national competition\u2014the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships\u2014first held in 1876 by the New York Athletic Club. The establishment of general sports governing bodies for the United States (the Amateur Athletic Union in 1888) and France (the Union des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s fran\u00e7aises de sports athl\u00e9tiques in 1889) put the sport on a formal footing and meant that international competitions became possible.  The establishment of the modern Olympic Games at the end of the 19th century marked a new high for track and field. The Olympic athletics programme, comprising track and field events plus a marathon race, contained many of the foremost sporting competitions of the 1896 Summer Olympics. The Olympics also consolidated the use of metric measurements in international track and field events, both for race distances and for measuring jumps and throws. The Olympic athletics programme greatly expanded over the next decades, and track and field contests remained among the Games' most prominent. The Olympics was the elite competition for track and field, and only amateur sportsmen could compete. Track and field continued to be a largely amateur sport, as this rule was strictly enforced: Jim Thorpe was stripped of his track and field medals from the 1912 Olympics after it was revealed that he had taken expense money for playing baseball, violating Olympic amateurism rules, before the 1912 Games. His medals were reinstated 29 years after his death.  That same year, the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) was established, becoming the international governing body for track and field, and it enshrined amateurism as one of its founding principles for the sport. The National Collegiate Athletic Association held their first Men's Outdoor Track and Field Championship in 1921, making it one of the most prestigious competitions for students, and this was soon followed by the introduction of track and field at the inaugural World Student Games in 1923. The first continental track and field competition was the 1919 South American Championships, which was followed by the European Athletics Championships in 1934.  Up until the early 1920s, track and field had been almost exclusively a male-only pursuit. Alice Milliat argued for the inclusion of women at the Olympics, but the International Olympic Committee refused. She founded the International Women's Sports Federation in 1921 and, alongside a growing women's sports movement in Europe and North America, the group initiated of the Women's Olympiad (held annually from 1921 to 1923). Working in conjunction with the English Women's Amateur Athletic Association (WAAA), the Women's World Games was held four times between 1922 and 1934, as well as a Women's International and British Games in London in 1924. These events ultimately led to the introduction of five track and field events for women in the athletics at the 1928 Summer Olympics. In China, women's track and field events were being held in the 1920s, but were subject to criticism and disrespect from audiences. National women's events were established in this period, with 1923 seeing the First British Track & Field championships for women and the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) sponsoring the First American Track & Field championships for women. Also in 1923, physical education advocate Zhang Ruizhen called for greater equality and participation of women in Chinese track and field. The rise of Kinue Hitomi and her 1928 Olympic medal for Japan signified the growth of women's track and field in East Asia. More women's events were gradually introduced as years progressed (although it was only towards the end of the century that the men's and women's programmes approached parity of events). Marking an increasingly inclusive approach to the sport, major track and field competitions for disabled athletes were first introduced at the 1960 Summer Paralympics.  With the rise of numerous regional championships, as well as the growth in Olympic-style multi-sport events (such as the Commonwealth Games and the Pan-American Games), competitions between international track and field athletes became widespread. From the 1960s onwards, the sport gained more exposure and commercial appeal through television coverage and the increasing wealth of nations. After over half a century of amateurism, the amateur status of the sport began to be displaced by growing professionalism in the late 1970s. As a result, the Amateur Athletic Union was dissolved in the United States and it was replaced with a non-amateur body solely focused on the sport of athletics: The Athletics Congress (later USA Track and Field). The IAAF abandoned amateurism in 1982 and later removed all references to it from its name by rebranding itself as the International Association of Athletics Federations. While Western countries were limited to amateurs until the early 1980s, Soviet Bloc countries always fielded state-funded athletes who trained full-time, putting American and Western European athletes at a significant disadvantage. 1983 saw the establishment of the IAAF World Championships in Athletics\u2014the first-ever global competition just for athletics\u2014which, with the Olympics, became one of track and field's most prestigious competitions.  The profile of the sport reached a new high in the 1980s, with a number of athletes becoming household names (such as Carl Lewis, Sergey Bubka, Sebastian Coe, Zola Budd and Florence Griffith Joyner). Many world records were broken in this period, and the added political element between competitors of the United States, East Germany, and the Soviet Union, in reaction to the Cold War, only served to stoke the sport's popularity. The increase in the commercial capacity of track and field was also met with developments in the application of sports science, and there were many changes to coaching methods, athlete's diet regimes, training facilities, and sports equipment. This was also accompanied by an increase in the use of performance-enhancing drugs. State-sponsored doping in 1970s and 1980s East Germany, China, the Soviet Union, and early 21st century Russia, as well as prominent individual cases such as those of Olympic gold medallists Ben Johnson and Marion Jones, damaged the public image and marketability of the sport.  From the 1990s onwards, track and field became increasingly more professional and international, as the IAAF gained over two hundred member nations. The IAAF World Championships in Athletics became a fully professional competition with the introduction of prize money in 1997, and in 1998 the IAAF Golden League\u2014an annual series of major track and field meetings in Europe\u2014provided a higher level of economic incentive in the form of a US$1 million jackpot. In 2010, the series was replaced by the more lucrative IAAF Diamond League, a fourteen-meeting series held in Europe, Asia, North America, and the Middle East\u2014the first-ever worldwide annual series of track and field meetings.  Events  Track and field events are divided into three broad categories: track events, field events, and combined events. The majority of athletes tend to specialize in just one event (or event type) with the aim of perfecting their performances, although the aim of combined events athletes is to become proficient in a number of disciplines. Track events involve running on a track over specified distances, and\u2014in the case of the hurdling and steeplechase events\u2014obstacles may be placed on the track. There are also relay races in which teams of athletes run and pass on a baton to their team members at the end of a certain distance.  There are two types of field events: jumps and throws. In jumping competitions, athletes are judged on either the length or height of their jumps. The performances of jumping events for distance are measured from a board or marker, and any athlete overstepping this mark is judged to have fouled. In the jumps for height, an athlete must clear their body over a crossbar without knocking the bar off the supporting standards. The majority of jumping events are unaided, although athletes propel themselves vertically with purpose-built sticks in the pole vault.  The throwing events involve hurling an implement (such as a heavyweight, javelin, or discus) from a set point, with athletes being judged on the distance that the object is thrown. Combined events involve the same group of athletes contesting a number of different track and field events. Points are given for their performance in each event and the athlete and/or team with the greatest points total at the end of all events is the winner.  Track  Sprints  Races over short distances, or sprints, are among the oldest running competitions. The first 13 editions of the Ancient Olympic Games featured only one event, the stadion race, which was a race from one end of the stadium to the other. Sprinting events are focused on athletes reaching and sustaining their quickest possible running speed. Three sprinting events are currently held at the Olympics and outdoor World Championships: the 100 metres, 200 metres, and 400 metres. These events have their roots in races of imperial measurements that later changed to metric: the 100\u00a0m evolved from the 100-yard dash, the 200\u00a0m distances came from the furlong (or 1/8 of a mile), and the 400\u00a0m was the successor to the 440 yard dash or quarter-mile race.  At the professional level, sprinters begin the race by assuming a crouching position in the starting blocks before leaning forward and gradually moving into an upright position as the race progresses and momentum is gained. Athletes remain in the same lane on the running track throughout all sprinting events, with the sole exception of the 400\u00a0m indoors. Races up to 100\u00a0m are largely focused upon acceleration to an athlete's maximum speed. All sprints beyond this distance increasingly incorporate an element of endurance. Human physiology dictates that a runner's near-top speed cannot be maintained for more than thirty seconds or so because lactic acid builds up once leg muscles begin to suffer oxygen deprivation.  Top speed can only be maintained for up to 20\u00a0metres.  The 60 metres is a common indoor event and indoor world championship event. Less-common events include the 50 metres, 55 metres, 300 metres, and 500 metres, which are run in some high school and collegiate competitions in the United States. The 150 metres, though rarely competed, has a star-studded history: Pietro Mennea set a world best in 1983, Olympic champions Michael Johnson and Donovan Bailey went head-to-head over the distance in 1997, and Usain Bolt improved Mennea's record in 2009.  Middle distance  The most common middle-distance track events are the 800 metres, 1500 metres and mile run, although the 3000 metres may also be classified as a middle-distance event. The 880 yard run, or half mile, was the forebear of the 800\u00a0m distance and it has its roots in competitions in the United Kingdom in the 1830s. The 1500\u00a0m came about as a result of running three laps of a 500\u00a0m track, which was commonplace in continental Europe in the 20th century.  Runners start the race from a standing position along a curved starting line and after hearing the starting pistol they head towards the innermost track to follow the quickest route to the finish. In 800\u00a0m races athletes begin at a staggered starting point before the turn in the track and they must remain in their lanes for the first 100\u00a0m of the race. This rule was introduced to reduce the amount of physical jostling between runners in the early stages of the race. Physiologically, these middle-distance events demand that athletes have good aerobic and anaerobic energy producing systems, and also that they have strong speed endurance.  The 1500\u00a0m and mile run events have historically been some of the most prestigious track and field events. Swedish rivals Gunder H\u00e4gg and Arne Andersson broke each other's 1500\u00a0m and mile world records on a number of occasions in the 1940s. The prominence of the distances were maintained by Roger Bannister, who (in 1954) was the first to run the long-elusive four-minute mile, and Jim Ryun's exploits served to popularise interval training. Races between British rivals Sebastian Coe, Steve Ovett and Steve Cram characterised middle-distance running in the 1980s. From the 1990s onwards, North Africans such as Noureddine Morceli of Algeria and Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco came to dominate the 1500 and mile events.  Beyond the short distances of sprinting events, factors such as an athlete's reactions and top speed becomes less important, while qualities such as pace, race tactics and endurance become more so.  Long-distance  There are three common long-distance running events in track and field competitions: 3000 metres, 5000 metres and 10,000 metres. The latter two races are both Olympic and World Championship events outdoors, while the 3000\u00a0m is held at the IAAF World Indoor Championships. The 5000\u00a0m and 10,000\u00a0m events have their historical roots in the 3-mile and 6-mile races. The 3000\u00a0m was historically used as a women's long-distance event, entering the World Championship programme in 1983 and Olympic programme in 1984, but this was abandoned in favour of a women's 5000\u00a0m event in 1995.  Marathons, while long-distance races, are typically run on street courses, and often are run separately from other track and field events.  In terms of competition rules and physical demands, long-distance track races have much in common with middle-distance races, except that pacing, stamina, and race tactics become much greater factors in performances. However, a number of athletes have achieved success in both middle- and long-distance events, including Sa\u00efd Aouita who set world records from 1500\u00a0m to 5000\u00a0m. The use of pace-setters in long-distance events is very common at the elite level, although they are not present at championship level competitions as all qualified competitors want to win.  The long-distance track events gained popularity in the 1920s by the achievements of the \"Flying Finns\", such as multiple Olympic champion Paavo Nurmi. The successes of Emil Z\u00e1topek in the 1950s promoted intense interval training methods, but Ron Clarke's world record-breaking feats established the importance of natural training and even-paced running. The 1990s saw the rise of North and East African runners in long-distance events. Kenyan and Ethiopian athletes, in particular, have since remained dominant in these events.  Relay races  Relay races are the only track and field event in which a team of runners directly compete against other teams. Typically, a team is made up of four runners of the same sex. Each runner completes their specified distance (referred to as a leg) before handing over a baton to a teammate, who then begins their leg upon receiving the baton. There is usually a designated area where athletes must exchange the baton. Teams may be disqualified if they fail to complete the change within the area, or if the baton is dropped during the race. A team may also be disqualified if its runners are deemed to have wilfully impeded other competitors.  Relay races emerged in the United States in the 1880s as a variation on charity races between firemen, who would hand a red pennant on to teammates every 300\u00a0yards. There are two very common relay events: the 4\u00d7100 metres relay and the 4\u00d7400 metres relay. Both events entered the Olympic programme at the 1912 Summer Games after a one-off men's medley relay featured in 1908 Olympics. The 4 \u00d7 100 m event is run strictly within the same lane on the track, meaning that the team collectively runs one complete circuit of the track. Teams in a 4 \u00d7 400 m event remain in their own lane until the runner of the second leg passes the first bend, at which point runners can leave their lanes and head towards the inner-most part of the circuit. For the second and third baton change overs, teammates must align themselves in respect of their team position \u2013 leading teams take the inner lanes while teammates of the slower teams must await the baton on outer lanes.  The Shuttle Hurdle Relay per Hurdling web page: In a shuttle hurdle relay, each of four hurdlers on a team runs the opposite direction from the preceding runner. No batons are used for this particular relay.  The IAAF keeps world records for five different types of track relays. As with 4\u00d7100\u00a0m and 4\u00d7400\u00a0m events, all races comprise teams of four athletes running the same distances, with the less commonly contested distances being the 4\u00d7200\u00a0m, 4\u00d7800\u00a0m and 4\u00d71500\u00a0m relays. Other events include the distance medley relay (comprising legs of 1200\u00a0m, 400\u00a0m, 800\u00a0m, and 1600\u00a0m), which is frequently held in the United States, and a sprint relay, known as the Swedish medley relay, which is popular in Scandinavia and was held at the IAAF World Youth Championships in Athletics programme. Relay events have significant participation in the United States, where a number of large meetings (or relay carnivals) are focused almost exclusively on relay events.  Hurdling  Races with hurdles as obstacles were first popularised in the 19th century in England. The first known event, held in 1830, was a variation of the 100-yard dash that included heavy wooden barriers as obstacles. A competition between the Oxford and Cambridge Athletic Clubs in 1864 refined this, holding a 120-yard race (110\u00a0m) with ten hurdles of 3-foot and 6\u00a0inches (1.06\u00a0m) in height (each placed 10 yards (9\u00a0m) apart), with the first and final hurdles 15 yards from the start and finish, respectively. French organisers adapted the race into metric (adding 28\u00a0cm) and the basics of this race, the men's 110 metres hurdles, has remained largely unchanged. The origin of the 400 metres hurdles also lies in Oxford, where (around 1860) a competition was held over 440\u00a0yards and twelve 1.06\u00a0m high wooden barriers were placed along the course. The modern regulations stem from the 1900 Summer Olympics: the distance was fixed to 400\u00a0m while ten 3-foot (91.44\u00a0cm) hurdles were placed 35\u00a0m apart on the track, with the first and final hurdles being 45\u00a0m and 40\u00a0m away from the start and finish, respectively. Women's hurdles are slightly lower at 84\u00a0cm (2\u00a0ft 9\u00a0in) for the 100\u00a0m event and 76\u00a0cm (2\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in) for the 400\u00a0m event.  By far the most common events are the 100 metres hurdles for women, 110\u00a0m hurdles for men and 400\u00a0m hurdles for both sexes. The men's 110\u00a0m has been featured at every modern Summer Olympics while the men's 400\u00a0m was introduced in the second edition of the Games. Women's initially competed in the 80 metres hurdles event, which entered the Olympic programme in 1932. This was extended to the 100\u00a0m hurdles at the 1972 Olympics, but it was not until 1984 that a women's 400\u00a0m hurdles event took place at the Olympics (having been introduced at the 1983 World Championships in Athletics the previous year).  Other distances and heights of hurdles, such as the 200 metres hurdles and low hurdles, were once common but are now held infrequently.  The 300 metres hurdles is run in some levels of American competition.  Outside of the hurdles events, the steeplechase race is the other track and field event with obstacles. Just as the hurdling events, the steeplechase finds its origin in student competition in Oxford, England. However, this event was born as a human variation on the original steeplechase competition found in horse racing. A steeplechase event was held on a track for the 1879 English championships and the 1900 Summer Olympics featured men's 2500\u00a0m and 4000\u00a0m steeplechase races. The event was held over various distances until the 1920 Summer Olympics marked the rise of the 3000 metres steeplechase as the standard event. The IAAF set the standards of the event in 1954, and the event is held on a 400\u00a0m circuit that includes a water jump on each lap. Despite the long history of men's steeplechase in track and field, the women's steeplechase only gained World Championship status in 2005, with its first Olympic appearance in 2008.  Field  Jumping  Long jump  The long jump is one of the oldest track and field events, having its roots as one of the events within the ancient Greek pentathlon contest. The athletes would take a short run up and jump into an area of dug up earth, with the winner being the one who jumped farthest. Small weights (Halteres) were held in each hand during the jump then swung back and dropped near the end to gain extra momentum and distance. The modern long jump, standardised in England and the United States around 1860, bears resemblance to the ancient event although no weights are used. Athletes sprint along a length of track that leads to a jumping board and a sandpit. The athletes must jump before a marked line and their achieved distance is measured from the nearest point of sand disturbed by the athlete's body.  The athletics competition at the first Olympics featured a men's long jump competition and a women's competition was introduced at the 1948 Summer Olympics. Professional long jumpers typically have strong acceleration and sprinting abilities. However, athletes must also have a consistent stride to allow them to take off near the board while still maintaining their maximum speed. In addition to the traditional long jump, a standing long jump contest exists which requires that athletes leap from a static position without a run-up. A men's version of this event featured on the Olympic programme from 1900 to 1912.  Triple jump  Similar to the long jump, the triple jump takes place on a track heading towards a sandpit. Originally, athletes would hop on the same leg twice before jumping into the pit, but this was changed to the current \"hop, step and jump\" pattern from 1900 onwards. There is some dispute over whether the triple jump was contested in ancient Greece: while some historians claim that a contest of three jumps occurred at Ancient Games, others such as Stephen G. Miller believe this is incorrect, suggesting that the belief stems from a mythologised account of Phayllus of Croton having jumped 55 ancient feet (around 16.3\u00a0m). The Book of Leinster, a 12th-century Irish manuscript, records the existence of geal-ruith (triple jump) contests at the Tailteann Games.  The men's triple jump competition has been ever-present at the modern Olympics, but it was not until 1993 that a women's version gained World Championship status and went on to have its first Olympic appearance three years later. The men's standing triple jump event featured at the Olympics in 1900 and 1904, but such competitions have since become very uncommon, although it is still used as a non-competitive exercise drill. The Current world record for the Men's triple jump is 18.29 meter (60\u00a0ft 0in) held by Jonathan Edwards. The current women's world record is 15.67 meters (51\u00a0ft 4 3/4in) held by Yulimar Rojas.  High jump  The first recorded instances of high jumping competitions were in Scotland in the 19th century. Further competitions were organised in 1840 in England and in 1865 the basic rules of the modern event were standardised there. Athletes have a short run up and then take off from one foot to jump over a horizontal bar and fall back onto a cushioned landing area. The men's high jump was included in the 1896 Olympics and a women's competition followed in 1928.  Jumping technique has played a significant part in the history of the event. High jumpers typically cleared the bar feet first in the late 19th century, using either the Scissors, Eastern cut-off or Western roll technique. The straddle technique became prominent in the mid-20th century, but Dick Fosbury overturned tradition by pioneering a backwards and head-first technique in the late 1960s \u2013 the Fosbury Flop \u2013 which won him the gold at the 1968 Olympics. This technique has become the overwhelming standard for the sport from the 1980s onwards. The standing high jump was contested at the Olympics from 1900 to 1912, but is now relatively uncommon outside of its use as an exercise drill.  Pole vault  In terms of sport, the use of poles for vaulting distances was recorded in Fierljeppen contests in the Frisian area of Europe, and vaulting for height was seen at gymnastics competitions in Germany in the 1770s. One of the earliest recorded pole vault competitions was in Cumbria, England in 1843. The basic rules and technique of the event originated in the United States. The rules required that athletes do not move their hands along the pole and athletes began clearing the bar with their feet first and twisting so that the stomach faces the bar. Bamboo poles were introduced in the 20th century and a metal box in the runway for planting the pole became standard. Landing mattresses were introduced in the mid-20th century to protect the athletes who were clearing increasingly greater heights.  The modern event sees athletes run down a strip of track, plant the pole in the metal box, and vault over the horizontal bar before letting go of the pole and falling backwards onto the landing mattress. While earlier versions used wooden, metal or bamboo, modern poles are generally made from artificial materials such as fibreglass or carbon fibre. The pole vault has been an Olympic event since 1896 for men, but it was over 100 years later that the first women's world championship competition was held at the 1997 IAAF World Indoor Championships. The first women's Olympic pole vaulting competition occurred in 2000.  Throwing Track and field contains some of the foremost kinds of throwing sports, and the four major disciplines are the only pure throwing events to feature at the Olympic Games.  Shot put  The genesis of the shot put can be traced to pre-historic competitions with rocks: in the Middle ages the stone put was known in Scotland and the steinstossen was recorded in Switzerland. In the 17th century, cannonball throwing competitions within the English military provided a precursor to the modern sport. The term \"shot\" originates from the use of round shot-style ammunition for the sport. The modern rules were first laid out in 1860 and required that competitors take legal throws within a square throwing area of seven feet (2.13\u00a0m) on each side. This was amended to a circle area with a seven-foot diameter in 1906, and the weight of the shot was standardised to 16\u00a0pounds (7.26\u00a0kg). Throwing technique was also refined over this period, with bent arm throws being banned as they were deemed too dangerous and the side-step and throw technique arising in the United States in 1876.  The shot put has been an Olympic sport for men since 1896 and a women's competition using a 4\u00a0kg (8.82\u00a0lb) shot was added in 1948. Further throwing techniques have arisen since the post-war era: in the 1950s Parry O'Brien popularised the 180 degree turn and throw technique commonly known as the \"glide\", breaking the world record 17 times along the way, while Aleksandr Baryshnikov and Brian Oldfield introduced the \"spin\" or rotational technique in 1976.  Discus throw  In the discus throw, athletes compete to throw a heavy disc the farthest. In standard competitions, athletes throw the disc from a set circular arc and take turns in a series of throw, with the singular best effort deciding the victor. As one of the events within the ancient pentathlon, the history of the discus throw dates back to 708 BC. In ancient times a heavy circular disc was thrown from a set standing position on a small pedestal, and it was this style that was revived for the 1896 Olympics. This continued until the 1906 Intercalated Games in Athens, which featured both the ancient style and the increasingly popular modern style of turning and throwing. By the 1912 Olympics, the ancient standing throw style had fallen into disuse and contests starting within a 2.5\u00a0m squared throwing area became the standard. The discus implement was standardised to 2\u00a0kg (4.4\u00a0pounds) in weight and 22\u00a0cm (8\u00a0inches) in diameter in 1907. The women's discus was among the first women's events on the Olympic programme, being introduced in 1928. The first modern athlete to throw the discus while rotating the whole body was Czech athlete Franti\u0161ek Janda-Suk, who invented the technique when studying the position of the famous statue of Discobolus and won the 1900 Olympic silver medal.  Javelin throw  As an implement of war and hunting, javelin throwing began in prehistoric times. Along with the discus, the javelin was the second throwing event in the ancient Olympic pentathlon. Records from 708 BC show two javelin competition types co-existing: throwing at a target and throwing the javelin for distance. It was the latter type from which the modern event derives. In ancient competitions, athletes would wrap an ankyle (thin leather strip) around the javelin that acted as a sling to facilitate extra distance. The javelin throw gained much popularity in Scandinavia in the late 19th century and athletes from the region are still among the most dominant throwers in men's competitions. The modern event features a short run up on a track and then the thrower releases the javelin before the foul line. The runway measures at a minimum of 30m in length, and is covered with the same surface as the track.  The first Olympic men's javelin throw contest was held in 1908 and a women's competition was introduced in 1932. The first javelins were made of various types of wood, but in the 1950s, former athlete Bud Held introduced a hollow javelin, then a metal javelin, both of which increased throwers performances. Another former athlete, Mikl\u00f3s N\u00e9meth invented the rough-tailed javelin and throws reached in excess of 100\u00a0m \u2013 edging towards the limits of stadia. The distances and the increasing number of horizontal landings led the IAAF to redesign the men's javelin to reduce distance and increase the implement's downward pitching moment to allow for easier measurement. Rough-tailed designs were banned in 1991 and all marks achieved with such javelins were removed from the record books. The women's javelin underwent a similar redesign in 1999. The current javelin specifications are 2.6 to 2.7\u00a0m in length and 800\u00a0grams in weight for men, and 2.2 to 2.3\u00a0m and 600\u00a0g for women.  Hammer throw  The earliest recorded precursors to the modern hammer throw stem from the Tailteann Games of ancient Ireland, which featured events such as throwing either a weight attached to a rope, a large rock on a wooden handle, or even a chariot wheel on a wooden axle. Other ancient competitions included throwing a cast iron ball attached to a wooden handle \u2013 the root of the term \"hammer throw\" due to their resemblance to the tools. In 16th century England, contests involving the throwing of actual blacksmith's Sledgehammers were recorded. The hammer implement was standardised in 1887 and the competitions began to resemble the modern event. The weight of the metal ball was set at 16\u00a0pounds (7.26\u00a0kg) while the attached wire had to measure between 1.175\u00a0m and 1.215\u00a0m.  The men's hammer throw became an Olympic event in 1900 but the women's event \u2013 using a 4\u00a0kg (8.82\u00a0lb) weight \u2013 was not widely competed until much later, finally featuring on the women's Olympic programme in 2000. The distances thrown by male athletes became greater from the 1950s onwards as a result of improved equipment using the denser metals, a switch to concrete throwing areas, and more advanced training techniques. Professional hammer throwers were historically large, strong, sturdy athletes. However, qualities such as refined technique, speed and flexibility have become increasingly important in the modern era as the legal throwing area has been reduced from 90 to 34.92 degrees and throwing technique involves three to four controlled rotations.  Combined events  Combined (or multi-discipline) events are competitions in which athletes participate in a number of track and field events, earning points for their performance in each event, which adds to a total points score. Outdoors, the most common combined events are the men's decathlon (ten events) and the women's heptathlon (seven events). Due to stadium limitations, indoor combined events competition have a reduced number of events, resulting in the men's heptathlon and the women's pentathlon. Athletes are allocated points based on an international-standard points scoring system, such as the decathlon scoring table.  The Ancient Olympic pentathlon (comprising long jump, javelin, discus, the stadion race and wrestling) was a precursor to the track and field combined events and this ancient event was restored at the 1906 Summer Olympics (Intercalated Games). A men's all-around was held at the 1904 Summer Olympics, contested between five American and two British athletes.  Stadiums  Outdoor  The term track and field is intertwined with the stadiums that first hosted such competitions. The two basic features of a track and field stadium are the outer oval-shaped running track and an area of turf within this track\u2014the field. In earlier competitions, track lengths varied: the Panathinaiko Stadium measured 333.33\u00a0metres at the 1896 Summer Olympics, while at the 1904 Olympics the distance was a third of a mile (536.45\u00a0m) at Francis Field. As the sport developed, the IAAF standardised the length to 400\u00a0m and stated that the tracks must be split into six to eight running lanes. Precise widths for the lanes were established, as were regulations regarding the curvature of the track. Tracks made of flattened cinders were popular in the early 20th century but synthetic tracks became standard in the late 1960s. 3M's Tartan track (an all-weather running track of polyurethane) gained popularity after its use at the 1968 US Olympic Trials and the 1968 Summer Olympics and it began the process in which synthetic tracks became the standard for the sport. Many track and field stadiums are multi-purpose stadiums, with the running track surrounding a field built for other sports, such as the various types of football.  The field of the stadium combines a number of elements for use in the jumping and throwing events. The long jump and triple jump areas comprise a straight, narrow 40-metre running track with a sandpit at one or both ends. Jumps are measured from a take off board\u2014typically a small strip of wood with a plasticine marker attached\u2014which ensures athletes jump from behind the measurement line. The pole vault area is also a 40-metre running track and has an indentation in the ground (the box) where vaulters plant their poles to propel themselves over a crossbar before falling onto cushioned landing mats. The high jump is a stripped-down version of this, with an open area of track or field that leads to a crossbar with a square area of landing mats behind it.  The four throwing events generally all begin on one side of the stadium. The javelin throw typically takes place on a piece of track that is central and parallel to the straights of the main running track. The javelin throwing area is a sector shape frequently across the Pitch (sports field) in the middle of the stadium, ensuring that the javelin has a minimal chance of causing damage or injury. The discus throw and hammer throw contests begin in a tall metal cage usually situated in one of the corners of the field. The cage reduces the danger of implements being thrown out of the field of play and throws travel diagonally across the field in the centre of the stadium. The shot put features a circular throwing area with a toe board at one end. The throwing area is a sector. Some stadia also have a water jump area on one side of the field specifically for steeplechase races.  Indoor Basic indoor venues may be adapted gymnasiums, which can easily accommodate high jump competitions and short track events. Full-size indoor arenas (i.e. those fully equipped to host all events for the World Indoor Championships) bear similarities with their outdoor equivalents. Typically, a central area is surrounded by a 200-metre oval track with four to eight lanes. The track can be banked at the turns to allow athletes to run around the radius more comfortably. Some have a second running track going straight across the field area, parallel to the straights of the main circuit. This track is used for the 60 metres and 60 metres hurdles events, which are held almost exclusively indoors.  Another common adaptation in the United States is a 160-yard track (11 laps to a mile) that fits into a common basketball court-sized arena. This was quite popular when races were held at imperial distances, which gradually was phased out by different organizations in the 1970s and 1980s. Examples of this configuration include the Millrose Games at Madison Square Garden, and the Sunkist Invitational formerly held in the Los Angeles Sports Arena.  All four of the common jumping events are held at indoor venues. The long and triple jump areas run alongside the central 60\u00a0m track and are mostly identical in form to their outdoor counterparts. The pole vault track and landing area are also alongside the central running track. Shot put and weight throw are the only throwing events held indoors due to size restrictions. The throwing area is similar to the outdoor event, but the landing sector is a rectangular section surrounded by netting or a stop barrier.  In addition to hosting the World Indoor Championships, the IAAF has hosted the IAAF World Indoor Tour since 2016.  Starts use in race  Track rules The rules of track events in athletics as observed in most international athletics competitions are set by the Competition Rules of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). The most recent complete set of rules is the 2009 rules that relate only to competitions in 2009. Key rules of track events are those regarding starting, running and finishing. Current World Athletics (WA) Rules are available on WA's website . Current USATF (USA) Competition Rules booklet is available on the USATF website . Prior USATF Competition Rules booklets are also available (2002, 2006 to 2020) .  Starting  The start of a race is marked by a white line 5\u00a0cm wide. In all races that are not run in lanes the start line must be curved, so that all the athletes start the same distance from the finish. Starting blocks may be used for all races up to and including 400 m (including the first leg of the 4 \u00d7 100 m and 4 \u00d7 400 m) and may not be used for any other race. No part of the starting block may overlap the start line or extend into another lane.  All races must be started by the report of the starter's gun or approved starting apparatus fired upwards after they have ascertained that athletes are steady and in the correct starting position. An athlete may not touch either the start line or the ground in front of it with their hands or feet when on their marks.  For sprint races up to 400\u00a0m, the starter gives two commands: \"on your marks\" to instruct athletes to approach the start line, followed by \"set\" to advise the athletes that the start of the race is imminent. The commands of the starter are typically given in the native language in national competitions, or in English or French in international competitions. Once all athletes are set in their starting position, the gun or an approved starting apparatus must be fired or activated. If the starter is not satisfied that all are ready to proceed, the athletes may be called out of the blocks and the process started over.  There are different types of starts for races of different distances. Middle- and long-distance races mainly use the waterfall start. This is when all athletes begin on a curved line that moves farther out at the outer edge of the track. Competitors are allowed to move towards the inside lane right away, as long as it is safe to do so. For some middle-distance races, such as 800\u00a0m, each athlete starts in their own lane. Once the gun fires, they must run in the lane they began in until markers on the track notify them it is time to move towards the inside lane. For sprint races, athletes begin in start blocks and must stay in their own lane for the entire race.  An athlete, after assuming a final set position, may not commence his starting motion until after receiving the report of the gun, or approved starting apparatus. If, in the judgment of the starter or recallers, he does so any earlier, it is considered a false start. It is deemed a false start if, in the judgment of the starter an athlete fails to comply with the commands \"on your marks\" or \"set\" as appropriate after a reasonable time; or an athlete after the command \"on your marks\" disturbs other athletes in the race through sound or otherwise. If the runner is in the \"set\" position and moves, then the runner is also disqualified. , any athlete making a false start is disqualified.  In International elite competition, electronically tethered starting blocks sense the reaction time of the athletes. If the athlete reacts in less than 0.1 second, an alert sounds for a recall starter and the offending athlete is guilty of a false start. Since 2009, the offending athletes are immediately disqualified.  Running the race  For sprinting events (bar the 4 \u00d7 400\u00a0m relay and the indoor 400\u00a0metres), each athlete must run the race within their allocated lane from start to finish. If an athlete leaves their lane or steps on the line demarking each lane the athlete will be disqualified. Lane rules also apply for initial periods of other track races, for example, the beginning of the 800\u00a0m. Similar rules apply for longer distance races when a large field of athletes is present and separate starting points are designated, with the field merging into one group shortly after the starting phase.  Any athlete who jostles or obstructs another athlete, in a way that impedes his progress, should be disqualified from that event. However, if an athlete is pushed or forced by another person to run outside his lane, and if no material advantage is gained, the athlete should not be disqualified.  The finish The finish of a race is marked by a white line 5\u00a0cm wide. The finishing position of athletes is determined by the order in which any part of their torso (as distinguished from the head, neck, arms, legs, hands or feet) reaches the vertical plane of the nearer edge of the finish line. Fully automatic timing systems (photo timing) are becoming more and more common at increasingly lower levels of track meets, improving the accuracy, while eliminating the need for eagle-eyed officials on the finish line. Fully automatic timing (FAT) is required for high level meets and any time a sprint record is set (though distance records can be accepted if timed by three independent stopwatches).  With the accuracy of the timing systems, ties are rare. Ties between different athletes are resolved as follows: In determining whether there has been a tie in any round for a qualifying position for the next round based on time, a judge (called the chief photo finish judge) must consider the actual time recorded by the athletes to one thousandth of a second. If the judge decides that there has been a tie, the tying athletes must be placed in the next round or, if that is not practicable, lots must be drawn to determine who must be placed in the next round. In the case of a tie for first place in any final, the referee decides whether it is practicable to arrange for the athletes so tying to compete again. If he decides it is not, the result stands. Ties in other placings remain.  Field rules In general, most field events allow a competitor to take their attempt individually, under theoretically the same conditions as the other competitors in the competition. Each attempt is measured to determine who achieved the greatest distance.  Vertical Jumps  Vertical jumps (high jump and pole vault) set a bar at a particular height. The competitor must clear the bar without knocking it off the standards that are holding the bar (flat). Three failures in a row ends the competitor's participation in the event. The competitor has the option to PASS their attempt, which can be used to strategic advantage (of course that advantage is lost if the competitor misses). A pass could be used to save energy and avoid taking a jump that would not improve their position in the standings. After all competitors have either cleared, passed or failed their attempts at a height, the bar goes up. The amount the bar goes up is predetermined before the competition, though when one competitor remains, that competitor may choose their own heights for the remaining attempts. A record is kept of each attempt by each competitor. After all competitors have taken their attempts, the one jumping the highest is the winner, and so on down the other competitors in the event. Ties are broken by first, the number of attempts taken at the highest height (fewest wins), and then if still tied, by the total number of misses in the competition as a whole. The bar does not go back to a lower height except to break a tie for first place or a qualifying position. If those critical positions are still tied after applying the tiebreakers, all tied competitors take a fourth jump at the last height. If they still miss, the bar goes down one increment where they again jump. This process continues until the tie is broken.  Horizontal Jumps  Horizontal jumps (long jump and triple jump) and all throws must be initiated behind a line. In the case of horizontal jumps, that line is a straight line perpendicular to the runway. In the case of throws, that line is an arc or a circle. Crossing the line while initiating the attempt invalidates the attempt\u2014it becomes a foul. All landings must occur in a sector. For the jumps, that is a sand filled pit, for throws it is a defined sector. A throw landing on the line on the edge of sector is a foul (the inside edge of the line is the outside edge of the sector). Assuming a proper attempt, officials measure the distance from the closest landing point back to the line. The measuring tape is carefully straightened to the shortest distance between the point and the line. To accomplish this, the tape must be perfectly perpendicular to the take off line in jumps, or is pulled through the center point of the arc for throws. The officials at the landing end of the tape have the zero, while the officials at the point of initiation measure and record the length. Whenever a record (or potential record) occurs, that measurement is taken (again) with a steel tape, and observed by at least three officials (plus usually the meet referee). Steel tapes are easily bent and damaged, so are not used to measure everyday competitions. For major competitions, each competitor gets three tries. The top competitors (usually 8 or 9 depending on that competition's rules or the number of lanes on the track) gets three more tries. At that level of competition, the order of competitors for those final three attempts are set\u2014so the competitor in first place at the end of the third round is last, while the last competitor to qualify goes first. Some meets rearrange the competition order again for the final round, so the final attempt is taken by the leader at that point. At other competitions, meet management may choose to limit all competitors to four or three attempts. Whatever the format, all competitors get an equal number of attempts.  Equipment Men and women have different weights for their throwing implements \u2013 men's javelin is 800 grams compared to 600 for women, men's weight throw is 35 pounds compared to 20 for women, men's discus is 2 kilograms to women's 1, men's shot put is 16 pounds compared to 8 pounds for women, and men's hammer throw is also 16 pounds to the women's 8. Additionally, men's high hurdles are at height of 42 inches compared to women's hurdles which are 33 inches. For the intermediate hurdles (400 meter hurdles), the men's hurdle height is 36 inches compared to 30 inches for women.  Organizations The international governance of track and field falls under the jurisdiction of athletics organisations. World Athletics is the global governing body for track and field, and athletics as a whole. The governance of track and field at continental and national level is also done by athletics bodies. Some national federations are named after the sport, including USA Track & Field and the Philippine Amateur Track & Field Association, but these organisations govern more than just track and field and are in fact athletics governing bodies. These national federations regulate sub-national and local track and field clubs, as well as other types of running clubs.  Competitions  Olympics, Paralympics and world championships  The major global track and field competitions are both held under the scope of athletics. Track and field contests make up the majority of events on the Olympic and Paralympic athletics programmes, which occur every four years. Track and field events have held a prominent position at the Summer Olympics since its inception in 1896, and the events are typically held in the main stadium of the Olympic and Paralympic Games. Events such as the 100 metres receive some of the highest levels of media coverage of any Olympic or Paralympic sporting event.  The other two major international competition for track and field are organised by the IAAF. The IAAF had selected the Olympic competition as its world championship event in 1913, but a separate world championships for athletics alone was first held in 1983 \u2013 the IAAF World Championships in Athletics. The championships comprised track and field competitions plus the marathon and racewalking competitions. Initially, this worked on a quadrennial basis but, after 1991, it changed to a biennial format. In terms of indoor track and field, the IAAF World Indoor Championships has been held every two years since 1985 and this is the only world championships that consists of solely track and field events.  Other championships  Similar to the event programmes at the Olympics, Paralympics and World Championships, track and field forms a significant part of continental championships. The South American Championships in Athletics, created in 1919, was the first continental championships and the European Athletics Championships became the second championships of this type in 1934. The Asian Athletics Championships and African Championships in Athletics were created in the 1970s and Oceania started its championships in 1990.  There are also indoor continental competitions in Europe (European Athletics Indoor Championships) and Asia (Asian Indoor Athletics Championships). There has not been a consistent championships for all of North America, which may be (in part) due to the success of both the Central American and Caribbean Championships and the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships. Most countries have a national championship in track and field and, for athletes, these often play a role in gaining selection into major competitions. Some countries hold many track and field championships at high school and college-level, which help develop younger athletes. Some of these have gained significant exposure and prestige, such as the NCAA Track and Field Championship in the United States and the Jamaican High School Championships. However, the number and status of such competitions significantly vary from country to country.  Multi-sport events  Mirroring the role that track and field events have at the Summer Olympics and Paralympics, the sport is featured within the athletics programmes of many major multi-sport events. Among some of the first of these events to follow the Olympic-style model were the World University Games in 1923, the Commonwealth Games in 1930, and the Maccabiah Games in 1932. The number of major multi-sport events greatly increased during the 20th century and thus did the number of track and field events held within them. Typically, track and field events are hosted at the main stadium of the games.  After the Olympic and Paralympic Games, the most prominent events for track and field athletes include the three IOC-sanctioned continental games: the All-Africa Games, Asian Games, and the Pan American Games. Other games such as the Commonwealth Games and Summer Universiade, and World Masters Games have significant participation from track and field athletes. Track and field is also present at the national games level, with competitions such as the Chinese National Games serving as the most prestigious national competition for domestic track and field athletes.  Meetings {main|Track and field meeting}} As of May 2010, no such article --> One-day track and field meetings form the most common and seasonal aspect of the sport \u2013 they are the most basic level of track and field competition. Meetings are generally organised annually either under the patronage of an educational institution or sports club, or by a group or business that serves as the meeting promoter. In the case of the former, athletes are selected to represent their club or institution. In the case of privately run or independent meetings, athletes participate on an invitation-only basis.  The most basic type of meetings are all-comers track meets, which are largely small, local, informal competitions that allow people of all ages and abilities to compete. As meetings become more organized they can gain official sanctioning by the local or national association for the sport.  At the professional level, meetings began to offer significant financial incentives for all athletes in the 1990s in Europe with the creation of the \"Golden Four\" competition, comprising meetings in Z\u00fcrich, Brussels, Berlin and Oslo. This expanded and received IAAF backing as the IAAF Golden League in 1998, which was later supplemented by the branding of selected meetings worldwide as the IAAF World Athletics Tour. In 2010, the Golden League idea was expanded globally as the Diamond League series and this now forms the top tier of professional one-day track and field meetings.  World rankings  The IAAF World Rankings system was introduced for the 2018 season. An athlete's position within the ranking will be determined by points scored based on their performance and importance of the competition. The points will be considered for eligibility for the World Athletics Championships and Olympic Games. This system will affect athlete participation, which has typically been determined by national bodies, either through selection panels or national trials events.  Records  Athletes performances are timed or measured at virtually all track and field competitions. Doing so can not only serve as a way of determining the winner in an event, but it can also be used for historical comparison (i.e. a record). A large variety of record types exist and men's and women's performances are recorded separately. The foremost types of records organise athlete's performances by the region they represent\u2014beginning with national records, then continental records, up to the global or world record level. National governing bodies control the national record lists, the area associations organise their respective continental lists, and the IAAF ratifies world records.  The IAAF ratifies track and field world records if they meet their set criteria. The IAAF first published a world records list in 1914, initially for men's events only. There were 53 recognised records in running, hurdling and relay, and 12 field records. World records in women's events began in 1936 as more events were gradually added to the list, but significant changes were made in the late 1970s. First, all records in imperial measurements were abandoned in 1976, with the sole exceptional being the mile run due to the prestige and history of the event. The following year, all world records in sprint events would only be recognised if fully automatic electronic timing was used (as opposed to the traditional hand-timing stopwatch method). In 1981, electronic timing was made compulsory for all world record runs in track and field, with times being recorded to within one hundredth of a second. Two additional types of world record were introduced in 1987: world records for indoor competitions, and world records for junior athletes under 20 years old.  The next most important record type are those achieved at a specific competition. For example, the Olympic records represent the best performances by athletes at the Summer Olympics. All major championships and games have their relevant competition records and a large number of track and field meetings keep a note of their meet records. Other record types include: stadium records, records by age range, records by disability, and records by institution or organisation. Cash bonuses are usually offered to athletes if they break significant records, as doing so can generate greater interest and public attendance in track and field competitions.  Doping  Track and field athletes are banned from ingesting or using certain substances by governing bodies for the sport, from the national to the international level. The IAAF's constitution incorporates the World Anti-Doping Code among other anti-doping measures. Practices such as blood doping and the use of anabolic steroids, peptide hormones, stimulants, or diuretics can give athletes a physical competitive advantage in track and field. The use of such substances in track and field is opposed on both ethical and medical grounds. Given that the sport functions by measuring and comparing athletes' performances, performance-enhancing substances create an uneven playing field \u2014 athletes who do not use doping substances have a disadvantage over rivals who do. Medically, the use of banned substances may have an adverse effect upon athletes' health. However, some exemptions are made for athletes who take banned substances for therapeutic use, and athletes are not sanctioned for usage in these cases, such as Kim Collins' failed drug test due to asthma medication.  Athletes have historically been willing to take legal and health risks to improve their performance, with some even stating their willingness to risk their lives, as exemplified by research by Mirkin, Goldman and Connor in researching attitudes to the so-called Goldman dilemma. To prevent use of performance-enhancing substances, athletes must submit to drug tests that are conducted both in and out of competition by anti-doping officials or accredited medical staff. Penalized athletes are susceptible to higher testing upon return to competition. Athletes found to have taken substances on the World Anti-Doping Agency's banned list receive sanctions and may be banned from competition for a period of time that corresponds to the seriousness of the infraction. However, the use of substances not on the prohibited list may also result in sanctions if the substance is deemed similar to a banned substance in either composition or effect. Athletes may also be sanctioned for missing tests, seeking to avoid testing or tampering with results, refusing to submit to testing, through circumstantial evidence, or confession of use.  Doping has played a significant part in the modern history of track and field. State-sponsored doping in East Germany with hormones and anabolic steroids marked the rise of women from East Germany in track and field from the late 1960s to the 1980s. A number of these women, such as Marita Koch, broke world records and were highly successful at international competitions. Some athletes, who were following a doping plan from their teenage years, suffered significant health problems as a result of the regime. A similar state-sponsored doping system was developed in the Soviet Union. In 2016, The New York Times published an article detailing the use of doping by the Soviets in preparation for the 1984 Olympics. Ben Johnson ran a new world record in the 100\u00a0metres at the 1988 Seoul Olympics but was later banned for using anabolic steroids. In the mid-first decade of the 21st century, the BALCO Scandal eventually resulted in the downfall of prominent sprinters such as Marion Jones and Tim Montgomery, among others, through their usage of banned substances. The revelation state-sponsored doping in Russia led to an international ban on all its athletes in 2016, with Russians having to apply to the IAAF to compete as Authorised Neutral Athletes at events such as the 2016 Summer Olympics and 2017 World Championships in Athletics. Doping has affected countries on all continents and has occurred in individual, team and national settings.  Related sports Track and field bears most similarity to the others categorised under the sport of athletics, specifically cross country running, and road forms of racewalking and running. All these forms of racing tend to record finishing times, have strictly defined start and finish points, and are generally individual in nature. Middle- and long-distance runners usually participate in cross country and road events, in addition to the track. Track racewalkers are most typically road specialists as well. It is unusual for track and field athletes outside of these two groups to compete in cross country or road events.  Varieties of strength athletics, such as the World's Strongest Man and highland games, often incorporate forms of footracing, carrying heavy objects, as well as throwing events such as the caber toss and keg toss, which bear similarities to track and field throwing events.

The word \"athletics\" can be used to describe most of the above-mentioned activities, but \"track and field\" and \"athletics\" are generally used to describe most of the events in the sport. Track and field is conducted on a field of play called a stadium, which has a track forming a loop around the field. The track is typically divided into two lanes, each of which one or more athletes may use to run, walk, or skip. The track is usually made of a synthetic material, although tracks made of other materials, such as concrete, are also used. The two primary sports in track and field are track racing and field events. Track races are competitions where athletes race each other in a specified lane to the finish line. Field events are competitions where athletes attempt to mark a target within a designated area of the field of play. Track and field competitions can be organized as a meet, which is a group of competitions held on a single day, or as a championship, which is a group of competitions held over a period of days or weeks. Meets and championships may be organized at the local, regional, state, national, or international levels. In addition to track races and field events, track and field competitions may also include several other types of events. These events include, but are not limited to, the following: * Sprints: A sprint is a short race over a set distance, usually 100, 200, or 400 meters. * Middle distance: Middle-distance races are races over a set distance, usually 400, 800, or 1,500 meters. * Hurdles: Hurdle races are races over a set distance, usually 110 or 400 meters, in which the athlete must jump over a series of obstacles. * Long jump: The long jump is an event where athletes run and jump as far as they can from a standing position. * Pole vault: The pole vault is an event where athletes use a pole to vault over a bar. * Shot put: The shot put is an event where athletes throw a heavy ball as far as they can. * Discus throw: The discus throw is an event where athletes throw a disc as far as they can. * Hammer throw: The hammer throw is an event where athletes throw a hammer as far as they can. Track and field is one of the oldest organized sports in history, with records of competitions dating back to the ancient Olympic Games in Greece. The modern sport of track and field was founded at the first Olympic Games in 1896 in Athens, Greece. Since then, the sport has been one of the main events at the Olympic Games, the World Championships, and many other international competitions.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 194904}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Ekhymosis\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Ekhymosis are a Colombian rock band formed by Juan Esteban \"Juanes\" Aristiz\u00e1bal V\u00e1squez, along with friends Andr\u00e9s Garc\u00eda, Fernando \"Toby\" Tob\u00f3n and Jos\u00e9 David Lopera from Medell\u00edn. The band was created in 1988 with heavy influences from Metallica and other important metal acts of the 80s, as well as some popular Latino music.  Career  Even since their beginning as a metal band, Ekhymosis (Greek:  ecchymosis \"bruise\") showed the same pro-Latino lyrics as Kraken. After some live performances to become known in their city (and more regions of Colombia), the band recorded a demo of two songs, which described the violence in Medell\u00edn and the injustice of innocent deaths and other problems in Colombia. The demo sold out (thanks to friends and family of the band), and they decided to record a second. This time Ekhymosis had luck: In the studio was a Codiscos representative; she heard and liked the demo and the band signed with that label.  1993 saw the release of Ni\u00f1o Gigante, a heavy metal album that included one of the band's most well known songs, \"Solo\". Controversy and the term \"sell-out\" surrounded the band with their next release: 1994's Ciudad Pac\u00edfico, produced by Federico L\u00f3pez, a more hard rock-oriented record with more Latin sounds. Ekhymosis was looking for their unique sound; they didn't want to be the \"Spanish Metallica\". Rather, they wanted to create Colombian rock.  In the following year, 1995, the band with its two new members, released Amor Biling\u00fce, topping the Colombian charts with the single \"De Madrugada\". The video of the song had incredible replay value on MTV Latino. The same year, Ekhymosis recorded a rock version of the National Anthem of Colombia, which caused controversy among some, but was well received among Colombian youth. Ekhymosis was the chosen band to open for Bon Jovi in November of that year, but due to the murder of the politician Alvaro G\u00f3mez the band decided not to play in order to allow the concert to finish earlier.  The next year, the band released their unplugged album, titled Ac\u00fastico, and Ekhymosis decided to go to Los Angeles where they played in local pubs and began recording their new album. In 1996, the band, now with four members (Juan Esteban, Andr\u00e9s, Toby and Jos\u00e9) recorded in L.A. their self-titled album, which saw the re-makes of three of their best songs (\"Solo\", \"Sin Rencores\", \"De Madrugada\") and new ones, the most remarkable being \"La Tierra\", known by some fans as \"the second Colombian Anthem\". The band was at its peak, but little knew the fans that those were the last days of one of the most important bands in Colombia.  In 1997, Ekhymosis won 3 Shock Awards (Best National Group, Best Song for \"La Tierra\", and Best Composer for Juan Esteban). Some months later, due to internal problems in deciding the future of the band, Ekhymosis disbanded. Juan Esteban, then, began his solo career as Juanes; the drummer of the band, Jose Lopera, worked with him on his first album, and has continued to work with Juanes to this day; the guitarist of Ekhymosis, Toby, started to play with Juanes on his second album and has continued with Juanes as well. Juanes has been known to perform Ekhymosis songs at his concerts, namely \"Solo\" and \"La Tierra\".  Reunion   In 2012, the band announced a reunion with new members, in a rendition to their origins as a thrash metal band, and playing their early songs before 1992.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Tianjin CTF Finance Centre\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Tianjin CTF Finance Center is a super-tall skyscraper in Tianjin, China. Construction started in 2013 and was completed in 2019. The tower is the second tallest building in Tianjin after Goldin Finance 117, eighth tallest building in the world, and the tallest building in the world with fewer than 100 floors. It is located in the outer district of the Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area. Tianjin CTF Finance Center is designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill LLP in collaboration with Ronald Lu & Partners.  Design  The building commonly designed as the softly curving glass skin integrates eight sloping mega-columns that follow a lyrical line connecting the centers and corners of all four elevations. These curving mega-columns increase the structure's response to seismic concerns and are integral to both the gravity and lateral systems. They are effective in increasing the stiffness of the building's perimeter frame, consequently attracting a larger portion of the seismic forces in compliance with the Chinese code requirements.  The fa\u00e7ade reinforces the curvature of the tower form and creates a shimmering texture over the building's surface. The crystalline-like curtain wall stretches from the suspended glass canopies at each of the lobbies to the dematerialized, mega-column-looped crown and presents a bold expression of a comprehensive, integrated design on the Tianjin skyline.  Features  By stacking reducing floor plates, the tower tapers dramatically to minimize the surface area exposed to wind, sun, and moisture. The gently-undulating curves of the facade subtly denote the integration of the three distinct programs within a singular smooth object. Square in plan with rounded corners, the floor plate geometry enables unique interior fit-outs and customization options for occupants. Research by the architect has shown that lateral forces due to vortex shedding can be controlled by tapering the vertical profile of the tower and softening any sharp corners in plan. The building's aerodynamic shape greatly reduces this vortex shedding by \u201cconfusing the wind\u201d and disrupting the opportunity for any resonating wind forces and loads on the structure.  Construction process  On November 20, 2009, Tianjin Chow Tai Fook Financial Center held a groundbreaking ceremony. The then Tianjin Mayor Huang Xingguo attended the ceremony. The Tianjin CTF Finance Centre was proposed as an idea in 2011. As of April 2016, one third of the entire building has been built. In July 2016, the core tube of the building was poured to 260 meters. In September 2016, the building was built as a transition truss between the office building and the serviced residential part. In April 2017, CTBUH confirmed that the building has been structurally topped. In May 2017, the steel structure on the top of this building began to be installed. On October 31, 2017, the steel structure crown was sealed. The building was completed in September 2019.  Building shape  Tianjin Chow Tai Fook Financial Center (old plan) is a polyline-shaped building with a square shape as the base, and the shape is tapered from bottom to top. In the design effect, in the daytime, the building will refract the sunlight to show various colors, and at night, the top of the inclined tower glows like a diamond. The new plan is rocket-shaped and dominated by arcs; the crown is like a cicada's wings.

Estimations vary as to the abruptness of the reversal. A 2004 paper estimated that it took over several thousand years; a 2010 paper estimated that it occurred more quickly, perhaps within a human lifetime; a 2019 paper estimated that the reversal lasted 22,000 years.  The apparent duration at any particular location can vary by an order of magnitude, depending on geomagnetic latitude and local effects of non-dipole components of the Earth's field during the transition.  The Brunhes\u2013Matuyama reversal is a Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP), selected by the International Commission on Stratigraphy as a marker for the beginning of the Middle Pleistocene, also known as the Ionian Stage. It is useful in dating ocean sediment cores and subaerially erupted volcanics. There is a highly speculative theory that connects this event to the large Australasian strewnfield (c. 790,000 years ago), although the causes of the two are almost certainly unconnected and only coincidentally happened at the same time. Adding to the data is the large African Bosumtwi impact event (c. 1.07 million years ago) and the later Jaramillo reversal (c. 1 million years ago), another pair of events which has not gone unnoticed.

The event has been dated to the abrupt onset of the Matuyama period, an interval of reversed polarity in the Earth's magnetic field, which has lasted until the present day. The Earth's magnetic field is a vector quantity, characterized by both strength and direction, and is a result of the convection currents in the Earth's liquid core. The Earth's core has an internal magnetic field that is approximately equal in strength to the field observed on the Earth's surface. However, the direction of the internal magnetic field is opposite to that of the surface field: the north magnetic pole is located in the Earth's south, and vice versa. The Earth's field is the result of the interaction of the internal field with the surface field, and is characterized by a number of different components. The Brunhes\u2013Matuyama reversal is the most recent magnetic reversal of the Earth's surface field. The previous reversal, the Olduvai event, occurred approximately 1.5 million years ago. There have been at least 100 reversals in the last 70 million years. The Brunhes\u2013Matuyama reversal was first identified in 1906 by the French geophysicist Bernard Brunhes. Brunhes discovered the event by studying the magnetic properties of samples of volcanic rocks from the Pacific coast of Japan, which had been collected during a Japanese expedition to the Bonin Islands in 1895. The samples were of the right age to be associated with the Brunhes\u2013Matuyama reversal, and the reversal was eventually confirmed by the measurement of the magnetic properties of other rocks and sediments. The Brunhes\u2013Matuyama reversal is of particular interest because it corresponds to a period of dramatic climate change, including a number of rapid and intense glacial episodes. The reversal also corresponds to a period of increased volcanic activity, and a number of large volcanic eruptions have been dated to the Brunhes\u2013Matuyama period. The Brunhes\u2013Matuyama reversal is thought to have been caused by a process of secular variation, in which the Earth's magnetic field slowly changes in strength and direction over time. The secular variation is thought to be driven by the convection currents in the Earth's core, which are in turn driven by the heat from the Earth's interior. The Brunhes\u2013Matuyama reversal was a particularly intense episode of secular variation, and the sudden change in the direction of the Earth's magnetic field had a number of dramatic effects on the Earth's climate and environment.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1132221}

Biography He was born at Groningen, where he studied for the church. He went on to the University of Leiden, applying himself specially to Hebrew and the cognate tongues. His thesis Dissertatio theologico-philologica de utilitate linguae Arabicae in interpretenda sacra lingua (\"The Use of Arabic in the Interpretation of Scripture\") appeared in 1706. After a visit to Reland in Utrecht, he returned to Groningen (1708); then, having taken his degree in theology (1709), he returned to Leiden, and devoted himself to the study of the manuscript collections there until 1711, when he became pastor at Wassenaer.  He disdained parochial work and decided to accept the Hebrew chair at Franeker in 1713. He held this position until 1729, when he was transferred to Leiden as rector of the collegium theologicum, or seminary for poor students. From 1732 until his death (at Leiden) he was professor of Oriental languages at Leiden.  Schultens was the chief teacher of the Arabic language in the whole of the Europe during his lifetime. In some sense, he revived Arabic studies. He differed from J. J. Reiske and Silvestre de Sacy in regarding Arabic as a handmaid to Hebrew. Reiske considered Schultens' treatment of Arabic to be of little value, also maintaining that Arabic studies should not be taught as part of theology, but as a subject matter in its own right, as was mathematics, physics, geography and medicine. Schultens vindicated the value of comparative study of the Semitic tongues against those who, like Jacques Gousset, regarded Hebrew as a sacred tongue with which comparative philology has nothing to do.  His principal works were Institutiones ad Fundumenta Lingu\u00e6 Hebraic\u00e6 (1737), Origines Hebraeae (2 vols., 1724, 1738), a second edition of which, with the De defectibus linguae Hebraeae (1731), appeared in 1761; Job (1737); Proverbs (1748); Vetus et regia via hebraezandi (1738); and Monumenta vetustiora Arabum (1740).

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Destiny Fulfilled\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Destiny Fulfilled is the fifth and final studio album by American R&B trio Destiny's Child. It was released on November 16, 2004, by Columbia Records and Sony Urban Music. A comeback release, it marked the return of Destiny's Child after the group went into hiatus, which allowed each member to release solo albums. Unlike their previous material, this record saw each member equally contributing to the songwriting and production. Destiny's Child further worked with frequent collaborators such as Rockwilder, Swizz Beatz and Rodney Jerkins as well as several new producers.  For the album's theme, the members drew inspiration from the conversations they had during the first week of recording when they discussed about the happenings in their lives while being apart. Composed mostly of mid-tempo songs and ballads that are subsequent continuations of each other, altogether telling one complete story, Destiny Fulfilled is an R&B album. It was released to generally mixed reviews among music critics who criticized its mid-tempo ballads and lyrical content. The album was commercially successful; it reached number two on the US Billboard 200, and has since been certified triple Platinum in that region. It was also successful in different countries worldwide receiving certifications in Australia, Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom among others.  As part of the album's promotion, the group performed songs from it on numerous award ceremonies and televised appearances in the US and Europe. They further embarked on the tour Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin' It in 2005 with 67 dates across four continents worldwide. Destiny Fulfilled spawned four singles\u2014the lead single \"Lose My Breath\", \"Soldier\", \"Girl\" and \"Cater 2 U\". After the tour, the group disbanded.  Background   While recording their third studio album Survivor in late 2000, Beyonc\u00e9 announced that Destiny's Child would eventually go on a hiatus that would allow each member to release a solo album, which they hoped would further increase interest in the group. The idea of solo releases emanated from the group's manager, Beyonc\u00e9's father, Mathew Knowles. Kelly Rowland further explained in an interview that Destiny's Child has been present in the media for a long time and they wanted to \"give the public eye a rest from DC for a minute\". During that same interview, she acknowledged that the trio would return to the studio in fall 2003 to start with the work on a new album.  Two members of the group, Beyonc\u00e9 and Rowland each released one album, while Michelle Williams released two. While each member achieved domestic success, Beyonc\u00e9's had been regarded as the most successful with the release of Dangerously in Love (2003), which enjoyed international commercial success and acclaim. This, along with their other ongoing projects, led to speculation over the disbandment of Destiny's Child. Amidst rumors and speculations, Rowland announced in 2004 their return to the studio to record what would become their fourth and final album. The group claimed that the reunion was destined to happen, and that their affinity to each other kept them together.  After this album, the group planned to part ways after their fourteen-year career to facilitate their solo careers. Beyonc\u00e9 has noted that their destinies were already fulfilled; however, Destiny's Child claimed that naming the album Destiny Fulfilled was not a coincidence. Beyonc\u00e9 has said that \"the group felt it still had something to offer musically\" with the album before adding: \"We did this record for ourselves, not to sell a million the first week out... That doesn't mean as much to us as just the fact that three friends got back together to do another record. That was our destiny.\". Rowland commented: \"We were like, 'You know what, we're getting older and we want to end on a high note.' We want to give our fans a great final record\". Beyonc\u00e9, also commented regarding the finality of their career: \"Who knows what will happen in three, five or 10\u00a0years? The main thing is that we maintain our friendship and that we do it because we want to \u2013 not because it's a good business move.\"  Production and recording  Production of the album began in summer of 2004 with Destiny's Child taking help from frequent collaborators including Rockwilder, Swizz Beatz and Rodney Jerkins. The group worked on the album within a period of three weeks. Jerkins, who had worked with Beyonc\u00e9 for her solo album Dangerously in Love, concerned how he would manage the production, saying, \"How is this going to work?' Cause Beyonc\u00e9, she blew up solo, so how's it going to work in a group together?\". He stated that once he got inside the studio, however, his skepticism vanished as he saw the group's \"excitement being back in the studio together\", calling the process \"natural\". The members of the group stated that the first week of recording was spent solely on conversations about the happenings in their lives while being apart from each other as they hadn't spent quality time for a long period. This further inspired them to record the conversations and use it as the main theme of the record.  Differing from Survivor in that previously Beyonc\u00e9 had taken an active role in writing and producing, Destiny Fulfilled saw each member contributing inputs culled from personal experiences and individual opinions and points of view not dependent from the others'. In most cases, producers of the album would send them a CD containing a track that would be the group's basis in the songwriting process; without the producer's supervision of which part to sing, that formed a new direction of their style different from their previous records. The traditional approach where each member sang one verse and chimed in the chorus was replaced; in some songs in Destiny Fulfilled, their vocals were alternated in every line of the lyrics, a technique similar to hip hop artists. Destiny's Child took the role of executive producing alongside their manager, Mathew Knowles. Beyonc\u00e9, who vocally produced the songs, commented that it was important for her to make sure their voices were audible and identifiable. Taking it as one of her goals, the group decided to focus on mid-tempo songs and on few dance numbers and ballads\u2014which they considered people cannot sing with. Beyonc\u00e9 elaborated \"We wanted to make sure that the songs would be something that we were proud of 10 years from now, 20 years from now. We wanted it to be something that people can really feel an emotion to. Up-tempo songs can do that, but they more make you wanna dance.\" As Rowland was recently engaged in the time of the writing of the album, it further influenced her songwriting. She also cited that being apart from the group affected the album as well: \"All of us have been in three different places\u00a0... so there's a lot to talk about, a lot that's gone on, personally. I think it's important to talk about that on this new record, to put what we've been going through separately into the new record.\"  Composition  During an interview with MTV, Beyonc\u00e9 stated that the songs put altogether tell a complete story and noted that each song was a subsequent continuation to the next one. She concluded, \"[The album continues with] this whole journey of this group of women trying to find love. And truly they find it because they love themselves and find it in themselves. It's friendship, it's love, it's maturity and growth, and it's everything that we wanted it to be.\" For the music of the album, the group tried challenging themselves, working with different arrangements, trying to create an original sound; to succeed in this, they were influenced by The Emotions, Jodeci and SWV mixing elements of their music. Destiny Fulfilled is predominantly an R&B concept album tracing a woman's relationship journey. Critics further found elements of soul music, dance and hip-hop. The album is mostly composed of mid and slowtempo balladry following the opening two songs; Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian felt that the ballads showcased \"the girliness in the trio, musically and lyrically\". Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine found elements of middle of the road music in the ballads.  The album opens with the up-tempo dance song \"Lose My Breath\", a track detailing a man full of empty promises to a woman. It is musically complete with military, marching-band drums and keyboard stabs and the backing track contains various sound effects. \"Soldier\", the second track with T.I. and Lil Wayne, the only featured artists on the album, contains elements from Southern hip hop and Crunk&B. Unsatisfied and unfulfilled with the lover from the opening song, the protagonists ask for a decent soldier, further singing about finding a gangster. After finding the soldier, the third song, the R&B number \"Cater 2 U\", lyrically is about submissively serving the man considered as such. Inspired by him, the protagonists sing about doing various things to make him happy musically accompanied by synthesizer as the song builds a crescendo.  The fourth song \"T-Shirt\" is complete with inorganic drum sounds, guitar and backwards loop as the trio sings about sleeping in bed with their man's T-shirt, \"craving his presence, and inhailing his scent\". \"Is She the Reason\" is an R&B ballad which was noted to have a similar chord progression to materials by The Beatles, which lyrically speaks on being in competition with another woman for her mans love & attention. It contains a trumpet-laden sample from Melba Moore's song \"I Don't Know No One Else to Turn To\". The next song, \"Girl\" was noted for its Motown influence and a theme talking about friendship. \"If\", complete with strings, lyrically talks about men who don't appreciate their female lovers until their relationship ends and they realize their mistakes. \"Free\" was described as a \"soul classic from 1975\" with critics also noting elements of 1970s funk music, as the trio speaks on being \"set free\" after being in a relationship where her lover never tending to her desires like she does for him. The midtempo number \"Through with Love\" was noted for having an \"angry\" nature as it talks about a break-up. It contains an undulating piano line as the members of the group sing with restrained vocals and later religious redemption with elements of gospel. In \"Love\", \"capital L kicks the daylights out of the forces of fear, doubt and disappointment\", as the group \"thank[s] God for love\". They further sing about how people \"can't truly love another until [they] love God and then [themselves]\". They further proclaim that they have found love and are \"madly in it\".  Release and promotion   The track listing of Destiny Fulfilled was revealed on October 15, 2004. The album was first released in Japan on November 10, 2004. It was released on November 16, 2004, in North America via Columbia Records. Although the original release was intended to be one day earlier, Columbia Records was concerned about \"potential for Internet leaks and 'burned' CD counterfeits\" that could \"lead consumers to experience inferior and incomplete versions of the album\" which led to the postponement of Destiny Fulfilled.  The group performed \"Lose My Breath\" on ABC's 2004 National Football League \"Opening Kickoff\" special after its online release on September 9, 2004, to break their yearlong hiatus. On October 25, 2004, they appeared at the Radio Music Awards in Las Vegas performing the song with an a cappella jazz opening. The following month they performed three songs from their previous albums and finished with \"Lose My Breath\" on The Oprah Winfrey Show where they also sat down for an interview with Oprah Winfrey. On November 8, 2004, the trio appeared on Total Request Live (TRL) and performed the song along with \"Say My Name\". They went to the German entertainment TV show Wetten, dass..? on November 13, 2004, and performed \"Lose My Breath\". At BET's 106 & Park Destiny's Child performed \"Soldier\" on November 15, 2004. They also performed the song on CBSs The Early Show on December 8, 2004. In early February 2005 they gave another performance of \"Soldier\" at the British show Top of the Pops. At the 2005 NBA All-Star Game on February 20, 2005, they sang both \"Soldier\" and \"Lose My Breath\". They performed the latter song again at the 2005 ESPY Awards on July 13 with the ceremony being aired on ESPN four days later. \"Cater 2 U\" was performed on June 28 during the 2005 BET Awards in Los Angeles.  When the advanced release date of the album was announced, the group confirmed the initial dates of their worldwide tour Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin' It in connection with Destiny Fulfilleds promotion. Promotions of the tour were aired over the radio and television across the United States and the group further collaborated with McDonald's, which served as its sponsor. The tour's set list included songs from Destiny Fulfilled as well as Destiny's Child's previous albums and songs from the solo albums of each member performed individually. Numerous costume changes occurred throughout the show; the concert exhibited products from Beyonc\u00e9's clothing line from the House of Der\u00e9on, a company she co-founded with her mother Tina Knowles. A performance from the tour was filmed in Atlanta on July 15, 2005, and the DVD Destiny's Child Live in Atlanta chronicling the concert was released on March 28, 2006.  Singles  The album's lead single, \"Lose My Breath\", premiered on AOL Music on September 9, 2004, and it was released on  September 21. Its high-mark debut at number 30 on the Billboard Hot 100 prior to its release gave the album an early boost. The single peaked at number three on the chart for the week ending November 6, 2004 giving the group their ninth top ten single. \"Lose My Breath\" topped the Hot Dance Club Songs chart for the week ending January 8, 2005 and was later certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on April 28, 2005, selling 500,000 copies in the US. It was also successful across Europe, peaking at number one on the European Hot 100 Singles chart for the week ending December 4, 2004 spending four consecutive weeks on top. It managed to top the charts in Belgium, Ireland, Italy and Switzerland and it further appeared in the top ten in almost every other chart. The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) used the song as the music for their introductory montage at the 2004 NBA Playoffs and through the first few weeks of the 2005 NBA Playoffs.  \"Soldier\", released on December 7, 2004, peaked at the third position on the Billboard Hot 100 chart becoming the band's tenth top ten single on that chart. It further became the second single from the album to top the Hot Dance Club Songs chart for the week ending February 26, 2005. The RIAA gave it a gold certification for selling 500,000 digital copies in the US. \"Soldier\" further peaked at number four on the UK Singles Chart, number 3 on the ARIA Charts in Australia and appeared in the top 20 in many European countries. The third single from the album, \"Girl\" was released on May 2, 2005, in the UK and on May 17 in the US. It was successful on the ARIA Chart peaking at number five and number six both on the UK Singles Chart and the New Zealand Singles Chart in addition to appearing in other European charts. In the US, it peaked at number 23 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart becoming the lowest charting single there from the album. The fourth and final single from Destiny Fulfilled was \"Cater 2 U\" released in the US and Italy only beginning on June 14, 2005. It peaked at number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number three on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs further being certified gold by the RIAA.  Other songs \"Got's My Own\" was released a promotional single on May 3, 2005.  Critical reception   Destiny Fulfilled received mixed reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 52 based on 17 reviews. Dimitri Ehrlich of Vibe magazine complimented the production of the album, saying that it \"showcases advanced production values\" with \"impressive\" songwriting and vocal abilities and concluded that it \"offers divine satisfaction\". A writer of Billboard felt that Destiny Fulfilled worked as \"a testament to Beyonc\u00e9's evolving multiple talents\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic praised Rowland's and Williams' abilities as vocalists and their contributions to the choruses, but felt that Beyonc\u00e9 \"steals every song on Destiny Fulfilled\" further commending her for sounding \"larger than life even when she's quiet\"; however he concluded, \"as a whole, the album winds up sounding too reserved and heavy-handed, which makes it a disappointment\". Andy Battaglia of The A.V. Club wrote in his review that \"Destiny Fulfilled sounds distant and detached\" further criticizing its mid-tempo ballads for sounding \"uninterrupted at best, uninspired at worst\". Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times commented that it is \"a surprisingly perfunctory disc that never quite justifies its existence\". Alan Ranta of Tiny Mix Tapes doubted Beyonc\u00e9's lyrical sincerity, saying, \"the success of this album depends once again on the complete suspension of die-hard fans' disbelief that Beyonc\u00e9 'Your Ad Here' Knowles could ever actually truly love another human being as much as she loves herself and her possessions.\"  Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian commented that the lead vocals of the songs were likely to be sung by each member equally, noting that it made the album a \"democratic\" one; however she criticized them for squandering \"the extent of their talents\" on the album. Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly also noticed its \"overall air of democracy at work\" and noted that Destiny Fulfilled \"often moves at a molasses-like pace, weighted down with a preponderance of exquisitely executed but ultimately dull ballads\". Jenny Eliscu of Rolling Stone magazine echoed his comments, saying, \"In all but a couple of songs, the verses are divided into three sections, with Beyonce leading things off, followed by Rowland, then Williams\". She noted that after a couple of upbeat songs, \"the album slumps into an endless string of overwrought R&B ballads where the only saving grace is\u00a0... these ladies can harmonize like nobody's business.\" Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine has commented that the ballads of the album build into \"the same sort of standoffish sexual supply-and-demand bartering that has marred their worst tracks\". Most of the critics questioned why Beyonc\u00e9 had to return to Destiny's Child after achieving the most success among the members of the group. Henderson lambasted Beyonc\u00e9 to performing again with the group with the \"full intention\" of taking advantage to bolster her \"divette\" status to superstardom. In May 2006, Destiny Fulfilled was listed at number 24 on a list titled \"The 50 Worst Albums Ever!\" compiled by Q magazine.  Accolades  The album won in the category for Favorite Soul/R&B Album at the 2005 American Music Awards where Destiny's Child also won the Favorite Soul/R&B Band award. At the 2005 Soul Train Music Awards Destiny Fulfilled received an award for Best R&B/Soul Album while \"Soldier\" received Best R&B/Soul Single. The album was nominated in the category for Best Contemporary R&B Album at the 48th Grammy Awards in 2006 but it lost to Mariah Carey's The Emancipation of Mimi. Its singles \"Soldier\" and \"Cater 2 U\" further received nominations in three different categories at the same ceremony. The previous year, \"Lose My Breath\" was nominated in the category for Best R&B Vocal Performance by a Duo Or Group at the 47th Annual Grammy Awards.  Commercial performance   In the United States, the album debuted at number 19 on the Billboard 200 for the week ending November 27, 2004 for amassing sales of 61,000 copies prior to a whole tracking week. In its first official week of sales, Destiny Fulfilled sold over 497,000 copies, with an increase of 713% compared to its early sales; the album's chart position rocketed to number two on the Billboard\u00a0200 for the week ending December 4, 2004. In the same week, it debuted at number one on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart becoming the group's second chart topper following Survivor in 2001. After being removed from the top position for three consecutive weeks, Destiny Fulfilled returned to number one for the week ending January 1, 2005. On January 14, 2005, it was certified triple Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipment of 3,000,000 copies. It emerged as the seventh best-selling album and third best-selling R&B album in 2005. As of October 2009, the album has sold 3.1 million copies in the US according to Nielsen SoundScan. It was ranked at number 133 on the decade-end chart of the best-selling albums in that country for the period between 2000 and 2009. The album peaked at number 3 on the Canadian Albums Chart and was awarded Platinum certification by Music Canada selling 100,000 copies.  In the UK, Destiny Fulfilled debuted at number five on the UK Albums Chart on November 27, 2004, which also became its peak position in that country. Having spent a total of 21 weeks on the chart, it became the group's third album to enter the top ten in the UK until 2005 and the fourth one in their entire career. On November 19, 2004, the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) certified it Platinum for selling 300,000 copies. On the Irish Albums Chart, Destiny Fulfilled debuted and peaked at number 6 on November 18, 2004, becoming Destiny's Child third consecutive top ten album in Ireland. It was also successful in other European countries, peaking at number 3 on the German Albums Chart, further being certified Platinum in that region. In France, Destiny Fulfilled peaked at number nine in its first week on November 14, 2004. It was last seen on the country's albums chart at number 163 on September 3, 2005.  On the Australian ARIA Albums Chart, Destiny Fulfilled debuted at number 11 on November 28, 2004, a position which later became its peak. Spending a total of 31 weeks through 2004 and 2005 ascending and descending the chart, the album was certified Platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for shipment of 70,000 copies in that region. In New Zealand, Destiny Fulfilled peaked at number 21 on April 25, 2005, and the Recorded Music NZ (RMNZ) awarded it with a gold certification for 7,500 copies sold. In Japan, the album debuted and peaked at number four on the Oricon chart due to the success of \"Lose My Breath\" which reached number one on the singles chart there. The album has sold over 625,000 copies there and was certified double Platinum by Oricon making it Destiny's Child's biggest success there to date. It won in the category Rock/Pop Album of the Year International at the 19th Japan Gold Disc Award in 2005 organized by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ). Destiny Fulfilled was named the eighth best-selling album of 2004 worldwide by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI). The album has sold over 7,000,000 copies worldwide.  Disbandment  In a visit at the Palau Sant Jordi in Barcelona, Spain on July 11, 2005, Rowland announced before 16,000 spectators that Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin' It would be Destiny's Child last tour together, revealing their formal disbandment. After their final North American leg, the group parted ways. In a statement released to MTV, the band said that the tour had provided them the opportunity to depart from Destiny's Child on a \"high note\". They also talked about the moment when the group started their musical endeavor and their realizations of pursuing individual careers after working together for several years. Destiny's Child thanked fans for their support while not closing the chance of seeing them continuing each member's goals in music, film, and television. In another interview they explained that their disbandment was planned during the making of the album. While in the studio, they discussed individual aspirations and realized that remaining as a group would prevent them in pursuing those interests. Rowland revealed that they wanted to break up while they were still successful and \"friends [with each other]\". Beyonc\u00e9, however, emphasized that Destiny Fulfilled would not be their last album and disclosed the idea of a possible reunion.

The episode was directed by James L. Conway and written by David A. Goodman and John Shiban. It was first broadcast on UPN on May 26, 2004. The Enterprise crew attempt to find a planet to serve as a new home for the Vulcans, after a massive eruption destroys the planet and its inhabitants. In the process, the crew discovers a hidden NASA facility on the planet, which was used to develop the warp drive. With the Vulcans' future now in the hands of the Enterprise crew, Captain Archer must decide what is best for both the Vulcans and humanity. The episode was the final episode of the series, as the show was cancelled after this episode. A novelization by Diane Carey, published by Pocket Books, was released in July 2004, in which the story is expanded to include a subplot in which the crew deals with the loss of Captain Archer's dog, Porthos. According to Nielsen ratings, the episode was watched by 4.99 million viewers, which was at the time the lowest number of viewers for any episode in the series. The episode was nominated for two Emmy Awards for Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Series and Outstanding Makeup for a Series (non-prosthetic). The two-hour season finale was released as a single-episode DVD on June 15, 2004, and was released as part of the season three DVD set on September 27, 2005. This episode is noted for its numerous references to the original Star Trek series, including the re-use of the classic Star Trek episode \"The Doomsday Machine\" as well as the two-part episode \"The Menagerie\". The episode begins with the Enterprise answering a distress call from the Vulcans. The Vulcans are conducting a religious ceremony in which they are to sacrifice themselves to their god, the red-giant sun of their planet. When the Enterprise arrives, they are too late. The Vulcans have already jumped into the sun, and their planet is destroyed in the process. The Enterprise crew then begins a search for a new planet to serve as a new home for the Vulcans. In the process, they discover a hidden NASA facility on the planet, which was used to develop the warp drive. The Vulcans had discovered the facility and were using it to conduct their religious ceremonies. With the Vulcans' future now in the hands of the Enterprise crew, Captain Archer must decide what is best for both the Vulcans and humanity. He ultimately decides to allow the Vulcans to remain on their new planet, and to continue their traditions.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 972631}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Lorraine 37L\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Lorraine 37L or , (\"tank supply tractor 1937 L\") is a light tracked armoured vehicle developed by the Lorraine company during the interwar period or interbellum, before the Second World War, to an April 1936 French Army requirement for a fully armoured munition and fuel supply carrier to be used by tank units for front line resupply. A prototype was built in 1937 and production started in 1939. In this period, two armoured personnel carriers and a tank destroyer project were also based on its chassis. Mainly equipping the larger mechanised units of the French Infantry arm, the type was extensively employed during the Battle of France in 1940. After the defeat of France, clandestine manufacture was continued in Vichy France, culminating in a small AFV production after the liberation and bringing the total production to about 630 in 1945. Germany used captured vehicles in their original role of carrier and later, finding the suspension system to be particularly reliable, rebuilt many into tank destroyers () of the Marder I type or into self-propelled artillery.  Development In 1934, the order was given to design a munition supply vehicle to increase the operational range of independent tank units. The same year, the Renault 36R was selected for further development; three hundred were ordered from 1938. However, this tractor was only partially armoured; on 17 April 1936, a new set of specifications was drafted for a fully armoured vehicle to deliver fuel and munitions to tanks fighting on the frontline.  Early in 1937, the  company finished a prototype. It was a lengthened version of a proposed replacement type for the 1931 model Renault UE Chenillette tracked infantry supply tractor. In February 1937, the mat\u00e9riel commission, the , was ordered to test the prototype and to complete an evaluation before 1 November 1937, even if testing had not been finished. The prototype was only presented on 9 July and tested until 4 August. It was equipped with a 2371 cc Delahaye four cylinder 124 F engine. Although the vehicle attained a maximum speed of , this dropped to an unacceptably low  when an intended fuel trailer was attached. It was therefore returned to the factory and a more powerful Delahaye 135 engine and stronger clutch were fitted. This vehicle was tested between 22 September and 29 October and achieved the desired .  Production The commission approved the type during late 1937, being especially impressed by the rugged suspension system. It was decided in September 1939 to reserve the total production capacity of the suspension elements for the larger tractor. This implied that the shorter Lorraine replacement for the Renault UE, though also favoured over other candidates, would not be taken into production: an order of hundred made early 1939 was that month shifted towards the longer version.  In 1938, three orders were made: of 78, 100 and another 100 vehicles of the  (TRC 37L); in 1939, before the war, a fourth order of 100 followed, and then a fifth of 74, to which was added the replacement order of 100 for a total of 552. The first vehicle was delivered by Lorraine on 11 January 1939; 212 had been delivered on 1 September 1939.  The ambitious plans made after the outbreak of war for the expansion of the number of armoured divisions meant that the Lorraine 37L orders had to be enlarged accordingly, bringing the total to 1012. The intended initial production rate was fifty per month, to be expanded to seventy. To assist in the manufacture, a second assembly hall was erected by Fouga at B\u00e9ziers, where it was hoped that it could produce at first twenty and later thirty vehicles per month. In reality, this number was never attained; e.g. 20 were made in January, 32 by both companies in May 1940. On 26 May 1940, 432 vehicles had been delivered to the army by Lorraine and Fouga out of 440 produced. Production continued after that date and an estimated total of about 480 to 490 had been reached by 25 June 1940, the end of the Battle of France.  Description Being derived from a  project, the Lorraine 37 L was a rather small vehicle, just 1.57 metres wide. Space had been found by lengthening the chassis to 4.22 metres, making it rather oblong. Lacking a turret or superstructure its height was also not excessive at just 1.215 metres. The small dimensions combined with a light armour \u2014 nine millimetres for the vertical riveted plates, six for the top and bottom and twelve for the cast rounded nose section \u2014 ensured a low weight: the basic TRC 37L weighs just 5.24 metric tonnes empty, the trailer adding 1.2 tonnes.  Given the vehicle's low weight, the suspension was quite robust and exceptionally reliable in comparison with other systems used on French armour of the time, that were either too complicated or too flimsy. Six large road wheels in three pairs of bogies gave a low ground pressure and good weight distribution. Each bogie was allowed a vertical movement in its entirety, sprung by an inverted leaf spring assembly located just below the upper track run, the three assemblies being placed between the four top rollers. The tracks were  wide. The drive sprockets were in the front and driven by a transmission in the nose of the vehicle. The two crew members, the driver on the left, sat in the forward compartment, the drive shaft between them. Entrance to the compartment was by two wide horizontal hatches, the upper hinging upwards, allowing the driver an unobstructed view if opened, the lower hinging downwards.  The centrally positioned engine compartment was separated by a bulkhead from the driver compartment in front of it. The external silencer was on the left of the vehicle under an armoured covering. All vehicles in the series were powered by a Delahaye Type 135 six-cylinder 3.556 litre engine developing  at 2800 rpm, giving a maximum speed of 35\u00a0km/h and an average speed of 20\u00a0km/h. The wading capacity was 60 centimetres, a trench of 130 centimetres could be crossed and an incline of 50% climbed. There was a fuel supply of 114 litres, allowing for a range of 137 kilometres. There were five forward drives and one rear drive.  At the back was an armoured ammunition bin; a load of 810 kilograms can be carried, bringing the weight to 6.05 tonnes. As with the Renault UE, the TRC 37L was supplied with a tracked, armoured trailer with two road wheels per side, mostly used to carry a 565-litre fuel tank to supply the tank units; total load capacity is 690\u00a0kg for a total for the combination of 1.5 tonnes and a total weight of the trailer of 1890\u00a0kg. At 155\u00a0cm, the trailer was somewhat narrower than the main vehicle, and higher at 133\u00a0cm. It increased the length of the combination to 6.9 metres. The trailer also carried a Vulcano fuel pump and stowage boxes for lubrication oil, greases, water and assorted equipment to serve the tank maintenance teams.  The Lorraine 37Ls were painted in the standard army green, a rather greyish colour, over which a brown pattern of dark earth was sprayed.  Tactical function and operational history In 1939, the Lorraine 37 L was gradually introduced to the supply units of the tank battalions. This coincided with a change in tactical thinking about the use of armour. In the early thirties, French doctrine had favoured the construction of ever deeper defensive belts to counter infantry infiltration tactics to defeat enemy attacks before they could develop into full-scale manoeuvre warfare, a field at which the French were aware being less adept than their most likely adversary, Germany. Expecting any possible enemy to defend himself likewise, the armour branch of the French Infantry became much preoccupied with the vexing problem of how to break through similar in-depth positions itself, emphasizing close cooperation with the foot soldier. Far less attention was paid to the next phase: the envelopment of the enemy forces.  The situation changed in the late thirties. Having at last built a considerable number of modern and well-armoured tanks, the Infantry became confident in its ability to break the enemy line, if sufficient artillery and air support was provided within a combined arms tactic. At the same time the political situation made it likely that large-scale offensives were needed to bring Germany to its knees. Though few officers advocated the creation of armoured divisions able to execute both the breakthrough and the strategic exploitation phase \u2014 these required trained personnel in numbers that simply would not be available \u2014 it was understood that the \"manoeuvre mass\" of tanks effecting the break would immediately have to envelop the defensive enemy position and defeat counterattacking enemy armour reserves, otherwise the momentum of the attack would be lost and the breach would not be kept open long enough for the motorised divisions and cavalry armoured divisions to be launched to quickly occupy and hold strategic key positions.  However, this posed a serious logistical problem: trucks would not be able to closely follow the tanks on the battlefield. The prescribed procedure for resupplying was for the tanks to return to their start positions to be refitted. While this had still been practical in the previous war with its much slower tempo of operations, it was unacceptable in modern warfare. The tanks would have to be supplied in the field to continue their advance as soon as possible. Thus a tracked supply vehicle was needed that could overcome the expected poor terrain conditions, with many shell-craters and trenches, and it had to be armoured to protect against shell-fragments, given that the breakthrough sector would likely be in range of concentrated enemy artillery.  The type was provided to the armoured units of both the Infantry and the Cavalry. Each independent tank battalion of the Infantry, or , had an organic strength of twelve Lorraine tractors: four in the  (supply platoon) of each of its three companies. The BCCs incorporated in the armoured divisions and equipped with the Char B1 or Char B1 bis had 27 TRC 37Ls: each of their three companies had six tractors in its supply platoon and furthermore a single tractor organic to each of its three tank platoons. This extra allotment was made to compensate for the large fuel consumption of these heavy tanks, that, apart from being simply bigger, had also a rather limited range. Each group of three tanks was in their case thus directly followed by its own fuel supply.  When, during the Battle of France, independent companies were formed, these, too, had their Lorraine tractors \u2014 an increased allotment of eight if a Char B1 bis unit, otherwise the standard allotment of four. However, the older FT 17 battalions only used fuel trucks. Likewise, the TRC 37L was not in common use in the colonies; however, when the 67e BCC, which was equipped with the Char D1, was brought over from Tunisia in June, it was provided with tractors. The motorised infantry divisions did not use the TRC 37L.  In the Cavalry, each squadron of twenty tanks had three Lorraine tractors, for a total of 24 for each mechanised light division. The AMR 35 or Panhard 178 units did not use the type, just trucks as its speed was considered insufficient. It was proposed to remedy this by fitting a stronger engine, bringing the speed to 50\u00a0km/h. The TRC 37L was also not present in the cavalry light divisions.  In practice, the supply vehicles would mainly move by road and meet with the tanks at predetermined rendez-vous points. Refuelling was relatively quick as the Vulcano could theoretically pump 565 litres in fifteen minutes. To completely refill a heavy tank would normally take about forty to sixty minutes. The trailer fuel reservoirs could themselves be replenished by the company fuel truck carrying 3600 litres of petrol. The company supplies could again be restocked from battalion stocks, moved by trucks loaded with fifty litre fuel drums. This method of distribution ensured a sufficient fuel supply on the tactical level, but was too cumbersome for strategic movements: if large distances had to be covered on track, the tanks would be directly refuelled from fuel trucks.  When the Germans invaded on 10 May, French tank units had an organic strength of 606 Lorraine 37Ls; the numbers produced were thus insufficient to provide each unit with its official complement. About a third had to do without. That day French general headquarters decided to increase the TRC 37L strength of  and  by a half; these armoured divisions had been earmarked as reserves against an expected German breakthrough attempt in the Gembloux Gap and the low range of the Char B1 bis worried French command. To free enough tractors, , still in the process of being constituted, had to give up its twelve TRC L37s to . However, contrary to French expectations, the main German breakthrough would be at Sedan and  was sent to block it \u2014 and despite its larger number of fuel tractors,  was still surprised by  while refuelling on 15 May.  During the campaign, the TRC 37L crews quickly saw the need for some armament and began to improvise machine-gun mounts on their vehicles.  Variants  The first development from the TRC 37L was an armoured personnel carrier, the  (\"Armoured mounted infantry vehicle 38L\"). Like the TRC 37L, this Lorraine 38L was equipped with an armoured tracked trailer. The total capacity was twelve men: the driver and one passenger in the driving compartment, four in the former cargo bay, and six in the trailer. To protect the infantry squad, high box-like armoured superstructures were built over both the bin and the trailer, with doors at their back. The loaded weight of the main vehicle was 7.7 tonnes. A total of 240 VBCP 38L vehicles were ordered, of which nine had been delivered on 1 September 1939 and around 150 by 25 June 1940. In view of the war threat, the order was made before the prototype could be tested. Of all participants in the Battle of France, the French army would thus be the only to employ a fully tracked APC. The vehicles were intended for the , the (single) mechanised infantry battalion within the , or armoured division of the Infantry. However, on 10 May, they had not yet been allocated to these units, who still used half-tracks. During May, the vehicles were hurriedly taken into use by the 5e BCP and 17e BCP of the 1re DCr and 2nd DCr respectively. The 4e DCr did not receive any.  An improved model, the VBCP 39L, was created by expanding the cargo bay to carry eight passengers, apart from the two crew members. This model had no trailer and a total capacity of ten persons; extra room was found by raising the upper deck \u2014 the passenger compartment was open-topped \u2014 and constructing a more forward sloped armour glacis, contiguous with the nose section; the type thus resembled postwar APCs. Some two hundred VBCP 39L vehicles were ordered, to replace the 38L on the production lines from the 241st vehicle onwards, but none had been delivered by June 1940, the manufacture remaining limited to a single prototype. Experimental and limited production models included tank destroyers armed with 47\u00a0mm SA 47 guns () and command post vehicles; probably a  prototype was produced.  Vichy production  In 1939 and 1940 the type had been mainly produced in the Lorraine factory at Lun\u00e9ville. Early 1939 it was decided to erect a factory in a more southern location, less vulnerable to German bombing, at Bagn\u00e8res-de-Bigorre. This  had not made a single vehicle by the time of the armistice between France and Germany, but it was, like the other tractor-producing Fouga factory at B\u00e9ziers, located in the unoccupied zone of Vichy France. Limited production continued after June 1940 for a total of about 150, although military models were not officially produced. Some of these vehicles had a shortened chassis, their suspension consisting of only two bogies per side. Lorraine tractors were ostensively fitted for use in forestry and construction; in reality they constituted a clandestine armoured fighting vehicle production as they could be easily rebuilt. The AMX factory secretly produced armoured bodies for these vehicles, which were stockpiled. The type was called the . After the German occupation of the south of France in November 1942, many of these chassis were hidden. In the spring of 1944, the French resistance attacked the Bagn\u00e8res factory on orders from London, the allies assuming that it produced vehicles for Germany. To prevent further attacks, the resistance was informed of and involved in the affair in the summer of 1944 by the promise to arm existing vehicles for their use. The first twenty of these were delivered in January 1945, after the liberation, and the factory continued modifying vehicles for the duration of the war at a rate of about twenty a month, often by fitting an armoured superstructure, armed with a light or heavy machine-gun, to the front or back of the chassis.  German use A considerable number of Lorraine tractors, about 360, fell into German hands. Due to its reliability, the type was well suited to the mobile tactics the Germans favoured in 1941 and 1942. They were first used as such, renamed the . As the Germans themselves had not produced a similar type, the Lorraine tractors filled a requirement for fully tracked supply vehicles as  or . In July and August 1942, Major Alfred Becker directed the conversion of 170 of these vehicles into the  or Marder I, a 75\u00a0mm equipped self-propelled anti-tank gun. At the same time, 106 were converted into self-propelled artillery: 94 into the  and twelve into the . Also, an artillery observation vehicle was provided: the , thirty of which were produced. A single conversion entailed the fitting of a Soviet 122\u00a0mm howitzer: the .  The Germans also employed the VBCP 38L as the Lorraine 38L(f).  For a time, it has also been assumed that a 47\u00a0mm tank destroyer conversion existed: the presumed \"4.7cm Pak181(f) auf PanzerJ\u00e4ger Lorraine Schlepper (f)\", based on preserved photographs that, however, in reality depicted the French  mentioned above, an ad hoc conversion built in June 1940.

Gallery  After the war Lorraine tractors were used after World War II for various experimental roles. A number were sold on the civilian market, being used to carry cranes and digging equipment. However, the factory did not secure, despite lobbying, an order from the French Army, due to the fact that so much discarded Allied mat\u00e9riel could be obtained for free. Likewise, an attempt in 1946 to export the type to Switzerland failed. Some were listed in the army inventories for a few years after the war; the last known user was Syria. The Maurice Dufresne Museum, in Azay-le-Rideau, and the State Military Technical Museum, at Ivanovskoje, exhibit surviving vehicles of the shortened version.

In 1938, the French Air Ministry issued a specification for a three-seat twin-engine bomber, with a capacity of 800 kg (1,7655 lb) of bombs, a maximum speed of 400 km/h (250 mph) and a range of 2,000 km (1,243 mi). The new aircraft was to be a replacement for the Bloch 174 and the Amiot 143, both of which were becoming obsolete. To meet this requirement, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s Anonymes Lorraine, based at Nancy, developed the Lorraine 37L. This aircraft was a further development of the Lorraine 37, and was a monoplane of all-metal construction, with a crew of three. The prototype, powered by two 471 hp (347 kW) Lorraine 12 G Er narcissus/12 G Esso engines, flew in 1939. A total of 38 Lorraine 37L aircraft were delivered to the French Air Force, with the type being used for close support duties during the German invasion of France in 1940. A further 20 aircraft were delivered to the Belgian Air Force, while an additional 25 were built for the Royal Air Force as the Blenheim Mark IV. Lorraine 37L bombers were also used for experimental purposes. During the German offensive, several were used as \"pathfinders\" for the heavier bombers, such as the Amiot 140.

Steele, which feature the landscape of Brown County, Indiana. The paintings are located on the Eskenazi Health campus, near downtown Indianapolis, Indiana, and are part of the Eskenazi Health Art Collection.  Description  Four Seasons is a series of four oil on canvas murals - Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter - painted in 1914 by Indiana artist T.C. Steele, which feature the landscape of Brown County, Indiana. Often regarded as the \"pioneer of Indiana landscape paintings,\" Steele, in his signature \"agreeable impressionistic style,\" used color, light, and brushwork to capture the experience of each season in southern Indiana. In 1917, Alfred M. Brooks, in his article \"The Art and Work of Theodore Steele,\" featured in The American Magazine of Art, wrote that the Four Seasons murals feature \"...lovely echoes of light and shade, made to play over, and to accentuate, rather than conceal, the highly representative character of the details which make up the purely pictorial nature of the subjects, these 'Seasons' are masterly and, decoratively masterful. They bespeak the inherent bigness and breadth of the scenes they represent so faithfully.\"  Historical information   The Four Seasons murals were created as part of the 1914 City Hospital Mural Project in Indianapolis, Indiana. In 1911, Indianapolis City Hospital expanded by adding two dedicated patient buildings, the Burdsal Units. St. Margaret\u2019s Hospital Guild, a local women\u2019s volunteer group dedicated to supporting the City Hospital, donated money for decoration of the new wards, which resulted in the world's first large-scale mural project in a public hospital. Sixteen of Indiana\u2019s \u201cfinest and most promising\u201d artists, including Steele, were invited to contribute to the mural project. Despite the limited budget, Steele and the other artists committed to completing the project for the wages of a union house painter, approximately $75\u2013100 per month.  While the majority of artists worked on-site at the hospital, Steele painted the Four Seasons murals at his home, \"The House of the Singing Winds,\" in Brown County, Indiana. Because the canvases and frameworks were so large, and his existing studio could not accommodate the space required, Steele painted the murals in his living room. In late 1914, before they were installed in the hospital, the Four Seasons murals were exhibited at the Herron Art Institute. Upon arrival at City Hospital, the four canvases were mounted to patient ward walls using a mixture of white lead and damar varnish. Once hung, the adhesive was further secured by covering the completed murals with thick layers of varnish.  Conservation  In 1967, imminent renovation plans for the Burdsal units endangered the mural collection. Through a campaign organized by St. Margaret's Hospital Guild, Steele's murals were slated for conservation by the James G. Snodgrass Studio. The four murals were removed from the building's walls, mounted to masonite, restored, and displayed at the Indiana State Museum. With building renovations complete, in 1976, three of Steele's murals - Spring, Summer, and Autumn - were returned to the hospital, where they hung in conference rooms. The fourth mural, Winter, was gifted to the museum as a gesture of gratitude for the works' safekeeping.  Location  The Four Seasons mural fragments were reunited with the 2013 opening of a new Sidney and Lois Eskenazi Hospital campus and are part of the Eskenazi Health Art Collection. Winter is on loan for 99 years from the Indiana State Museum. The Four Seasons mural fragments are located in The Rapp Family Conference Center: Steele Corridor on the first floor of the Sidney & Lois Eskenazi Hospital and are \"Dedicated with gratitude, The Penrod Society.\u201d  Artist   Theodore Clement Steele (1847-1926) was an Impressionist painter known for his portraits and Indiana landscape paintings. Born and raised in Indiana, he studied at the Royal Academy when he and his family moved to Munich in 1879. Steele returned to Indiana in 1885 and was part of a group of well-known Indiana artists, the Hoosier Group. Among others, Steele\u2019s work is included at the Haan Mansion Museum of Indiana Art, Indiana State Museum, Indianapolis Museum of Art, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and the Indiana University Art Museum in Bloomington, Indiana.

Bowning is a small village on the Lachlan River in New South Wales, Australia. It is located on the Hume Highway (Federal Highway) between Sydney and Melbourne. In the early days of European settlement, Bowning was on the boundary of two rival land grants, one granted to John Macarthur and the other to his great rival, William Charles Wentworth. The portion of the Main Western railway line between Blackheath and Bowning was built as part of the Great Western Railway, which was opened in 1863 to provide a faster route between Sydney and Bathurst. The line passed close to Bowning, but the railway station there was not built until 25 October 1892. It was on a loop line that ran north from the main line towards Young, although it never proceeded further than Bowning. The station was designed by John Whitton in the style of an Indian bungalow, a popular style for Australian railway stations at the time. The main platform was on the loop line, with a goods siding on the main line. A small station building and signal box were constructed at the same time. The station was closed in the early 1980s. The disused railway station and the nearby bridge over the Lachlan River were placed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register in 1999. In 2013, the station was sold to a private owner. It was subsequently sold to the Upper Lachlan Shire Council, and is used as a museum and art gallery.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 23908652}

Opportunity Scholarship Program provides scholarships to low-income children in Washington D.C. for tuition and other fees at participating private schools. The program was the first Federally funded school voucher program in the United States. It was first approved in 2003 and allowed to expire for the first time in 2009 under the Obama administration. The program was reauthorized under the SOAR Act in 2011, but again defunded at the end of the second Obama presidency.  The program was reinstated under President Trump.  Background In 2004, President George W. Bush signed the D.C. School Choice Incentive Act of 2003, creating the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program to provide scholarships to students from low-income families to attend a private school of choice. The program targeted 2,000 children from low-income families in Washington D.C. These children were given funding to help offset the cost of private schooling. In 2008, the program funded attendance at 54 D.C. private schools for students from families with an average income of $22,736, \"or about 107 percent of the federal poverty level for a family of four.\"  In 2009 the program faced a phase out with President Barack Obama's 2009 budget proposal cutting all funding for the program and including language to prohibit any new students from receiving scholarships.  In 2011, Speaker of the House John Boehner and Senator Joe Lieberman introduced the Scholarships for Opportunity and Results (SOAR) Act to restore funding for the program and again allow new students to participate. The entirety of the SOAR Act was included in the 2011 long-term continuing resolution, the passage of which resulted in a five-year reauthorization of the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program. The 2004 legislation had permitted students to receive scholarships of up to $7,500, whereas the 2011 bill provides scholarships of up to $8,000 for students in kindergarten through eighth grade and up to $12,000 for students in grades 9-12.  In February 2012, President Barack Obama announced his budget proposal for 2013, which did not include new funding for the program. According to ABC News, the budget stated that the program's budget for 2012 had enough money to also cover students' vouchers in 2013, but did not mention future years. The lack of funding was criticized by conservatives, including The Heritage Foundation and The Wall Street Journal columnist Jason L. Riley, who argued that the program costs less per child and has a higher graduation rate than public schools in Washington D.C.  Program Administrator  Between 2004 and 2010, the Washington Scholarship Fund, a nonprofit group, administered the program, which was funded at $12 million a year.  As of May 2010, the D.C. Children and Youth Investment Trust Corporation is serving as the administrator of the  D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program. The program is appropriated to receive $20 million per year,  beginning in the 2012-13 school year.  On April 22, 2016, board members of the D.C. Children and Youth Investment Trust Corporation voted to dissolve the organization because of debt caused by large staff costs, including misuse of the organization's credit cards. By cutting employees' salaries, abandoning its office lease, and cutting other costs, the organization will try to deliver some of the promised grant funding in 2016.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Vulcano\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Vulcano () or Vulcan is a small volcanic island  belonging to Italy in the Tyrrhenian Sea, about  north of Sicily and located at the southernmost end of the seven Aeolian Islands. The island is  in area, rises to  above sea level, and it contains several volcanic calderas, including one of the four active volcanoes in Italy that are not submarine.  The word \"volcano\", and its equivalent in several European languages, derives from the name of this island, which derives from the Roman belief that the tiny island was the chimney of  Vulcan, the Roman god of fire. In November 2021, 150 people were evacuated from the island's harbour area due to increased volcanic activity and gases; an amber alert had been issued in October 2021 after several significant changes in the volcano's parameters.  History   The Romans used the island mainly for raw materials, harvesting timber, and mining alum and sulfur. These were the principal activities on the island until the end of the nineteenth century.  After Bourbon rule collapsed in 1860, the Scottish industrialist and philanthropist James Stevenson bought the northern part of the island. He then built a villa, reopened the local mines, and planted vineyards for making Malmsey wine. Stevenson lived on Vulcano until the last major eruption on the island, in 1888. This eruption lasted the better part of two years, by which time Stevenson had sold all of his property to the local populace. He never returned to the island. His villa is still intact.  Geology  Volcanic activity in the region is largely the result of tectonic activity,  the northward-moving African plate meeting the Eurasian plate. There are three volcanic centres on the island:   At the southern end of the island are old stratovolcano cones, Monte Aria (), Monte Saraceno (), and Monte Luccia (), which have partially collapsed into the Il Piano Caldera.  The most recently active centre is the Gran Cratere at the top of the Fossa cone, the cone having grown in the Lentia Caldera in the middle of the island, and has had at least nine major eruptions in the last 6,000 years.  At the north of the island is the islet, Vulcanello (), connected to Vulcano by an isthmus that may be flooded in bad weather. It emerged from the sea during an eruption in 183 BCE, as a separate islet. Occasional eruptions from its three cones with both pyroclastic flow deposits and lavas occurred from then until 1550, with the last eruption creating a narrow isthmus connecting it to Vulcano.  Vulcano has been quiet since the eruption of the Fossa cone on 2 August 1888 to 22 March 1890, which deposited about  of pyroclastic material on the summit. The style of eruption seen on the Fossa cone is called a Vulcanian eruption, being the explosive emission of pyroclastic fragments of viscous magmas caused by the high viscosity preventing gases from escaping easily. This eruption of Vulcano was carefully documented at the time by Giuseppe Mercalli. Mercalli described the eruptions as \"...explosions sounding like a cannon at irregular intervals...\" As a result, vulcanian eruptions are based on his description. A typical vulcanian eruption can hurl blocks of solid material several hundreds of metres from the vent. Mercalli reported that blocks from the 1888\u20131890 eruption fell into the sea between Vulcano and neighboring Lipari, and several that had fallen on the island of Vulcano were photographed by him or his assistants.   Volcanic gas emissions from this volcano are measured by a multicomponent gas analyzer system, which detects degassing of rising magmas before an eruption, improving prediction of volcanic activity.  A survey on local groundwater from 1995 to 1997 found temperatures of 49\u201375\u00a0\u00b0C, sodium sulfate-chloride chemical composition, and near neutral pH in the water wells closest to the slopes of the volcanic cone. This is mainly due to condensation onto the slopes of the volcanic cone and water-rock interaction buffering.  Population At the 2011 Census, Vulcano had a population of 953 residents, living in three localities \u2013 Vulcano Porto, Vulcano Piano and Vulcanello.  Biology Since Vulcano island has volcanic activity, it is a place where thermophiles and hyperthermophiles are likely to be found. In fact, the hyperthermophilic archaean Pyrococcus furiosus was described for the first time when it was isolated from sediments of this island by Gerhard Fiala and Karl Stetter.  Mythology  The Ancient Greeks named this island Theras\u00eda (\u0398\u03b7\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u03b1) and Th\u00e9rmessa (\u0398\u03ad\u03c1\u03bc\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1, source of heat). The island appeared in their myths as the private foundry of the Olympian god Hephaestus, the patron of blacksmiths. Their myths noted two more of his foundries, at Etna and Olympus. Strabo also mentions Thermessa as sacred place of Hephaestus (\u1f31\u03b5\u03c1\u1f70 \u1f29\u03c6\u03b1\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5), but it is not certain whether this was a third name for the island, or merely an adjective.  Similarly, the Romans believed that Vulcano was the chimney of their god Vulcan's workshop and, therefore, named the island after him. According to the Roman myths, the island had grown due to his periodic clearing of cinders and ashes from his forge. They also explained earthquakes that either preceded or accompanied the explosions of ash as being due to Vulcan making weapons for their god Mars for his armies to wage war.  First historical ascent and reception in medieval literature The first ascent of the volcanic cone is documented for the 13th century. The Dominican monk Burchard of Mount Sion, in his pilgrimage report to the Holy Land, tells of his return journey via Sicily, which probably took place in 1284. On Vulcano he had climbed the summit \"crawling on his hands and feet\". His ascent can be considered authentic, as he reports in detail on his observations of the landscape and nature, for example describing the fumaroles or the diameter of the crater.  The island of Vulcano as well as the Aeolian Islands are already known to Isidor of Seville, the Gallic bishop Arculf, who dictated his journey to the Holy Land to the Irishman Adomnan (before 680), or Bartholomew Anglicus. They are an integral part of medieval knowledge of the geography of the Mediterranean, but none of them wrote about Vulcano on their own initiative.  Vulcano is also mentioned in the pilgrimage report (ca. 1350) by Ludolf von Sudheim, who, however, claims that he did not dare to climb it. Unlike Burchard of Mount Sion, Ludolf expected to find the entrance to hell at the crater. The Proven\u00e7al knight Antoine de La Sale tells of an excursion to the island in 1406. His text is a didactic textbook for his pupil John of Calabria, the son of Duke Rene I of Anjou.  Appearances in contemporary culture The film Vulcano (released in the U.S. as Volcano) was filmed on Vulcano and the nearby island of Salina between 1949 and 1950.  An asteroid is named for this island, 4464 Vulcano.  The island of Vulcano is featured in the Battle Tendency story arc of the manga JoJo's Bizarre Adventure by Hirohiko Araki, as the scene of the final clash between the protagonist Joseph Joestar and the antagonist Kars, leader of the Pillar Men.  The American attorney and writer, Richard Paul Roe, asserts that the play The Tempest by William Shakespeare is set on the island of Vulcano, rather than the more authoritative interpretation that the setting was based on reports about Bermuda in the Americas and a hurricane encountered there.  The island is referred to by a hologram of Leonardo da Vinci in the Star Trek: Voyager episode \"Concerning Flight\" while speaking to Tuvok, an alien from a planet named Vulcan.

His name may be related to that of the island of Vulcano in the Aeolian Islands, one of the Lipari Islands off the northeast coast of Sicily, Italy, which is still active and is the location of the main crater of the Aeolian volcano. Vulcan was the son of the god Cronus and the mortal woman Rhea. He had three brothers and three sisters, and was the brother of Ceres, Vesta, Neptune, Pluto, Proserpine, and Fortune. When he was born, his father Cronus, who had learned that one of his children was fated to dethrone him, swallowed his children as soon as they were born. But Rhea did not want this to happen to her last-born child, Vulcan, and substituted a large stone wrapped in swaddling clothes for Cronus to swallow. The real Vulcan was hidden in a cave on the island of Vulcano by his mother. According to a different tradition, the young child was placed in an iron box which his mother then threw into the sea. He was rescued by a fish that lived in the sea around the island of Vulcano, a fish that was later caught by a fisherman, and the child was then raised by the fisherman and his wife. As an adult, Vulcan became a metalsmith and worked at his forge. He was the first to discover how to extract metal from rocks, and he invented the hammer and anvil. He made many useful implements, including weapons, tools, and household items. He was also a sculptor and created many beautiful works of art. In some traditions, Vulcan was said to have created the first wife of each of his brothers. For example, he created the first woman for the god Mars, and she was named Salacia. He also created the first woman for the god Neptune, and she was named Venilia. And he created the first woman for the god Pluto, and she was named Proserpina. Vulcan is often shown as a bearded man with a hammer, anvil, and tongs. He is also sometimes shown as a man with a hammer and anvil, and with a bird (usually a cockerel) on his shoulder. The Romans celebrated the festival of Vulcania on August 23. The festival was held in honor of the god Vulcan, and it included a sacrifice to him. The sacrifice was performed on a mountaintop, and the meat from the sacrifice was then boiled in a large pot called a Volcanus. The festival also included a race in which the competitors carried red-hot stones in iron baskets. The winner of the race was the competitor who carried the hottest stone. The goddess Vesta was also honored during the festival of Vulcania. Vesta was the goddess of the hearth, and she was said to preside over the family and home. Her symbol was a burning candle, and her temple was located in the Forum in Rome. The island of Vulcano in the Aeolian Islands was said to be the home of the god Vulcan. The island is still active, and the main crater of the Aeolian volcano is located there.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Casablanca (novella)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Casablanca is a novella written by Edgar Brau in Nevada, United States, in November\u2013December 2002. In the story, set in Buenos Aires Province, Argentina, a rich Argentine ranch owner builds a replica of Rick's Caf\u00e9 Am\u00e9ricain on his estate, with the idea of reproducing in it, by means of doubles, the most important scenes of the movie  Casablanca.  Plot summary Casablanca begins when the narrator, who is driving his car to Mar del Plata seaside resort, is caught by a big storm. While looking for some shelter he comes across a place similar to Rick's Caf\u00e9 Am\u00e9ricain. He gets out of the car and, almost blinded by the rain, hurries to the entrance door. Just then somebody starts playing \"As Time Goes By\"  on a piano at the back of the room. The player is identical to Sam, but much older; he is wearing the same suit jacket that is shown in the film, but worn out now. In one of the corners, an old man in dark glasses, who looks like Humphrey Bogart, is dozing at a table. When the song is over, the black man starts to tell the narrator the story of the place and of the people who lived there.  It all started, he says, in the early fifties, when the owner of those lands, a rich man very similar to  Sydney Greenstreet \u2014the actor who interpreted se\u00f1or Ferrari\u2014 decides to build a replica of Rick's caf\u00e9 to reproduce in it the main scenes of the movie. With this purpose, he sends agents around the country and abroad, to look for people whose physical appearance is identical to the characters. He keeps for himself the role of Se\u00f1or Ferrari. When the cast is ready, they rehearse for some months; their voices and accents must sound like the English spoken in the original version. To imitate the black-and-white movie, everything in the place is in lighter or darker shades of grey.  When the caf\u00e9 is opened, success is enormous. The people who visit it have the feeling they are \u201cinside\u201d the famous movie. Se\u00f1or Ferrari's dream (\u201cFerrari\u201d is the name given to the ranch owner in the story) Se\u00f1or Ferrari's dream of turning the movie Casablanca into reality has come true.  Some years of splendor follow, but an epidemic of hoof-and-mouth disease and an unexpected flood affect Se\u00f1or Ferrari's property, and he goes bankrupt. He speaks with President Per\u00f3n to get a license to play for real money at the roulette wheel and the poker tables (up to that moment people pretended that they were gambling). President Per\u00f3n \u2014who had visited the place some months before and had an affair with Ilsa (Ferrari's lover) \u2014 agrees to it.  The caf\u00e9 manages to survive, although far from its past magnificence. Then a military coup overthrows Per\u00f3n, and the casino is closed. It is a hard blow for Ferrari, who commits suicide. In his will, he states that the caf\u00e9 will remain the property of his employees, provided that they never shut it down or put it up for sale.  In the following weeks, they try to do their best to make ends meet, but after a while, some of them give up and desert the place. In a few months, the only ones who remain are Rick, Ilsa, Sam, Renault, and Ugarte. To make a living they decide to perform isolated scenes, which are shown to the few tourists who happen to go by.  Time passes, and not only the place deteriorates but the health of its dwellers as well. The moment the narrator arrives, Sam can offer nothing but an account of what happened in that fantastic Casablanca, and introduce Rick and Ilsa, who are much older now (Rick is blind; Ilsa makes a brief appearance, dressed as Ingrid Bergman in one of the scenes of the movie). In a vase placed near the exit door, visitors leave a few coins.  Meanwhile, the storm has subsided.  Sam plays \"As Time Goes By\" once again, to say goodbye now. The narrator gets into his car and, with the feeling that he has witnessed a sequel to the movie that Hollywood never made, leaves the place.  Background In 2002 Edgar Brau was invited by the University of Nevada, Reno, as visiting professor and writer-in-residence for the fall 2002 \u2013 spring 2003. As writer-in-residence he had to write a work of fiction during his stay. He had been considering the possibility of writing a fantastic narration (in the line of his The Poem or The Buddha's Eyes) that would be a tribute to his father's movie-theater, where he had spent his childhood years. As he said:  \u201cI started Casablanca with the idea of writing a fantastic story that would pay tribute to my father's cinema, where I spent my early years. I wanted that cinema, the building itself, to be very much present in the work. But I soon realized that the narration was leading somewhere else, and as one must never go against the way a story unfolds, I decided to put off that homage for another occasion. Later on I will do it, and with a fantastic story, as I said\u201d.  So, the novella developed a realistic tone and it had little to do with that cinema of his childhood. It was written in November\u2013December 2002, in Reno, and corrected in February 2003 at Lake Tahoe.  Main characters Se\u00f1or Ferrari A rich Argentine ranch owner, who offers all his possessions to his admired Ingrid Bergman as long as she marries him. His proposal is rejected, so he decides to create his own Casablanca on his estate, and to play the role of Se\u00f1or Ferrari.  Sam He is from Uruguay. He was working as a bellhop at a hotel in the City of Buenos Aires when Se\u00f1or Ferrari came across him. He's the true narrator in the novella.  Rick Argentinean, a former high school literature teacher. He's very fond of French authors and given to drinking. When the novella starts he is over eighty years old and blind.  Ilsa Australian. She earned her living as a trapeze artist at an American circus. On a Brazil tour she was hired by one of Se\u00f1or Ferrari's agents to work as Ingrid Bergman's double. Foul mouthed and energetic, she becomes Ferrari's mistress and prot\u00e9g\u00e9e. In the story, Sam calls her \u201cElsa\u201d.  Ugarte Before being hired by Se\u00f1or Ferrari, he sang tangos at a strip-tease night club in the City of Buenos Aires.  Fortunato A homeless child adopted by Ilsa and Sam when he was a few months old. In the story he is around ten. Although he does not know the language, he reads French books to Rick.  The Narrator Nothing is said about his age, physical appearance or profession.  Theme  The novella Casablanca is a perfect metaphor of Argentina. In the story, the Argentine Casablanca is a copy of the famous movie; in real life, Argentina was built as a copy of certain European countries, a copy, so to say, that \u201cEuropeans in exile\u201d (as Borges defined himself and Argentines) made of a movie entitled \u201cEurope\u201d.  The splendor of the Argentine Casablanca was weakened, at first, by certain natural disasters, and later on by catastrophical political events; the splendor of Argentina, was eroded mainly by those unfortunate political events. Among them (and as a parallel between real life and fiction which Brau's work reflects perfectly), are the military coups that shook the nation in the period 1930-1980.  In the novella, the coup d\u00b4\u00e9tat which overthrew President Per\u00f3n in 1955 was the beginning of the end for Ferrari's fabulous work, for his Casablanca \u2014which had already been \u201churt\u201d by the flood and the hoof-and-mouth disease\u2014. In real life, the beginning of the end for that other \u201cCasablanca\u201d, Argentina, took place some years earlier, in 1930 (when Jos\u00e9 F\u00e9lix Uriburu led a military coup against President Hip\u00f3lito Yrigoyen), and the signs of decadence were revealed more slowly.  The novella has an open ending. The same thing sometimes happens in real life.  Translation into English The translation of Casablanca by Andrea G. Labinger was finalist in 2007 Pen USA Literary Award in the category of Translation.

The story takes place in the near future, in a post-apocalyptic world where most of the world's major cities have been destroyed by nuclear war, including the title city of Casablanca. In the story, a man from a rural village goes to the city in search of a doctor for his dying wife, and finds the city in ruins, and full of dangerous, deranged inhabitants. He eventually finds a doctor, who agrees to come back to the village with him to treat his wife. But the doctor is killed on the way out of the city, and the man is forced to leave him there. He returns to the village, and his wife dies soon after. The story is told in the first person, and is a good example of the \"hard\" science fiction style of writing.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"ITF World Champions\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The International Tennis Federation (ITF) designates a World Champion each year based on performances throughout the year, emphasising the Grand Slam tournaments, and also considering team events such as the Davis Cup and Fed Cup. Men's and women's singles champions were first named in 1978; the title is now also awarded for doubles, wheelchair, and junior players. It is sometimes named the \"ITF Player of the Year\" award, alluding to similar other year-end awards in tennis.  Rules and procedures The ITF's constitution states that no tennis tournament can be designated the \"World Championships\" without unanimous consent of the ITF Council. There is currently no such tournament. The constitution also states: The ITF may award the title of World Champion to players who, in the opinion of the Board of Directors, are the most outstanding players in any one-year. The names of players who have been awarded this title shall be listed in the Roll of Honour. It also states: Official Tennis Championships [i.e. the Grand Slam events] shall be the decisive factor in the determination of the ITF World Champions for each year.  For singles, ITF appoints a panel of former top players at the start of the season, which votes on the champion at the end of the season.  The boys' and girls' singles and doubles titles prior to 2003 were awarded based on world ranking. Since then singles and doubles rankings have been combined in a single award each for boys and for girls.  The world champion accolade has been extended by the ITF to wheelchair tennis players of the Men's and Women's division since 1991. In November 2017, the ITF announced that the quad wheelchair tennis division is to be recognised in its annual list of ITF World Champions.  In 1996, the Philippe Chatrier Award was introduced, honouring individuals or organisations who have made outstanding contributions to tennis globally, both on and off the court. The award is considered to be the ITF's highest accolade and is named after the former French tennis player Philippe Chatrier, who was President of the governing body between 1977 and 1991.  The ITF World Champions' Dinner takes place in Paris during the French Open, to honour the previous year's champions, who are presented with a trophy, but not any monetary prize.  For 2020 there were no ITF World Champion awards given due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The tennis season was suspended for about 5 months for both the female and the male tennis players.  Men's singles The first men's panel in 1978 had three members, Don Budge, Fred Perry, and Lew Hoad, who attended the season's Grand Slam events at ITF expense to inform their choice. The 1983 panel split two to one between John McEnroe (votes of Budge and Perry) and Mats Wilander (vote of Hoad). The 1984 panel had five members, while the 1985 panel had four: Budge, Perry, Hoad, and Tony Trabert. When Ivan Lendl was chosen as champion for 1985, the panel's announcement was accompanied with a rebuke for Lendl's criticism of some tournaments and his refusal to play in the Davis Cup. Perry and Trabert were on the 1986 panel, with performances outside the Grand Slams taken into consideration.  The 1990 designation of Lendl as champion was a surprise.  That year, the Association of Tennis Professionals named Stefan Edberg its \"Player of The Year\", in accordance with the ATP Rankings, while Tennis Magazine (France) ranked Edberg first, Andre Agassi second, and Lendl third. Tennis also suggested the ITF was punishing Edberg for denigrating the Grand Slam Cup tournament it had introduced. The ITF panel, of Perry, Trabert, and Frank Sedgman, called it \"the toughest decision any of us can remember having to make\", and stated it was Lendl's better average performance in the Grand Slams that made the difference.  The choice to award Djokovic the ITF World Champion of 2013 over Nadal was unexpected. Nadal finished the year ranked #1 and with more slams (2 to 1), more Masters titles (5 to 3), and more tournament titles (10 to 7).  Similar to the situation with Edberg in 1990, the ITF cited Nadal's failure to win a match at 2 of the 4 slams (DNP the Australian Open, 1st round loss at Wimbledon) to justify their decision and Djokovic's consistent results across all four Slams (1 title, 2 runner-ups, 1 SF), Davis Cup (led Serbia to final, won 7/7 singles rubbers) and the ATP World Tour Finals (won title).  Other instances when the ITF choices differed from the ATP rankings are 1978 (Jimmy Connors), 1982 (McEnroe), 1989 (Lendl).   None of these, however, were controversial and were generally agreed upon, with the 1978 and 1982 choices being particularly clear cut in favor of Borg (1978) and Connors (1982).  Women's singles The women's panel initially featured three former women's champions, Margaret Court, Margaret duPont and Ann Jones. Althea Gibson was a member through the early 1980s.  ITF world champions for women differed from the WTA year-end rankings the following years: 1978 (Martina Navratilova), 1994 (Steffi Graf), 2001 (Lindsay Davenport), 2004 (Lindsay Davenport), 2005 (Lindsay Davenport), 2011 (Caroline Wozniacki), 2012 (Victoria Azarenka), 2017 (Simona Halep).

The collection was issued after the death of lead singer Lester Chambers in October 2020. The Chambers Brothers' music was influenced by gospel music, blues, and R&B, and the group became known for their distinct, close harmonies, as well as guitarist George Chambers' innovative use of electronic effects. The group's debut album, People Get Ready, was released in 1966, and featured the single \"People Get Ready\", which became the group's first big hit.

It is on the line between D\u00fcsseldorf/Cologne and Dortmund. The 1848 reception building is one of the oldest of its kind. The station was originally Elberfeld station and has been renamed several times since. Since 1992, it has been called Wuppertal Hauptbahnhof. Wuppertal Hauptbahnhof is also the site of lost luggage operations for Deutsche Bahn.  History  On 3 September 1841, a few years after the opening of the first railway in Germany, the Dusseldorf-Elberfeld Railway Company (German: D\u00fcsseldorf-Elberfelder Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft, DEE) began operation of the D\u00fcsseldorf\u2013Elberfeld line from its D\u00fcsseldorf station to its Elberfeld station (now Wuppertal-Steinbeck station). It was the first steam-worked railway line in Western Germany and Prussia.  The Bergisch-M\u00e4rkische Railway Company (Bergisch-M\u00e4rkische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft, BME), opened its Elberfeld\u2013Dortmund railway from its Elberfeld station (known as D\u00f6ppersberg station) via Hagen to Dortmund to Schwelm on 9 October 1847. It was extended to Hagen and Dortmund on 20 December 1848. The BME took over the DEE in 1857.  The first provisional station building became inadequate within a few years. It was decided to build a new building, designed by Hauptner and Ebeling and opened in 1850 on a new section of line connecting the BME and DEE lines, which was completed on 9 March 1849. Around 1900, a protruding porch was built in front of the ground floor, which conflicted with the architectural design.  Nevertheless, this concept was maintained after its reconstruction after World War II.   This will only change with the completion of the current renovation of the station/D\u00f6ppersberg area.  The station has been renamed several times. It was first called Elberfeld, but a few years later it was renamed Elberfeld-D\u00f6ppersberg and before the First World War it was renamed Elberfeld Hauptbahnhof. In the early 1930s the station's name was changed to Wuppertal-Elberfeld station as a consequence of the merger of the towns of Elberfeld and Barmen as the city of Wuppertal. Finally in 1992, it was renamed Wuppertal Hauptbahnhof.  Station buildings The station building is located next to platform track 1 and is connected by a tunnel to tracks 2\u20135. Above the entrance, near the old Reichsbahn railway division of Elberfeld, there are four pillars supporting the roof. The building is connected by the 200-metre-long D\u00f6ppersberg pedestrian tunnel directly with central Elberfeld and the Wuppertal Hbf (D\u00f6ppersberg) Schwebebahn (monorail) station.  A McDonald's restaurant has been established in the premises of the former baggage check-in and in the tunnel under the entrance there a large newsagency/book shop and a bakery. The low building in front of the historic station building houses a pharmacy. In front of the entrance to the station there is a parking area, including a taxi stand, and nearby there is an Inter City Hotel.  Architecture The original building is one of the oldest big city railway stations in Germany. It is a three-storey ashlar building bounded by tower-like corner projections. The main entrance in the middle of the building is a four-columned portico, with emphasised Corinthian capitals and has strong antique ornamentation. The ground floor originally had arched openings and it has six rectangular windows on each level and on each side of the portico. It was necessary in 1900 to build a ground-floor entrance porch to cater for the growing need for space for counters and waiting rooms.  The station is part of an ensemble of buildings built in neoclassical style, which is grouped around the railway station forecourt. On the western side of the square is the headquarters of the former Reichsbahn railway division of Elberfeld; on the eastern side there used to be the headquarters of the Chief General Manager, but thus was torn down after the Second World War.  The construction of the station was accompanied by extensive urban development in the D\u00f6ppersberg area. The D\u00f6ppersberg bridge (D\u00f6ppersberger Br\u00fccke) was built to connect centre of old Elberfeld with the station over the Wupper.  Reconstruction since 2014 The entire area around the station has been extensively reconstructed, finishing in 2018. The main goal was to create a continuous pedestrian and shopping area connecting the station to the city centre, as is already the case in many other German cities, such as Cologne, Stuttgart or Hanover. The B\u00a07 which is a very busy arterial road, was relocated to a tunnel, while a pedestrian zone was built above it.   Preparations began in the summer of 2009, and the opening ceremony for work on the new, modernised station was held on 30 June 2009. Since the completion of the work in 2018, it has had a two-storey shopping level, a large station forecourt, which was built on the former Bahnhofstrasse, and a bridge and caf\u00e9 over the B\u00a07, which was lowered by about seven metres. A new bus station has replaced the bus stops that were previously on the B\u00a07. It was built above a 200-space car park next to the station. Instead of a glass cube\u2014which had previously been planned\u2014a striking building with a bronze-coloured facade was built, which contains a Primark branch.   The modernisation of the Deutsche Bahn entrance building at an expected cost of \u20ac12.4 million started in 2014. This modernisation was expected to be completed in 2016.   In the course of the renovation, bus services were temporarily relocated from the street of D\u00f6ppersberg to the districts of Ohligsm\u00fchle and Wall at the timetable change in July 2014. First D\u00f6ppersberg was lowered from the end of October 2012 and then the eastern part of the station lobby was demolished from the end of February 2013. The tenancies in this area\u2014pharmacy, pub, bank branch, bakery and fast food restaurant\u2014were terminated in autumn 2012 and they were closed. The DB Travel Center was temporarily located in a shipping container at the western end of platform 1.   The B\u00a07 was closed in July 2014 and the superstructure of the D\u00f6ppersberg bridge was removed in August 2014. The pedestrian tunnel ending there was closed in January 2015. Instead, a steel replacement pedestrian bridge crossed the B-7 construction site. This involved a 300-metre-long walk around the station building. The B\u00a07 was reopened to traffic in July 2017.   A computer-based interlocking was put into operation in the Wuppertal area at the end of August 2017. This involved the installation of 387 sets of signals, 98 sets of points and 374 kilometres of cable. In addition, track and overhead line work was pending. The station was completely closed for work during the Easter and summer holidays in 2017. A total of 90 replacement buses were operated.   The restoration of the historic entrance building was originally the responsibility of Deutsche Bahn, which wanted to find a private investor to carry out the restoration and subsequent operation by the spring of 2019. Deutsche Bahn also planned to sell some land at the station on which various ancillary buildings now stand to the municipal utility company, which intended to build the valley station of the planned Wuppertal cable car there. However, this project was abandoned after 61.6% of the participants voted against it in a citizens' poll on 26 May 2019. According to its own statement, Deutsche Bahn is in talks with \"multiple interests\". The selection process was stopped in the meantime to await the results of the citizens' survey and will continue after the decision of the town council to end the cable car project. However, it was not to be expected that the sale would be concluded in 2019.      A public piano has been located in the station hall since November 2018.  Services Although the station possesses only five tracks, less than the other stations of the city, all services running through Wuppertal stop here, except for the S 68 S-Bahn service terminating in Vohwinkel.  Long-distance trains stop every 30 minutes on platforms 1 and 2 running in either direction. ICE line 10 (Cologne\u2013Berlin) provides a direct connection to Berlin in under four hours.

The Hall was built by the Bateman family.  They were a well-established Norfolk family who settled at Hartington in the 16th century.  Richard Bateman married Ellen Toplis of Tissington and it was their eldest son, Hugh, who built the new manor house at Hartington in 1611. In 1862 Thomas Osborne Bateman oversaw  the substantial alteration and extension. The work was carried out by Henry Isaac Stevens of Derby.  The house is built to an H plan: the main entrance front has three storeys and three gabled bays, the central bay recessed with an off-centre porch entrance. The dates of building and alterations are recorded on a lintel above the door. It is now a Grade II listed building.  The Batemans remained at Hartington until the 20th century. In 1934 the property was opened as a youth hostel by the Youth Hostels Association (YHA) and became the property of YHA in 1948. Though it retains dormitory accommodation, it has many small rooms with ensuite facilities. There is a restaurant on site, open to the public as well as guests.

Pathology SHOX was first found during a search for the cause of short stature in women with Turner syndrome, where there is loss of genetic material from the X chromosome, typically by loss of one entire X chromosome.   Since its discovery, the gene has been found to play a role in idiopathic short stature, L\u00e9ri-Weill dyschondrosteosis, and Langer mesomelic dysplasia.   Gene dosage effects of extra copies of SHOX may be a cause of the increased stature seen in other sex chromosome aneuploidy conditions such as triple X, XYY, Klinefelter, XXYY and similar syndromes.  Genetics and function  SHOX is composed of 6 different exons and is located in the pseudoautosomal region 1 (PAR1) of the X chromosome (Xp22.33) and Y chromosome. Since genes in PAR escape X inactivation, their dosage changes with sex chromosome aneuploidies such as Turner.  Similar genes are present in a variety of animals and insects.

He is known for starring as Arthur Everest in the Amazon Studios television series The Tick, as the voice of Orko in the Netflix animated series Masters of the Universe: Revelation, and for cohosting the film podcast Blank Check with Griffin and David alongside critic David Sims.  Early life Newman is the son of film producer Peter Newman and casting director Antonia Dauphin. His maternal grandfather, Claude Dauphin, was a French actor. His younger brother, James Newman, is also an actor. Newman was raised in Greenwich Village, and attended Saint Ann's School.  He was interested in performing from an early age, often performing Fozzie Bear routines for friends and family. He started stand-up comedy at the age of ten as part of the 'Kidsncomedy' program run by Jo Ann Grossman. His material was mostly political, workshopped with his father. He began getting some attention from agents at this time, though his parents were reluctant for him to pursue a career in acting. His first onscreen appearance was as 'Teenage Fan' in the mockumentary The Buried Secret of M. Night Shyamalan. His role was mostly cut for the film. As a teenager, Newman regularly attended Buck's Rock Performing and Creative Arts Camp.  Newman started college in 2007 at California Institute of the Arts with the intention of becoming a filmmaker. He dropped out after seven months in order to pursue a career in comedy and acting.  Career Newman's first major onscreen appearance is in the film The Treatment in 2006 as high school student Scott. He went on to play roles in a number of shorts and student films. He also began performing stand-up regularly around this time and produced a one-man show titled Grifftopia, which he performed in 2009 and 2010.  In 2010, Newman appeared in the teen film Beware The Gonzo in the role of Horny Rob Becker, one of the friends of the titular Gonzo (Ezra Miller). Though the film was released to mixed reviews, Newman's performance was positively reviewed, with Odie Henderson from RogerEbert.com writing that \"Becker is the most interesting character in the film.\"  Over the next few years, Newman guest starred in a number of television shows, including Blue Bloods, Big Lake, and Law and Order: Special Victims Unit, as well as appearing in sketches for FunnyOrDie.  He played the role of Russ in the television mini-series Political Animals for the USA Network, and was listed by Just For Laughs as one of the 2012 New Faces of Comedy: Characters.  In 2013, Newman was cast in John Mulaney\u2019s sitcom Mulaney for NBC as Seymour. The network passed on the show after shooting the pilot, but later in the year, it was picked up by Fox with the role of Seymour cut from the script. Newman has described the situation as his own version of the Dark Phoenix saga.  Later that year, Newman became a correspondent for Nikki and Sara Live, and began making regular appearances on The Chris Gethard Show. Alongside Riley Soloner, he hosted the podcast Talking TCGS from 2013 to 2014. He hosted The Awooga Comedy Hour with Andrew Tavin from January 2013, a live comedy show that became weekly from May 2014.

He went on to have supporting roles in other feature films including Fort Tilden, Free The Nipple, and Naomi and Ely's No-Kiss List.  Newman has appeared in a number of webseries, including Snarky Sidekick and The Untitled Web Series That Morgan Evans Is Doing for MTV; he starred as the Director in Colin Quinn's webseries Cop Show for all three seasons.  With critic David Sims, Newman started The Phantom Podcast in March 2015, a podcast dedicated to analysing the film The Phantom Menace as though it was the only movie in the Star Wars franchise. The show went on to discuss the other Star Wars films before being retitled Blank Check with Griffin & David, and establishing its new premise. The podcast involves Sims, Newman, and sometimes a guest, discussing filmographies of directors who have had massive success early on in their career which has enabled them to be given free rein to make large scale passion projects. The podcast has received praise from critics.  In 2016 Newman had a supporting role in the HBO series Vinyl, and guest starred in the sitcoms Search Party and Difficult People. Later that year, it was announced Newman would be playing Arthur Everest in Amazon Video\u2019s new reboot of The Tick alongside Peter Serafinowicz in the titular role. The pilot, directed by Wally Pfister, was released on August 18, 2016. The show was picked up for a first season in September 2016.  The first six episodes of the first season were released on August 25, 2017. The remaining six episodes of the first season were released on February 23, 2018.  On January 17, 2018, Amazon ordered a second season of 10 episodes, which premiered in 2019. Newman has received critical acclaim for his portrayal of Everest. In May 2019, Amazon Studios announced that the show would not return for a third season.  Newman has a small role in Woody Allen's film A Rainy Day in New York, previously set for release in 2018. In October 2017, Newman made a statement via his Twitter expressing his regret at taking the role in the film, due to the allegations of sexual abuse against Allen.

Newman regularly appears as part of Connor Ratliff's The George Lucas Talk Show at UCB, as Watto. After the UCB theater closed down due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Ratliff, Newman and their UCB producer Patrick Cotnoir started doing weekly regular episodes and charity marathon livestream versions of the show on the streaming network PlanetScum.live. The charity livestreams have raised over $100,000 for various charities while marathoning through TV shows like Arli$$, Big Lake and Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip.  In February 2020, Newman was announced as the voice of Orko in the upcoming Netflix series Masters of the Universe: Revelation after campaigning online for the role when the show was first announced.

The tune was originally published in A Sett of Psalm & Hymn Tunes with some Select Pieces and an Anthem in 1805 as a setting for \"Grace 'tis a charming sound\" by Philip Doddridge, but soon became more widely known as a tune for \"While Shepherds Watched Their Flocks\" by Nahum Tate. The tune is 86.88.666 but is commonly used with lyrics in common metre (86.86).  In order to fit, the third line is sung twice and the fourth three times as in \"Grace 'tis a charming sound\", \"While Shepherds Watched Their Flocks\" and \"On Ilkla Moor baht 'at\".  Thomas Clark was a regular visitor to Cranbrook, Kent in the 1790s, and may have composed the tune there, possibly with the help of a local schoolmaster, John Francis. Clark later became a choirmaster and composed many other tunes for churches and Sunday Schools.

It is usually set to the lyrics of \"God moves in a mysterious way\", written in the 18th century by the Rev. William Cowper, but is also used with other lyrics, for example, \"Now thank we all our God\" by Martin Luther. The tune is named after the Cranbrook Church of England Primary School in Kent, where it was played by the school's band in the late 19th century. It was first published in the early 20th century in Hymns Ancient & Modern, and is now (as of 2013) in the public domain. Cranbrook is a common choice for church organists in the UK and other countries with a strong Anglican tradition, such as Australia, Canada, and South Africa. It can also be played on an organ or piano with a verse or two of the hymn \"Now thank we all our God\", with which it has a complementary rhythm, and at the same tempo. A version of the tune with alternative lyrics, \"Light of the World\", was written by the Rev. Frederick William Faber and published in his collection of hymns, Poems on the Name of Jesus Christ, in 1857. The tune is in common time. It has a half-note (minim) pulse, and consists of two sections, each consisting of two phrases of four bars, with the first phrase of each section a repeat of the second phrase. The first phrase of each section consists of two minims (half-notes) and two quarter-notes (crotchets), the second phrase consists of three minims and a crotchet. The first section is followed by a two-bar sequence consisting of a minim and a crotchet in the first bar, and a minim and two quarter-notes in the second. The tune then returns to the first section, and so on. The first three notes of the tune, given in the key of C major, are C, D, E, the first two of which are the tonic, and the third a note which has already appeared in the key signature. This E is a \"chromatic neighbour note\" to the tonic, and gives a gentle hint of colouration to the otherwise diatonic (seven-note) scale. This initial figure is then repeated, transposed up a perfect fifth, and the process is repeated a further two times, giving a symmetrical structure of two, three, two, three, two bars.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 33788397}

This enables developing Web applications in C++. The GET and POST requests are interpreted by the tntnet server and sent to the web application program, which will send a reply back over the network. Tntnet is free software released under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).  Tntnet provides many of the same features as script-based CGI, but with different tradeoffs.  Being C++ based, tntnet allows the use of methods such as object-oriented programming and polymorphism, which are also supported in modern scripting languages.  Under tntnet, the web application is compiled ahead of time, while script-based CGIs are often interpreted.  Compiled modules, being native, will generally be faster than scripts.  Programs such as cgid or fastcgi can be used to improve the performance of script-based CGIs.  Tntnet directly integrates the web application into the webserver. Webservers often have APIs for doing this.  Apache HTTP Server uses a module system, where Internet Information Services (IIS) uses Internet Server Application Programming Interface (ISAPI). Tntnet originally used Apache's module system, but this was changed due to the difficulty of interfacing with Apache through its C API while maintaining the benefits of using C++.  In this situation, Tommi M\u00e4kitalo developed the tntnet framework. Tntnet is also a webserver, which is present in the source code. This way, tntnet acts as a layer in front of the actual web application. When in use, the webserver part receives the HTTP requests, interprets them and sends them to the (binary) web application part.

Governor of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.  It is the fifth least populous district in the country (out of 640).  Etymology Falling on the sea route between South India / Sri Lanka and South East Asia, the sailors referred it as \u201cland of the naked\u201d i.e. Nakkavar which is perhaps the direct precursor of the current name \u201cNicobar\u2019.

The district is designated as an Integrated Tribal District and is home to significant numbers of indigenous peoples (namely, the Nicobarese and the Shompen, classified as Scheduled Tribes according to the Constitution of India), who form the majority of the district's population. Because of its status as a tribal area, travel to the district is restricted to Indian nationals, and special permit restrictions apply.  The district was severely affected by the tsunami that was caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, which led to many deaths and damaged infrastructure.  Language  Nicobarese, of the Austroasiatic language family is the most spoken language in Nicobar Islands. As of 2011 census, Nicobarese is spoken as the first language by 65.98 per cent of the district's population followed by Hindi (9.83%), Tamil (6.10%), Telugu (4.05%), Bengali (3.90%), Kurukh (3.31%), Malayalam (1.79%) and others.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Del Webb Explosion\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Del Webb Explosion was a seven-piece band cast in the mold of British soul revivalists Dexy's Midnight Runners. (They) were active in Adelaide for only 20 months from 1981\u20131983 with their first gig at the Union Hotel on 7 December 1981. A brass based pop band with strong British soul influences, The band was founded in Adelaide, South Australia, by Peter Flierl who had just returned from a trip to the UK with an incredibly strong impression having been left by the sounds of Dexys Midnight Runners and the very recently formed splinter group from that ensemble, The Bureau. The band's name was provided by early Del Webb guitarist, Gerry Barrett, and was named after American construction magnate and real estate developer, Delbert Eugene Webb.  The 'Explosion' just seemed to follow.  History  Beginning Peter Flierl (bass guitar, backing vocals, song-writing) started with an advertisement in the local newspaper 'want ads' seeking like-minded musicians to form an 8 piece soul/pop band to play a mix of original and cover songs. Drummer Heinz Stein responded early and was clearly attuned to what Flierl had in mind. Mankyboddle (lead vocals), Barrett (guitar) and Pasetto (tenor sax) were enlisted shortly afterwards, forming the nucleus of the band. Rehearsals commenced with a handful of early songs written for the band by Flierl together with several soul standards and rounded off with a generous selection of Dexys songs from their debut release, 'Searching for the Young Soul Rebels. The band's initial line-up was rounded off with the twin trumpets of Daniel Clements and Rob Symons. A debut gig supporting local favourites, The Screaming Believers, at the Union Hotel, introduced the band to an appreciative Adelaide audience and from then the 'Explosion' proceeded to gig regularly for the approximate 12 months of its existence.  Although being integral to scoring brass charts to Flierl's initial compositions for the band, Pasetto left the band prior to their initial foray into the now defunct Pepper Recording Studios in North Adelaide. Symons had also departed around this time and the band recruited Burton on alto sax and Berrington on tenor to record the band's debut single \"One Way Love\" b/w \"Going Home\". The single was released on small local label 'Empty Dogma Records' and proceeded to notch up respectable local sales bringing the band to the attention of a wider audience. The band also self-financed a film clip shot at various suburban locations in Adelaide, to further promote the song. Although not venturing beyond the outskirts of the city, the band maintained a steady gigging profile building its fan base from regular performances at inner city venues like the Tivoli and Angas Hotels as well as regular appearances at the Adelaide University Bar.  Middle A heavy schedule of gigging from the outset created a level of interest from some of the major record labels in Adelaide. However cracks were beginning to show in the band with some members clearly not having the same commitment as others. It was around this time that Barrett was replaced by Oldman on lead guitar duties. Although still unsigned, the band decided to foray into the studio a second time to record the Mankyboddle penned \"Gardening as Finer Art\" backed with Flierl's \"Too Late The Hero\". Funds were tighter this time around for the band which resulted in a 'live' rendition of \"Too Late The Hero\" (recorded some weeks earlier at an Adelaide Uni Bar gig) becoming the B-side. The new single was released on local alternative record label, Greasy Pop Records and despite not having a video clip to accompany it, continued to increase the profile of the band with record company representatives. Keyboardist, Glenn Errington also left the band during this period to be replaced by Peter Flierl's multi-instrumentalist brother, Vic Flierl on keyboards at many 'live' performances by the band. Although the band continued to receive praise for their exciting stage performances, the band seemed to have \"more factions than a Labor Party conference\", largely due to musical differences, commitment and direction.  End Only 13 months into its existence and with a recording contract virtually on its door step, the band split with Flierl, Stein and Burton departing to form another band, Plan B, while Mankyboddle, Clements, Berrington & Oldman continued without them.      The band returned to public performances some 4 months later under the banner \"Del Webb Explosion \u2013 Back without Geno\", a clear statement that the earlier Dexys' influence which was such a major part of Flierl's basis for forming the band, was no longer in existence. In fact, when questioned about Geno at a show at the Tivoli in 1983, Mankyboddle said \"Geno was dead\"   Even though the final Line-Up didn't produce any records, it made some very good live recordings in which the new material took centre stage. According to Mankyboddle, new member Kim Webster (later New Romantics) on keyboards was an important facet of the new direction the band took. Del Webb Explosion Mark III was the attempt to forge, in this kind of band line-up, a more original band from what for a long time was essentially a cover band.The final break up in the end was due to a lack of commitment to go \"professional\", i.e. interstate, even though the actual band personalities and individual musicianship were much better matched. So, in the end it wasn't so much friction, as the lack of ambition of some of the new members. The reformed band permanently broke up in late 1983.  Beyond Del Webb Flierl, Stein and Burton quickly re-grouped to form Plan B which re-commenced gigging virtually the same week as the 'new' Del Webb Explosion. Following the second and final implosion of Del Webb Explosion, Mankyboddle joined forces with Steve Z to form The Sweets of Sin, an experimental crossover pop-band with strong modern classical and jazz influences.

The test was a joint project of the Atomic Energy Commission and the Defense Department, with the objective of developing a \"supersonic missile-deliverable nuclear warhead\". The first of several \" Priscilla \" tests, Del Webb was the first of the Plumbbob series to be conducted jointly with the United States Air Force. Del Webb was the second test of a nuclear device with a yield over 25 megatons, after the US's first thermonuclear test, Ivy Mike, in 1952. The device had a yield of 43 megatons, and was the first nuclear device to be fired at the Nevada Test Site. The device was also the first to be tested with an atomic artillery shell, fired from a specialized cannon toward a target tank. Following the test, the Atomic Energy Commission held a press conference, where they stated that the test \"appears to have been successful\". However, an investigation by the AEC's \"Project Caesar\" committee later found that the warhead had been destroyed in the explosion, and that the test had been a failure. The committee determined that the cause of the failure was a design flaw, which resulted in the warhead's destruction after only 2.5 inches (6.4 cm) of its movement into the missile. In the test, the device was fired from a Jupiter-C rocket, a modified Redstone missile. The missile was fired from the Green River, Utah, missile complex, and traveled 2,500 miles (4,000 km) to the test site. The warhead was a three-stage device, with a yield of 43 megatons in the first two stages, and a third stage designed to produce a yield of only 1.5 kilotons. The test was the first of a series of three tests, the others being the Blue Jay and the Kingfisher tests.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 31701543}

The linear approximation of a function is the first order Taylor expansion around the point of interest. In the study of dynamical systems, linearization is a method for assessing the local stability of an equilibrium point of a system of nonlinear differential equations or discrete dynamical systems.  This method is used in fields such as engineering, physics, economics, and ecology.  Linearization of a function Linearizations of a function are lines\u2014usually lines that can be used for purposes of calculation. Linearization is an effective method for approximating the output of a function  at any  based on the value and slope of the function at , given that  is differentiable on  (or ) and that  is close to . In short, linearization approximates the output of a function near .  For example, . However, what would be a good approximation of ?  For any given function ,  can be approximated if it is near a known differentiable point. The most basic requisite is that , where  is the linearization of  at . The point-slope form of an equation forms an equation of a line, given a point  and slope . The general form of this equation is: .  Using the point ,  becomes . Because differentiable functions are locally linear, the best slope to substitute in would be the slope of the line tangent to  at .  While the concept of local linearity applies the most to points arbitrarily close to , those relatively close work relatively well for linear approximations. The slope  should be, most accurately, the slope of the tangent line at .  Visually, the accompanying diagram shows the tangent line of  at .

Uses of linearization  Linearization makes it possible to use tools for studying linear systems to analyze the behavior of a nonlinear function near a given point.  The linearization of a function is the first order term of its Taylor expansion around the point of interest.  For a system defined by the equation  ,  the linearized system can be written as  where  is the point of interest and  is the Jacobian of  evaluated at .  Stability analysis In stability analysis of autonomous systems, one can use the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix evaluated at a hyperbolic equilibrium point to determine the nature of that equilibrium. This is the content of the linearization theorem. For time-varying systems, the linearization requires additional justification.  Microeconomics In microeconomics, decision rules may be approximated under the state-space approach to linearization. Under this approach, the Euler equations of the utility maximization problem are linearized around the stationary steady state. A unique solution to the resulting system of dynamic equations then is found.  Optimization In mathematical optimization, cost functions and non-linear components within can be linearized in order to apply a linear solving method such as the Simplex algorithm. The optimized result is reached much more efficiently and is deterministic as a global optimum.  Multiphysics In multiphysics systems\u2014systems involving multiple physical fields that interact with one another\u2014linearization with respect to each of the physical fields may be performed. This linearization of the system with respect to each of the fields results in a linearized monolithic equation system that can be solved using monolithic iterative solution procedures such as the Newton\u2013Raphson method. Examples of this include MRI scanner systems which results in a system of electromagnetic, mechanical and acoustic fields.

In digital systems, linearization is the process of approximating a nonlinear system by a linear system with minimum error. The process is used in both analog and digital circuits to make the circuit more predictable and stable. In analog circuits, linearization is done by adding a small nonlinear bias to the devices in the circuit. This makes the devices operate in a more linear region of their transfer function. In digital circuits, linearization is done by multiplying the input signal by a constant before feeding it to the nonlinear system. The constant is chosen such that the overall system becomes linear.

In analog circuits, the process also helps to reduce the distortion in the output signal. In digital circuits, the process helps to reduce the error in the output signal. In some cases, linearization is not possible, and a nonlinear system is designed to have minimum distortion. In such cases, the nonlinear system is designed to have a very high-order transfer function, which makes the system very sensitive to the input signal.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"It Can't Happen Here\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "It Can't Happen Here is a 1935 dystopian political novel by American author Sinclair Lewis. It describes the rise of a US dictator similar to how Adolf Hitler gained power. The novel was adapted into a play by Lewis and John C. Moffitt in 1936.  Premise The novel was published during the heyday of fascism in Europe, which was reported on by Dorothy Thompson, Lewis's wife. The novel describes the rise of Berzelius \"Buzz\" Windrip, a demagogue who is elected President of the United States, after fomenting fear and promising drastic economic and social reforms while promoting a return to patriotism and \"traditional\" values. After his election, Windrip takes complete control of the government and imposes totalitarian rule with the help of a ruthless paramilitary force, in the manner of European fascists such as Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. The novel's plot centers on journalist Doremus Jessup's opposition to the new regime and his subsequent struggle against it as part of a liberal rebellion.  Plot In 1936, Senator Berzelius \"Buzz\" Windrip, a charismatic and power-hungry politician, wins the 1936 United States presidential election on a populist platform, promising to restore the country to prosperity and greatness, and promising each citizen $5,000 per year. Portraying himself as a champion of traditional American values, Windrip defeats President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the Democratic convention, and then easily beats his Republican opponent, Senator Walt Trowbridge, in the November election.  Although having previously foreshadowed some authoritarian measures to reorganize the United States government, Windrip rapidly outlaws dissent, incarcerates political enemies in concentration camps, and trains and arms a paramilitary force called the Minute Men (named after the Revolutionary War militias of the same name), who terrorize citizens and enforce the policies of Windrip and his capitalist regime. One of Windrip's first acts as president is to eliminate the influence of the United States Congress, which draws the ire of many citizens as well as the legislators themselves. The Minute Men respond to protests against Windrip's decisions harshly, attacking demonstrators with bayonets. In addition to these actions, Windrip's administration, known as the Corpo government, curtails women's and minority rights, and eliminates individual states by subdividing the country into administrative sectors. The government of these sectors is managed by Corpo authorities, usually prominent businessmen or Minute Men officers.  Those accused of crimes against the government appear before kangaroo courts presided over by military judges. Despite these dictatorial and \"quasi-draconian\" measures, a majority of Americans approve of them, seeing them as painful but necessary steps to restore U.S. power.  One of Windrip's cronies brings up the matter of fascism in America, but Francis Tasbrough, the wealthy owner of the quarry in Jessup's home town, dismisses it with the remark that it simply \"can't happen here\" (hence the novel's title).  Open opponents of Windrip, led by Senator Trowbridge, form an organization called the New Underground (named after the Underground Railroad), helping dissidents escape to Canada and distributing anti-Windrip propaganda. One recruit to the New Underground is Doremus Jessup, the novel's protagonist, a traditional liberal and an opponent of both corporatist and communist theories, the latter of which Windrip's administration suppresses. Jessup's participation in the organization results in the publication of a periodical called The Vermont Vigilance, in which he writes editorials decrying Windrip's abuses of power.  Shad Ledue, the local district commissioner and Jessup's former hired man, resents his old employer. Ledue eventually discovers Jessup's actions and has him sent to a concentration camp. Ledue subsequently terrorizes Jessup's family and particularly his daughter Sissy, whom he unsuccessfully attempts to seduce. Sissy discovers evidence of corrupt dealings on the part of Ledue, which she exposes to Francis Tasbrough, a one-time friend of Jessup and Ledue's superior in the administrative hierarchy. Tasbrough has Ledue imprisoned in the same camp as Jessup, where inmates Ledue had sent there organize Ledue's murder. After a relatively brief incarceration, Jessup escapes when his friends bribe one of the camp guards. He flees to Canada, where he rejoins the New Underground. He later serves the organization as a spy, passing along information and urging locals to resist Windrip.  In time, Windrip's hold on power weakens as the economic prosperity he promised does not materialize, and increased numbers of disillusioned Americans, including Vice President Perley Beecroft, flee to both Canada and Mexico. Windrip also angers his Secretary of State, Lee Sarason, who had served earlier as his chief political operative and adviser. Sarason and Windrip's other lieutenants, including General Dewey Haik, seize power and exile the president to France. Sarason succeeds Windrip, but his extravagant and relatively weak rule creates a power vacuum in which Haik and others vie for power. In a bloody putsch, Haik leads a party of military supporters into the White House, kills Sarason and his associates, and proclaims himself president. The two coups cause a slow erosion of Corpo power, and Haik's government desperately tries to arouse patriotism by launching an unjustified invasion of Mexico. After slandering Mexico in state-run newspapers, Haik orders a mass conscription of young American men for the invasion of that country, infuriating many who had until then been staunch Corpo loyalists. Riots and rebellions break out across the country, with many realizing the Corpos have misled them.  General Emmanuel Coon, among Haik's senior officers, defects to the opposition with a large portion of his army, giving strength to the resistance movement. Although Haik remains in control of much of the country, civil war soon breaks out as the resistance tries to consolidate its grasp on the Midwest. The novel ends after the beginning of the conflict, with Jessup working as an agent for the New Underground in Corpo-occupied portions of southern Minnesota.  Reception  Reviewers at the time, and historians and literary critics ever since, have emphasized the resemblance to Louisiana politician Huey Long, who used strong-arm political tactics and who was building a nationwide \"Share Our Wealth\" organization in preparing to run for president in the 1936 election. Long was assassinated in 1935 just prior to the novel's publication.  According to Boulard (1998), \"the most chilling and uncanny treatment of Huey by a writer came with Sinclair Lewis's It Can't Happen Here.\" Lewis portrayed a genuine U.S. dictator on the Hitler model. Starting in 1936, the Works Progress Administration, a New Deal agency, performed the stage adaptation across the country; Lewis had the goal of hurting Long's chances in the 1936 election.  Keith Perry argues that the key weakness of the novel is not that he decks out U.S. politicians with sinister European touches, but that he finally conceives of fascism and totalitarianism in terms of traditional U.S. political models rather than seeing them as introducing a new kind of society and a new kind of regime. Windrip is less a Nazi than a con-man-plus-Rotarian, a manipulator who knows how to appeal to people's desperation, but neither he nor his followers are in the grip of the kind of world-transforming ideology like Hitler's Nazism.  Adaptations  Stage In 1936, Lewis and John C. Moffitt wrote a stage version, also titled It Can't Happen Here, which is still produced. The stage version premiered on October 27, 1936, in 21 U.S. theatres in 17 states simultaneously, in productions sponsored by the Federal Theater Project.  The Z Collective, a San Francisco theater company, adapted the novel for the stage, producing it both in 1989 and 1992. In 2004, Z Space adapted the Collective's script into a radio drama that was broadcast on the Pacifica radio network on the anniversary of the Federal Theater Project's original premiere.  A new stage adaptation by Tony Taccone and Bennett S. Cohen premiered at the Berkeley Repertory Theatre in September 2016.  Unfinished film Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) purchased the rights in late 1935 for a reported $200,000 from seeing the galley proofs, with Lucien Hubbard (Wings) as the producer. By early 1936, screenwriter Sidney Howard completed an adaptation, his third of Lewis's novels. J. Walter Ruben was named to direct the film with the cast headed by Lionel Barrymore, Walter Connolly, Virginia Bruce, and Basil Rathbone. Studio head Louis B. Mayer indefinitely postponed production, citing costs, to the publicly announced pleasure of the Nazi regime in Germany. Lewis and Howard countered that financial reason with information pointing to Berlin's and Rome's influence on movies. Will H. Hays, responsible for the enforcement of the Motion Picture Production Code, had notified Mayer of potential problems in the German market. Joseph Breen, head of the Production Code Administration department under Hays, thought the script was too \"anti-fascist\" and \"so filled with dangerous material\".  In December 1938, Charlie Chaplin announced his next movie would satirize Hitler (The Great Dictator). MGM's Hubbard \"dusted off the script\" in January, but the \"idea of a dictator ruling America\" had now been discussed in public for years. Hubbard rewrote a new climax, \"showing a dictatorship in Washington and showing it being kicked out by disgruntled Americans as soon as they realized what had happened.\" The film was placed back on the production schedule for the third time with shooting starting in June and Lewis Stone playing Doremus Jessup. By July 1939, MGM \"admitted it would not make the movie after all\" to some criticism.  Television The 1968 television movie Shadow on the Land, which also went by the title United States: It Can't Happen Here, was produced by Screen Gems as a backdoor pilot for a series. The TV movie, a thriller which takes place following the fascist takeover, is often cited as an adaptation of Lewis's novel but does not credit the novel.  Inspired by the book, director\u2013producer Kenneth Johnson in 1982 scripted a miniseries entitled Storm Warnings. NBC executives, to whom Johnson presented the script, rejected the original, which they considered too cerebral for the average American viewer. In order to make the script more marketable, Storm Warnings was revised into a far less subtle alien invasion  story in which the invaders initially pose as humanity's friends. The new script formed the basis for the popular miniseries V, which premiered May 3, 1983.  Legacy Since its publication, It Can't Happen Here has been seen as a cautionary tale, starting with the 1936 presidential election and potential candidate Huey Long.  In retrospect, Franklin D. Roosevelt's internment of Japanese Americans during World War II has been used as an example of \"It can happen here\".  Frank Zappa and The Mothers of Invention released their first album Freak Out! in 1966 with the song \"It Can't Happen Here\".  In May 1973, in the middle of the Watergate scandal, Knight Newspapers published an ad in their own and other publications, headlined \"It Can't Happen Here\" and emphasizing the importance of free press: \"There is a struggle going on in this country. It is not just a fight by reporters and editors to protect their sources. It is a fight to protect the public's right to know. [...] It can't happen here as long as the press remains an open conduit through which public information flows.\" Herbert Mitgang in his op-ed piece said \"The headline of this ad is the title of a novel that keeps insinuating itself these days, not because of its literary qualities but because of its prescience.\" And that Lewis's point was \"that home\u2010grown hypocrisy leads to a nice brand of home\u2010grown authoritarianism.\"  Joe Conason's non-fiction book It Can Happen Here: Authoritarian Peril in the Age of Bush (2007) frequently quotes Lewis's book in relation to the presidency of George W. Bush.  In 2018, HarperCollins published Can It Happen Here?: Authoritarianism in America, a collection of essays about the prospect of authoritarianism in the United States, edited by Cass Sunstein.  In 2019, Robert Evans produced the podcast series It Could Happen Here, which speculated on the causes and consequences of a hypothetical second American Civil War.  In 2021, New York University Press published a book It Can Happen Here: White Power and the Rising Threat of Genocide in the US by genocide scholar Alexander Laban Hinton. Hinton argued that \"there is a real risk of violent atrocities happening in the United States\".  Presidency of Donald Trump Several writers have compared the demagogue Buzz Windrip to Donald Trump. Michael Paulson wrote in The New York Times that the Berkeley Repertory Theatre's 2016 rendition of the play aimed to provoke discussion about Trump's presidential candidacy. Writing for The Guardian, Jules Stewart discussed the similarities between Trump's America with the country as depicted in the book. In Salon, Maclolm Harris stated: \"Like Trump, Windrip uses a lack of tact as a way to distinguish himself\" and \"The social forces that Windrip and Trump invoke aren\u2019t funny, they\u2019re murderous.\" In The Washington Post, Carlos Lozada compared Trump to Windrip, opining that \"it is impossible to miss the similarities between Trump and totalitarian figures in American literature.\" Jacob Weisberg wrote in Slate that one \"can\u2019t read Lewis' novel today without flashes of Trumpian recognition.\" Following the results of the 2016 United States presidential election, sales of It Can't Happen Here surged significantly, and it appeared on Amazon.com's list of bestselling books. Penguin Modern Classics released a new edition of the novel on January 20, 2017, the same day as the inauguration of Donald Trump.

The narrative focuses on a writer (presumably Goytisolo himself) who, while traveling in Spain in the early 1930s, becomes convinced that the country is about to be overthrown by a Soviet-style revolution, and that the change will be brought about by the wealthy, the clergy, and the military, in league with the Nazis. The book was written in the early 1980s, at the height of the Cold War, and published in 1985, four years before the Revolutions of 1989 and the fall of the Berlin Wall. The title is taken from the book It Can't Happen Here, a 1935 novel by Sinclair Lewis which was adapted into a film of the same name in 1936. It Can't Happen Here is structured as a first-person account, in the form of a diary, by a writer in the months leading up to the hypothetical revolution. The narrator is Goytisolo himself, in his late thirties, living in Paris, and traveling frequently to Barcelona, where he has a part-time job in a publishing house. The narrator's mother, who lives in Barcelona, is a staunch supporter of the Right, and a friend of the editor of the newspaper El Sol. The narrator's father, a doctor, is more moderate, and is sympathetic to the Left, which he sees as \"the least bad of the existing options\". The narrator's sister, who is married to a Frenchman and lives in Paris, is a convinced Communist. In the course of his travels through Spain, the narrator meets various characters who reinforce his belief in the coming revolution, including a Madrid friend who works for the newspaper El Sol, a priest, a group of students, and a wealthy friend of his mother's, Do\u00f1a Lucrecia, who is planning to sell her property in Spain and move to Argentina. The narrator's travels also introduce him to the poverty and social unrest that he believes will soon erupt in revolution. He spends time in Barcelona with a friend who is active in the underground, and who tells him about the various working-class organizations and their revolutionary plans. The narrator also visits a mining town, where he sees first-hand the miserable living conditions of the workers and the squalid housing provided for them by the company. The narrator's belief in the coming revolution is further strengthened by his observations of the behavior of the wealthy, the clergy, and the military, all of whom he sees as collaborators in the coming coup. He notes that the wealthy are increasingly fearful of the workers and the poor, and are therefore planning to leave the country. He also observes that the Catholic Church is preparing for the revolution by creating an underground network of churches and religious schools, where the young will be indoctrinated with conservative ideology. Finally, he notes that the military is increasing its spending and recruitment efforts, and that the officers are making plans to seize power when the time comes. In the end, the narrator's belief in the coming revolution is not borne out, and he is left disappointed and confused. However, he is able to find a measure of comfort in the fact that he was wrong, and that Spain did not, in fact, experience a Soviet-style revolution in the 1930s.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 201227}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Morpeth, Northumberland\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Morpeth is a historic market town in Northumberland, North East England, lying on the River Wansbeck. Nearby towns include Ashington and Bedlington. In the 2011 census, the population of Morpeth was given as 14,017, up from 13,833 in the 2001 census. The earliest evidence of settlement is believed to be from the Neolithic period, and some Roman artifacts have also been found. The first written mention of the town is from 1080, when the de Merlay family was granted the barony of Morpeth. The meaning of the town's name is uncertain, but it may refer to its position on the road to Scotland and a murder which occurred on that road. The de Merlay family built two castles in the town in the late 11th century and the 13th century. The town was granted its coat of arms in 1552. By the mid 1700s it had become one of the main markets in England, having been granted a market charter in 1200, but the opening of the railways in the 1800s led the market to decline. The town's history is celebrated in the annual Northumbrian Gathering.  Morpeth is governed by Northumberland County Council and Morpeth Town Council. The town is split into three wards \u2013 North, Kirkhill and Stobhill \u2013 for the purposes of parish elections. In 2008 the town suffered a severe flood, which was repeated in 2012, resulting in the construction of new flood defences. Morpeth railway station is on the east coast line and a curve to the south of it has caused several rail crashes. Several sports teams compete in Morpeth, with Morpeth Town A.F.C. having been the winner of the FA Vase in 2016. The town hosted its own Olympics from 1873 to 1958. Two middle schools, a high school and seven first schools are situated in Morpeth, as well as several churches of Anglican, Roman Catholic, United Reformed and Methodist denominations. Morpeth's Carlisle Park, the recipient of several awards, contains one of the four floral clocks in England.  History  Morpeth was founded at a crossing point of the River Wansbeck. Remains from prehistory are scarce, but the earliest evidence of occupation found is a stone axe thought to be from the Neolithic period. There is a lack of evidence of activity during the Roman occupation of Britain, although there were probably settlements in the area at that time. The first written reference is from 1080 when William de Merlay was rewarded for his part in suppressing a rebellion in Northumbria with \"the Barony of Morthpeth stretching from the Tyne to the Coquet\". Morpeth is recorded in the Assize Rolls of Northumberland of 1256 as Morpath and Morthpath, and was also archaically spelt Morepath. The meaning of the town's name is uncertain; \"moor path\" has been suggested in reference to its historical position on the main road from England to Scotland, with the marshes around the modern-day Carlisle Park having been suggested to be the \"moor\" in question. Another possible meaning is that the name derives from the Old English pre-7th-century compound mor\u00f0-p\u00e6\u00f0 or Morthpaeth, meaning \"murder path\", in remembrance of \"some forgotten\" slaying on the road, although some old documents suggest that this meaning is a fallacy.  The barony of Morpeth was granted to the de Merlay family in around 1080, and by 1095 a motte-and-bailey castle had been built by William de Merlay. It is uncertain whether there was any settlement at Morpeth at the time that the barony was created, and documents relating to the foundation of an abbey in 1137 refer to the 'new town of Morpeth'.  Newminster Abbey, located on the outskirts of Morpeth, was founded in 1138 by William's son, Ranulf de Merlay, lord of Morpeth, and his wife, Juliana, daughter of Gospatric II, Earl of Lothian, as one of the first daughter houses of Fountains Abbey. King John granted a market charter for the town to Roger de Merlay in 1200. It became one of the main markets in Northern England by the mid 1700s and by the mid 18th century was one of the key cattle markets in England selling cattle driven by drovers over the border from Scotland; however, the opening of the railways made transport to Newcastle easier in the 19th century, and the market accordingly declined. The market is still held on Wednesdays.  The town was badly damaged by fire set by the barons in 1215 during the First Barons' War, in an attempt to block the military operations of King John. Whilst it is common report that the motte-and-bailey castle was burnt down by King John in 1216  and a new Morpeth Castle was built later in the 13th century by Ranulph de Merlay, to the south of Haw Hill, there is no firm evidence that King John destroyed the castle and an alternative narrative suggests that the second castle was in fact 'completed by William de Merlay (the 2nd) in the year of his death' (c.1170).  In the 13th century, a stone bridge was built over the Wansbeck in Morpeth, to the west of the current bridge, replacing the ford previously in use in Morpeth. For some months in 1515\u201316, Margaret Tudor (Henry VIII's sister) who was the Queen Consort of Scotland (James IV's widow), had laid ill in Morpeth Castle, having been brought there from Harbottle Castle. The only remains of the castle are the inner gatehouse, which was restored by the Landmark Trust, and parts of the ruined castle walls.  In 1540, Morpeth was described by the royal antiquary John Leland as \"long and metely well-builded, with low houses\" and \"a far fairer town than Alnwick\". During the 1543\u201351 war of the Rough Wooing, Morpeth was occupied by a garrison of Italian mercenaries, who \"pestered such a little street standing in the highway\" by killing deer and withholding payment for food. In 1552, William Hervey, Norroy King of Arms, granted the borough of Morpeth a coat of arms. The arms were the same as those granted to Roger de Merlay, but with the addition of a gold tower. In the letters patent, Hervey noted that he had included the arms of the \"noble and valyaunt knyght ... for a p'petuall memory of his good will and benevolence towardes the said towne\".  Morpeth was a borough by prescription, but received its first charter of confirmation from Charles II. The corporation it created was controlled by seven companies: the Merchant Tailors, the Tanners, the Fullers and Dyers, the Smiths, the Cordwainers, the Weavers and the Butchers. This remained the governing charter until the borough was reformed by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835. During the Second World War, RAF Morpeth, an air-gunnery training school, opened at nearby Tranwell.  The town and the county's history and culture are celebrated at the annual Northumbrian Gathering.  The gathering is held over a weekend in mid-April and includes the Border Cavalcade and Pageant. The 50th gathering took place in 2017.  Governance  Morpeth has two tiers of local government.  The lower tier is Morpeth Town Council, which has 15 members. Morpeth is a civil parish with the status of a town. For the purposes of parish elections the town is divided into three wards: North, Kirkhill and Stobhill, each returning five town councillors. Each ward also elects one County Councillor. In May 2021, the political make up of the Town Council was ten Conservatives, two Liberal Democrats, two Green and one Labour member.  The upper tier of local government is Northumberland County Council, which meets at County Hall in Morpeth. Since April 2009 the county council has been a unitary authority. Previous to this there was an intermediate tier, the non-metropolitan district of Castle Morpeth, which has been abolished along with all other districts in the county. The county council has 67 councillors, of whom three represent Morpeth, one each from the electoral wards of Morpeth Kirkhill, Morpeth North and Morpeth Stobhill. The 2017 and 2021 County Council elections both elected three Conservative councillors for the three wards.  Climate  Cockle Park, located slightly north of Morpeth, contains a Met Office weather station, founded in 1897.  2008 and 2012 floods  On 6 September 2008, Morpeth suffered a severe flood, causing damage to 1,000 properties and leading 400 residents to be evacuated. The town's flood defences were breached after 12 hours, when a month's worth of rain fell on Morpeth.  In September 2012, flooding occurred again, causing damage to properties, although floodwaters were reportedly  shallower than in 2008.  Flood defences Work on flood defences started in 2013 in response to the 2008 floods. New flood defences were built in the town centre and a dam with a storage reservoir was built on the Mitford Estate. A second \u00a327m dam was completed in May 2017 to reduce flooding from the Cotting Burn and marked the completion of the Morpeth flood defence plan.  Transport  The A1, the longest numbered road in the UK, used to pass through Morpeth until the bypass was opened in 1970. Morpeth's railway station is on the main East Coast Main Line which runs between London and Edinburgh. To the south of the station is a sharp curve which has been the scene of several train crashes. A non-passenger line operates between Morpeth and Bedlington. A former line, closed in 1966, ran west from Morpeth to Scots Gap (from where there was a branch line to Rothbury), then west to Redesmouth, and lastly south to Hexham.  Education   The local state school, King Edward VI School, was originally founded as a chantry school in the early 14th century and was located in the Morpeth Chantry. The school was refounded in 1552 by royal charter as the Free Grammar School of King Edward the Sixth, being commonly referred to as the Morpeth Grammar School by locals. The school was renamed to King Edward VI Grammar School by 1947 and in the 1970s lost its grammar school status, becoming a comprehensive under the current name.  The town has two middle schools, Newminster and Chantry, which are built next door to one another. It also has several first schools: Abbeyfields First School in Kirkhill, Morpeth First School in Loansdean to the south of the town, Stobhillgate First School in the Stobhillgate housing estate, and Morpeth All Saints' Church of England-aided First School in Lancaster Park, which is located north of the town. Additionally, St. Robert's R.C. First School, a primary school for Roman Catholics, is located in Oldgate, Morpeth.  Religious sites  Church of England The ancient Church of England parish church of Morpeth is St Mary's at High Church, which was the main Anglican place of worship in the area until the 1840s. The church is mostly in the 14th century style. The grave of Emily Wilding Davison lies in St Mary's graveyard.  In 1843, a public meeting was called to address the lack of attendance at the church, and it was found that the walk to the current church, then on the southern edge of the town, was too much for many of the parishioners. From this meeting, it was decided to build a new church in the town centre and accordingly, the church of St James the Great was consecrated for worship on 15 October 1846. Benjamin Ferrey designed the church in a \"Neo-Norman\" style, based on the 12th century Monreale Cathedral, Sicily.  A third parish church, St Aidan's, was founded as a mission church in 1957, located on the Stobhill estate on the south-east of the town.  Roman Catholic Church Morpeth's Roman Catholic Church, dedicated to St Robert of Newminster, was built off Oldgate on land adjacent to Admiral Lord Collingwood's house. It opened on 1 August 1850 and was consecrated by the Right Reverend, William Hogarth, Bishop of Samosata (later Bishop of Hexham). Collingwood House is now the presbytery (residence) for the priest in charge of the Church.  United Reformed Church Morpeth has had a Presbyterian ministry since 1693. Their first service was held in a tannery loft in the town in February 1693 and in 1721 a chapel was built in Cottingwood Lane, which still exists as a private home. The construction of St. George's United Reformed Church began in 1858 and the first service in the new building was held on 12 April 1860. The Church stands immediately to the north of the Telford Bridge and is in the style of the early English era, containing a stained glass rose window and an octagonal spirelet.  Methodist Church The present Methodist Church in Howard Terrace was opened as a Primitive Methodist place of worship on 24 April 1905. Designed by J. Walton Taylor, it was built from local quarry stone. Although the Primitive Methodists were united with the Wesleyan Church to form the Methodist Church of Great Britain in 1932, a separate Wesleyan Church continued to function in Manchester Street until 1964, when the congregations were united at Howard Terrace. The former Wesleyan Church (built in 1883) is currently used as the Boys' Brigade headquarters.  Sport  Morpeth Town A.F.C., Morpeth RFC and the Morpeth Golf Club play competitively within Morpeth. In addition, the Morpeth Harriers compete in athletics. The town also offers opportunities to play sport on a non-competitive basis through facilities such as Carlisle Park, the common for playing golf and football, and the Riverside leisure centre for swimming, indoor sports and fitness gym activities. Morpeth Town A.F.C. was the 2016 winner of the FA Vase.  The Morpeth Olympic Games, a professional event consisting mainly of athletics and wrestling, were staged from 1873 until 1958, barring interruptions during the two world wars. The Games were held on the Old Brewery Field until 1896, then at Grange House Field until the First World War. After two years at the town's cricket pitch at Stobhill (1919\u201320), the Olympics moved to Mount Haggs Field until 1939, and then back to Grange House Field after the war until the end of the games in 1958.  In 1730, a racecourse was built for horse racing, which was used until 1854, when the racetrack was replaced with St. George's Hospital.  The town was the start point of the Morpeth To Newcastle Road Race. It was held annually on New Year's Day from 1902 to 2004, when insurance and policing costs became prohibitively high, and winners included Commonwealth champion Jack Holden and Olympic medallist Mike McLeod.  Landmarks   The historical layout of central Morpeth consisted of Bridge Street, Oldgate Street and Newgate Street, with burgage plots leading off them. Traces of this layout remain: Old Bakehouse Yard off Newgate Street is a former burgage plot, as is Pretoria Avenue, off Oldgate. The town stands directly on what used to be the Great North Road, the old coaching route between London and Edinburgh.  Carlisle Park is located on the southern bank of the River Wansbeck in Morpeth. The park has the William Turner Garden, one of the only four floral clocks in England, a statue of Emily Wilding Davison, as well as other facilities and attractions. Morpeth's Mafeking Park, at the bottom of Station Bank, was unsuccessfully put forward by locals to be listed as the smallest park in the world in the Guinness Book of Records.

It is located in the north-east of the county, about 17 mi (27 km) north of Newcastle upon Tyne. The town developed from a Roman settlement called Morpeth Camp. It is thought that the name Morpeth comes from a corruption of the name of the Roman port town of Moricares, which was situated on the opposite bank of the River Wansbeck. The town has a long history. A charter from 1158 indicates that the town was already well established by the 12th century. At that time, the town was known as Mortuath and it was granted to Roger de Merlay by Henry II. The town was granted a weekly market and an annual fair. The town was the site of a battle in 1644 during the English Civil War. In the aftermath of the Battle of Marston Moor, the royalist forces of Charles I were forced to flee the north, and sought to cross the River Tweed into Scotland. On 4 July 1644, an army of around 2,000 royalists, led by the Earl of Leven, set out from Kelso in Scotland to cross the border. They were intercepted by a group of local Parliamentarians under the command of Sir William Fenwick. The two forces met at the village of Morpeth, and after a short battle, the royalists were defeated and forced to retreat to their headquarters in Newcastle. The town was the site of a major mining disaster in 1838. The fireclay mine at Woodhorn, to the east of the town, collapsed and flooded, killing 26 miners. The event was immortalised in a poem by Robert Louis Stevenson, who visited the town in 1878. The town was served by Morpeth railway station, which was the terminus of a branch line from Newcastle. The station was opened in 1873 and closed to passengers in 1952. The line was retained for freight use until it was closed in 1984. The town was the site of the murder of James Methven, a 45-year-old man, in January 2008. The victim was attacked and killed with a hammer by Jason Michael, a 17-year-old boy who was later found guilty of murder and sentenced to life in prison.

This fish is known for its large mouth and long whiplike tail. This species is not commonly found in the wild, with fewer than twenty sightings over 30 years of ROV operation by MBARI. Even though it has rarely been sighted, this gulper eel was chosen to be the logo for MBARI.  Distribution Saccopharynx lavenbergi occurs in the eastern Pacific Ocean.  Description The species is very similar to others in the genus Saccopharynx, featuring large mouths and long slender bodies. It is typically dark in color and has small eyes. This is probably because at the depths these eels dwell, there is little to no light from the sun. They also feature a bioluminescent organ at the tips of their long tails, the function of which is currently unknown.  Ecology It occurs at depths of . It has been hypothesized that the large mouth of the eel allows it to swallow prey much larger than itself.  While no specimens have been observed mating in the wild, observations of dead specimens have led scientists to believe that this species dies after mating, much like freshwater eels.  Taxonomy and phylogeny  In 2003, researchers from the University of Tokyo sequenced mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from specimens of Eurypharynx pelicanoides and Saccopharynx lavenbergi. After comparing the sequences from the specimens with other known sequences, they found that Eurypharynx pelicanoides and Saccopharynx lavenbergi were closely related and had mitochondrial genomes distinct from other Anguilliformes.

It was first described by D. B. right in 1978. This species is a parasite of the genus Saccopharynx, a group of copepod crustaceans. It has a worldwide distribution and is found in marine and brackish environments. The Saccopharynx lavenbergi is a small, flat, ribbon-like organism with a length of 2\u20133 mm and a width of 1.5 \u03bcm. It has two layers of cells: an outer layer of firm cells and an inner layer of flexible cells. The cell border is marked by a row of small, oval, electron-dense bodies called the \"shelf\". It has a permanent mouth part, which is located at the anterior end of the parasite. The mouth part is composed of three structures: the proboscis, the labium, and the epipodite. The proboscis is used for the penetration of the host's body and for the intake of nutrients. The labium is used for the attachment to the host and for the reception of nutrients. The epipodite is used for the movement of the mouth part. The Saccopharynx lavenbergi has no locomotory organs. It can move by the means of temporary attachment to the host's body. The sexual reproduction in the Saccopharynx lavenbergi is indirect. The gametangia are small, spherical, and oval bodies that are located near the host's body. The male gametangium is called the \"micelle\", and the female gametangium is called the \"macula\". The male gametangium releases the sperm, and the female gametangium releases the egg. The fertilized egg becomes a new individual. The Saccopharynx lavenbergi is a host for the larvae of the copepod crustacean Saccopharynx thomasi. The Saccopharynx lavenbergi is found in marine and brackish environments, where it attaches to and feeds on the copepod crustacean Saccopharynx.

Garcia (October 20, 1937 \u2013 October 15, 2013) was a Filipino lawyer and jurist who served as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines. He was appointed to the Court on October 6, 2004, by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo and retired on October 19, 2007.  Early life and career   The youngest of four children and the only son of Juan Garcia and Benedicta Castillo, both illiterates, Cancio or Cancy to his friends, was born on October 20, 1937, in the remote barrio of Concordia at Alitagtag, Batangas.  Starting his education at the P. Gomez Elementary School (Manila), and thereafter at the Arellano (Public) High School (Manila), he qualified for admission into the College of Law of the University of the Philippines.  A product of the public school system, he graduated at the UP in 1961.  He obtained a post-graduate degree in Public Administration as a government scholar from the University of Santo Tomas in 1967.  Honing his skills in the legal profession by serving as the assistant at the Macapagal Alafriz & Mutuc Law Offices, he went on to serve the government, first as Legal Office, then as Junior Presidential Staff Assistant in the Legal Office of Malacanang, and thereafter, as Solicitor in the Office of the Solicitor General, at that time headed by his former college professor, Solicitor General Estelito Mendoza.  Ripe for the judiciary after more than a decade of constant brushes with the law, he first sat at the bench as City Judge of Caloocan.  Serving for more than a decade in that capacity, and having won a Judge of the Year award, he rose to the Regional Trial Court (RTC) in Angeles City and later to the RTC in Caloocan.  Soon, then President Corazon Aquino took him back to Malacanang as Assistant Executive Secretary for Legal Affairs.  Aware that he is a Jurist at heart, President Cory appointed him to the Court of Appeals where he served for almost fourteen years until 2004, first as Associate Justice, then as Presiding Justice of that court, a position he held twice \u2013 from March 14 to July 29, 2001, and April 11, 2002, to April 8, 2003.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Far Eastern University\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Far Eastern University (Filipino: Pamantasan ng Dulong Silangan), also known simply as FEU, is a private research university in Manila, Philippines. Created by the merger of Far Eastern College and the Institute of Accounts, Business, and Finance, FEU became a university in 1934 under the guidance of its first president, Nicanor Reyes Sr.    The first accountancy and business school for Filipinos, the university, through the years, has expanded its course offerings to the arts and sciences, architecture, fine arts, education, engineering, computer studies, graduate studies, tourism and hotel management, law, nursing, and medicine. FEU has five campuses located in Metro Manila and Cavite. It offers programs from elementary, secondary, tertiary, to graduate school.  FEU Manila comprises several Institutes that offer specific programs. The accountancy program, along with its other undergraduate programs, have received the highest Level IV accreditation from the Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities Commission on Accreditation (PACUCOA). The Commission on Higher Education (CHED) has also granted it as a Center of Development in Business Administration and a Center of Excellence for Teacher Education.  Since its establishment in 1928, FEU has produced national artists, business tycoons, ambassadors, justices of the Supreme Court and other judicial bodies, technocrats in private and government sectors, finance wizards, acclaimed physicians, nurses, educators, theater and media luminaries and so many others in different fields of expertise.  History The Far Eastern University was founded in November 1933 when the Far Eastern College and the Institute of Accounts, Business, and Finance (IABF) merged. Far Eastern College, founded in 1919 by Vicente K. Fabella (the first Filipino CPA), Nicanor Maronilla-Seva, Francisco Africa, Pedro Cortez, and Salvador Unson, had been a liberal arts college in Quiapo; while the IABF had been established (originally under the name Institute of Accountancy) by Francisco Dalupan Sr. and Nicanor Reyes Sr., then head of the Department of Economics at the University of the Philippines, with a number of other prominent educators in 1928. IABF had been originally predominately used by night students, and the new University, which was supported by the tuition provided by its students rather than government grants, soon demonstrated that a private university was financially sustainable in the Philippines.  In the early 1930s, FEU was housed in a converted tobacco factory (La Oriente Fabrica de Tabacos y Compania; boundary of Quiapo and Sampaloc district lots) already present on the  property lot owned by Sulucan Hill subdivision. Due to the widening of the street that became Quezon Blvd., the original building designed and built by Architect Pablo Antonio Sr. (National Artist for Architecture) was demolished and had to be rebuilt on a bigger scale on what is the present campus of FEU.  In 1934, the Institute of Law was founded. Two years later, the Institute of Technology was founded, with Fransisco Santana its first dean. In April 1938, the FEU Junior College was opened in Lingayen, Pangasinan.  Nicanor Reyes Sr. was the first founding president of the university, which spent its early years establishing several of its institutes, including those of Law and Technology. Reyes Sr. commissioned Architect Pablo S. Antonio Sr., his brother in law and husband of his sister Marina del Rosario Reyes-Antonio, who would later be titled as National Artist under the National Artist of the Philippines awards, to construct the main building for the school. In 1939, the Nicanor B. Reyes Sr. Hall, which would later house the main library at third level and Institute of Accounts, Business and Finance, opened. Two other buildings by Antonio, the Girls\u2019 High School Building and Boys High School Building, followed in 1940 and 1941, by which year FEU had 10,000 registered students, with an international student population of 400. Then Philippine President Manuel L. Quezon hailed and called FEU \"the best non-sectarian institution in the country.\"  In 1941, FEU also had the first ROTC quartermaster and ROTC finance units in the Philippines. During the American colonial period FEU ROTC was notable for having the first Coastal Artillery unit in the Philippines. During World War II, FEU cadets fought in Bataan with the Second Infantry Division. FEU constituted the majority of cadets who received armor training. These cadets were trained to operate the American M5 light tank. At the time that the FEU's coast artillery unit was formed, the Philippine Army's Coast Artillery was equipped with the 155mm GPF gun. During the Philippine\u2013American War, the Philippine coast artillery had one 150mm Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez gun. It is said that of all the Philippine colleges whose students and alumni volunteered for military service at the outbreak of the Pacific War in 1941, FEU men formed the greatest number.  In 1942, the Far Eastern University campus was used as a multi-functional facility by the Imperial Japanese Army Transportation Corps. It was later used as the Prisoner of War Bureau for the Japanese Army.  During World War II, the campus was occupied by the Imperial Japanese Army as their base. The main building sustained bullet damage while the other three buildings (Girls High, Boys High, and the old Technology Building) did not.  Nicanor B. Reyes Sr. having been killed during the Japanese occupation, Hermengildo B. Reyes was appointed the second president of the university when it reopened in 1945.  The university was re-opened in October 1945 despite the use of most of its facilities by the American forces until their departure in May 1946, the post-liberation years saw the renaissance of FEU with its massive expansion of facilities aimed at meeting the demands of modern and relevant education in the country and the increasing student population. FEU was once named as the \u201cLargest University in Asia\u201d, in the early 1950s when its enrollment passed near 50,000 students.  Thereafter, FEU continued to expand, with the opening of the Science Building and the establishment of the Institute of Medicine and the School of Nursing. In 1955, the FEU Hospital was inaugurated. Humanities were introduced in 1959, and in 1970 the Institute of Architecture and Fine Arts opened. Also in 1970, the for-profit status of the Institute of Medicine, School of Medical Technology, FEU Hospital and the Student Health Service Clinic was altered, when these were converted into the Far Eastern University \u2013 Nicanor Reyes Medical Foundation, a non-stock, non-profit educational foundation.  In 1989, Nicanor Reyes Jr. introduced substantial revitalization to FEU that took place over a number of years, with renovation and modernization of facilities and grounds and upgrading of the university's educational standard. This resulted in the accreditation of the Institute of Arts and Sciences, the Institute of Education, and the Institute of Accounts, Business and Finance, and, in the mid-1990s, the deregulation of the university by the Commission on Higher Education. The auditorium was upgraded to accommodate modern stage productions and the new twice-monthly presentations by local and international artists established by the President's Committee on Culture. The university also prioritized publication, launching a number of scholarly journals, and began networking with other institutions nationally and abroad.  After careful study of the technology program, the administration in 1992 decided to phase it out in favor of a computer technology program forged with the East Asia Computer Center, Inc. which offered degrees in computer science and certificate courses.  In 2010, FEU established the Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management and the FEU Makati campus, which started its operations by June of the same year. FEU Makati offer master's degree program in Business Administration and Baccalaureate programs in Accountancy, Accounting Technology, Information Technology and Business Administration.  Corporate  The Far Eastern University, Incorporated () is a domestic non-sectarian educational institution founded in June 1928 and was registered and incorporated with the Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission on October 27, 1933. On October 27, 1983, the university extended its corporate life to another 50 years. The university became a listed corporation in the PSE on July 11, 1986. It has been noted as the leading proprietary university in the Philippines.  The company operates through three segments: education, real estate and investment activities. Its geographical segments include Manila, Makati and Cavite.  The university's major subsidiaries include: Far Eastern College \u2013 Silang, Inc. (FECSI), East Asia Computer Center, Inc. (EACCI), Fern Realty Corporation (FRC), FEU Alabang, Inc. and FEU High School, Inc. Similar to the university, FECSI, EACCI, FEU Alabang, Inc. and FEU High School, Inc. were established to operate as educational institutions offering general courses of study. In April 2016, FEU entered into a share purchase agreement to acquire an initial 80% of Roosevelt College, Inc.  In 2019, FEU has entered into a joint venture with the Technological Institute of the Philippines to launch Edustria, a senior high school in Batangas.  University emblems  The university seal  The FEU Coat of Arms depicts a Sarimanok holding a kalasag. Inside the kalasag is an 8 pointed star with a bamboo scroll under it, inscribed with the baybayin letters \u201cKKK\u201d. Meanwhile, the university seal has the Coat of Arms housed inside a green ellipse with gold outline, surrounded with the university's name in baybayin-inspired font and the IABF's founding year at the bottom.   The logo and font were designed by Galo Ocampo, the Father of Philippine Heraldry.  FEU is one of the first universities in the country to be established by a Filipino. Thus, in 1961, the university wanted to showcase the Sarimanok-inspired coat of arms, as proposed by former Institute of Arts and Sciences Dean Alejando Roces; for it projects the nationalistic spirit upon which the university was founded. It also serves as the link between the past and present.  The eight pointed star in the kalasag represents the 8 original institutes: Institute of Accounts, Business and Finance, Institute of Education, Institute of Arts and Sciences, Institute of Technology, Institute of Law, Institute of Medicine, Institute of Nursing and Institute of Graduate Studies.  The \"KKK\" inscription means Katotohanan (Truth), Kagandahan (Beauty), and Kabutihan (Goodness).  The university colors  Green and Gold are the university's official colors. Green is for hope, representing Rizal's \"Fair hope of the Fatherland\" while Gold represents the golden opportunity for the university to serve the youth and her alumni to serve the country.The university mascot  The tamaraw is the mascot of every FEU athletic team. Hence, it is the nickname of every FEU student (Tams). Known scientifically as \u201cBubalus mindorensis\u201d, it is a rare animal found only in the island of Mindoro. Symbolically enough, the tamaraw is one of the most intelligent, pugnacious and aggressive of our animal species just as the university is known for its advanced, progressive policy in contemporary education.  The university mace  The mace is the symbol of the office of the university president. It is used on every formal events.  Manila Campus FEU's campus is noted for a number of historical Art Deco buildings preserved from the first half of the 20th century. Among the buildings on FEU's campus complex, five by late Ar. Pablo S. Antonio Sr., garnered recognition in 2005 from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), who bestowed the Asia Pacific Heritage Award for Cultural Heritage on the university for \"the outstanding preservation of its Art Deco structures.\"The buildings include the Nicanor B. Reyes Sr. Hall, the Admissions Building, the Architecture and Fine Arts Building, the Administration Building, and the Science Building. The Cultural Center of the Philippines also recognized the historical legacy of the buildings with a marker. Other historical buildings on the campus include the 1950s FEU Chapel and the Arts Building, which represent the International Style.  The university maintains various facilities, such as an electronic library, various types of laboratories, an auditorium, audio-visual and multimedia rooms, technology-based gate security and enrollment system, and gymnasiums.  Due to  FEU's mission to preserve and care for the environment, the university has a green and eco-friendly campus landscape and is famously called as the \"Oasis of the University Belt\".  History   During the 1930s, there was a heavy influence of American culture especially in the field of technology and construction that was reflected in the lives of the Filipinos. Concrete and steel were used by the Americans and was found to be the suitable materials for the tropical environment. These were materialized by Arch. Pablo S. Antonio Sr. in creating the FEU campus buildings that reflected both the university's and the country's vision and showed his personal transition from Art Deco to the International Style. The buildings were constructed between the years 1939 to 1950.  Heritage Buildings of FEU Manila Campus  Nicanor B. Reyes Sr. Hall The Nicanor B. Reyes Sr. Hall, named after the founder of the FEU, is a long, low-rise U-shaped building facing Quezon Boulevard beside the Alfredo Reyes Hall. The building was constructed in 1939 by National Artist Arch. Pablo Antonio. The distinct character of the massive fa\u00e7ade are the sets of protruded vertical volumes located on both ends of the structure.  Attention to details is another design focus of the architecture of Pablo S. Antonio Sr. The heavy influence of Art Deco in his architectural style is seen even in transitional elements like the stairs. The outdoor stairs that joins the walkway at the second floor has layers of thin concrete slabs that swirl in waves above the rigid geometry of the handrail.  The physical envelope of the building is one of the examples of classic Philippine Art Deco emphasizing the play on geometric forms.  Administration Building  The FEU Administration Building was also designed by Arch. Antonio Sr. a decade after the Nicanor B. Reyes Sr. Hall. It is located at the opposite end of the campus quadrangle that features a fa\u00e7ade with geometric architectural details, horizontal windows, and a balcony that extends into a viewing deck at the second floor to observe the activities in the quadrangle. The Administration lobby has floor tiles made of Carrara Marble, the same material used by Michelangelo in his mother and child sculpture La Pieta and also used in New York's Grand Central Station.  It houses the works of many known Filipino artists, most of them in the Art Deco era. One work is a mural done by Antonio Gonzales Dumlao, which conveys the university's mission; while Italian sculptor Francesco Ricardo Monti did a bas-relief on the lobby depicting the history of the Philippines. The Art Deco-inspired FEU Auditorium can be found inside the Administration Building.  Architecture and Fine Arts Building  The building is one of the twin edifices flanking the Administration Building. It is the third building designed by Arch. Antonio Sr., still in the Art Deco Style. Constructed in 1941, it used to house the Boys' High School, which was originally in the basic education program of the university. It also used to house the Law and Nursing programs before being handed to the IARFA. Admissions Building Built in 1940, the Admissions Building is the mirror image of the Architecture & Fine Arts Building. The building was initially used by the Girls' High School, and in 1983, became home to the Institute of Medicine. In 2015, the building has been renovated and changed its name from FEU-East Asia College Building to the FEU Main Building, which was formerly used  by FEU-EAC students.  Science Building The seven-story building erected in 1950 was the last designed building by Arch. Antonio Sr. in what is considered a transition of style between Art Deco and the post World War 2 International Style. In 1990, an earthquake caused structural damages to the building making it necessary to demolish the top two floors. By the late 2013, a sixth floor was added. The building now houses the Department of Medical Technology, Psychology, Biology and Mathematics.  Auditorium   FEU's Auditorium is designed by Pablo Antonio Sr., National Artist for Architecture, in 1949. It was regarded as the first \"Cultural Center of the Philippines\", and also, the very first fully air-conditioned auditorium in the country which can accommodate 1000 spectators. The Auditorium was home to renowned orchestras. It featured dances from Manila Ballet Academy, New York City Center Ballet, and Martha Graham \u2013 an American dancer and one of the twentieth century revolutionary artists. It also became the venue of major theatrical productions like Bastien and Bastienne \u2013 created by two National Artists, Nick Joaquin (on words) and Cesar Legaspi (on scenic designs).In addition, it was in FEU where Sarah Joaquin\u2013actress, writer, director, and former Head of the Drama Department\u2013showcased her talents through presentation of classic and contemporary plays. To this date, the auditorium upholds this legacy by accommodating more notable performances from artists here and abroad.  SCA Chapel   Another masterpiece is within campus is the Student Council Association (SCA) Chapel. Inaugurated on the 8th of December 1957, the SCA Chapel is where religious activities of faculty, personnel, and students are held. Its interior features a mural by Carlos \u201cBotong\u201d Francisco, proclaimed National Artist in 1973 and discoverer of Angono Petroglyphs (which is the oldest known work of art in the Philippines). His painting 14 Stations of the Cross encompasses 260 degrees of one's visual range. The SCA Chapel's fa\u00e7ade is the richly colored tile mosaic of Our Lady of Fatima by Vicente Manansala, also a National Artist who developed the transparent cubism technique apparent in this piece of art.  Nicanor B. Reyes Sr. Memorial Square  In the middle of the campus rests this landmark and favorite backdrop for picture-taking in the campus. Erected in commemoration of the university's 40th anniversary, it consists of a 65-foot flagpole on a platform surrounded on all sides with brass sculpture, also done by Manansala, which interprets the late founder's philosophy of education. It represents the professional disciplines offered by the university.  FEU Library   Located on the second and third floors of the Nicanor Reyes Hall, the Library has a collection of books that falls under Circulation, Reserve, Reference, Filipiniana, and Periodical sections. These can easily be accessed using the Online Public Access Catalog (OPAC) of FEU, its online database of all its print and multi-media resources. The Electronic Library is also available to provide members of the academic community highly effective learning experiences and services through the web and internet technologies as an extension of the services of the conventional library.  The Philippine Association of Academic Research Librarians, Inc. (PAARL) honored the library with the Outstanding Academic/Research Library Award during the PAARL 2012 Awards. The FEU library was recognized for its outstanding contribution to academic and research librarianship and library development along with leadership in regional library management, education and training, information and documentation services.  Academics  Far Eastern University offers 24 undergraduate programs, 17 graduate degree programs, and a law school through its seven institutes, while the Institute of Technology offers 9 undergraduate programs leading to engineering and computer studies. The university offers secondary, post-secondary, and certification courses as well. Since 2020, FEU Manila holds extension programs in its Cavite campus   The university runs on a semestral academic system. An academic year starts in the second week of August and ends in May. The university is supervised by the Board of Trustees, which is made up of academic practitioners and specialists from various disciplines.  Students who wish to study in the university must pass the College Entrance Exam (FEUCAT). However, due to the COVID-19 global pandemic, since SY 2020-2021, the FEUCAT is replaced by the FEU Student Placement for Admission to College Education (SPACE), wherein academic performance in Grades 11 and 12 are the basis for admissions.  Grading system  An FEU student's final grade for a course generally comes in the form of a letter, which is a summary of their performance in the formative and summative assessments.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Absalon-class frigate\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Absalon class are frigates of the Royal Danish Navy, commissioned in 2005. The two ships in the class may be described as a hybrid between a frigate and military transport ship with multiple role capabilities, with the capacity to be transformed from a combat ship with the firepower of a traditional frigate to a hospital ship within a day.  Design The class is based on a frigate-like design, but built with an internal multipurpose deck (flex deck) and a stern vehicle ramp. The ships can serve as command platforms for a staff of 75 persons (naval or joint staff) with a containerized command and control centre, transport and base of operations for a company-sized landing force of some 200 soldiers with vehicles. Alternatively, the flex deck can be used for mine-laying operations with a capacity of some 300 mines, or be fitted out for mine-clearing operations and launch and recover mine detecting and clearing equipment via a retractable gantry crane, adjacent to the stern vehicle ramp, which also is used for launching and recovering the fast landing craft. Furthermore, the flex deck can support a containerized hospital or simply transport a number of ISO standard containers or some 55 vehicles, including up to seven MBTs. The ships can carry two landing craft, personnel (LCPs) (Storebro SB90E), two rigid hull inflatable boats and two EH101 helicopters.  The ships have been designed by a joint team from The Royal Danish Navy (RDN), the Danish Defence Acquisition and Logistics Organization (DALO) and a group of contractors, primarily Odense Maritime Technology (OMT) to the Royal Danish Navy's requirements for a multi-mission frigate-like ship with an emphasis on flexibility.  The ships are built to the naval standards of Det Norske Veritas (DNV GL), an international certification body and classification society, heavily utilizing STANAG.  The design is built with the aim of a large margin for growth over life-cycle, to a relatively low cost of ownership, with open architecture for ease of upgrades, with a high degree of automation allowing smaller crews, and utilizing StanFlex modules that can be shared across several ship classes in service with the Royal Danish Navy.  The hulls were built in highly competitive commercial shipyards using the latest development in the industries shipbuilding technology and cost-effective production procedures and processes. The outfitting and integration of sensor, communication and weapons systems was primarily carried out \"in-house\" by the RDN and DALO.  The standard weapons of the Absalon class can be supplemented through the use of StanFlex mission modules. A special weapons deck (nicknamed the 'Bathtub') is designed with five StanFlex module slots. Because of the Bathtub's position, only missile-firing weapons modules can be installed.  History The ships were named after two brothers, Esbern Snare and archbishop Absalon, who led the naval campaigns in the 12th century against the Wends, a group of pagan Slavs in northern Germany.  Production started at Odense Steel Shipyard on 30 April 2003, with the lead ship Absalon laid down on 28 November of that year. Esbern Snare followed on 24 March 2004; they were both launched later that year. They were delivered on 19 October 2004 and 17 April 2005 respectively, and commissioned on 10 January 2005 and 17 June 2005. At this point they had the StanFlex modules installed, but would have to wait until 2007 for full operational capability, with the installation of the 35mm CIWS, Mk32 torpedo launchers and Seagnat/SRBOC decoy systems.  Among other upgrades the two ships of the Absalon class were fitted with the newer Terma Scanter 6002 to replace the Scanter 2001 in 2020.  For political reasons, the ships were originally launched as \"Flexible support ships\" to avoid antagonising Russia after the end of the cold war. On the 16th of October 2020, both ships were reclassed as ASW-frigates. Both ships will be upgraded with towed array sonars in addition to the existing, hull-mounted sonar and the Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk helicopters will be equipped with dipping sonars, sonobuoys and torpedoes. This upgrade is expected to complete in 2026.

The ships are assigned to the Royal Netherlands Navy's Surface Ship Squadron (Enfdienst der zee\u00ebr op het land, or EDL) which is a part of the Royal Netherlands Navy's I Regiment. The I Regiment is responsible for the operation of all surface vessels in the Royal Netherlands Navy. The Absalon-class frigates are designed to fight in the low-intensity conflicts that the Royal Netherlands Navy expect to occur in the near future. The Royal Netherlands Navy's 2005 Defence White Paper states that the navy expects to fight battles at a distance from the Dutch mainland in the future, with the navy's role being to protect the sea lines of communication and to deploy forces from the sea. To achieve this, the navy requires a number of multi-purpose frigates that have a large endurance, are well-armed and have a good anti-submarine warfare capability. The Absalon-class frigates are meant to fill this role. The Absalon-class frigates are multi-purpose frigates. The ships are designed to fight in the low-intensity conflicts that the Royal Netherlands Navy expect to occur in the near future.

A close binary, it consists of a white dwarf and low-mass star orbiting each other in 2 hours 49 minutes. The stars are close enough that the white dwarf strips material off the other star, creating an accretion disc that periodically ignites with a resulting brightening of the system. These result in an increase in brightness lasting around a day every 37 days. Brighter outbursts, known as superhumps, last 5-20 days and take place every 194 days. The properties of TU Mensae have been difficult to calculate, as the calculated mass ratio between the two stars mean there should not be superhumps.  TU Mensae has an apparent magnitude of 18.6 when quiescent, brightening to 11.8 in outburst. The companion star has been calculated to be a red dwarf of spectral type M4V, and the white dwarf has an estimated mass around 80% that of the Sun.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Ptolemais in Phoenicia\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Ptolemais was an ancient port city on the Canaanite coast in Palestine region. It was also called Ptolemais in Canaan (or Akko, Ake, or Akre in Canaanite Language. It was an Ancient bishopric, which became a double Catholic titular see.  In the Middle Ages, it was known as Acre amongst some Western European crusaders, who started a new, militantly Latin chapter there.  History  Greek historians refer to the city as Ake (), meaning \"cure.\" According to the Greek myth, Heracles found curative herbs here to heal his wounds. Josephus calls it Akre. The name was changed to Antiochia Ptolemais () shortly after Alexander the Great's conquest, and then to Ptolemais, probably by Ptolemy I Soter, after the Wars of the Diadochi lead to the partition of the kingdom of Alexander the Great and its inclusion first into the Egypt-based Lagid empire, then in the Seleucid Empire.   Around 37 BC, the Romans conquered the Hellenized Phoenician port-city called Akko. It became a colony in southern Roman Phoenicia, called Colonia Claudia Felix Ptolemais Garmanica Stabilis. Ptolemais stayed Roman for nearly seven centuries until 636 AD, when was conquered by the Muslim Arabs. Under Augustus, a gymnasium was built in the city. In 4 BC, the Roman proconsul Publius Quinctilius Varus assembled his army there in order to suppress the revolts that broke out in the region following the death of Herod the Great.  During the rule of the emperor Claudius there was a building drive in Ptolemais and veterans of the legions settled here. The city was one of four colonies (with Berytus, Aelia Capitolina and Caesarea Maritima) created in ancient Levant by Roman emperors for veterans of their Roman legions. As a result, Claudius granted the title \"Colonia Claudia Felix Ptolemais Garmanica Stabilis\".  The city was a center of Romanization in the region, but most of the population was made of local Phoenicians and Jews: as a consequence after the Hadrian times the descendants of the initial Roman colonists were no more speaking Latin and were fully assimilated in less than two centuries (however the local society's customs were Roman).  In 66 AD Gessius Florus, the Roman Procurator of Judea, conducted an initial massacre of the Jews living in the city. The next year Vespasian, the Roman military commander (soon to be emperor), accompanied by his son Titus, moved from Akko-Ptolemais to suppress the Jewish rebellion in Galilee.  In 130 AD the port of Ptolemais was used as a base for the Roman Legions setting forth to suppress the Bar-Kochba revolt. After the destruction of Jerusalem many Jews settled in Ptolemais, that was losing its original Phoenician characteristics since Augustus times.  In 190 AD Christianity started to be important in the city: Clarus, the Bishop of Ptolemais, participated in a council of Christian leaders. Ptolemais grew to be an important port in the eastern Mediterranean sea of the Roman empire. After Hadrian times Ptolemais was the commercial center & port of Jewish Galilee and was starting to be no more part of Phoenicia.  In 351 AD Constantius Gallus suppressed a Jewish rebellion and did a small massacre of the Jews of Akko-Ptolemais (who were starting to be the majority of the city's population and rejected Roman domination).  Under Byzantine control the city lost importance and around 636 AD was conquered by the Arab Amr ibn al-Aas. Following the defeat of the Byzantine army of Heraclius by the Muslim army of Khalid ibn al-Walid in the Battle of Yarmouk, and the capitulation of the Christian city of Jerusalem to the Caliph Umar, Ptolemais was ruled  by the Rashidun Caliphate beginning in 638 AD.  Christianity center  Ptolemais was an important center of early Christianity in the region. Saint Paul visited the city at the end of his third missionary journey.  Towards the end of the third century, Ptolemais was a predominantly Christian city, but with a large Jewish community. An unidentified visitor from Italy reported that in the sixth century the city had beautiful churches. Indeed, an important discovery was made in 2011: a Byzantine church in the middle of Crusaders' \"San Giovanni d'Acri\" (as was called Ptolemais in the Middle Ages).  Ecclesiastical History  Bishops of Ptolemais in Syria  The Apostle Paul, returning from his trip to Macedonia and Achea, landed at Tyre, and from there sailed to Ptolemais, where he stayed some days with the local Christian community (Acts 21.7).  Ptolemais became of suffragan of the Metropolitan Archbishopric of Tyre.  The first bishop known is Clarus, who in 190 AD attended a Council meeting which saw some bishops of Phoenicia and Palestine to deal with the issue of the date of the Easter feast. But we must go back to the fourth century to find the next Bishop, Enea, who took part at the first Council of Nicaea in 325 AD and at the Synod held in Antioch in 341 AD. Nectabus was one of the fathers of the first Ecumenical Council of Constantinople in 381 AD. Between the 4th and 5th centuries lived Bishop Antiochus, opponent of John Chrysostom. Helladius participated in the first Council of Ephesus in 431 AD. Paul took part in the Council held at Antioch of 445 AD to judge the work of Athanasius of Perrhe and at the Council of Chalcedon of 451 AD. In 518 AD Bishop John signed a Synodal letter against Severus of Antioch and the Monophysite party. Finally, the last known Bishop of Ptolemais is George, who attended the second Council of Constantinople in 553 AD.  It faded after Islam was established in Greater Syria in the 7th century by the first Caliphs, conquering the Sassanid satrapy.   CRUSADERS In the 12th century, the Crusaders started all over in their Kingdom of Jerusalem. From 1107 - 1190 AD including a Latin Catholic Diocese of Acre. Then reconquered in the 13th century for another further decades of Christian domination with Jewish communities peacefully living together.  Titular sees  Long after the Crusader states had perished, the Catholic church nominally restored the see (linked to the Acre succession) as a titular see, actually twice, in different rite-specific branches.  Latin titular see   Established by nominal restoration as Episcopal Titular bishopric of Ptolemais (Latin) / Tolemaide (Curiate Italian)  Gained 'territory' (i.e. apostolic succession) in 1870? from the suppressed Episcopal Titular bishopric of Acre (Akka), but suppressed circa 1895  Restored and promoted in 1909 as Titular archbishopric of Ptolemais (Latin) / Tolemaide (Italian)  Demoted back in 1925 as Episcopal Titular bishopric of Ptolemais (Latin) / Tolemaide (Italian; in 1926 renamed as Tolemaide di Fenicia)  Renamed in 1933 as Titular bishopric of Ptolemais in Ph\u0153nicia (Latin) / Tolemaide di Fenicia (Italian) / Ptolemaiden(sis) in Ph\u0153nicia (Latin adjective)  It is vacant since  decades, having had the following incumbents, so far of the (mostly fitting) Episcopal, i.e. lowest) rank (with an archiepiscopal exception) :  Carolus Ludovicus Hugo, Norbertines (O.

The city was founded in the 3rd or 2nd century BC and was named in honor of the Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt. The city was located in the northern Beqaa Valley, between the cities of Antioch and Damascus, on the border between the Seleucid Empire and the Ptolemaic Kingdom. The city was mentioned by several ancient writers, including Pliny the Elder, Appian, and Strabo. Although the city was founded in the 2nd or 3rd century BC, the site had been inhabited since at least the Neolithic period. In the 3rd century BC, the region was occupied by the kingdom of Syria, which was subsequently conquered by the Egyptians under Ptolemy I Soter. The city was captured by the Seleucids in the 2nd century BC, and became the seat of a governor. The city also had a temple dedicated to the gods of the underworld, which was used for the burial of the city's elite. The city was destroyed in the 1st century BC, and its site remained abandoned until it was reoccupied in the 6th century AD. The city was mentioned by the historian Procopius, who described it as a flourishing city. The city was eventually abandoned again, and its site was forgotten until it was discovered and excavated in the 20th century. The site of Ptolemais in Phoenicia was identified in the 20th century AD, and excavation of the site began in the 1970s. The city was located on a hill in the northern Beqaa Valley, between the modern cities of Damascus and Homs. The city was surrounded by a wall, and had a theater, a temple, and a number of houses and streets. The city's ruins are located in a modern-day Syrian military base.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 31753457}

Biography Born Hensman Anthony, the sobriquet Firingee (The foreigner of European origin) was used colloquially as a reference to his Portuguese origins. Although not much is known of his early life, Anthony arrived in Bengal sometime in early 19th century and subsequently came to settle in Farashdanga, in the town of Chandannagar in West Bengal.  He married a Hindu Brahmin widow named Saudamini and was deeply influenced by Bengali culture and language, as well as the Hindu religion. Eventually, Anthony came to learn the language and composed a number of noted religious songs in devotion to the Goddesses Kali and Durga. He is noted for his Agamani Songs, celebrating the return of Goddess Durga to her parents home that marks the Bengali Autumn festival of Durga Puja. Anthony is also noted for his literary face-offs in Kavigans, or Bard's duels, with a number of noted Bengali composers including Bhola Moira, Ram Basu and Thakur Singha. Anthony also helped construct a temple to Goddess Kali in the Bowbazar locality of Central Calcutta known as 'Firinghi Kalibari'. His wife Saudamini was burnt to death, for being a widow and remarrying Anthony, who was a foreigner.  In popular culture  Books The first reference to Anthony Firingee is a novel by Madan Bandopadhay titled Kabiyal Anthony Firingee.   Films  A 1967 Bengali film by director Sunil Bannerjee portrayed the life and works of Anthony, and had Bengali actor Uttam Kumar in the title role. The film was noted for its music, composed by Anil Bagchi & lyrics by Gouri Prasanna Majumdar among others and earned Uttam Kumar an Indian National Film Award for Best Actor in 1968.  A 2014 adaptation by director Srijit Mukherji titled Jaatishwar featured the life of Anthony from a retrospective view but with a modern-day context. Jaatishwar also received an Indian National Film Awards in 2014, in four categories, including Best singer and Best Music Director.  References   Miah S and Islam S.

The city was founded by the Etruscan king Porsenna around 500 BC. The name Vetulani is believed to derive from the name of the ethnos, or people, called the Vetules, who inhabited the area in the 6th century BC. The city was one of the main centers of the Etruscan Dodecapolis, a group of twelve cities which dominated the region. Other cities in the Dodecapolis were: Arezzo, Cortona, Perugia, Deruta, Potniae (in the modern comune of San Casciano dei Pagni), Arretium (Arezzo), Clusium (Chiusi), Clevsin (modern day Volterra), Cortona, Perugia, and Assisi. The city is best known for its late 4th century BC bronze Tablet of the Iguvine Tablets, a collection of bronze tablets discovered in the 19th century, which bear the only known Etruscan calendar, and are one of the few Etruscan sources which can be definitely dated. The tablets also contain the only known example of a bound ritual text in Etruscan. The Vetulani were known to have worshipped the gods Tinia, the supreme god of the Etruscan pantheon, and Culsans, a god who appears in the company of Tinia in the Tablet of the Iguvine Tablets.

Although Leinster had been appearing regularly in The Smart Set and pulp magazines such as Argosy and Short Stories for three years, \"The Runaway Skyscraper\" was his first published science fiction story (or more accurately, scientific romance, since Hugo Gernsback had yet to coin the phrase \"science fiction\").  Gernsback would reprint the story in the third issue of his science fiction pulp magazine Amazing Stories in June 1926.  Plot summary \"The Runaway Skyscraper\" concerns Arthur Chamberlain, an engineer who works in a midtown Manhattan office building called the Metropolitan Tower.  When the sun suddenly begins moving backwards in the sky, setting rapidly in the east, he is the only one to realize what is actually happening: a flaw in the rock beneath the building has caused it to subside, but instead of moving in space, the building is falling backwards into the past.  When the subsidence finally ends, the building is located several thousand years in the past, and its 2000-odd inhabitants find themselves stranded in pre-Columbian Manhattan.  Chamberlain also realizes that the same seismic forces that caused the building to drop back into the past can also be used to return it to the present, but that doing so will require several weeks of intensive work by the building's inhabitants, and in the meantime they must concentrate on feeding themselves.  Chamberlain convinces the president of a bank on the first floor that he can return them to the present, and together they are able to organize the other inhabitants into hunting and fishing parties.  Two weeks later, Chamberlain is ready to implement his plan.  He forces a jet of soapy water into an artesian well beneath the building, and this allows the pressure that has built up in the rock to be released.  The building travels forward in time again, returning to the exact moment when it began to travel into the past.  Reception  In 2013, Amazing Stories described it as \"monumental\" and \"an ageless story of adventure and endurance\". Reason noted that the building \"travels backwards in time for no particular reason\".  References  External links The Runaway Skyscraper at Project Gutenberg.

King released the album, \"Saw Mill Man\", in 2005. He was aged 79 at the time of recording. A song from the album entitled \"Outlaw\" was included in the score of Gus Van Sant's 2007 film, Paranoid Park. \"Saw Mill Man\" drew comparisons to Johnny Cash's American Recordings series. King's baritone voice and acoustic guitar have been praised as possessing a raw and affecting quality. The narratives of the songs dealt with characteristic country themes such as poverty, broken relationships, and murderous outlaws. Although his opportunity to record a full-length album came late in life, Cast King had previously recorded for Sun Records in 1955. With his band, The Country Drifters, he cut around a dozen songs at this time. It was musician, Matt Downer, who located King and encouraged him to come out of a long musical retirement and record. Downer also played electric guitar throughout \"Saw Mill Man\". The record was met with favourable reviews from Rolling Stone, Arthur Magazine, Mojo, and No Depression among other publications. King was preparing a second collection of songs when it was discovered that he was suffering from cancer. He died at the age of 81 on December 13, 2007.

The DCPU-16 could also load external programs and data using the required standards which would have allowed the community to make their own DCPU-16 emulators.  Development In December 2011, Markus Persson announced that he was going to be stepping down as the lead developer of Minecraft, and that he would be working on another project.  Mojang CEO Carl Manneh said in an interview with Edge Online that Mojang was committed to supporting a new project that Persson was developing along with another game created by other developers in their company. After winning a special award from BAFTA in March 2012, Persson revealed that there were three different projects he was developing, but he had yet to come to a decision in terms of which one he was committed to working on.  A few days later in an interview with PC Gamer magazine, Persson announced that he was working on a space-themed game that was inspired by the television show Firefly and the video game Elite.  The first details of this game were released in an April Fool's parody website called \"Mars Effect\", a play on Mass Effect and alluding to the lawsuit by Bethesda Softworks over trademark infringement. A few days later Persson announced that he had chosen a real name for the game and that he had made some progress on its development. Although it is not immediately obvious how to pronounce the game's name and a large variety of suggestions were proposed, Persson has said that he pronounces it as \"ten to the see,\" but that \"people can pronounce it however they want\".  On October 13, 2012, the first video gameplay of 0x10c was released by Persson on the game's website. On October 26, 2012, the first multiplayer test was uploaded to the website from Twitch.TV. In an April 2013 interview with Polygon, Persson stated that 0x10c development was hit by creative road block and would be put on hold. Persson also said that the game is \"ways off\" and that he would be expanding the team, bringing on one other developer to \"make sure the game gets made.\" On August 13, 2013, Persson confirmed in a live stream that 0x10c was indefinitely shelved, adding that the game could potentially be made in the future, if another Mojang employee were interested in continuing its development.

Soundtrack  On September 15, 2014, Daniel Rosenfeld (C418), who also composed the music for Mojang's previous game, Minecraft, released the soundtrack for 0x10c on his Bandcamp page, which consists of two tracks, \"0x10c\" and \"0\".   Pricing 0x10c was expected to be the first Mojang game with a monthly fee for online play in multiplayer mode (but no recurring fee for single player mode). Persson said that this was because of the cost to \"emulate all computers and physics even when players aren't logged in.\" It is unknown if there was to be a private multiplayer mode.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Disruptive selection\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Disruptive selection, also called diversifying selection, describes changes in population genetics in which extreme values for a trait are favored over intermediate values. In this case, the variance of the trait increases and the population is divided into two distinct groups. In this more individuals acquire peripheral character value at both ends of the distribution curve.  Overview  Natural selection is known to be one of the most important biological processes behind evolution. There are many variations of traits, and some cause greater or lesser reproductive success of the individual. The effect of selection is to promote certain alleles, traits, and individuals that have a higher chance to survive and reproduce in their specific environment. Since the environment has a carrying capacity, nature acts on this mode of selection on individuals to let only the most fit offspring survive and reproduce to their full potential. The more advantageous the trait is the more common it will become in the population. Disruptive selection is a specific type of natural selection that actively selects against the intermediate in a population, favoring both extremes of the spectrum.  Disruptive selection is inferred to oftentimes lead to sympatric speciation through a phyletic gradualism mode of evolution. Disruptive selection can be caused or influenced by multiple factors and also have multiple outcomes, in addition to speciation. Individuals within the same environment can develop a preference for extremes of a trait, against the intermediate. Selection can act on having divergent body morphologies in accessing food, such as beak and dental structure. It is seen that often this is more prevalent in environments where there is not a wide clinal range of resources, causing heterozygote disadvantage or selection against the average.  Niche partitioning allows for selection of differential patterns of resource usage, which can drive speciation. To the contrast, niche conservation pulls individuals toward ancestral ecological traits in an evolutionary tug-of-war. Also, nature tends to have a 'jump on the band wagon' perspective when something beneficial is found. This can lead to the opposite occurring with disruptive selection eventually selecting against the average; when everyone starts taking advantage of that resource it will become depleted and the extremes will be favored. Furthermore, gradualism is a more realistic view when looking at speciation as compared to punctuated equilibrium.  Disruptive selection can initially rapidly intensify divergence; this is because it is only manipulating alleles that already exist. Often it is not creating new ones by mutation which takes a long time. Usually complete reproductive isolation does not occur until many generations, but behavioral or morphological differences separate the species from reproducing generally. Furthermore, generally hybrids have reduced fitness which promotes reproductive isolation.  Example  Suppose there is a population of rabbits.  The color of the rabbits is governed by two incompletely dominant traits: black fur, represented by \"B\", and white fur, represented by \"b\". A rabbit in this population with a genotype of \"BB\" would have a phenotype of black fur, a genotype of \"Bb\" would have grey fur (a display of both black and white), and a genotype of \"bb\" would have white fur.  If this population of rabbits occurred in an environment that had areas of black rocks as well as areas of white rocks, the rabbits with black fur would be able to hide from predators amongst the black rocks, and the rabbits with white fur likewise amongst the white rocks.  The rabbits with grey fur, however, would stand out in all areas of the habitat, and would thereby suffer greater predation.  As a consequence of this type of selective pressure, our hypothetical rabbit population would be disruptively selected for extreme values of the fur color trait: white or black, but not grey. This is an example of underdominance (heterozygote disadvantage) leading to disruptive selection.  Sympatric speciation It is believed that disruptive selection is one of the main forces that drive sympatric speciation in natural populations. The pathways that lead from disruptive selection to sympatric speciation seldom are prone to deviation; such speciation is a domino effect that depends on the consistency of each distinct variable. These pathways are the result of disruptive selection in intraspecific competition; it may cause reproductive isolation, and finally culminate in sympatric speciation.  It is important to keep in mind that disruptive selection does not always have to be based on intraspecific competition. It is also important to know that this type of natural selection is similar to the other ones. Where it is not the major factor, intraspecific competition can be discounted in assessing the operative aspects of the course of adaptation. For example, what may drive disruptive selection instead of intraspecific competition might be polymorphisms that lead to reproductive isolation, and thence to speciation.  When disruptive selection is based on intraspecific competition, the resulting selection in turn promotes ecological niche diversification and polymorphisms.  If multiple morphs (phenotypic forms) occupy different niches, such separation could be expected to promote reduced competition for resources. Disruptive selection is seen more often in high density populations rather than in low density populations because intraspecific competition tends to be more intense within higher density populations.  This is because higher density populations often imply more competition for resources. The resulting competition drives polymorphisms to exploit different niches or changes in niches in order to avoid competition. If one morph has no need for resources used by another morph, then it is likely that neither would experience pressure to compete or interact, thereby supporting the persistence and possibly the intensification of the distinctness of the two morphs within the population. This theory does not necessarily have a lot of supporting evidence in natural populations, but it has been seen many times in experimental situations using existing populations. These experiments further support that, under the right situations (as described above), this theory could prove to be true in nature.  When intraspecific competition is not at work disruptive selection can still lead to sympatric speciation and it does this through maintaining polymorphisms. Once the polymorphisms are maintained in the population, if assortative mating is taking place, then this is one way that disruptive selection can lead in the direction of sympatric speciation. If different morphs have different mating preferences then assortative mating can occur, especially if the polymorphic trait is a \"magic trait\", meaning a trait that is under ecological selection and in turn has a side effect on reproductive behavior. In a situation where the polymorphic trait is not a magic trait then there has to be some kind of fitness penalty for those individuals who do not mate assortatively and a mechanism that causes assortative mating has to evolve in the population. For example, if a species of butterflies develops two kinds of wing patterns, crucial to mimicry purposes in their preferred habitat, then mating between two butterflies of different wing patterns leads to an unfavorable heterozygote. Therefore, butterflies will tend to mate with others of the same wing pattern promoting increased fitness, eventually eliminating the heterozygote altogether. This unfavorable heterozygote generates pressure for a mechanism that cause assortative mating which will then lead to reproductive isolation due to the production of post-mating barriers. It is actually fairly common to see sympatric speciation when disruptive selection is supporting two morphs, specifically when the phenotypic trait affects fitness rather than mate choice.  In both situations, one where intraspecific competition is at work and the other where it is not, if all these factors are in place, they will lead to reproductive isolation, which can lead to sympatric speciation.  Other outcomes  polymorphism  sexual dimorphism  phenotypic plasticity  Significance   Disruptive selection is of particular significance in the history of evolutionary study, as it is involved in one of evolution's \"cardinal cases\", namely the finch populations observed by Darwin in the Gal\u00e1pagos. He observed that the species of finches were similar enough to ostensibly have been descended from a single species.  However, they exhibited disruptive variation in beak size.  This variation appeared to be adaptively related to the seed size available on the respective islands (big beaks for big seeds, small beaks for small seeds).  Medium beaks had difficulty retrieving small seeds and were also not tough enough for the bigger seeds, and were hence maladaptive.  While it is true that disruptive selection can lead to speciation, this is not as quick or straightforward of a process as other types of speciation or evolutionary change. This introduces the topic of gradualism, which is a slow but continuous accumulation of changes over long periods of time. This is largely because the results of disruptive selection are less stable than the results of directional selection (directional selection favors individuals at only one end of the spectrum).  For example, let us take the mathematically straightforward yet biologically improbable case of the rabbits:  Suppose directional selection were taking place. The field only has dark rocks in it, so the darker the rabbit, the more effectively it can hide from predators. Eventually there will be a lot of black rabbits in the population (hence many \"B\" alleles) and a lesser amount of grey rabbits (who contribute 50% chromosomes with \"B\" allele and 50% chromosomes with \"b\" allele to the population). There will be few white rabbits (not very many contributors of chromosomes with \"b\" allele to the population). This could eventually lead to a situation in which chromosomes with \"b\" allele die out, making black the only possible color for all subsequent rabbits.  The reason for this is that there is nothing \"boosting\" the level of \"b\" chromosomes in the population. They can only go down, and eventually die out.  Consider now the case of disruptive selection. The result is equal numbers of black and white rabbits, and hence equal numbers of chromosomes with \"B\" or \"b\" allele, still floating around in that population. Every time a white rabbit mates with a black one, only gray rabbits results. So, in order for the results to \"click\", there needs to be a force causing white rabbits to choose other white rabbits, and black rabbits to choose other black ones. In the case of the finches, this \"force\" was geographic/niche isolation. This leads one to think that disruptive selection can't happen and is normally because of species being geographically isolated, directional selection or by stabilising selection.

Disruptive selection occurs when the sex ratio is uneven, causing a deviation from the expected sex ratio, which is 50 percent male and 50 percent female. The sex ratio is the proportion of one sex to the other in a population. In disruptive selection, the actual sex ratio does not stay constant. Instead, the ratio oscillates between two levels. The population's gender composition shifts over time from one extreme to the other and then back again. In a population with even numbers of males and females, the gender composition should stay the same from one generation to the next. In a population with disruptive selection, the gender composition changes every generation. In the first generation, the ratio may be 60 percent male and 40 percent female. In the next generation, the ratio may shift to 70 percent male and 30 percent female. In the third generation, the ratio may be 80 percent male and 20 percent female. This pattern of shifting back and forth between two levels continues in subsequent generations. The cause of disruptive selection is usually a combination of a preference for one sex over the other and a shortage of the preferred sex. For example, in a population of birds, the females may prefer to mate with the males who have the brightest plumage. If there are not enough brightly colored males to go around, the females may be forced to mate with males who have duller plumage. Over time, this can cause the population to become more and more male-heavy, as the females prefer the males who are the most colorful and the males with the least colorful plumage have the highest fitness.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1275975}

The civil parish also includes the villages of Campsall and Sutton, and has a population of 4,381, increasing to 4,625 at the 2011 Census.   The northern boundary of the parish is marked by the River Went, while the Great North Road forms the western boundary.  History  Little is known about Norton until it was recorded in the Domesday Survey of 1086 when it probably had a population of 100 who were solely concerned with agriculture. During the medieval period that followed, Robin Hood was associated with Barnsdale Forest to the west whilst the nearby village of Campsall grew in importance, gaining a chartered market and Norman church. However, Norton gets few mentions in any surviving records from this time.  At a later date, Norton Priory was developed on the banks of the River Went but this never grew to be particularly significant and was subsequently demolished following the dissolution of the monasteries in 1588. In 1745, Mary Ramsden of Norton died and left 50 shillings to the poor of Norton and \u2018several estates\u2019 to the master and fellows of Catherine Hall, Cambridge. Thus a Cambridge College became the Lord of the Manor of Norton and a handsome manor house was built in the village. In the 1800s the Forrester's Arms and the School Boy Inn were both established to serve the local population which would still be devoted to agriculture.  Following the industrial revolution and the expansion of the railways, a station was opened in Norton in 1855 on the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway\u2019s Knottingley Branch. At the start of the 20th century there were rumours of the development of collieries at nearby Kirk Smeaton and Askern. As Norton was located between the two, a number of rows of red brick terraces were erected speculatively to house the anticipated influx of miners. Subsequently, Askern Colliery was opened in 1910 and a new red brick pub, the Royal Hotel, was built in Norton to serve the colliers of the village.  Throughout the 20th century small areas of housing have been built throughout the village and many of the original stone cottages with their long gardens have been demolished, and infilled with housing. The Manor House was pulled down in the 1970s and other older buildings have suffered the same fate since then, e.g. Hope Farm was demolished in 2002 to be replaced a small development of private housing.  Village today  In the 21st century Norton serves as a commuter village for people working in the nearby towns such as Doncaster and Pontefract.

The M18 motorway passes through the parish, to the east of the village. The village lies on a natural aquifer, and has a number of springs, two of which are in the village centre. One of these is marked by a stone basin, which was once a horse trough. This feature gave the village its name, Norton, which means \"North town\" in Old English. The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book, as \"Nortone\". The parish church is dedicated to Saint Nicholas, and is a Grade II* listed building. It dates from the early 12th century, with later renovations. A school was built in the village in 1876, and was originally called the Norton Board School. It became a primary school in the late 1940s, and was renamed the Norton County Primary School in the 1970s. In the 1980s it became the Norton Comprehensive School, a secondary school with a sixth form.

Biography He was born in the hamlet of Apalachin located in the Town of Owego, New York on April 26, 1830.  Tracy was a lawyer active in Republican Party politics during the 1850s. He was a member of the New York State Assembly (Tioga Co.) in 1862.  He served in the Union Army during the Civil War, and commanded the 109th New York Infantry Regiment. At the Battle of the Wilderness in May, 1864, he was able to rally his men and hold the Union line. For his actions he subsequently was awarded the Medal of Honor. His citation reads: Tracy \"seized the colors and led the regiment when other regiments had retired and then reformed his line and held it.\" Later that year, he became commandant of the Elmira prisoner of war camp, before being appointed Colonel of the 127th Infantry, U.S. Colored Troops, on August 23, 1864. Tracy was discharged from the volunteer service on June 13, 1865. On January 18, 1867, President Andrew Johnson nominated Tracy for appointment to the brevet grade of brigadier general of volunteers, to rank from March 13, 1865, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on February 21, 1867.  He resumed the practice of law after the war, and became active in New York state politics. He was United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York from 1866 to 1877. In December 1881, he was appointed by Governor Alonzo B. Cornell to the New York Court of Appeals to fill the vacancy caused by the appointment of Judge Charles Andrews as Chief Judge after the resignation of Charles J. Folger. Tracy remained on the bench until the end of 1882 when Andrews resumed his seat after being defeated by William C. Ruger in the election for Chief Judge.  In 1875, Tracy defended the well-known preacher Henry Ward Beecher during his highly publicized trial for adultery.  Tracy was noted for his role in the creation of the \"New Navy\", a major reform of the service, which had fallen into obsolescence after the Civil War.  Like President Harrison, he supported a naval strategy focused more on offense, rather than on coastal defense and commerce raiding.  A major ally in this effort was naval theorist Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan, who had served as a professor at the new Naval War College (founded 1884).  In 1890, Mahan published his major work, The Influence of Sea Power upon History, 1660\u20131783\u2014a book that achieved an international readership.  Drawing on historical examples, Mahan supported the construction of a \"blue-water Navy\" that could do battle on the high seas.  Tracy also supported the construction of modern warships. On June 30, 1890, Congress passed the Naval Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1891 (also known as the Battleship Act of 1890), a measure which authorized the construction of three battleships. The first three were later named , , and . The battleship  was authorized two years later.  Tracy's wife and child died in a fire at their residence in Washington, DC in 1890.  In the 1896 presidential election, Tracy was a presidential elector for William McKinley and Garret Hobart.  After leaving the Navy Department, Tracy again took up his legal practice. In 1896 he defended New York City Police commissioner Andrew Parker from accusations of negligence and incompetence by fellow commissioner Theodore Roosevelt in a performance that significantly embarrassed Roosevelt. He also helped end the Venezuela Crisis of 1895 by assisting Venezuela in negotiating a settlement to their boundary dispute with Great Britain.  Tracy was the Republican candidate to be the first Mayor of Greater New York City when the five boroughs consolidated in 1898. He came in third behind Democrat Robert A. Van Wyck and Seth Low of the Citizens' Union, winning 101,863 of the 523,560 votes cast in the election of 1897.  Tracy was the president of the New York State Agricultural Society in 1897 and 1898, during which time he invited Van Wyck to attend the society's annual fair.  On April 3, 1900, seven men from the International Banking and Trust Company were elected as directors of the North American Trust Company. They included president Oakleigh Thorne of the International, as well as Tracy.

In some cultures, sheep's trotters are seen as a delicacy, and are thus often expensive.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 51554931}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Mortal Kombat (comics)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Mortal Kombat comic books series included the official Mortal Kombat comics by Midway and a licensed adaptation series by Malibu Comics that was published in 1994-1995. There are thus two different lineups of Mortal Kombat comics: the tie-ins published by Midway (some of them made by Mortal Kombat co-creator John Tobias) and DC Comics that closely followed the storyline of the games, and the Malibu series, which took a few liberties with the source material.  Comics published by Midway Games The Midway comics were tie-ins published to coincide with the launches of Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat II, and Mortal Kombat 4. They offered insight into the backstory to each of the games as well as providing exposition of events occurring before each game.  Mortal Kombat Collector's Edition  Mortal Kombat Collector's Edition Midway's comic book prologue to the original Mortal Kombat was only released by mail order when the original arcade version was released in 1992. The mail order deal was displayed during the attract mode of the game. (This mode of advertising was also used in Mortal Kombat II.) The comic book would later be sold normally around the country, although it was close to impossible to get a copy outside of the United States. The comic was written and illustrated by John Tobias, the early Mortal Kombat series' designer artist. The final few pages offer character profiles for the seven playable characters in the original MK and the boss, Goro.  The comic begins by filling in the backstory of Shang Tsung, the Great Kung Lao, and Goro, whose victory in Mortal Kombat had meant a new dark era for the tournament. In the present day, where Liu Kang receives permission from Master Wu to fight in Mortal Kombat. Two weeks later, in Hong Kong, he boards a boat that will take him to the tournament island. Johnny Cage is also seen there, reassuring his agent and personal secretary who are afraid for his safety and the legitimacy of the tournament. Meanwhile, Kano and some members of his Black Dragon attempt to evade Sonya Blade, Agent Beran (whose name is not revealed here), and a man who is apparently Jax, as well as the rest of a U.S. Special Forces unit. Chased by Sonya, Kano leaps aboard the boat, all in accordance with his plan to loot all the riches he can find from Shang Tsung's palace.  In the mountains of rural Japan, Shang Tsung issues a challenge to Raiden, God of Thunder, inviting him to compete and reminding him that the tournament will be fought in his domain and under his rule. Back on the boat, Kano is trying to intimidate Cage and a fight breaks out, during which Liu Kang takes down Kano's associates. Sub-Zero watches the scene from above, unaware of the lurking spectre of Scorpion, who ambushes him from behind. Scorpion vows to kill Sub-Zero just as Sub-Zero killed Scorpion exactly two years ago. However, he states he is no mere murderer and, instead of killing the Sub-Zero on the boat, he will do so at the tournament. Sub-Zero says Scorpion is a fool to spare his life.  At the island, after a day of practice and training, Shang Tsung and Goro welcome the participants in the tournament and introduce the latest entrant, Sonya Blade, who had been trying to track Kano down to the island, but was captured and brought in by guards. Shang Tsung says that not only does Sonya's life depend on her performance, but so do the lives of her accompanying unit, who have also been captured. Goro then announces the start of the tournament and the story ends with the caption \"To be continued...at an arcade near you!\"  Mortal Kombat II Collector's Edition Midway's comic book prologue to Mortal Kombat II was published by mail order during the release of the arcade version, much like with the original game's comic. Likewise, the second comic book reflects the events that were raised in the game and was also written, penciled, and colored by John Tobias. 100 million copies are said to had been printed.  The story begins with Johnny Cage recounting the events of the first game's final moments. He explains that Shang Tsung unleashed a horde of warriors on the Earthrealm fighters following Liu Kang's victory over Goro; and that Kano, Sonya, and himself were rushed by Goro at The Pit. Suddenly, an explosion knocked out the bridge from underneath them and everyone fell. Cage was saved, however, by Raiden, who informed him that Liu Kang had killed Shang Tsung and the island, which was held together by Tsung's presence, is self-destructing. Raiden further elaborates that Liu Kang has already escaped and, following the battle with Shang Tsung's army, Sub-Zero was killed by Scorpion, who then burst into flames and burned to ash before Raiden's eyes. The ensuing explosion apparently knocked Cage out and the next thing he recalls is seeing a U.S. military vessel. As it turns out, Cage has been telling the story to a disbelieving Jax and Lt. Steve Beran (a reference to Mortal Kombat series art director Steve Beran), who is more open to the story considering Cage has recounted the story five times with exactly the same details each time. Jax does not believe Cage's story on account of a distress signal from Sonya pinpointed to where they found Cage and because he thinks Sonya would never fight alongside Kano, even if, as Cage says, she had no choice. He nevertheless releases Cage due to lack of evidence.And   Meanwhile, in Outworld, Shao Kahn is being addressed by King Gorbak, who laments his son, Goro's, apparent death and places the blame on the shoulders of Shang Tsung, who is alive in Outworld. Gorbak calls for Tsung's death, but Kahn gives the him one chance to impress upon him why he should not personally slay him. Tsung instantly comes up with a plan: to lure the Earthrealm warriors to Outworld by breaching the dimensional gate and challenging them to Mortal Kombat. Only this time, the tournament will take place in Outworld and will be against the wishes of the Elder Gods. Kahn consults a Shadow Priest for advice and is told that due to the plan being against the wishes of the Elder Gods, it is impossible to clearly foresee the outcome. Should Kahn be victorious, his power will be unmatched and he will live for eternity. If the plan fails, however, Kahn will face eternal damnation. Gorbak says that if Tsung is to live then he will offer the services of Kintaro. As Shang Tsung's presence on Earthrealm no longer exists, Shao Kahn gives him a new physical form, one that is much younger in appearance. Kahn then sends Kitana, Mileena, Baraka, Kintaro, and Shang Tsung to destroy the Shaolin Monastery.  At the Special Forces base, a recording is received from Sonya and Kano that confirms Cage's story as true. Jax decides to make a trip to Hollywood to track down Cage. In China, Liu Kang has returned to Shaolin to find it ruined. The apparent sole survivor of the attacks, Kung Lao, appears from the shadows and sides with his friend by offering his word that he will fight against Outworld. At that moment, a Lin Kuei hover jet lands and a man in a suit claiming to be Sub-Zero hands Liu Kang his calling card. Liu Kang states that he saw Sub-Zero die and this man cannot possibly be the same person, but the ninja says he is the brother of the original Sub-Zero and remarks that his brother's unwillingness to adapt to technological change within the Lin Kuei is what made him obsolete. He shows the monks surveillance pictures the Lin Kuei took of Shang Tsung who appears to be searching for Cage, and the three then decide to journey to Hollywood. Cage is on set, filming a commercial for \"Cage Cologne.\" (The director's name is \"E. Boon\" and bears resemblance to the franchise co-creator of the same name whilst the cameraman looks like fellow co-creator John Tobias.) At this point, Shang Tsung and the Outworld warriors sent by Kahn, flanked by numerous Masked Guards, arrive through a portal in the studio. As Jax and Beran demand to see Cage, he is blasted through the wall right in front of them and a massive fight breaks out. Sub-Zero's hover jet arrives about this time, being piloted by Smoke and a red-clad Lin Kuei member. Kung Lao and Liu Kang join the fight on Jax's side. Sub-Zero (now in his ninja uniform) leaps down and makes an attempt on Shang Tsung's life, but rebounds off an invisible Reptile. Before Reptile can kill Sub-Zero, however, Scorpion intervenes and attacks Reptile, saying he will defend Sub-Zero as penance for killing his brother. Before anything else can happen, though, Raiden arrives to stop the conflict. Shang Tsung now makes his challenge before returning to Outworld with his allies, leaving the Earthrealm warriors with the choice of accepting the challenge or forfeiting. Raiden informs Liu Kang that forfeit would weaken Earthrealm's standing with the Elder Gods and Liu Kang must accept the challenge. Jax is reluctant to join the tournament but is spurred on when Cage reveals Beran has been killed by Mileena. Sub-Zero also offers to compete. Raiden tells the gathered group of Jax, Liu Kang, Kung Lao, Johnny Cage, and Sub-Zero to \"Prepare yourselves, Mortals\u2014for Kombat in the Outworld!\" The comic ends with the caption, \"To be continued on a game screen near you!\"  Mortal Kombat 4 Limited Edition This comic book/artbook hybrid was created jointly by artists Al\u00e9 Garza, Tomm Coker, Keron Grant, Garry Leach, Steve Pugh, and Mark Texeira. It was produced as a tie-in to the PlayStation and Nintendo 64 versions of Mortal Kombat 4, initially available as a pre-order incentive, and was later packaged with the PC CD-ROM version of the game.  Shinnok, ruler of the Netherrealm, is the first to emerge from the portal, followed by hundreds of demons, as well as the mysterious Reiko, and Scorpion, who is likely looking for another chance at life outside the Netherrealm. As Quan Chi, the one who gave Sindel the orb, discusses the success of the plan and says Tanya is to be thanked, Shinnok claims his true goal is to reach the heavens and confront the Elder Gods, and now he has that chance.  Several days later, in Earthrealm, Sub-Zero has travelled to the Temple of the Elements in China. He recalls what his elder brother, the original Sub-Zero, said: that the temple is home to an amulet designed to keep Shinnok in the Netherrealm. The amulet is protected by the elements of Wind, Earth, Water, and Fire (a reference to Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero). As Sub-Zero prepares to make peace with the elemental Gods, he sees what he believes to be a sign falling from the sky and decides to follow it after symbolically donning his mask once more out of respect not to the Lin Kuei, but to his brother. Miles away, Liu Kang quickly gets the upper hand, Kai jokes that this is easy enough for the Immortal Champion of Mortal Kombat. Suddenly, what Sub-Zero had seen falling from the sky collides with the ground near the monks. They inspect the scene and discover demons about to slit the throat of a white-haired man. Elsewhere, Sonya Blade is battling Jarek. Unable to get the upper hand over the last remaining Black Dragon clan member, Jarek escapes. Jax then contacts Sonya and tells her she is needed to investigate an interdimensional flux in southwestern China and a helicopter piloted by Johnny Cage is sent to pick her up. At the crater, Liu Kang and Kai battle the demons until Raiden shows up and destroys the demons. Raiden then explains that the man who fell from the sky is Fujin, God of Wind. He elaborates that he and Fujin are the last two remaining of Earth's Gods and that the Elder Gods have been weakened by Shinnok. He and Fujin withdraw to the Eternal Palace to formulate a plan of attack, after telling Liu Kang and Kai they must go to Edenia. Just as Kai is lamenting the impossibility of such a task, the helicopter carrying Sonya and Cage arrives. Sub-Zero too shows up to offer his help, correctly guessing that his brother may have played some part in Shinnok's return. Sonya uses Outer World Investigation Agency technology to open a portal to Edenia. On the other side, they are all greeted by Quan Chi, who welcomes the Earthrealm Warriors to a \"Mortal Kombat like you've never seen before.\" The comic ends with the caption, \"To be continued in Mortal Kombat 4.\"  Comics published by Malibu Comics  Comics published by DC Comics  Mortal Kombat VS DC Universe: Beginnings This short comic was illustrated by returning John Tobias and written by John Vogel, another of the original four co-creators of the Mortal Kombat franchise. It is the backstory comic for the 2008 game Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe, merging the worlds of Mortal Kombat and the DC Universe.  Mortal Kombat X: Blood Ties DC Comics announced a prequel comic book series for Mortal Kombat X that \"will feature many favorite characters and the next generation of Kombatants\" as being written by Shawn Kittelsen with interior art by Dexter Soy and covers by Ivan Reis. The series debuted in January 2015.  Blood Ties begins several years after the end of the \"Netherrealm War\", when Shinnok led Netherrealm in an attempt to conquer Earth and the other realms in the wake of Shao Khan's death. Shinnok was defeated and his undead armies pushed back, save for a number of dead warriors who were restored to life. Meanwhile, Outworld fell into a civil war as Mileena was overthrown by her warchief Kotal Kahn. In the Himalayan wilderness, Kenshi and his son Takeda flee from members of the Red Dragon and are saved by Scorpion and his rebuilt Shirai Ryu clan. Kenshi explains that he was infiltrating the Red Dragon when he was exposed, causing the group to target his son, whom he did not know he had. Kenshi leaves Takeda with Scorpion and leaves to complete his mission and find the Red Dragon's leader. Meanwhile, Kuai Liang, the younger Sub-Zero (who has also been returned to life) attacks a Red Dragon Temple in China. He enters the inner chamber only to be attacked by Kano, who has taken the Kamidogu (which are daggers in this timeline) within and scars him with it, stating that the Kamidogu are cursed.   Years later, Scorpion is approached by Raiden. After ensuring the Kamidogu is safe, he warns Scorpion of a demon from another realm that seeks to kill Earth's champions. Takeda's friend Fox is driven mad by voices: taking the Kamidogu, he is possessed by the demon and kills the rest of the Shirai Ryu, before being killed by Takeda and Scorpion. After paying their respects to the fallen, the two leave to find Raiden to seek answers. At the Sky Temple, Raiden converses with the Wind God Fujin, before using another dagger to invoke blood magic to find the demon. He discovers that they are too late and that events are already in motion. At a Special Forces base, Sonya Blade meets with Kotal Khan, Emperor of Outworld, who was captured entering Earth. Kotal explains that Mileena's resistance in Outworld is in league with the Red Dragon, and that he and his warriors are there to eliminate them. He asks for their cooperation, though Sonya refuses, and a fight ensues, but Raiden intervenes and Kotal departs, threatening to make them pay. Elsewhere, Sonya's daughter Cassie Cage, takes Jax's daughter Jacqui Briggs to what she believes to be a legal fight club, but are forced into an illegal death match against Frost. The match is interrupted by Black Dragon members Jarek and Tasia, who attempt to take Cassie and Jacqui. The two are sucked through a portal, but Cassie is able to take a picture of one of their abductors from her phone, Erron Black, one of the warriors who had been with Kotal, leaving it for Sonya. Sonya finds Cassie's phone and prepares to take her men and Johnny Cage (Cassie's father) to Outworld.  In Outworld, Kotal Khan sends his father to find Prince Goro who has disappeared while looking for Mileena. Unknown to Kotal, Goro has betrayed him and joined Mileena. Goro kills Kotal's father, driving Kotal to empower himself with his Kamidogu and face Goro personally, tearing his arms off. As Kotal and his warriors leave, they are confronted by Sonya demanding her daughter's location. Kotal denies involvement but agrees to help after Erron Black is shown to be involved. Elsewhere, Erron, Kano and the Black Dragon are taking Jacqui and Cassie to an unknown location when they are ambushed by Mavado and the Red Dragon. Kano abandons Erron who is wounded and the girls kill Mavado before being taken prisoner once more. In Earthrealm, Scorpion and Takeda near the Sky Temple and are attacked by Raiden, who is under the effects of the Kamidogu's curse. Takeda is seemingly killed, causing Scorpion to savagely beat Raiden, freeing him from the curse. Raiden saves Takeda's life and explains that following Shinnok's defeat the Elder Gods locked him away in another dimension. The Kamidogu were empowered with Blood Magic to act as the keys to his prison, and entrusted to powerful warriors by Raiden, keeping their true purpose and power hidden. Scorpion is furious at the deception. Raiden apologizes, explaining that he had not foreseen the demon corrupting the magic and cursing the blades. He informs him that all the blades are accounted for, save for one which has been stolen by Sub-Zero, who was possessed when Kano scarred him with one years earlier, and Scorpion agrees to help track him down. In Outworld, Mileena's chief advisor Reiko plots with the demon cleric Havik, who promises to grant him the power to become ruler of Outworld if he brings him the Kamidogu. Meanwhile, Sonya's team finds Erron Black who delivers a message that Reiko and Havik are waiting for them on Shang Tsung's island.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"George W. M. Reynolds\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "George William MacArthur Reynolds (23 July 1814 \u2013 19 June 1879) was a British fiction writer and journalist.  Reynolds was born in Sandwich, Kent, the son of Captain Sir George Reynolds, a flag officer of the Royal Navy. Reynolds was educated first at Dr. Nance's school in Ashford, Kent, and then attended the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He was intended for a career in the British Army, but his parents died during 1829 and, with his subsequent inheritance, he decided to quit the military and devote himself instead to literary pursuits. He left Sandhurst on 13 September 1830 and for the next few years he traveled a great deal, particularly in France, and became a naturalised French citizen. He began residence in Paris in 1834, where he started a daily English newspaper. The venture failed, and Reynolds returned bankrupt to England in 1836.  Reynolds served as editor of The Teetotaler (a weekly journal advocating teetotalism) beginning in 1840.  Writing Reynolds was a prolific writer of popular fiction starting from The Youthful Imposter, published in 1835 which was then republished later as The Parricide; or, The Youth's Career of Crime. After the publication of his first novel Reynolds then assumed the editorship of The Monthly Magazine, a position which he held between 1837 and 1838 and wrote articles under the pseudonym of \"Parisianus.\" Almost forgotten now, during his lifetime he was more read than Dickens or Thackeray; in his obituary, the trade magazine The Bookseller called Reynolds \"the most popular writer of our times\" (\"Obituary\" 600). His best-known work was the long-running serial The Mysteries of London (1844), which borrowed liberally in concept from Eug\u00e8ne Sue's Les Myst\u00e8res de Paris (The Mysteries of Paris). It sold 40,000 copies a week in penny instalments and more than a million copies cumulatively before it was issued in bound volumes, enjoying an international circulation in French, German, Italian, and Spanish translations. Although it was outlawed by the authorities, the German version achieved the status of a cult favourite on the Russian black market.  The Mysteries of London and its even lengthier sequel, The Mysteries of the Court of London, are considered to be among the seminal works of the Victorian \"urban mysteries\" genre, a style of sensational fiction which adapted elements of Gothic novels \u2013 with their haunted castles, innocent noble damsels in distress and nefarious villains \u2013 to produce stories which instead emphasized the poverty, crime, and violence of a great metropolis, complete with detailed and often sympathetic descriptions of the lives of lower-class lawbreakers and extensive glossaries of thieves' cant, all interwoven with a frank sexuality not usually found in popular fiction of the time.  The Mysteries of London, like most of Reynolds' works, was published first as a weekly penny dreadful, or \"Penny Blood\", illustrated with lurid engravings and circulating mainly among readers of limited means and education. Although Reynolds was unusual in his religious skepticism (one of the main characters in The Mysteries of London was a clergyman turned libertine) and political radicalism, his tales were intended for his mostly middle- and lower-class readers; they featured \"hump-backed dwarves, harridans and grave-robbers [who] groped past against a background of workhouses, jails, execution yards, thieves' kitchens and cemeteries. His readers could depend on him to bring in the theme of maiden virtue rudely strumpeted as often as possible.\"  Reynolds' Wagner, the Wehr-Wolf was a gothic novel which described how the title character became a werewolf after making a pact with the devil. Wagner, the Wehr-Wolf was republished in 1975 by Dover Books with an introduction and bibliography of Reynolds by E. F. Bleiler.  Reynold's novels remained in print on both sides of the Atlantic longer than those of many of his contemporaries. An 1875 edition of Reynolds's Ciprina, published in Philadelphia, lists 40 novels including Mysteries of London under the heading \"George W. M. Reynolds' Great Works\", priced between 50 cents and $1.00. The Mysteries of the Court of London, translated into Marathi as well as Urdu, remained a best-seller in India well into the twentieth century. The Marathi translation was done by K.B. Mande in the early 20th century and was titled The Secret Deeds of the Elites of London. It was very popular in the Marathi-speaking area, as is evident by numerous references to the text in early 20th-century Marathi literature.  Chartism Reynolds was also a major figure in the Chartist movement. In 1846, he founded two magazines, Reynolds' Miscellany (RM) and The London Journal (LJ). In 1849, he founded Reynolds's Political Instructor, which in May 1850 became Reynolds Weekly Newspaper, the leading radical newspaper of the post-Chartist era. It long survived him, ending publication in 1967 as the Sunday Citizen. Edwin Brett, a fellow chartist and publisher of penny dreadfuls, became a lifelong friend.  For both Reynolds's Political Instructor and Reynolds's Weekly Newspaper, between 1849 and 1856, he would write a signed editorial every week in which he gave his opinion on the pressing political matters of the day.  In 1854, he relocated to Herne Bay in Kent, where he became one of the town's Improvement Commissioners. Reynolds was an advocate of British Republicanism; much of his journalism, especially during the 1870s, \"promoted a levelling agenda against traditional social hierarchies and accentuated the difficulties of the British throne\".  Works  Novels A prolific novelist, the list of Reynolds's works is long; matters are made more complex by the fact that American publishers often attributed the authorship of various anonymously written books to Reynolds as well. Furthermore, although he is known as a penny blood author, not all of his works appeared as serialised penny instalments.  The following works have, as a result of research by E. F. Bleiler, been confirmed to have been definitely authored by Reynolds:   The Youthful Imposter  (published in 3 vols by Librarie des Estrangers in 1835)  The Baroness: A Novel   (serialised in the Monthly Magazine in 1837, under the pseudonym of \"Parisianus\")  Pickwick Abroad; or, The Tour in France   (serialised in the Monthly Magazine between 1837 and 1838)  Alfred de Rosann   (serialised in the Monthly Magazine in 1838).

Reynolds was born in Auckland in 1915. He received his education at King's College, Auckland and then at the Royal Military College, Duntroon, Australia. He graduated in 1937 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the New Zealand Army Service Corps. In 1939 he was transferred to the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) and trained as a pilot. He was posted to No. 3 Squadron RNZAF in 1940, which was then based at Wigram Aerodrome, near Christchurch. The squadron was equipped with the Short MUnless from the United Kingdom, and was being prepared for service as a maritime patrol unit in the Pacific. In September 1941, Reynolds was sent to England to attend the Royal Air Force's Staff College, at Andover, for a year. After graduating, he served in air intelligence at the Air Ministry, in London, for three years. He returned to New Zealand in January 1945, as the RNZAF's senior intelligence officer, based at its headquarters in Wellington. In 1950, Reynolds became the RNZAF's director of intelligence, based at Wigram. The following year he was appointed the service's chief of staff, and in this capacity he served as the New Zealand member of the British\u2013New Zealand\u2013United States military committee, which was responsible for the development of the hydrogen bomb. In 1954 he was posted to London as the RNZAF's air attach\u00e9 to the United Kingdom. The following year he was made a wing commander, and appointed to the directing staff of the Royal Air Force College of Air Warfare, at Manby, for three years. After a period as the RNZAF's director of operations, based at Wellington, in 1961 he was made an air commodore and appointed to the Air Force's command staff, in charge of the administration of all air force bases in New Zealand. In 1965, Reynolds became the RNZAF's vice-chief of staff, and two years later he was appointed chief of staff, in charge of the air force's 3,500 personnel. This made him the first New Zealander to hold this position. In this role he travelled widely, including to the United States, Britain, and Australia, to help form a common defence policy among the Commonwealth nations. He retired from the RNZAF in 1972, having been appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath, and was succeeded as chief of staff by Air Commodore David Crooks. After his retirement from the air force, Reynolds became the New Zealand director of the Bank of New Zealand. He also served as the honorary air commodore of No. 3 Squadron, and as the chairman of the New Zealand aerospace industry steering committee.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 4485501}

He is played by Scottish actor Kevin McKidd.  Vasser is the protagonist of the series, who begins to time travel, unable to stop or control the jumps. At the start of the series, Vasser is a reporter for the fictional newspaper the San Francisco Register, and is happily married to Katie Vasser n\u00e9e Barron of seven years with whom he has a son, Zack.  Vasser was born in San Francisco, California to Frank Vasser, a photographer, who left his wife and family on Christmas Eve 1979 when Dan was seven. About ten years before the start of the series, Vasser was engaged to Deputy District Attorney Olivia \"Livia\" Beale, who he shared an apartment with. At the same time Katie was dating Vasser's brother, Jack. When Livia was believed to have been killed in an airplane crash, Vasser developed a gambling problem. It was at this point that Katie (who had recently split-up with Jack) and Vasser became romantically involved.  Vasser begins to involuntarily time travel on his seventh wedding anniversary, at first thinking he is hallucinating. With every trip he realizes that he is 'traveling' to help change the outcome of people's lives for the better. On his travels, Vasser is helped by Livia, who he initially believes is a ghost. As the series continues he finds out that Livia is in fact a time traveler like him, who was originally from 1948 and returned home just before her plane crashed.

There are listings in all of Minnesota's 87 counties and 10 judicial districts, including 74 listings on the Mississippi River. The locations of National Register properties and districts (at least for all showing coordinates below), may be seen in a map via this link. While the National Register of Historic Places is a federal program, each listing is nominated by a state or local government. The Minnesota Historical Society is the state agency that nominates properties to the National Register. Kiosks There are three different types of kiosks, all of which are listed on the National Register: 1. Kiosks that are essentially small buildings, such as the Foshay Tower Kiosk. 2. Kiosks that are attachments to a building, such as the CenturyLink Kiosk. 3. Kiosks that are free-standing, such as the Nicollet Mall Kiosk. There are also two historic districts which contain numerous kiosks: 1. The Medtronic-Minneapolis Kiosk District, which includes the Kiosk House. 2. The Nicollet Mall Kiosk District. Buildings and structures There are hundreds of properties and districts listed on the National Register. The great majority of these are buildings and structures. There are two types of properties which are further differentiated by their historical significance: 1. Historic \u2014 A property or district that was once the site of a significant event or the home of a famous person, contains a significant structure, or is associated with a significant person or event. 2. architectural \u2014 A property or district that has special architectural or engineering significance, or is associated with a significant person or event. The most recently listed property is the The Commodore Hotel, which was listed on April 6, 2016. The most recently listed district is the W. 7th Street-Fort Road Historic District, which was listed on June 7, 2016.

Districts There are over a hundred different historic districts in Minnesota. A historic district is an area of a city or town that is listed on the National Register as being of historic significance. While historic districts can be listed on the National Register, they are not typically individually listed. There are four different types of historic districts: 1. Survey district \u2014 A district that is not of exceptional significance, but is listed on the National Register because it is the best example of a type of district or contains the best example of a type of building. 2. Site district \u2014 A district that is of exceptional significance because of its historical associations or its containing the best example of a type of building. 3. Historic-era district \u2014 A district that is of exceptional significance because it contains a significant number of buildings that are representative of a period of time or contain the work of a significant number of architects or builders. 4. Architecture district \u2014 A district that is of exceptional significance because it contains a significant number of buildings that are outstanding for their architecture or are the work of outstanding architects. There are also three districts which are listed by the state of Minnesota and are not listed on the National Register: 1. The Fort Snelling Historic District in Fort Snelling. 2. The Charles A.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Monte Titano\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Monte Titano (\"Mount Titan\") is a mountain of the Apennines and the highest peak in San Marino. It stands  above sea level and is located immediately to the east of the capital, San Marino. It was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2008 under the combined title \"San Marino Historic Centre and Mount Titano\". Inscribed under reference no. 1245 criteria iii, the two together encompass an area of 55 ha with a buffer zone of 167 ha. It encompasses Mount Titano and the other structures such as the fortification towers, walls, gates and bastions, as well as a neo-classical basilica located on it and its slopes forming a small but unique urban conglomerate.  Straddled on the ridge of  Mount Titano is the city of San Marino of the Republic of San Marino, the history of which dates from the early 4th century. According to the legend related to the Mount and its precincts, a small monastery existed on top of the Mount during the 8th century. The mountainous landscape provides excellent views of its surroundings, and its isolated location ensured the needed seclusion for San Marino to survive as a Republic over the past several centuries.  The mountain has three peaks; on each is one of The Three Towers of San Marino. Saint Marinus is always represented with Mount Titano in his hands.  Geography and environment Monte Titano is located in central San Marino (seen in maps in rough rectangular shape), to the southeast of the City of San Marino and to the north of the village of Murata, at a distance of  from the Adriatic Coast. Monte Titano looks like a rugged limestone outcrop, located only 13 kilometres (a figure of 10\u00a0km is mentioned in another reference) from the Adriatic Sea on the Apennines. Although the highest point is 739 metres above sea level, the rocky outcrop is about 200 metres in height at most. From the top of Monte Titano views of the entire nation of San Marino and further afield can be viewed scenically. The mountain gives birth to several streams, including the San Marino River, which flows down its western slope through a broad valley and flows into the Marecchia River, through Marecchia Torello and into the Adriatic Sea  away and the Cando River, born in Marano, which flows into the Adriatic coast between Rimini and Riccione Ausa. The terrain has fertile soils in Emilia Romagna plain and soft rolling hills in the Marche and Montefeltro region. The mountain dips into the calm Adriatic sea.  During the Tertiary era, the area where San Marino lies was the sea. Violent earthquakes caused major upheavals in the Earth's surface. Because of these intensive earthquakes, a mass of rock situated about  from the mountain, was lifted and slid slowly toward the Adriatic Sea. This mass of rock gave rise to various mountains, including Mount Titano. The vertebrate fossils found on the slopes of Mount Titano are mostly aquatic in origin, because of the fact this rock was once located underneath the sea in its current spot. Fossils of various fish, especially the fossils of shark teeth have been discovered on Monte Titano, with many dated to the Miocene period. The most important fossil discovery is that of a whale, which is now preserved in the Bologna Archaeological Museum.  The precincts of Monte Titano and the San Marino city experiences mild temperate climate; the maximum temperatures reported is of 79\u00a0\u00b0F (26\u00a0\u00b0C) in summer while the minimum is 19\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22127\u00a0\u00b0C) in winter. Annual precipitation varies from about 22\u00a0inches (560\u00a0mm) to 32\u00a0inches (800\u00a0mm).  Flora and fauna Set in the Mediterranean zone the vegetation is typical influenced by elevation variations. Numerous trees inhabit the mountain, including chestnuts, oaks, laburnum, cypress, fir trees and some shrubs and asparagus, typical of the driest areas, such as the territory in the Three Towers of San Marino vicinity. On the cliffs of Mount Titano is also found Ephedra Nebrodensis, a plant typical of Sicily and Sardinia.  Wildlife is represented by all classes of vertebrates and, given the characteristics of the mountainous territory, birds and mammals are the most common animals. In relation to birds, several can be mentioned such as the kestrel, barn owl, owl, tawny owl, the magpie and buzzards.  Common animal life includes roe deer, wild boar, deer, weasels, marten, porcupine, hare, hedgehogs, polecats, badgers and foxes.  Protected area Since 2008, Monte Titano was allocated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, in tandem with the historic centre of San Marino. The reason given by the Committee refers to \"witnessing the continuity of a free republic since Middle Ages. \" This heritage site include the towers, walls, gates and bastions of the City of San Marino, the Basilica di San Marino of the nineteenth century, some convents of the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries, the eighteenth century Teatro Titano Theatre and the Palazzo Pubblico of the nineteenth century.  Culture  The layout of the Mount Titano presents three peaks, each crowned by ancient towers named Guaita, Cesta and Montale, with triple fortifications that enclose the capital city. Each tower, in turn, has a metal vane fixed on it which is in the shape of an ostrich plume, (\"perhaps a pun on the Italian penne, meaning \"plumes\") which is attributed to the name of the mountains. Those three towers are represented in the coat of arms in the central part of the National Flag (horizontal white and blue) of the country (which has a width to length ratio of 3 to 4). The capital city is set on the western side of Mount Titano. An urban network of roads links the fortresses.

It is the highest peak of the Gran Sasso e Monti della Laga National Park, the largest national park in Italy. The mountain has an altitude of 2,406 metres (7,997 ft) above sea level and is the highest peak in the Abruzzo region. It is also the highest non-volcanic peak in the Apennines. The peak is located in the municipality of Cosenza dei Pii, in the province of Teramo, about 50 kilometres (31 mi) from the city of Teramo. The northern side of the mountain is characterized by high and steep cliffs, while the southern side is instead formed by a gentle and wide slope, which allows an easy climb to the top. The mountain is the site of an annual endurance race, the \"Assolo Monte Titano\". The race starts at the bottom of the mountain, in the nearby town of Cosenza dei Pii, and the winner is the runner who first reaches the top. Since the beginning of the 20th century, a metallic statue of the Christ the Redeemer, a copy of the one in Rio de Janeiro, has been placed on the top of the mountain as a symbol of peace between the Christian and the Muslim worlds. The statue, placed on the top of a pedestal, is 6 metres (20 ft) high, with its arms outstretched and facing the city of Baghdad, in Iraq. The project to erect the statue was conceived by the Italian entrepreneur Michele Ferrero, of the Ferrero company, to whom the Iraqis had offered the same area of land in their country to erect the statue as a symbol of peace. The summit of the mountain can be reached by a hiking trail which starts from the city of Cosenza dei Pii and climbs through the \"La Salizzona\" area, then leads to the \"La Pedra\" area, from which the final climb to the top of the mountain begins. The total length of the trail is about 7 kilometres (4.3 mi), with a total climb of about 1,200 metres (3,900 ft) of elevation.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 7157834}

It lies about  north-east of Melton Mowbray and  south-west of Grantham on the main A607 road. The parish population was 967 in 2011.  Geography The parish is the site of Waltham television transmitting station, which serves most of the East Midlands. Apart from the main village, the parish includes the village of Thorpe Arnold, just to the north-east of Melton. To the south-east is Stonesby, which is nearer to the  transmitter. The village is on a ridge, which has an escarpment close to the north-west that dramatically overlooks the Vale of Belvoir.  History One of the earliest mentions of this place is in the Domesday book where it is listed among lands given to Hugh de Grandmesnil by the King. There were  of meadow and land for 11 ploughs. It was valued at six pounds.  The village had a railway station 1 mile/1.6 km north of the village, which opened in 1883 on a branch line from Scalford, but was used only occasionally by passenger trains for special occasions, such as events at Croxton Park. There was no regular passenger service. The line was owned by GNR and used mainly by iron ore trains from quarries near Knipton, Eaton and Branston. The remains of the line are still visible. The station was a terminus. There was a trailing junction with the Eaton Branch Railway (opened in 1884) to the south west of the station. The ore trains came off this branch and then reversed before travelling to Scalford.  Quarries Two iron-ore quarries were operated at Waltham briefly in the 1880s. One was begun in 1882 by the Waltham Iron Ore Company either side of what is now the A607 north of the village. The other was further north in the northern angle between the A607 and the narrow road to Eaton. Both quarries closed in 1885. Each had a horse-drawn narrow-gauge tramway which carried the ore to the railway. The more southerly of the two quarries may have possessed a steam locomotive. Nothing can now be seen of the two quarries except (in 1992) the stone parapets of a bridge under the A607. This was used by the more southerly of the two tramways.  There was a quarry close to the railway, which was worked for limestone between 1931 and 1941.  Pet nutrition Waltham is also known for its connection with Mars (previously Masterfoods UK), and the Waltham Centre for Pet Nutrition which carries out research into the effect of diet on cats, dogs and horses (for Spillers).  Amenities The parish church, dedicated to St Mary Magdalene, is built of a local, honey-coloured ironstone used for several churches in the district (e. g. at South Croxton). On 27 February 2008, the church spire was badly damaged by the 2008 Lincolnshire earthquake. The top  of it had to be rebuilt, at an estimated cost of some \u00a3100,000. The work was completed in 2009. The church contains some Norman features, with much building from about 1300. It was restored and extended in 1850, when the supervising architect was George Gilbert Scott.  The Church of England primary school has a pre-school attached. It received a grade of outstanding in a 2011 inspection by Ofsted.  The one surviving pub in the village, the Royal Horseshoes, is in Melton Road. It was refurbished in 2010 and also provides meals and accommodation.

The shell generally being painted in a sand color or light brown, with surviving examples being refurbished in the 1943 order with green paint and a frontal bracket. The liner is quite different from its army cousin, instead of being attached by seven rivets around the sides of the shell, the liner is affixed using sheet metal wire from the circumference band holding the pads to the very top of the shell by means of a single rivet. The liner features four smaller leather pads as opposed to the three on the M26. Behind said pads are four paltry sized felt pads to give cushioning between the pad and liner band.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Alexandru Al. Ioan Cuza\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Alexandru Al. Ioan Cuza (also known as Alexandru A. Cuza, A. A. Cuza, or Sa\u0219a Cuza; 1862 or 1864 \u2013 April 4, 1890) was a Romanian aristocrat and politician. He was the eldest of the sons adopted by Domnitor Alexandru Ioan Cuza and his consort, Elena Rosetti-Cuza. Public opinion and historians generally agree that both Cuza brothers were Cuza's natural sons from his mistress Maria Catargi-Obrenovi\u0107, though another hypothesis has them as born to Maria from her liaison with Cezar Librecht, the Postmaster General and spy chief. His biological and his adoptive mother both belonged to the boyar aristocracy of Moldavia. Through Catargi, Alexandru and Dimitrie were half-brothers of Milan I Obrenovi\u0107, the King of Serbia, and of General Radu Catargi. During his brief political activity, Alexandru was repeatedly described as a Russophile or more specifically an agent of the Russian Empire, resembling in this Maria and her father, Costin Catargi.  Alexandru Ioan's reigned marked the first political union between the two Danubian Principalities (Moldavia and Wallachia), which was to form the Kingdom of Romania in 1881. In the 1860s, his father made a conscious attempt at establishing a Cuza dynasty\u2014this, together with his dissolute lifestyle, helped coalesce the \"monstrous coalition\", which fought to have him deposed. When Alexandru Ioan was ousted and replaced with Carol of Hohenzollern (February 1866), Alexandru Al. Ioan followed him into exile, graduating from the University of Paris. He settled back in Romania after his father's death, attempting to create a current of opinion against Carol, and being presented, by his partisans and adversaries alike, as a competitor for the throne. He rallied with the opposition Conservatives for the election of January 1888, winning a Third-College seat in the Assembly of Deputies, whereupon he resigned. In mid 1888, he helped journalists Alexandru Beldiman and Grigore Ventura found an anti-Carlist newspaper, Adev\u0103rul.  Alexandru stepped back from politics shortly after the peasant riots of 1888, having been identified as their inspiration, and possibly co-instigator. Also that year, when Dimitrie Cuza died, he was the last surviving direct male heir of the Cuzas, and the sole landowner of Ruginoasa. Gravely ill and allegedly incapable of fathering children of his own, he disinherited his adoptive mother, while favoring his young wife, Maria Moruzi. After his death in Madrid, the Cuza estate, including Ruginoasa manor, passed through his widow onto the Moruzis and the Br\u0103tianus. The dying out of the Cuza line remained contested into the 20th century, with inaccurate reports that \"Cuza's son\" was leading the peasants' revolt of March 1907, and with new claimants appearing in both France and Chile.  Biography  Adoption scandal According to most accounts, Sa\u0219a Cuza and his younger brother Dimitrie were born from a liaison between the Domnitor and his mistress Maria, the Moldavian boyaress, previously married into the House of Obrenovi\u0107. Their maternal grandfather was Costin Catargi(u), a great landowner and Moldavian separatist, who had opposed Cuza's arrival to the throne in 1859. Through Maria, the two Cuza boys were also half-brothers of Milan, the future Serbian King, who was Maria's eldest son. On the Catargi side, their uncle Alexandru and cousin Alexis were noted career diplomats, while another uncle, George, was Domnitor Cuza's aide-de-camp.   Through Alexandru Ioan, Sa\u0219a descended from a matrimonial alliance of Moldavian boyars and Phanariotes. His paternal grandmother, Sultana Cozadini, was the niece of Moldavian Prince Nicholas Mavrogenes. The Cozadini family was an Italo\u2013Greek branch of the Bolognese Gozzadinis\u2014who had owned parts of Kea under the Duchy of the Archipelago, afterwards merging into the Phanariote community of Istanbul. Memoirist and social historian Radu Rosetti, who was also a relative of Cuza's wife Elena \"Doamna\", claims that there was no actual blood connection between Alexandru Ioan and his purported sons. He believes that their actual father was Maria's other lover\u2014Cezar Librecht, the Belgian-born Postmaster General of Romania. By 1864, Librecht was running a quasi-legal secret service, which ran political errands for Cuza Sr.  Domnitor Cuza's legal marriage, meanwhile, produced no heirs. He and Elena were virtually separated by 1866, and, sources attest, were at best friendly to each other. Maria Obrenovi\u0107 was allegedly a Russophile, like her father, and rumors spread that, as part of this political intrigue, she intended to have Cuza divorce her rival. Instead, the boys were successively adopted by Elena: Alexandru on  (that is, shortly after the Domnitor had effected a coup, deposing his critics in Parliament), Dimitrie on November 17/5, 1865. As noted by scholar Mihaela Mudure, \"Elena never complained about her husband's filandering, nor about her inability to birth a child, who would have consolidated her marital relationship with Alexandru Ioan Cuza. [...] She records the appearance of two children, born to her husband's mistress, as a normal ocurrence. In the adoption papers, they are mentioned as 'bereft of parents'\". Both boys were baptized Romanian Orthodox, having as their godfathers the Domnitors associates, Librecht and Iordache Lambrino.  Their acceptance into the family came just as Cuza's authoritarian reign descended into administrative chaos, and as the monarch himself was calming his nervous states with alcohol and womanizing. The adoption act was especially alarming for the growing camp of anti-Cuzists, many of whom were dedicated supporters of rule by a foreign prince. As noted by scholar Frederick Kellogg: \"On some Romanian palates, Cuza's amorous affair smacked of a scheme to establish a native dynasty with bastards as heirs to the crown.\" Among those who suggest that Cuza intended to make Sa\u0219a his successor is researcher Alexandru Lapedatu, who also concluded that, at the time, Cuza was overreaching, isolated, \"surrounded and adored by his favorites\". According to historian Barbara Jelavich, while some in Cuza's party did look to Maria Obrenovi\u0107's sons as the natural successors to the throne, \"there was so much opposition to the idea of a native prince, as well as to Cuza himself, that this alternative had little chance of success.\" She continues: \"By 1865 Cuza had won a formidable array of opponents on both the right and left.\"  Gender historian Nicoleta Roman uses the Cuza family as a study case of illegitimacy and adultery in the two principalities. She notes that the adoption was probably accepted by Elena after her husband's pressures. This is also reported by military historian Constantin Chiper, according to whom Elena Cuza was at first \"revolted\" by the monarch's requests, and remained \"profoundly depressed\" by his affair. The truth concerning Sa\u0219a's birth was a matter of public record, and a subject of great irritation for Elena's clan, the Rosettis. According to Roman: \"Contemporaries knew about [the liaison] and did not refrain from condemning the great prince's immoral behavior, nor from turning the subject into a scandal where the mother was the main culprit.\" Nevertheless, both Alexandru and Dimitrie were still being introduced as orphans. In one such version of events, they were presented as Bucharest children, rescued from the 1864 flood. Cuza remained adamant that the boys had \"no known parents\"\u2014this definition is preserved in his testament of January 1873, whereby Elena and the two male heirs are each granted a third of the Cuza family estate. The document nominated Metropolitan-Primate Calinic Miclescu and Efrem Ghermani as, respectively, caretaker of the estate and tutor of the Cuza boys.  With Elena's acquiescence, Maria had been by Alexandru Ioan's side during much of his career, and was found with him when, in February 1866, a \"monstrous coalition\" conspiracy deposed and exiled Cuza. During Cuza's arrest, the conspirators separated Cuza and Maria from Elena, who was left with the two boys. Seen as especially dangerous, Librecht was imprisoned by the 1st Chasseurs Battalion. He was subject to several quick trials over charges of embezzlement, and, though eventually aquitted, was asked to leave the country. In parallel, the deposed monarch was also pressured into exile. Elena decided to join him, even as the Rosettis (some of whom had participated in the coup), asked her to sue for a divorce. The Cuzas moved periodically, from Austria-Hungary to the Kingdom of Italy, then to the German Empire, at Heidelberg. Although Cuza was no longer welcome in Romania, his wife and the two boys made occasional returns to their domain at Ruginoasa. Maria Obrenovi\u0107 followed the Cuzas into exile, accompanied by her nephew Efrem Ghermani. In Vienna, she gave birth to another son, Radu. Purportedly fathered by a Russian officer (Konstantinovich), he was given the family name Catargi, and grew up to become a Romanian Land Forces general.  Claimant Later in 1866, Romanian representatives had selected Carol I as the Domnitor, and had agreed to a dynastic rule under his House of Hohenzollern. Alexandru Ioan died in May 1873 at Heidelberg, leaving his last will to be contested by a collateral Cuza line. Elena, Alexandru and Dimitrie moved to France, sharing their house with the Domnitors former secretary, Frenchman Arthur Baligot de Beyne. In August of that year, French Prime Minister Albert de Broglie reported to his ambassadors that Carol was meeting the opposition of \"extreme parties\", and that \"hostile newspapers have no shame in publicly advancing as a candidate one of Cuza's sons, for whom a Regency seems to have been already created.\" In 1875, a Bondrea Cuza and a Mrs. Figa opened a legal case against the adoption at the Suceava County court, and implied that they were going to expose Sa\u0219a and Dimitrie's true parentage; in the end, the plaintiffs failed to attend the procedures, and the case was annulled. Maria Obrenovi\u0107 spent her final years as a lady-in-waiting for Empress Augusta. In 1876, having been diagnosed with cancer, she committed suicide aged 41. Her belongings were left to Milan, Maria's legitimate son, who renounced all claims to them in 1879. During those years, her Obrenovi\u0107 son (married to the Romanian Natalia Ke\u0219co) had taken power in the Principality of Serbia, replacing his assassinated uncle Mihailo III; Milan himself ultimately abdicated in 1889.  During that interval, Carol successfully led a War of Independence against the Ottoman Empire. Its diplomatic conclusion was helped along by Sa\u0219a's uncle, George Catargi, who persuaded Carol not to occupy the Vidin Eyalet, which was also claimed by Obrenovi\u0107 Serbia. Meanwhile, Elena Cuza continued to care for her husband's progeny, creating a family home for them at Ruginoasa, where they were often joined by her relatives, the Lambrino family. In the mid-1870s, the Cuza children again left Ruginoasa to pursue their studies abroad. Alexandru Al. Ioan himself graduated from the University of Paris Faculty of Law, and took some additional lectures in History. The Ruginoasa manor was again left unattended until 1879, when, as the new co-owner of the place, Alexandru took over the administrative chores. An inveterate card player, he gambled away much of its revenue.  Alexandru Al. Ioan Cuza, obeying his adoptive mother's wish, also entered politics. A macaronic diary note by culture critic Titu Maiorescu reads: Der \u00e4ltere Cuza-Sohn hat g\u0103rg\u0103uni im Kopf seit er hier sein Freiwilligenjahr und viel mit M\u0103ria-Ta angeredet (\"The older Cuza son has had a bee in his bonnet ever since he took here [in Romania] his one-year military service as a volunteer, and they often referred to him as Your Highness\"). His younger brother, who suffered a debilitating disease of the lungs, was living in Paris, and showed no interest in politics. Alexandru's bid was in generating opposition against Carol (who was crowned King of Romania in 1881). As \"Prince Cuza\", Sa\u0219a participated in the election of January 1888, winning a seat in the Assembly, for Mehedin\u021bi County, Third College. He placed first after ballotage, having rallied with the opposition Conservatives. He soon after relinquished his seat. This decision is attributed by Chiper to political adversity: \"the name he carried was a danger for his father's enemies who [...] launched on a furious campaign against his person\".   In a letter he sent from Cannes on February 13, Cuza noted that he would have wanted to represent the peasantry and champion their cause, but that the Assembly Presidency was likely to be taken by one who had betrayed his father. On March 4, his election was ruled legitimate by the Assembly, though his resignation was also recorded. Deputy Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu, who had been Alexandru Ioan's long-time political associate, welcomed Sa\u0219a's resignation as a wise gesture, which \"has spared this Chamber much embarrassment.\" He also noted that it was natural for the peasant electorate to appreciate both Cuzas, since the Domnitor had \"made them into landowners.\" A later assessment in O S\u00e9culo daily noted that the young Cuza was in fact below the legal age for holding political office, and that his letters, including one he sent to Kog\u0103lniceanu, simply illustrated his \"wish to abstain.\"  In August 1888, Cuza financed Adev\u0103rul, an anti-Hohenzollern sheet that had first seen print in 1871. Published by Alexandru Beldiman and Grigore Ventura, it stated as its main goal the removal of the \"foreign dynasty\", demanding an elective monarchy and the universal male suffrage. It was reviewed with skepticism by those farther on the left, which identified Cuza as more directly involved in printing Adev\u0103rul. A notice in Le Parti Ouvrier, the French socialist paper, read: \"The director of this rag is Alexandre Couza, son of the prince Couza, who was dethroned in 1866.\" It called Adev\u0103rul a \"reactionary, Russophile\" gazette. In October, writer Jacques Saint-C\u00e8re depicted Sa\u0219a as the \"accredited representative\" of a \"Russophile party\", and a \"docile organ of Russian influence.\" Reputedly, Alexandru now considered himself a likely candidate to the position of elective monarch.  Withdrawal and death  Later in 1888, a widespread anti-Carlist riot shook the Romanian countryside, and myths about Sa\u0219a's direct involvement began to spread. The rioters of D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba were persuaded that \"sums of cash provided for by Cuza's boy\" had been stolen by government officials. One peasant rebel, who escaped into the Principality of Bulgaria, spoke about a shady connection between the Cuzas, as proponents of deeper land reform, and Russian interests in Romania. He claimed that: \"Cuza's son has visited the Tsar of Russia and the latter ordered him to write to all villages so that they should kill their boyars and demand their rights [...]. Russia's emperor [...] gave money to Cuza's son, who went and bought two storage rooms full of wheat in C\u0103l\u0103ra\u0219i, that the inhabitants were supposed to divide among them, but the boyars hid [that wheat].\" As noted by O S\u00e9culo, a \"small group of those whom they call 'Cuzists'\" was helping Alexandru to advance his vague claim to the throne; however, any proof as to whether he was actually involved in the incidents, if it existed, was made a state secret by the intervention of government officials. Beldiman, who was still Cuza's political associate, saw the rebellion as entirely instigated by the Russians.  Some time later, Sa\u0219a Cuza withdrew from public life, and settled in Ruginoasa. He had by become the only recognized male heir: also at Ruginoasa, Dimitrie had shot himself after an unhappy love affair. As the one surviving son, Alexandru enjoyed ownership over most of Ruginoasa and the traditional Cuza demesne of Barbo\u0219i, essentially stripping Elena Cuza of her share in the Cuza estate. Shortly after Alexandru married fellow aristocrat Maria Moruzi (born 1863). The beautiful daughter of Alecu Moruzi and Adela (a Sturdza noblewoman), she was described by her contemporaries as a prototype of 19th-century Moldavian aristocracy. She drew his attention while they were both attending a party at Colonel Gheorghe Rosnovanu's place.   Alexandru bequeathed to Maria his entire share in the Cuza estate. The decision was controversial, not least of all because Maria's ancestor, an 18th-century Moldavian Prince by the name of Constantine Mourousis, had put to death Sa\u0219a's own forebear, Ioni\u021b\u0103 Cuza. Some accounts suggest that Elena herself opposed the arrangement; she confided to her distant relative, A. C. Cuza, that she had \"nothing against that marriage\", though she was also \"stunned\" to find out that she had been disinherited. Already diagnosed with heart trouble, Alexandru fell ill with tuberculosis. According to some, his disease was a quickly progressing form, contracted during his wedding voyage. Others however note that both Alexandru and Dimitrie had suffered from \"chest illness\" for many years, and had taken little care of themselves. Journalist Lumin\u021ba Duca-Sanda reads this as a reference to \"the heart disease that had also struck down his father\". A. C. Cuza provides additional detail, noting that the young pretender had a \"chronic heart disease\" and was sexually impotent.   The main Cuza line was abruptly ended when Alexandru Al. Ioan died, on the morning of April 4, 1890 [O. S. March 23]. Various sources note that this was six months into his marriage, occurring while the couple was visiting the Kingdom of Spain\u2014more precisely, in Madrid. Madrid's correspondent for Le XIXe Si\u00e8cle newspaper reported that, by March 30, the Prince was \"in mortal danger\", and that Elena Cuza was traveling there to see him a final time. She received the news of his death while still en route; the task of recovering his body fell on his brother-in-law, Sebastian Moruzi. His remains were transported back to Ruginoasa, and buried alongside the tombs of his father and brother. In the immediate aftermath, Elena asked to be handed her adoptive son's private papers, but Maria and Sebastian Moruzi refused to relinquish them: \"[Maria] could not hand over Alexandru's documents without creating suspicion that she was only out to get his fortune.\"  Posterity As noted in 1938 by publicist Theodor R\u0103\u0219canu (a distant relative of the figures involved), Sa\u0219a Cuza made little or no effort to provide for Elena Cuza, and never \"returned in kind her mother's love\". She was tolerated for a while on Ruginoasa premises, before Maria Moruzi-Cuza pressured her into leaving, and then took her to court over the validity of Alexandru's last will. The former consort of the Domnitor died in 1909, having spent her final years in Piatra Neam\u021b town. Although the Cuzas' agnatic line was entirely extinguished with all collateral relatives dying childless, it was still invoked as a means to earn popularity within the anti-Carlist movement. In the 1890s, agitator Alexandru Bogdan-Pite\u0219ti was passing himself off as Cuza's son, in what was probably a bid to earn the peasants' attention. During the rural insurgency of March 1907, some samples of black propaganda presented Crown Prince Ferdinand and \"Cuza's son\" as rebel sympathizers. In elections in November 1919 (the first ones to be held in Greater Romania and under universal male suffrage), A. C. Cuza ran as a Democratic Nationalist in Dorohoi County, and soundly defeated the Progressive Conservatives. As a partisan of the latter, Constantin A. Stoeanovici complained that: \"[the Nationalists] presented themselves in elections by promising free land to the peasants, tax exemptions, and that their [...] candidates are descendants of Domnitor Cuza, who had given land to the peasants.\"  Another public scandal involving Maria Moruzi took place ca. 1897, when it became known that she was pursuing an affair with the young engineer Ion I. C. Br\u0103tianu (later a major political figure). This controversy had its own political connotations: Br\u0103tianu's father, Ion Br\u0103tianu, was a National Liberal representative in the 1866 conspiracy to topple Cuza. Rumors leaked to the press and the affair, together with the running Cuza\u2013Moruzi lawsuit, created a sensation: Adev\u0103rul itself began referring to the estate as Ru\u0219inoasa (\"Place of Shame\"). The affair resulted in an unwanted pregnancy, and Maria was compelled to marry Br\u0103tianu. Their marriage broke local taboos: it lasted just one day, ending in as hasty a divorce. The couple's son was Gheorghe I. Br\u0103tianu, later a historian and politician, who lived at Ruginoasa until 1938. His mother shared ownership of the manor, and, in 1912, sold the corresponding property in Barbo\u0219i to socialite Elena Volenti.   Maria Moruzi died in 1921, having by then served as president of the Romanian Red Cross. The Ruginoasa buildings, part of which had been donated to Elena Cuza's Caritatea Hospital, were heavily damaged during the World War II air raids on Romania. In 1945, financial pressures led Gheorghe Br\u0103tianu to sell the Ruginoasa domain, which eventually became an administrative complex of the Romanian Railways Company (CFR). Under communist rule, the state nationalized and retained it as cultural patrimony. During 2003, CFR unsuccessfully sued the Romanian state for damages. The claim to Cuza's inheritance had meanwhile been revived by other supposed male descendants. With a 1944 affidavit preserved in its 1994 photocopy, Frenchman Fabius Laiter claimed that he was the only surviving son of three children born to Dimitrie Cuza and Iliana Cojocariu. In the 1990s, a Chilean man, Abraham Orlando Decebal Cuza Hern\u00e1ndez, publicized his claim to descent from the Domnitor, but failed to clarify which of the brothers was his ancestor. As of 2011, the last verified Cuza descendant was Dimitrie Callimachi, who inherits the claim from his ancestor Maria Cuza, sister of the Domnitor, but states that \"the monarchy is an antiquated institution in Romania.\"  Notes  References Constantin Chiper, \"Elena Cuza \u00een memoria rom\u00e2nilor (2)\", in For\u021bele Terestre.

Oliva (born January 6, 1973) is an American Republican politician from Florida. He served in the  Florida House of Representatives, representing the Hialeah and Miami Lakes area in northern Miami-Dade County from 2011 to 2020. He was speaker of the House during his last term in office from 2018 to 2020.  History Oliva was born in Elizabeth, New Jersey, and moved to the state of Florida in 1974. He graduated from Hialeah-Miami Lakes High School, and later attended St. Thomas University, but did not graduate. Oliva founded a cigar manufacturing business with his brothers, and eventually served as its chief executive officer. From 2001 to 2005, he served as a Hialeah housing commissioner.  Florida House of Representatives When incumbent state representative Esteban Bovo resigned from the legislature to successfully run for the Miami-Dade County Commission in 2011, a special election was called to replace him. Oliva ran in the Republican primary against Frank Lago and Rafael Luiz Perez, emphasizing his support for \"lower taxes, small and accountable government, [and] conservative family values.\" He ended up winning the primary, receiving 42% of the vote to Lago's 35% and Perez's 23%, and advanced to the general election, where he only faced write-in opposition. Oliva won the general election handily, winning 93% of the vote.  In 2012, following the reconfiguration of the legislative districts, Oliva remained in the 110th District, which retained most of the territory that he had previously represented. He was challenged in the Republican primary by Ileana Abay, but he dispatched her easily, winning renomination with 86% of the vote. In the general election, he once again only faced write-in opposition, and he won his second term with nearly 100% of the vote.  Following his re-election, Oliva received enough votes from his colleagues in the legislature to assume the position of Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives for the 2018\u201320 legislative session.  Oliva was term-limited from the House in 2020, after serving a partial term and four full terms.  In February 2019, Oliva referred to pregnant women as a \"host body\" a total of five times during an interview with CBS4's Jim DeFede in Miami. In response, state representative Anna Eskamani stated, \"With all due respect Mr. Speaker, my body is not a \"host\" and personal medical decisions around my pregnancy belong to me, my family, my doctor, and my faith\u2014 not to politicians.\" Oliva apologized for the term, stating, \"It was an attempt to use terminology found in medical ethics writings with the purpose of keeping the discussion dispassionate. The reaction undoubtedly shows it had the exact opposite effect. I apologize for having caused offense, my aim was the contrary.\"  References  External links Florida House of Representatives - Jose R.

Other programs  Art Museum  The NIU Art Museum originated in the NIU School of Art during the 1960s as an exhibition center curated by the faculty. In 1970, Gallery 200 was established as a permanent exhibition space within the newly constructed art building. In 1979, the Art Gallery moved to larger quarters in Swen Parson Hall and began to acquire a permanent collection. In 1990, the Swen Parson Art Gallery became a separate academic unit within the College of Visual and Performing Arts and its name was changed from \"gallery\" to \"museum\" to reflect its growing permanent collection. In 1991, the NIU Art Museum moved into the 5000 square-foot former auditorium in historic Altgeld Hall. This space was closed in December 1998 as Altgeld Hall was prepared to undergo a major renovation project. The Art Museum reopened in 2004 in the remodeled Altgeld Galleries.  During the renovation, the NIU Art Museum offices moved to a temporary site off campus where the Museum staff oversaw its Museum without Walls program. While its main gallery was closed, the Art Museum collaborated with artists and local community \u2018Partners in Art\u2019 in the development, design and production of contemporary art installations, events and projects at various locations within the greater DeKalb area.  The NIU Chicago Gallery was founded in 1985 as an outreach unit located in Chicago\u2019s River North gallery district. In this space, the Museum presented contemporary conceptual and installation art as well as the work of NIU faculty and students. In June 2006, facing tightening state funds, the Museum and University administration closed the NIU Chicago Gallery and reallocated resources supporting that space to the College.  The Jack Olson Memorial Gallery (formerly Gallery 200) generally shows two professional art exhibitions per year and six student group art exhibitions. The Gallery was renamed in 1996 to honor art professor and past gallery director Charles \u201cJack\u201d Olson who taught at NIU from 1969 until 1994. The Olson Gallery was administered by NIU Art Museum staff from 1995 - 2004. Now, the Olson Gallery is run exclusively by the School of Art at NIU.  Community School of Arts  The NIU Community School of the Arts is an outreach program of the NIU of Visual and Performing Arts.  Huskie Marching Band The NIU Huskie Marching Band performs at all university home football games, at select away games, and at post-season bowl games. The band entertains the stadium crowd while both on the field an in the stands. The Huskie Marching Band also entertains crowds at select parades and university events and contributes to the education of members who may become band directors.  History In 1899, fourteen men gathered under the direction of Mr. Calvin Dart with horns and drums in hand to form what eventually became the NIU Huskie Marching Band.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Suicide of Tyler Clementi\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Tyler Clementi (December 19, 1991 \u2013 September 22, 2010) was an American student at Rutgers University\u2013New Brunswick who jumped to his death from the George Washington Bridge over the Hudson River at the age of 18, on September 22, 2010. On September 19, 2010, Clementi's roommate, Dharun Ravi, used a webcam on his dorm room computer and his hallmate Molly Wei's computer to view, without Clementi's knowledge, Clementi kissing another man. Clementi eventually found out, after Ravi posted about the webcam incident on Twitter. Two days later, Ravi urged friends and Twitter followers to watch via his webcam a second tryst between Clementi and his friend, though the viewing never occurred.  Ravi and Wei were federally indicted for their roles in the webcam incidents, though they were not charged with a role in the suicide itself. On May 6, 2011, Wei entered a plea agreement allowing her to avoid prosecution. Ravi went to trial in early 2012, and was convicted on May 21, 2012, on multiple charges related to the webcam viewing. After an appeals court overturned parts of the conviction, Ravi pleaded guilty to one count of attempted invasion of privacy on October 27, 2016.  Clementi's death brought national attention to the issue of cyberbullying and the struggles facing LGBT youth.  Background Clementi was born on December 19, 1991, in Ridgewood, New Jersey. A graduate of Ridgewood High School, he was a violinist; he played with the Ridgewood Symphony Orchestra and participated in the Bergen Youth Orchestra as concertmaster.  A few days before leaving home to attend college at Rutgers, Clementi told his parents that he was gay. While his father supported him, Clementi said in an instant message to a friend that his mother had \"basically completely rejected\" him. In later interviews, Clementi's mother explained that she had been \"sad\" and \"quiet\" as she processed the information and that she \"felt a little betrayed\" that he had not previously confided in her that he was gay. She later noted that she had not been ready as a parent to publicly acknowledge having a gay son, partly because her evangelical church had taught that homosexuality was a sin. After their conversation, she said that she and Tyler cried, hugged, and said they loved each other. Jane Clementi said that she and Tyler spent the rest of the week together and spoke frequently on the phone when he was at Rutgers. According to his mother, Tyler seemed \"confident\" and \"comfortable\" after coming out and told her of having visited New York City with new friends.  Ravi and Wei met while students at West Windsor-Plainsboro High School North. Prior to arriving at Rutgers, Ravi tried to find information about his new roommate online. On Twitter, Ravi referred to having seen Clementi's communications on JustUsBoys, a pornographic website and message board for gay men, and tweeted \"Found out my roommate is gay\". Clementi also researched his roommate and read postings on Ravi's Twitter page. After Ravi and Clementi moved in together, they rarely interacted or spoke. Ravi's text messages to friends described Clementi as shy and awkward. Clementi's online conversations and text messages referred to his amusement at Ravi's construction of a private changing area, but Clementi said he appreciated the fact that Ravi left him alone and did not force an excessively social atmosphere.  Webcam incidents  First viewings On the nights of September 19 and 21, Clementi had asked Ravi to use their room for those evenings. On the first occasion, Ravi met Clementi's male friend, and Clementi said that the two wanted to be alone for the evening. Ravi has stated that he was worried about theft and that he left the computer in a state where he could view the webcam stream due to those concerns. Other witnesses testified that Ravi said he also wanted to confirm that Clementi was gay. Ravi and Wei viewed the video stream via iChat for a few seconds, seeing Clementi and his guest kissing. Later, Wei turned on the camera for another view with four others in the room, though Ravi was not there. During this second viewing, Wei and others saw Clementi and his guest kissing with their shirts off and their pants on.  On September 20, Clementi, who followed Ravi's Twitter account, read a message that Ravi sent a few minutes after the webcam viewing the previous day. Ravi wrote: \"Roommate asked for the room till midnight. I went into molly's room and turned on my webcam. I saw him making out with a dude. Yay.\" According to a Rutgers employee, at about 4 a.m. on September 21, Clementi sent an online request for a single room because his \"roommate used webcam to spy on me.\"  Second attempt On September 21, Ravi posted text messages saying that there would be a viewing party to watch Clementi and his guest, along with directions on how to view it remotely. At 6:39\u00a0p.m., Ravi tweeted, \"Anyone with iChat, I dare you to video chat me between the hours of 9:30 and 12. Yes, it's happening again.\" Ravi had set up the webcam and pointed it towards Clementi's bed. When Clementi returned to his room, he noticed the camera and texted a friend saying he had unplugged Ravi's powerstrip to prevent further video streaming during his date. Ravi has said that he had changed his mind regarding the broadcast and disabled the camera himself by putting the computer in sleep mode.  The same day, Clementi complained to a resident assistant and two other officials that Ravi had used a webcam to stream part of Clementi's private sexual encounter with another man. The resident assistant testified at trial that Clementi appeared shaky and uncomfortable when they met around 11\u00a0p.m., and in his official report of the meeting, the resident assistant said that Clementi requested both a room change and punishment for Ravi. In a formal e-mail request to the resident assistant made after the meeting, Clementi described the two viewing incidents, quoted from Ravi's Twitter postings, and wrote \"I feel that my privacy has been violated and I am extremely uncomfortable sharing a room with someone who would act in this wildly inappropriate manner.\" Clementi wrote in detail on the JustUsBoys and Yahoo! message boards about complaints he filed through university channels about his roommate. His posts indicated that he did not want to share a room with Ravi after he learned about the first incident and then discovered that Ravi invited his Twitter followers to watch a second sexual encounter. \"He [the resident assistant] seemed to take it seriously,\" Clementi wrote in a post about 15 hours before his jump from the George Washington Bridge.  Within a few hours, Clementi returned to his dorm room and he and Ravi were there for less than an hour.  Suicide  On the evening of September 22, Clementi left the dorm room, bought food from the campus food court, and, around 6:30\u00a0p.m., headed toward the George Washington Bridge. By 8:42\u00a0p.m. he had posted from his cell phone on Facebook: \"Jumping off the gw bridge sorry\".  Clementi left a suicide note which, along with documents on his computer, was never released to either the public or to the defense team in Ravi's trial, because Clementi's suicide was not directly related to the charges against Ravi.  Clementi's wallet, car, cell phone, and computer were found on or near the bridge. His body was found on September 29, in the Hudson River just north of the bridge. The medical examiner gave drowning as the cause of death, noting blunt impact injuries to the torso as well.  Reaction Shortly after Clementi's suicide, the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network stated, \"There has been heightened media attention surrounding the suicides in New Jersey, Texas, California, Indiana, and Minnesota.\" The same month Clementi died, four other Americans were reported to have committed suicide after being taunted about their homosexuality, although the brother of one of the deceased said he did not believe the suicide was brought on by bullying.  At Rutgers University Rutgers University students planned a \"Black Friday\" event to commemorate and memorialize Clementi. Rutgers president Richard Levis McCormick stated, \"We grieve for him and for his family, friends and classmates as they deal with the tragic loss of a gifted young man....\"  Beginning in the 2011\u20132012 school year, a Rutgers University pilot program was instituted to permit students to choose their dorm roommates, regardless of gender. Members of the university's LGBT community told the administration that gender-neutral housing would help create a more inclusive environment for students.  By September 2012, Rutgers had implemented numerous new programs to provide a more supportive environment for LGBT students, in reaction to the suicide, including new dormitory options and a new Center for Social Justice Education and LGBT Communities, and students reported a much-improved campus atmosphere.  Charitable response In 2011, Tyler Clementi's parents, Jane and Joseph Clementi, established the Tyler Clementi Foundation, which focuses on promoting acceptance of LGBT teens and others marginalized by society, providing education against all forms of bullying including cyber bullying over the internet and promoting research and development into the causes and prevention of teenage suicide.  On March 9, 2011, the Point Foundation, the nation's largest scholarship-granting organization for LGBT students of merit, announced that it had created the Tyler Clementi Point Scholarship to honor Clementi's memory. Clementi's parents said they hoped the scholarship would \"raise awareness of young people who are subject to abuse through malicious bullying.\"  In 2015, the Tyler Clementi Foundation launched #Day1, an anti-bullying campaign that aims to stop bullying before it begins, with support from Caitlyn Jenner, Sarah Jessica Parker, Matthew Broderick, Neil Patrick Harris, and others.  Government Tyler Clementi's suicide, along with the suicides of several other gay teens who had been harassed, moved President Barack Obama, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Secretary of Education Arne Duncan to express shock and sadness and speak out against any form of bullying. US Senator Frank Lautenberg and Representative Rush Holt of New Jersey introduced federal legislation titled the \"Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act\", to require schools that wish to receive federal funding to establish anti-bullying procedures and codes of conduct.  New Jersey Governor Chris Christie stated that the suicide was an \"unspeakable tragedy... I don't know how those two folks [Ravi and Wei] are going to sleep at night\" and added, \"as the father of a 17-year-old, I can't imagine what those parents are feeling today\u2014I can't.\" In response to Clementi's suicide and other, similar incidents, New Jersey General Assembly representatives Valerie Vainieri Huttle and Mary Pat Angelini introduced a bipartisan \"Anti-bullying Bill of Rights\" in November 2010, which passed on a 71\u20131 vote in the New Jersey Assembly and a 30\u20130 vote in the New Jersey Senate.  The San Diego Unified School District Board of Education unanimously approved a resolution to provide a safe environment and equal opportunities for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning students.  Parents' statements The day of the announcement of the verdict in the Dharun Ravi trial, Clementi's father, Joseph, released a statement, directed particularly at young people:  In the same statement, Jane Clementi, Tyler's mother, noted the role that electronic media can have in singling out LGBT youth for being different. She said:  Advocacy In the weeks following Clementi's suicide, schools around the area of his residence held vigils in memory of his death. Students at Hofstra University gathered for a candlelight vigil, and students and staff at Pascack Hills High School in Bergen County, near Ridgewood where Clementi lived, wore all black to mourn his death.  The incident brought wider nationwide attention to bullying of LGBT youth. \"Spirit Day\", first observed on October 20, 2010, was established in which people wear the color purple to show support for bullying victims among LGBT youth. Clementi's suicide inspired the establishment of Spirit Day, and the day received widespread support from GLAAD, Hollywood celebrities and over 1.6 million Facebook users. The Human Rights Campaign, a gay-rights advocacy organization, released a plan aimed at increasing awareness of gay-related suicide and harassment around the U.S. According to gay activist William Dobbs, around 10,000 people expressed support on social networking websites for lodging more serious criminal charges, such as manslaughter, against Ravi and Wei, a position that Dobbs himself criticized as a rush to judgment before an investigation had taken place.  However, journalist Jason St. Amand has noted that \"there are surprisingly several gay activists who are skeptical about the case and believe that Ravi is being used as a scapegoat and should receive a lesser sentence.\" William Dobbs has criticized the use of hate crime charges and what he considers to have been a hurried scapegoating of Ravi and Wei. Journalist J. Bryan Lowder has similarly criticized hate-crime laws, arguing that Ravi's motives are difficult to know, and that Ravi should not be blamed for attitudes that are \"pervasive in our culture\". Dan Savage, co-founder of the It Gets Better Project, has written that, although he considers Ravi's actions to have been \"the last straw\" that triggered Clementi's suicide, he notes that Clementi's guest did not die by suicide, and concludes that there must have been additional factors, preceding the webcam incidents, contributing to the suicide. Savage says that he deplores the \"mob mentality\" that focuses on \"a couple of stupid teenagers who should've known better but didn't.\" He argues that attention should also be directed toward the \"adults and institutions\" in society who \"perpetuate anti-gay prejudice\", and he concludes that to \"pin all the blame\" on Ravi and Wei amounts to \"a coverup\". After Ravi was sentenced, Savage said he had been \"express[ing] misgivings about the severity of the sentence that Ravi faced. But a 30 day sentence is far, far too lenient\u2014a slap on the wrist.\" Eric Marcus has compared his own father's suicide with Clementi's, and said that it will not be possible to know the real reasons for Clementi's suicide. He concluded that \"At best, we can say that Ravi's spying and subsequent Twitter messages might have triggered Clementi's suicide, which is different from causing his suicide... We've turned Tyler Clementi into a two-dimensional symbol of anti-gay bullying and Dharun Ravi into a scapegoat. This is a case that screams out for compassion and understanding.\"  The Tyler Clementi Institute for Internet Safety, a legal institute to assist other victims of cyberbullying, was launched in October 2015.  Criticism of media coverage Soon after invasion of privacy charges were brought against Ravi and Wei, gay advocacy groups and bloggers were vocal in their support for bringing hate-crime charges against the defendants. After the prosecutors issued a public statement that they were investigating whether bias played a role in the incident, according to Chris Cuomo of ABC News, a \"media floodgate of distortion\" ensued. Writing in The New Yorker, Ian Parker has stated that some of the media coverage and the public outcry against Ravi have exaggerated Ravi's role in the incident, writing that after Clementi's suicide \"it became widely understood that a closeted student at Rutgers had committed suicide after video of him having sex with a man was secretly shot and posted online. In fact, there was no posting, no observed sex, and no closet.\"  In popular culture Ellen DeGeneres described herself as \"devastated\" by Clementi's death, stating, \"Something must be done. This month alone, there has been a shocking number of news stories about teens who have been teased and bullied and then committed suicide... This needs to be a wake-up call to everyone: teenage bullying and teasing is an epidemic in this country, and the death rate is climbing.\"  The band Rise Against released a song, \"Make It Stop (September's Children)\", which mentions the names of Tyler Clementi and four other young people who died by suicide in September 2010 after being bullied based on their sexual orientation.  Madonna gave tribute to Clementi by showing a picture of him and other gay teens who have died by suicide during the Nobody Knows Me video interlude in the MDNA Tour. Canadian musician Owen Pallett released a song called \"The Secret Seven\" on his 2014 album In Conflict that addresses Clementi.  Monica Lewinsky said that Clementi's story inspired her to speak out against cyberbullying, in a TED talk called The Price of Shame.  Court case  On September 28, 2010, Dharun Ravi and Molly Wei were each charged with two counts of invasion of privacy for the September 19 webcam transmission. Ravi was charged with two additional counts for the September 21 viewing attempt. On April 20, 2011, a Middlesex County grand jury indicted Ravi on 15 counts of invasion of privacy, bias intimidation, tampering with evidence, witness tampering, and hindering apprehension or prosecution.  On May 6, 2011, Wei entered a plea agreement allowing her to avoid prosecution in exchange for her testimony against Ravi, 300 hours of community service, counseling, and classes on dealing with people of alternative lifestyles.  On March 16, 2012, Ravi was convicted on all 15 counts for his role in the webcam spying incidents. On May 21, 2012, Ravi was sentenced to 30 days in jail, 3 years' probation, 300 hours of community service, a $10,000 fine, and counseling on cyberbullying and alternative lifestyles. Both the prosecutors and Ravi filed separate appeals. On June 18, 2012, Ravi was released from jail after 20 days of his sentence. Federal immigration authorities said that Ravi would not be deported to India.  In February 2016, Ravi asked the courts to overturn his convictions following a 2015 New Jersey Supreme Court ruling that struck down as unconstitutionally vague a part of the law under which he was charged. In September 2016, the convictions were overturned by an appeals court in New Jersey, in a decision supported by prosecutors because of the earlier ruling on constitutionality. A request to maintain the convictions for other crimes, such as invasion of privacy and witness tampering, was denied because of the influence bias allegations. Ravi accepted a plea deal on October 27, 2016, and pleaded guilty to one count of attempted invasion of privacy, a third-degree felony. He was sentenced to time already served and fines paid, and the remaining charges against him were dropped.

In 2012, his roommate, Dharun Ravi, was convicted of spying on Clementi, the first criminal case in the United States involving a victim who died by suicide. On the evening of September 20, 2010, Tyler Clementi, a freshman at Rutgers University, bid farewell to his friends and took his life by jumping off the George Washington Bridge into the Hudson River. His body was found on September 22, 2010, after a search that involved the use of a police helicopter and thermal imaging technology. A friend of Clementi's, David Scharbaum, said that Clementi had been depressed about being rejected from the college's rugby team. However, Scharbaum said that Clementi had seemed to be doing better after getting a date for the upcoming Rutgers fall dance. Scharbaum also said that he had seen a notice on Clementi's Facebook page about the dance. \"I saw that he was excited about it,\" Scharbaum said. Clementi's roomate, Dharun Ravi, told investigators that he had spied on Clementi through a webcam and had seen him in a compromising position with another man. After discovering the affair, Ravi had reported it to friends, and his actions were described as \"homophobic\" and \"disrespectful\" by one of the friends. In the weeks prior to his death, Clementi had asked Ravi to report the affair to the Rutgers authorities, but Ravi had not done so. In 2012, a New Jersey state court convicted Ravi of \"assment, Dumbness, and Inhumanity to a person\" for spying on Clementi. He was also convicted of a count of \"disorderly conduct\" for his conduct during the initial investigation by Rutgers police. Ravi was sentenced to three years in prison. In September 2012, the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) named Clementi as one of their \"10 Most speech-restricted colleges in the country\". FIRE also named Rutgers University as the \" Speech Code of the Month\" for September 2012, citing the school's suspension of 10 students, including Clementi, for offensive Facebook posts as one of the reasons. In 2013, Rutgers University officials released a report on the school's handling of the affair. The report found that the Rutgers police had issued a \"preliminary finding of responsibility\" to Clementi for his death, but that this finding was not supported by the evidence. The report also found that there were \" Gross Mishaps and Misjudgments \" in the university's handling of the case, and that the school's \" systems and processes \" had failed.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 29016074}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Midget car racing\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Midget cars, also speedcars in Australia, is a class of racing cars. The cars are very small with a very high power-to-weight ratio and typically use four cylinder engines. They originated in the United States in the 1930s and are raced on most continents. There is a worldwide tour and national midget tours in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand.  Cars  Typically, these four cylinder engine cars have  to  and weigh . The high power and small size of the cars combine to make midget racing quite dangerous; for this reason, modern midget cars are fully equipped with roll cages and other safety features. Some early major midget car manufacturers include Kurtis Kraft (1930s to 1950s) and Solar (1944\u201346). Midgets are intended to be driven for races of relatively short distances, usually 2.5 to 25 miles (4 to 40\u00a0km). Some events are staged inside arenas, like the Chili Bowl held in early January at the Tulsa Expo Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma. There are midget races in dirt track racing and in asphalt (paved tracks).  There are three-quarter (TQ) midgets which developed from \"midget midget\" cars of the late 1940s. Quarter midgets are the one quarter the size of a full midget car.  History   The first organized Midget car race happened on June 4, 1933. The sports' first regular weekly program began on August 10, 1933 at the Loyola High School Stadium in Los Angeles under the control of the first official governing body, the Midget Auto Racing Association (MARA). After spreading across the country, the sport traveled around the world; first to Australia in 1934 at Melbourne's Olympic Park on December 15, and to New Zealand in 1937. Early midget races were held on board tracks previously used for bicycle racing. When the purpose built speedway at Gilmore Stadium was completed, racing ended at the school stadium, and hundreds of tracks began to spring up across the United States. Angell Park Speedway in Sun Prairie, Wisconsin (near Madison) is another major track in the United States operating since the first half of the twentieth century.  The AAA Contest Board soon started sanctioning midget races across the country, facing opposition from independent drivers and racetracks. After the AAA withdrew from sanctioning races in 1955, the United States Auto Club took over as the major sanctioning body of midget car racing in the United States. NASCAR had a midget division from 1952 to 1968.  Soon after in Australia, speedcar racing became popular with the first Australian Speedcar Championship being contested in Melbourne in 1935, its popularity running through the country's \"golden era\" of the 1950s and 1960s. Australian promoters such as Adelaide's Kym Bonython who ran the Rowley Park Speedway, and Empire Speedways who ran the Brisbane Exhibition Ground and the famous Sydney Showground Speedway, often imported drivers from the US, such as the popular Jimmy Davies. Promoters in Australia during this period often staged races billed as either a \"world speedcar championship\" or \"world speedcar derby\". During this time speedcars were arguably the most popular category in Australian speedway with crowds of up to 30,000 attending meetings at the Sydney Showground and over 10,000 in Adelaide and Brisbane.  Speedcars continue to race in Australia, with the major events being the Australian Championship, and the Australian Speedcar Grand Prix (first run in 1938). Along with various state championships, there is also the Speedcar Super Series which travels throughout Australia. Speedcar crowds of 10,000 people are common in Australia for these major events.  In December 2013, POWRi Midget Racing began a 16-event Lucas Oil POWRi Midget World Championship that ran until June 2014. Drivers competed in New Zealand and Australia at the beginning of the 2013\u201314 season and ended in the United States.  Midget car racing also grew in popularity in the Northeast of the United States, in part due to racers like Bill Schindler and events at tracks like that at Hinchcliffe Stadium.  Stepping stone to high profile divisions  Many IndyCar and NASCAR drivers used midget car racing as an intermediate stepping stone on their way to more high-profile divisions, including Tony Stewart, Sarah Fisher, Jeff Gordon, A. J. Foyt, Mario Andretti, Kasey Kahne, Ryan Newman, Kyle Larson , Art Pollard  and others. The events are sometimes held on weeknights so that popular and famous drivers from other, higher-profiled types of motor racing (who race in those higher-profiled types of racing on the weekends) will be available to compete, and so that it does not conflict with drivers' home tracks.  Notable midget car races  In 1959 Lime Rock Park held a famous Formula Libre race, where Rodger Ward shocked the expensive and exotic sports cars by beating them on the road course in an Offenhauser powered midget car, usually used on oval tracks. Ward used an advantageous power-to-weight ratio and dirt-track cornering abilities to steal the win.

It carries the High Speed 1 (HS1) railway line, and is located on the boundary between the Medway and Swale areas of Kent. The bridge was built by the Channel Tunnel Rail Link (CTRL) project to carry the new HS1 line from London to the Kent coast. The bridge has two spans, the northern one being 7,345 metres (24,009 ft) long and the southern one being 3,800 metres (12,500 ft) long. The bridge is one of the longest in Europe, and the longest in the UK. The bridge was officially opened on 28 September 2007. The bridge is built to the west of the existing Network Rail bridge, which was constructed in the early 1970s as part of the first Channel Tunnel Rail Link project. The old bridge was originally built to take Eurostar trains to the Channel Tunnel, but these services now use the HS1 line and the new bridge. The bridge has two dedicated tracks for high speed trains, and two tracks for commuter services to and from London. The bridge has been designed to be environmentally friendly, with a minimum impact on the local wildlife. The bridge has been built with a special coating to prevent birds from crashing into it, and the supporting pillars have been designed to provide a safe place for bats to roost. The bridge has been built with two different types of foundations. The northern span is built on a series of piled foundations, while the southern span is built on a series of concrete pillars. The bridge has also been built with a special coating to protect it from the weather. The bridge has been designed with two separate tracks for high speed trains and two tracks for commuter services.

It appeared in 1996, and differs from R-trees (1984), R+-trees (1987) and R*-trees (1990) because it emphasizes prevention of overlap in the bounding boxes, which increasingly becomes a problem in high dimensions. In cases where nodes cannot be split without preventing overlap, the node split will be deferred, resulting in super-nodes.  In extreme cases, the tree will linearize, which defends against worst-case behaviors observed in some other data structures.  Structure The X-tree consists of three different types of nodes\u2014data nodes, normal directory nodes and supernodes. The data nodes of the X-tree contain rectilinear minimum bounding rectangles (MBRs) together with pointers to the actual data objects, and the directory nodes contain MBRs together with pointers to sub-MBRs. Supernodes are large directory nodes of variable size(a multiple of the usual block size). The basic goal of supernodes is to avoid splits in the directory that would result in an inefficient directory structure.  References  R-tree Database index techniques", "machine_text": " In computer science, X-tree is a data structure used for efficient mapping of ranges to values. It is named after its shape, which resembles an X when drawn as a binary tree. An X-tree is an index structure that maps keys (which are ranges) to values in a dynamic set. It is a generalization of a binary search tree to multiple dimensions, so that it can be used to map multi-dimensional ranges to values. X-trees are often compared with trie data structures, which are maps of strings to values. The primary difference is that X-trees are used for mapping ranges to values, while trie data structures are used for mapping strings to values. An X-tree is a balanced tree, which means that all leaf nodes are at the same level. The root node of an X-tree is a single leaf node. The left and right subtrees of a node are never empty. The topmost level of an X-tree is called the \"root level\". The next level of an X-tree is called the \"first level\". The level that is two levels below the root level is called the \"second level\". And so on. An X-tree is a dynamic set, which means that it can be modified by inserting new values, deleting existing values, and changing the value associated with a key. insert operations are O(log n) where n is the number of nodes in the X-tree. delete operations are also O(log n). changing the value associated with a key is O(log n). The number of nodes in an X-tree is O(n log n), where n is the number of ranges mapped to values. The number of leaves in an X-tree is O(n). The height of an X-tree is O(log n). The keys in an X-tree are ranges, which means that two keys can overlap. An X-tree is said to be consistent if the values associated with overlapping keys are equal. An X-tree is said to be complete if every key in the domain is mapped to a value in the set. The simplest X-tree is an X-ray, which is an X-tree with a single level. An X-ray is equivalent to a binary search tree, and so it maps ranges to values in O(log n) time, where n is the number of nodes in the X-ray. An X-tree can be used to implement a dynamic range minimum query. This is similar to the dynamic segment tree, which is a range minimum query on a dynamic set. X-trees can also be used for efficient dynamic counting of the number of distinct values in a large set.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2330838}

Hunted is a crime drama in the form of a chase film, starring Dirk Bogarde, and written by Jack Whittingham and Michael McCarthy. It was produced by Julian Wintle and edited by Gordon Hales and Geoffrey Muller, with cinematography by Eric Cross and music by Hubert Clifford.    The film won the Golden Leopard award at the 1952 Locarno International Film Festival.  Plot Robbie (Jon Whiteley), an orphaned 6-year-old boy, has been placed with uncaring and harsh adoptive parents in London.  Having accidentally set a small fire in the house, he fears he will receive severe punishment as he has in the past for misdemeanours, so flees into the London streets. Here, he literally runs into Chris Lloyd (Dirk Bogarde) who is himself on the run as he has, in the heat of passion, just killed  his wife's employer, whom Lloyd had discovered, was having an affair with his wife.  Robbie attaches himself to Lloyd, who repeatedly tries to rid himself of the boy, albeit as caringly as possible. Lloyd decides, hesitantly, to use the boy to retrieve some much needed cash from his apartment. Thereafter, Lloyd feels compelled to bring Robbie along with him. The film follows the pair as they travel northwards towards Scotland, with the police in somewhat baffled pursuit, and charts the developing relationship between the two. Initially Lloyd regards Robbie dismissively, as an unwanted inconvenience, while Robbie is wary and suspicious of Lloyd.  As their journey progresses, however, the pair gradually develop a strong bond of friendship, trust and common cause. Both feel they have 'burned their bridges' and now have nothing to lose.  They finally reach a small Scottish fishing port, where Lloyd steals a boat and sets sail for Ireland. During the voyage Robbie falls seriously ill, and Lloyd turns the boat back towards Scotland, where he knows the police are waiting for him.

He was called in for a screen test and was cast.  Much of the film was shot on location, with three main areas being used.   The early London exterior scenes were shot in the Pimlico/Victoria area, which at the time still had derelict corners showing evidence of wartime damage. The location chosen for the scenes set in the English Midlands was the area in and around Stoke-on-Trent, with its distinctive industrial skyline of factory chimneys and giant pottery kilns.  The railway sequence in this section was shot on the now-defunct Potteries Loop Line, and this scene has come to be regarded as historically significant by British railway enthusiasts as it provides a very rare filmic depiction of the long-gone line in operation.  Scottish filming took place in the vicinity of Portpatrick in Wigtownshire and featured the fishing boat 'Mizpah' BA-11 built by Noble of Girvan (1949).

He was one of the key witnesses in the trial against the killers of Antimafia judge Giovanni Falcone.  La Barbera was born in Altofonte, in the province of Palermo. In 1981, he was initiated in the Altofonte cosca and, in 1986, he became the regent of the Altofonte Mafia family after the arrest of Bernardo Brusca.  After the arrest of Mafia boss Tot\u00f2 Riina in January 1993, the remaining bosses, among them La Barbera, Giuseppe Graviano, Matteo Messina Denaro, Giovanni Brusca, Leoluca Bagarella, and Antonino Gio\u00e8, came together a few times (often in the Santa Flavia area in Bagheria, on an estate owned by the mafioso Leonardo Greco). They decided on a strategy to force the Italian state to retreat. That resulted in a series of bomb attacks in 1993 in the Via dei Georgofili in Florence, in Via Palestro in Milan and in the Piazza San Giovanni in Laterano, and Via San Teodoro in Rome, which left 10 people dead and 93 injured as well as damage to centres of cultural heritage such as the Uffizi Gallery.  On March 23, 1993, La Barbera, Antonino Gio\u00e8 and Salvatore Bentivegna were arrested in Milan. The police taped them while they were planning bomb attacks. La Barbera started to collaborate with the authorities in November 1993.   La Barbera confessed his participation in the slaying of Antimafia judge Giovanni Falcone. He followed Falcone's car as it sped toward Palermo, keeping in constant touch with Leoluca Bagarella, Antonino Gio\u00e8 and Giovanni Brusca on the hillside near Capaci. Brusca set off the explosion.   He also admitted to have been involved in the killing of Salvo Lima, the former mayor of Palermo.  His father Girolamo La Barbera (born in 1925) was murdered on June 10, 1994, because he defended the choice of his son to become a pentito. The killing was staged as a suicide. Among the killers were Michele Traina and Domenico Raccuglia. The order came from Giovanni Brusca. Traina and Raccuglia received life sentences for the killing in June 2005, while Brusca was sentenced to 13 years.  In October 1997, the pentito La Barbera was rearrested. Although a key witness in several important trials under way, he had returned home and recommenced his criminal activities and avenge atrocities carried out on family members.

He was appointed as reader in Aligarh Muslim University, later becoming professor of Urdu Language and then honorary consultant of the department.   Khan journeyed to acquaint himself with the centres of Islamic importance in India, where he met Sheikh ul-Hadith Muhammad Zakariya al-Kandahlawi (1898\u20131982) and the reformer Maulana Muhammad Yusuf Kandhalawi, from whom he learned dawah and reformation.  Soon after, he attended Lucknow University and earned a PhD.  Work  Khan is a prolific writer in Urdu.  Perhaps his best-known work is A history in Urdu Journalism (1822\u20131857) (1991), which examines newspapers from nine different cities.  His works are part of the syllabi in various universities, and several have been translated into English.  His wide-ranging study of Urdu journalistic literature is a contribution of abiding value to the appreciation of India ethos at a crucial moment in Indian history.  His extensive study of contemporary Urdu literature, his rare insight into the process of social change and, above all, his unique faculty of analysis and interpretation are each reflected in his study which opens fresh vistas for the interpretation of socio-political history of modern India.  Lately the French historian Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie has studied the culture of the small French village Montaillou on the basis of Jacques Fouiern's Register's.  His work is rightly claimed as constituting a landmark in modern historiography.  No such work has so far been undertaken in India.  The newspapers from Mirzapur, Benaras, Meerut, Bareilly, Rampur, etc., brought to light by Khan, will hopefully one day attract scholars to undertake similar studies of the intellectual and social milieu of the Indian towns.  He prepared grounds for the utilization of journalistic literature for the reconstruction of the cultural history of India during the 19th century.  Due to his sermons and simple and modest lifestyle, Dr Nadir Ali Khan commands respect from Muslims all over the world.  He has a simple, eloquent and distinctive style of explaining the purpose of human life and its creation and often uses scientific examples to support his argument. He has delivered lectures to all types of communities in the society with the attendees being doctors, engineers, professors, businessmen, landlords, government officials, TV/film artists, ministers/politicians and sports celebrities. His untiring efforts brought real Islamic values in the lives of many Muslims.

The region likely derived its name from the Slavic tribe of the Baiounitai. It is first attested as a sclavinia under some sort of Byzantine control in the 8th/9th centuries, passed under Bulgarian rule in the late 9th century, and returned to Byzantine rule in the 11th. It passed to the Despotate of Epirus after 1204, where it formed a separate province. Vagenetia came under Albanian rule in the 1360s, until conquered by the Ottoman Empire in 1430.  History  The region's name derives from the Slavic tribe of the Baiounitai, who appear in the early 7th century during the Slavic invasions of the Balkans. Already during the 8th century, the Byzantine Empire tried to re-impose some control over the region, as a seal of office attests the presence of a civil governor (\"Theodore, basilikos spatharios and archon of Vagenitia\"), but the reading of the latter is not certain. Byzantine administration is securely attested towards the end of the 9th century, with the presence of both a bishop called Stephen in the Fourth Council of Constantinople in 879, and the seal of a civil governor (the basilikos protospatharios and archon Ilarion) from the turn of the 10th century.   The historian Predrag Komatina suggests that the bishopric was an \"ethnic\" bishopric for the Baiounitai (but with Greek-language liturgy), which then was succeeded by the Slavic-language episcopate of Clement of Ohrid (893\u2013916), which was not organized on a territorial, but on an ethnic basis, and had no fixed centre. Clement's roving episcopate was gradually replaced by bishoprics based in the various cities of the area. At the time of Clement's activity in the area, and during the early 10th century, Vagenetia and its wider area was ruled by the First Bulgarian Empire; thus the local church also became part of the Bulgarian Church, and later of the Archbishopric of Ohrid. The ultimate descendant of the bishopric of Vagenetia was likely the see of Himara.  Vagenetia is next mentioned in literary sources in the Alexiad, which describes how, in 1082, the Italo-Normans under Bohemund crossed the region to capture Ioannina. In the Partitio Romaniae of 1204, Vagenetia appears as a chartoularaton (a special district type indicating Slavic settlement) in the province of Dyrrhachium.   In 1205, it is listed by Marino Zeno, the Podest\u00e0 of Constantinople, among the territories accorded to the Republic of Venice by the Partitio. In Zeno's account, it is a separate province, distinct from Dyrrhachium, and in turn includes the chartoularaton of Glyky, north of Arta (which previously probably belonged to the Byzantine province of Nicopolis. Apart from the region of Dyrrhachium, however, the Venetians failed to consolidate their rule over most of the lands accorded to them in Epirus, and possession of Vagenetia passed to the Despotate of Epirus, where it is attested as a separate province (provincia in Latin, thema in Greek) within the Epirote state as early as the 1210 treaty between Michael I Komnenos Doukas and Venice.   In 1228, Theodore Komnenos Doukas confirmed possession of lands \"on the island of Corfu and the thema of Vagenetia\" to the Metropolitan of Corfu. In 1292, the coasts of the province were raided by Genoese ships in Byzantine employ, and two years later, the province was promised to Philip of Taranto as part of the dowry of Thamar Angelina Komnene. Still, the Despot of Epirus Thomas I Komnenos Doukas was ascribed the title of \"Duke of Vagenetia\" in a  Venetian document in 1313. In 1315, a document of the Patriarchate of Constantinople records that Vagenetia belonged to the bishopric of Himara.  During the Albanian invasions of Epirus in the 1360s, many of the local Greeks fled to Ioannina. In 1382, the Albanian ruler John Spata gave the region, along with Bela and Dryinopolis, to his son-in-law Marchesino. In the early 1400s, the local Albanian ruler John Zenevisi is referred to in some Venetian documents as the \"sebastokrator of Vagenetia\". His grandson, Simon Zenevisi, with Venetian backing built the fortress of Strovili \"at the cape of Vagenetia\" across the island of Corfu in 1443.  Most of Epirus fell under Ottoman rule in 1430, and in 1431, the Ottoman cadaster attests the existence of a province of Vayonetya. The name survived to the end of the century in various variants (Viyanite, Viyantiye), but the name vanishes thereafter, apart from a village Vagenetion south of Ioannina and an isolated reference to a \"Greater Vagenetia\" (\u03bc\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7 \u0392\u03b1\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03c4\u03af\u03b1) in the 17th century.  Geography According to the historian Stojan Novakovi\u0107, followed by Peter Soustal and Johannes Koder in the Tabula Imperii Byzantini, Vagenetia was the coastal strip between the Ionian Sea and the Pindus Mountains that extended from Himara in the north to Margariti in the south. However, Komatina objects that these boundaries reflect the situation in the 13th\u201314th centuries, and that the earlier, original region, the chartoularaton of Vagenetia, was much smaller. Komatina points out that after 1205, Vagenetia came to include the district of Glyky to the south, but the original territory was just the northern part of the expanded province. Komatina identifies this with the territory referred to by John Apokaukos as \"Lesser Vagenetia\" (\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03c1\u1f70 \u0392\u03b1\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03c4\u03af\u03b1), namely the area around the valley of the Ao\u00f6s. This also corresponds to the Ottoman province, which comprised Himara and its hinterlands, with Delvina as its centre.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"ADAPT Act\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Antibiotic Development to Advance Patient Treatment (ADAPT) Act () was introduced in the U.S. Congress on December 12, 2013 by Representative Phil Gingrey of Georgia and fifty-two cosponsors. Responding to the lack of financial incentives for drug manufacturers to innovate new antibiotics and antifungals and the regulatory barriers to their doing so, it proposed an expedited pathway for testing drugs intended for diseases for which no cure yet existed. After it died in committee, a similar version of the Act was re-introduced by Representative John Shimkus of Illinois and his cosponsor Representative Gene Green of Texas. Though this Act likewise failed to make it out of committee, several of its provisions were codified in the 21st Century Cures Act, which was signed into law on December 13, 2016. These include the expedited testing pathway for new antibiotics and a similar provision for antimicrobial susceptibility tests.  Background  Antibiotic resistance and the barriers to new treatments The cost of antibiotic resistance, in dollars and in lives, motivated the Act\u2019s sponsors and the community stakeholders that supported its passage. In September 2014, the Subcommittee on Health of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce held a hearing at which officials from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Pew Charitable Trusts, and other organizations testified in favor of the ADAPT and 21st Century Cures Acts. Opening the hearing, Subcommittee Chairman Joseph R. Pitts (R-PA) quoted then-Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s recent admonition that failure to \u201cconfront the threat of antibiotic resistance\u201d could \u201ccast [humanity] back into the dark ages.\u201d Speaking at this same hearing, Representative Phil Gingrey (R-GA) (the 2013 Act\u2019s principal sponsor) referenced Centers for Disease Control (CDC) statistics, which placed the number of Americans who die from drug-resistant infections each year at around 23,000. Representative Gingrey asserted that the financial losses from such infections amount to $55 billion annually. Representative John Shimkus (R-IL) would later note these same figures in a House debate over the Acts in July 2015.  Equally worrisome to the ADAPT Act\u2019s proponents were the economic and regulatory impediments to developing new treatments for drug-resistant illnesses. Citing the FDA, Representative Gingrey lamented during the 2014 hearing that \u201cnew antibiotic approval ha[d] decreased by 70 percent since the mid 1980s.\u201d Representative Michael C. Burgess (R-TX) likewise took issue with the \u201clack of a pipeline of new drugs\u201d to respond to the threat of super bugs. Several blamed inadequate market incentives for this paucity of remedies. As Dr. Barbara E. Murray, then-President of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, observed, \u201cAntibiotics are typically priced low [and] used for a short duration.\u201d Pharmaceutical companies can reap greater returns in other areas of research; hence, the development of new antibiotics flounders.  Compounding the scant financial motives for drug development, creators of new treatments were made to contend with \"serious regulatory barriers\". Dr. Murray observed that the small number of patients infected by novel diseases made it difficult for manufacturers to find enough test subjects in order to comply with federal agencies\u2019 n-count requirements. The unavailability of diagnostic tests for these new infectious agents also demanded a large investment to find eligible study participants, while generating little information about drug effectiveness. Stagnant innovation becomes self-perpetuating. The more antibiotics to which a pathogen becomes resistant, the fewer controls there are against which to measure an experimental treatment.  The GAIN Act In 2012, one of Congress\u2019s earliest attempts at rectifying these barriers to new drug-resistant antibiotics came in the form of the Generating Antibiotics Now (GAIN) Act. GAIN was passed as an amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act. Its strategy for generating new antibiotics is to offer manufacturers an artificial monopoly on any qualifying drugs that they produce. Such drugs must treat illnesses with \u201cthe potential to pose a serious threat to the public health.\u201d However, beyond this blanket criterion, GAIN gave significant deference to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (the Secretary). This latitude was subject only to the requirements that she consider a given pathogen\u2019s \u201cimpact on public health\u201d and \u201cmorbidity and mortality rates\u201d and consult with the CDC, FDA, and the medical community. Manufacturers who satisfied GAIN\u2019s conditions were guaranteed five years of market exclusivity over the pertinent drug. These years could stack with the drug\u2019s \u201cfive year exclusivity as a new chemical entity (NCE), three year clinical investigation exclusivity, and seven-year orphan drug exclusivity.\u201d Moreover, any qualifying drugs were eligible for fast-track review.  GAIN\u2019s value proposition proved to be an effective one. As Representative Frank Pallone (D-NJ) commented during the 2014 ADAPT Act hearing, within two years, GAIN had led to FDA approval of numerous new antibiotics. The expedited review procedure further ensured that these drugs would be \u201cable to combat an imminent infectious disease threat and reach patients at an accelerated pace\". At the same time, Representative Pallone and others were concerned about the consumer harms that these decades of exclusivity might yield. Representative Henry A. Waxman (D-CA) warned that exclusivity \u201callow[s drug companies] to charge higher prices,\u201d which \u201cimposes a significant burden on patients and on the healthcare system overall.\u201d To justify \u201cthe carrot of marketing and regulatory exclusivities,\u201d Representative Pallone exhorted his fellow members of Congress to ensure that their efforts \u201cachieve[] the necessary impact on the pipeline of new drugs.\u201d  Provisions  Purpose and Scope The ADAPT Act complemented GAIN. Representative Gingrey introduced it to the House as the \u201clogical next step to the GAIN Act.\u201d To that end, it did not merely render the development of new treatments more lucrative but more feasible as well. The centerpiece of this proposal was ADAPT\u2019s creation of a Limited Population Antibacterial Drug (LPAD) approval pathway for certain antibiotics. Faced with a disease of sufficient severity for which alternatives do not yet exist, ADAPT would empower the Secretary to dispense with the usual testing requirements and allow manufacturers to go to market based on more limited efficacy tests. As Allan Coukell, Director of Drug, Medical Device, and Food Programs at the Pew Charitable Trusts, observed, a patient with mutli-drug-resistant pneumonia will likely die without access to a new antibiotic. In that case, the uncertainty of an unproven remedy was preferable to the near certainty of death. In conducting such a risk-benefit assessment, ADAPT allowed the FDA to \u201caccept less data\u201d in approving a lifesaving drug. As Representative Shimkus later commended, this \u201cnew, streamlined pathway\u201d saved \u201cthousands of lives\u201d by making experimental drugs available to those who would otherwise have no cure.  Given the uncertainty inherent in drugs approved via LPAD, ADAPT\u2019s advocates were careful to constrain its reach to \u201chigh-need populations\u201d suffering from the gravest threats. Dr. Janet Woodcock, Director of the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, claimed that ADAPT would be restricted to \u201crare resistant organisms where there are really very few treatment options available.\u201d Within the population of patients affected by these diseases, the Act\u2019s application would be further constrained to \u201cthe limited population in most need of the therapy, as opposed to all patients.\u201d As such, ADAPT would not lower the federal review standard for new drugs, but merely contour it to the needs of \u201ca specific population that is different from the general population.\u201d  Relationship Between the 2013 and 2015 Acts The two versions of the ADAPT Act\u2014H.R. 3742 (2013) and H.R. 2629 (2015)\u2014contain the same three overriding provisions discussed above. Both would amend Section 505 of FD&C (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355) to formally include the expedited testing pathway. Each prescribes certain labeling requirements for manufacturers and charges the Secretary of Health and Human Services with conducting the aforementioned breakpoint review. Under a modification to Title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 247b-22), the Secretary is also to monitor \u201cthe use of antibacterial and antifungal drugs\u201d as well as \u201c[c]hanges in bacterial and fungal resistance to drugs.\u201d This new responsibility of the Secretary encompasses drugs approved both through LPAD as well as the standard procedure. The results of the Secretary\u2019s resistance analysis, like the breakpoint research, are to be made public.  The 2013 and 2015 Acts differed slightly in scope and the precise process they envisioned. Under the 2013 Act, the Secretary could approve drugs to treat \u201ca limited population of patients for which there is an unmet need,\u201d based on her assessment of either traditional comprehensive studies, \u201cdatasets of limited size,\u201d \u201csuch other confirmatory evidence as [she] deems necessary,\u201d or some combination of the above. The 2015 version expands this list of sources of proof, holding that the Secretary may consult nonclinical tests\u2014assessments not conducted on humans\u2014in deciding on whether to approve a drug.  At the same time, this later version limited the Act\u2019s applicability via a purpose statement with language evocative of a sliding scale. The Act serves to \u201chelp expedite the development and availability of treatments for serious or life-threatening bacterial or fungal infections,\u201d but this goal depends on \u201cthe severity of the infection and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.\u201d Furthermore, the 2015 Act contained a new precondition. In this version of the legislation, the Secretary did not simply decide what level of proof would be necessary for a drug\u2019s approval but actively collaborated with the manufacturer to create a \u201cwritten agreement\u201d that stipulated the necessary evidence. Only if such an agreement is reached may the Secretary approve the drug via the LPAD pathway. To the end of reaching this agreement, the 2015 Act provides for consultative meetings between manufacturers and the Secretary.  In regard to labeling, the 2013 Act would have mandated that LPAD drugs bear the warning label noted above: \u201cThis drug is indicated for use in a limited and specific population of patients.\u201d However, on its terms, this requirement applied only to the drug\u2019s \u201cprescribing information\u201d\u2014not necessarily to its packaging or bottle. The 2015 Act broadened the labeling provision. In addition to the warning on prescriptions, this version entailed placing a label on the product itself that states \u201cLimited Population\u201d and features \u201cin a prominent manner . . . adjacent to . . . the brand name of the product.\u201d  Finally, the 2015 version of the Act expanded its applicability relative to the prior version. For one, it allowed the Secretary to expand LPAD to new arenas outside its original superbug context. Should she determine \u201cthat the public health would benefit from expansion of the limited-use pathway,\u201d other medical areas may be subsumed within the Act\u2019s expedited provisions. Secondly, it pulls antimicrobial susceptibility tests into the LPAD pathway. So long as a given test satisfies the exigency conditions for antimicrobial drug treatments, \u201cthe Secretary may authorize the marketing of such device\u201d under LPAD\u2014subject to cautionary labeling requirements.  Limitations  Kevin Khachatryan noted, that the ADAPT Act did not impose responsibilities for Antimicrobial stewardship for antibiotics developed under this pathway.\u201d Coupled with the incentive for manufacturers to produce all that they can during their monopoly window, \u201c[t]his can lead to overuse of these antibiotics and contribute to resistant microbes.\u201d Additionally, the Act placed a premium of speed while sidelining other objectives of testing, namely diverse representation among test subjects. This could impede the gathering of data about certain populations respond to experimental drugs, namely \u201cwomen, children, and [the] elderly.\u201d  Incorporation into the 21st Century Cures Act  The day Representative Gingrey and fifty-two cosponsors introduced the ADAPT Act, it was referred to the Subcommittee on Health. It never left. A little over a year later, Representative Shimkus, joined by cosponsor Gene Green (D-TX), resuscitated the Act. Again, it died in committee. Nevertheless, \u201c[m]any of [its] provisions were ultimately incorporated into the 21st Century Cures Act [Cures Act].\" A bipartisan effort ranging from such varied policy areas as Medicare savings to tick-borne diseases, the Cures Act was signed into law three years and a day after the ADAPT Act\u2019s initial proposal.  Section 3042 (concerning the \u201cexpedited testing of new antibacterial and antifungal drugs\u201d) of the Cures Act derives nearly verbatim from the 2015 ADAPT Act. At the request of a drug manufacturer, the Secretary may approve a given medication based on substandard data\u2014provided that it \u201cis intended to treat a serious or life-threatening infection in a limited population of patients with unmet needs.\u201d However, in the vein of the 2015 ADAPT Act\u2019s purpose statement, Section 3042 requires the Secretary to balance the benefits of expedited remedies against their costs. Drugs approved under the Cures Act\u2019s LPAD pathway are subject to much the same labeling requirements as under the ADAPT Act. All labeling and advertising associated with such medications \u201cshall contain the statement \u2018Limited Population\u2019 in a prominent manner and adjacent to . . . the proprietary name of such drug.\u201d Section 3044 underscores the Secretary\u2019s ability to update and issue new susceptibility criteria for antimicrobial drugs and her requirement make this information public. Finally, Section 3043 includes similar language (relative to the 2015 ADAPT Act) in regard to the expedited production of new ASTs and their labeling requirements.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Koupaki, Phocis\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Koupaki or Koupakio (Greek: \u039a\u03bf\u03c5\u03c0\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9 or \u039a\u03bf\u03c5\u03c0\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd) is a Greek village in the municipal unit of Vardousia, located in the northwestern part of Phocis, west of the Mornos dam and 5\u00a0km from Krokyleio, the former seat of Vardousia. Population: 65 (2011 census). In recent years, very few remain during winter months but over 200 during summer months.  Geography   Much of the area is mountainous, forested (oaks and pines) and pastureland suitable for livestock production, although in earlier times mixed livestock and crop cultivation was extensively practiced. The village lies on the east-facing side of colline Pyrgos. A couple of small streams pass through the village but are dry most of the year except during the rainy winter season.  At over  altitude, it gets snow nearly every winter but overall the village enjoys mild winters and a very attractive climate year round.  History   Based on historical accounts from the greater area, Koupaki was inhabited before 2000 B.C. by the Pelasgians, who were then invaded by the Dorians whose presence for a long time gave the name Dorida to the greater region. The Aetolians followed from the 13th century B.C. onwards and the area was later invaded by Achaeans, Macedonians, Galatians, Romans and Goths culminating with the destruction of the ancient city of Doris. Later, it was the turn of the Slavs, the Bulgarians, the Catalans, Normans and finally the Ottoman Turks, with the fall of Constantinople in 1453 A.D.  Until about 200 A.D. religious beliefs in the greater area were dominated by idol worshiping and polytheism. The Oracle of Delphi exerted considerable influence throughout the Greek world as a source of wise counsel or prophetic opinion, usually spiritual in nature. It is of no surprise that Christianity could not easily match the infallible authority of the oracle and it is said that it took over 100 years for the region to accept the new dogma.  For nearly 400 years under Ottoman occupation, poor and mountainous villages like Koupaki were not favorite places for the Turks. However, a location near Koupaki which is known as Maraveli was at some period during the Ottoman occupation the \"property\" of a Turk with the likely name Omar Avel or Abel (from whom the area apparently took its name).  It is said that the Maraveli area was used as pastureland for livestock to supply the needs of the Turk who resided in one of the larger towns of the Mornos valley to the south, as the Turks preferred wealthier and more fertile areas as well as the security and social structure offered by larger towns. In fact, this relative isolation and ethnic purity of mountainous people like Koupaki brought with it pride and a sense of purity and superiority relative to those of the lowlands. Although the latter had no alternative but to cohabitate with the Turks, this was considered as capitulation and as shameful compromise by the mountainous people.  The Greek War of Independence in 1821  against the Ottoman Turks found the rugged mountainous villages in the forefront of the revolution. On October 1828 Dorida was finally liberated and the province of Sterea Hellas (literally the 'Solid Greece') together with the Peloponnese in the south comprised the new Greek Nation.   In 1837, less than 10 years after liberation, Koupaki was recognized as an independent community by the Greek government and became part of the municipality of Krokyleion. Koupaki is referred to as a distinct community for the first time around 1800 by the French Historian and traveler Charles Pouqueville, who refers to the village as Copaki.  The present location of the village formed the nucleus for smaller settlements around it.  Slowly the inhabitants of these peripheral settlements moved to the main central village location.  In addition, starting around 1830 the village saw an influx of people from the area around the town of Missolonghi, to the west of Sterea Hellas. The town's heroic resistance to the Turks, who besieged it twice both from the sea and land in the mid-1820s, became a legend. The descriptions of heroism from the besieged city moved all Greeks, including Koupaki, to open their welcoming arms; but it also reached far away places and several world personalities of the time came to the town's rescue. Among them was the acclaimed British poet Lord Byron, who fought and died in  Missolonghi in 1826. The few from  Missolonghi who survived the daring exodus in 1826, took to the mountains and several arrived at Koupaki and other villages of Dorida. Some of the newcomers from  Missolonghi actually originated from the region of Epirus, a ragged mountainous region in the north-west of Greece. They had moved south into the province of Sterea Hellas, already fighting for its independence, in order to assist the war and breath the first air of freedom.  By 1845 the construction of the main village church had started, exclusively with the local gray stone and oak beams.  This work was completed by means of personal voluntary labour offered by men and women. The engravings seen today on cornerstones of the church are still immensely inspiring. They reflect deep spirituality and a tribute to the institution that preserved Orthodoxy and the Greek language and culture for almost 400 years.  Towards the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th, a large number of young men from Koupaki headed for the New World.  Many of them worked in building the railway network in America, others served in the restaurant business, a tradition that lasted for a long time.  They left with the intention to return but many of them never did and many more from their extended family and friends followed their path.  This was the beginning of the gradual decay of the village which accelerated further during the 1920s and 1940s with new destinations such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand.  The people   Family names in Koupaki, as elsewhere in rural Greece and beyond, were formed by a combination of the father's first name (e.g. Panos) and the offspring's own name (e.g. Kostas). So the offspring would be known as Panokostas and this would often be adopted as the family name for that branch of the family. Similarly, Mitros an offspring of Giannis would go by the name Giannomitros, etc. If the father was more prominent in the community and known as a craftsman or held an official position, the father's trade could often become the first part of the family name e.g. for a priest (Papas in Greek) carrying the name Andreas, the family name would become Papandreas.   Finally, physical characteristics would also play a role in giving family names. For example, if Andreas happened to be relatively short (Kontos in Greek), his family name could become Kontoandreas (hence, the origin of the family name Konandreas). At Koupaki there were about 5-6 original families with these long composite family names who formed the nucleus of the village. Those were the families of Giannomitros, Kolimparis, Konandreas, Koufasimes, Nasiopoulos and Tsatouhas. Those who came from Messologi and Epirus after 1826, had two-syllable names e.g. Goumas, Nitsos, Soulias, Tsipras, Zohos, Zoupas, Zakkas etc.  The two World Wars and the Greek Civil War, following World War II, took a great toll on Koupaki, both in terms of life lost and material destruction.  From 329 inhabitants in 1940, only 187 had remained in 1951, partly as a result of war casualties and partly due to immigration. The village was never to regain its old past and by the end of the 1950s and 1960s, most of those that had remained left for the cities (mainly Athens). By the 1970 census, only 51 inhabitants were registered. All along, education was seen as the only real escape from the hardships of village life and most families sacrificed everything to see their children finishing school and entering university. This has not been in vain; Koupaki has one of the highest per capita university graduates in Greece.  The village has never lost the hearts and minds of its people wherever they may be and many of them (including from far away places such as California and New Zealand) converge to it, especially during the summer months, to remember the past and enjoy the fresh mountain air. Most of the houses, stone-built, have been renovated to benefit from modern amenities.  The village was connected to the regional road network in 1952 (dirt road) which was paved asphalt in the 1990s.  Electricity reached the village in the 1970s and the 1970s brought also individual telephone connection (until then the village was served by a single telephone located in the main grocery store in the centre of the village).  Koupaki has a beautiful church (Agios Georgios) and had a functioning elementary school until it closed in 1957 (because of the limited number of students who then were obliged to attend school at the nearby village of Zorianos). The school is now used as a museum for local arts and crafts. Koupaki is the birthplace of prominent individuals who excelled in the sciences, public life, international organizations and in business.  Contemporary news about Koupaki are printed in the quarterly 'To Koupaki mas' (Greek: \u03a4\u03bf \u039a\u03bf\u03c5\u03c0\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9 \u03bc\u03b1\u03c2) published by the Koupaki community in Athens and distributed to the four corners of the world. News about Koupaki can also be found in the village website (in Greek). The village is  featured in the book \"Better Dead Than Divorced: The Trial of Panayota\" by  Lukas Thanasis Konandreas which describes the murder of his father's cousin Panayota Nitsos by her abusive husband in the 1950s and her family's efforts to bring the murderers to justice. The book won the 2015 Bronze Nonfiction Book Award.

In 2011 its population was 1,328. It is situated on the eastern slope of Mount Giona, above the valley of the Cephissus river. It is 5 km (3 mi) west of Gravia, 12 km (7 mi) southeast of Amfissa, and 25 km (16 mi) north of Levadi. The area has been inhabited since ancient times. A tomb from the Mycenaean period (16th century BC) has been discovered in the area. The village was mentioned in the 11th century by Anna Komnene. During the Byzantine period, the area was subject to frequent barbarian invasions, and the population often retreated to the safety of the mountains. The village was entirely destroyed in 1382 by the Aydinids. The old church of Koupaki is dedicated to Saint George, and is built at the edge of the cliff, under which are rock-cut tombs. It is a single-aisle basilica with a wooden roof, and dates to 1704. The new church, dedicated to the Dormition of the Virgin, is a three-aisle basilica with a tall wooden dome, built in 1888. Koupaki was the seat of a Commonwealth, which was established in 1665. The first major battle of the Greek War of Independence took place in Koupaki on the 17th of March 1821.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 20263826}

As a result, the area has been the scene of many international crises, including several major wars. The earliest known conflict in the Mediterranean region was the Trojan War, which occurred in the early Bronze Age. The war was fought between the kingdoms of Troy and Mycenaean Greece and was recorded in the works of Homer, including the Iliad and the Odyssey. The conflict is generally dated to the late Bronze Age, with a conventional date of around 1200 BC. In the early Iron Age, the Mediterranean region was home to a number of powerful city-states, including Athens, Sparta, and Corinth. The Peloponnesian War, which was fought between Athens and Sparta from 431 BC to 404 BC, was one of the most significant conflicts in the region during this period. The war featured a number of major battles, including the Battle of Thermopylae and the Battle of 404 BC, and resulted in the defeat of Athens and the rise of Sparta as the dominant power in the region. The Roman Republic became the dominant power in the Mediterranean region in the first century BC, and the Roman Empire maintained control of the region for much of the next thousand years. The collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the fifth century AD was followed by a period of fragmentation, with a number of smaller states emerging in the region. In the seventh century, the Islamic conquest of the Middle East and North Africa brought much of the region under the control of the Caliphates. The Muslim states of Spain and Sicily also emerged as significant powers in the Mediterranean during this period. In the eleventh and twelfth centuries, the Mediterranean region was the scene of a number of major religious wars, including the Crusades and the Barbary Wars. The Crusades were a series of religious wars between the Christian Crusaders and the Muslim Turks, and resulted in the recapture of the Holy Land from Muslim control. The Barbary Wars were fought between the Christian Europeans and the Muslim pirates of North Africa, and resulted in the gradual decline of the Barbary States. The Mediterranean region was also the scene of a number of major naval conflicts, including the Russo-Turkish War, the War of the Third Coalition, and the Battle of Lepanto. The Russo-Turkish War was fought between the Russian Empire and the Ottoman Empire in the 1850s, and resulted in the defeat of the Ottomans and the rise of the Russians as a major power in the region. The War of the Third Coalition was fought between the British Empire, the Austrian Empire, and the Kingdom of Prussia against the First French Empire and the Kingdom of Spain in the early 1800s, and resulted in the defeat of the French and the rise of the British and Austrians as major powers in the region. The Battle of Lepanto was fought between the Holy League and the Ottoman Empire in the late 1500s, and resulted in the defeat of the Ottomans and the rise of the Holy League as the dominant power in the region.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 56190444}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Inn Valley Autobahn\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Inn Valley Motorway or Inntal Autobahn A12 is an autobahn in the Austrian federal state of Tyrol and part of Euroroutes E45 and E60.  It begins as a continuation of the German Bundesautobahn 93 on the German-Austrian border near Kiefersfelden/Kufstein and runs via Innsbruck (intersection with the Brenner Autobahn A13) to Zams, where it transitions to the S16 Arlberg expressway (Arlberg Schnellstra\u00dfe). It runs parallel to the River Inn and runs through the Inn Valley fresh air region (Luftsanierungsgebiet).  Importance  The Kufstein\u2013Innsbruck section, together with the Brenner Autobahn and the German A93 and A8, form the main transport axis from Munich over the Alps to Verona and Modena. In addition the A12 links Tyrol via the so-called German Corner (Deutsches Eck) to Salzburg and the West Autobahn (A1) to Vienna.  The A12 was the first autobahn in Austria that was equipped with an intelligent transportation system. These overhead signs provide information to the motorist on every type of situation (road conditions, traffic, weather, etc.) as well as speed limits.  During summer vacation period 2019, every weekend from mid-June to mid-September, on the section around Innsbruck as well as on A13 (Austria) Brenner Autobahn it is not allowed to leave the motorway in case of traffic jams. This measure is a controversial issue. The most important reason is to protect the local population suffering from the consequences of the denser traffic on rural roads leading parallel to the motorway. This kind of evasion traffic leads to another congestions, noise and pollution. On the other hand, local hotel and restaurant owners are worried about forfeits. Furthermore, whoever wants to avoid the traffic jam will find a pretext for his intention to leave the motorway in case of an inquiry by the Austrian police. However, there is no obligation to show a confirmation for a hotel reservation along the road.  Geschichte  Der Ostast der Inntal Autobahn von Kufstein bis zum Knoten Innsbruck-Amras wurde in Etappen zwischen 1968 und 1972 er\u00f6ffnet, die Anschlussstellen in Innsbruck in den 1970er Jahren und der Westast in den 1980er Jahren. Der Roppener Tunnel wurde erst 1990 fertiggestellt.  Im Juli 1990 musste die \u201eWildbichler Br\u00fccke\u201c f\u00fcr l\u00e4ngere Zeit gesperrt werden, da ein Br\u00fcckenpfeiler im Inn absackte. W\u00e4hrend dieser Zeit musste der gesamte Autobahn- und Hauptstra\u00dfenverkehr durch die Kufsteiner Innenstadt umgeleitet werden, auch die Unterinntalbahn der \u00d6BB war zeitweise gesperrt.  Im Jahr 2000 wurde als erste Kontrollstelle \u00d6sterreichs die Kontrollstelle in Kundl in Fahrtrichtung Innsbruck in Betrieb genommen. Sie war als Provisorium geplant, wurde jedoch ein Jahr sp\u00e4ter ausgebaut.  Am 1.\u00a0Mai 2001 kam es auf der A12 bei Vomp zu einem schweren Busungl\u00fcck. Ein Gelenkbus kam aufgrund von Spurrillen ins Schleudern, kippte um, durchbrach die Mittelleitplanke und blieb quer zur Fahrbahn liegen. Acht Insassen kamen ums Leben, 51 wurden zum Teil schwer verletzt. Bei den schwierigen Bergungsarbeiten waren mehr als 330\u00a0Rettungskr\u00e4fte im Einsatz. Beide Fahrtrichtungen waren mehrere Stunden gesperrt.  Am 25.\u00a0April 2005 wurde die Kontrollstelle Radfeld er\u00f6ffnet. Damit k\u00f6nnen beide Fahrtrichtungen der A12 kontrolliert werden. Der Polizei steht als Dienststelle die Kontrollstelle Radfeld mit ihren R\u00e4umlichkeiten zur Verf\u00fcgung.  Im August 2005 wurde aufgrund eines extremen Hochwassers ein mehr als 30\u00a0km langes Teilst\u00fcck der A12 von der bayrisch-\u00f6sterreichischen Grenze bis Kramsach gesperrt, weil f\u00fcr die \u201eKufstein-Br\u00fccke\u201c bei Kufstein-Kiefersfelden ein Einsturz wegen Untersp\u00fclung bef\u00fcrchtet wurde. Nach einigen Tagen konnte diese Gefahr jedoch nicht best\u00e4tigt werden und die Sperre wurde wieder aufgehoben.  Anfang Dezember 2006 wurde die nicht unumstrittene Anschlussstelle Innsbruck-Mitte er\u00f6ffnet, sie erm\u00f6glicht den D\u00f6rfern des \u00f6stlichen Mittelgebirges eine schnellere Anbindung an die Autobahn.  Am 17. Dezember 2010 wurden der zweir\u00f6hrige Betrieb des Roppener Tunnels und die Nordr\u00f6hre der Einhausung Amras freigegeben.  Derzeitige Ausbauvorhaben betreffen den Zubringer Tschirganttunnel zur Fernpassstra\u00dfeFernpassstrecke und einen teilweisen dreispurigen Ausbau je Fahrtrichtung des stark belasteten Ostastes im Unterinntal. Beide Ma\u00dfnahmen sind jedoch umstritten.  Kontrollstellen   Aufgrund der positiven Auswirkungen auf die Verkehrssicherheit seit der Inbetriebnahme der ersten Kontrollstelle in Kundl hat sich der Tiroler Landtag 2003 zur Umsetzung des Tiroler Kontrollstellenkonzeptes entschlossen und 2004 mit der ASFINAG einen Vertrag zur Errichtung der KOST Radfeld abgeschlossen. Im August 2004 wurde mit dem Bau f\u00fcr das 4,6\u00a0Mio. teure Projekt begonnen und im Fr\u00fchjahr 2005 vollendet.  Die Ausleitung von der A12 auf die jeweilige Kontrollstelle wurde in die Verkehrsbeeinflussungsanlage integriert, eine automatische Stauerkennung ist ebenso m\u00f6glich wie eine angepasste Geschwindigkeitsanzeige. Zu den Aufgaben der Kontrollstellen geh\u00f6ren haupts\u00e4chlich die Kontrolle von LKWs und Bussen bez\u00fcglich der Einhaltung der zul\u00e4ssigen H\u00f6chstgewichte, der sozialrechtlichen und stra\u00dfenrechtlichen Vorschriften, des technischen Zustands der Fahrzeuge und der richtige Deklaration und Kennzeichnung von Gefahrguttransporten. Bei Kontrollen des Schwerverkehrs aber auch den Personenverkehrs finden zus\u00e4tzlich Alkoholkontrollen und Kontrollen der Sicherheitseinrichtungen (Gurtenpflicht, Kindersicherung) statt.

It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of Templeport and barony of Tullyhaw.  Geography  Cavanaquill is bounded on the north by Urhannagh townland, on the west by Munlough South and Lissanover townlands, on the east by Killynaff townland and on the south by Tonyhallagh and Crossmakelagher townlands. Cavanaquill's chief geographical features are a small stream and cow pastures. It is traversed by rural lanes. The townland covers 102 statute acres.  History  The Plantation of Ulster 1609 Baronial Map depicts the townland as Cavanekilly. The 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the townland as Cavancuill. A deed dated 10 May 1744 spells the name as Cavanacull.  An 1808 map of ecclesiastical lands in Templeport depicts the townland as Cavanagh Hill.  In the Plantation of Ulster by grant dated 4 June 1611, along with other lands, King James VI and I granted one poll of Cavanaquill to Donill Backagh McShane O'Reyly, gentleman. He was a nephew of the O'Reilly Clan chief, Aodh Connallach mac Maolmhordha who ruled from 1565\u20131583. His genealogy is Domhnall Bacach son of Sea\u00e1n son of Maol M\u00f3rdha (d. 1565) son of Sea\u00e1n (d.1516) son of Cathal (d.1467) son of E\u00f3ghan na F\u00e9s\u00f3ige (d.1449).  O'Reilly later sold the land to Walter Talbot of Ballyconnell. Walter Talbot died on 26 June 1625 at Ballyconnell and his son James Talbot succeeded to the Ballyconnell estate aged just 10 years. An Inquisition held in Cavan on 20 September 1630 found that James Talbot was seized of one poll of Cavanickehall, along with other lands. James Talbot married Helen Calvert, the daughter of George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore of Maryland, USA, in 1635. In the aftermath of the Irish Rebellion of 1641 James Talbot's estate was confiscated because he was a Catholic and he was granted an estate in 1655 at Castle Rubey, County Roscommon instead. He died in 1687. Talbot's land in Cavanaquill was distributed as follows-  The 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the proprietor as being Lieutenant John Blackforde who also appears as proprietor for several other Templeport townlands in the same survey. His subsequent history can be found under the townland of Bofealan.   The 1790 Cavan Carvaghs list spells the townland name as Cavan Quill.  The Tithe Applotment Books for 1827 list  twelve tithepayers in the townland.  The Cavanaquill Valuation Office Field books are available for December 1839.  Griffith's Valuation of 1857 lists five landholders in the townland.  Census  In the 1901 census of Ireland, there are two families listed in the townland, and in the 1911 census of Ireland, there are still two families listed in the townland.  Antiquities  The 1836 Ordnance Survey Namebooks state- The remains of an old Danish fort.  The chief structure of historical interest in the townland is an earthen ringfort.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Seismometer\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "A seismometer is an instrument that responds to ground noises and shaking such as caused by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and explosions. They are usually combined with a timing device and a recording device to form a seismograph. The output of such a device\u2014formerly recorded on paper (see picture) or film, now recorded and processed digitally\u2014is a seismogram. Such data is used to locate and characterize earthquakes, and to study the Earth's internal structure.  Basic principles  A simple seismometer, sensitive to up-down motions of the Earth, is like a weight hanging from a spring, both suspended from a frame that moves along with any motion detected. The relative motion between the weight (called the mass) and the frame provides a measurement of the vertical ground motion. A rotating drum is attached to the frame and a pen is attached to the weight, thus recording any ground motion in a seismogram.  Any movement from the ground moves the frame.  The mass tends not to move because of its inertia, and by measuring the movement between the frame and the mass, the motion of the ground can be determined.  Early seismometers used optical levers or mechanical linkages to amplify the small motions involved, recording on soot-covered paper or photographic paper. Modern instruments use electronics.  In some systems, the mass is held nearly motionless relative to the frame by an electronic negative feedback loop.  The motion of the mass relative to the frame is measured, and the feedback loop applies a magnetic or electrostatic force to keep the mass nearly motionless. The voltage needed to produce this force is the output of the seismometer, which is recorded digitally.  In other systems the weight is allowed to move, and its motion produces an electrical charge in a coil attached to the mass which voltage moves through the magnetic field of a magnet attached to the frame. This design is often used in a geophone, which is used in exploration for oil and gas.  Seismic observatories usually have instruments measuring three axes: north-south (y-axis), east-west (x-axis), and vertical (z-axis). If only one axis is measured, it is usually the vertical because it is less noisy and gives better records of some seismic waves.  The foundation of a seismic station is critical. A professional station is sometimes mounted on bedrock.  The best mountings may be in deep boreholes, which avoid thermal effects, ground noise and tilting from weather and tides.  Other instruments are often mounted in insulated enclosures on small buried piers of unreinforced concrete. Reinforcing rods and aggregates would distort the pier as the temperature changes.  A site is always surveyed for ground noise with a temporary installation before pouring the pier and laying conduit. Originally, European seismographs were placed in a particular area after a destructive earthquake. Today, they are spread to provide appropriate coverage (in the case of weak-motion seismology) or concentrated in high-risk regions (strong-motion seismology).  Nomenclature  The word derives from the Greek \u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2, seism\u00f3s, a shaking or quake, from the verb \u03c3\u03b5\u03af\u03c9, se\u00ed\u014d, to shake; and \u03bc\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd, m\u00e9tron, to measure, and was coined by David Milne-Home in 1841, to describe an instrument designed by Scottish physicist James David Forbes.  Seismograph is another Greek term from seism\u00f3s and \u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03c9, gr\u00e1ph\u014d, to draw.  It is often used to mean seismometer, though it is more applicable to the older instruments in which the measuring and recording of ground motion were combined, than to modern systems, in which these functions are separated. Both types provide a continuous record of ground motion; this record distinguishes them from seismoscopes, which merely indicate that motion has occurred, perhaps with some simple measure of how large it was.  The technical discipline concerning such devices is called seismometry, a branch of seismology.  The concept of measuring the \"shaking\" of something means that the word \"seismograph\" might be used in a more general sense.  For example, a monitoring station that tracks changes in electromagnetic noise affecting amateur radio waves presents an rf seismograph.  And helioseismology studies the \"quakes\" on the Sun.  History  The first seismometer was made in China during the 2nd century. It was invented by Zhang Heng, a Chinese mathematician and astronomer. The first Western description of the device comes from the French physicist and priest Jean de Hautefeuille in 1703. The modern seismometer was developed in the 19th century.  Luigi Palmieri invented an electromagnetic seismograph in 1856 that could record the time of an earthquake.  In December 2018, a seismometer was deployed on the planet Mars by the InSight lander, the first time a seismometer was placed onto the surface of another planet.  Ancient era  In AD 132, Zhang Heng of China's Han dynasty invented the first seismoscope (by the definition above), which was called Houfeng Didong Yi (translated as, \"instrument for measuring the seasonal winds and the movements of the Earth\"). The description we have, from the History of the Later Han Dynasty, says that it was a large bronze vessel, about 2 meters in diameter; at eight points around the top were dragon's heads holding bronze balls.  When there was an earthquake, one of the dragons' mouths would open and drop its ball into a bronze toad at the base, making a sound and supposedly showing the direction of the earthquake. On at least one occasion, probably at the time of a large earthquake in Gansu in AD 143, the seismoscope indicated an earthquake even though one was not felt. The available text says that inside the vessel was a central column that could move along eight tracks; this is thought to refer to a pendulum, though it is not known exactly how this was linked to a mechanism that would open only one dragon's mouth. The first earthquake recorded by this seismoscope was supposedly \"somewhere in the east\". Days later, a rider from the east reported this earthquake.  Modern designs  By the 13th century, seismographic devices existed in the Maragheh observatory in Persia. French physicist and priest Jean de Hautefeuille built one in 1703, and James Lind built one (known as an earthquake machine) in the late 1790s.  After 1880, most seismometers were descended from those developed by the team of John Milne, James Alfred Ewing and Thomas Gray, who worked as foreign-government advisors in Japan from 1880 to 1895.  These seismometers used damped horizontal pendulums.  After World War II, these were adapted into the widely used Press-Ewing seismometer.  An early special-purpose seismometer consisted of a large, stationary pendulum, with a stylus on the bottom.  As the earth started to move, the heavy mass of the pendulum had the inertia to stay still within the frame.  The result is that the stylus scratched a pattern corresponding with the Earth's movement. This type of strong-motion seismometer recorded upon a smoked glass (glass with carbon soot). While not sensitive enough to detect distant earthquakes, this instrument could indicate the direction of the pressure waves and thus help find the epicenter of a local quake. Such instruments were useful in the analysis of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Further analysis was performed in the 1980s, using these early recordings, enabling a more precise determination of the initial fault break location in Marin county and its subsequent progression, mostly to the south.  Later, professional suites of instruments for the worldwide standard seismographic network had one set of instruments tuned to oscillate at fifteen seconds, and the other at ninety seconds, each set measuring in three directions.  Amateurs or observatories with limited means tuned their smaller, less sensitive instruments to ten seconds. The basic damped horizontal pendulum seismometer swings like the gate of a fence.  A heavy weight is mounted on the point of a long (from 10\u00a0cm to several meters) triangle, hinged at its vertical edge.  As the ground moves, the weight stays unmoving, swinging the \"gate\" on the hinge.  The advantage of a horizontal pendulum is that it achieves very low frequencies of oscillation in a compact instrument.  The \"gate\" is slightly tilted, so the weight tends to slowly return to a central position.  The pendulum is adjusted (before the damping is installed) to oscillate once per three seconds, or once per thirty seconds.  The general-purpose instruments of small stations or amateurs usually oscillate once per ten seconds.  A pan of oil is placed under the arm, and a small sheet of metal mounted on the underside of the arm drags in the oil to damp oscillations. The level of oil, position on the arm, and angle and size of sheet is adjusted until the damping is \"critical\", that is, almost having oscillation.  The hinge is very low friction, often torsion wires, so the only friction is the internal friction of the wire.  Small seismographs with low proof masses are placed in a vacuum to reduce disturbances from air currents.  Zollner described torsionally suspended horizontal pendulums as early as 1869, but developed them for gravimetry rather than seismometry.  Early seismometers had an arrangement of levers on jeweled bearings, to scratch smoked glass or paper.  Later, mirrors reflected a light beam to a direct-recording plate or roll of photographic paper.  Briefly, some designs returned to mechanical movements to save money.  In mid-twentieth-century systems, the light was reflected to a pair of differential electronic photosensors called a photomultiplier.  The voltage generated in the photomultiplier was used to drive galvanometers which had a small mirror mounted on the axis.  The moving reflected light beam would strike the surface of the turning drum, which was covered with photo-sensitive paper.  The expense of developing photo-sensitive paper caused many seismic observatories to switch to ink or thermal-sensitive paper.  Modern instruments  Modern instruments use electronic sensors, amplifiers, and recording devices. Most are broadband covering a wide range of frequencies. Some seismometers can measure motions with frequencies from 500\u00a0Hz to 0.00118\u00a0Hz (1/500 = 0.002 seconds per cycle, to 1/0.00118 = 850 seconds per cycle).  The mechanical suspension for horizontal instruments remains the garden-gate described above. Vertical instruments use some kind of constant-force suspension, such as the LaCoste suspension. The LaCoste suspension uses a zero-length spring to provide a long period (high sensitivity). Some modern instruments use a \"triaxial\" or \"Galperin\" design, in which three identical motion sensors are set at the same angle to the vertical but 120 degrees apart on the horizontal. Vertical and horizontal motions can be computed from the outputs of the three sensors.  Seismometers unavoidably introduce some distortion into the signals they measure, but professionally designed systems have carefully characterized frequency transforms.  Modern sensitivities come in three broad ranges: geophones, 50 to 750 V/m; local geologic seismographs, about 1,500 V/m; and teleseismographs, used for world survey, about 20,000 V/m. Instruments come in three main varieties: short period, long period and broadband.  The short and long period measure velocity and are very sensitive, however they 'clip' the signal or go off-scale for ground motion that is strong enough to be felt by people.  A 24-bit analog-to-digital conversion channel is commonplace.  Practical devices are linear to roughly one part per million.  Delivered seismometers come with two styles of output: analog and digital. Analog seismographs require analog recording equipment, possibly including an analog-to-digital converter.  The output of a digital seismograph can be simply input to a computer.  It presents the data in a standard digital format (often \"SE2\" over Ethernet).  Teleseismometers  The modern broadband seismograph can record a very broad range of frequencies.  It consists of a small \"proof mass\", confined by electrical forces, driven by sophisticated electronics.  As the earth moves, the electronics attempt to hold the mass steady through a feedback circuit.  The amount of force necessary to achieve this is then recorded.  In most designs the electronics holds a mass motionless relative to the frame.  This device is called a \"force balance accelerometer\".  It measures  acceleration instead of velocity of ground movement.  Basically, the distance between the mass and some part of the frame is measured very precisely, by a linear variable differential transformer. Some instruments use a linear variable differential capacitor.  That measurement is then amplified by electronic amplifiers attached to parts of an electronic negative feedback loop.  One of the amplified currents from the negative feedback loop drives a coil very like a loudspeaker. The result is that the mass stays nearly motionless.  Most instruments measure directly the ground motion using the distance sensor. The voltage generated in a sense coil on the mass by the magnet directly measures the instantaneous velocity of the ground. The current to the drive coil provides a sensitive, accurate measurement of the force between the mass and frame, thus measuring directly the ground's acceleration (using f=ma where f=force, m=mass, a=acceleration).  One of the continuing problems with sensitive vertical seismographs is the buoyancy of their masses.  The uneven changes in pressure caused by wind blowing on an open window can easily change the density of the air in a room enough to cause a vertical seismograph to show spurious signals.  Therefore, most professional seismographs are sealed in rigid gas-tight enclosures.  For example, this is why a common Streckeisen model has a thick glass base that must be glued to its pier without bubbles in the glue.  It might seem logical to make the heavy magnet serve as a mass, but that subjects the seismograph to errors when the Earth's magnetic field moves.  This is also why seismograph's moving parts are constructed from a material that interacts minimally with magnetic fields.  A seismograph is also sensitive to changes in temperature so many instruments are constructed from low expansion materials such as nonmagnetic invar.  The hinges on a seismograph are usually patented, and by the time the patent has expired, the design has been improved.  The most successful public domain designs use thin foil hinges in a clamp.  Another issue is that the transfer function of a seismograph must be accurately characterized, so that its frequency response is known.  This is often the crucial difference between professional and amateur instruments.  Most instruments are characterized on a variable frequency shaking table.  Strong-motion seismometers Another type of seismometer is a digital strong-motion seismometer, or accelerograph. The data from such an instrument is essential to understand how an earthquake affects man-made structures, through earthquake engineering. The recordings of such instruments are crucial for the assessment of seismic hazard, through engineering seismology.  A strong-motion seismometer measures acceleration. This can be mathematically integrated later to give velocity and position. Strong-motion seismometers are not as sensitive to ground motions as teleseismic instruments but they stay on scale during the strongest seismic shaking.  Strong motion sensors are used for intensity meter applications.  Other forms  Accelerographs and geophones are often heavy cylindrical magnets with a spring-mounted coil inside.  As the case moves, the coil tends to stay stationary, so the magnetic field cuts the wires, inducing current in the output wires.  They receive frequencies from several hundred hertz down to 1\u00a0Hz.  Some have electronic damping, a low-budget way to get some of the performance of the closed-loop wide-band geologic seismographs.  Strain-beam accelerometers constructed as integrated circuits are too insensitive for geologic seismographs (2002), but are widely used in geophones.  Some other sensitive designs measure the current generated by the flow of a non-corrosive ionic fluid through an electret sponge or a conductive fluid through a magnetic field.  Interconnected seismometers Seismometers spaced in a seismic array can also be used to precisely locate, in three dimensions, the source of an earthquake, using the time it takes for seismic waves to propagate away from the hypocenter, the initiating point of fault rupture (See also Earthquake location).  Interconnected seismometers are also used, as part of the International Monitoring System to detect underground nuclear test explosions, as well as for Earthquake early warning systems. These seismometers are often used as part of a large scale governmental or scientific project, but some organizations such as the Quake-Catcher Network, can use residential size detectors built into computers to detect earthquakes as well.  In reflection seismology, an array of seismometers image sub-surface features.  The data are reduced to images using algorithms similar to tomography.  The data reduction methods resemble those of computer-aided tomographic medical imaging X-ray machines (CAT-scans), or imaging sonars.  A worldwide array of seismometers can actually image the interior of the Earth in wave-speed and transmissivity.  This type of system uses events such as earthquakes, impact events or nuclear explosions as wave sources.  The first efforts at this method used manual data reduction from paper seismograph charts.  Modern digital seismograph records are better adapted to direct computer use.  With inexpensive seismometer designs and internet access, amateurs and small institutions have even formed a \"public seismograph network\".  Seismographic systems used for petroleum or other mineral exploration historically used an explosive and a wireline of geophones unrolled behind a truck.  Now most short-range systems use \"thumpers\" that hit the ground, and some small commercial systems have such good digital signal processing that a few sledgehammer strikes provide enough signal for short-distance refractive surveys.  Exotic cross or two-dimensional arrays of geophones are sometimes used to perform three-dimensional reflective imaging of subsurface features.  Basic linear refractive geomapping software (once a black art) is available off-the-shelf, running on laptop computers, using strings as small as three geophones.  Some systems now come in an 18\" (0.5 m) plastic field case with a computer, display and printer in the cover.  Small seismic imaging systems are now sufficiently inexpensive to be used by civil engineers to survey foundation sites, locate bedrock, and find subsurface water.  Fiber optic cables as seismometers  A new technique for detecting earthquakes has been found, using fiber optic cables. In 2016 a team of metrologists running frequency metrology experiments in England observed noise with a wave-form resembling the seismic waves generated by earthquakes. This was found to match seismological observations of an  earthquake in Italy, ~1400\u00a0km away. Further experiments in England, Italy, and with a submarine fiber optic cable to Malta detected additional earthquakes, including one 4,100\u00a0km away, and an  earthquake 89\u00a0km away from the cable.  Seismic waves are detectable because they cause micrometer-scale changes in the length of the cable. As the length changes so does the time it takes a packet of light to traverse to the far end of the cable and back (using a second fiber). Using ultra-stable metrology-grade lasers, these extremely minute shifts of timing (on the order of femtoseconds) appear as phase-changes.  The point of the cable first disturbed by an earthquake's p-wave (essentially a sound wave in rock) can be determined by sending packets in both directions in the looped pair of optical fibers; the difference in the arrival times of the first pair of perturbed packets indicates the distance along the cable. This point is also the point closest to the earthquake's epicenter, which should be on a plane perpendicular to the cable. The difference between the p-wave/s-wave arrival times provides a distance (under ideal conditions), constraining the epicenter to a circle. A second detection on a non-parallel cable is needed to resolve the ambiguity of the resulting solution. Additional observations constrain the location of the earthquake's epicenter, and may resolve the depth.  This technique is expected to be a boon in observing earthquakes, especially the smaller ones, in vast portions of the global ocean where there are no seismometers, and at a cost much cheaper than ocean bottom seismometers.  Recording  Today, the most common recorder is a computer with an analog-to-digital converter, a disk drive and an internet connection; for amateurs, a PC with a sound card and associated software is adequate. Most systems record continuously, but some record only when a signal is detected, as shown by a short-term increase in the variation of the signal, compared to its long-term average (which can vary slowly because of changes in seismic noise), also known as a STA/LTA trigger.  Prior to the availability of digital processing of seismic data in the late 1970s, the records were done in a few different forms on different types of media. A \"Helicorder\" drum was a device used to record data into photographic paper or in the form of paper and ink. A \"Develocorder\" was a machine that record data from up to 20 channels into a 16-mm film. The recorded film can be viewed by a machine. The reading and measuring from these types of media can be done by hand. After the digital processing has been used, the archives of the seismic data were recorded in magnetic tapes. Due to the deterioration of older magnetic tape medias, large number of waveforms from the archives are not recoverable.

Early life Michel David-Weill was born into a Jewish family on November 23, 1932. His father, Pierre David-Weill (1900\u20131975), was the chairman of Lazard Fr\u00e8res; his mother was Berthe Haardt. His great-grandfather, , worked at Lazard Freres, a firm co-founded by his cousins, Alexandre, Elie, and Simon Lazard. In 1900, his grandfather, David David-Weill, was named a partner.  In 1927, his father Pierre David-Weill became a partner.  Separated from his father, who was in New York City during World War II, David-Weill remained behind with his mother in occupied France, and, during the last year of Nazi occupation, at age 11, he hid with his mother and younger sister in the French village of B\u00e9duer (Lot, southwestern France) where they were baptized and raised as Catholics (his father Pierre would later convert to Catholicism in 1965). After World War II was over, he went to live in New York City with his family.  David-Weill was educated at the Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais de New York and the Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris.  Career In 1956, he joined Lazard Freres, and, in 1961, became a partner Under the stewardship of the chairman of Andr\u00e9 Meyer, Felix Rohatyn, who handled acquisitions, and he himself, who was the bookkeeper, Lazard grew rapidly. In 1975, his father died and he inherited his equity stake in Lazard, becoming the largest stakeholder in both Lazard New York and Lazard Paris, while also holding stakes in Lazard London. In 1977, when Meyer became sick and Rohatyn turned down an offer to replace him, David-Weill was named chairman. He continued to work closely with managing director, Felix Rohatyn, who was also made senior partner at Lazard in 1961. Also, by the power provided in clause 4.1 of the Lazard partnership agreement, he alone had the power to set compensations and the right to fire any partners at his discretion.  Under David-Weill's direction, Lazard began to expand its business from traditional merger-and-acquisition advising to areas such as asset management and municipal bond. He also made numerous hires, including Steven Rattner. Lazard's profits also jumped from $5 million in the late 1970s to $500 million in the late 1990s. David-Weill also reunited the branches of Lazard by combining his stakes in New York and Paris and a buyout of Pearson for its stake in Lazard London for more than $600 million. After the retirement of Rohatyn, the firm's most prominent dealmaker, Lazard under David-Weill's leadership began to take a turn for the worse. Other dealmakers such as J. Ira Harris and Rattner also left the firm.  To strengthen Lazard, David-Weill hired Bruce Wasserstein as the CEO, who later decided to take Lazard public against the wishes of the family patriarch. David-Weill later stated that he regretted ever having hired Wasserstein. David-Weill is currently a director of Groupe Danone, one of the world's largest food-product companies.  Personal life In 1956, he married H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Marie Lehideux, daughter of Robert Lehideux. They have three children: B\u00e9atrice, married first to Bertrand de Villeneuve Bargemont and then to \u00c9douard Stern; C\u00e9cile, married to Emmanuel Renom de La Baume; and Nathalie, married to Olivier Merveilleux du Vignaux. (See the entry in French Wikipedia, Famille David-Weill.)  He was honored by the government of France, made a Commander of the Legion of Honor and a Commander of Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, the nation's highest cultural honor.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Stealing First Base\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "\"Stealing First Base\" is the sixteenth episode of the twenty-first season of the American animated television series The Simpsons. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 21, 2010. In this episode, Bart falls in love with a girl named Nikki from a second fourth-grade class, but when he kisses her, Nikki begins treating Bart like dirt. Meanwhile, First Lady Michelle Obama teaches Lisa that there is no shame in being an overachiever, and Nelson Muntz teaches a blind boy how to be a schoolyard bully.  The episode was written by John Frink and directed by Steven Dean Moore.  The episode was also watched by 5.69 million households and received a 2.8/8 in the 18-49 Nielsen Rating.  The episode received mixed reviews from critics. The episode guest stars Sarah Silverman as Nikki and Angela Bassett as Michelle Obama.  Plot Bart's fourth-grade class is merged with another fourth-grade class when teacher Mrs. Krabappel is absent. In the crowded classroom, Bart is forced to sit by a new student named Nikki. At first, they dislike each other, until Nikki admires Bart's artistic skills. Bart seeks romance advice from Homer, who passes him off to Grandpa Abe. After Grandpa advises Bart to kiss Nikki, however, when Bart does so after the two skateboard together, she recoils in disgust. Nikki's attorney's parents threaten to sue the school unless it is declared an \"affection-free environment\". Superintendent Chalmers causes a play in which Willie plays Nikki and Skinner plays Bart who was strangled by Homer after calling him a \u201cFatso\u201d, meaning they are forced to kiss. Bart is confused at the outcome of this seemingly innocent action, and his confusion is later amplified when Nikki hides in his locker and kisses him again.  Meanwhile, Lisa becomes popular when she receives an F on a test, but becomes unpopular again when it is revealed that her test was mistakenly given to Ralph, as both tests were mixed up as the F grade was supposed to be given to Ralph who had written Lisa's name on his test. Angry about being ostracized for being an overachiever once again, Lisa blogs about it, and her post is noted by a mysterious blogger known as Flotus 1 who turns out to be First Lady Michelle Obama. Obama drops by Springfield Elementary to give a speech about the importance of academics and recommends that the students should be nice to Lisa and other overachievers like her friends, Martin Prince and Allison Taylor.  Bart and Nikki have been watching this speech from the roof, and Bart confesses to Nikki he does not understand her ever-changing moods. They argue and Bart stumbles, falling off the roof. Nikki says \"I love you,\" but seeing that Bart is breathing treats him badly again. Bart stops breathing again, but the school's \"no-touch\" policy prevents anyone from performing CPR. Nikki defies the policy and revives Bart via mouth-to-mouth, thus setting off a montage of kiss scenes from various movies, some of which (such as Alien 3) never even had kiss scenes in them. When Bart awakes, Nikki's mood changes yet again and Bart remains in a state of complete confusion over female behavior. He tells her he does not care what happens between her and him, but then changes his mind and yells out \"I love you!\" after she kisses him once again.  Throughout the episode, Nelson Muntz has befriended a blind boy and teaches him how to laugh at the misfortunes of others. In the end, the blind boy tricks Nelson into believing that a punch he sustained after insulting Nelson restored his sight. When he reveals to Nelson that this was a prank and laughs at Nelson's signature \"haw haw\", Nelson is as impressed as he is touched by the achievement.  Production The episode is written by John Frink and directed by Steven Dean Moore, his second director credit for the season after \"O Brother, Where Bart Thou?\". The episode features guest star Sarah Silverman as Nikki (Bart's crush) and Angela Bassett as Michelle Obama.  In September 2016, executive producer James L. Brooks told  Variety that the crew had been \"aggressive\" in trying to get Obama to voice herself, and received a rejection note saying \"good try\".  Cultural references In the classroom, Nikki shows Bart a book about vampires which looks like the Twilight series book New Moon, which reads Red Moon. In the scene where Nikki performs CPR on Bart, recreations of kissing scenes from a variety of films and television shows are shown. These scenes are (in order); From Here to Eternity (1953), Gone with the Wind (1939), The Quiet Man (1952), Lady and the Tramp (1955), Planet of the Apes (1968), On Golden Pond (1981), Ghost (1990), Spider-Man (2002), Star Trek (2009), Beauty and the Beast (1987\u20131990), The Public Enemy (1931), WALL-E (2008), Alien 3 (1992), The Godfather: Part II (1974), and an All in the Family (1971\u20131979) episode in which Sammy Davis Jr. guest starred. The sequence, and the accompanying musical score, are a nod to Cinema Paradiso (1988), directed by Giuseppe Tornatore, with score by Ennio and Andrea Morricone. The Itchy & Scratchy cartoon is a parody of the 1982 film Koyaanisqatsi: Life Out of Balance, here titled Koyaanis-Scratchy: Death Out of Balance.  Reception In its original American broadcast, \"Stealing First Base\" was watched by 5.69 million households getting a 2.8/8 in the 18-49 Nielsen Rating. The episode came in second in its time slot and was the second most-watched show on Fox that night, after a new episode of Family Guy.  Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club criticized the episode, giving it a C+, calling the harassment storyline \"pointless and stupid\" although praised the Nelson subplot.  However, Jason Hughes of HuffPostTV praised the storyline, writing \"I applaud the series for facing such an issue with such intensity, and handling it with humor and compassion\".  Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode an 8 out of 10, saying that \"Nikki turned out to be a fun and memorable character.\" Overall he stated that \"Although \u2018Stealing First Base\u2019 fed us some old ideas, it did so with a lot of great bits...and some very strong guest voices.\"  Soundtrack  The scene where Bart and Nikki were performing a skateboard parkour contains the song \"Chase\" by Giorgio Moroder on the original FOX broadcast. When the episode is shown in syndication, \"Chase\" is replaced by a musically similar composition.  The classical music that is heard during the montage of movie kiss scenes is currently believed to be orchestrated specifically for the show, rather than being a score that was written independently and used during the program. Original music is from Cinema Paradiso - \"Love Theme\", composed by Andrea Morricone.

The rules of baseball require that a runner must be in possession of their base at the time of the pitch. However, a runner may attempt to steal a base at any time, and the success of this act depends on the runner's speed and the pitcher's and catcher's ability to respond quickly and accurately. If the runner is successful in stealing a base, they are generally not required to return to the base they just stole (unless the defensive team makes a throw to that base, in which case the runner must be in possession of that base). Stealing first base is generally not attempted, as stealing second base is much more practical and common. First base is only stolen when there is a large lead, when the runner needs to get to second base to be in a better position to steal third base or score a run, or when the defensive team is performing a double switch, in which the player who was at first base is now playing elsewhere on the field. A stolen base is one of the few ways a team can generate an offensive threat without the batter hitting the ball. The other ways are a bunt or a walk. The greatest single-season stolen base total since 1901 was held by Rickey Henderson, who stole 130 bases in 1982. The most stolen bases by a team in a single season was held by the 1930 Philadelphia Phillies, who stole 314 bases. The term \"stealing first base\" can also refer to other situations in which a runner reaches first base without the assistance of the batter, such as when the defensive team commits an error, when the ball is hit to the wall for a ground-rule double, or when the runner is awarded first base due to interference or obstruction by the defensive team.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 25986662}

There are currently nine Physical Sciences-Oncology Centers in the United States. The Physical Sciences-Oncology Centers program was initiated in 2009 by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) with the goal of bringing innovative technologies and unique perspectives of physical scientists to the fight against cancer while training the next generation of physical science researchers. Each PS-OC is a partnership between a physical sciences institution and an oncology institution. The physical sciences institution may be a university, college, or research institution with faculty and facilities dedicated to the study of physics, chemistry, or engineering. The oncology institution may be a university, college, hospital, or research institution with expertise and facilities in basic, translational, and/or clinical cancer research. The Physical Sciences-Oncology Centers program is built on the premise that the physical sciences have unique and powerful methods for attacking problems that are difficult, yet critical, to the oncologist. The physical sciences include many subdisciplines that make use of state-of-the-art experimental, computational, and theoretical methods to achieve a deep understanding of physical systems. The methods and perspectives of the physical sciences can be applied to many important problems in oncology that are not easily addressed by traditional means. The Physical Sciences-Oncology Centers program supports research projects that address important problems in cancer research. Each project consists of a team of investigators from the physical sciences and oncology institutions in the PS-OC. The teams are led by a principal investigator from each institution. The projects are intended to be highly interactive and multidisciplinary, with investigators contributing their unique expertise and perspective to the project. Projects are expected to have a strong potential for technological innovation with potential impact on cancer biology or clinical oncology. In addition to supporting research, the Physical Sciences-Oncology Centers program supports the training of predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees in the physical sciences and oncologic sciences. The goal of the training program is to prepare the next generation of physical and oncologic scientists to work together to solve the most challenging problems in cancer research.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 39800124}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Doctor Who (series 5)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The fifth series of the British science-fiction television programme Doctor Who was originally broadcast on BBC One in 2010. The series began on 3 April 2010 with \"The Eleventh Hour\", and ended with \"The Big Bang\" on 26 June 2010. It was produced by head writer and executive producer Steven Moffat, who took over when Russell T Davies ended his involvement in the show after \"The End of Time\". The series has 13 episodes, six of which were written by Moffat. Piers Wenger and Beth Willis were co-executive producers, and Tracie Simpson and Peter Bennett were producers. Although it is the fifth series since the show's revival in 2005 (and the thirty-first since it began in 1963), the series' production code numbers were reset.  It was the first series to feature Matt Smith as the eleventh incarnation of the Doctor, an alien Time Lord who travels through time and space in his TARDIS (a spacecraft whose exterior resembles a British police box). Karen Gillan is introduced as the Doctor's new companion, Amy Pond. Her fianc\u00e9, Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill), appears in seven episodes, travels with the Doctor and Amy, and is a regular character in the next series. Alex Kingston returns as River Song, a mysterious woman from the Doctor's future who summons him twice in this series. The main story arc, covering several episodes, concerns a pattern of cracks in the universe which are sometimes unnoticed by the characters. It is discovered that the cracks can erase things from existence; this happens to Rory, and Amy forgets him. It is revealed in the series finale it that the cracks were caused by the TARDIS exploding, and the Doctor is forced to reboot the universe to its state before the cracks appeared.  In addition to the six episodes written by Moffat, Mark Gatiss, Toby Whithouse, Simon Nye, Richard Curtis, and Gareth Roberts wrote one episode each; Chris Chibnall wrote a two-episode story. The series was meant to be fantastical to stand out from other science-fiction and fantasy shows, and the production team strove for a fairy-tale quality because Moffat believed that media aimed at children were some of the most popular among adults. The episodes were directed by directors who were new to Doctor Who. Filming began in late July 2009, lasting about nine months. The series was filmed primarily in Wales, except for \"The Vampires of Venice\" and \"Vincent and the Doctor\" (which had scenes filmed in Trogir, Croatia). Design changes from the previous series included a new logo, title sequence, variant of the Doctor's sonic screwdriver, interior and exterior of the TARDIS, and a change in the theme music.  The series premiere was watched by 10.085 million viewers (the most-watched premiere since \"Rose\" of the first series), and set records on BBC America in the United States and the BBC's online iPlayer. Although overnight ratings declined compared to other series, one writer calculated that viewership had not changed significantly when time-shifted ratings were taken into account. The series received positive reviews, with praise for Moffat's story arc and the performances of Smith, Gillan, and Darvill. However, reviewers noted Amy's lack of character development and the series' diminished emotional appeal. It received a number of awards and nominations; \"Vincent and the Doctor\" and the two-part finale were nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation (Short Form), with the award going to the finale. Smith was the first actor playing the Doctor to be nominated for a BAFTA award. The series was accompanied by a soundtrack and tie-in books and video games; four of the latter were released on the BBC website and advertised as additional episodes of the series.  Episodes  Supplemental scenes Two scenes were filmed for the Complete Fifth Series box set, revealing what happened between pairs of regular episodes. The first scene is set between \"The Eleventh Hour\" and \"The Beast Below\", and the second is set between \"Flesh and Stone\" and \"The Vampires of Venice\".  Casting  The series introduced the Eleventh Doctor, played by Matt Smith. This followed the departure of David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor, who left the show to help ease the transition from Davies to Moffat. Smith's agent called him, suggesting that he audition for the role. Moffat wanted to cast a middle-aged actor, \"young enough to run but old enough to look wise\". When Smith was the third person to audition the production team knew \"[they] had their man\", although he was 26 years old. The producers were cautious about casting Smith because they felt that a 26-year-old actor could not play the Doctor; although BBC Head of Drama and executive producer Piers Wenger agreed, he said that Smith was capable enough to play the part. According to Moffat, Smith did not appear youthful. Smith's casting was announced during an episode of the Doctor Who companion show Doctor Who Confidential, when he described the role as \"a wonderful privilege and challenge that I hope I will thrive on\".  Karen Gillan was cast as Amy Pond, the Doctor's companion. Casting director Andy Pryor suggested Gillan to Moffat after her performance in the fourth series episode \"The Fires of Pompeii\" (when she played a soothsayer), but Moffat originally considered her \"short and dumpy\". He later called her \"exactly right for the role\", although she played the character differently from the way it was originally written. Gillan auditioned for the role in her (natural) Scottish accent and an English one, and after she was cast it was decided that Amy would be Scottish. Gillan felt that the Scottish accent better suited her character. A young version of Amy (Amelia) was played by Gillan's 10-year-old cousin, Caitlin Blackwood, in the first and last episodes. The actresses had not met until the show but, although Blackwood had to audition, Gillan recommended her for the role. Blackwood and Gillan appeared together in \"The Big Bang\", which Gillan initially found \"weird\" (although the actresses quickly got used to it).  Alex Kingston, who played River Song in the Series 4 episodes, \"Silence in the Library\" and \"Forest of the Dead\", reprised her role in the two-part stories \"The Time of Angels\" and \"Flesh and Stone\" and \"The Pandorica Opens\" and \"The Big Bang\". Although Kingston did not expect to return, Moffat always intended for River to return to the series. Arthur Darvill appeared in seven episodes as Rory Williams, Amy's fianc\u00e9, and was a companion in six of the episodes. Darvill had worked with Smith on a play, Swimming with Sharks. He received two scenes from the first episode and one from the sixth for his audition, but (except for Rory being Amy's boyfriend) he was not informed of the character's details. Moffat noted \"just how funny\" Darvill was during his audition. The actor felt \"privileged\" to be part of the show, and was pleased with Rory's storyline. Guest stars in the series included Olivia Colman, James Corden, Annette Crosbie, Tony Curran, Iain Glen, Daisy Haggard, Terrence Hardiman, Toby Jones, Helen McCrory, Neve McIntosh, Ian McNeice, Stephen Moore, Lucian Msamati, Bill Nighy, Sophie Okonedo, Bill Paterson, Alex Price, Robert Pugh, Nia Roberts, Meera Syal and Nina Wadia.  Production  Development Doctor Who was renewed for a fifth series in September 2007. Russell T Davies was succeeded by Steven Moffat as executive producer and head writer and Julie Gardner was replaced as executive producer by Piers Wenger, who had replaced Gardner as BBC Wales head of drama. Beth Willis was an executive producer, and the series was produced by Tracie Simpson and Peter Bennett. Murray Gold remained as composer.  The 2005 Doctor Who revival was marketed as series 1, although it had been broadcast on BBC television for 26 years (from 1963 to 1989). When the series was confirmed by the BBC in September 2007, it was called \"series 5\" and followed 2008's series 4. In August 2009, Doctor Who Magazine reported that the series would be produced and marketed as \"Series One\". The January 2010 issue contained an interview with Moffat in which he called Series One \"exciting\", Series Thirty-One \"awe-inspiring\", and Series Five \"boring and a lie\". He jokingly referred to the season as \"series Fnarg\", which became a running joke in later issues of the magazine. The March issue, which called it Series Thirty-One, listed production code numbers from 1.1 to 1.13. However, BBC Programme listings, the BBC iPlayer and DVDs refer to it as \"Series 5\".  Writing Despite changes to the show, Moffat wanted to reassure the audience that \"nothing has really been lost\"; it was the same show, and the Doctor was the same character. The story arc of cracks in the universe was inspired by a crack in the wall of Moffat's son's bedroom. Moffat wanted to ensure that the show appealed to young children; if they could not follow the plot, there would be \"big pictures\" to entertain them. He believed that although Doctor Who is fundamentally a children's show, it has a universal appeal comparable to Star Wars and Toy Story. Moffat considered a children's story the \"most popular form of entertainment\". About the series, he said that they \"pushed the fairytale side of it\"; Doctor Who \"now has to be the most fantastical of the fantasy shows\" to be more vibrant and \"bonkers\" than any other fantasy show.  In a 2013 interview, Moffat said that he had worked out a rough idea for how his first series as showrunner would work if David Tennant had decided to remain as the Tenth Doctor. Its premise would have been similar to the beginning of \"The Eleventh Hour\" as broadcast:   Moffat wrote six episodes for the series; the rest were written by others, since he believed that Doctor Who benefited from different voices. According to Moffat, he primarily supplied the other episode concepts and had a \"pretty good idea\" of what would happen in each episode. He knew the guest writers \"to some degree\", and called his meetings with them \"quite joyous\". Matthew Graham, co-creator of Life on Mars and writer of the second series episode \"Fear Her\", did not write his planned episode because he did not believe he would have enough time. Moffat later contacted him and asked him to write a two-part episode for the next series (\"The Rebel Flesh\" and \"The Almost People\").  In the first episode, Moffat intended to introduce the Eleventh Doctor and establish his new identity; the second was intended to demonstrate the Doctor's need for a companion and Amy's importance to him. For the third episode, he asked Mark Gatiss to write an episode about \"Churchill versus the Daleks\". Moffat wanted to incorporate the popular Daleks into the new series, and considered redesigning them. Gatiss, Moffat and the production team worked together to create large, more-colourful Daleks, similar to those in the 1960s films.  For the fourth and fifth episodes, Moffat planned a two-part sequel to his 2007 \"Blink\" with the Weeping Angels. The episodes, \"The Time of Angels\" and \"Flesh and Stone\", were intended to be more action-oriented than \"Blink\" and demonstrate that the Angels had a plan other than scavenging. He decided to flesh out the Angels as villains and show more of what they could do. \"Flesh and Stone\" ends with Amy attempting to seduce the Doctor, which Moffat believed was consistent with her character development.  Toby Whithouse originally planned to write a different episode, but Moffat and Wenger considered it too similar to other episodes in the series. Whithouse wrote \"The Vampires of Venice\" instead, and his original episode was moved back to the next series. He was asked to write \"a big bold romantic episode\" which would be a \"good jumping off point\" for new viewers of Doctor Who. Moffat thought that in the middle of the series, a viewer could \"start watching it again\" and it should be \"something romantic and funny\". For the next episode, Moffat asked comedy writer Simon Nye to write a story which challenged the relationship between Amy and the Doctor. The episode, \"Amy's Choice\", was intended to have the character choose between excitement with the Doctor or life with Rory. The scene in which Rory dies in the false reality was intended to reveal Amy's feelings for him. Nye wanted to stress that Amy really loved Rory, and he was not \"just a cypher boyfriend or fianc\u00e9\".  Moffat contacted Chris Chibnall to write a two-part episode involving the Silurians, villains who had not appeared on the show for over 25 years. Since the Silurians were not as well known as other monsters, he instructed Chibnall to reintroduce them. These Silurians were intended to be a different branch than the original ones; their design was different, with facial prosthetics and no third eye. Richard Curtis, who had worked with Moffat on the 1999 Comic Relief special Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death, was contacted by Moffat to return the favour and write an episode (\"Vincent and the Doctor\"). Curtis had an idea for an episode about van Gogh for \"a long while\", and was intrigued that van Gogh never knew he was famous. Gillan noted that there was a different approach and style to the episode, and it was more character-driven.  Although Neil Gaiman had written \"The Doctor's Wife\", it was moved to the next series due to budgetary constraints and replaced with \"The Lodger\". \"The Lodger\" was adapted from a comic strip of the same name by Gareth Roberts for Doctor Who Magazine, although he said that most of it was begun \"from scratch\". The story was inspired by the desire to see the Doctor in normal, every-day human circumstances and Roberts' enjoyment of stories set on Earth, rather than in space. Roberts was interested in doing a television version of the story, but had not mentioned it; Moffat enjoyed the comic story, and asked to adapt it into an episode when he became showrunner. In a 2021 interview, Robert Shearman revealed he had been involved in development for Series 5, but later departed. Moffat extended an open invitation to return, but Shearman declined, citing changes in his career and the higher profile of screenwriters attracted to the show.  Aspects of the finale occurred to Moffat as he planned the series' story arc, although he left room to improvise as the story developed. \"The Big Bang\" ends with Amy and Rory's wedding; Moffat said that he had intended for them to get married \"from the off\". The finale left questions (which would be answered in the next series) about River Song's identity and \"the Silence\", which apparently caused the TARDIS to explode.  Costumes Although the Eleventh Doctor still wears his previous incarnation's costume in the first episode, costume designer Ray Holman said that the costume was broken-down and distressed. During the first episode, he would find his own identity and pick out his unique costume. Smith tried on a variety of things to find a look he would feel comfortable and confident in and which would identify his Doctor. He brought in braces and a tweed jacket; Holman thought the tweed jacket was \"a bit old for him\", but it indicated that he was a \"professor and student at the same time\" and gave him \"that quality that the Doctor's still learning, but also has some authority\". Smith suggested a bow tie; Holman and others did not approve, but when he put it on they decided that they had his costume. According to the actor, he was influenced by the Second Doctor's costume in The Tomb of the Cybermen. Other inspirations were the \"element of a professor\" and \"big, dusty boots like Indiana Jones\". The men's clothing store Topman reported that their bow-tie sales increased by 94 percent in April 2010, when the series began airing.  Gillan had substantial input into Amy's costume, hairstyle and make-up. Holman said that Amy's identity was unclear in the first episode, but she later wore her own clothes. According to the actress, Amy had the inner confidence to wear clothes which showed \"a bit of skin from time to time\". Although she tried on a number of costumes, when it came to short skirts she \"just thought it was right\" and indicated that Amy was \"comfortable and confident about her look\". Gillan believed that the skirts reflected what young women typically wear at her age. Executive producer Piers Wenger noted that Amy's 1970s flying jacket (which she wore \"quite a lot\") reflected Gillan as a \"born adventurer\", and Amy developed a love of travel and adventure.  Design changes  The series introduced a new logo, which was announced in October 2009. According to the BBC, it was the eleventh version of the show's logo. According to Moffat, the \"DW\" insignia in the shape of the TARDIS was \"something really new\". The logo was incorporated in a new title sequence, which was not revealed to an audience outside the BBC until the first transmission of \"The Eleventh Hour\"; previous press screenings and previews had used a variant of the previous sequence. Moffat wanted a new version of the theme music, and composer Murray Gold wanted it to \"sound a bit reckless\". The new version, composed by Gold, incorporated an electronic-trumpet melody and a faster tempo. Some fans disliked the new theme, and the BBC had received 70 complaints by 18 April 2010. A Doctor Who spokesman responded, \"The arranger has made alterations to the music four times since 2005, so change is nothing new. It is important for the regeneration of the show to keep revisiting the score while always retaining the haunting and ground-breaking essence of the original\".  A new TARDIS prop was used, with the St John Ambulance logo which had been used in the early days of the show and the mid-1960s Peter Cushing films (of which Moffat was a fan). Moffat said that it was something he \"really wanted to do\", was for \"no other reason than that [he] thought it was prettier\", and he wanted the St John Ambulance sticker on the front. It is a brighter shade of blue, like Cushing's TARDIS.  A new set of the TARDIS interior was designed, which Moffat estimated was three times larger than the previous set. Although he did not decide to create the new interior specifically for the new Doctor, the set designer was briefed to create a design which would suit Smith's Doctor. Moffat liked the old set, but thought it was time for a new one to \"surprise people\" and believed that the spirit of a new era was to change everything. Piers Wenger said that it took \"quite a long time to get the design right\", and they were careful not to make it too futuristic-looking since \"futuristic\" meant nothing to the Doctor. The set was designed by Edward Thomas. The previous TARDIS interior was shown at the beginning of \"The Eleventh Hour\"; the Time Rotor on the console had to be rebuilt, due to the explosive special effects used in \"The End of Time\". The sonic screwdriver is destroyed in \"The Eleventh Hour\" and a new version, with a green light and metal claws, was created. Smith liked to keep the prop with him, \"twirling it around and flicking it\", and broke four of them. The noise made by the screwdriver was added in post-production with a synthesizer. Moffat described the changes as starting with a \"clean slate\", which made sense after the previous cast and crew had left.  Filming All the series' directors were new to Doctor Who; Moffat said that he wanted to \"shake things up\", and it was \"never too early to get rid of the safety net.\" Adam Smith directed the first, fourth and fifth episodes, and Andrew Gunn, Ashley Way, Jonny Campbell, Toby Haynes and Catherine Morshead directed two episodes apiece.  Rehearsing episodes four and five (the first episodes produced), director Adam Smith suggested that Smith and Gillan \"have an adventure\" in which they could experience something exciting, laugh and scream; he took them on a \"real white knuckle ride\" on a boat in Cardiff Bay. Filming began on 20 July 2009 on the Southerndown beach in the Vale of Glamorgan for \"The Time of Angels\" and \"Flesh and Stone\". Moffat wrote that in a typical television production the first day of filming \"will probably be something fairly inconsequential and involve a minor character getting shot, or a close up of a hand or something\", rather than the \"iconic\" scene with the Doctor, Amy, River Song and the TARDIS. Forest scenes in \"Flesh and Stone\" were filmed at Puzzlewood in the Forest of Dean over nine nights in July 2009.  Episodes two and three made up the second production block. Scenes for \"The Beast Below\" were filmed in an orangery at Margam Country Park in Port Talbot during a night shoot on 22 September 2009. Half a scene for \"The Pandorica Opens\", with Liz 10 (Sophie Okonedo) from \"The Beast Below\", was also filmed there. Scenes for Amy and Rory's town of Leadworth in the first episode, \"The Eleventh Hour\", were filmed in the village of Llandaff in Cardiff over a number of days in the autumn of 2009: 29 September, 5\u20137 October, and 20 November.  The fourth production block, consisting of \"The Hungry Earth\" and \"Cold Blood\", was filmed in October and November 2009; location filming was done in Llanwynno, Wales. Scenes for \"Cold Blood\" were also filmed at the Plantasia botanical garden in Swansea on 13 November 2009, and in Cardiff's Temple of Peace and other locations and unusual sets for the Silurian city. \"The Vampires of Venice\" and \"Vincent and the Doctor\" were filmed primarily in Trogir, Croatia, which stood in for Venice and Paris respectively. Although a small crew went to Venice for wide shots of coastal buildings, the episode was not filmed there because it would take too long to cover up the modern shops in the present-day city. Scenes for \"The Vampires of Venice\" were also filmed at Atlantic College, Caerphilly Castle, Castell Coch, Trogir's town hall, and Llancaich Fawr Manor.  The grounds of the Margam Country Park estate were used for the placement of \"Foamhenge\", a lightweight replica of Stonehenge for \"The Pandorica Opens\". Several other scenes for \"The Pandorica Opens\" and \"The Big Bang\" were also filmed there during the first few days of February 2010. The Pandorica chamber was filmed in Upper Boat Studios, on the largest set ever built there. Additional scenes for \"The Big Bang\" were filmed in Brangwyn Hall and Miskin Manor. \"Amy's Choice\" was partially filmed in Skenfrith, Wales, as Upper Leadworth.  Filming of the series lasted about nine months. Production blocks were arranged as follows:  Release  Promotion  The first trailer of the series was shown on television and released online shortly after the broadcast of the second part of \"The End of Time\" on 1 January 2010. On 17 February, a new promotional image was released. A second trailer was released on 20 February, and a 3D version was shown in cinemas with Alice in Wonderland. Moffat confirmed the series' 3 April start date on the 19 March BBC Breakfast. That day, a trailer shown at the press screening of episode one was released online. BBC America, who would air the series in the United States, released an extended trailer on 21 March. Promotional touring for the series began on 29 March and ended the two days later, with Smith and Gillan presenting the first episode in Belfast, Inverness, Sunderland, Salford and Northampton. The first episode was screened in New York's Paley Center for Media and the Village East Movie Theatre on 14\u00a0April.  Domestic broadcast The fifth series of Doctor Who debuted on BBC One on 3 April 2010 with \"The Eleventh Hour\", an extended 65-minute episode. It concluded with \"The Big Bang\" on 26 June. The sixth episode (\"The Vampires of Venice\") was broadcast at 6:00\u00a0p.m. BST, the earliest start time for an episode of Doctor Who since its 2005 return.  International broadcast The series was shown in Australia on the ABC's iview service, launching at midnight on 16 April 2010 before airing on ABC1 two days later. It began airing in the United States on 17 April 2010 on BBC America and in Canada that day on Space. This was the first initial airing of a full series of Doctor Who on BBC America; the first four series premiered on the Sci-Fi Channel, rerunning on BBC America. The gap between the UK and US airings lessened considerably. In New Zealand, the series began airing on Prime on 2 May 2010.  Home media   On 7 June 2010, the first volume of Series 5 was released on DVD and Blu-ray in Region 2 with \"The Eleventh Hour\", \"The Beast Below\" and \"Victory of the Daleks\". The second volume was released on 5 July on DVD and Blu-ray, with \"The Time of Angels\", \"Flesh and Stone\" and \"The Vampires of Venice\". \"Amy's Choice\", \"The Hungry Earth\", and \"Cold Blood\" followed in the third volume, which was released in DVD and Blu-ray on 2 August 2010. The fourth and final volume, with \"Vincent and the Doctor\", \"The Lodger\", \"The Pandorica Opens\" and \"The Big Bang\", was released on DVD and Blu-ray on 6 September.  A collection of the series' episodes was released on DVD and Blu-ray in Region 2 on 8 November 2010 and in Region 1 the following day. In Region 4, the box set was released on 2 December 2010. It contained the two \"Meanwhile, in the TARDIS\" additional scenes, profiles of enemies in \"The Monster Files\", abridged versions of Doctor Who Confidential, out-takes, in-vision commentaries, video diaries, and trailers and promos for the series. The commentaries were a departure from previous releases, with six instead of a full thirteen.  Books  Novelisations  Novels  In the BBC Books Doctor Who New Series Adventures line (a series of spin-off novels which began in 2005 with the Ninth Doctor and the revival of the television series), six novels were published corresponding to the series. On 22 April 2010, the first three (Apollo 23 by Justin Richards, Night of the Humans by David Llewellyn, and The Forgotten Army by Brian Minchin) were published with the Eleventh Doctor and Amy. On 8 July 2010, three more novels were published: Nuclear Time by Oli Smith, The Glamour Chase by Gary Russell and The King's Dragon by Una McCormack, with the Doctor, Amy and Rory.  Science-fiction writer Michael Moorcock, who had watched Doctor Who since the beginning, also wrote a novel. The 345-page The Coming of the Terraphiles was published on 14 October 2010. On 16 September 2010, BBC Books published their first Doctor Who graphic novel: The Only Good Dalek, with the Doctor and Amy. BBC Books also published The Brilliant Book of Doctor Who 2011, a guide to the series with behind-the-scenes content, in the UK on 30 September 2010.  Video games  In March 2010, it was reported that Nintendo had signed a \u00a310 million contract for Doctor Who games for Wii and DS. The games were marketed to Nintendo because the brand was known as family-oriented and the Wii, in particular, was something that families played together. The BBC was certain to monitor the games and make sure they did not contain excessive violence. Doctor Who: Evacuation Earth was released for the DS and featured the Daleks, and Doctor Who: Return to Earth featured the Cybermen and was released for the Wii. Both games featured the Eleventh Doctor and Amy Pond, voiced by Smith and Gillan. Evacuation Earth was released on 12 November 2010, with Return to Earth following on 19 November. Wii remotes and DS styluses modeled after the sonic screwdriver were released to accompany the games.  In April 2010 the BBC announced The Adventure Games, four interactive episodes available free-to-download on the BBC Doctor Who website with the Doctor and Amy voiced by Smith and Gillan. Piers Wenger referred to them as four extra episodes in the series, with all content part of the Doctor Who universe. The games, developed by Charles Cecil and Sheffield-based game company Sumo, were written by Phil Ford and James Moran and overseen by Moffat and the show's producers. Cecil was contacted by BBC Wales interactive editor Iain Tweedale, who asked him about developing a Doctor Who game. Smith and Gillan's movements were captured by rotoscoping.  Since the Doctor is a pacifist and does not use the guns commonly found in video games, The Adventure Games utilised a more strategy- and puzzle-based gameplay; much of the first game was based on stealth, exploration, and puzzle-solving. The Doctor was equipped with his sonic screwdriver but, since it was often used as a skeleton key in the show, the game employs puzzle-solving to advance instead of simply using the screwdriver.  The first installment, City of the Daleks, was originally scheduled for release on 5 June 2010, but was made available two days earlier. The BBC explained the early release as a testing procedure, and final tweaks were expected to be made before its official release. In its first twelve days of availability the game was downloaded over 500,000 times, and traffic on the website had increased. The second game, Blood of the Cybermen, was released on 26 June after the series finale aired. It was followed by the third game (TARDIS) on 27 August, and Shadows of the Vashta Nerada on 22 December.  A mobile game app was also developed by Tag Games for BBC Worldwide. Entitled \"Doctor Who: The Mazes of Time\", it allowed play as the Doctor and Amy and involved time travel, defeating enemies, and solving problems. The game had over 100 puzzles, seven locations to travel to, music from the show, and the Daleks, Cybermen and Silurians as enemies. The app was released for Apple IOS devices on 16 December 2010, and for Android on 17 August 2011.  Reception  Ratings  Final consolidated viewing figures showed that the premiere, \"The Eleventh Hour\", was seen by 10.085 million viewers\u2014the most-watched premiere since \"Rose\", and the eighth-highest figure for an episode of Doctor Who since its 2005 revival. In the US, the first episode set a record for BBC America with an average of 1.2 million viewers and 0.9 million in the adult 25\u201354 demographic. Within a week of its broadcast, \"The Eleventh Hour\" received 1.27 million hits on BBC's online iPlayer service\u2014a record for the most requests in a week. It was the most-requested episode of 2010 (with 2.2 million views), and Doctor Who was also the most-watched programme of the year on the service.  \"The Hungry Earth\" received the lowest overnight ratings since the series' 2005 return, with 4.4 million viewers; in final consolidated ratings, \"The Lodger\" was the series' low point. Its episodes received an Appreciation Index, a measure of how much the audience enjoyed the programme. The BBC considers a score 85 or above \"excellent\"; \"Victory of the Daleks\" and \"Amy's Choice\" were the only episodes to score less (84). \"The Time of Angels\" and \"The Lodger\" scored an 87, and \"The Pandorica Opens\" scored an 88. The finale (\"The Big Bang\") scored an 89, a series high and the highest of the BBC's four main channels on the day it was broadcast.  Based on overnight ratings, the series averaged six million viewers (a drop of 1.2 million from the previous series). BBC managers said that overall viewing numbers had not declined, since more people watched it online or recorded it. Stephen Bray of Den of Geek decided to \"put things straight\"; with final ratings taken into account of the first eleven episodes of the series (the last two ratings not released when the article was published), the series averaged 7.8 million viewers. This exceeded the average of the second series (7.5 million), the third series (7.7 million), and the first eleven episodes of the fourth series (7.7 million).  Critical reception  Series 5 received highly positive reviews from critics following its broadcast. The series garnered a 100% approval from 13 critics\u2014an average rating of 8.96/10 on the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, which said, \"Doctor Who morphs once again into an enchanting odyssey in its fifth season, spearheaded by Matt Smith's endlessly endearing incarnation of the Time Lord.\" Matt Wales of IGN gave the series a \"great\" rating of 8.5 out of 10, saying that it \"mightn't have been perfect\" but rebooted the show \"with a burst of creative energy\" and \"got bold, exciting, witty, smart, home-grown event television back on the small screen\". He praised Smith for \"[dazzling] with a performance that painted the Doctor as thoroughly alien\" and the Doctor's \"effortless\" character development, but was critical of the Amy Pond character. Although he considered her \"thoroughly watchable\" (particularly her chemistry with Smith), he criticised the character as \"frequently painted in largely two-dimensional strokes that made for a brash, sometimes irritating turn\" and the series as a whole for lacking \"heart to ground the elaborate sci-fi trimmings\". Wales praised Moffat's \"beautifully conceived\" story arc and the narrative's complexities.  Zap2it's Sam McPherson gave the series an \"A\", considering it the show's strongest series since its 2005 revival. McPherson praised Smith and Gillan (noting that Amy did not have much character development), and thought that Darvill \"might just be one of the best actors on television currently\". Noting that most of the episodes were set on Earth or on spaceships, he wanted to see the Doctor, Amy and Rory \"branch out more in the future\". Dave Golder of SFX gave the series four out of five stars; it looked \"very promising\", although \"there was a tentative, slightly awkward feel to the series\" similar to the first series. He called Smith \"magnificent\" and Gillan \"lovely, although so far Amy's character has been so dictated by the requirements of the arc plot that it's difficult to feel that we've really got to know her yet\".  In a review of the first six episodes, Dan Martin of The Guardian thought that they were strong and \"generally funnier [and] appears to have rewritten the rule that said Doctor Who had to out-epic itself every year\". However, he criticised the lack of emotion which had previously inhibited the show and did not yet empathise with Amy. Martin noted that the series had a high expectation (due to the quality of Moffat's previous Doctor Who episodes) which may have disappointed those who expected \"dark, adult versions of Who every week\" as Moffat took more of a fairy-tale approach; his dialogue was \"less soapy and more spiky\" than Davies'. Revisiting previous issues, he noted that there was less emotion; however, \"when someone did die ... it ploughed heavy into the heart\". Amy was \"a revelation\", although she sometimes \"felt a little one-note\".  Gem Wheeler of Den of Geek gave the series five out of five stars, praising Smith's Doctor. Wheeler noted that Amy \"seemed a little underwritten at first, but the series finale helped to fill in the apparent gaps in her personality\"; Wheeler also praised Darvill. Slice of SciFi reviewer Michael Hickerson praised Moffat's \"fascinating\" story arc, which made the series more consistent; it gave the audience answers as it went along, and explored its impact on the characters. Hickerson called it \"the best season of the new series\", although \"there has yet to be a perfect season of the show. This one just comes closer than a lot of others\". Gavin Fuller of The Daily Telegraph, optimistic that it would \"go from strength to strength next year\", called the series \"something of a curate's egg, and perhaps not quite as strong as previous years overall\". Radio Times Patrick Mulkern praised Moffat for \"[rebooting] the series with an ambitious game-plan, a delightful fairy-tale vibe adults can enjoy too, and [finding] stars in Matt Smith, Karen Gillan and Arthur Darvill\". Although he praised Moffat's other episodes, he considered \"The Beast Below\" a \"turkey\".  The A.V. Club ranked Doctor Who the 25th best show of 2010, saying that it \"lacked a truly weak episode\" and highlighting \"The Time of Angels\"/\"Flesh and Stone\", \"Vincent and the Doctor\", and \"The Lodger\" as its best episodes. Digital Spy ranked the programme the third-best of 2010, saying that it \"gave us some terrific episodes\u00a0\u2014 the beautifully tragic 'Vincent and the Doctor', the wonderfully-paced opener and the well-imagined finale\u00a0... but also the multi-colored monstrosity 'Victory of the Daleks'. Overall, a decent enough start for the new team, but with such a strong pedigree, we couldn't help but feel a little underwhelmed.\"  Criticism After the broadcast of \"The Eleventh Hour\" (which introduced Amy as a kissogram, in a skimpy policewoman outfit, who watched the Doctor change into his new costume), it was reported that several viewers criticised the character and her occupation online as \"not fitting for a family show\". Wenger defended the character: \"The whole kissogram thing played into Steven's desire for the companion to be feisty and outspoken and a bit of a number. Amy is probably the wildest companion that the Doctor has travelled with, but she isn't promiscuous.\" Gillan defended her character, saying that girls Amy's age often wore short skirts; Amy was a \"strong female\" and a \"normal girl with normal impulses\".  Awards and nominations  Soundtrack  A two-disc soundtrack with 63 tracks of the score from this series (from \"The Eleventh Hour\" to \"The Big Bang\"), composed by Murray Gold, was released on 8 November 2010 on Silva Screen Records.

In this series, the Doctor's regenerative powers are played up in order to allow the producers to cast a new actor in the role. The new actor, Jon Pertwee, was selected from a variety of applicants, including an unknown actor named David Tennant. The fifth series was the final series of the show's original run, and is therefore often called the \"last classic series\". After the departure of the first actor to play the Doctor, William Hartnell, in the third series, the producers decided to introduce a new actor every three years, to coincide with the BBC's broadcasting seasons. This was the first time this had been done; it would become a regular practice during the classic series, and one which would continue until the show's cancellation in 1989. This series was the first to be produced in colour, although the majority of the episodes were still broadcast in black and white, as the BBC's decision to change from black and white to colour television production would not be made until the following year. However, two episodes\u2014\"The Wheel in Space\" and \"The Mind of Evil\"\u2014were specifically shot in colour for foreign broadcasts, although the BBC still transmitted them in black and white. The BBC's decision to begin colour broadcasting in November 1969 meant that, for the first time, the final episode of a Doctor Who series was broadcast in colour. This series also marked the final regular appearance of Caroline John as Liz Shaw, who left the series at the same time as the first actor to play the Doctor. In addition, the fifth series was the first to be broadcast in a different order from the one in which it was produced, due to the decision to make the final episode, \"The Wheel in Space\", the first episode to be shot in colour. The episode \"The Mind of Evil\" was originally intended as the final episode of the series, but the change in the broadcasting order gave the producers the opportunity to create a more spectacular ending for the series, by giving the story a happier conclusion and adding additional colour sequences to the existing black-and-white material. The fifth series is the first for which no episode novelisation was produced, although a number of the scripts were novelised by Terrance Dicks, in the short-lived Target Books series. It is also the first series since the show's inception to have no episodes remain in their original, pre-edited form. All the episodes have been edited or rebroadcast, with the exception of \"The Tomb of the Cybermen\", which still exists in the form of a 16mm telerecording.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 24612086}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Posthuman\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Posthuman or post-human is a concept originating in the fields of science fiction, futurology, contemporary art, and philosophy that means a person or entity that exists in a state beyond being human. The concept aims at addressing a variety of questions, including ethics and justice, language and trans-species communication, social systems, and the intellectual aspirations of interdisciplinarity.  Posthumanism is not to be confused with transhumanism (the biotechnological enhancement of human beings) and narrow definitions of the posthuman as the hoped-for transcendence of materiality. The notion of the posthuman comes up both in posthumanism as well as transhumanism, but it has a special meaning in each tradition. In 2017, Penn State University Press in cooperation with Stefan Lorenz Sorgner and James Hughes established the Journal of Posthuman Studies, in which all aspects of the concept \"posthuman\" can be analysed.  Posthumanism  In critical theory, the posthuman is a speculative being that represents or seeks to re-conceive the human. It is the object of posthumanist criticism, which critically questions humanism, a branch of humanist philosophy which claims that human nature is a universal state from which the human being emerges; human nature is autonomous, rational, capable of free will, and unified in itself as the apex of existence. Thus, the posthuman position recognizes imperfectability and disunity within oneself, and understands the world through heterogeneous perspectives while seeking to maintain intellectual rigor and dedication to objective observations.  Key to this posthuman practice is the ability to fluidly change perspectives and manifest oneself through different identities. The posthuman, for critical theorists of the subject, has an emergent ontology rather than a stable one; in other words, the posthuman is not a singular, defined individual, but rather one who can \"become\" or embody different identities and understand the world from multiple, heterogeneous perspectives.  Approaches to posthumanism are not homogeneous, and have often being very critical. The term itself is contested, with one of the foremost authors associated with posthumanism, Manuel de Landa, decrying the term as \"very silly.\" Covering the ideas of, for example, Robert Pepperell's The Posthuman Condition, and Hayles's How We Became Posthuman under a single term is distinctly problematic due to these contradictions.  The posthuman is roughly synonymous with the \"cyborg\" of A Cyborg Manifesto by Donna Haraway. Haraway's conception of the cyborg is an ironic take on traditional conceptions of the cyborg that inverts the traditional trope of the cyborg whose presence questions the salient line between humans and robots. Haraway's cyborg is in many ways the \"beta\" version of the posthuman, as her cyborg theory prompted the issue to be taken up in critical theory. Following Haraway, Hayles, whose work grounds much of the critical posthuman discourse, asserts that liberal humanism\u2014which separates the mind from the body and thus portrays the body as a \"shell\" or vehicle for the mind\u2014becomes increasingly complicated in the late 20th and 21st centuries because information technology puts the human body in question. Hayles maintains that we must be conscious of information technology advancements while understanding information as \"disembodied,\" that is, something which cannot fundamentally replace the human body but can only be incorporated into it and human life practices.  Post-posthumanism and post-cyborg ethics The idea of post-posthumanism (post-cyborgism) has recently been introduced. This body of work outlines the after-effects of long-term adaptation to cyborg technologies and their subsequent removal, e.g., what happens after 20 years of constantly wearing computer-mediating eyeglass technologies and subsequently removing them, and of long-term adaptation to virtual worlds followed by return to \"reality.\" and the associated post-cyborg ethics (e.g. the ethics of forced removal of cyborg technologies by authorities, etc.).  Posthuman political and natural rights have been framed on a spectrum with animal rights and human rights. Posthumanism broadens the scope of what it means to be a valued life form and to be treated as such (in contrast to certain life forms being seen as less-than and being taken advantage of or killed off); it \u201ccalls for a more inclusive definition of life, and a greater moral-ethical response, and responsibility, to non-human life forms in the age of species blurring and species mixing.  \u2026 [I]t interrogates the hierarchic ordering \u2013 and subsequently exploitation and even eradication \u2013 of life forms.\u201d  Transhumanism  Definition  According to transhumanist thinkers, a posthuman is a hypothetical future being \"whose basic capacities so radically exceed those of present humans as to be no longer unambiguously human by our current standards.\" Posthumans primarily focus on cybernetics, the posthuman consequent and the relationship to digital technology. Steve Nichols published the Posthuman Movement manifesto in 1988. His early evolutionary theory of mind (MVT) allows development of sentient E1 brains. The emphasis is on systems. Transhumanism does not focus on either of these. Instead, transhumanism focuses on the modification of the human species via any kind of emerging science, including genetic engineering, digital technology, and bioengineering.  Methods  Posthumans could be completely synthetic artificial intelligences, or a symbiosis of human and artificial intelligence, or uploaded consciousnesses, or the result of making many smaller but cumulatively profound technological augmentations to a biological human, i.e. a cyborg.  Some examples of the latter are redesigning the human organism using advanced nanotechnology or radical enhancement using some combination of technologies such as genetic engineering, psychopharmacology, life extension therapies, neural interfaces, advanced information management tools, memory enhancing drugs, wearable or implanted computers, and cognitive techniques.  Posthuman future As used in this article, \"posthuman\" does not necessarily refer to a conjectured future where humans are extinct or otherwise absent from the Earth. Kevin Warwick says that both humans and posthumans will continue to exist but the latter will predominate in society over the former because of their abilities. Recently, scholars have begun to speculate that posthumanism provides an alternative analysis of apocalyptic cinema and fiction, often casting vampires, werewolves and even zombies as potential evolutions of the human form and being.  Many science fiction authors, such as Greg Egan, H. G. Wells, Isaac Asimov, Bruce Sterling, Frederik Pohl, Greg Bear, Charles Stross, Neal Asher, Ken MacLeod, Peter F. Hamilton and authors of the Orion's Arm Universe, have written works set in posthuman futures.  Posthuman God A variation on the posthuman theme is the notion of a \"posthuman god\"; the idea that posthumans, being no longer confined to the parameters of human nature, might grow physically and mentally so powerful as to appear possibly god-like by present-day human standards. This notion should not be interpreted as being related to the idea portrayed in some science fiction that a sufficiently advanced species may \"ascend\" to a higher plane of existence\u2014rather, it merely means that some posthuman beings may become so exceedingly intelligent and technologically sophisticated that their behaviour would not possibly be comprehensible to modern humans, purely by reason of their limited intelligence and imagination.

The concept of a posthuman stage is sometimes referred to as post-humanity or transhumanity. The latter terms are more common in the transhumanist movement, which views the posthuman stage as a part of a broader trend of \"transformation of the body through applied reason, especially by technologies\". The term \"posthuman\" can also refer to the time after humans have become extinct, and is used in this sense by the survivalist movement.

Irma\u2019s father was a career typesetter employed by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer for most of his life; her mother was a seamstress and clothing designer.  As a teen, Irmgard attended Lincoln High School in Seattle, and graduated from the University of Washington in 1942 with a BA degree in Communications. As a freshman, she was a member of \"Chi of Phrateres,\" a philanthropic-social organization for female college students at the University.    Born the year female swimmers became the first American women to achieve full Olympic status, Irma began her competitive swimming career as a child at Green Lake in Seattle, having local swimming champion Helene Madison as her older role model.  Quickly recognized for her natural swimming ability and competitive spirit, Imgard was invited to join the swimming team of the Washington Athletic Club in 1935, soon winning numerous local, regional, statewide, and multi-state telegraph races, and was a member of the 400-yard relay team that won the National Championship in 1938.  Groomed to compete in 1940 Summer Olympics, she continued competitive swimming after the outbreak of World War II, even though the Olympic games were suspended by the IOC.  It is very likely, had it not been for the war, she would have competed on the United States Olympic swim team, possibly alongside peer, Esther Williams of California.    She made a career as a civil servant for the Federal Government for over 40 years; starting with the Department of the Interior at Mount Rainier National Park in Washington state after graduating from college, the Department of the War (Army & Air Force) in California during the latter part of World War II, and the Social Security Administration from about 1953 in various states, including California, Kansas, Maryland and finally Washington, where she retired about 1982.  Irma married Melvin Leroy Cole of Arkansas in 1955 in Ellensburg, Washington.  Because they both worked for the same government agency, after married they rarely resided in the same city.  Although two children were born of this union, partly as a result of this forced separation, they divorced in 1963.  Besides her lifelong interest in swimming, she enjoyed travelling by train (she never got a driver\u2019s license, owned a car, or flew in a plane), investing in real estate, and researching her family history.

Hammana sits at an altitude of 1200m (about 4000\u00a0ft) above sea-level. It is in the Mount Lebanon Governorate in the district (or Caza) of Baabda. Hammana is bordered by the towns of Falougha, Shbaniye, Khraybe, Bmariam, Khalwet and Mdeirej.  Etymology  The word \"Hammana\" may have come from the name of the Phoenician Sun God \"Hammon\" or \"Hamman\". These two names are derived from the word \"Hama\" which means heat of the sun.  History  The 19th century French poet, novelist and statesman Alphonse De Lamartine visited Lebanon and spent some time in Hammana. He described the town and its surrounding lush valley in his Voyages en Orient (1835) as \"one of the most beautiful prospects ever presented to the human eye to scan in the works of a god as known as NZ007\".  Hammana has a rich diversity of religious communities consisting of Maronites, Greek Orthodox, Greek Catholics, Muslims and Druze. It is a popular summer resort destination for many Lebanese and non-Lebanese tourists.  Facilities  The village has multiple water sources like the Shaghour fall, Ain-al-Hosa spring, Al-Kadaneh spring, Ain Soltan spring, Ain Maytri spring and many more. Evergreen trees such as pines, firs, spruce as well as some cedar trees are found everywhere in the town. Hammana is known regionally for its cherries, apples and fasolia beans (lubieh hammanieh). The Sohat spring water bottling plant (now owned by Nestl\u00e9) is located nearby in Falougha.  Hammana is a mixture of a typical Lebanese village, where you can enjoy the magic of its nature and the extreme hospitality, and a small city where you can enjoy the night life and the smooth entertainment environment. It is a four seasons resort, changing colors from yellow tint in autumn, to mostly white in winter, to multi-colored in spring and dark green in summer.  Ecotourism  On 25 November 2011, Municipality of Hammana and Barcelona/Cercs Bergueda signed the agreement of the second phase for the Ecotourism Project.   Around 25 residents of Hammana signed on to be part of the project, and received training to be able to run different activities for the project.  Around 5 households in Hammana signed on to have their homes serve as guest houses to receive and host visitors for the project.  The official ecotourism launching and certificates distribution ceremony was held at the municipality public garden on Saturday July 9, 2011.  Events & Festivals  Hammana is known for its cherries, and every year the municipality holds a cherry festival, between end of May and June.  This event is usually 2 to 3 days, families visit Hammana to enjoy the activities for grown ups as for kids. from cherry picking to games and small excursions around the village. Of course local cherries and homemade goods are sold in this event. Some people even create recipes with the cherries, like kebab cherry, cherry cheesecake, and some delicious cherry jam and butter crepes.

The male is smaller than the female, but has a longer tail. The body is quite hairy, and the abdomen is barred with grey and yellow. The head has a row of black spots and the antennae are pale. The male has an iridescent purple-blue abdomen and the female's abdomen is banded with brown, cream and white. The dorsal sides of the wings are brown with red-orange highlights and a row of black spots. The ventral sides are brown with small tails, and a row of black spots that are larger in the male than in the female. The tailed emperor is found from South Africa to Kenya and Tanzania, and further north to Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is a forest species, occurring in primary forests, but also in secondary forests and forest gaps. It is found at altitudes ranging from sea level to about 1500 metres. The tailed emperor is a solitary, territorial butterfly. Both sexes mud-puddle, and the male also engages in hill-topping. The male's territorial display consists of steep, spiralling flights, with the butterfly rising up to 15 metres in a few seconds, then gliding back down to the ground. The male will pursue any other butterfly that enters its territory, sometimes attacking butterflies as large as the African giant swallowtail. The tailed emperor has been observed mud-puddling in large groups. The butterfly also browses on sap, and visits flowers for nectar. It has also been observed feeding from dead carcasses. The male's territoriality and lek-mating system make the tailed emperor a model species for the study of sexual selection. The male's courtship display includes the usual wing-quivering and -waving, as well as the unique 'high-dive'. The male will take off from a high perch and dive steeply, sometimes up to 30 metres, then glide back to the ground. This is repeated several times. The male's 'high-dive' was featured on the BBC's programme, Planet Earth. The tailed emperor is a common butterfly in urban and suburban areas, and can be seen flying around streets and settlements. It is one of the most common species seen by travellers to the African continent. The species is fairly adaptable, and is able to utilize new urban and suburban areas.

In particular, it provides an argument for the uncertainty principle on the basis of the principles of classical optics.   The concept was criticized by Heisenberg's mentor Niels Bohr, and theoretical and experimental developments have suggested that Heisenberg's intuitive explanation of his mathematical result might be misleading. While the act of measurement does lead to uncertainty, the loss of precision is less than that predicted by Heisenberg's argument when measured at the level of an individual state. The formal mathematical result remains valid, however, and the original intuitive argument has also been vindicated mathematically when the notion of disturbance is expanded to be independent of any specific state.  Heisenberg's argument  Heisenberg supposes that an electron is like a classical particle, moving in the  direction along a line below the microscope. Let the cone of light rays leaving the microscope lens and focusing on the electron make an angle   with the electron. Let  be the wavelength of the light rays. Then, according to the laws of classical optics, the microscope can only resolve the position of the electron up to an accuracy of  An observer perceives an image of the particle because the light rays strike the particle and bounce back through the microscope to the observer's eye. We know from experimental evidence that when a photon strikes an electron, the latter has a Compton recoil with momentum proportional to , where  is Planck's constant. However, the extent of \"recoil cannot be exactly known, since the direction of the scattered photon is undetermined within the bundle of rays entering the microscope.\" In particular, the electron's momentum in the  direction is only determined up to  Combining the relations for  and , we thus have  ,  which is an approximate expression of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.  Analysis of argument  Although the thought experiment was formulated as an introduction to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, one of the pillars of modern physics, it attacks the very premises under which it was constructed, thereby contributing to the development of an area of physics\u2014namely, quantum mechanics\u2014that redefined the terms under which the original thought experiment was conceived.   Quantum mechanics questions whether an electron actually has a determinate position before it is disturbed by the measurement used to establish said determinate position. Under a more thorough quantum mechanical analysis, an electron has some probability of showing up at any point in the universe, though the probability that it will be far from where one  expects becomes very low at great distances from the neighborhood in which it is originally found. In other words, the \"position\" of an electron can only be stated in terms of a probability distribution, as can predictions of where it may move.

The best-known example is the Schr\u00f6dinger's cat of quantum mechanics, which is a thought experiment in which a cat is placed in a box with a radioactive source and flask of poison. The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics implies that, after a while, the cat is simultaneously alive and dead. Yet, when one looks in the box, one sees a live cat or a dead cat, not a cat in a superposition of states. This poses the question of when exactly quantum superposition ends and a definite state is achieved. In the Heisenberg's microscope, the cat is replaced by a tiny silver ball. This ball is placed on a microscope slide, which is then inserted into the microscope. The ball is prepared so that it is in a superposition of two states: it can be either at the center of the slide or at the edge. This is similar to the way in which the cat is both alive and dead in the Schr\u00f6dinger's cat experiment. When the slide is inserted into the microscope and the image is observed, the wave function of the ball quickly collapses to a specific location. This location is not determined by any external factors, but rather by the act of observation itself. In other words, the observer causes the ball to be either at the center or at the edge of the slide. This experiment is a demonstration of the quantum measurement problem and the role of the observer in quantum mechanics. It also highlights the limitations of classical concepts, such as the position of an object, in describing quantum systems.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 3067278}

The first ignimbrite was the larger one and is named Negro Francisco and the second is called Jotabeche proper. A caldera and some lava domes are also part of the complex. Volcanism ceased 5 million years ago.  Geography and structure  Jotabeche is located at the extreme southern end of the Central Volcanic Zone (CVZ) of the Andes. The Central Volcanic Zone is one of the four volcanic zones of the Andean Volcanic Belt. In this belt, ongoing subduction of the Antarctica plate, Nazca plate and its precursor the Farallon plate are responsible for ongoing volcanic activity, including such volcanoes as Villarrica and Nevado del Ruiz. The Central Volcanic Zone sub-belt itself contains about 44 volcanic centres and over five major Quaternary caldera and ignimbrite complexes. The so-called Abancay deflection separates the CVZ in the north from the Peruvian flat subduction segment where no volcanic activity occurs, while the southern limit is marked by a seismic discontinuity around 27\u00b0 S.  Jotabeche is a  high volcano with a caldera. A rhyolitic dome formed inside of the caldera. The Jotabeche complex reaches a thickness of  when including ignimbrite, lava domes and lavas. The  high and  wide Jotabeche Norte stratovolcano is found northeast of Jotabeche and is surrounded by pyroclastic flows. The Santa Cecilia lava domes () have diameters of  and sit along a  long fault. The Miocene volcanic complex branches out in four chains stretching in east-west direction, the Cadillal, Aguas Blancas, Jotabeche Norte and Cordon de Yeguas Heladas. N-S to NE-SW trending faults border the volcanic complex and have allowed the intrusion of diorite porphyries. The resulting hydrothermally altered rocks are the sites of mineral deposits and prospects. These faults include the Yeguas Heladas, Rio La Gallina and Rio Astaburuaga and form a hexagonal structure which partly forms the margin of the caldera. Otherwise, only little erosion has taken place at Jotabeche; stronger erosion though has exposed a > thick hydrothermally altered complex at Aldebaran-Cerro Casale. Other hydrothermally altered areas are found within depressions. The crust beneath Jotabeche reaches a thickness of .  Geology  Jotabeche is a volcanic centre in the 26-6 mya old and  long Maricunga belt. Some stratovolcanoes in the belt include Copiap\u00f3-Azufre, Cerros Bravos, Do\u00f1a In\u00e9s, La Laguna, Lagunillas, Ojos del Maricunga, Santa Rosa and Cadillal-Yeguas Heladas. Volcanic activity in this belt has also generated porphyry deposits containing silver, gold and copper. This belt is bordered by graben and horst tectonic structures that have generated the Salar de Maricunga and the Laguna de Negro Francisco.  Jotabeche is located at the southern end of the Maricunga belt, which was active starting from the Oligocene until the Pliocene. The formation of this volcanic belt was influenced by the changes in the subduction of the Nazca plate, which included the shallowing of the subducting plate and the formation of the Puna plateau. Jotabeche, belonging to the fourth stage of Maricunga belt activity after the third stage of Copiapo, is the youngest eruption of the Maricunga belt, whose activity ended with the Jotabeche caldera forming eruption. Volcanism afterwards shifted eastwards. Jotabeche is one of the largest volcanoes in the Maricunga belt. Volcanic activity at Jotabeche is coeval with the last mineralization phase of the Vallecito system in the El Indio belt.  Local  Jotabeche is part of the so-called Cordillera de Darwin segment of the Andes. The basement in the area consists of various sedimentary-volcanic formations dating back to the Paleozoic Chinches formation but also including the Jurassic Lautaro formation and the Cretaceous Quebrada de Monardes formation. Of the volcanic formations, the Pantanoso rhyolitic formation of the Paleozoic and the thick andesitic-dacitic lava flows of the mesozoic Rio Aguas Blancas formation are the most important. During the Cretaceous, local extension formed a number of small faults in the area. The oldest of these sequences crops out east of Jotabeche at the Chilean-Argentine frontier.  Composition  Jotabeche has generated rhyodacite rocks. The Negro Francisco ignimbrite is rhyolitic while the Jotabeche ignimbrite itself is of rhyodacitic composition. Specific  concentrations are 65\u201370% for Negro Francisco while the caldera complex has 68\u201372%. The Jotabeche Norte stratovolcano has a concentration of 60% and is considered to be hornblende andesite in terms of composition. Overall, all rocks fit the potassium-rich calc alkaline pattern. Gold-rich porphyry deposits are found on Jotabeche's flanks. Diorites are also found but the only weak erosion and thick late Miocene rock cover bury them. Other mineralizations are found between Jotabeche and the Salar de Maricunga.  The chemistry of Jotabeche ignimbrites is distinct from other Tertiary volcanic rocks in the Andes. The rocks of Jotabeche have lanthanum, strontium and yttrium concentrations which fit an eclogitic trend, similar to other Andean volcanoes Pircas Negras, Tortolas and Vallecito. More generally, the geochemistry is indicative of the volcanic activity being influenced both by a thick crust and other factors of crustal contamination. Other composition data are indicative of a drop in mantle water content above the shallowing slab. The crust above the Jotabeche ignimbrite source region was thick enough to permit the stability of garnet in said source region.  Glaciation  Jotabeche does not currently display any perennial snow, only during summer is snow observed in the area. Likewise, rock glaciers are only found as fossil remnants. However, moraines are found at Jotabeche, and glaciers advanced north from a cirque on its northern flank into the Laguna de Negro Francisco, where a peninsula marks the position of the most extensive moraine.  Eruptive history  Jotabeche was active between 7 and 5 mya ago, spanning the late Miocene and Pliocene. The end of volcanic activity at Jotabeche occurred at the same time as the northeastern arm of the Juan Fernandez ridge passed beneath the volcano. After end of activity at Jotabeche volcanism occurred farther east at Incapillo. 15.3 \u00b1 0.8 and 17.2 \u00b1 0.7 mya the Las Gallinas ignimbrite formed east of Jotabeche, but its origin is unknown.  The Santa Cecilia domes of Jotabeche were active 24.3 \u00b1 0.7 mya and 24.1 \u00b1 0.8 mya based on potassium-argon dating of an eroded tuff ring. Between 18 and 16 mya the Jotabeche Norte stratovolcano was active in the region. Some rhyolitic lava domes intruded into the caldera are 10 mya old. The Negro Francisco ignimbrite was erupted 8.5 mya ago and covers a surface area of  around the Laguna del Negro Francisco; it is the initial activity of Jotabeche. 5.9\u20136.2 mya the Jotabeche ignimbrite covered a surface area of . The Negro Francisco ignimbrite was erupted from a NW-trending fault and flowed between the Jotabeche Norte and La Laguna stratovolcanoes to the Laguna del Negro Francisco depression and across it. The so-called Pircas Negras andesitic lava flows occur at the same time as the younger Jotabeche activity. Andesitic-dacitic lava domes along the La Gallina fault are of the same age.  At Copiapo and Jotabeche, the volcanic activity has been subdivided in three phases, the first being the \"normal\" volcanic phase, a second phase with a drop in magma supply and the formation of more differentiated magmas in crustal magma chambers such as rhyolites and at the end the eruption of andesites along fractures. Other volcanoes in the Maricunga belt display different evolutionary processes, probably because of a lesser tectonic influence.  Archeology  Research performed on Jotabeche in the 1980s demonstrated the existence of a shrine on Jotabeche. People probably climbed the mountain to use it during the southern summer months. Archeological sites in the region are not unknown: Copiapo, Incahuasi, Pastillitos and Los Patos also have archeological sites.

The group's music is influenced by the members' shared Chilean and Latin American culture, as well as by the hip hop music of the United States. The group's name is a portmanteau of the words \"Jota\" (meaning \"slang\" in Chilean Spanish) and \"Bicho\" (meaning \"animal\" in Chilean Spanish). According to the group, the name is meant to convey the idea that they are \"just animals\" who love hip hop. Jotabeche's music is characterized by its strong, deep bass lines, as well as by the group's use of samples, which they use to create a sound that is both retro and modern. The group's lyrics are often political in nature, and they are known for their use of Chile's social and political issues as a source of inspiration. Jotabeche has released three albums to date: Jotabeche (2008), Jotabeb\u00f3 (2010), and Jotachela (2012).

In 1801 he earned his doctorate at the University of Jena, where he had as instructors; botanist August Batsch (1761\u20131802) and philosophers Friedrich Schelling (1775\u20131854) and Johann Gottlieb Fichte (1762\u20131814). In 1807 he was a professor at the Lyceum at Bremen, and in 1812 became a professor of natural history and botany at the University of Rostock, where he was also director of the botanical gardens. In 1816 he replaced Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link (1767\u20131851) as professor of botany at the University of Breslau, and in 1820 transferred to the University of Bonn, where he was successor to Christian Gottfried Daniel Nees von Esenbeck (1776\u20131858). Treviranus remained at Bonn until his death in 1864.  In his earlier studies, he worked mostly in the fields of plant anatomy and physiology, afterwards focusing on taxonomic issues. Between 1815 and 1828, he published noted works on the sexuality and embryology of phanerogams. He is credited for discovery of the intercellular space in a plant's parenchyma.

They sailed around the world, visiting South America, Easter Island, Hawaii, and Alaska, and returned to Russian Alaska in 1820. In 1823, Treviranus published an account of the expedition, entitled Reise um die Welt in den Jahren 1818 bis 1821. In 1827, Treviranus was appointed professor of zoology at the University of Erlangen. In 1840, he became professor of natural history at the University of Breslau, where he remained until his death. Treviranus was a friend of the writer and poet Johann Peter Hebel and the composer Robert Schumann.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Monsoon Shootout\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Monsoon Shootout is a 2013 Indian Hindi-language neo-noir action thriller film written and directed by Amit Kumar and produced by Guneet Monga, Trevor Ingma, Martijn de Grunt, and co-produced by Anurag Kashyap, and Vivek Rangachari, starring Vijay Varma, Geetanjali Thapa, Sreejita De, Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Tannishtha Chatterjee in the lead roles.  The film received positive reviews at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival in the Official Midnight Screenings section. Belonging to the school of Parallel cinema, Monsoon Shootout was released worldwide four years later on 15 December 2017 to positive reviews.  Plot As the raging monsoon lashes Mumbai, the commercial and mafia capital of India, the police struggle to keep up with the gangsters who are ever more emboldened. Aditya \u201cAdi\u201d, a principled rookie cop as his first assignment on the force, joins an elite, anti-extortion unit of the Mumbai police led by Khan, a cop in the \u2018Dirty Harry\u2019 mold. On his first evening on the job, Adi had planned to meet his ex-lover Anu and to get back with her, but he misses the date when Khan has set up an ambush for a dreaded gangster.  However, the ambush goes wrong, and Adi chases Shiva, a seemingly armed and dangerous criminal, into a dead-end alley. Unsure if Shiva is, indeed, the wanted gangster, Adi has a moment of reckoning; whether to shoot or not to shoot. Whatever his decision is, every decision will take him on a journey that pits him against a system which demands a compromise of his morals. As he lives through the dramatic consequences of each decision, he realizes that every choice has its price.

This idea came to fruition in the form of Monsoon Shootout.  Kumar had previously assisted film director Asif Kapadia on his BAFTA-winning feature The Warrior where he met Trevor Ingman. Ingman decided to help seek finances for Kumar's film starting in 2008, but was unable to do so because of the closure of the UK Film Council which was initially supposed to cover half the production costs. Kumar set sights to find an Indian production partner, and in 2010, he ran into Guneet Monga who had produced Michael Winterbottom's Trishna. When Kumar stated his lack of an Indian producer, Monga immediately jumped at the opportunity to fund the film. However, the producers decided that although they loved Kumar's script and idea, they felt he needed to cast a star in the lead role. Kumar worked with Nawazuddin Siddiqui in his student short film The Bypass and decided to cast him in the lead role.  Reception The Times of India's Lasyapriya Sundaram rated the film 3/5, praising the cinematography of Rajeev Ravi and Vijay Varma's debut performance in a lead role. She opines that \"while the idea hooks the viewer, what fails the film is its execution\", also critiquing that \"since the actors reprise their roles thrice over, they often don't have enough screen time to flesh out their characters adequately\".  Saibal Chatterjee writing in NDTV headlines the review saying, \"Nawazuddin Siddiqui's Noir Thriller Is Absorbing, Even Startling\". He describes the film as \"Shot through with stylistic flourishes and narrative sleights that frequently add up to arresting images and moments, first-time director Amit Kumar's niftily crafted Monsoon Shootout is absorbing, even startling. The propulsive, crisply edited noir thriller set in Mumbai's dark, dank and dangerous underbelly is consistently intriguing on account of its structure. Add to this the film's all-around technical finesse and the near-flawless performances from the principal actors and you have a crime drama that has the feel of a veritable tour de force.\" He praises the score by Gingger Shankar, defining it as pulsating with the energy that adds a throbbing soundscape to the film. Rating it as 3/5, he recommends the film to viewers saying \"Don't prevaricate or duck for cover. Walk right into the path of this slickly staged shootout. You won't regret the decision.\"  Shalini Langer writing in The Indian Express, finds the film somewhat lacking in consistency but overall praises the director, actors and especially the cinematographer Rajeev Ravi for capturing the unglamorous side of Mumbai in all its ambiguity.  Mint's Uditi Jhunjhunwala finds the film \"a technically accomplished, but emotionally wanting, noir thriller\".  Cannes reception The film was shown during the French 2013 Cannes Film Festival in theMidnight Screenings section. Early Cannes reception for the film has been positive with many international critics taking a liking to the film's noir, artistic detailing.  British newspaper The Guardian'''s Peter Bradshaw gave a very positive first look review of the film stating that it's \"a brash exploitation picture, a violent thriller on the tough streets of Mumbai about rule-breaking, bone-breaking cops\" and \"an entertaining popcorn movie with a twist, for which commercial success is on the cards.\" He described the film as \"Dirty Harry meets Sliding Doors.\"The Hollywood Reporter'''s Deborah Young described the film as \"a ferocious Mumbai cops and gangsters drama, and a satisfyingly arty plot that turns in on itself to examine the outcome of three possible choices a rookie cop might make when he confronts a ruthless killer. Three times the story returns to a key moment: a boy with a gun uncertain whether to pull the trigger.\" She had major praise for Nawazuddin Siddiqui's performance, stating that \"Most memorable of all is Siddiqui, who is every inch an unstoppable force of nature, and lucky we are that so much of the violence he wreaks happens off-camera.\"  Soundtrack The soundtrack was released by Saregama Music.

The film stars Vijay Sethupathi, who also produced the film, as a cop with a 100 percent hit rate in hostage situations, and he is called to save a school bus full of children during a monsoon. The film's origins can be traced back to 2015 when Kumar, an erstwhile assistant of Vetrimaaran, made a short film with Vijay titled Karuppu Vellai. It was well received and they decided to develop it into a feature film. However, due to Vijay's commitments to other projects, the film remained in the development hell until late 2018 when he agreed to produce the film under his newly launched banner, Vijay Sethupathi Productions. The film was shot in two schedules; the first schedule was shot in November 2019 in Chennai, while the second schedule was shot in March 2020 in Blessy. In between the two schedules, Vijay went on to complete his work on other films. The film's title was revealed in November 2019. The film was initially scheduled for a theatrical release in September 2020, but was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in India. It was then scheduled for a direct-to-digital release on Disney+ Hotstar in September 2020, but was again postponed due to Vijay's other film, Master, getting a theatrical release.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"William Smith (loyalist)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "William \"Plum\" Smith (sometimes erroneously spelt Smyth) (26 January 1954 \u2013 8 June 2016) was a Northern Irish loyalist, former paramilitary, and politician. He had been involved in Ulster loyalism in various capacities for at least forty years.  Early life Smith was born in Mountjoy Street on Belfast's Shankill Road into a poor Ulster Protestant family, the son of shipyard worker Charles William Smith and his wife Isobel. He had three older sisters, Margaret, Elizabeth and Nan (the latter dying in infancy before he was born), a younger brother Gordon and a younger sister Jean. There was rumoured Native American ancestry in his family; therefore in his youth he acquired the lifelong nickname \"Plum\" after The Beano character Little Plum. He was raised in a working class home where his parents sent him to Sunday school and taught him to respect the law. Like many of his contemporaries from similar backgrounds on both sides of the divide, the outbreak of the socio-political\religious conflict that came to be known as the Troubles in 1969 saw him become involved in paramilitarism.  Move to paramilitarism Following the introduction of internment in 1971, Smith worked for a time as an orderly in Crumlin Road Gaol where he served six months for rioting against the British Army in the Highfield estate. Unbeknownst to the prison authorities, Smith was working as a mole for the imprisoned Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) leader Gusty Spence, passing on information about the conditions in which the internees were being held.  Around this time Smith was a member of the vigilante group and was part of a group within the SDA that later became the Red Hand Commando, including founder John McKeague, who decided to form a new, more active organisation. In 1972, Smith was a founder-member of this new group, which quickly became an elite squad augmenting the UVF.  On 1 July Smith was one of two armed RHC men to meet Spence when he was released from prison to attend the wedding of his daughter to Winkie Rea. He took Spence to a meeting of the UVF leadership where a plan was hatched to keep Spence out of prison. A few days later when Spence was being returned to jail by his nephew Frankie Curry, their car was stopped on Belfast's Springmartin Road and Spence \"kidnapped\" by UVF/RHC operatives.  Soon after this incident Smith was himself arrested for his part in the attempted murder of Catholic civilian Joseph Hall, a drive-by shooting that Smith would later admit was motivated by \"pure sectarianism and bigotry\". Smith was handed a ten-year prison sentence for the shooting. Tried along with Ronnie McCullough and Tom Reid, Smith pleaded not guilty although he subsequently admitted that he did so to satisfy the UVF's policy of members never pleading guilty and would state that \"we were caught red-handed\".  In the Maze Along with the likes of Billy Hutchinson, David Ervine and Billy Mitchell, Smith was one of those on the UVF wings of the Maze prison in the 1970s to be won over by Gusty Spence to his newer, more politicised, way of thinking. This cadre of Spence-trained political figures would go on to play a leading role in bringing about the UVF ceasefire in 1994 as members of the Progressive Unionist Party (PUP). He learnt Irish during his time in prison, and was happy to refer to the language as 'his own'. Smith was released on 28 July 1977 after serving five years of a ten-year sentence.  Political activity  Smith secured a job in the Harland & Wolff shipyard in 1978 and became involved in trade union activity, initially as a shop steward before ultimately ending up a member of the general executive of the Transport & General Workers Union. He was dismissed from the shipyard in 1988 following a period of restructuring that involved a sell-off of part of the business, although Smith contended that his trade union activity had hastened his removal by making him unpopular with the management.  At this point the unemployed Smith became involved with a number of community schemes on the Shankill Road that were organised by Gusty Spence, initially in a voluntary capacity. The two became close and when Spence undertook a reorganisation of the PUP in 1990, Smith was given the role of chairman and Prisons Spokesman, along with Hugh Smyth as leader, David Ervine as Political Spokesman and Spence and Jim McDonald as members of the party executive.  Through Spence, Smith established contacts with Joe Colgan, a Dublin-based Irish republican, and in March 1993 the two arranged an event in the city at which both a member of the UVF and the trade unionist Chris Hudson were in attendance. As a result of the meeting Hudson opened a regular channel of contact with the UVF through which he exhorted them to seek peace.  The Combined Loyalist Military Command (CLMC) ceasefire was announced on 13 October 1994 at Fernhill House, Glencairn when Gusty Spence read out a joint statement of ceasefire flanked by Smith and Jim McDonald of the PUP and Ulster Democratic Party representatives Gary McMichael, Davy Adams and John White. Smith was the chairman of the press conference at which Spence read out the statement. For a time he had served as Chairman of the Progressive Unionist Party itself.  Smith would go on to devote his attentions to community work with the Ex-Prisoners Interpretative Centre although he has remained a spokesman for the PUP. He was also an unsuccessful candidate for the PUP in the Belfast City Council elections in 2001 in the Court district electoral area.  Speaking out in 2012 about Unionist concerns at the Maze prison becoming an IRA shrine with a proposed Conflict Transformation Centre, Smith stated that if Loyalists themselves got involved in the scheme they could tell their side of the story and no one particular group could use it as a shrine.  Opposition to trials In 2009 Smith was strongly critical of the report issued by the Consultative Group on the Past, as chaired by Robin Eames and Denis Bradley. He criticised the work of the Historical Enquiries Team, which investigated unsolved incidents from the Troubles, arguing that it was opening \"a can of worms\" and preventing \"closure\". He compared any attempts to reopen investigations and bring about criminal proceedings to the Nuremberg trials.  In 2010 Smith attacked the work of Victims Commissioner Brendan McAllister, who was investigating the activities of the UVF unit based on the Mount Vernon estate, north Belfast, during the Troubles. Smith argued that such investigations contravened a guarantee he had been given by Mo Mowlam that offences committed before 1998 could not be prosecuted due to a general amnesty. Soon afterwards Smith claimed that a document released by the British and Irish governments proved that the deal was in place as he claimed. In support of his stance Smith even gave evidence at the trial of Gerry McGeough, arguing that the republican should not have been tried for the 1981 attempted murder of Sammy Brush because of the supposed deal being in place.  Book Smith launched his book Inside Man, Loyalists of Long Kesh \u2013 The Untold Story () on 13 October 2014, the twentieth anniversary of the CLMC ceasefire. The book argues that thanks to politicisation and education a group of prominent loyalists prisoners came to support negotiation with their republican counterparts, leading to the eventual Northern Ireland peace process. The book mainly dealt with the experiences of loyalist prisoners within the Maze and was not intended as an autobiography.  Death Smith died on 8 June 2016, aged 62 after a short illness. Former PUP leader Brian Ervine paid tribute to his negotiating skills by bringing the RHC & UVF to the peace process, his intelligence, left thinking politics and for his cross community work. Sinn F\u00e9in Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness praised his contribution and commitment to the peace process.  His funeral was held in St. Matthew's Church of Ireland on the Woodvale Road. Community worker and former loyalist prisoner Jim Wilson described Smith's contribution to loyalism as 'massive' during The Troubles but later became an 'architect of peace'. Wilson also commented that Sinn F\u00e9in representative's presence at the funeral proved Smith's sincerity at extending the hand of friendship across the sectarian divide.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Lucy and Ricky Ricardo\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Lucy and Ricky Ricardo, also known simply as Lucy and Ricky or the Ricardos, are fictional characters from the American television sitcom I Love Lucy, portrayed respectively by Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz. The Ricardos also appear in The Lucy\u2013Desi Comedy Hour, and Lucy also appears in one episode of The Ann Sothern Show.  Together, Lucy and Ricky serve as a double act. Ricky is the straight man, a character very similar to Arnaz himself; he is a Cuban-American bandleader whose trademark song is \"Babalu\". Red-haired Lucy is his wife, who always gets into trouble and is usually caught at it by Ricky. Their son, Ricky Ricardo Jr. (usually called \"Little Ricky\"), was born in the middle of the show's second season. He was portrayed by child actor Richard Keith beginning in season 6.  Lucy's full name (Lucille Esmeralda Ricardo  McGillicuddy) is given in the Season 1 episodes \"Fred and Ethel Fight\" and \"The Marriage License,\" and \"The Passports\" in Season 5. Ricky gives his full name in the Season 4 episode \"Hollywood Anniversary\" as Ricardo Alberto Fernando Ricardo y de Acha, but in the Season 6 episode \"Lucy Raises Tulips\" Lucy calls him \"Enrique Alberto Fernando Ricardo y de Acha III\".  Fictional character biographies  Early lives  Much like Lucille Ball herself, Lucy McGillicuddy was born and raised in Jamestown, New York (or West Jamestown as revealed in Season 5), to an American family of Scottish descent. In one episode in which she is asked her birthday, she gives it as August 6 (the same as Ball's), though in typical fashion, she refuses to give the year; in another, where she is forced to tell the truth, she says she is 33 years old. This episode aired during the third season in 1953. This makes her born in the year 1920.   In the episode, her parents are never referred to by name, and only her mother (portrayed by Kathryn Card) is seen over the course of the series. No other family is even mentioned, except for a passing reference to her grandmother being Swedish (Jamestown has a large Swedish community). In the season 5 episode \"The Passports\", it is established she was born in 1921, therefore is exactly 10 years younger than Ball in real life.  In grammar school, she played a petunia in a recital. In high school, she was involved in the drama program, wherein she studied with Miss Hanna and played Juliet Capulet in Romeo and Juliet. She also played the saxophone in high school (as did the real Lucy), though every song she played sounded like \"The Glow-Worm\". Lucy also knows how to play the ukulele. She is seen playing a ukulele in episodes \"Ricky Loses His Voice\", \"Don Juan is Shelved\", and \"Little Ricky Gets Stage Fright\".  A reference to Lucille's attendance at an unnamed junior college is made in the episode \"Fan Magazine Interview\" (1954); Jamestown Community College, the nearest junior college to Lucy's hometown, did not exist until 1950, although a business college and nursing school did exist in the city at the time.  Marriage  When she was 22, Lucy was set up on a blind date by her friend Marion Strong. Her blind date turned out to be a Cuban conga drummer, Ricky Ricardo. The two fell in love and eventually got married at the Byram River Beagle Club in Connecticut. An alternate scenario given to guest star Hedda Hopper in the Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour episode \"Lucy Takes a Cruise to Havana,\" with Lucy and friend Susie McNamara (Ann Sothern, reprising her role from Private Secretary), is that Lucy met Ricky while vacationing in Cuba in 1940.  In the early 1940s, Lucy and Ricky moved into an old reconverted brownstone apartment at 623 East 68th Street in New York City (references made during the series date the move to 1940 or 1943). In reality, this address does not exist (the last numbered building on E 68th Street is 590, so this address would be in the East River). The apartment rented for $105 per month. Their landlords (soon to be best friends) were Fred and Ethel Mertz. Lucy and Ethel quickly became best friends, even though Ethel is older than Lucy. Upon moving to the city, Ricky ends up getting a job headlining the Tropicana where he and his band are held over indefinitely.  To Lucy, Ricky's career and days seem so much more exciting than her days of cooking and cleaning. She desperately wants to be a star and constantly tries to get into Ricky's act. Ricky wants his wife to remain a homemaker. However, in spite of Ricky's reluctance and regular refusal to give her a role, Lucy sometimes finds a way into the show.  Birth of Little Ricky  In 1952, after going to the doctor complaining of feeling \"dauncey\" (a word her grandmother made up; Lucy's definition of feeling \"dauncey\" is when you are not really sick but just feel lousy) and gaining weight, she learns that she is pregnant. It is actually Ethel who first suggests to Lucy she may be expecting, even before Lucy heads out to the doctor. Lucy is very excited to tell her husband the news.  The Mertzes learn the news first and are sworn to secrecy. When she was younger, Lucy had envisioned how she would tell her husband they were going to have a baby. She decides to tell Ricky when he comes home for lunch that afternoon. However, with repeated interruptions from the telephone and the Mertzes, she is unable. She tries to tell him down at his club during rehearsals, but is uncomfortable telling him such a personal thing in front of his band, so she runs out crying.  Finally, that evening, while Ricky is performing, Lucy pens a note and passes it to the ma\u00eetre d'hotel. He gives the note to Ricky. Ricky reads the note, which alludes to a wife needing to tell her husband they are having a baby, and requests that he sing a particular song. Ricky, unaware that the \"husband\" mentioned in the note is himself, wants to bring the expectant couple up on stage to congratulate them. He goes from couple to couple trying to find them. Ricky notices Lucy in the audience, and it occurs to him that Lucy may be the one who is expecting. Lucy nods yes, and Ricky is overcome with emotion. They sing \"We're Having a Baby\", with Lucille Ball actually breaking down in tears during the scene.  During her pregnancy, Lucy experiences the normal pregnancy woes. She becomes depressed when everyone seems to focus their attention on the impending child and not on Lucy. She cannot decide on a name for the child and is nervous that she will not be a good mother. However, she wants the best for her child and enrolls herself, Ricky, and the Mertzes in elocution lessons to make sure her child learns how to speak properly. Finally, she takes up sculpting so she and Ricky can enrich their child's life with art and music. However, Lucy's show business aspirations never wane. She manages to break into Ricky's barbershop quartet number by firing the man who has the part she wants.  Finally, on January 19, 1953 \u2014 the same day she had her real-life son Desi Arnaz Jr. (technically IV) \u2014 while husband Ricky is performing a voodoo act at his nightclub, Lucy gives birth to Ricky Ricardo Jr. The Mertzes are named Little Ricky's godparents. Little Ricky grows on a season-by-season basis, and by the sixth season (1957), he has started school and learned to play the drums and speak Spanish.  Hollywood  In 1954, Ricky is given a role in an upcoming MGM film based on the life of Don Juan. Lucy and the Mertzes follow Ricky on his journey to Hollywood stardom. While in Hollywood, Lucy meets many famous celebrities, including William Holden, Hedda Hopper, Rock Hudson, Cornel Wilde, Harpo Marx, Richard Widmark, Van Johnson and John Wayne. Some of these actors are celebrities that Ricky has already met as a result of his work.  She reports having spotted 99 celebrities while in Hollywood and finally procures an even 100 when she meets Wilde. Lucy is incredibly starstruck and saves anything that had come in contact with a celebrity, such as a can smashed by Cary Grant's left rear wheel. However, she does not just hobnob with celebrities; she also gets a few chances to break into show business herself.  Ricky gets her a small role in a film as a showgirl. Lucy's role requires her to wear a large headdress; she also gets a death scene. However, the headdress proves cumbersome, and her part is downgraded. She eventually ends up as a showgirl who is already dead on a stretcher when the scene begins. Lucy's second foray into show business is when she replaces Van Johnson's sick redheaded partner in his act at the hotel. She wants to impress her friend Carolyn Appleby and successfully coaxes Johnson give her the job through flattery.  Finally, she has her third shot at stardom when she appears with a Ricky Ricardo dummy at a luncheon for movie executives. Ricky was asked to perform, but he declined in favor of a fishing trip he had planned. Lucy accepted on his behalf and schemed to build a dummy of Ricky and then pretend that he is ill, and she finishes the show herself. Her plan does not go as well as she had hoped, but she is still a success, as the executives think the performance is meant to be a comedy act, and she is offered a contract. However, she declines when she realizes that it would take her away from her husband, son and friends.  Europe  Very soon after returning home from Hollywood, Ricky's band is given a chance to tour around Europe. Fred is recruited as Ricky's band manager and Lucy and Ethel tag along. Lucy misses the boat and has to be lowered to the deck of the cruise ship, the USS Constitution, from a helicopter. They sail across the Atlantic, where Lucy has to settle for being partnered with a young boy to play games on deck but together they win a ping pong trophy. She also manages to get stuck in a porthole.  After landing in England, Lucy gets the chance to perform for and meet Queen Elizabeth. She also participates in a fox hunt and gets to stay at an English estate.  In Paris, she meets Charles Boyer who has been warned by Ricky not to admit who he is because Lucy is so star-struck; Boyer takes his advice when Lucy corners him and claims he is Maurice DuBois, an out-of-work actor. Ricky has feigned jealousy about Lucy's obsession with Charles Boyer so she hires \"DuBois\" to impersonate Boyer and pitch woo to her in front of Ricky so she can reassure him with her total lack of interest. She coaches \"DuBois\" on Boyer's \"growl\" and mannerisms, remaining unaware that he is the real Boyer until Ethel calls her and reveals Ricky and Boyer's trick.  In another episode, Lucy is arrested by French police after inadvertently using counterfeit money. The scene that ensues, after Ricky arrives to bail her out, involves the only-French-speaking Commandante interrogating Lucy by directing questions to his French-and-German-speaking Lieutenant in French, who translates the questions into German and directs them to a drunken German-and-Spanish-speaking prisoner, who translates the questions into Spanish to ask Spanish-and-English-speaking Ricky, who makes the final translation into English for Lucy. Her answers must travel back up the chain to the Commandante.  Also, she stomps on grapes in Turo, a winemaking town in Italy, and wrestles her professional grape-stomping partner in a grape vat.  Moving to Connecticut  In 1956, Lucy and Ricky decide to move to Connecticut after making a trip there, and Lucy falls in love with the area. Before they move in, though, she tries unsuccessfully to get out of the deal. Soon the Ricardos decide to raise chickens and sell the eggs. To help them with their business, their best friends, Fred Mertz and Ethel Mertz, move into their guest house, as Fred was raised on a farm. Lucy and Ricky also make close friends while in Connecticut, Betty and Ralph Ramsey (the Ricardos' next door neighbors).  After I Love Lucy I Love Lucy and The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour concluded in the aftermath of Arnaz and Ball's real-life divorce in 1960, an incident that was not written into the script. The characters remained married to each other at the end of the series' run.  Lucille Ball would go on to perform Lucy Ricardo-inspired characters on her ensuing sitcoms: The Lucy Show, Here's Lucy, and the short-lived Life with Lucy. In each series, the character Ball portrayed (each one named Lucy) was a widow or divorce\u00e9. In the mid-1960s, she was involved in a lawsuit against Jess Oppenheimer, the co-creator of I Love Lucy, over the similarities among the separate Lucy characters. The dispute was later settled out of court.  Arnaz only portrayed a similar Ricky Ricardo character once after The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour ended its run: in a recurring role on The Mothers-in-Law, Arnaz portrayed matador Raphael Delgado, with the same accent and personality as Ricky (as a Desilu production, The Mothers-in-Law used many of the same writers and executive staff as the Lucy shows).  Other television series, especially those created by Desilu (the production company Arnaz and Ball co-founded) sought to copy the Lucy Ricardo theme. Even Janis Paige, in her short-lived Desilu produced CBS sitcom It's Always Jan, wore her hair like Lucy's, and Cara Williams followed the Lucy Ricardo format in Pete and Gladys, which lasted only two seasons on CBS.

The characters were portrayed by Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, respectively, and appeared in the series' entire run, from October 15, 1951, to May 6, 1957. The Ricardos are a married couple who live in a two-bedroom apartment in New York City, with Lucy working as a magician's assistant and Ricky as a bandleader. While Lucy dreams of becoming a performer, Ricky is concerned with his career and wants to avoid the trappings of show business. Their marriage is tested by the couple's mutual interest in show business, as well as their mutual distaste for living in the city. In the first season, the couple has a neighbor, Mrs. Trumbull, who often babysits for the couple's child, Little Ricky (known as Richard, Jr. in later seasons). In the second and third seasons, the couple has a best friend, Mary Caroline \"Carrie\" Snodgress, who often visits and looks after the couple's interests in the country. In the fourth season, the couple moves to the country and purchases a farm, with Snodgress living nearby. In 2002, the American Film Institute ranked the couple at No. 5 on their list of the greatest movie couples of all time. In 2008, the couple was ranked the second-greatest TV couple of all time by the same institute. In 2013, TV Guide ranked the couple at No. 1 in its list of the 60 Best Couples of All Time. The relationship between Lucy and Ricky Ricardo has been compared to the relationship between Ball and Arnaz off-screen, and the two were often described as \"carbon copies\" of each other. The couple's relationship was also influenced by the real-life relationship between Ball and Arnaz, who were married to each other at the time the series was produced. I Love Lucy was Arnaz's brainchild, and he intended for the series to be a vehicle for his real-life wife, Ball. The couple's relationship was further complicated by the fact that, during the series' run, Ball and Arnaz were having an affair with each other.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 11167343}

The character is a movie star whose personality traits and life events are taken from Morgan's own life. In 2010, Entertainment Weekly ranked him the 55th Greatest Character of the Last 20 Years.  For his portrayal of Jordan, Tracy Morgan has received one Primetime Emmy Award nomination, two Image Awards nominations, and seven Screen Actors Guild Award nominations, winning one.  Concept Tracy Jordan is a rich, famous B-list movie star with a reputation for unpredictable behavior. At the time newly installed NBC executive Jack Donaghy forces writer Liz Lemon to hire Jordan as the new star of her sketch comedy program The Girlie Show in the pilot episode of the series, Jordan was in a career slump, having made no new movies for two years. Upon hiring Tracy, Jack renames the show TGS with Tracy Jordan, much to the chagrin of Liz. Throughout the series, Jordan enjoys renewed success through his starring TGS role and other performances and ventures.  Character history Jordan is a descendant of Thomas Jefferson and slave Sally Hemings. Jordan was born in Yankee Stadium but the exact date is unknown as he has no birth certificate. He was given the honorary birthday of February 24, shared with TGS Co-star Jenna Maroney in the March 5, 2009 episode \"Goodbye, My Friend\". Tracy grew up in a tough neighborhood in The Bronx called \u2018Knuckle Beach\u2019, though many of his claims about it sound fictitious. As a child, Jordan was a cast member on the Nickelodeon show Ray Ray's Mystery Garage. He also claims to have attended middle school in an Exxon station. He lived with his single mother in 1979, dropped out of Frank Lucas High School over his inability to dissect a frog, and claims to have spent time busking as a bucket drummer. He was discovered after doing stand-up at the Apollo in 1984. Jordan did a Christmas album in 1998 and is a big fan of Pat Benatar. In addition to his acting career, he writes a column in Ebony Magazine called \"Musings\". He owns several houses but got into debt because he didn't make the payments on them.  Character traits Jordan is a self-centered prima donna. For instance, in \"Operation Righteous Cowboy Lightning\", Tracy says, \"Perfection is my middle name. 'Unclaimed Perfection Baby Boy'.\" He aspires to own an island. Jordan is treated for a mental health disorder by Dr. Leo Spaceman, a doctor of questionable integrity and qualification, who describes Tracy's problems as \"erratic tendencies and delusions brought on by excessive notoriety and certainly not helped by my (Spaceman's) highly experimental treatments.\" He is unable to perform a scene the same way twice (\"Future Husband\"), making his employ as an actor difficult. Jordan is also a conspiracy theorist who believes, for instance, in shadow organizations and vampires.  Despite all this, the character is supposed to be generally well-meaning and more intelligent than he appears. He periodically surprises his coworkers with his knowledge of proper grammar (for example, telling Toofer in \"The Aftermath\" that \"Superman does good, you're doing well\") and advanced vocabulary, though these vignettes are often played for comedy. He is able to remember details of American history and is able to answer trivia questions correctly. He also has a sensitivity to the mistreatment of African Americans. Tracy has an interest in American Revolutionary history, which he studied after learning of his relation to Thomas Jefferson, attempting to produce and star in a Jefferson biopic. In \"Corporate Crush\", while struggling to secure funding for his film, he tells Liz \"You're my Alexander Hamilton!\" In \"Winter Madness\" he argues with several Freedom Trail historical reenactors in Boston for misrepresenting the racism of the Founding Fathers and the date of Crispus Attucks' death.  Jordan often implies that his clownish behavior is mostly an act, which he maintains because his childish persona is responsible for his success as an entertainer. This seems to be supported by Jordan's occasional moments of maturity, such as when he behaves professionally for an entire week in \"The Natural Order\" to prove to Liz Lemon that he is capable of acting like an adult. However, he soon reverts to his old personality, admitting he is more comfortable being immature.  Relationships  Family Tracy and his wife Angie have been married since 1991. They like to roleplay, including 'playing rape', when he wears a ski mask. Jordan often walks around his house naked to show his oldest male child \"who got the biggest ding-dong\". With Angie, Tracy has two sons, named Tracy Jordan Jr. and George Foreman Jordan (played by Dante E. Clark), and a daughter, Virginia, who is born during season 5. Tracy also has a self-styled illegitimate son named Donald (played by Michael Benjamin Washington), an entrepreneur whom Tracy supports financially despite knowing that he is not actually his son; Donald is two years older than Tracy.  Although he \"parties with women to keep up his rap credentials,\" Tracy maintains loyalty to his wife, admitting to Jack Donaghy in \"The Ones\" that he has never cheated on her. Because his womanizing persona is integral to his success as an entertainer, Tracy's career takes a downturn in \"Don Geiss, America, and Hope\" when his monogamy becomes known to the public, in a reverse parody of the Tiger Woods infidelity scandal of 2009.  Tracy spent most of his childhood in foster care. He once lived with his birth mother, but lost touch with her: in \"The Moms\" he is not sure of her whereabouts or even her name. Tracy's biological father is unknown; Tracy presumes him dead since he has never come forward to ask Tracy for money. In \"Nothing Left to Lose,\" Tracy shares memories of a father who abandoned him for a second family in Ohio (going on to have a daughter who is also named Tracy), but the effect of this upon the show's continuity is unclear.  With Liz Tracy refers to Liz by either her last name or her full name, for example, \"Too late, Liz Lemon!\" Jordan treats Liz with contempt and mimics her. However, in later seasons he begins calling her \"LL\", following a trend of often calling characters by their initials.  With his entourage and friends Jordan tends to loiter around the studio with his entourage, former high school classmate Grizz and professional entourage member Dot Com.  Jordan develops a close friendship with NBC page Kenneth Parcell, who willingly runs errands for him and periodically serves as a member of his entourage.  Kenneth often puts himself in harm's way to help Jordan.  Jordan helps Kenneth with his shyness around women, and considers himself a mentor to Kenneth.  He is more sympathetic to Kenneth than most of the other characters are.  For example, when Tracy quit TGS after learning he no longer needed the money he earned from the show, it was Jack's threat to fire Kenneth that made Tracy change his mind, returning to the show in order to keep Kenneth employed (\"The Bubble\").  Kenneth acted as an asexual, de facto, on-set wife to Jordan during his brief estrangement from Angie (Season 2).  With Jenna Jordan and Jenna often disagree. For instance, whether it is more difficult to be a black man or a white woman in America (\"Believe in the Stars\"). However, they have some friendly moments at times and become closer, assuming they are both \"special people\".  There is also an increasing occurrence of the two being involved in shenanigans together.  Jordan's life  Career Jordan has a reputation for being uncontrollable and his habit of insulting powerful movie executives costs him roles. However, Jordan's engagements are many and varied.  Politics Jordan is not overly interested in politics. Jack tried to recruit Jordan to join the Republican Party, but Jordan came to realize that African-Americans would never support the GOP. In 2007 Tracy's wife objects to him playing Barack Obama because, \"...we support [Dennis] Kucinich.\" In the 2008 US Presidential Election, Jordan voted for Ralph Nader.  Religion Jordan is not religious. He once considers becoming Catholic, but is dissuaded by Jack due to, as expected, intolerance of guilt. In \"The Ones,\" when Jordan arranges for Jack to come clubbing with him to see if Jack can remain faithful to his fianc\u00e9e Elisa, Jordan compares the temptation to \"Jesus in the wilderness,\" before clarifying that Jesus is the name of a person he knows and \"the Wilderness\" is a club they'd attended. Jordan once wrote a novelty song entitled \"Werewolf Bar Mitzvah\", which he recorded for Geffen Records. The lyrics include \"Werewolf bar mitzvah, spooky, scary! Boys becoming men; men becoming wolves!\" He learns some Hebrew phrases. In the first episode of season 4 (entitled Season Four) of the show, it is revealed that Tracy may as well actually be Jewish. When asked about his disconnection to his roots, he said, \"Have I lost touch with my roots? I've gotta talk to Rabbi Shmuley about this.\"  Finances Despite his personality difficulties, Jordan succeeds financially. For example, he makes $300 million by creating and marketing a pornographic video game, and then invests the profits in a company that dismantles bank signs during the financial crisis.  Death  In Episode 21 of Season Five, it is revealed in an end credit scene that both Jordan and Maroney died on March 17, 2016 of an unknown cause. This has been proven to be false in the events of \"30 Rock: A One-Time Special\" which is set in July 2020 and Tracy and Jenna have both been shown to be alive with the former living in Canada.  Trivia In Tina Fey's original pilot script for 30 Rock, Jordan was called \"Lawrence Jordan\".

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Overland Trail\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Overland Trail (also known as the Overland Stage Line) was a stagecoach and wagon trail in the American West during the 19th century.  While portions of the route had been used by explorers and trappers since the 1820s, the Overland Trail was most heavily used in the 1860s as a route alternative to the Oregon, California, and Mormon trails through central Wyoming.  The Overland Trail was famously used by the Overland Stage Company owned by Ben Holladay to run mail and passengers to Salt Lake City, Utah, via stagecoaches in the early 1860s. Starting from Atchison, Kansas, the trail descended into Colorado before looping back up to southern Wyoming and rejoining the Oregon Trail at Fort Bridger. The stage line operated until 1869 when the completion of the First Transcontinental Railroad eliminated the need for mail service via stagecoach.  History   In 1850, U.S. Army Corps of Topographical Engineers Captain Howard Stansbury's expedition was returning east.  At Fort Bridger, Jim Bridger advised Stansbury of a shorter route than the Oregon Trail.  According to Erb, Brown and Hughes, \"From the Green River this trail went eastward along Bitter Creek, skirting the Red Desert to Muddy Creek, following the Muddy Canyon to Bridger's Pass where the Continental Divide was crossed, then down Sage Creek crossing the North Platte River and dropping down onto the Laramie Plains.\" General William Henry Ashley had crossed the Laramie Plains in 1825, and John C. Fremont had explored the area near Bridger Pass in 1842, while natives had used this and other trails for years, including the Cherokee Trail as recently as 1849.  In 1858, Lieutenant F.T. Bryan made his third expedition over the Bridger Pass route, when a topographical party with engineers determined a roadway that included built bridges, and filled-in gullies.    From 1859, the Leavenworth and Pike's Peak Express operated mail stages from Missouri along the South Pass Oregon-California trail.  The Chorpenning contract was annulled in 1860 and was subsequently awarded to the Central Overland California and Pikes Peak Express Company (C.O.C and P.P Express), which ran stage lines between Missouri and Utah along the Oregon Trail.  In 1860, the C.O.C and P.P Express started the Pony Express , which followed the Oregon and Mormon Trails to Salt Lake City and the Central Nevada Route to Sacramento. The Pony Express only lasted a year before the C.O.C and P.P Express went bankrupt and the assets were sold to Ben Holladay. In 1861, Holladay was awarded the Postal Department contract for overland mail service between the end of the western terminus of the railroad in Missouri and Kansas and Salt Lake City. Service from Utah to California was given to the Overland Mail Company and other stage lines.  Holladay initially operated along the original South Pass route, but changed the route further south to the Bridger Pass route after Shoshone attacks.  This more southerly route would also allow connecting routes to Denver.  In 1862, the new route was reconnoitered, and on 21 July 1862, mail coaches began using it.  According to Erb, Brown and Hughes, \"Stations were located approximately every 10 to 15 miles apart and stocked with the finest horses, mules, tack and coaches. The larger places, called Home Stations, located approximately every 50 miles, where the driver's route ended, were built to accommodate travelers with meals and overnight lodging, and had a telegraph station. The smaller, or swing stations, built on one-quarter to one-half acre plots, just provided fresh teams for the coaches.\"   Holladay retained the mail contract on the route until 1866, when it was sold to Wells Fargo. Stage operations continued until 1869, when the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad made stage service unnecessary.  Over time, increasing emigrant traffic and homesteading in the plains and shifting buffalo herds forced Native American tribes into southern Wyoming and northern Colorado, leading to conflicts on the Overland Trail, especially in the eastern portion along the South Platte River and in the western portion along the Laramie Plains. Attempts to force the Native Americans onto a reservation came to a head during the Colorado War in 1864.  Camp Collins, near present-day Fort Collins, Colorado, and Fort Sanders and Fort Halleck in Wyoming were established to protect travelers against Sioux raids on the trail during the 1860s.  Stagecoach stations and ranches along  of the South Platte River were burned down by an army of Cheyenne, Arapaho, and Sioux in January and early February 1865. (See Battle of Julesburg.)  Route   According to Erb, Brown, and Hughes, \"Holladay's Mail and Stage route extended from Atchison, Kansas to Salt Lake City and California.  As the trail entered the northeast corner of Colorado along the South Platte River at Old Julesburg, it departed from the Oregon-California trail, which continued on north to the North Platte and Ft. Laramie and over South Pass, while the new mail route continued to the west and became known as the Overland Stage and Mail Line, or simply the Overland Trail.\"  Stations along the route, proceeding east to west, included Julesburg, Antelope, Spring Hill, Dennison's, Valley, Kelley's, Beaver Creek, Bijou, Fremont's Orchard, Eagle's Nest, Latham, Laporte, Bonner, Cherokee or Stonewall, Virginia Dale, Willow Springs, Big Laramie, Little Laramie, Cooper Creek, Rock Creek, Medicine Bow, elk Mountain (Fort Halleck), Pass Creek, North Platte, Sage Creek, Pine Grove, Bridger's Pass, Sulphur Springs, Washakie, Duck Lake, Dug Springs, LaClede, Big Pond, Black Buttes, Point of Rocks, Salt Wells, Rock Springs, Green River, Lone Tree, Ham's Forl, Church Buttes, Millerville, and Fort Bridger.  Stations north from Denver to Laporte included Childs or Churches, Boones, St. Vrain, Little Thompson, Big Thompson, and Spring Creek. Stations north from Denver to Latham included Pierson's, Fort Lupton, and Big Bend.  The Walbach cut-off was heavily traveled by emigrants in the 1850s, avoiding the dip down south into Colorado and back north.  It originated near Julesburg and followed Lodgepole Creek, across the Laramie Mountains, and Laramie Plains, before joining the Overland Trail at the Little Laramie Station.  Camp Walbach was located along the trail where it entered the Laramie Mountains.  Remnants  Several modern highways follow the same route as the Overland Trail. Interstate 76 follows the South Platte River to Fort Morgan, Colorado, and U.S. Route 34 goes between Fort Morgan and Greeley.  North of Fort Collins, U.S. Route 287 follows the path of the Overland Trail north to Laramie.  West of Laramie the Overland Trail route was closely followed by the Union Pacific Railroad in 1869 and the Lincoln Highway and Interstate 80 in the 20th century.  Remains of stage stops are scattered throughout Wyoming and northern Colorado including well preserved buildings at Virginia Dale, Colorado and Point of Rocks, Wyoming.  The trail is occasionally marked with markers and historical signs where the trail crosses a highway.  Switchbacks on the route can be clearly seen when on highway 287, just north of the town of Laporte, Colorado, above the present day Forks Lumber company, and portions of the route just east of that spot are well preserved and easily seen (although they are crossing through private property).  Cabins from Camp Collins an army post and stop along the Overland Trail are located at the Heritage Center at the Fort Collins Museum and Discovery Science Center.  Included is the oldest cabin of Fort Collins \"Auntie\" Stone, who provided food to Camp Collins post officers and a small hotel and resting spot for Overland Trail passengers.

It was also known as the Oregon Trail, the California Trail, and the Old Military Trail. The trail began in Missouri and followed the Missouri River west to Fort Kearney, Nebraska. From there, it crossed the Great Plains to South Pass, Wyoming. The trail then split into two branches: the Oregon Trail followed the Columbia River to the Pacific Northwest, and the California Trail followed the Sierra Nevada Mountains to California. The Overland Trail was first used by traders and explorers in the early 19th century. It was later used by settlers who were migrating to the West in search of land, gold, and other opportunities. The trail was also used by the military to transport troops and supplies to the West. The Overland Trail was an important route for the settlement and development of the West. It helped to open up the region to trade and commerce, and it facilitated the spread of settlements and the extension of the United States' political and economic influence. The trail was also a key route for the military, which used it to defend the West and to suppress Native American resistance to westward expansion. The Overland Trail was an arduous and dangerous journey. Many pioneers died from disease, exhaustion, or attacks by Native Americans. The trail was also subject to dangerous weather conditions, such as blizzards and floods. Despite these risks, the Overland Trail was an essential part of the West's history and development.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 25357273}

For several years in the 1990s, Big Boy Records ruled the  hip hop music industry in New Orleans until No Limit Records and Cash Money Records became powerhouse labels.  History Big Boy's first signee was pioneering New Orleans rapper Sporty T (Terence Vine). He had previously been a founding member of The Ninja Crew, New Orleans' first rap group to record. In the early 1990s, inspired by hits by Juvenile and Everlasting Hitman's bounce hits, he moved in that direction as well. The label's first single was \"Sporty Talkin' Sporty.\" Though bounce, it had an uncharacteristically heavy sound for the genre. After it sold 4,000 copies, Big Boy sought out more talent. In that same year Big Boy Signed Partners-N-Crime, a rapping duo from Hollygrove, New Orleans. When they dropped their single \"Let the Good Times Roll\" in 1994 it became an instant hit. Months later their debut album PNC 3 hit the stores. Later on in that year G-Slimm's Fours Deuces & Trays sold 200,000 copies. However, the label's first huge success came from a recently returned Gulf War veteran, Mystikal (Michael Ernest Tyler). The 12th Ward native had originally been with Parkway Pumpin as Mystikal Mike. Then he was poached by Big Boy, who released \"I'm Not That Nigga\" and a self-titled debut which sold 300,000 copies. Apparently bolstered by this considerable windfall, Big Boy made most of their promotional videos in the wake. After Mystikal signed with No Limit and the death of G-Slimm, Big Boy records slowly began to fall apart. In 2004 they released Big Boy Greatest Hits compilation album featuring all the greatest hits from 1992-2000.  In 2015, Charles \"Big Boy\" Temple died.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Calcium channel blocker toxicity\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Calcium channel blocker toxicity is the taking of too much of the medications known as calcium channel blockers (CCBs), either by accident or on purpose. This often causes a slow heart rate and low blood pressure. This can progress to the heart stopping altogether. Some CCBs can also cause a fast heart rate as a result of the low blood pressure. Other symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, sleepiness, and shortness of breath. Symptoms usually occur in the first six hours but with some forms of the medication may not start until 24 after hours.  There are a number of treatments that may be useful. These include efforts to reduce absorption of the drug including: activated charcoal taken by mouth if given shortly after the ingestion or whole bowel irrigation if an extended release formula was taken. Efforts to bring about vomiting are not recommended. Medications to treat the toxic effects include: intravenous fluids, calcium gluconate, glucagon, high dose insulin, vasopressors and lipid emulsion. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may also be an option.  More than ten thousand cases of calcium channel blocker toxicity were reported in the United States in 2010. Along with beta blockers and digoxin calcium channel blockers have one of the highest rates of death in overdose. These medications first became available in the 1970s and 1980s. They are one of the few types of medication in which one pill can result in the death of a child.  Signs and symptoms Most people who have taken too much of a calcium channel blocker, especially diltiazem, get slow heart rate and low blood pressure (vasodilatory shock). This can progress to the heart stopping altogether. CCBs of the dihydropyridine group, as well as flunarizine, predominantly cause reflex tachycardia as a reaction to the low blood pressure.  Other potential symptoms include: nausea and vomiting, a decreased level of consciousness, and breathing difficulties. Symptoms usually begin within 6 hours of taking the medication by mouth. With extended release formulations symptoms may not occur for up to a day. Seizures are rare in adults but in children occur more often. Hypocalcaemia may also occur.  Cause Calcium channel blockers, also known as calcium channel antagonists, are widely used for a number of health conditions. Thus they are commonly present in many people's homes. In young children one pill may cause serious health problems and potentially death. The calcium channel blocker that caused the greatest number of deaths in 2010 in the United States was verapamil. This agent is believed to cause more heart problems than many of the others.  Diagnosis A blood or urine test to diagnose overdose is not generally available. CCB overdose may cause high blood sugar levels, and this is often a sign of how severe the problem will become.  Electrocardiogram CCB toxicity can cause a number of electrocardiogram abnormalities with a low sinus rhythm being the most common. Others include: QT prolongation, bundle branch block, first-degree atrioventricular block, and even sinus tachycardia.  Differential It may not be possible to tell the difference between beta blocker toxicity and calcium channel blocker overdose based on signs and symptoms.  Management The medical management of CCB toxicity may be difficult. It may not improve with the usual treatments used for a low blood pressure and a slow heart rate. In those who have no symptoms or signs six hours following taking an immediate release formulation and 24 hours after taking an extended release formulation need no further medical treatment.  Detoxification Activated charcoal is recommended if it can be given within an hour or two of taking the calcium channel blockers. In those who have taken an extended release formulation of a CCB but are otherwise doing fine, whole bowel irrigation with polyethylene glycol may be useful. Causing vomiting by the use of medications such as ipecac is not recommended.  Insulin High doses of intravenous insulin with glucose may be useful and are a first line treatment in overdoses. As this treatment may cause a drop in blood sugar and blood potassium levels, these should be monitored closely.  Other  Intravenous calcium gluconate or calcium chloride is considered a specific antidotes. Slow heart rate can be treated with atropine and sympathomimetics. Low blood pressure is treated with vasopressors such as adrenaline.  There is tentative clinical evidence and good theoretical evidence of the benefit of lipid emulsion in severe overdoses of CCBs.

This makes it easier for the heart to pump blood. CCBs include drugs such as dihydropyridines (e.g., amlodipine, felodipine, isradipine, lacidipine, lercanidipine, nitrendipine, and verapamil) and non-dihydropyridines (e.g., diltiazem, mibefradil, bepridil, and verapamil). These drugs are used to treat a variety of conditions, including hypertension, angina, and certain types of arrhythmias. CCBs are one of the most widely prescribed classes of drugs. In 2013, it was estimated that 4.5% of the population in the United States were taking CCBs. The most common side effects of CCBs are: * Headaches * Dizziness * Nausea * Constipation * Diarrhea * Feeling tired * Loss of appetite * Weakness * Vertigo * Ataxia * Mental confusion * Depression * Visual disturbances * Hearing disturbances * Tinnitus * Impaired attention * Impaired memory * Impaired judgment * Impaired decision-making * Impaired abstract thinking * Impaired creativity * Impaired imagination * Impaired perception * Impaired coordination * Impaired strength * Impaired endurance * Impaired flexibility * Impaired joint movement * Pain * Bruising * Petechiae * Bleeding * Rash * Itch * Swelling * Breathing difficulties * Fast heartbeat * Slow heartbeat * Irregular heartbeat * Arrest * Myocardial infarction * Angina * Unstable angina * Cardiac arrest * Pericardial effusion * Valve dysfunction * Slow or irregular heartbeat * Vasovagal syndrome * Syncope * Heart failure * Pulmonary edema * Gastrointestinal bleeding * Nasal bleeding * Pneumonia * Nausea and vomiting * Diarrhea * Constipation * Weakness * Dizziness * Headache * Tiredness * Abdominal pain * Back pain * Joint pain * Stiffness * Loss of feeling in arms or legs * Loss of hearing * Loss of taste * Loss of smell * Constipation * Diarrhea * Nausea * Vomiting * Itch * Rash * Hives * Swelling * Fast heartbeat * Slow heartbeat * Irregular heartbeat * Arrest * Myocardial infarction * Angina * Unstable angina * Cardiac arrest * Pericardial effusion * Valve dysfunction * Slow or irregular heartbeat * Vasovagal syndrome * Syncope * Heart failure * Pulmonary edema * Gastrointestinal bleeding * Nasal bleeding * Pneumonia * Nausea and vomiting * Diarrhea * Constipation * Weakness * Dizziness * Headache * Tiredness * Abdominal pain * Back pain * Joint pain * Stiffness * Loss of feeling in arms or legs * Loss of hearing * Loss of taste * Loss of smell * Constipation * Diarrhea * Nausea * Vomiting * Itch * Rash * Hives * Swelling * Fast heartbeat * Slow heartbeat * Irregular heartbeat * Arrest * Myocardial infarction * Angina * Unstable angina * Cardiac arrest * Pericardial effusion * Valve dysfunction * Slow or irregular heartbeat * Vasovagal syndrome * Syncope * Heart failure * Pulmonary edema * Gastrointestinal bleeding * Nasal bleeding * Pneumonia * Nausea and vomiting * Diarrhea * Constipation * Weakness * Dizziness * Headache * Tiredness * Abdominal pain * Back pain * Joint pain * Stiffness * Loss of feeling in arms or legs * Loss of hearing * Loss of taste * Loss of smell * Constipation * Diarrhea * Nausea * Vomiting * Itch * Rash * Hives * Swelling * Fast heartbeat * Slow heartbeat", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 42705237}

He has been a Deputy to the European Parliament (1979-1983), a Deputy to the (French) National Assembly (1986-2007; he was defeated in the 2007 elections, but regained his seat in 2012) and a Government Minister (1983-1986 et 2000-2002). He is a professor at Panth\u00e9on-Assas University. From 1981 to 1983 he was President of the Movement of Radicals of the Left (Mouvement des Radicaux de Gauche, the forerunner of the PRG) in the French Parliament.  He is also known as a popular political theoretician especially in his book L'etat Spectacle originally written in 1977 (Flammarion) and subsequently rewritten to include female political role models (Angela Merkel in particular) in 2009 (Plon) and his other major work La Politique du Mensonge (Odile Jacob 1998).  He posits politics as a shadow show with stereotypical characters and plots.  Main actors include \"The Man of the People\" (Jimmy Carter), \"The Hero\" (Putin), \"Father/Mother of the Nation\" (originally Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and subsequently Angela Merkel) and \"The charmer\" (Blair).  Strategically his analysis is allied to game theory where politicians play roles to contrast with their opponents and provides a tool for analysing electoral tactics.

It is named after Hall of Famer Richie Ashburn, Phillies center fielder from 1948 to 1959, and was also a long time broadcaster for the Phillies from 1963 until his death in September 1997. Ashburn Alley spans from the left field gate to \"The Yard\" kids area, and features a \"street-fair\" like atmosphere before and during a game.  Ashburn Alley's name sake began while Ashburn was still playing. During the Phillies playing days at old Shibe Park, Ashburn was known for dropping bunts down the third baseline, which had slightly overgrown grass that helped the ball stay fair. A bronze statue of Ashburn lies in the center of the alley.  Features  Ashburn Alley serves as a history lesson of baseball in Philadelphia. Granite markers on the walk-way feature every Phillies all-star since the first game in 1933. Another feature of Ashburn Alley is Memory Lane. Memory Lane is located directly behind the batter's eye, and gives an extensive look at the history of Philadelphia baseball. It features the history of the Phillies, the history of Philadelphia Athletics, and history of Negro league teams in the city. At the end of the Memory Lane section offers a great view of the stadiums' two tiered bullpen. The upper bullpen, in particular, pulls snug against the concourse.  On the western end of the Alley is Bull's BBQ, named after former Phillies slugger Greg \"The Bull\" Luzinski, who also operates it. Bull's BBQ is an outdoor picnic section and serves barbecue pork sandwiches, chicken, and most notably ribs. Luzinski is at most of the games and often socializes with fans.  On top of the concession buildings in the center of the Alley is the Rooftop Bleachers. This area of the stadium was influenced by the old rooftop seats at the Phillies and Athletics old home Shibe Park. It was common during the 1920s for residents who lived in the rowhouses across from the ballpark to watch the games for free on their rooftops.  There are many concession stands featuring Philadelphia cuisine staples such as the cheesesteak, at both Tony Luke's and Campo's. The Alley also features the '47 Brand store, which sells classic Phillies apparel, classic pennants and banners, and other items.

Without any strict method or criticism, he expressed preference for the art of the 15th century. He contributed greatly towards recovery of the neglected art of the Middle Ages.  Life Rio was born in Island of Arz, Morbihan, Bretagne.  He was educated at the college of Vannes, where he received his first appointment as instructor, which occupation however proved to be distasteful. He proceeded to Paris, but was temporarily disappointed in his hope of obtaining there a chair of history.  His enthusiastic championship of the liberty of the Greeks attracted the attention of the Government, which appointed him censor of the public press. His refusal of this appointment won him great popularity and the lifelong friendship of Charles Forbes Ren\u00e9 de Montalembert. In 1828 he published his first work, \"Essai sur l'histoire de l'esprit humain dans l'antiquit\u00e9\", which brought him the favour of the minister Auguste de La Ferronays and a secretariate in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This position allowed him (as Montalembert later wrote to him) to become for Christian, what Winckelmann had been for ancient, art.  He spent the greater portion of the period 1830-60 in travels through Italy, Germany, and England. In Munich he became acquainted with the spokesmen of contemporary Catholicism - Sulpiz Boisser\u00e9e, Franz Xaver Baader, Ignaz von D\u00f6llinger, Joseph G\u00f6rres, and Karl Friedrich von Rumohr - and also with Friedrich Schelling. Schelling gave him an insight into the aesthetic ideal; Rumohr directed him to Italy, where the realization of this ideal in art could be seen.  After contact with the Pre-Raphaelites of England, where he lived for three years and married, and especially of Montalembert's encouragement, he visited again, in company with his wife, all the important galleries of Europe, although he had meanwhile become lame and had to drag himself through the museums on crutches.  Works  In 1835 the first volume of his Art chr\u00e9tien appeared under the misleading title, De la po\u00e9sie chr\u00e9tienne - Forme de l'art. This work, which was received with enthusiasm in Germany and Italy, was a complete failure in France. Discouraged, he renounced art study and wrote a history of the persecutions of the English Catholics, a work which was never printed.  Prominent men like Gladstone, Manzoni, and Thiers became interested in his studies, which he published in four volumes under the title \"L'art chr\u00e9tien\" (1861-7). This work is not a history of all Christian art, but of Italian painting from Cimabue to the death of Raphael.  Rio describes the more notable incidents of his life in the two works, Histoire d'un coll\u00e8ge Breton sous l'Empire, la petite chouannerie (1842) and Epilogue \u00e0 l'art chr\u00e9tien (2 vols., 1872). He also published the following works: Shakespeare (1864), in which he claims the dramatist as a Catholic; Michel-Ange et Raphael (1867); L'id\u00e9al antique et l'id\u00e9al chr\u00e9tien (1873).

Background The race was held in Concord, North Carolina at Charlotte Motor Speedway, a  quad-oval paved track. The race was the second to be held at the track during the 1983 Winston Cup Series, with the other being the 1983 World 600. Bruton Smith and Curtis Turner began building the track in 1959, and despite numerous delays, the track was finished in 1960 for the inaugural World 600.  Race report There were 40 drivers on the grid; 39 of them were American while Trevor Boys was the only Canadian. Sterling Marlin would rack up a last-place finish due to an engine failure on lap 53 out of the 334 being raced that day. Richard Petty defeated Darrell Waltrip by 3.1 seconds in front of 118,000 spectators in a time of three hours and thirty-four minutes; making him have 94 more wins than the next driver on the all-time wins list. There were 30 different lead changes and eight caution periods for 35 laps.  Tim Richmond acquired the pole position with a top speed of  in qualifying while the average race speed was . Richmond led 99 laps in the race and finished in fifth-place. The race developed a sudden and chaotic turn of events on lap 184, Darrell Waltrip managed to keep the lead for an entire lap on a field of speedy drivers before being overtaken by Bill Elliott in time for lap 185.  J.D. McDuffie would fail to qualify for this race along with Laurent Rioux (#38), Bosco Lowe, Randy Baker and Travis Tiller.  On the day of the race, 0.11 inches of precipitation were recorded around the speedway.  Following the last caution flag and pit stops of the race, Darrell Waltrip, driving Junior Johnson's #11 Chevy led the race over Tim Richmond in the #27 Raymond Beadle Pontiac after the restart with 23 laps to go. Richard Petty was in third place. With less than ten laps to go Waltrip's car noticeably slowed and appeared to wiggle slightly exiting turn two and allowed Petty to duck below for the lead and race win. Cale Yarborough in the #28 Ranier Racing Chevy was two laps down and also passed Waltrip and was on Petty's rear bumper when the checkered flag fell. The race highlights are available to view on YouTube. No direct link is allowed.  During victory lane celebrations a NASCAR official noticed that Petty's race car had left side tires mounted on the right side of the car, which was a violation of the rules. NASCAR sent Petty's Pontiac into the enclosed Union 76 garage inspection area for a complete engine teardown and detailed inspection.  After a four-hour inspection of the Petty Enterprises race car, NASCAR determined the engine in Petty's car was over the limit in cubic inches as specified in the rule book. The Petty team was penalized 104 points and fined $35,000 for the rule violations involving the tires and engine. The engine was determined to be , well over the specifications in the NASCAR rulebook for 1983 which stipulated a maximum of .  Petty co-crew chiefs, Robin Pemberton and Larry Pollard, stated that during the last pit stop of the race they put softer compound bias-ply tires designed for the left side of the cars on the right side of Petty's race car. The softer left side tires provided more traction when attached to the right side of a stock car and worked best when used during cool cloudy weather days which prevents the softer tires from quickly wearing out if mounted on the right side of the cars.  NASCAR allowed the win to stand because the second place car of Waltrip was quickly removed from the track in the team hauler rig after the race ended and could not be inspected to determine if it was legal or not. NASCAR stated that they wanted fans to leave the track knowing who won the race.  Ironically, ten years earlier at this race the winning Chevy of Cale Yarborough (owned by Junior Johnson) and Richard Petty's second place Dodge were both submitted to long inspections after the race for allegedly having oversized engines. NASCAR admitted in the days after the 1973 race controversy that their pre-race inspection system needed to be improved.  This was the 198th race win in Petty's career.  The total amount of prize money offered to all NASCAR Winston Cup Series drivers for this race was a then-incredible $352,430. and was one of the top paying races of the 1983 season.

The film stars Rasika Dugal, Vikas Kumar and Talha Arshad Reshi in major roles, and is an adaptation of the play Phone No. 786 by Mohd. Amin Bhat. The story revolves about a seven-year-old Hamid who learns that 786 is God's number and decides to try and reach out to God, by dialing this number. He wants to talk to his father, who his classmate tells him has gone to Allah. One fine day the phone call is answered, and two lives shattered in the strife of Kashmir find a way to be complete again. The film is produced by Yoodlee Films, a venture of Saregama. The official trailer was released on 10 October 2018. Global premiere of Hamid was held at the Jio MAMI 20th Mumbai Film Festival. The film went on to win the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Urdu at the 66th National Film Awards hosted in August 2019.  Plot   Hamid is a young boy of seven, in search of his father who went missing a year ago. He somehow discovers that 786 is Allah's number, makes some combination and finally dials a phone number which is answered. Thus begins a series of conversations with the person on the other line who happens to be a CRPF soldier finding solace in Hamid's innocent talk. Hamid tells him about his father, his teachings and how his absence has changed their lives. Meanwhile, Hamid's mother is not able to make peace with the fact that her husband has disappeared. She is always lost in her grief and is dejected.  Hamid tries to learn his father's boat-making craft among various other means to please Allah, in belief that his father might return some day. Finally on one of the days Hamid realizes that his father is dead and would never return. His mother comes to terms with his death on the very same day. In the epilogue it is shown that Hamid finally gets his much desired red paint for the newly deigned boat (probably sent by the CRPF jawan), paints it and sails on it with his mother.  The film denotes how eventually people learn to deal with tragedies and move on no matter what, and serves as a powerful depiction of human resilience. What is striking is also the fact that despite being naive the boy knows the difference between what is right and what is wrong due to his father's teachings, again stressing the fact that we are a result of our upbringing.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Battle of Yongsan\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Battle of Yongsan was an engagement between United Nations Command (UN) and North Korean forces early in the Korean War from September 1\u20135, 1950, at Yongsan in South Korea. It was part of the Battle of Pusan Perimeter and was one of several large engagements fought simultaneously. The battle ended in a victory for the UN after large numbers of United States Army (US) repelled a strong Korean People's Army (KPA) attack.  During the nearby Second Battle of Naktong Bulge, the KPA broke through the US 2nd Infantry Division lines along the Naktong River. Exploiting this weakness, the KPA 9th and 4th Divisions attacked to Yongsan, a village east of the river and the gateway to the UN lines of supply and reinforcement for the Pusan Perimeter. What followed was a fight between KPA and US forces for Yongsan.  The KPA were able to briefly capture Yongsan from the 2nd Infantry Division, which had been split in half from the penetrations at Naktong Bulge. Lieutenant General Walton Walker, seeing the danger of the attack, brought in the US Marine Corps 1st Provisional Marine Brigade to counterattack. In three days of fierce fighting, the Army and Marine forces were able to push the KPA out of the town and destroy the two attacking divisions. The win was a key step toward victory in the fight at the Naktong Bulge.  Background  Pusan Perimeter   From the outbreak of the Korean War and the invasion of South Korea by the North, the KPA had enjoyed superiority in both manpower and equipment over both the Republic of Korea Army (ROK) and the UN forces dispatched to South Korea to prevent it from collapsing. The KPA tactics were to aggressively pursue UN forces on all avenues of approach south and to engage them aggressively, attacking from the front and initiating a double envelopment of both flanks of the unit, which allowed the KPA to surround and cut off the opposing force, which would then be forced to retreat in disarray, often leaving behind much of its equipment. From their initial June 25 offensive to fights in July and early August, the KPA used these tactics to effectively defeat any UN force and push it south. However, when the UN forces, under the Eighth United States Army, established the Pusan Perimeter in August, the UN troops held a continuous line along the peninsula which KPA troops could not flank, and their advantages in numbers decreased daily as the superior UN logistical system brought in more troops and supplies to the UN forces.  When the KPA approached the Pusan Perimeter on August 5, they attempted the same frontal assault technique on the four main avenues of approach into the perimeter. Throughout August, the KPA 6th Division, and later the KPA 7th Division, engaged the US 25th Infantry Division at the Battle of Masan, initially repelling a UN counteroffensive before countering with battles at Komam-ni and Battle Mountain. These attacks stalled as UN forces, well equipped and with plenty of reserves, repeatedly repelled KPA attacks. North of Masan, the KPA 4th Division and the US 24th Infantry Division sparred in the Naktong Bulge area. In the First Battle of Naktong Bulge, the KPA division was unable to hold its bridgehead across the river as large numbers of US reserve forces were brought in to repel it, and on August 19, the KPA 4th Division was forced back across the river with 50 percent casualties. In the Taegu region, five KPA divisions were repulsed by three UN divisions in several attempts to attack the city during the Battle of Taegu. Particularly heavy fighting took place at the Battle of the Bowling Alley where the KPA 13th Division was almost completely destroyed in the attack. On the east coast, three more KPA divisions were repulsed by the ROK at P'ohang-dong during the Battle of P'ohang-dong. All along the front, the KPA troops were reeling from these defeats, the first time in the war their tactics were not working.  September push   In planning its new offensive, the KPA command decided any attempt to flank the UN force was impossible thanks to the support of the UN naval forces. Instead, they opted to use frontal attack to breach the perimeter and collapse it; this was considered to be the only hope of achieving success in the battle. Fed by intelligence from the Soviet Union, the North Koreans were aware of the UN forces building up along the Pusan Perimeter and that they must conduct an offensive soon or they could not win the battle. A secondary objective was to surround Taegu and destroy the UN units in that city. As part of this mission, the KPA would first cut the supply lines to Taegu.  On August 20, the KPA commands distributed operations orders to their subordinate units. The plan called for a simultaneous five-prong attack against the UN lines. These attacks would overwhelm the UN defenders and allow the KPA to break through the lines in at least one place to force the UN forces back. Five battle groupings were ordered. The center attack called for the KPA 9th, 4th, 2nd and 10th Divisions to break through the US 2nd Infantry Division at the Naktong Bulge to Miryang and Yongsan.  Battle   On the morning of September 1 the 1st and 2nd Regiments of the KPA 9th Division, in their first offensive of the war, stood only a few miles short of Yongsan after a successful river crossing and penetration of the US line. The 3rd Regiment had been left at Inch'on, but division commander Major General Pak Kyo Sam felt the chances of capturing Yongsan were strong.  As the KPA 9th Division approached Yongsan, its 1st Regiment was on the north and its 2nd Regiment on the south. The division's attached support, consisting of one 76\u00a0mm artillery battalion from the KPA I Corps, an anti-aircraft battalion of artillery, two tank battalions of the KPA 16th Armored Brigade, and a battalion of artillery from the 4th Division, gave it unusually heavy support. Crossing the river behind it came the 4th Division, a greatly weakened organization, far understrength, short of weapons, and made up mostly of untrained replacements. A captured KPA document referred to this grouping of units that attacked from the Sinban-ni area into the Naktong Bulge as the main force of KPA I Corps. Elements of the 9th Division reached the hills just west of Yongsan during the afternoon of September 1.  On the morning of September 1, with only the shattered remnants of E Company at hand, the US 9th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division had virtually no troops to defend Yongsan. Division commander Major General Laurence B. Keiser in this emergency attached the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion to the regiment. The US 72nd Tank Battalion and the 2nd Division Reconnaissance Company also were assigned positions close to Yongsan. The regimental commander planned to place the engineers on the chain of low hills that arched around Yongsan on the northwest.  North Korean attack  A Company, 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion, moved to the south side of the Yongsan-Naktong River road; D Company of the 2nd Engineer Battalion was on the north side of the road. Approximately  west of Yongsan an estimated 300 KPA troops engaged A Company in a fire fight. M19 Gun Motor Carriages of the 82nd AAA Battalion supported the engineers in this action, which lasted several hours. Meanwhile, with the approval of the Assistant Division Commander Brigadier General Joseph S. Bradley, D Company moved to the hill immediately south of and overlooking Yongsan. A platoon of infantry went into position behind it. A Company was now ordered to fall back to the southeast edge of Yongsan on the left flank of D Company. There, A Company went into position along the road; on its left was C Company of the Engineer battalion, and beyond C Company was the 2nd Division Reconnaissance Company. The hill occupied by D Company was in reality the western tip of a large mountain mass that lay southeast of the town. The road to Miryang came south out of Yongsan, bent around the western tip of this mountain, and then ran eastward along its southern base. In its position, D Company not only commanded the town but also its exit, the road to Miryang.  The KPA had also approached Yongsan from the south. The US 2nd Division Reconnaissance Company and tanks of the 72nd Tank Battalion opposed them in an intense fight. In this action, Sergeant First Class Charles W. Turner of the Reconnaissance Company particularly distinguished himself. He mounted a tank, operated its exposed turret machine gun, and directed tank fire which reportedly destroyed seven KPA machine guns. Turner and this tank came under heavy KPA fire which shot away the tank's periscope and antennae and scored more than 50 hits on it. Turner, although wounded, remained on the tank until he was killed. That night KPA soldiers crossed the low ground around Yongsan and entered the town from the south.  The KPA now attempted a breakthrough of the Engineer position. After daylight, they were unable to get reinforcements into the fight since D Company commanded the town and its approaches. In this fight, which raged until 11:00, the engineers had neither artillery nor mortar support. D Company remedied this by using its new 3.5-inch and old 2.36-inch rocket launchers (Bazookas) against the KPA infantry. The fire of the 18 Bazookas plus that from machine guns and the small arms of the company inflicted very heavy casualties on the KPA, who desperately tried to clear the way for a push eastward to Miryang. Tanks of A and B Companies, 72nd Tank Battalion, at the southern and eastern edge of Yongsan shared equally with the engineers in the intensity of this battle. The company commander was the only officer of D Company not killed or wounded in this melee, which cost the company 12 men killed and 18 wounded. The edge of Yongsan and the slopes of the hill south of the town became covered with KPA dead and destroyed equipment.  Reinforcements  While this battle raged during the morning at Yongsan, commanders reorganized about 800 men of the 9th Infantry who had arrived in that vicinity from the overrun river line positions. Among them were F and G Companies, which were not in the path of major KPA crossings and had succeeded in withdrawing eastward. They had no crew-served weapons or heavy equipment. In midafternoon September 2, tanks and the reorganized US 2nd Battalion, 9th Infantry, attacked through A Company, 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion, into Yongsan, and regained possession of the town at 15:00.  Later, two Bazooka teams from A Company, 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion, knocked out three T-34 tanks just west of Yongsan. US ground and air action destroyed other KPA tanks during the day southwest of the town. By evening the KPA had been driven into the hills westward. In the evening, the 2nd Battalion and A Company, 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion, occupied the first chain of low hills  beyond Yongsan, the engineers west and the 2nd Battalion northwest of the town. For the time being at least, the KPA drive toward Miryang had been halted. In this time, the desperately undermanned US units began to be reinforced with Korean Augmentees (KATUSAs) However, the cultural divide between the KATUSAs and the US troops caused tensions.  At 09:35 September 2, while the KPA were attempting to destroy the engineer troops at the southern edge of Yongsan and clear the road to Miryang, Eighth United States Army commander Lieutenant General Walton Walker spoke by telephone with Major General Doyle O. Hickey, Deputy Chief of Staff, Far East Command in Tokyo. He described the situation around the Perimeter and said the most serious threat was along the boundary between the US 2nd and 25th Infantry Divisions. He described the location of his reserve forces and his plans for using them. He said he had started the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade, under Brigadier General Edward A. Craig, toward Yongsan but had not yet released them for commitment there and he wanted to be sure that UN commander General of the Army Douglas MacArthur approved his use of them, since he knew that this would interfere with other plans of the Far East Command. Walker said he did not think he could restore the 2nd Division lines without using them. Hickey replied that MacArthur had the day before approved the use of the Marines if and when Walker considered it necessary. A few hours after this conversation, at 13:15, Walker attached the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade to the US 2nd Division and ordered a co-ordinated attack by all available elements of the division and the Marines, with the mission of destroying the KPA east of the Naktong River in the 2nd Division sector and restoring the river line. The Marines were to be released from 2nd Division control as soon as this mission was accomplished.  September 3 counterattack   A conference was held that afternoon at the US 2nd Division command post attended by leaders of the Eighth Army, US 2nd Division, and 1st Marine Brigade. A decision was reached that the Marines would attack west at 08:00 on September 3 astride the Yongsan-Naktong River road;  the 9th Infantry, B Company of the 72nd Tank Battalion, and D Battery of the 82d AAA Battalion would attack northwest above the marines and attempt to re-establish contact with the US 23rd Infantry Regiment; the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion, remnants of the 1st Battalion, 9th Infantry and elements of the 72nd Tank Battalion would attack on the left flank, or south, of the Marines to reestablish contact with the 25th Division. Eighth Army now ordered the US 24th Infantry Division headquarters and the US 19th Infantry Regiment to move to the Susan-ni area,  south of Miryang and  east of the confluence of the Nam River and the Naktong River. There it was to prepare to enter the battle in either the 2nd or 25th Division zone.  The troops holding this line on the first hills west of Yongsan were G Company, 9th Infantry, north of the road running west through Kogan-ni to the Naktong; A Company, 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion, southward across the road; and, below the engineers, F Company, 9th Infantry. Between 03:00 and 04:30 September 3, the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade moved to forward assembly areas. The 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines assembled north of Yongsan, the 1st Battalion, 5th Marines south of it. The 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines established security positions southwest of Yongsan along the approaches into the regimental sector from that direction.  During the night, A Company of the engineers had considerable fighting with KPA and never reached its objective. At dawn September 3, A Company attacked to gain the high ground which was part of the designated Marine line of departure. The company fought its way up the slope to within  of the top, which was held by the firmly entrenched KPA. At this point the company commander caught a KPA-thrown grenade and was wounded by its fragments as he tried to throw it away from his men. The company with help from Marine tank fire eventually gained its objective, but this early morning battle for the line of departure delayed the planned attack.  The Marine attack started at 08:55 across the rice paddy land toward KPA-held high ground  westward. The 1st Battalion, 5th Marines, south of the east\u2013west road, gained its objective when KPA soldiers broke under air attack and ran down the northern slope and crossed the road to Hill 116 in the 2nd Battalion zone. Air strikes, artillery concentrations, and machine gun and rifle fire of the 1st Battalion now caught KPA reinforcements in open rice paddies moving up from the second ridge and killed most of them. In the afternoon, the 1st Battalion advanced to Hill 91.  North of the road the 2nd Battalion had a harder time, encountering heavy KPA fire when it reached the northern tip of Hill 116,  west of Yongsan. The KPA held the hill during the day, and at night D Company of the 5th Marines was isolated there. In the fighting west of Yongsan Marine armor knocked out four T-34 tanks, and KPA crew members abandoned a fifth. That night the Marines dug in on a line  west of Yongsan. The 2nd Battalion had lost 18 killed and 77 wounded during the day, most of them in D Company. Total Marine casualties for September 3 were 34 killed and 157 wounded. Coordinating its attack with that of the marines, the 9th Infantry advanced abreast of them on the north.  September 4 counterattack  Just before midnight, the 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines, received orders to pass through the 2nd Battalion and continue the attack in the morning.  That night torrential rains made the troops miserable and lowered morale. The KPA were unusually quiet and launched few patrols or attacks. The morning of September 4, the weather was clear.  The counterattack continued at 08:00 September 4, at first against little opposition. North of the road the 2nd Battalion quickly completed occupation of Hill 116, from which the KPA had withdrawn during the night. South of the road the 1st Battalion occupied what appeared to be a command post of the KPA 9th Division. Tents were still up and equipment lay scattered about. Two abandoned T-34 tanks in excellent condition stood there. Tanks and ground troops advancing along the road found it littered with KPA dead and destroyed and abandoned equipment. By nightfall the counterattack had gained another .  That night was quiet until just before dawn. The KPA then launched an attack against the 9th Infantry on the right of the Marines, the heaviest blow striking G Company. It had begun to rain again and the attack came in the midst of a downpour. In bringing his platoon from an outpost position to the relief of the company, Sergeant First Class Loren R. Kaufman encountered an encircling KPA force on the ridge line. He bayoneted the lead scout and engaged those following with grenades and rifle fire. His sudden attack confused and dispersed this group. Kaufman led his platoon on and succeeded in joining hard-pressed G Company. In the ensuing action Kaufman led assaults against close-up KPA positions and, in hand-to-hand fighting, he bayoneted four more KPA soldiers, destroyed a machine gun position, and killed a mortar crew. US artillery fire concentrated in front of the 9th Infantry helped greatly in repelling the KPA in this night and day battle.  September 5 counterattack  That morning, September 5, after a 10-minute artillery preparation, the American troops moved out in their third day of counterattack. It was a day of rain. As the attack progressed, the marines approached Obong-ni Ridge and the 9th Infantry neared Cloverleaf Hill where they had fought tenaciously during the First Battle of Naktong Bulge the month before. There, at midmorning, on the high ground ahead, they could see KPA troops digging in. The Marines approached the pass between the two hills and took positions in front of the KPA-held high ground.  At 14:30 approximately 300 KPA infantry came from the village of Tugok and concealed positions, striking B Company on Hill 125 just north of the road and east of Tugok. Two T-34 tanks surprised and knocked out the two leading Marine M26 Pershing tanks. Since the destroyed Pershing tanks blocked fields of fire, four others withdrew to better positions. Assault teams of B Company and the 1st Battalion with 3.5-inch Bazookas rushed into action, took the tanks under fire, and destroyed both of them, as well as an armored personnel carrier following behind. The KPA infantry attack was brutal and inflicted 25 casualties on B Company before reinforcements from A Company and supporting Army artillery and Marine 81\u00a0mm mortars helped repel it.  September 5 was a day of heavy casualties everywhere on the Pusan Perimeter. Army units had 102 killed, 430 wounded, and 587 missing in action for a total of 1,119 casualties. Marine units had 35 killed, 91 wounded, for a total of 126 battle casualties. Total American battle casualties for the day were 1,245 men. It is unknown how many KPA were killed or wounded on that day, but they likely suffered heavy casualties.  North Koreans repulsed  During the previous night, at 20:00 September 4, General Walker had ordered the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade released from operational control of the 2nd Division effective at midnight, September 5. He had vainly protested against releasing the brigade, believing he needed it and all the troops then in Korea if he were to stop the KPA offensive against the Pusan Perimeter. At 00:15, September 6, the Marines began leaving their lines at Obong-ni Ridge and headed for Pusan. They would join the 1st Marine Regiment and 7th Marine Regiment in forming the new 1st Marine Division. This was done after a heated disagreement between Walker's command and MacArthur's command. Walker said he could not hold the Pusan Perimeter without the Marines in reserve, while MacArthur said he could not conduct the Inchon landings without the Marines. MacArthur responded by assigning the US 17th Infantry Regiment and later the US 65th Infantry Regiment to Walker's reserves, but Walker did not feel the inexperienced troops would be effective. Walker felt the transition endangered the Perimeter at a time when it was unclear if it would hold.  The American counteroffensive of September 3\u20135 west of Yongsan, according to prisoner statements, resulted in one of the bloodiest debacles of the war for a KPA division. Even though remnants of the KPA 9th Division, supported by the low strength KPA 4th Division, still held Obong-ni Ridge, Cloverleaf Hill, and the intervening ground back to the Naktong on September 6, the division's offensive strength had been spent at the end of the American counterattack. The KPA 9th and 4th divisions were not able to resume the offensive.  Aftermath  The KPA 4th and 9th Divisions were almost completely destroyed in the battles at Naktong Bulge. The 9th Division had numbered 9,350 men at the beginning of the offensive on September 1. The 4th Division numbered 5,500. Only a few hundred from each division returned to North Korea after the Second Battle of Naktong Bulge. The majority of the KPA troops had been killed, captured or deserted. The exact number of KPA casualties at Yongsan is impossible to determine, but a substantial amount of the attacking force was lost there. All of KPA II Corps was in a similar state, and the KPA, exhausted at Pusan Perimeter and cut off after Inchon, was on the brink of defeat.  The US casualty count at Yongsan is also difficult to know, as the division's scattered units were engaged all along the Naktong Bulge without communication and total casualty counts in each area could not be ascertained. The US 2nd Infantry Division suffered 1,120 killed, 2,563 wounded, 67 captured and 69 missing during its time at the Second Battle of Naktong Bulge. This included about 180 casualties it suffered during the First Battle of Naktong Bulge the previous month. American forces were continually repulsed but able to prevent the KPA from breaking the Pusan Perimeter. The division had numbered 17,498 on September 1, but was in excellent position to attack despite its casualties. The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade suffered 185 killed and around 500 wounded during the Battle of Pusan Perimeter, most of which probably occurred at Yongsan.  Once again the fatal weakness of the KPA had cost it victory after an impressive initial success-its communications and supply were not capable of exploiting a breakthrough and of supporting a continuing attack in the face of massive air, armor, and artillery fire that could be concentrated against its troops at critical points. By September 8, the KPA attacks in the area had been repulsed.

History The men's basketball teams first played each other in 1920. Through January 2019, the men's basketball teams have played 200 times, with the Hope Flying Dutchmen leading with 103 wins to the Calvin Knights' 97 wins. The rivalry, which originates from the historical separation of the Reformed Church in America and the Christian Reformed Church in North America, operates on a basis of more similarity than difference. Tom Davelaar, assistant coach to Hope's basketball team, once said, \"... both schools and fan bases are so alike - and yet we think we're different somehow. We're really just two peas in a pod.\" The next face off in 2020 will mark the 100th anniversary since the rivalry started.   In 2009, the rivalry turned ugly - the two teams faced off against each other in the MIAA championship when a Hope student was instigating fans in the upper concourse late in the 2nd half at VanNoord Arena celebrating what would become a Hope victory, when the Hope student kicked a Calvin students legs and a scuffle occurred.  In 2015, it again turned ugly as Calvin students stormed the court in a nail-biter victory and Hope players laid in the middle of the floor and refused to move, nearly getting trampled by the court storming.  This caused an incident between the coaches of the two schools as they became elevated, with Coach Mitchell of Hope eventually admitting defeat.  Significance In 2005, ESPN polled its staff about who they thought were America's greatest college basketball rivalries, and the Calvin\u2013Hope rivalry was voted fourth in all college basketball behind Carolina\u2013Duke rivalry, Connecticut\u2013Tennessee women's basketball rivalry, and Kentucky\u2013Louisville rivalry. ESPN also conducted an on-line \"fan poll\" in which 80% of voters picked the Knights vs. Flying Dutchmen.  The rivalry between the two colleges is most prominent in basketball; however, the rivalry spans the schools' athletics.

The two teams have faced each other twice every year since 1960. Calvin College and Hope College are both located in Michigan, approximately 35 miles (56 km) apart. The schools are both private, four-year institutions with similar student enrollments (Calvin: 3,400; Hope: 3,200) and religious roots. The schools are also both members of the Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association, and the two men's basketball teams have been the MIAA's most successful programs since the turn of the millennium. The rivalry has been characterized by intense competition, close games, and a friendly rivalry between the two schools off the court. The rivalry was listed by Sports Illustrated as one of the 20 biggest rivalries in college basketball. In 2002, the teams combined to sell out every regular-season game at both schools' arenas. The two teams have won a combined 19 MIAA regular-season titles since 1996, including 15 by Calvin. The Knights have won the MIAA Tournament 14 times since 1996, while the Flying Dutch have won it six times.

The film is about an old street musician (played by Sellers) who strikes up a friendship with two children - Liz, played by Donna Mullane, and her younger brother Mark, played by John Chaffey. Neither of the child actors was featured in future films. A young Keith Chegwin also played a small role.  Mullane was recruited for her role by the film crew when they were scouting locations and saw her as she was walking home from school  Plot  The story revolves around Sam, a dignified, former music hall artist who now works with his elderly trained dog Bella, busking in the West End of London. He lives in a run down goods yard alongside a derelict canal in Nine Elms. Two young children, Liz and Mark, stumble upon his yard whilst out walking. He chases them away, but his manner attracts their attention and, despite his best efforts, they later follow him as he goes off to work pushing his dog and all his busking paraphernalia in an Edwardian pram. Liz and Mark live nearby with their parents, Chrissie and Bob, and baby brother James in a drab, cramped basement flat. Bob works at the local gasworks and the family are desperate to move to a new Council flat. When they're out of school, their mother has little time for Liz and Mark and they find their own adventures together on the streets.  Begrudgingly, Sam develops a relationship with the children as they tag along. Having mentioned it in passing, he agrees to take them to visit the Hyde Park pet cemetery, where he anticipates Bella will be buried someday after an elaborate funeral, the next day on his way to the West End. They also discuss visiting the new flats. During the following day, it becomes clear that Bella is increasingly frail and Sam is worried about her. At the new flats, he tells them how his wife died ten years previously and how his seven grown up children are now scattered all over the world. He has found human beings unreliable throughout his life and \u201conly dogs can be depended upon\u201d. Bella is his best friend and, although getting a new flat was all very well, getting a dog was more important. Between them, they conclude the family needs a dog and, having established the children would look after it properly, Sam agrees to help them get one.  The following afternoon, he takes them to Battersea Dogs Home where, posing as their grandfather, he helps them choose a dog. However, Sam is astounded and angry when the home tell him they can only take the dog if it is paid for.  The children and Sam leave the home bitterly disappointed and, having admonished the children for telling lies as \u201che wasn\u2019t their grandfather\u201d, Sam tells them they will have to ask their mum and dad for the money and leaves, humiliated. The children return home despondent and are further discouraged when their mum seems unsympathetic to the idea of getting a dog. The children resolve to try to save the money to get it anyway and make money doing odd jobs. When they next see Sam, he is crotchety, and Bella is very ill. Sam offers to pay them to baby-sit Bella while he is working and having haggled about the fee, they agree.  The following day they resolve to visit their dad at work to see if he will give them the balance to pay for their dog, but he tells them he needs to save everything he can if he is to have a hope of getting the flat. They return to Sam who, reluctant to concede that Bella's condition is terminal, agrees to give them the balance they need as an advance for more baby-sitting duties. Next day, they learn they have got the new flat and, together with Sam, collect their dog which they name Battersea. They return home later to be told they should not have bought the dog. They discover that the new flat is in Nine Elms, not the flats they had seen with Sam in Westminster, and that dogs are not allowed. The children run off to Sam's, where they find Sam drunk and in mourning for Bella. They try to give Battersea to Sam, but he rejects it and, when they talk of the majestic funeral for Bella, he laughs and tells them she will go in the dustcart. He leaves and, after tying Battersea to his table, the children take Bella's body, and at night sneak into the cemetery at Hyde Park and bury it there. They hide when their dad and Sam arrive outside the cemetery with Battersea, but fall asleep as the two talk into the night about life, death, dogs and children. When they awake the following morning Dad is overjoyed to see them and they leave Battersea with Sam.

Both films were set to cockney music hall songs, lending a clear continuity between the works.  Buster Keaton was to have played the lead role of Sam, however British financiers were not convinced of Keaton's box office potential and the project collapsed. The novel was first published in 1964.  Critical reception Variety wrote, \"It all sounds like goo, and the film\u2019s last half-hour verges perilously close. But even at its worst The Optimists is acceptable family fare, and for much of its first 80 minutes it engagingly achieves a sense of fantasy.\" while The New York Times described the film as \"the sort of old-fashioned excursion into sentiment that ought to warm the hearts of parents in search of that elusive piece of merchandise that goes under the name of good family entertainment. Peter Sellers, with a wardrobe of old music hall clothes, a talented but aged dog named Bella and a pram he pushes around London, plays the lonely, idiosyncratic old busker.

The term was coined by the American boxer and manager Jack \"Kid\" Berg, who trained at the noted Jewish Lads' Club in the area.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Best of Hilary Duff\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Best of Hilary Duff is the first greatest hits album by American recording artist Hilary Duff. It was released on November 11, 2008, by Hollywood Records. The 12-track album consists of eight of Duff's previous singles, as well as two new recordings: \"Reach Out\" and \"Holiday\", and two remixes to the songs. Only one single was released from the album, the Ryan \"Alias\" Tedder-produced \"Reach Out\", which became her third single to chart at number one on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play.  Background Duff confirmed that she had collaborated with a rapper called Prophet on a previously unheard song on the Dignity tour's set list, \"Reach Out\" in September 2007. In an interview with remix producer Joe Bermudez in November 2007, she said that Dignity would be re-released in a CDVU+ edition featuring remixes of the original songs alongside two new tracks: \"Reach Out\" and \"Holiday\". Duff said she hoped to write a third new song for the re-release, and to have \"Holiday\" released as its first or second single;  However, Hollywood Records scrapped the plans, adding to their large list of cancelations, which in turn led Duff to make the decision to leave the label and develop Best of Hilary Duff to quickly end her contract, which had expected one more album.  Unlike Duff's first compilation album Most Wanted (2005), which was advertised as strictly a compilation, Best of was strictly advertised as a greatest hits, making it her first.  Critical reception  Best of Hilary Duff received mostly mixed reviews from critics. Allmusic gave the album a positive review stating that Best of Hilary Duff \"is a flipside of her 2005's Most Wanted\", which was \"pitched squarely at bright, happy tweens\". They also went on to say the album \"is not a look back at the past but a blueprint for the future\". Allmusic gave the album a 3.5/5 star rating. Commonsensemedia said that \"parents need to know that Miss Duff has turned up the heat with sexually provocative lyrics that may be too hot to handle for younger fans. Hilary Duff isn't for tweens anymore. The hit single \"Reach Out\" features more aggressive sexual lyrics than on previous albums. While Dignity was OK for 11-year-olds, the Best Of compilation pushes the target age higher. The funky remixes and danceable electronic beats are fun and catchy, but the sexed-up lyrics and themes aren't intended for younger fans.\" Rachel Devitt of Rhapsody said the collection \"is largely pleasant, nicely polished and, rather surprisingly, sleek and even a little edgy. Turns out Lizzie McGuire is a dancefloor diva, and even with that feathery little voice, she manages to work it on tracks like the dark \"Stranger,\" saucy new tune \"Reach Out\" and a clubby remix of \"Dignity.\"  Commercial performance On November 29, 2008, Best of Hilary Duff debuted at number 125 on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 5,500 copies in its first week of release in the US, making it her least successful album to date. Many people believe this was due to a lack of promotion from her record label at the time Hollywood Records and her change in sound of music which many believe resulted in Duff losing some of her younger fans. This is her first album not to receive any RIAA certifications. As of September 2012, the album has sold over 35,000 copies in the United States alone.  Singles \"Reach Out\" was released as the only single from the album. The music video is directed by Philip Andelman and five official versions were released (though some have leaked first).

Jeffries was born in 1819 in Brompton, Kent, England.  During the 1870s, she ran one of the few brothels in Victorian-era London which catered exclusively to many of the city's elite including the prominent businessmen and politicians including at least one member of the House of Lords and a titled Guards officer as well as aristocrats such as Leopold II. She was also involved in sexual slavery (known then as \"white slavery\") and child prostitution, often arranging the abduction of children by offering to watch children while parents went to collect luggage or purchase train tickets.  Among her brothels in Church Street and Kensington as well as a flagellation house in Hampstead, included a \"chamber of horrors\" in Gray's Inn Road where a room was designed for the purposes of sado-masochism as described by journalist William Thomas Stead in a series of articles for the Pall Mall Gazette exposing prostitution in the city during the Eliza Armstrong case. Although never proven, she may have operated a white slave house along the river near Kew, from which women were abducted and smuggled to foreign countries (see Sexual slavery and Human trafficking).  In 1884, the Alfred Dyer's London Committee obtained evidence of a high class Chelsea brothel operated by Jeffries. An investigation by a former police inspector, who had resigned from the Metropolitan Police when senior officials refused to prosecute her, had been amassing evidence against Jeffries during the year until the London Commission began a private prosecution in March 1885.  Although unable to charge Jeffries with any serious offence apart from keeping a disorderly house, the Commission expected much publicity from the case when presenting their evidence. For example, a former housemaid testified that she witnessed an assault on a 13-year-old girl who had been whipped by a belt and raped by a customer.  Appearing in court on May 5, accompanied by several wealthy army officers, Jeffries paid a fine of \u00a3200 after arranging with the court to plead guilty in order to have the evidence against her remain undisclosed. As she left the courthouse, a guard of honour was formed around her by her young escorts.

The wood, which grows close down to the sea-shore, is a noble object from the house, and presents an agreeable retreat from the heat of summer.  History It stands on the site of a house which was formerly occupied by a notorious smuggler named Boyce (d. 1740), who for a long series of years had been engaged in the illicit trade in the \"back of the island,\" but having sufficiently increased his savings, he purchased Appley, and retired there, seemingly far removed from his former connections and avocations.  Boyce even aspired to a seat in the legislature, smuggling not then being looked upon as a very heinous offence. It is located near Appley Towers, the seat of the William Hutt family who bought it in the 1870s. Appley was for many years the mansion house of the Hutt family. One of the proprietors of this estate was Governor of the Colony of Western Australia.

Dates The exact dates of Wulfsige's bishopric and of his demise are uncertain. The editors of The Handbook of British Chronology have placed his date of accession between 879 and 889 and his death between 890 and 896 with a terminal end date of 900. This date is confirmed by the fact that Asser, Wulfsige's successor, was signing charters as bishop of Sherborne in 900. However, it has recently been suggested that Wulfsige of Sherborne might have been the same Wulfsige who succeeded Heahstan as bishop of London around 900, making 900 the approximate year of Wulfsige's transfer rather than his death.  Educational reform under Alfred the Great Wulfsige was a contemporary of King Alfred the Great, who had undertaken an effort of educational reform in his realm, personally translating into English what he considered the works \u201cmost necessary for all men to know.\u201d When Alfred translated the Pastorale of Pope Gregory the Great, he sent a copy to each of his bishops, including Wulfsige, and added a prefatory letter explaining his educational aims and requesting the bishops to educate young men so that they could read these great works, originally composed in Latin. The copy sent to Wulfsige, which includes his name in the preface, survives as MS Ii.2.4 at Cambridge University Library. It is one of only five which are extant today and was the original from which copies were made in the eleventh century.  When Werferth, bishop of Worcester, translated Gregory's Dialogues into English, Alfred sent an exemplar to Wulfsige, who composed a poem that was included as a preface to the work.

Wulfsige was born in the south of England, and became a monk at the famous Abbey of Monkwearmouth-Jarrow, in the north of England, where he was taught by the monk and scholar Alcuin, who was at that time an assistant to the abbot of Monkwearmouth-Jarrow, in the administration of the twin monasteries. Following the disruption of the monasteries in the north of England, after the arrival of the Vikings in the late 8th century, many of the monks from Monkwearmouth-Jarrow fled south to the safer monasteries of the south of England. One of these monks was Wulfsige, who eventually became the abbot of Sherborne Abbey, in Dorset, England, where many of the monks from Monkwearmouth-Jarrow had already settled. Wulfsige was noted for his scholarship, and for his teaching of theology. He is known to have written a commentary on the Book of Revelation, and he may have written other theological works as well. He also helped to organize the library at Sherborne, which eventually developed into the great Sherborne School. Wulfsige was probably responsible for the copying of many of the surviving manuscripts that were produced at Monkwearmouth-Jarrow, and which were then taken to Sherborne. Many of these manuscripts are now preserved in the British Library, and include the Lindisfarne Gospels, the earliest surviving single copy of the Vulgate Bible, and the Codex Amiatinus, which is the earliest surviving copy of the complete Bible in a single volume.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Philadelphian cricket team in England in 1897\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Philadelphian cricket team toured England in the summer of 1897.  Starting on 7 June at Oxford, the tour lasted for two months and ended in late July at The Oval. The Americans played 15 first-class matches captained by George Stuart Patterson.   The match the Philadelphians played against the MCC was to be Patterson's last first-class cricket match. The tour introduced American bowler J Barton King to the international cricketing world.  Tour results  This tour was a very ambitious one for the Americans. They had last toured the British Isles in 1889. Though the results may have been less satisfactory than hoped for by promoters, the tour was arranged mainly for educational purposes and few of those on the American side expected to win many matches. Previous tours had tended to involve amateur English sides with a relatively low level of competition. In 1897 a schedule was made including all of the top county cricket teams, the Oxford and Cambridge University teams, the Marylebone Cricket Club, and two other sides, though only a few of the counties thought it worthwhile to put their best elevens onto the field. While it initially aroused some curiosity, many English fans lost interest until Bart King and the Philadelphians met the full Sussex team at Brighton on 17 June. In the first innings, King proved his batting worth on a fourth-wicket stand of 107 runs with John Lester. He then took 7 wickets for 13 runs and the team dismissed Sussex for 46 in less than an hour. In the second innings, King took 6 for 102 and helped the Philadelphians to a victory by 8 wickets.  Despite the excitement surrounding King's performance, the Americans did not fare well overall. Fifteen matches were played, but only two were won while the team lost nine and earned a draw on four. The other win of the tour came against Warwickshire. During this match King again shined by taking 5 for 95 and 7 for 72 and scoring 46 runs. According to the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack King proved himself to be the best bowler on the American side and had to do much of the work. He bowled three hundred overs more than anyone else. His average was just over 24 runs each for 72 wickets. In addition to his work bowling, King scored 441 runs with an average of just over 20. Captain George Patterson's best innings batting was 162 runs at Trent Bridge against Nottinghamshire.  Controversy Having returned home from the tour, there were claims in the Philadelphia Public Ledger that the Philadelphians had been treated unfairly by the English umpires, but Patterson put those rumors to rest with a letter to the editor of an American newspaper: My attention has been directed to a letter signed W.S. in the Field of July 24th, enclosing a clipping from the Philadelphia Public Ledger, severely criticising the umpiring in the Philadelphian matches during our tour through England. I wish to state on behalf of the Philadelphia team that the sentiments expressed in the clipping are not those of the team, and that we emphatically repudiate any insinuation of unfair treatment. On the contrary, we have been received with the most unvarying courtesy and fairness both on and off the field.

The team played a total of 22 matches against county and other teams, and won 8, with 4 draws and 10 defeats. The tour was not a financial success, and the team was beset by injuries and other problems. The team's best performer was the wicketkeeper and captain John A. Dwight, who scored a total of 662 runs and effected 55 dismissals. The team's leading wicket-taker was Charles C. Young, who took 111 wickets at an average of 17.81. The team's visit was the subject of some derision in England, with some critics questioning the team's legitimacy and ability. The team's performances, however, were generally respectable, and the tour was seen as a success in terms of providing the players with experience and exposure to top-level cricket.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 10376409}

Under \"biological species Information\" all kinds of properties or traits related to taxa\u2014biological and non-biological\u2014are included. Thus, for instance, terms pertaining descriptions,  legal aspects, conservation, management, demographics, nomenclature, or related resources are incorporated.  Description   The Plinian Core is aimed to facilitate the exchange of information about the species and upper taxa. \t What is in scope?  \tSpecies level catalogs of any kind of biological objects or data.   \tTerminology associated with biological collection data.   \tStriving for compatibility with other biodiversity-related standards.   \tFacilitating the addition of components and attributes of biological data.  \tWhat is not in scope?   \tData interchange protocols.   \tNon-biodiversity-related data.   \tOccurrence level data.   \tThis standard is named after Pliny the Elder, a very influential figure in the study of the biological species. \t Plinian Core design requirements includes: ease of use, to be self-contained, able to support data integration from multiple databases, and ability to handle different levels of granularity. Core terms can be grouped in its current version as follows:  \tMetadata  \tBase Elements  \tRecord Metadata  \tNomenclature and Classification  \tTaxonomic description  \tNatural history  \tInvasive species  \tHabitat and Distribution  \tDemography and Threats  \tUses, Management and Conservation  \tassociatedParty, MeasurementOrFact, References, AncillaryData  Background  Plinian Core started as a collaborative project between Instituto Nacional de Biodiversidad and GBIF Spain in 2005. A series of iterations in which elements were defined and implanted in different projects resulted in a \"Plinian Core Flat\" [deprecated].  As a result, a new development was impulse to overcome them in 2012. New formal requirements, additional input and a will to better support the standard and its documentation, as well as to align it with the processes of TDWG, the world reference body for biodiversity information standards.  A new version, Plinian Core v3.x.x was defined. This provides more flexibility to fully represent the information of a species in a variety of scenarios. New elements to deal with aspects such as IPR, related resources, referenced, etc. were introduced, and elements already included were better-defined and documented.  Partner for the development of Plinian Core in this new phase incorporated the University of Granada (UG, Spain), the Alexander von Humboldt Institute (IAvH, Colombia), the National Commission for the Knowledge and Use of Biodiversity (Conabio, Mexico) and the University of S\u00e3o Paulo (USP, Brazil).  A \"Plinian Core Task Group\" within TDWG \"Interest Group on species Information\" was constituted and currently working on its development.  Levels of the standard  Plinian Core is presented in to levels: the abstract model and the application profiles.  The abstract model (AM), comprising the abstract model schema(xsd)  and the terms' URIs, is the normative part. It is all comprehensive, and allows for different levels of granularity in describing species properties. The AM should be taken as a \"menu\" from which to choose terms and level of detail needed in any specific project.  The subsets of the abstract model intended to be implemented in specific projects are the \"application profiles\" (APs). Besides containing part of the elements of the AM, APs can impose additional specifications on the included elements, such as controlled vocabularies.  Some examples of APs in use follow:  Application profile CONABIO  Application profile INBIO  Application profile GBIF.ES  Application profile Banco de Datos de la Naturaleza.Spain  Application profile SIB-COLOMBIA  Relation to other standards  Plinian incorporates a number of elements already defined by other standards.

It is a dramatic example of a controlled gravitational collapse of the eruption column, which is driven by the loss of stability when the magma chamber empties. The name is derived from Pliny the Younger, who described in his letters the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD, and provided the first description of the phenomenon. The Plinian core is a result of the non-stop growth of the eruption column, and is distinct from the more common and shorter-lived volcanic bombs, which are sometimes also called \"plinian\". The eruption column grows when magma is fed to the base of the column, and the weight of the column increases. As the magma chamber empties, the column loses its support, and the weight of the eruption column causes a gravitational collapse. This in turn causes the magma to pool at the base of the column, and the cycle repeats itself. The result is a series of concentric zones within the eruption column, with the cool, brittle, and relatively empty zones near the top, and the warm, less-brittle, and more fluid zones near the bottom. When the Plinian core finally does burst, it releases a tremendous amount of energy, and the outermost zones of the Plinian core are blown away. The remaining Plinian core then collapses, and a base surge is created. The Plinian core has a large amount of potential energy, and when it is released, the energy can trigger further pyroclastic flows. Plinian cores can be very large, and they can have a volume of hundreds of cubic kilometers. They are also very long-lived, and they can survive for thousands of years. The famous Mount St. Helens eruption of 1980 produced a plinian core that was 1,600 feet (488 m) long. The eruption of Mount Spurr in 1992 produced a plinian core that was 3,200 feet (980 m) long.

She was sold for scrapping in 1973.  Namesake Carl Welby Tinsman was born on 29 March 1924 in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. He enlisted in the United States Naval Reserve on 19 August 1942 and served on the destroyer  as a seaman second class. While patrolling some  off the coast of Brazil on 10 March 1943, Eberle, ,  and  intercepted the German blockade runner Karin, flying a Dutch flag. Eberle and Savannah closed on the ship at flank speed and fired warning shots across her bow. Karins crew promptly set her afire and began to abandon ship. Tinsman was a member of the 14-man party from Eberle which boarded the blazing ship and attempted to save the ship. He continued his efforts to put out the fire until a sudden explosion of a demolition charge killed him. He was posthumously awarded the Silver Star.  History Tinsman was laid down by the Bethlehem-Hingham Shipyard, Hingham, Massachusetts, on 21 December 1943; launched on 26 June 1944; sponsored by Mrs. James Corley, sister of Seaman Tinsman; and commissioned on 26 June 1944.  Following fitting out and trials, the destroyer got underway on 21 July 1944, proceeded to Bermuda on shakedown, and returned to Boston on 19 August. On 11 October, she departed Boston harbor and, the next day, joined a convoy bound, via the Panama Canal, for the South Pacific. She arrived at Seeadler Harbor in the Admiralty Islands late in November and, after training exercises, headed for New Guinea. On 2 December, she reached Hollandia, and was soon at sea again escorting a convoy to Leyte.  On 14 December, while Tinsman was in San Pedro Bay, a kamikaze plane grazed the bridge of a nearby tanker. A week later, the destroyer escort was back in New Guinea waters, anchoring in Humboldt Bay. The day after Christmas, she was on the move again, this time for waters off the Vogelkop Peninsula of New Guinea for antisubmarine patrol.  In the first days of the new year, she escorted a convoy to San Pedro Bay; then, on 6 January 1945, she departed Leyte to screen a convoy bound for Lingayen Gulf, Luzon. On 12 January\u2014as Tinsman escorted a slow-moving group consisting of an oiler, tugs, and tows\u2014kamikaze planes attacked her convoy. During the day, the American ships fought off four Japanese attackers, downing two of the planes. On the 13th, Tinsman's guns downed another Japanese aircraft. On the 14th, Tinsman anchored in Lingayen Gulf and retired the next day toward Leyte, arr:ving in San Pedro Bay on the 18th to prepare for the Bandings at Nasugbu, Luzon.  Tinsman departed Leyte Gulf on 27 January 1945 with Amphibious Group 8 and, on the 31st, arrived at Nasugbu Bay where troops of the 11th Airborne Division landed without serious opposition. That night a large number of Japanese Shinyo boats attacked the American ships. Armed with impact bombs, these small craft swarmed out of the darkness and attacked  as she patrolled not far from Tinsman. Tinsman provided illumination to assist Lough in defending herself, sinking at least six of the vessels. Tinsman departed Luzon on 2 February in a convoy bound for Mindoro. Throughout February, she shuttled between Mangarin Bay and Nasugbu Bay on escort duty.  Early in March, she left Leyte Gulf, bound for New Guinea. After taking on stores at Hollandia, Tinsman returned to the Philippines and resumed escort duty. In mid-April, she made a voyage to Palau; and, in July, she varied her routine of convoy duty with visits to Ulithi and Hollandia before returning to the Philippines.  Although the war ended in August, Tinsman remained in the Far East, operating mainly in the Philippines. She also made voyages to Hollandia and Tientsin before setting course for home on 29 November. Steaming via Eniwetok and Pearl Harbor, she arrived at San Pedro, Los Angeles, on 18 December 1945.  She was later berthed at San Diego, where she was placed out of commission on 11 May 1946. On 15 May 1972, her name was struck from the Navy List; and, on 14 September 1973, her hulk was sold to Levin Metals Corporation, San Jose, California, for scrapping.

The Tejano Music Awards were first awarded in 1981 and was established to recognize the most talented performers of Tejano music\u2014a subgenre of regional Mexican music. The nominees were originally selected by a voting poll conducted among program directors and disc jockeys of Spanish-language radio stations in Texas. Originally, winners were chosen by Tejano radio station KIWW listeners, and later by fans of Tejano musicians in the Southwest of the United States. Winners are selected through a survey of 50,000 Texas households with Hispanic surnames. By 1987, the award ceremony was broadcast through 32 radio stations and 25 local television channels in Texas, New Mexico, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Louisiana. The awards ceremony were originally held at the Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center, then to the San Antonio Convention Center until 1994, and the Alamodome until 1999. As of 2015, the ceremony is held annually at the Tobin Center for the Performing Arts in San Antonio, Texas.  The award was first presented to Lisa Lopez for two consecutive years. Lopez was credited to have become the first female Tejano singer to have a number one single on the Regional Mexican Airplay chart in 1982. Tejano music's \"first leading lady\", Laura Canales won the award for four consecutive times. The \"Queen of Tejano music\" Selena, dominated the awards for nine consecutive years and dominated the Tejano Music Award for Female Vocalist of the Year for much of the 1990s decade.

He was credited with successfully advising the US against nuclear escalation in the 1970s.  Background Des Ball attended the Australian National University in 1965, shifting from being a promising student in economics to security studies. He completed a PhD supervised by Hedley Bull, on the global nuclear strategies of the United States and the Soviet Union. He was based for several months in the USA at the Institute of War and Peace.  He joined ANU as a lecturer in 1974, later becoming Special Professor in the Strategic and Defence Studies Centre in the ANU College of Asia and the Pacific in 1987.  Ball was an opponent of the draft for the Vietnam War in Australia (although not the war itself, at the time), and was arrested for protesting against it. He won an appeal in the Supreme Court against his conviction. From 1966 he was a \"person of interest\" for ASIO, particularly following his inquiries into the Pine Gap secret tracking facility and Nurrungar in Australia from 1969, and was taken to court after the publication of A Suitable Piece of Real Estate in 1980. He held ASIO in disdain, for its inability to recognise aspects of defence co-operation with the US infringed Australian national interests by remaining entirely secret.  Ball was diagnosed with incurable cancer and died on 12 October 2016 at the age of 69. Despite his illness, he continued writing and working until his death.  Contributions  Ball was a political realist, and a believer in liberal institutions and solid defence strategies. He used an inductive, investigative approach to security studies.  During the Cold War, Ball was invited to critique US nuclear defence plans\u2014his analysis persuading the US that its plan to destroy selected Soviet targets in a limited strike would not work in practice and would lead to all-out nuclear escalation. His analysis has been acknowledged by President Jimmy Carter.  Ball worked on Australia's signal intelligence and exposed Australia's secret history of cracking diplomatic cables. In 1998 with David Horner he confirmed wartime Soviet spying in Australia revealed by the Petrov Affair, carried out by staff in Evatt's Foreign Affairs Department.    He studied, and was active in, some of Southeast Asia's \"shadow wars\". He was a supporter of Karen independence, having discovered the extent of Burmese Army human rights abuses, and advised the Karen National Liberation Army along the Thai/Myanmar border on successful guerrilla warfare from the early-2000s. He made over 85 research trips to the region.  He worked with the Council for Security Cooperation in the Asia Pacific, and believed the biggest threat in the early 21st century would be the potential for conflict escalation in north-east Asia.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Blue iguana\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The blue iguana (Cyclura lewisi), also known as the Grand Cayman ground iguana, Grand Cayman blue iguana or Cayman Island rock iguana, is an endangered species of lizard which is endemic to the island of Grand Cayman. It was previously considered to be a subspecies of the Cuban iguana, Cyclura nubila, but in a 2004 article Frederic J. Burton reclassified it as a separate species because according to him the genetic differences discovered four years earlier between the different C. nubila populations warranted this interpretation. The blue iguana is one of the longest-living species of lizard (possibly up to 69\u00a0years).  The preferred habitat for the blue iguana is rocky, sunlit, open areas in dry forests or near the shore, as the females must dig holes in the sand to lay eggs in June and July. A possible second clutch is laid in September. The blue iguana's herbivorous diet includes plants, fruits, and flowers. Its color is tan to gray with a bluish cast that is more pronounced during the breeding season and more so in males. It is large and heavy-bodied with a dorsal crest of short spines running from the base of the neck to the end of the tail.  The iguana was possibly abundant before European colonization; but fewer than 15\u00a0animals remained in the wild by 2003, and this wild population was predicted to become extinct within the first decade of the 21st century. The species' decline is mainly being driven by predation by cats and dogs, and indirectly by reduction in suitable habitat as fruit farms are converted to pasture for cattle grazing. Since 2004, hundreds of captive-bred animals have been released into a preserve on Grand Cayman run by a partnership headed by the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, in an attempt to save the species. At least five non-profit organizations are working with the government of the Cayman Islands to ensure the survival of the blue iguana.  Taxonomy Its specific name lewisi commemorates the name of the scientist who collected the holotype of this species, Charles Bernard Lewis.  The closest relatives are the Cuban iguana (Cyclura nubila) and the Northern Bahamian rock iguana (C. cychlura). It can be genetically distinguished from the subspecies found on Little Cayman and Cayman Brac known as C. nubila caymanensis, although it can interbreed with this subspecies and produce fertile offspring.  In 1938 Lewis of the Institute of Jamaica joined an Oxford University biological expedition to the Cayman Islands. Lewis obtained two blue iguanas, a male and a female, which were later lodged with the Natural History Museum, London. Chapman Grant, in an article published in 1940, formally described the blue iguana as an separate taxon for the first time, classifying it as the trinomial C. macleayi lewisi. Albert Schwartz and Richard Thomas reclassified it as C. nubila lewisi in 1975, making it a subspecies of the Cuban iguana. In his 2004 article Frederick Burton repeatedly states Schwartz and Carey reclassified it in a 1977 publication, but he is mistaken.  Burton, who runs the captive breeding program on the island, reclassified the blue iguana as a distinct species in 2004. Although it has almost identical head scale counts and patterns as C. nubila, most individuals of this taxon often have five auricular spines in as opposed to four in caymanensis, although this is not diagnostic, and individuals of the nominate subspecies shows either morphologies in similar proportions. Also most lewisi have an extra pair scales behind the prefrontals, although not always and individuals from the other populations may also have these. Thus Burton concluded that using scale characteristics these three taxa could not be told apart in a consistent manner. According to him most important difference between the lewisi population and the other two is skin color. Although skin color is a variable characteristic that is usually considered unsatisfactory in taxonomy, Burton thought that in this instance it might be appropriate. Although all three taxa hatch with the same color, as they grow older lewisi becomes more uniformly bluish, whereas the other taxa can be more variable in coloration, although Burton states that this characteristic is not reliable in many circumstances, such as rainy weather. Other reasons Burton gave for recognising lewisi as a separate species were geography, there is at least 108 kilometres separating the forms, which Burton then interpreted to mean that the populations were reproductively isolated, despite there being no reproductive barriers between the populations. Grant reported seeing caymanensis on Grand Cayman in 1940, but Burton states that this was likely a mistaken sighting made during rainy weather. Lastly Burton points to mitochondrial DNA analysis performed by Catherine Malone et al. in 2000; although the sample size was extremely small and there was some ambiguity, the different populations did have different haplotypes. Although Malone et al. found C. nubila sensu lato to be monophyletic, Burton claimed lewisi could be separated from the other two taxa without rendering C. nubila polyphyletic. Although none of this might be used to traditionally delineate a population as a species, he proposed using the \"general lineage concept\" introduced by de Queiroz in 1998 to do so anyway.  Common names This animal was originally called the Grand Cayman rock iguana, or Grand Cayman blue rock iguana. After separating this population taxonomically from the other Cayman Islands rock iguanas, Burton proposed a set of new vernacular names for the population in 2004: Grand Cayman blue iguana, Cayman blue iguana or for local colloquial use he proposed the simple abbreviated blue iguana.  Note that the name \"blue iguana\" is also used for bright blue forms of the green iguana, Iguana iguana.  Description The blue iguana is the largest native land animal on Grand Cayman with a total nose-to-tail length of  and weighing as much as . This is among the largest species of lizard in the Western Hemisphere. The largest of the Cyclura, its body length is  with a tail equal in length. The blue iguana's toes are articulated to be efficient in digging and climbing trees. The mature male's skin color ranges from dark grey to turquoise blue, whereas the female is more olive green to pale blue. Young animals tend to be uniformly dark brown or green with faint darker banding. When they first emerge from the nest the neonates have an intricate pattern of eight dark dorsal chevrons from the crest of their necks to their pelvic area. These markings fade by the time the animal is one year old, changing to mottled gray and cream and eventually giving way to blue as adults. The adult blue iguana is typically dark gray matching the karst rock of its landscape. The animal changes its color to blue when it is in the presence of other iguanas to signal and establish territory. The blue color is more pronounced in males of the species. Their distinctive black feet stand in contrast to their lighter overall body color. The blue iguana's eyes have a golden iris and red sclera.  Blue iguanas are sexually dimorphic; males are larger and have more prominent dorsal crests as well as larger femoral pores on their thighs, which are used to release pheromones. The male is larger than the female by one third of his body size.  Distribution The blue iguana is endemic to the island of Grand Cayman. As of 2012 the population can be found throughout the island Grand Cayman excluding the urban areas of Bodden Town, Gun Bay, Seven Mile Beach and West Bay. One theory for how the taxon ended up on the island is that a single female Cuban iguana, C. nubila nubila, with eggs inside her drifted across the sea, perhaps during a storm. Sometimes the Lesser Caymans iguana, C. nubila caymanensis, has been found on Grand Cayman.  Ecology  Habitat   The blue iguana is found only on the island of Grand Cayman. Comparison with other Cyclura species in the region strongly suggests that there was once a coastal population of blue iguanas which was gradually displaced or extirpated by human settlements and the construction of roads. The blue iguana now only occurs inland in natural xerophytic shrubland and along the interfaces between farm clearings, roads, and gardens and closed-canopy dry forest or shrubland. The interior population is believed to have been attracted to agricultural clearings and fruit farms which provide thermoregulatory opportunities, herbaceous browse, fallen fruit, and nesting soil, but this brought the blue iguana into contact with humans and feral animals. Females often migrate to coastal areas to nest. Blue iguanas released into the Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park on Grand Cayman were radiotracked in 2004 to determine ranges for each animal. Females were found to occupy territories of  and males an average of  with overlap in common territories, indicating that they choose to maintain a population density of four to five animals per hectare.  The blue iguanas occupy rock holes and tree cavities, and as adults are primarily terrestrial. Although not known to be arboreal, it has been observed climbing trees  and higher. Younger individuals tend to be more arboreal.  Diet Like all Cyclura species, the blue iguana is primarily herbivorous, consuming leaves, flowers, and fruits from over 45\u00a0species of plant. The diet is very rarely supplemented with insects, crabs, slugs and fungi.  Predators Hatchlings are preyed upon by the native snake Alsophis cantherigerus. The adults have no natural predators.  Longevity Longevity in the wild is unknown but is presumed to be many decades. A blue iguana named \"Godzilla\" captured on Grand Cayman in 1950 by naturalist Ira Thompson was imported to the United States in 1985 by Ramon Noegel and sold to reptile importer and breeder, Tom Crutchfield in 1990. Crutchfield donated Godzilla to the Gladys Porter Zoo in Brownsville, Texas in 1997 and the lizard remained there until its death in 2004. Thompson estimated Godzilla to be 15\u00a0years of age at the time of his capture. At an estimated 69\u00a0years of age (54\u00a0of which were spent in captivity), Godzilla may be the world's longest-living lizard for which there is reliable record. A closely related Lesser Caymans iguana (C. nubila caymanensis) has been documented as living 33\u00a0years in captivity.  Reproduction Mating occurs from May through June. Copulation is preceded by numerous head-bobs on the part of the male, who then circles around behind the female and grasps the nape of her neck. He then attempts to restrain the female in order to manoeuvre his tail under hers to position himself for intromission (copulation). Copulation generally lasts from 30\u00a0to 90\u00a0seconds, and a pair is rarely observed mating more than once or twice a day. A clutch of anywhere from 1\u00a0to 21\u00a0eggs are usually laid in June or July depending on the size and age of the female, in nests excavated in pockets of earth exposed to the sun. Several exploratory nests are begun before one is completed. These burrows can range from  to over  in length, with an enlarged chamber at its terminal portion to allow the female to turn around. The temperature within nests that have been monitored by researchers remained a constant  throughout the incubation period which ranges from 65 to 90\u00a0days. The blue iguana's eggs are among the largest laid by any lizard.  Individuals are aggressively territorial from the age of about three\u00a0months onward. They typically reach sexual maturity after four years of age in captivity.  Conservation  Endangered status  The blue iguana is listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List. In 1988 the British researcher Roger Avery spent two weeks on the island and only observed three animals. Surveys in 2003 indicated a total population in the range of 5\u201315\u00a0individuals. In 2006 the iguana was one of the most endangered lizards on Earth.  Restored free-roaming subpopulations in the Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park and the Salina Reserve numbered approximately 125\u00a0individuals in total after an initial release in December 2005. The restored subpopulation in the Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park has been breeding since 2001, and the subpopulation in the Salina Reserve was deemed to be breeding in 2006 after a nest of three hatched eggs was discovered in the wild. In April 2007, after another large-scale release, there were 299\u00a0blue iguanas living in the wild, with hundreds more being raised in captivity on Grand Cayman. In late 2012, the blue iguana recovery program estimated that the wild population had risen to approximately 750 individuals, and the IUCN subsequently downlisted the species from critically endangered to endangered.  International trade in the species is regulated due to its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.  Causes of decline  Habitat destruction is the main factor threatening extinction for this iguana. Land clearance within remnant habitat is occurring for agriculture, road construction, and real estate development and speculation. The conversion of traditional crop lands to cattle pasture is eliminating secondary blue iguana habitat.  Predation and injury to hatchlings by rats, to hatchlings and sub-adults by feral cats, and killing of adults by pet dogs are all placing severe pressure on the remaining wild population. Automobiles and motorscooters are an increasing cause of mortality as the iguanas rarely survive the collisions. Trapping and shooting is a comparatively minor concern, and has stopped according to the IUCN in 2012, but before 1995 occasional trapping may have occurred.  The common green iguana, (Iguana iguana), has been introduced from Honduras and is well-established on Grand Cayman as an invasive species. It far outnumbers the native blue iguana. No direct negative consequences on the blue iguana due to this introduction are known, but the mere presence of the green iguana confuses public attitudes and understanding. For example, the people of the island are told that blue iguanas are endangered and rare, but the green iguana looks very similar and are quite common in suburban areas.  In 2008 six blue iguanas were found dead in the preserve within Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park on Grand Cayman. The iguanas were apparently killed by human vandals armed with knives and two of the slaughtered animals were gravid females about to lay eggs.  The wild population of blue iguanas had been reduced from a near island-wide distribution to a non-viable, fragmented remnant. By 2001 no young hatched in the unmanaged wild population were surviving to breeding age, meaning the population was functionally extinct, with only five animals remaining in the wild.  Recovery efforts In 1990, the American Zoo and Aquarium Association designated the genus Cyclura as their highest priority for conservation. Their first project was an in situ captive breeding program for the blue iguana.  One of the early difficulties encountered was that the captive stock of the early 1990s was found not to be pure. It was discovered through DNA analysis that the captive population contained a number of animals that were hybrids with C. nubila caymanensis. These hybrids were sterilized by means of hemipenectomies so that the program contain only pure-breeds. This program was created to determine the exact genealogies of the limited gene pool of the remaining animals and DNA analysis revealed that the entire North American captive population was descended from a single pair of animals.  As a hedge against disaster striking the blue iguana population on Grand Cayman, in 2004 an ex situ captive population was established in 25\u00a0zoos in the USA. A minimum of 20\u00a0founder lines represented by at least 225\u00a0individuals is being maintained by captive breeding and recorded in a studbook for the species by Tandora Grant of the San Diego Zoo's Center for Conservation and Research for Endangered Species. By 2002 the Indianapolis Zoo had success with breeding the blue iguana in captivity twice since the year 2000.  In October 2006, hatchlings were released into the wild for the first time to boost the species and help bring them back from the brink of extinction. Each released blue iguana wears a string of colored beads through its nuchal crest for visual identification at a distance, backed up by an implanted microchip and a high-resolution photograph of its head scales. Head scale patterns are as unique among blue iguanas as fingerprints are among humans.  The blue iguana is established in captivity, both in public and private collections. There are very few pure-bred animals in private collections, animals in captive breeding programs are often hybrids with the Lesser Caymans Iguana\u00a0(C. nubila caymanensis) and occasional hybrids with the Cuban Iguana\u00a0(C. nubila nubila). Breeding in the pet trade minimizes the demand for wild-caught specimens.  Blue Iguana Recovery Programme  The Blue Iguana Recovery Programme grew from a small project started in 1990 within the National Trust for the Cayman Islands. It is now a partnership, linking the Trust with the Cayman Islands Department of Environment, National Trust Cayman Islands, Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park, Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, International Reptile Conservation Foundation, IRCF, and the European Commission. This program operates under a special exemption from provisions in the Animals Law of the Cayman Islands, which normally would make it illegal for anyone to kill, capture, or keep iguanas. BIRP's conservation strategy involves generating large numbers of genetically diverse hatchlings, headstarting them for two years so that their chance of survival in the wild is high, and using these animals to rebuild a series of wild sub-populations in protected, managed natural areas. A rapid numerical increase from a maximum possible number of founding stock is sought to minimize loss of genetic diversity caused by a population bottleneck.  Restored sub-populations are present in two non-contiguous areas \u2014the Salina Reserve and the Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park. Habitat protection is still vital, as the Salina Reserve has only  of dry shrubland, which is not enough to sustain the 1,000\u00a0blue iguanas that were planned to be restored to the wild. The 2001 plan called for additional sub-populations to be restored in one or more other areas. When the wild sub-populations have reached the carrying capacity of their respective protected areas, release of head-started animals will be phased out.  The overall captive population is likely to remain genetically fragmented in the long term. To maintain gene flow, individuals should be translocated between zoos.  According to the 2001 plan, breeding of blue iguanas in the wild will require indefinite future management. To sustain this activity, a range of commercial activities was hoped to generate the required funding. An education and awareness effort in 2007 was meant to ensure local involvement and support.  In April 2019, one iguana laid 18 eggs for possible hatching. Any survivals will be the first successful breeding since 2015. In 2018, seven eggs were laid but none hatched.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Donat Makijonek\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Poruchik Donat Aduiovich Makijonek (19 May 1890 \u2013 18 June 1941) was a World War I flying ace credited with eight aerial victories. He was the only ace of Polish ethnic heritage to fight against the Central Powers. In later life, he would help found Polish military aviation immediately after World War I, and fight in the Polish-Soviet War of 1919-1921.  Biography  Early life and prewar service  Donat Makijonek was born into a peasant family in the village of Dambovka, Osvedskoy volost, the province of Vitebsk, in the Russian Empire on 19 May 1890. He was ethnically Polish, and was raised in the Roman Catholic faith. He was schooled in a vocational technical school in Vitebsk. He graduated in 1906, at age 16. On 7 November 1911, he was conscripted into the 97th Infantry Liflandsky Regiment for his military service. At the time he joined, the Imperial Russian Air Service planned to expand greatly the following year.  In December 1911, Makijonek requested posting to aviation duty. On 4 April 1912, he transferred to 3rd Korpusnoi Aviatsionniy Otryad (Corps Aviation Detachment) of the 4th Aviation Company. On 10 June 1912, he was forwarded to the Sevastopol Military Flying School for training as a motor mechanic; he subsequently served the school in that capacity. The IRAS at that time could not find sufficient officers for pilot's training; they consequently opened the training to enlisted men. Makijonek applied for, and was accepted for, pilot's training and trained on the Nieuport IV monoplane. He graduated from training on 7 March 1914, being granted brevet number 239. He was then promoted thrice in quick succession\u2013on 17 May 1914 to Efreitor; on 1 June 1914 to Mladshy Unter-Officer; and on 27 June 1914 to Starshyi Unter-Officer (Senior Sergeant).  World War I service  Three days after the start of hostilities, the 3rd Korpusnoi Aviatsionniy Otryad (Corps Aviation Detachment), including Makijonek, was committed to combat in eastern Prussia. This early in the war, he flew a two-seater Nieuport IV on reconnaissance missions. On 21 August 1914, Makijonek air-couriered vital orders from higher headquarters to General Huseyn Khan Nakhchivanski of the Guards Cavalry Corps; the pilot earned the Cross of St. George Fourth Class for this feat. The next month, September 1914, Makijonek took transition training for the Morane-Saulnier Ls with which the 3rd KAO was re-equipping, as its existing craft were badly worn. He completed the training on 19 November and returned to his unit. The 3rd KAO ended 1914 back on active status as of 23 December, though flying few flights due to winter weather conditions.  Such missions as were flown in early 1915 were exposed to the hazard of anti-aircraft fire. On 27 April 1915, Makijonek was flying reconnaissance in Morane-Saulnier G serial number MS107 when a bullet hit his engine. After the motor stopped, he barely stretched his glide over enemy lines to safety with Russian troops near Nida. He pulled his aerial observer from the overturned aircraft and hustled them both in a crawl into a nearby trench as enemy artillery rained in on the wreckage. The feat won the doughty young pilot the Third Class Cross of Saint George, awarded 28 April 1915.  On 16 June 1915, Makijonek and his observer espied an enemy offensive abuilding in the vicinity of Sandomierz; a bridge was being built across the San River to convey an attack into Russian territory. A timely report of this to Russian headquarters garnered him a Second Class award of the Cross of Saint George, and a promotion to Podpraporshchik on the 19th. Makijonek's brave performances continued through the Summer of 1915; on 4 October 1915, his courage  earned him a deserved promotion to Praporshchik.  It was also in October that the 3rd KAO was withdrawn from combat and sent for a rest in Odessa. With the exception of training flights, the unit stood down for nearly a month. They entrained to return to action on 12 December 1915, their unit now being posted to the Imperial Russian 7th Army. By year's end, they were back in action.  On 13 January 1916, Donat Makijonek was deemed experienced enough to be appointed as a military pilot by Imperial Order. Sometime thereafter, he applied for training on fighter aircraft. After acceptance, he trained on Nieuport 11s at Odessa. He graduated on 12 August 1916, and was commissioned into the officer's ranks as a Podporuchik. In December 1916, he was assigned to the 7th Aviatsionniy Otryad Istrebitlei (Fighter Aviation Detachment), which was based near Tarnopol and commanded by Ivan Orlov. Makijonek fought several furious engagements during February 1917, though without success. He realized that an experienced wingman would improve his chances. He struck up both a working partnership and a close friendship with Vasili Yanchenko.  He won for the first time on 7 March 1917, splitting the victory with Yanchenko. Five weeks later, on 13 April, Makijonek shared a pair of triumphs with both Yanchenko and Juri Gilsher. On 16 April and 29 June, he scored clean solo victories. On 4 July 1917, his commander, Ivan Orlov, was killed in action; Gilsher assumed command. On both the 6th and the 11th, Makijonek and Yanchenko once again shared victories.  On 20 July, Makijonek, Gilsher, and Yanchenko flew an evening sortie to intercept eight enemy fighters. Makijonek was waylaid en route by an enemy fighter, and engaged it. Gilsher and Yanchenko flew into a lopsided battle against 16 enemy aircraft. Juri Gilsher died in action when his aircraft fell apart in midair. After his commander's death, Makijonek stepped into the vacant command slot.  There are two versions of what transpired next. According to one source, Makijonek was severely wounded while scoring his eighth victory on 5 August 1917. He was medically evacuated, winding up in a hospital in Sevastopol. While convalescing, his promotion to Poruchik came through on 27 September 1917. On 8 November 1917, he returned to frontline duty, to find the Russian forces pretty much inactive. A more recent source relates that he took his last flight on 19 August 1917. In this account, he staked two combat claims that went unapproved. Then, on the 24th, he fell ill and was superseded in his command. He was then sent to the rear to \"study machine gun techniques\" at Evpatoria in the Crimea. Makijonek ended up in the Red Cross hospital in Sevastopol at first. While there, he was promoted to Stabskapit\u00e4n on 27 September 1917. He then attended the machine gun course, graduating in November. He was sent to Petrograd to work in the Aviation and Aeronautic Department, but its work had ground to a halt because of the Revolution. In this version, he then returned to the 7th AOI.  Regardless of which version is true, Makijonek next applied for a transfer to the Polish Corps on the basis of a Supreme Committee order for unifying the Poles in Russian service. On 18 January 1918, Captain Makijonek loaded his mechanic into a two-seater and flew to Kamianets-Podilskyi. He left the Imperial Russian Air Service after almost 600 combat missions and more than 30 aerial battles. In the process, he had operated 14 types of aircraft.  Post World War I life  Makijonek helped found the 1st Polish Aviation Detachment, and became its deputy commander. In 1919, he was a member of the commission that selected the Plage i La\u015bkiewicz factory for building new Ansaldo airplanes. By the time the Polish\u2013Soviet War began in 1920, Makijonek commanded the 3rd Polish Squadron. He was still in command in 1921, after the war's end. After that, little is known of him. He is believed to have died in Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Oxalis triangularis\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Oxalis triangularis, commonly called false shamrock, is a species of perennial plant in the family Oxalidaceae. It is native to several countries in southern South America. This woodsorrel is typically grown as a houseplant but can be grown outside in USDA climate zones 8a\u201311, preferably in light shade.  The deep maroon leaves are trifoliate, like species in the clover genus Trifolium which are commonly called shamrock, hence the name \u201cfalse shamrock\u201d. An interesting feature is that the leaves close like an umbrella at night (See the timelapse video below) or when disturbed or if kept under harsh sunlight. The white or pale pink five-petalled flowers also close at night.  Description Growing to  tall and broad, the subspecies O. triangularis subsp. papilionacea, the purpleleaf false shamrock, is hardy in mild and coastal areas of Britain, down to , and has won the Royal Horticultural Society\u2019s Award of Garden Merit. It is a perennial plant without aerial stem, formed by leaves borne by a long petiole emerging at the ground level of a tuberous rhizome (5 cm long, over 10 - 15  mm in diameter, fully covered with scales). The leaf is formed of three sessile leaflets, obtriangular to obovate-triangular, glabrous, arranged in the same plane perpendicular to the petiole.  The five densely haired sepals are 5 to 5.5 mm long, narrow and slightly reddish at the top. The five white petals are about 2 inches long and oblong-lanceolate. The stamens and the style are densely hairy. The limb of the wild species is green but purple cultivars have been selected for horticulture. The petiole, soft, whitish, is 15 to 25 cm long. Flowering takes place from spring to autumn.  Movement  The leaves of O. triangularis move in response to light levels, opening in high ambient light (in the day) and closing at low light levels (at night). During this movement, the leaflets fold at the level of the central vein. This movement is not due to growth and is instead powered by changes in turgor pressure in cells at the base of the leaf. It is an example of photonasty.  Range The species is distributed in several countries of South America: Brazil, Bolivia, Argentina and Paraguay. It is a neophyte in the United States in the states of Florida and Louisiana. It is also widely found in East India abundantly in states like Nagaland and Manipur.  Cultivation and life cycle  O. triangularis requires bright indirect sunlight supplemented with a cool indoor temperature of . It can tolerate higher indoor temperatures but will go into dormancy prematurely and/or begin to take on a \"tired\" appearance if temperatures exceed  for prolonged periods of time. It thrives in an average potting soil with good drainage.  Mature plants are cut back to the soil every 3\u20135 years in early summer or during the dormancy period.  Young plants are cut back to the soil every year in early summer or during the dormancy period, until they reach maturity. Fearing frost, they are usually grown indoors. They are planted in soil rich in humus and well drained. They should be watered only when the topsoil looks dry. In winter, they should not be watered.  The subspecies Oxalis triangularis subsp papilionacea has won the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.  Usage The leaves are eaten raw or cooked and have an acidic taste due to their oxalic acid content. Leaves and flowers can be used as a decoration for salads. When consuming larger amounts of leaves, the oxalic acid can cause discomfort. The rhizomes are eaten raw or cooked and have a sweet taste.  Propagation Oxalis triangularis grows from corms, propagated by division. Like other corms, it goes through regular dormancy periods; at the end of each period, the corms can be unearthed, offsets cut and replanted in appropriate soil, where they will grow into new plants.

Jermaine, a 15-year-old student at St. Joseph's College, was stabbed by a group of teenagers as part of a premeditated attack. This was one of the most prominent cases linking knife crime to Drill music, as it is believed that his death was foreshadowed in a drill music video.  Background  Aspiring architect Jermaine Goupall, 15, was a student at St. Joseph's College and attended Saturday school at Croydon Supplementary Education Project.  After an evening with friends at a cinema in the summer holidays, the group were ambushed by masked thugs armed with knives in the Thornton Heath area.  Jermaine was stabbed seven times and the fatal wound being to his femoral artery to his right thigh. Despite best efforts from bystanders and emergency services, Jermaine bled to death and was pronounced dead at the scene, Jermaine was less than 100 yards from his home. [NK1]  Trial  On 8 January 2018 the trial for Jermaine's murder took place at the Old Bailey. Four out of the five youths were convicted on 14 February 2018, resulting in three of the offenders being sentenced to a total of 72 years for premeditated murder.[1]r.  Adam Benzahi, 21, Samuel Oliver-Rowland, 18, Junior Simpson, 17 were found guilty of murder. Saskia Haye-Elliot,18 was found guilty of manslaughter.  On the first day of the trial, the court was told by Mukul Chawla QC (Jermaine's Barrister) that Haye-Elliot says she thought they were going to \"annoy or irate\" members of the CR7 gang by videoing them for Snapchat and or YouTube. Though Jermaine was not a member of the CR7 gang he sadly was caught by the offenders based on an assumption because he lived in the area. Haye-Elliot and Simpson both accept they were in the Ford Focus car that was driven to the scene on the night of Jermaine's death.  During the trial Simpson said he was not aware that anyone was hurt until the three other passengers in the car returned. He also denied knowledge stating he was unaware of any knives, masks or balaclavas being in the car, as the prosecution alleges.  The court heard how Simpson has a previous conviction of possessing a knife, in 2015, to which he pleaded guilty.  Croydon Advertiser and BBC News reported heavily on Jermaine's case throughout. Croydon Advertiser, spoke to the Goupall family after perpetrators were convicted.  Jermaine was unknown to the offenders and during the court trial, all of the offenders stated that they never knew who he was and never had an issue with him. Extensive detail on what happened to Jermaine that fatal night was highlighted in court, brining to light that they were out to catch anyone they thought and believed to be in the opposing gang.  Aftermath  Jermaine Goupall's case has been  influential because it was one of the first cases to highlight YouTube and Drill music as evidence for a murder. After, Jermaine's trial the director of public prosecutions, Max Hill stated that \"Violent social media posts must be used by prosecutors to crackdown on gangs.\"  His death has been a point of reference highlighting bans and sanctions from making music  which may initiate a threat of violence. Notably the music  group, 1011  were banned from making music.  Jermaine's death featured on episode 5 of the Channel 5 show Gangland, a show that exposes the violent world of London's violent gangs and how children are being recruited into gangs that plague the capital's streets. Another documentary which highlighted Jermaine's murder was the Channel 5 Star series 'When Teens Kill'. As well as this, Jermaine's death had made two BBC documentaries on 1 May 2018 - \"How a drill music video foreshadowed a murder\" & 26 September 2018 - \"London knife crime: Who was Jermaine Goupall?\". In 2019, Who was Jermaine Goupall, BBC video was nominated for an award at the BBC Awards Ceremony.  In April 2018, there was backlash from the Goupall family because the YouTube videos were still available on-line.  On 29 May 2018, it was announced on the BBC's news outlet that YouTube had removed more than 30 Drill music video's, following  the conversations with the Metropolitan Police, The police have also referenced short clips  about Jermaine from BBC videos.     In October 2019, Stanley Goupall was invited on the Victoria Derbyshire Show along with other men who had lost loved ones to knife crime, which included a short documentary \"Men who lost loved ones to knife crime\" which was up for a BAFA award in July 2020. Which left such a powerful impact on others.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Bessarabia\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Bessarabia (; ; ; , Bessarabiya; ; , Bessarabiya; , Besarabiya) is a historical region in Eastern Europe, bounded by the Dniester river on the east and the Prut river on the west. About two thirds of Bessarabia lies within modern-day Moldova, with the Ukrainian Budjak region covering the southern coastal region and part of the Ukrainian Chernivtsi Oblast covering a small area in the north.  In the aftermath of the Russo-Turkish War (1806\u20131812), and the ensuing Peace of Bucharest, the eastern parts of the Principality of Moldavia, an Ottoman vassal, along with some areas formerly under direct Ottoman rule, were ceded to Imperial Russia. The acquisition was among the Empire's last territorial acquisitions in Europe. The newly acquired territories were organised as the Bessarabia Governorate of the Russian Empire, adopting a name previously used for the southern plains between the Dniester and the Danube rivers. Following the Crimean War, in 1856, the southern areas of Bessarabia were returned to Moldavian rule; Russian rule was restored over the whole of the region in 1878, when Romania, the result of Moldavia's union with Wallachia, was pressured into exchanging those territories for the Dobruja.  In 1917, in the wake of the Russian Revolution, the area constituted itself as the Moldavian Democratic Republic, an autonomous republic part of a proposed federative Russian state. Bolshevik agitation in late 1917 and early 1918 resulted in the intervention of the Romanian Army, ostensibly to pacify the region. Soon after, the parliamentary assembly declared independence, and then union with the Kingdom of Romania. However, the legality of these acts was disputed, most prominently by the Soviet Union, which regarded the area as a territory occupied by Romania.  In 1940, after securing the assent of Nazi Germany through the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact, the Soviet Union pressured Romania, under threat of war, into withdrawing from Bessarabia, allowing the Red Army to enter and the Soviet Union to annex the region. The area was formally integrated into the Soviet Union: the core joined parts of the Moldavian ASSR to form the Moldavian SSR, while territories inhabited by Slavic majorities in the north and the south of Bessarabia were transferred to the Ukrainian SSR. Axis-aligned Romania recaptured the region in 1941 with the success of Operation M\u00fcnchen during the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, but lost it in 1944 as the tide of war turned. In 1947, the Soviet-Romanian border along the Prut was internationally recognised by the Paris Treaty that ended World War II.  During the process of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Moldavian and Ukrainian SSRs proclaimed their independence in 1991, becoming the modern states of Moldova and Ukraine while preserving the existing partition of Bessarabia. Following a short war in the early 1990s, the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic was proclaimed in the Transnistria, extending its authority also over the municipality of Bender on the right bank of Dniester river. Part of the Gagauz-inhabited areas in southern Bessarabia was organised in 1994 as an autonomous region within Moldova.  Etymology and usage of the name   According to the traditional explanation, the name Bessarabia (Basarabia in Romanian) derives from the Wallachian Basarab dynasty, who allegedly ruled over the southern part of the area in the 14th century. However, some scholars question this, claiming that:  the name was initially an exonym applied by Western cartographers  it was first used in local sources only in the late 17th century;  the idea that it referred to Moldavian regions near the Black Sea was explicitly rejected as a cartographic confusion by the early Moldavian chronicler Miron Costin, and;  the confusion may have been caused by medieval Western cartographers, misinterpreting contemporaneous Polish references to Wallachia as Bessarabia as referring to a separate land between Wallachia and Moldavia.  According to Dimitrie Cantemir, the name Bessarabia originally applied only to the part of the territory south of the Upper Trajanic Wall, i.e. an area only slightly bigger than present-day Budjak.  Geography  The region is bounded by the Dniester to the north and east, the Prut to the west, and the lower River Danube and Black Sea to the south. It has an area of . The area is mostly hilly plains and flat steppes. It is very fertile and has lignite deposits and stone quarries. People living in the area grow sugar beet, sunflower, wheat, maize, tobacco, wine grapes, and fruit. They raise sheep and cattle. The main industry in the region is agricultural processing.  The main cities are Chi\u0219in\u0103u (former capital of the Russian Bessarabia Governorate, now capital of Moldova), and Izmail and Bilhorod-Dnistrovs'kyi (historically called Cetatea Alb\u0103 and Akkerman; both now within Ukraine). Other towns of administrative or historical importance include: Khotyn, Reni, and Kilia (all now in Ukraine); and Lipcani, Briceni, Soroca, B\u0103l\u021bi, Orhei, Ungheni, Bender/Tighina, and Cahul (all now in Moldova).  History   In the late 14th century, the newly established Principality of Moldavia encompassed what later became known as Bessarabia. Afterward, this territory was directly or indirectly, partly or wholly controlled by: the Ottoman Empire (as suzerain of Moldavia, with direct rule only in Budjak and Khotyn), Russian Empire, Romania, the USSR. Since 1991, most of the territory forms the core of Moldova, with smaller parts in Ukraine.  Prehistory   People have inhabited the territory of Bessarabia for thousands of years. Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture flourished between the 6th and 3rd millennium BC.  Ancient times   In Antiquity the region was inhabited by Thracians, as well as for shorter periods by Cimmerians, Scythians, Sarmatians, and Celts, specifically by tribes such as the Costoboci, Carpi, Britogali, Tyragetae, and Bastarnae. In the 6th century BC, Greek settlers established the colony of Tyras along the Black Sea coast and traded with the locals. Celts also settled in the southern parts of Bessarabia, their main city being Aliobrix.  The first polity that is believed to have included the whole of Bessarabia was the Dacian polity of Burebista in the 1st century BC. After his death, the polity was divided into smaller pieces, and the central parts were unified in the Dacian kingdom of Decebalus in the 1st century AD. This kingdom was defeated by the Roman Empire in 106. Southern Bessarabia was included in the empire even before that, in 57 AD, as part of the Roman province Moesia Inferior, but it was secured only when the Dacian Kingdom was defeated in 106. The Romans built defensive earthen walls in Southern Bessarabia (e.g. Lower Trajan Wall) to defend the Scythia Minor province against invasions. Except for the Black Sea shore in the south, Bessarabia remained outside direct Roman control; the myriad of tribes there are called by modern historians Free Dacians. The 2nd to the 5th centuries also saw the development of the Chernyakhov culture.  In 270, the Roman authorities began to withdraw their forces south of the Danube, especially from the Roman Dacia, due to the invading Goths and Carpi. The Goths, a Germanic tribe, poured into the Roman Empire from the lower Dniepr River, through the southern part of Bessarabia (Budjak steppe), which due to its geographic position and characteristics (mainly steppe), was swept by various nomadic tribes for many centuries. In 378, the area was overrun by the Huns.  Early Middle Ages   From the 3rd century until the 11th century, the region was invaded numerous times in turn by different tribes: Goths, Huns, Avars, Bulgars, Magyars, Pechenegs, Cumans and Mongols. The territory of Bessarabia was encompassed in dozens of ephemeral kingdoms which were disbanded when another wave of migrants arrived. Those centuries were characterized by a terrible state of insecurity and mass movement of these tribes. The period was later known as the \"Dark Ages\" of Europe, or Age of migrations.  In 561, the Avars captured Bessarabia and executed the local ruler Mesamer. Following the Avars, Slavs arrived in the region and established settlements. Then, in 582, Onogur Bulgars settled in southeastern Bessarabia and northern Dobruja, from which they moved to Moesia Inferior (allegedly under pressure from the Khazars), and formed the nascent region of Bulgaria. With the rise of the Khazars' state in the east, the invasions began to diminish and it was possible to create larger states. According to some opinions, the southern part of Bessarabia remained under the influence of the First Bulgarian Empire until the end of the 9th century.  Between the 8th and 10th centuries, the southern part of Bessarabia was inhabited by people from the Balkan-Danubian culture (the culture of the First Bulgarian Empire). Between the 9th and 13th centuries, Bessarabia is mentioned in Slav chronicles as part of Bolohoveni (north) and Brodnici (south) voivodeships, believed to be Vlach principalities of the early Middle Ages.  The last large-scale invasions were those of the Mongols of 1241, 1290, and 1343. Sehr al-Jedid (near Orhei), an important settlement of the Golden Horde, dates from this period. They led to a retreat of a big part of the population to the mountainous areas in Eastern Carpathians and to Transylvania. The population east of Prut became especially low at the time of the Tatar invasions.  In the Late Middle Age, chronicles mention a Tigheci \"republic\", predating the establishment of the Principality of Moldavia, situated near the modern town of Cahul in the southwest of Bessarabia, preserving its autonomy even during the later Principality even into the 18th century. Genovese merchants rebuilt or established a number of forts along Dniester (notably Moncastro) and Danube (including Kyliya/Chilia-Licostomo).  Principality of Moldavia   After the 1360s the region was gradually included in the principality of Moldavia, which by 1392 established control over the fortresses of Akkerman and Chilia, its eastern border becoming the River Dniester. Based on the name of the region, some authors consider that in the latter part of the 14th century the southern part of the region was under the rule of Wallachia (the ruling dynasty of Wallachia during that period was called Basarab). In the 15th century, the entire region was a part of the principality of Moldavia. Stephen the Great ruled between 1457 and 1504, a period of nearly 50 years during which he won 32 battles defending his country against virtually all his neighbours (mainly the Ottomans and the Tatars, but also the Hungarians and the Poles) while losing only two. During this period, after each victory, he raised a monastery or a church close to the battlefield honoring Christianity. Many of these battlefields and churches, as well as old fortresses, are situated in Bessarabia (mainly along Dniester).  In 1484, the Turks invaded and captured Chilia and Cetatea Alb\u0103 (Akkerman in Turkish), and annexed the shoreline southern part of Bessarabia, which was then divided into two sanjaks (districts) of the Ottoman Empire. In 1538, the Ottomans annexed more Bessarabian land in the south as far as Tighina, while the central and northern Bessarabia remained part of the Principality of Moldavia (which became a vassal of the Ottoman Empire). Between 1711 and 1812, the Russian Empire occupied the region five times during its wars against Ottoman and Austrian Empires.  Annexation by the Russian Empire   By the Treaty of Bucharest of May 28, 1812\u2014concluding the Russo-Turkish War, 1806-1812\u2014the Ottoman Empire ceded the land between the Pruth and the Dniester, including both Moldavian and Turkish territories, to the Russian Empire. That entire region was then called Bessarabia.  In 1814, the first German settlers arrived and mainly settled in the southern parts, and Bessarabian Bulgarians began settling in the region too, founding towns such as Bolhrad. Between 1812 and 1846, the Bulgarian and Gagauz population migrated to the Russian Empire via the River Danube, after living many years under oppressive Ottoman rule, and settled in southern Bessarabia. Turkic-speaking tribes of the Nogai horde also inhabited the Budjak Region (in Turkish Bucak) of southern Bessarabia from the 16th to 18th centuries but were totally driven out prior to 1812.  Administratively, Bessarabia became an oblast of the Russian Empire in 1818, and a guberniya in 1873.  By the Treaty of Adrianople that concluded the Russo-Turkish War of 1828-1829 the entire Danube Delta was added to the Bessarabian oblast. According to Vasile Stoica, emissary of the Romanian government to the United States, in 1834, the Romanian language was banned from schools and government facilities, despite 80% of the population speaking the language. This would eventually lead to the banning of Romanian in churches, media, and books. According to the same author, those who protested the banning of Romanian could be sent to Siberia.  Southern Bessarabia returned to Moldavia At the end of the Crimean War, in 1856, by the Treaty of Paris, Southern Bessarabia (organised as the Cahul and Ismail counties, with the Bolgrad county split from the latter in 1864) was returned to Moldavia, causing the Russian Empire to lose access to the Danube river.  In 1859, Moldavia and Wallachia united to form the Romanian United Principalities (Romania), which included the southern part of Bessarabia.  The railway Chi\u0219in\u0103u-Ia\u0219i was opened on June 1, 1875, in preparation for the Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878) and the Eiffel Bridge was opened on , just three days before the outbreak of the war. The Romanian War of Independence was fought in 1877\u201378, with the help of the Russian Empire as an ally. Northern Dobruja was awarded to Romania for its role in the 1877\u201378 Russo-Turkish War, and as compensation for the transfer of Southern Bessarabia.  Early 20th century  The Kishinev pogrom took place in the capital of Bessarabia on April 6, 1903, after local newspapers published articles inciting the public to act against Jews; 47 or 49 Jews were killed, 92 severely wounded and 700 houses destroyed. The anti-Semitic newspaper \u0411\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0435\u0446 (Bessarabetz, meaning \"Bessarabian\"), published by Pavel Krushevan, insinuated that local Jews killed a Russian boy. Another newspaper, \u0421\u0432\u0435\u0442 (Lat. Svet, meaning \"World\" or Russian for \"Light\"), used the age-old blood libel against the Jews (alleging that the boy had been killed to use his blood in preparation of matzos).  After the 1905 Russian Revolution, a Romanian nationalist movement started to develop in Bessarabia. In the chaos brought by the Russian revolution of October 1917, a National Council (Sfatul \u021a\u0103rii) was established in Bessarabia, with 120 members elected from Bessarabia by some political and professional organizations and 10 elected from Transnistria (the left bank of Dniester where Moldovans and Romanians accounted for less than a third and the majority of the population was Ukrainian. See Demographics of Transdniestria).  The Rumcherod Committee (Central Executive Committee of the Soviets of Romanian Front, Black Sea Fleet and Odessa Military District) proclaimed itself the supreme power in Bessarabia.  On the pretext of securing supply lines against raids by Bolsheviks and armed bandits, members of the Moldavian legislative council Sfatul \u021a\u0103rii and the Entente Powers requested military assistance from Romania, and the Romanian Army crossed the republic's border on ; following several skirmishes with Moldovan and Bolshevik troops, the occupation of the whole region was completed in early March. The occupation of Bessarabia by the Romanians was not universally welcomed, and the members of the Bessarabian government denied that the Romanian troops had ever been invited to occupy the republic.  After Ukraine issued its Fourth Universal, breaking ties with Bolshevik Russia and proclaiming a sovereign Ukrainian state, Sfatul \u021a\u0103rii declared Bessarabia's independence on January 24, 1918, as the Moldavian Democratic Republic.  Unification with Romania   On March 5 [O.S. 20 February] 1918, in a secret agreement signed along the Treaty of Buftea, the German Empire allowed Romania to annex Bessarabia in exchange for free passage of German troops toward Ukraine. The county councils of B\u0103l\u021bi, Soroca and Orhei were the earliest to ask for unification of the Moldavian Democratic Republic with the Kingdom of Romania, and on April 9 [O.S. March 27] 1918, in the presence of the Romanian Army, The Country Council, called \"Sfatul \u021a\u0103rii\", voted in favour of the union, with the following conditions:   The Country Council would undertake an agrarian reform, which the Romanian Government would accept.  Bessarabia would remain autonomous, with its own diet, the Country Council, elected democratically  The Country Council would vote for local budgets, control the councils of the zemstva and cities, and appoint the local administration  Conscription would be done on a territorial basis  Local laws and the form of administration could be changed only with the approval of local representatives  The rights of minorities had to be respected  Two Bessarabian representatives would be part of the Romanian government  Bessarabia would send to the Romanian Parliament a number of representatives equal to the proportion of its population  All elections must involve a direct, equal, secret, and universal vote  Freedom of speech and of belief must be guaranteed in the constitution  All individuals who had committed felonies for political reasons during the revolution would be amnestied.  86 deputies voted in support, three voted against and 36 abstained. The Romanian prime minister at the time, Alexandru Marghiloman, would later admit that the union was decided in Bucharest and Ia\u0219i, the seats of the Romanian government.  The first condition, the agrarian reform, was debated and approved in November 1918. The Country Council also decided to remove the other conditions and made unification with Romania unconditional. The legality of this vote was considered highly debatable since the meeting had not been publicly announced, there was no quorum (only 44 of the 125 members took part in it, mostly Moldavian conservatives), and then the Country Council voted for its self-dissolution, preventing the protests of the Moldavians and minorities members who had not participated in the parliamentary session from being taken into account.  In the autumn of 1919, elections for the Romanian Constituent Assembly were held in Bessarabia; 90 deputies and 35 senators were chosen. On December 20, 1919, these men voted, along with the representatives of Romania's other regions, to ratify the unification acts that had been approved by the Country Council and the National Congresses in Transylvania and Bukovina.  The union was recognized by France, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Japan in the Treaty of Paris of 1920. However, the treaty never came into force, as Japan did not ratify it. The United States refused to sign the treaty on the grounds that Russia was not represented at the Conference. The US also considered Bessarabia a territory under Romanian occupation, rather than Romanian territory, despite existing political and economic relations between the US and Romania. Soviet Russia (and later, the USSR) did not recognize the union, and by 1924, after its demands for a regional plebiscite were declined by Romania for the second time, declared Bessarabia to be Soviet territory under foreign occupation. On all Soviet maps, Bessarabia was highlighted as territory not belonging to Romania.  Aftermath A Provisional Workers' & Peasants' Government of Bessarabia was founded on May 5, 1919, in exile at Odessa, by the Bolsheviks.  On May 11, 1919, the Bessarabian Soviet Socialist Republic was proclaimed as an autonomous part of Russian SFSR, but was abolished by the military forces of Poland and France in September 1919 (see Polish\u2013Soviet War). After the victory of Bolshevist Russia in the Russian Civil War, the Ukrainian SSR was created in 1922, and in 1924 the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was established on a strip of Ukrainian land on the west bank of Dniester where Moldovans and Romanians accounted for less than a third and the relative majority of the population was Ukrainian. (See Demographics of the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic).  Part of Romania  Historiography Svetlana Suveic\u0103 considers that historical discourse regarding interwar Bessarabia was heavily influenced by the political association of the authors, and sought mainly to argue for or against the legality of Romanian rule in Bessarabia. The impact of the various reforms on the progress of the province was mostly ignored.  Romanian historiography, for the most part, consistently sought to demonstrate the legitimacy of the regime established after the Union of Bessarabia with Romania. During the interwar period, Romanian historians countered Soviet historians' description of it as the establishment of an \"occupation regime\". The agrarian reform, considered one of the most radical in Europe (an idea also supported by Western historians), was appreciated as having a positive role, emphasizing the national emancipation of the Romanian peasantry, while the modernization of agriculture was presented as a complex phenomenon, which also required further mechanism to support the new owner. However, agriculture was ignored by the state, and the new owners were greatly affected by the lack of credit, Romanian authors of the time suggested various ways this situation could have been overcome. Ultimately, as the state failed to create an adequate agricultural policy, by the end of the 1920 authors were hoping progress could be made through private initiative. Romanian authors also paid particular attention to the unification of administrative legislation, norms, and principles of administrative law, as well as their application in Romanian practice. The institute of the zemstvo was regarded by some of them as the most democratic form of government, and its dissolution by the Romanian authorities was deplored; authors such as Onisifor Ghibu expressed a critical view on the relation between Romanian administrative personnel from outside Bessarabia and the locals, as well as the general structure of the administrative corps.  During the Communist period, Romanian historians initially treated the reforms applied after World War I mainly from social class perspectives. Starting with the 1960s, the first studies that mentioned the existence of a \"Bessarabian historical problem\" appeared. From the second half of the 1970s, studies on the agrarian reform considered that while this led to a \"natural and rational distribution of agricultural property\", it also led to fragmentation of agricultural land. This made the practice of intensive agriculture difficult, since peasants had reduced opportunity to purchase agricultural equipment. Towards the end of the Communist period, the two interwar concepts of development and modernization were re-embraced.  After the fall of Communism, Romanian historiography treated Bessarabia mainly in the context of Romanian nation-building, seen as the main issue affecting Greater Romania; authors focused mainly on issues related to the general and specific context of Bessarabia after the Union, the state's efforts for social-political and economic integration, and cultural development of Bessarabia. The internal and external factors that determined the specifics of the province's integration into the Romanian common framework are also of interest. Romanian authors mainly blamed the lasting effects of Russian domination and the destabilizing role of Soviet Russia (USSR) for the malfunctioning of the Romanian administration, with some also pointing to the difficult and non-uniform character of the integration generated by the non-uniform character of the development of the provinces until 1918, of a different degree of their adaptability to the new conditions. The modernization interwar period is also seen as the third phase of a continuous process, begun in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and brutally interrupted by the establishment of Communism. In this context, some authors consider the comparative studies of the interwar and post-Communist periods in different fields as particularly current.  Soviet historiography considered the changes that took place in interwar Bessarabia expressed were directed either towards strengthening the political, economical, and social position of the bourgeoisie, to the detriment of the peasantry, or towards creating a favourable position for the Romanian population, to the detriment of the national minorities; Soviet authors thus reportedly rejected the notion that any modernization and progress took place in the region during Romanian rule. The transformations that took place on different levels of the Bessarabian society at that time were treated from a social class and/or ethnopolitical positions; Svetlana Suveic\u0103 states \"the writings from the Soviet period, directly determined by the interference of politics in historical science, alternated the ideas regarding the \"Moldovan\" nation and the national identity, with severe condemnations of the Romanian interwar period\". In Suveic\u0103's opinion, the conception of Soviet historiography was based on distorted facts that would serve as \"indisputable arguments\" for the establishment of an illegal \"occupation\" regime. According to Wim P. van Meurs \"the legitimation of the political regime has been the main function of (the Soviet) historiography and such a legitimation has usually been based on a number of historical myths\". The discussion of the social-economic and politico-administrative situation in the region was also closely related to the Romanian-Soviet conflictual relations of the 1960s and 1970s, during which both communist countries treated the Bessarabian problem for political purposes.  The presence of the ideological factor in writing the history of Bessarabia was manifested itself not only at the central level, but also at the level of the historiography of Soviet Moldavia. It was not until the second half of the '80s that the Moldovan historiography raised the issue of the Soviet political and ideological pressures.  After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Moldovan historiography, largely marked by the public identity discourse, deals with the problems of the interwar Bessarabian history, depending on the context. On the one hand, the supporters of the idea of Moldovan statehood reject the option of modernization and progress of Bessarabia after the Union with Romania while, on the other hand, the historians who, starting from the idea of the Romanian character of Bessarabia, and using new sources, \"contribute to the in-depth knowledge of the integrating and modernizing processes that marked the history of the (Bessarabian) land in the interwar period\". This ongoing controversy highlights the two antagonistic geopolitical tendencies present in the contemporary Moldovan historiography: the pro-East current versus the pro-West current.  The Western historiography pointed out that the reforms at the beginning of Romania's rule were mainly directed at easing the social tensions existing across Easter Europe and were, therefore, similar to the ones taking place elsewhere in the region. In the case of the agrarian reform, G. Clenton Logio states that the Romanians were pressed into legislating it, as expropriation had begun before the Union and there was the danger that Bessarabians would undo this act; he notes that no planning took place regarding the effects of the reform and the problems of the peasantry were ignored, transforming the latter in \"a numerous and profitable mass of clients for the banks\". According to the analysis Western authors, the reform only changed the distribution of the land, and not agricultural policies; as a result of the economical and social policies of the Romanian governments, small and medium-sized farms remained unprofitable, while the large farms not affected by the reform also lost their economic role. Western authors also criticized the administrative corps of Bessarabia - \"an unstable and corrupt stratum\" - observing that transfer of administrative personnel from Romania to Bessarabia was regarded as a severe punishment, and the clerks affected generally sought personal enrichment; the local administration was also considered rigid and unwilling to reform. In general, Western historiography analyzed the modernization of Bessarabia in a general Romanian context in relation to the previous Russian period, as well as the uneven and not so fast modernization process, determined by both internal and external factors.  Overview According to Vladimir Solonar and Vladimir Bruter, Bessarabia under Romanian rule experienced low population growth due to high mortality (highest in Romania and one of the highest in Europe) as well as emigration; Bessarabia was also characterized by economic stagnation and high unemployment. Access to social services declined after the abolition of the zemstvos in the early 1920s, as these had previously provided local autonomy in managing education and public health. In the late 1930s, the Bessarabian population had among the highest incidences of several major infectious diseases and some of the highest mortality rates from these diseases.  According to Dan Dungaciu, the only European modernization process of Bessarabia was carried out during the Romanian interwar period, despite the all unfavorable domestic and international conditions (post-war recession, actions backed by the Soviet Union, worldwide Great Depression). Gheorghe Duca considers that, in terms of science, economy, art, political and social life, Bessarabia made considerable progress in the interwar period.  Nicolae Enciu appreciates that, through the political, social-economic, and cultural modernization, the interwar period meant a progress of the Romanian society, with beneficial effects in all its historical regions. At the same time, the interwar period also experienced failures, being too short to be able to produce radical transformations, in order to reduce the economic and social polarization.  Politics According to Wim P. van Meurs, after 1918 Bessarabia remained for a long time in a state of emergency, under a military administration, due to border incidents and agitation among the peasantry and the minorities. Strict censorship was imposed in order to restrain Bolshevik propaganda. Three major revolts or Soviet raids took place in the province during the first decade of Romanian rule. In January 1919, local peasants, with support from across the Dniester, rebelled against the Romanian army in the area of Hotin. A similar uprising took place later that year in Tighina. While in the first case Soviet participation is not documented, the latter was probably a Soviet raid, though van Meurs indicates it was most likely a local initiative not coordinated with the central government in Moscow. The longest-lasting rebellion took place for several weeks in 1924 in the area of Tatarbunary when the local population was instigated by agitators from the Soviet Union and proclaimed a Bessarabian Soviet Republic. In all cases, the rebellions were brutally suppressed by the Romanian army, which at times fielded artillery against the rebels.  According to Anatol Petrencu, during the most of the Romanian period, Bessarabia benefited by democracy, with a multiparty and a modern electoral system, based on the 1923 Constitution and laws. In November 1919, Romania elected the first post-war parliament based on the proportional representation of the mandates according to the number of the population. As of mid 1919, the population of Bessarabia was estimated at around 2 million. With a voter turnout of 72.2%, the Bessarabians elected and sent to the Romanian Parliament 90 deputies and 37 senators.  According to Charles King, in Romania \"the budding democracy [...] was soon crushed beneath the weight of corruption, court intrigues, and right-wing reaction\". The same author notes that corrupt and heavy-handed Romanian administrators were especially prevalent in the region, and the Siguran\u021ba, the Romanian secret police, conducted extensive surveillance among the minorities and regarded Transnistrian refugees and Bessarabian students as potential Bolshevik agents. This resulted in \"a sense among locals that Bessarabia had been occupied by Romania rather than united with\". Russians, in particular, were regarded as \"Bolsheviks in disguise\", with their churches and libraries closed down or Romanianized.  Economy At the beginning of World War I, around 80% of the population worked in agriculture. While the Sfatul \u021a\u0103rii envisioned distributing land freely to the peasants, Romanian pressure resulted in a significant modification of the plans, bringing the reform more in line with similar ones taking place in the Old Kingdom and Transylvania. While more radical than elsewhere, as it provided lower payments, lower limits for land exempt from expropriation and larger plots, the Romanian land reform also reverted some of the ad-hoc land distribution that had taken place during the Russian Revolution, raising discontent among the peasantry. Thus, of the 1.5 million dessiatin (40% of the agricultural land) held by the large landowners in 1917, more than one third (38.6%) was distributed to peasants, another third was restored to its previous owners, while the rest became state property and was to a large degree later awarded to officers of the Romanian army, officials and clergy. A significant number of plots were awarded to Romanians immigrants from Wallachia and Western Moldavia, while Romanian offices who married Bessarabian women were eligible to receive 100 hectares. Though the reform set the lot at 6 hectares, more than two-thirds of the peasant households received less than 5 hectares each, and, as of 1931, 367.8 thousand peasant families were still landless. The average size of the peasant household further dropped after the land reform due to land division among heirs.  According to Alla Skvortsova, while the reform stimulated the development of commodity farming in the countryside and expanded the market for industrial products, it failed to produce the expected results. The peasants had to pay for the land they received during the following 20 years, there was little to no state support provided for them to acquire technical equipment required for the development of successful farms and credit was only accessible to the more prosperous among them and therefore insignificant overall. The region also lacked qualified specialists and lagged behind in infrastructure, as the government had few resources and other priorities. The main factors which impeded the creation of a prosperous peasant class were the payments for land redemption, peasant debts, and taxes, lack of access to the traditional Russian market, difficulties to break into the Romanian and European agricultural market and frequent droughts (1921, 1924, 1925, 1927\u201328 and 1935). Winemaking, one of the mainstays of the local economy, was particularly affected by the external policy of the Romanian state: the most favoured nation status awarded to France brought inexpensive French wine to the local market, access to the Soviet market was blocked, while exports to the traditional markets in Poland were hindered by the trade war started in 1926.  According to Alla Skvortsova, the peasant situation was further aggravated by the Great Depression in Romania, with prices for agricultural products dropping catastrophically and not recovering until the end of the decade. While only 2.8% of the national agricultural credit was directed by the National Bank of Romania towards Bessarabia in 1936, by 1940 70% of the peasants were in debt to the large landowners and moneylenders. In order to pay debts, many of the poorer peasants had to sell their livestock and even their land. Failure to pay the redemption payments for 2.5 years also resulted in the land reverting to state property; thus, by 1938, in the district of Soroca only a quarter of the peasant households had retained their allotment. By 1939 farms of up to 5 hectares throughout the region had lost a seventh of their land, while farms with more than 10 hectares had increased their land by 26%. According to a study of the new Soviet administration, in June 1940 7.3% of the peasant households in the Bessarabian regions of the Moldavian SSR were completely landless, 38.15% had up to 3 hectares (an average of 1.7 hectares per lot) and 22.4% had 3 to 5 hectares (an average of 2.6 hectares per one household), i.e. more than two-thirds of the peasant households were farm laborers and poor peasants. Better off was the middle peasantry, which owned 5 to 10 hectares, and constituted 22.73% of peasant farms. The rest, constituting 9.4% of the farms, owned more than 10 hectares each, but held under their control 36% of peasant land, i.e. more than all small farms taken together. The 818 large landowners held an average of 100 hectares each, while institutional owners (the state, churches, and monasteries) held another 59 thousand hectares. About 54% of peasant households had no livestock, about two-thirds had no horse, a little more than a sixth had one horse each, and only 13.2% had two or more working horses. In the whole of Bessarabian region of the Moldavian SSR there were at the beginning of Soviet administration only 219 obsolete tractors, mostly owned by larger farms and used primarily as threshing engines. With little serviceable equestrian equipment, tillage, sowing, and harvesting of all crops were mostly carried out manually. Throughout the interwar era, Bessarabia witnessed several negative phenomena: further social stratification in the countryside, deepening poverty, lowering yields, worsening of the structure of crops grown, reduction of the total agricultural production. The number of cattle fell by 26% between 1926 and 1938, the number of sheep by 5%, the number of pigs by 14%. Average grain yield also decreased from 1920/1925 to 1935/1939 from 850\u00a0kg per hectare to 800\u00a0kg. The area used in wine-making grew by 15,000 hectares between 1930 and 1938. However, wine quality dropped, as slightly over 80% of the vineyards were planted with lower quality grape varieties. According to V.I. Tsaranov, adding to the lack of land, small plots, poor crop yields, unemployment was also high among rural residents, with around 550 thousand recorded in June 1940.  According to Alla Skvortsova, the Romanian government, either directly or through the banking system, encouraged the development of industry in the areas of prewar Romania, while hindering the process in new territories. As a consequence, even Bessarabian entrepreneurs preferred to invest their capital in those areas instead of using it within the region. Local industry faced fierce competition from larger Romanian companies, which had access to preferential rail tariffs, limited credit to local entrepreneurs, and flooded the local market with cheaper industrial goods produced in Romania or imported from abroad. Nevertheless, some new small-scale industrial enterprises were established in the 1920s, using primarily local raw materials and producing for the local market. The total engine power rose from 7.8 thousand hp in 1925 to 12.2 thousand in 1929. Although the number of industrial enterprises more than doubled after 1918, small semi-handicraft production prevailed, seldomly using hired labor: in 1930 there were an average of only 2.4 employees per enterprise. During the 22 years of Romanian rule, only one large enterprise was built in Bessarabia: the B\u0103l\u021bi sugar plant.  According to Alla Skvortsova, not all new enterprises survived for long, and the Great Depression had a particularly strong impact on the region, many of the companies going bankrupt or closing in 1929\u20131933. Governmental policy, influenced by the banking system and the industrial cartels, prevented a rebound, the industry of the Old Kingdom again receiving preferential treatment. The main factors that affected the development of Bessarabia in the 1930s were severe credit restrictions, increases in transport tariffs and customs restrictions, and special tax policies. The tax burden was notably high, with enterprises required to fully provide the assigned tax agent with housing, heating, lighting, and office space. Bessarabia was reduced mostly to a supplier of raw materials and a market for industrial goods of Romanian or foreign origin. By the end of the 1930s, the only industrial sectors that managed to rebound were the food and woodworking industries, the rest witnessing either stagnation or a decrease compared to pre-Depression levels. Most industrial facilities in the food industry worked significantly below their installed capacity even in prosperous years such as 1937. Several large factories, such as the Basarabeasca, Cetatea Alb\u0103, Flore\u0219ti and Tighina, railway workshops, the Cetatea Alb\u0103 and Chi\u0219in\u0103u textile and knitwear factories and the Cetatea Alb\u0103 canning factory and distillery were dismantled and relocated to the Old Kingdom by 1938. Between 1929 and 1937, fixed capital in the industry dropped by 10%, and the number of industrial workers in Bessarabia dropped from 5,400 in 1925 to 3,500 in 1937, while their overall number in Romania had increased by almost 27% during the same period. Between 1926 and 1937 the share of the food industry in the total production of large manufacturing industries increased from 77.1% to 92.4%, with sharp decreases observed in sectors with higher added value, such as the metalworking, textile and leather processing industries. Even so, the food industry failed to fulfill local needs; most industries heavily relied on manual labor and primitive technologies. Electricity production in Chi\u0219in\u0103u, Bessarabia's center and Romania's second-largest city, recorded in 1925 at 4.47 million kWh, only increased by 6.7% during the following decade, lagging far behind other Romanian cities: 572.3% in Gala\u021bi, 238.2% in Bucharest, and over 101% in Ia\u0219i. By the end of the 1930s, only one in seven Bessarabians had access to electricity, compared to one in four among the general Romanian population.  The Romanian administration carried out many projects aimed at improving the infrastructure of the province to introduce European gauge and reorient it towards Romania. The total length of the railway lines in Bessarabia increased only by 78\u00a0km (from 1140 in 1918 to 1218 in 1940). Local businessmen remained dissatisfied with the pace of the construction of new railways (the Chi\u0219in\u0103u-C\u0103inari was the only one built anew) and the closure of a number of lines. Road infrastructure was also improved, as new highways and bridges over the Prut were built, while part of the existing roads were repaired and paved, increasing the length of highways from 150 to 754\u00a0km. However, most other roads remained impassable during rainy periods. Shipping on the Dniester was closed, and was never established on the Prut. In the 1930s, new airports were built, telephone lines were laid out, and radio transmitters were installed; nevertheless, the region still lagged behind Transylvania and the Old Kingdom.  According to Alla Skvortsova, overall, the share of Bessarabian enterprises in the Romanian industry fell between 1919 and 1937 from 9% to 5.7%, while the number of enterprises employing at least 20 employees dropping from 262 to 196. The share of investments in Bessarabian industry also fell from 0.3% in 1923 to 0.1% in 1936. Sociologist T. Al. \u015etirbu observed, commenting on the Romanian government's apparent long-term economical plans, that \"Bessarabia can only be considered as a reserve of labor and cheap bread for the industry of the rest of the country\". In a 1938 review, the Bessarabian Federation of Chambers of Commerce noted that \"the decline in industrial production in Bessarabia hinders the rational processing of local raw materials, thereby turning our province into a colony for industry in the rest of the country\". According to V.I. Tsaranov, throughout the period, industrial workers in the region faced long working hours (up to fourteen per day), lack of proper safety measures, unsanitary conditions, the perspective of unemployment and a general decrease in the standard of living: the real wage of a Chi\u0219in\u0103u worker dropped 60% between 1913 and 1937.  Education In 1919, Bessarabia became the Romanian region with the highest illiteracy rate. Although the Romanian/Moldovan population was the largest, no Romanian language school operated in Bessarabia before 1918. As a result, among them, only 10.5% of men and 1.77% of women were literate. By 1930, although Bessarabia continued to be the region with the most illiterate people in Romania, the number of literates doubled, to 38,1% of the total population. In the 1920-1938 period, the number of primary schools increased from 1,747 to 2,718, and the number of students from 136,172 to 346,747. In 1940, there were also 24 gymnasiums and middle schools and 26 high schools. Despite a large number of minorities (over 870,000 Russians, Ukrainians, and Jews), education in minority languages was curtailed: private schools were allowed to function after 1925 only if the instruction was in Romanian and, by 1938, there were no state-  sponsored Russian or Ukrainian schools and only one each in private hands. In 1939, after the German and Soviet attacks on Poland, the government reverted on its earlier policy and decided to reintroduce minority language classes in state schools and allow a greater degree of cultural expression for the Slavic minorities, in an effort to improve its image among the local population.  Also, in the interwar period, the foundations were laid for the first higher education institutions in Bessarabia. In 1926, the Faculty of Theology was established in Chi\u0219in\u0103u, followed by the National Conservatory in 1928, and the Faculty of Agricultural Sciences in 1933. The two faculties were sections of the University of Ia\u0219i, in pre-war Romania.  World War II   The Soviet Union did not recognize the incorporation of Bessarabia into Romania and throughout the entire interwar period engaged in attempts to undermine Romania and diplomatic disputes with the government in Bucharest over this territory. The Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact was signed on August 23, 1939. By Article 4 of the secret Annex to the Treaty, Nazi Germany recognized Bessarabia as belonging to the Soviet \"sphere of interest\".  In the spring of 1940, Western Europe was overrun by Germany. With world attention focused on those events, on June 26, 1940, the USSR issued a 24-hour ultimatum to Romania, demanding immediate cession of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina under threat of war. Romania was given four days to evacuate its troops and officials. The two provinces had an area of , and were inhabited by about 3.75 million people, half of them Romanians, according to official Romanian sources. Two days later, Romania yielded and began evacuation. During the evacuation, from June 28 to July 3, groups of local Communists and Soviet sympathizers attacked the retreating forces and civilians who chose to leave. Many members of the minorities (Jews, ethnic Ukrainians and others) joined in these attacks. The Romanian Army was also attacked by the Soviet Army, which entered Bessarabia before the Romanian administration finished retreating. The casualties reported by the Romanian Army during those seven days consisted of 356 officers and 42,876 soldiers dead or missing.  On August 2, the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic was established on most of the territory of Bessarabia, merged with the western parts of the former Moldavian ASSR. Bessarabia was divided between the Moldavian SSR (65% of the territory and 80% of the population) and the Ukrainian SSR. Bessarabia's northern and southern districts (now Budjak and parts of the Chernivtsi oblast) were allotted to Ukraine, while some territories (4,000\u00a0km2) on the left (eastern) bank of Dniester (present Transnistria), previously part of Ukraine, were allotted to Moldavia. Following the Soviet takeover, many Bessarabians, who were accused of supporting the deposed Romanian administration, were executed or deported to Siberia and Kazakhstan.  Between September and November 1940, the ethnic Germans of Bessarabia were offered resettlement to Germany, following a German-Soviet agreement. Fearing Soviet oppression, almost all Germans (93,000) agreed. Most of them were resettled to the newly annexed Polish territories.  On June 22, 1941 the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union commenced with Operation Barbarossa. Between June 22 and July 26, 1941, Romanian troops recovered Bessarabia and northern Bukovina with the help of Wehrmacht. The Soviets employed scorched earth tactics during their forced retreat from Bessarabia, destroying the infrastructure and transporting movable goods to Russia by railway. At the end of July, after a year of Soviet rule, the region was once again under Romanian control, being organized as the Bessarabia Governorate.  As the military operation was still in progress, there were cases of Romanian troops \"taking revenge\" on Jews in Bessarabia, in the form of pogroms on civilians and murder of Jewish POWs, resulting in several thousand dead. The supposed cause for murdering Jews was that in 1940 some Jews welcomed the Soviet takeover as liberation. At the same time the notorious SS Einsatzgruppe D, operating in the area of the German 11th Army, committed summary executions of Jews under the pretext that they were spies, saboteurs, Communists, or under no pretext whatsoever.  The political solution of the \"Jewish Question\" was apparently seen by the Romanian dictator Marshal Ion Antonescu more in expulsion rather than extermination. That portion of the Jewish population of Bessarabia and Bukovina which did not flee before the retreat of the Soviet troops (147,000) was initially gathered into ghettos or Nazi concentration camps, and then deported during 1941\u20131942 in death marches into Romanian-occupied Transnistria, where the \"Final Solution\" was applied.  After three years of relative peace, the German-Soviet front returned in 1944 to the land border on the Dniester. On August 20, 1944, a c. 3,400,000-strong Red Army began a major summer offensive codenamed Second Jassy\u2013Kishinev offensive. The Soviet armies overran Bessarabia in a two-pronged offensive within five days. In pocket battles at Chi\u0219in\u0103u and S\u0103rata the German 6th Army of  650,000 men, newly reformed after the Battle of Stalingrad, was obliterated. Simultaneously with the success of the Russian attack, Romania broke the military alliance with the Axis and changed sides. On August 23, 1944, Marshal Ion Antonescu was arrested by King Michael, and later handed over to the Soviets.  Part of the Soviet Union   The Soviet Union regained the region in 1944, and the Red Army occupied Romania. By 1947, the Soviets had imposed a communist government in Bucharest, which was friendly and obedient towards Moscow. The Soviet occupation of Romania lasted until 1958. The Romanian communist regime did not openly raise the matter of Bessarabia or Northern Bukovina in its diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. At least 100,000 people died in a post-war famine in Moldavia.  Between 1969 and 1971, a clandestine National Patriotic Front was established by several young intellectuals in Chi\u0219in\u0103u, totaling over 100 members, vowing to fight for the establishment of a Moldavian Democratic Republic, its secession from the Soviet Union and union with Romania.  In December 1971, following an informative note from , the President of the Council of State Security of the Romanian Socialist Republic, to Yuri Andropov, the chief of KGB, three of the leaders of the National Patriotic Front, Alexandru Usatiuc-Bulgar, Gheorghe Ghimpu and Valeriu Graur, as well as a fourth person, Alexandru Soltoianu, the leader of a similar clandestine movement in northern Bukovina (Bucovina), were arrested and later sentenced to long prison terms.  Rise of independent Moldova   With the weakening of the Soviet Union, in February 1988, the first non-sanctioned demonstrations were held in Chi\u0219in\u0103u. At first pro-Perestroika, they soon turned anti-government and demanded official status for the Romanian (Moldavian) language instead of the Russian language. On August 31, 1989, following a 600,000-strong demonstration in Chi\u0219in\u0103u four days earlier, Romanian (Moldavian) became the official language of the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic. However, this was not implemented for many years. In 1990, the first free elections were held for Parliament, with the opposition Popular Front winning them. A government led by Mircea Druc, one of the leaders of the Popular Front, was formed. The Moldavian SSR became SSR Moldova, and later the Republic of Moldova. The Republic of Moldova became independent on August 31, 1991; it took over unchanged the boundaries of the Moldavian SSR.  Population  According to Bessarabian historian \u0218tefan Ciobanu and Moldovan philologist Viorica R\u0103ileanu, in 1810, the Romanian (Moldavian) population was approximately 95%. During the 19th century, as a result of the Russian policy of colonization and Russification, the Romanian population decreased to (depending on data sources) 47.6% (in 1897), 52% or 75% for 1900 (Krusevan), 53.9% (1907), 70% (1912, Laskov), or 65\u201367% (1918, J. Kaba).  The Russian Census of 1817, which recorded 96,526 families and 482,630 inhabitants, did not register ethnic data except for recent refugees (primarily Bulgarians) and certain ethno-social categories (Jews, Armenians and Greeks). Official records indicated 3,826 Jewish families (4.2%), 1,200 Lipovan families (1.5%), 640 Greek families (0.7%), 530 Armenian families (0.6%), 482 Bulgarian and Gagauz families (0.5%). In the 20th century, Romanian historian Ion Nistor extrapolated the number of Romanians at 83,848 families (86%) and Ruthenians at 6,000 families (6.5%). The estimate was based on the assumption that Ruthenes constituted up to a third of the population of the Khotyn county, and the rest of the recorded population was exclusively Moldavian or Romanian. An alternative estimate for the same year indicates 76.4% Romanians, 8.7% Ukrainians, 5.1% Bulgarians and Gaguzes, 4.5% Jews and 2% Russians. An 1818 statistic of three counties in southern Bessarabia (Akkerman, Izmail and Bender) that had witnessed strong emigration of the Muslim population and immigration from other regions, including Ottoman lands south of the Danube, recorded a total population of 113,835. There are conflicting figures regarding the national distribution (first figure cited by Po\u0219tarencu, second by Ungureanu): 48.64/37% Moldavians, 7.07/8.9% Russians, 15.65/17.9% Ukrainians, 17.02/21.5% Bulgarians and 11.62/14.7% others. Still in 1818, statistics for the Khotyn county in northern Bessarabia indicated 47.5% Moldavians and 42.6% Ukrainians.  The Moldovan historian Ion Gumen\u00e2i records the population of Bessarabia in 1828 as 517,135, and states that 376,910 were Romanians (72.88%), 52,000 Ruthenians (10.05%), 30,929 Jews (5.9%), 8,846 Germans (1.71%), 7,947 Russians (1.53%), 5,974 Lipovans (1.15%), 2,384 Poles (0.46%), 2,000 Greeks (0.38%), 2,000 Armenians (0.38%), and 27,445 (5.3%) settlers in the south of Bessarabia.  The first statistic to record ethnic groups throughout Bessarabia was an incomplete administrative census made in 1843\u20131844 at the request of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The following proportions were recorded, in a total of 692,777 inhabitants: 59.4% Moldavians, 17.2% Ukrainians, 9.3% Bulgarians, 7.1% Jews, and 2.2% Russians. In the case of some urban centres, figures were not reported for all ethnic groups. Furthermore, the size of the total populations differs from other official reports of the same period, which put the population of Bessarabia at 774,492 or 793,103.  Church records gathered around 1850\u20131855 put the total population at 841,523, with the following composition: 51.4% Moldavians, 4.2% Russians, 21.3% Ukrainians, 10% Bulgarians, 7.2% Jews and 5.7% others. On the other hand, official data for 1855 record a total population of 980,031, excluding the population on the territory under the authority of the Special Administration of the town of Izmail.  According to Ion Nistor, the population of Bessarabia in 1856 was composed of 736,000 Romanians (74%), 119,000 Ukrainians (12%), 79,000 Jews (8%), 47,000 Bulgarians and Gagauz (5%), 24,000 Germans (2.4%), 11,000 Romani (1.1%), 6,000 Russians (0.6%), adding to a total of 990,274 inhabitants. Historian Constantin Ungureanu provides significantly different figures for the same year: 676,100 Romanians (68.2%), 126,000 Ukrainians (12.7%), 78,800 Jews (7.9%), 48,200 Bulgarians and Gaguz (4.9%), 24,200 (2.4%) Germans and 20,000 Russians (2%) for a total of 991,900.  Russian data, 1889 (Total: 1,628,867 inhabitants)  The Russian census in 1897 had a total of 1,935,412 inhabitants. By language:  920,919 Moldavians and Romanians (47.6%)  379,698 Ukrainians (19.6%)  228,168 Jews (11.8%)  155,774 Russians (8%)  103,225 Bulgarians (5.3%)  60,026 Germans (3.1%)  55,790 Turks (Gagauzes) (2.9%)  However, some scholars believed in regard to the 1897 census that \"[...] the census enumerator generally has instructions to count everyone who understands the state language as being of that nationality, no matter what his everyday speech may be\". Thus a number of Moldavians (Romanians) might have been registered as Russians.  According to N. Durnovo, the population of Bessarabia in 1900 was (1,935,000 inhabitants):  Notes: 1 The two counties were merged.  The Romanian estimates in 1919 (1922) gave a total populations of 2,631,000 inhabitants:   1,685,000 Romanians (64.0%)  254,000 Ukrainians (9.7%)  287,000 Jews (10.2%)  75,000 Russians (2.8%)  147,000 Bulgarians (5.6%)  79,000 Germans (3.0%)  59,000 Lipovans and Cossacks (2.2%)  67,000 Others (2.5%)  According to the 1930 Romanian census, the total population of Bessarabia was 2,864,662 inhabitants:  Notes: 1 Includes Lipovans. 2 Poles, Armenians, Albanians, Greeks, Gypsies, etc. and non-declared  The data of the Romanian census of 1939 was not completely processed before the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia. However, estimates had the total population rise to approximately 3.2 million.  The census of 1941, during the Romanian wartime administration (Total: 2,733,563 inhabitants):  1,793,493 Romanians (65.6%)  449,540 Ukrainians (16.4%)  177,647 Bulgarians (6.5%)  164,410 Russians (6.0%)  115,683 Gagauz (4.2%)  9,086 Poles (0.3%)  6,882 Jews (0.3%)  2,058 Germans (0.1%)  14,794 Others (0.6%)  In the 1979 Soviet census for the Moldavian SSR (including Transnistria, but without northern and southern Bessarabia, now both part of Ukraine): 63.9% identified themselves as Moldovans and 0.04% as Romanians. For the Soviet census of 1989 (conducted in the Moldavian SSR), 64.5% declared themselves as Moldovans and 0.06% Romanians. In the Moldovan census of 2014 (not including Transnistria), 75% declared themselves Moldovans and 7% Romanians.  Economy   1911: There were 165 loan societies, 117 savings banks, 43 professional savings and loan societies, and eight Zemstvo loan offices; all these had total assets of about 10,000,000 rubles. There were also 89 government savings banks, with deposits of about 9,000,000 rubles.  1918: There was only  of railway; the main lines converged on Russia and were broad gauge. Rolling stock and right of way were in bad shape. There were about 400 locomotives, with only about 100 fit for use. There were 290 passenger coaches and 33 more out for repair. Finally, out of 4530 freight cars and 187 tank cars, only 1389 and 103 were usable. The Romanians reduced the gauge to a standard , so that cars could be run to the rest of Europe. Also, there were only a few inefficient boat bridges. Romanian highway engineers decided to build ten bridges: Cuzl\u0103u, \u021au\u021bora, Lipcani, \u0218erpeni\u021ba, \u0218tef\u0103ne\u0219ti\u2013Br\u0103ni\u0219te, Cahul-Oancea, B\u0103d\u0103r\u0103i-Moara Domneasc\u0103, S\u0103rata, Bumbala-Leova, Badragi and F\u0103lciu (F\u0103lciu is a locality in Romania. Its correspondent in Bessarabia is Cantemir.) Of these, only four were ever finished: Cuzl\u0103u, F\u0103lciu, Lipcani, and S\u0103rata.  See also  References    Thilemann, Alfred.

It covers the territory between the Prut and the Dniester rivers, comprising the northern parts of the present-day Moldavian and Ukrainian states, and the eastern part of Romania. Bessarabia was historically part of the Principality of Moldavia. In the late 18th century, it was annexed by the Russian Empire, and in the 19th century, it became the object of diplomatic rivalries between Russia and the other Great Powers. The region was the site of an anti-Russian uprising in 1917, and after the Russian Revolution, it was integrated into Romania. In the aftermath of World War II, it was occupied by the Soviet Union and became part of the Moldavian ASSR and the Ukrainian SSR. The region was the site of an anti-Soviet uprising in the early 1990s. Today, the region consists of three separate political entities. Two-thirds of Bessarabia is within Moldova (the Republic of Moldova, also known as Moldavia), with a population of 3,620,000 in 2014. One-third is in Ukraine (oblasts of Chernivtsi, Odessa, and Mykolaiv), with a population of 1,600,000 in 2014. A small part is in Romania (the counties of Bac\u0103u, Vaslui, and Gala\u021bi), with a population of about 500,000 in 2014. The name Bessarabia is believed to be of Turkish origin, meaning \"the land of the Besso\". The term was first used by the Russian historian Nikolai Rumantsev in 1827 to describe the region between the Prut and the Dniester. The term Bessarabia was used by the Russian authorities to describe the region between the two rivers after they annexed it in the late 18th century. Bessarabia is located in Eastern Europe. It is bounded on the west by Romania, to the north by the Republic of Moldova, to the east by the Russian Federation and the Black Sea, and to the south by Ukraine. The territory of Bessarabia is very fertile and has a temperate continental climate with mild winters and warm summers. The region is rich in minerals, notably iron and coal. The largest river is the Dniester. The largest city is Chi\u0219in\u0103u, the capital of Moldova. Bessarabia is home to a number of universities, including the private West University in Chi\u0219in\u0103u, the state-owned University of Moldova in Chi\u0219in\u0103u, and the Technical University in Chi\u0219in\u0103u. In the Russian Empire, Bessarabia was part of the Bessarabian Governorate, which was divided into five Uyezds: * 1) B\u0103l\u021bi County * 2) Chi\u0219in\u0103u County * 3) Nisporeni County * 4) Ocni\u021ba County * 5) Orhei County After the Russian Revolution in 1917, Bessarabia was integrated into Romania. In the interwar period, the region was home to a significant German minority, which was almost entirely evacuated to Nazi Germany in the early 1940s. During World War II, Bessarabia was occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940 and became part of the Moldavian ASSR and the Ukrainian SSR. In the early 1990s, the region was the site of an anti-Soviet uprising, which was quickly suppressed by the Soviet authorities. Since the breakup of the Soviet Union, Bessarabia has been divided between Moldova and Ukraine. The Moldovan authorities have repeatedly stated their intention to seek the reunion of Bessarabia with Romania. The Ukrainian authorities have stated their opposition to such a move, and have instead proposed the creation of a separate Moldovan state on the eastern bank of the Dniester. In the Russian Empire, Bessarabia was part of the Bessarabian Governorate, which was divided into five Uyezds: * 1) B\u0103l\u021bi County * 2) Chi\u0219in\u0103u County * 3) Nisporeni County * 4) Ocni\u021ba County * 5) Orhei County After the Russian Revolution in 1917, Bessarabia was integrated into Romania.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Projective line\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "In mathematics, a projective line is, roughly speaking, the extension of a usual line by a point called a point at infinity. The statement and the proof of many theorems of geometry are simplified by the resultant elimination of special cases; for example, two distinct projective lines in a projective plane meet in exactly one point (there is no \"parallel\" case).  There are many equivalent ways to formally define a projective line; one of the most common is to define a projective line over a field K, commonly denoted P1(K), as the set of one-dimensional subspaces of a two-dimensional K-vector space. This definition is a special instance of the general definition of a projective space.  The projective line over the reals is a manifold; see real projective line for details.  Homogeneous coordinates An arbitrary point in the projective line P1(K) may be represented by an equivalence class of homogeneous coordinates, which take the form of a pair  of elements of K that are not both zero. Two such pairs are equivalent if they differ by an overall nonzero factor \u03bb:  Line extended by a point at infinity  The projective line may be identified with the line K extended by a point at infinity. More precisely, the line K may be identified with the subset of P1(K) given by  This subset covers all points in P1(K) except one, which is called the point at infinity:  This allows to extend the arithmetic on K to P1(K) by the formulas  Translating this arithmetic in terms of homogeneous coordinates gives, when  does not occur:  Examples  Real projective line  The projective line over the real numbers is called the real projective line.  It may also be thought of as the line K together with an idealised point at infinity \u221e ; the point connects to both ends of K creating a closed loop or topological circle.   An example is obtained by projecting points in R2 onto the unit circle and then identifying diametrically opposite points. In terms of group theory we can take the quotient by the subgroup   Compare the extended real number line, which distinguishes \u221e and \u2212\u221e.  Complex projective line: the Riemann sphere Adding a point at infinity to the complex plane results in a space that is topologically a sphere. Hence the complex projective line is also known as the Riemann sphere (or sometimes the Gauss sphere). It is in constant use in complex analysis, algebraic geometry and complex manifold theory, as the simplest example of a compact Riemann surface.  For a finite field  The projective line over a finite field Fq of q elements has  points. In all other respects it is no different from projective lines defined over other types of fields. In the terms of homogeneous coordinates , q of these points have the form:  for each  in ,  and the remaining point at infinity may be represented as [1 : 0].  Symmetry group Quite generally, the group of homographies with coefficients in K acts on the projective line P1(K). This group action is transitive, so that P1(K) is a homogeneous space for the group, often written PGL2(K) to emphasise the projective nature of these transformations. Transitivity says that there exists a homography that will transform any point Q to any other point R. The point at infinity on P1(K) is therefore an artifact of choice of coordinates: homogeneous coordinates  express a one-dimensional subspace by a single non-zero point  lying in it, but the symmetries of the projective line can move the point  to any other, and it is in no way distinguished.  Much more is true, in that some transformation can take any given distinct points Qi for  to any other 3-tuple Ri of distinct points (triple transitivity). This amount of specification 'uses up' the three dimensions of PGL2(K); in other words, the group action is sharply 3-transitive. The computational aspect of this is the cross-ratio. Indeed, a generalized converse is true: a sharply 3-transitive group action is always (isomorphic to) a generalized form of a PGL2(K) action on a projective line, replacing \"field\" by \"KT-field\" (generalizing the inverse to a weaker kind of involution), and \"PGL\" by a corresponding generalization of projective linear maps.  As algebraic curve The projective line is a fundamental example of an algebraic curve. From the point of view of algebraic geometry, P1(K) is a non-singular curve of genus 0. If K is algebraically closed, it is the unique such curve over K, up to rational equivalence. In general a (non-singular) curve of genus 0 is rationally equivalent over K to a conic C, which is itself birationally equivalent to projective line if and only if C has a point defined over K; geometrically such a point P can be used as origin to make explicit the birational equivalence..  The function field of the projective line is the field K(T) of rational functions over K, in a single indeterminate T. The field automorphisms of K(T) over K are precisely  the group PGL2(K) discussed above.   Any function field K(V) of an algebraic variety V over K, other than a single point, has a subfield isomorphic with K(T). From the point of view of birational geometry, this means that there will be a rational map from V to P1(K), that is not constant. The image will omit only finitely many points of P1(K), and the inverse image of a typical point P will be of dimension . This is the beginning of methods in algebraic geometry that are inductive on dimension. The rational maps play a role analogous to the meromorphic functions of complex analysis, and indeed in the case of compact Riemann surfaces the two concepts coincide.  If V is now taken to be of dimension 1, we get a picture of a typical algebraic curve C presented 'over' P1(K). Assuming C is non-singular (which is no loss of generality starting with K(C)), it can be shown that such a rational map from C to P1(K) will in fact be everywhere defined. (That is not the case if there are singularities, since for example a double point where a curve crosses itself may give an indeterminate result after a rational map.) This gives a picture in which the main geometric feature is ramification.   Many curves, for example hyperelliptic curves, may be presented abstractly, as ramified covers of the projective line. According to the Riemann\u2013Hurwitz formula, the genus then depends only on the type of ramification.  A rational curve is a curve that is birationally equivalent to a projective line (see rational variety); its genus is 0. A rational normal curve in projective space Pn is a rational curve that lies in no proper linear subspace; it is known that there is only one example (up to projective equivalence), given parametrically in homogeneous coordinates as  [1 : t : t2 : ... : tn].

The projective line may be described as the set of all points which have the same configuration with respect to the planes defined by three given non-collinear points. More formally, the projective line may be defined as the set of points whose projective coordinates, when expressed in the basis of three given points, are all equal to one another. The projective line has a natural structure of a projective curve, but becomes an affine curve if we choose a basis in which three points are collinear. A projective line can be regarded as a projective generalization of a line in affine space. In the special case of a projective line in the real projective plane, we can choose a basis such that the real projective line is the set of all points whose first two coordinates are equal to each other and whose third coordinate is equal to zero. This special projective line is called the absolute projective line. A projective line is not in general the same as the set of all points on a line in affine space, because the projective line contains \"extra\" points which are not on any line in affine space. For example, the set of all points with two equal coordinates and one equal to zero contains, in addition to the points on any line in affine space, the \"extra\" point at infinity in the direction of the line. Projective lines can be used to defineprojective planes, projective spaces, and other geometric structures. In the theory of algebraic curves, the special case of a projective line is called a conic section. In the theory of complex projective spaces, the projective line is called a complex projective curve.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 398578}

It is their best-known work and was originally released on Effective Records. The 12-inch single contained the original, instrumental version (The Naked Mix) along with Darren Emerson's remix on the B-side. This was Emerson's first remix, and also Darren's 1st record label. The 1992 release was an immediate success in underground dance clubs, and eventually became a hit on the UK Singles Chart, peaking at number 29.  Critical reception Alan Jones from Music Week described it as \"an uplifting house tune\" in his review of the 1992 version.  Impact and legacy \"Passion\" is one of the first songs to be referred to as \"progressive house\". Nick Warren has described the single as one of the first to create a distinctive British house sound. The distinctive \"piano-house\" progression in its second half was played by Simon Slater who said, \"The piano break was played by me and the break is actually 1 semitone up from the bass line which is unusual but it worked and was kept like it is in the track as you know it. Then I delayed the track and added delays to create the piano rhythm.\" In 1996, Mixmag magazine ranked the 1992 single number 33 on their list of the \"50 Most Influential Records of All Time\".  In addition, Mixmag (and their readers) ranked \"Passion\" number 22 on Mixmag's list of \"100 Best Dance Singles of All Time\".  British DJ, Tony De Vit picked the song as one of his favourites in 1996, saying, \"I don't like piano tunes but the production here is 101% and I like everything about it. I wish I'd made that record. It's relentless, dancey, soulful and so well put together. It is the perfect song \u2014 and I hate piano tunes, that's how good it is. If I made this record I could stop tomorrow.\"  Since its original release, \"Passion\" has been officially and unofficially re-issued several times. Remixed by East London DJ Mervyn Victor after playing it live in the mix for several years he finally put out a few DJ only copies in 1994 on vinyl calling it \"Degrees of Passion\". This was a version of the 1992 seven-minute instrumental with a mixed in vocal from \"Do You Want It Right Now?\" by Degrees of Motion featuring Biti. The vocal used from Degrees of Motion was sung by Biti Strauchn At the time nearly every major DJ in the UK jumped on it making it a cult hit.  In 1996 a four-minute version subtitled the \"Do You Want It Right Now Mix\", featured a new version of the \"Do You Want It Right Now\" vocal recorded by Beverley Skeete peaked at number six in the UK.  As of 2008, countless bootlegs have been released, consisting of remixes and other mash-ups.  The track has appeared on an abundance of compilation albums and DJ-mix sets (both official and unofficial).  Other producers who have mixed the song throughout the years include Junior Vasquez and DJ Chus. The track, in both its original and various bootleg forms, is still widely played in nightclubs to this day.

It was established in 1935 and occupies most of 9 Fitzmaurice Place, a street connecting Berkeley Square to Curzon Street in Mayfair.  History  The club formed later than many London clubs, and it permitted women from its inception. It has always had a relatively young membership, with an active social scene. The building's main Adam and otherwise 1930s Art Deco interiors, with some authentic frontages, mean it has been Grade II* listed since its first assessment in 1970. This is the mid-category of listed building, a statutory scheme of protection which has a pyramidal hierarchy.  In 1930, Westminster City Council decided to improve access to Berkeley Square by creating an extra road into the square. This was accomplished by demolishing half of the main range of Lansdowne House, which stood since the 1760s. What remained was given a new frontage and a newly renovated interior, and became the Lansdowne Club. The 'First Drawing Room' was thus taken to the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and the 'Dining Room' exists in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.  The venue was founded as a 'social, residential and athletic Club for members of social standing' and their families, and unlike many rivals, it had no vocational, artistic, or political 'theme'. Its facilities include a ballroom, a terrace, a fencing Salle and a basement gym with Art Deco swimming pool. Internally architecture is extremely unusual; some is modern for its type, being significantly Art Deco, as opposed to Georgian/Victorian/Edwardian styles. The Adam Room and other parts of the club on the ground floor are Georgian though.  The building underwent extensive renovation and further modernisation in 2000.

The phrase \"patently offensive\" first appeared in Roth v. United States, referring to any obscene acts or materials that are considered to be openly, plainly, or clearly visible as offensive to the viewing public. The Roth standard outlined what is to be considered obscene and thus not under First Amendment protection. The Roth standard was largely replaced by the Miller test established by Miller v. California (1973).  Roth standard  According to the \"Roth Standard\" a work is obscene if: The dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to a prurient interest in sex, The material is patently offensive because it affronts contemporary community standards relating to the description or representation of sexual matters, The material is utterly without redeeming social value  Miller test  The Miller test was developed in the 1973 case Miller v. California. It has three parts:  Whether the average person, applying contemporary community standards, would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest, Whether the work depicts/describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct or excretory functions specifically defined by applicable state law, Whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.  Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, writing for the majority, included the following definitions of what may be \"patently offensive\":  \"Representations or descriptions of ultimate sex acts normal or perverted, actual or simulated.\"    \"Representations or descriptions of masturbation, excretory functions, and lewd exhibitions of the genitals.\"  References  Supreme Court of the United States Obscenity law", "machine_text": " Patently offensive The term \"patently offensive\" was coined by United States Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart in his concurring opinion in the 1967 case of Jacobellis v. Ohio, 378 U.S. 79. The case involved a challenge to the obscenity provisions of a statute criminalizing the sale of \"pornographic materials\" to minors. At issue was a copy of the French film Les Amants de la Bastille, which had been imported into the United States and was in the possession of an adult but was shown to minors. The Supreme Court had previously upheld the obscenity provisions of the law in a 1959 case, Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476. In Jacobellis, however, four Justices\u2014Stewart, Hugo Black, William O. Douglas, and Abe Fortas\u2014sided with the lower court's ruling that the film was not obscene and should not have been banned. In his concurring opinion, Stewart wrote: I shall not today attempt to define the kinds of material I understand to be embraced within that shorthand description; and perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly doing so. But I know it when I see it, and the motion picture involved in this case is not that. In a broader sense, the film is patently offensive to me, as it is to most people, not because of the questionable moral values it expresses (for I do not pretend to have settled opinions on such matters) but because of the humiliation and disgrace it imposes upon what we have been taught to regard as the \"first principles\" of Americanism\u2014freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of religion. The term has since been used to indicate speech or expression that is shocking, disgusting, or offensive to the majority of people.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 17496561}

The competition was expanded to 16 teams (from 12 teams in the previous edition).  The Netherlands were declared as hosts by the UEFA Executive Committee on 4 December 2014.  Germany's 22-year reign as champions of Europe was ended after losing 1\u20132 to Denmark in the quarter-finals. In addition it was only Germany's second loss in the finals since 1993. Another former winner, Norway, lost to both finalists, the Netherlands and Denmark, and ended without goals or points.  The Netherlands won their first ever title by beating fellow first time finalists, Denmark, 4\u20132 in the final.  Host selection Expressions of interest in hosting the tournament were received from seven associations.                 On 4 December 2014 The Netherlands were chosen as hosts for the first time having never previously staged the tournament.  Qualification  A total of 47 UEFA nations entered the competition (including Andorra which entered for the first time at senior women's level), and with the hosts Netherlands qualifying automatically, the other 46 teams competed in the qualifying competition to determine the remaining 15 spots in the final tournament. The qualifying competition, which took place from April 2015 to October 2016, consisted of three rounds:  Preliminary round: The eight lowest-ranked teams were drawn into two groups of four teams. Each group was played in single round-robin format at one of the pre-selected hosts. The two group winners advanced to the qualifying group stage.  Qualifying group stage: The 40 teams (38 highest-ranked teams and two preliminary round qualifiers) were drawn into eight groups of five teams. Each group was played in home-and-away round-robin format. The eight group winners and the six best runners-up (not counting results against the fifth-placed team) qualified directly for the final tournament, while the two remaining runners-up advanced to the play-offs.  Play-offs: The two teams played home-and-away two-legged matches to determine the last qualified team.  Qualified teams The following 16 teams qualified for the final tournament. Five teams made their Women's Euro debuts. The only team that qualified in 2013 but did not qualify in 2017 was Finland.  Notes  Final draw The final draw was held on 8 November 2016, 17:30 CET (UTC+1), at the Luxor Theatre in Rotterdam. The 16 teams were drawn into four groups of four teams. The teams were seeded according to their coefficient ranking following the end of the qualifying group stage (excluding the play-offs), with the hosts Netherlands assigned to position A1 in the draw. Each group contained one team from each of the four seeding pots.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Mercedes-Benz W142\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Mercedes-Benz W 142 (Mercedes-Benz Typ 320) was a six-cylinder passenger car launched in February 1937, as a successor to the Mercedes-Benz Typ 290 (Mercedes-Benz W 18). The car was known by its name Typ 320 at the time of its production and service, but is in retrospect commonly referred to using its Mercedes-Benz works number, \"W142\", which gives a more unambiguously unique nomenclature.  Mercedes-Benz Typ 320 n (Works number W142/I)  1937\u20131938  The standard-wheelbase version of the W142 shared its  wheelbase with the standard lengthened versions of its predecessor, but a more streamlined form with longer overhangs meant that even in this form the W142 was substantially longer and indeed wider than the earlier car. The front grill was gently raked backwards, and there was no longer a bar in front of it to carry lights, all of which gave the car a more sporting look than the model it replaced.  Power came from a newly enlarged straight six 3,208 cc side-valve engine with a listed maximum output of  at 4,000 rpm, supporting a claimed top speed of 130\u00a0km/h (81\u00a0mph). This was delivered to the rear wheels via a four-speed manual transmission which, unusually in the 1930s, incorporated synchromesh on all four ratios. The footbrake used a hydraulic control mechanism and operated on all four wheels. The suspension set-up was carried over from the W18 with a swing axle at the rear and the front axle suspended with a central transverse leaf spring and coil springs beside the wheels.  Customers wishing to make their own arrangements in respect of bodywork could buy a standard-wheelbase W142 in base chassis form at the manufacturer's listed price of 6,500 Marks. Otherwise the choice of standard bodies was restricted to a three-seat cabriolet (known as the \"Cabriolet A\") or a coup\u00e9-bodied equivalent with a removable roof, priced respectively at 11,800 Marks or 12,300 Marks.  Mercedes-Benz Typ 320 (Works number W142/II)  1937\u20131938  Longer-bodied cars came with an extra  of wheelbase, and Mercedes-Benz offered a choice from a wide range of standard body options for the longer cars.  Customers happy to make their own arrangements in respect of bodywork could buy a longer-wheelbase W142 in base chassis form at the manufacturer's listed price of 6,800 Marks, or 300 Marks more than the price of the shorter chassis. The entry level model with a Mercedes-Benz body included in the price was the four-door \u201dLimousine\u201d (sedan/saloon) at 8,950 Marks. There were no fewer than four cabriolet-bodied versions of the longer-wheelbase car offered, being a two-door 2/3-seater (\"Cabriolet A\"), a two-door 4-seater with four side-windows (\"Cabriolet B\"), a four-door 4-seater (\"Cabriolet D\") and a very substantial-looking four-door 6-seater with three rows of seats (\"Pullman-Cabriolet F\"). Other soft-topped standard-bodied versions were a Torpedo-bodied 6-seater \"Tourenwagen\" and a sporty 2-seater Roadster. There was also a six-seater \u201cPullman-Limousine\u201d with three rows of seats and six side windows under a conventional steel roof. The rear seat of the Pullman-bodied cars was above the back axle, and an extra luggage locker at the back left the overall length of the Pullman-Limousine at , still using the  wheelbase. The highest listed price for a Mercedes-Benz-bodied W142 was 14,500 Marks for a \"Stromlinien-Limousine\" featuring a strikingly modern exceptionally streamlined steel body.  Mercedes-Benz Typ 320 (Works number W142/III)  1937\u20131939  The short-wheelbase version of the car was also the basis for a \"Wehrmachtsk\u00fcbelwagen\" (military vehicle), one of several such vehicles which may have provided inspiration for the subsequent (1941) Jeep. The W142 \u201cK\u00fcbelwagen\u201d retained the frontal style of the car on which it was based, but with a horizontal bar ahead of the front grill on which to mount lights. It had four front-hinged doors, a canvas top and wide-tread tyres for rough terrain. In this form the vehicle came with a listed top speed of 118\u00a0km/h (73\u00a0mph).  Mercedes-Benz Typ 320 (Works number W142/IV)  1938\u20131942  In 1938 the manufacturer increased the cylinder bore to , thereby increasing the engine capacity to 3,405 cc. Nevertheless, the cars retained the \"Typ 320\" designation. There was also no change in the power output, still listed at  at 4,000 rpm, and there were no claims of improved performance. Instead the compression ratio was lowered in anticipation of future shortages enforcing the use of fuel synthesized from coal which was expected to have a lower octane rating than the \u201cnormal\u201d fuel used at the time. The larger-engined car also came with an overdrive ratio (1 : 0.73) added to the hitherto four-speed gear box which the car had featured since launch.  In 1939 the larger engine was also used in the W142/III K\u00fcbelwagen, this time accompanied by a small increase in maximum output to  and an accompanying reassurance that the top speed was undiminished.  Commercial Between 1937 and 1942 Mercedes-Benz produced 4,326 of the 3,208\u00a0cc cars and 885 of the 3,405\u00a0cc cars.  Production of a further 1,806 W142 based military K\u00fcbelwagen between 1938 and 1940 is also recorded.

Storylines The event featured seven professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed either a villainous or fan favorite gimmick as they followed a series of events which generally built tension, leading to a wrestling match. The name of a wrestler's character was not always the person's birth name, as wrestlers often use a stage name to portray their character. All wrestlers were from the SmackDown! brand\u00a0\u2013 a storyline division in which WWE assigned its employees to a different program, the other being Raw.  The main event at Judgment Day was between John Cena and John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL) over the WWE Championship in an \"I Quit\" match. The previous month at WrestleMania 21, Cena defeated JBL to win the WWE Championship. On the April 7 episode of SmackDown!, SmackDown! General Manager Theodore Long scheduled a series of number one contenders matches, after JBL, Eddie Guerrero, Rey Mysterio, The Big Show, Booker T, and Kurt Angle all demanded a WWE Championship match. The first match that Long announced was between JBL and Rey Mysterio. Mysterio was disqualified, after Eddie Guerrero interfered and attacked JBL, resulting in JBL winning the match. The following week on SmackDown!, Guerrero and Kurt Angle were scheduled for the second contender's match. Angle advanced to the finals, as he went on to defeat Guerrero. Later during the program, Cena unveiled a spinner version of the WWE championship. Before the unveiling, however, JBL came out wearing the original WWE championship. On the April 21 episode of SmackDown!, Booker T and Big Show were booked in another contenders match. After the match ended in a double disqualification, Long booked JBL, Angle, Booker T, and Big Show in a Fatal Four-Way match for the following week. JBL won the match, after he pinned Angle and having the right to face Cena at Judgment Day for the WWE Championship. On the May 5 episode of SmackDown!, Cena proposed that he would defend the championship against JBL in an \"I Quit\" match. Two weeks later, on the May 19 episode of SmackDown!, JBL faced Scotty 2 Hotty, which Scotty won after JBL was disqualified. After the match, however, JBL attacked Scotty and demanded that he say \"I quit.\" JBL further the assault, choking him with a leather belt, Scotty said \"I quit.\" That same night, Cena defeated The Basham Brothers (Doug Basham and Danny Basham) in a handicap match. During the duration of the match, JBL, who was at ringside, yelled at Cena, telling him to say \"I quit.\"  One of the featured preliminary matches was Rey Mysterio versus Eddie Guerrero in a singles match. One month prior to Judgment Day, at WrestleMania 21, Mysterio defeated Guerrero. In the weeks that followed, Guerrero and Mysterio were challenged by MNM (Joey Mercury, Johnny Nitro, and Melina) to defend the WWE Tag Team Championship, which Guerrero and Mysterio accepted. MNM defeated Guerrero and Mysterio to win the WWE Tag Team Championship. On the April 28 episode of SmackDown!, Guerrero and Mysterio were given a rematch for the WWE Tag Team Championship. During the match, however, Mysterio accidentally performed a flying body press on Guerrero which led to Guerrero abandoning Mysterio, but returned as the fans urged Guerrero to come back. MNM retained the belt after pinning Mysterio for the win. The following week, Theodore Long booked a Street Fight between Mysterio and Guerrero's nephew, Chavo Guerrero. Mysterio came out as the winner of the match. After the match (which Mysterio won), Chavo, Mercury, and Nitro attacked Mysterio, which prompted Guerrero to come out and clear the ring. Guerrero, however, attacked Mysterio. The assault led to Guerrero lifting Mysterio off the ground and driving Mysterio's back on the ring steps. This angle saw Guerrero turn into a villain. As a result, the following week, Long promoted a match between Guerrero and Mysterio at Judgment Day.  The other featured preliminary match was Kurt Angle versus Booker T in a singles match. On the April 28 episode of SmackDown!, Angle, Booker T, Big Show and JBL took part in a Fatal four-way match to determine the number one contender for the WWE Championship, which JBL won. During the match, Angle hit Booker T with a steel chair to eliminate him. Booker came back and hit Angle with a chair to cause him to be eliminated. The following week, Angle challenged Booker T to a match at Judgment Day, which Booker accepted. Prior to that, Angle had insulted Booker T's wife, Sharmell, which led to Booker T attacking and accepting Angle's challenge. On the May 12 episode of SmackDown!, Angle admitted he would like to have \"perverted sex\" with Sharmell. That same night, Angle and Booker T were scheduled in a match, which led to Angle leaving the ring and going backstage to Sharmell. Booker T went backstage and found Sharmell on the floor crying. This led to Angle attacking Booker T from behind and pushing him towards a pair of steel lockers. The following week, Long suspended Angle and demanded that Angle apologize for his actions. Angle apologized, but admitted that he actually kissed Sharmell and let her fondle his \"private parts\" before Booker T made his way to the locker room. Booker T, while watching the interview kicked a television monitor down and broke it.  #1 contender tournament bracket  Event  Before the Judgment Day event aired live on pay-per-view, Nunzio defeated Akio in a match that aired on Sunday Night Heat.  Preliminary matches  After Sunday Night Heat, the pay-per-view began with a tag team match where MNM (Joey Mercury and Johnny Nitro) (with Melina) defended the WWE Tag Team Championship against the team of Hardcore Holly and Charlie Haas. The match started off with Nitro and Haas in the ring. Haas took the advantage in the match and was able to tag in Holly. There was back and forth action between the two teams, as all of the superstars were able to participate in the match. After a Snapshot to Haas, Mercury pinned Haas, which resulted in MNM retaining the tag team titles.  The second wrestling match on the pay-per-view was The Big Show versus Carlito, who was accompanied by Matt Morgan. For the duration of the match, Big Show used his body size to his advantage as he squashed, or easily and quickly performed moves on Carlito. The momentum changed, when Carlito gained control part way through the match. In the end, Big Show accidentally whipped Carlito into the referee. This saw Carlito hit a low blow on Big Show. Carlito won the match and gained the successful pinfall after Morgan delivered an F-5 to Big Show.  The next match was a standard match for the WWE Cruiserweight Championship, in which Paul London defended the title against Chavo Guerrero. After back and forth action between the two, London was able to perform a 450\u00b0 splash. London then pinned Guerrero to retain the WWE Cruiserweight title.  The final preliminary match was Kurt Angle versus Booker T. After Booker T backed Angle into the ring ropes and executed a shoulder charge, Angle began to bleed from the mouth. The match saw exchange offense from both Angle and Booker T. The match came to an end when Angle attempted an Angle Slam, but Booker T grabbed Angle's leg and rolled him into a pinfall victory.  Main event matches  The first featured match was for the WWE United States Championship, where Orlando Jordan defended the title against Heidenreich. As the match began, Jordan was able to perform a dropkick, sending Heidenreich through the ropes to the outside. Heidenreich, however, would gain the advantage after countering Jordan's attack from the top rope into a suplex. Afterwards, Jordan delivered a DDT and pinned Heidenreich to retain the United States title.  The next match was Eddie Guerrero versus Rey Mysterio in a standard match. In the match, Mysterio tried to counter Guerrero's offense, but Guerrero blocked all of Mysterio's attempts. Mysterio gained the advantage when he was able to execute a flying headbutt to Guerrero. Chavo ran down to the ring to distract the referee, as Eddie grabbed a chair. Guerrero then attempted to hit Mysterio with the chair, but Mysterio dodged it with a low dropkick and performed another low dropkick, setting up Guerrero on the ropes for a 619. Mysterio won after Guerrero was disqualified for attacking him with a steel chair.  The main event was the \"I Quit\" match for the WWE Championship, in which John Cena defended his title against JBL. Cena came out on the flatbed of a semi truck with a DJ on a turntable mixing his theme song. During the match, both Cena and JBL were able to get in offense. Cena performed a Back Body Drop through an announce table on JBL. Shortly after, JBL struck Cena with a steel chair which caused Cena to bleed from his forehead. JBL performed a Clothesline from Hell on Cena, who later performed an FU on JBL. Later in the match, in the ramp area, Cena threw JBL through a television monitor, causing JBL to bleed. JBL quit as Cena prepared to attacked him with an exhaust pipe, which was from the semi truck, meaning Cena retained the WWE Championship. After the match, Cena struck JBL with the exhaust pipe, causing him to fall through a glass panel that was part of the entrance stage.  Reception The Target Center had a maximum capacity of 20,000, which was reduced for the event. This event grossed over $500,000 from an approximate attendance of 9,500, the maximum allowed. It also received 220,000 pay-per-view buys. Judgment Day helped WWE earn $21.6\u00a0million in revenue from pay-per-view events versus $16.9\u00a0million the previous year, which was later confirmed by Linda McMahon on September 7, 2005 in a quarterly result. Canadian Online Explorer's professional wrestling section rated the event a 5 out of 10 stars. The rating was lower than the Judgment Day event in 2006, which was said to be an entertaining pay-per-view to watch. The \"I Quit\" match between John Cena and JBL was rated an eight out of 10 stars. Additionally, the match between Orlando Jordan and Heidenreich was rated a 4 out of 10 stars.  The event was released on DVD on June 21, 2005 by Sony Music Entertainment.  Aftermath On the June 6 episode of Raw, one of WWE's primary television programs, John Cena's SmackDown! tenure came to an end when he became the first wrestler selected by Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff in the draft lottery, a mock sports draft lottery in which wrestlers switched programs. Cena immediately entered a staged rivalry with Eric Bischoff after when he refused to participate in Bischoff's \"war\" against the upcoming Extreme Championship Wrestling reunion show. Cena went on to resume his feud with Christian, as they had an encounter at the Royal Rumble in January. During the feud, Chris Jericho was involved as well, as he protested Bischoff's actions of scheduling a WWE championship match between Cena and Christian at Vengeance. After defeating Christian and Tyson Tomko in a tag team match, Jericho betrayed Cena. Convinced with the outcome of the events, Bischoff changed the original match between Christian and Cena to a Triple Threat Match, involving Jericho for the WWE Championship at Vengeance. At the event, Cena retained the WWE Championship.  On the June 30 episode of SmackDown!, a match between six wrestlers for a new top-tier SmackDown! championship was held. JBL, one of the participants, was victorious in the match, but Theodore Long announced that he was still not the champion. Instead he had won the right to a match against the World Heavyweight champion, Batista, who was SmackDown!'s final 2005 draft pick, making the World Heavyweight Championship exclusive to SmackDown!. The following week, it was announced Batista would meet JBL at The Great American Bash with the World Heavyweight championship on the line. At the Great American Bash, Batista was disqualified for attacking JBL with a chair and JBL was declared the winner. In WWE, a title cannot be won by disqualification, but only by pinfall or submission (the normal scoring conditions in professional wrestling matches). As a result, Batista retained the title.  On the June 13 episode of Raw, Kurt Angle's tenure with SmackDown! came to an end, as he was also drafted to the Raw brand. There, he immediately continued his feud with Shawn Michaels. At the start of the year, Angle and Michaels both participated in the Royal Rumble match at the January pay-per-view event. During the match, Michaels eliminated Angle. In retaliation, Angle returned to the match and eliminated Michaels and then attacked him outside the ring. The two engaged in a feud, which led to an Interpromotional match at WrestleMania 21, as Angle was part of the SmackDown! roster and Michaels belonged to the Raw roster. At WrestleMania 21, Angle got the win over Michaels by forcing him to submit to an ankle lock submission hold. The same evening Angle was drafted, Michaels challenged Angle to a WrestleMania 21 rematch at Vengeance, in which Angle accepted. At Vengeance, the rematch saw Michaels defeat Angle.  The angle between Eddie Guerrero and Rey Mysterio continued. On an episode of SmackDown!, Guerrero threatened to reveal a secret concerning Mysterio's son Dominik. This led the families of both Guerrero and Mysterio pleading with Guerrero not to reveal the secret. At the Great American Bash, Mysterio defeated Guerrero in a match where if Guerrero lost, he could not reveal the secret. On the July 28 episode of SmackDown!, Guerrero, however, revealed the secret, claiming he was Dominick's scripted biological father. The storyline also went on that Guerrero knew Mysterio was having trouble starting his own family, so Guerrero left Dominick to be raised by Mysterio's family. In subsequent weeks, Guerrero threatened to take custody of Dominick, drawing up custody papers and having his lawyer present them to Mysterio. This led to a Ladder match, a match where the objective was to climb a ladder and reach an object hanging above the ring, between the two for the custody of Dominick at SummerSlam, which Mysterio won.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Val (sculptor)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Val\u00e9rie Goutard, (20 May 1967 \u2013 27 October 2016) was a French sculptor who used VAL as her artist's name.  Biography  Val, was born in Boulogne-Billancourt, Hauts-de-Seine. Her parents were Nathalie Goutard and Jean-Claude Goutard, an engineer working for a large oil company. Because of her father's position, she shared her childhood between Europe, Africa and South America. After studying literature and advertising, she worked in marketing until 2001. In 2002 a friend, Florence Jouglard, an auctioneer by training and also an artist, enticed her to try to sculpt from clay.  Working on clay with her own hands, Val felt a revelation, a kind of \"love at first sight\" for this activity which she perceived as an extension of her inner world. \"It was like a revelation, a sort of resurgence of a long-buried memory. My love for sculpture, the material and the volume was born in a completely immediate fashion\", she said during an interview in 2014. During two years, Val took art lessons in Paris and then, in August 2004, went to settle in Thailand, where she gave up clay for working with bronze.  Working with this material, Goutard, who took the artist's name of VAL, and emphasized her self-learning. Her relative lack of culture in visual arts brought her, she said, \"a freedom vis-\u00e0-vis the masters\", a larger freedom of creation.  In 2007, she met in Bangkok Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Morel, who she in married in 2009. He gave up his work in business to promote VAL's work on the art market and establish her reputation at an international level.  Through multiple international solo-exhibitions and public installations, VAL became an artist recognized in Asia and Europe.  At the end of 2015, she received the Troph\u00e9e des Fran\u00e7ais de l\u2019\u00e9tranger from the French foreign minister Laurent Fabius.  Shortly before the opening of an exhibition of a new series of art works at the RedSea Gallery in Singapore, VAL died in a motorbike accident in October 2016 in the Thai province of Chonburi. After her funeral in a Buddhist temple in Bangkok and at the Catholic church of Missions Etrang\u00e8res de Paris, also in Bangkok, her ashes were spread on the site of Ocean Utopia, one of her major art works, near Ko Tao.  Artistic career  One of her early works, Miss Trendy, produced in 2004, is a simple 40 centimeters high feminine character, with striking posture, gracefulness and proportions. VAL's works quickly became more elaborate. A first theme appeared: the relationships between human being and the space around him, between man, men, and their environment. Many of her early works represent one or several people who are interacting with a given space, which is soberly represented by a few elements: a bench, a vertical structure, a staircase... This theme of the harmony, of the \"balance in the imbalance\" was one of the important axis of the artist's oeuvre. \"Finding a kind of balance which emerges with a notion of hope, a fragile balance which also expresses hope\", she said.  Man knows his fragility in face of the world, but it is his ability to react and to hope, his attitude in this confrontation which fascinated VAL. Linked to this theme, also emerged the idea of a journey, of a path on which man progresses, sometimes alone, sometimes along with companions. The idea of a \u00ab chain \u00bb appeared, which will be a recurring theme during VAL's career and will be masterly reaffirmed in her very last artwork, Du chaos \u00e0 la sagesse (From Chaos to Wisdom). \"We are alone with our own imaginary world and, at the same time, I find in a very curious way that, when we open and look outside, we see that many people, in an isolated way, are going in the same direction. And for me, I have the impression to participate to a chain which completely overtakes us\", she explained.  In 2008, the Wellington Gallery in Hong Kong displayed some of her works: it was the first international gallery which got interested by VAL's art pieces. After this, the same gallery organizes several solo exhibitions in 2009 and 2010, which strengthened VAL's reputation in the artistic world in Asia.  After her wedding with Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Morel in 2009, VAL set up a work team, composed of Thai artisans, to help her in the production of her artworks. Her spacious workshop is located in an area in northeastern Bangkok. Once the molds of her sculptures were done, VAL and her team had the bronze pieces cast in these molds at the Fine Arts Foundry of Ayuthaya, located near the ancient royal capital of Siam. Through the years, she acquired a vast experience while working with the 160 artisans of this foundry, who are working for many artists based in the country. The welding of the bronze pieces was done at the Bangkok workshop \u2013 a crucial stage where the orientation of a character, the positioning of hands or the degree of inclination of a head would give to the work its final expression. Several galleries were actively supporting and promoting VAL's works, most prominently the Philippe Staib Gallery in Shanghai and Taipei and the RedSea Gallery in Singapore. The founders of these two galleries, Philippe Staib and Christopher Churcher, who progressively became close friends with VAL and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric, played a crucial role in VAL's career and organized numerous exhibitions of the artist's works, in Taiwan, Beijing, Shanghai, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and New Delhi.  VAL's international reputation grew and she created in 2010 an artwork named Urban Life for the Jing\u2019An International Sculpture Project in Shanghai. With a height of five meters, it was VAL's first monumental art piece; a new challenge for the artist who, up to then, had worked on pieces not higher than one meter. Urban Life is a series of twisted frames, on which are perched characters with long and thin arms and legs in various attitudes, seating as if plunged into deep thought, walking precariously, running or meeting each other. \"I had to enlarge by six times the original sculpture I did. It is a very important step for a sculptor to have the opportunity to do such a big piece\", she said in an interview at the fair.  The change of scale required to rethink the artwork in order to find a new balance between the characters and the architecture.  In the same year, VAL was invited to participate to the Shanghai Art Fair, one of the most important international Art Fair in Asia. Besides a solo exhibition of her works, Urban Life was displayed in front of the building where the Art Fair was taking place : it was VAL's first public installation.  This art piece was an important new step for VAL at several levels. First at a technical level: her sculptures became monumental, which forced her and her team to answer a new series of challenges in terms of conception, moulding and assemblage. \"To keep the rightness of the feature during the transformation, to preserve the fragility of human destiny on sculptures weighing several hundreds of kilos are bets, which are both intellectual and technical\", she wrote in a note in March 2013. In parallel, VAL confronted new challenges, as with her 2 meters 25 centimeters-high sculpture Inle Balance III produced in 2012, which represents a character perched on an imaginary embarkation and directly inspired by the fishermen of the Inle lake in Burma \u2013 a perfectly balanced artwork with which the artist considered that she had \"overtaken the law of Newton\".  Then, and it is probably the most important, a new theme emerged in the artist's work, the theme of \"monumental fragility\" - an expression that she would employ often in her public presentations. The characters are not anymore only these figures that we can lay down on a table, but large, lanky and faceless characters, sometimes perched on top of stairs, sometimes strolling across frames made of solids and voids or hanging as if suspended in mid-air. \"How to preserve the lightness and the poetry in a sculpture several meters high?\", she wondered during a public presentation in November 2015. For the artist, the answer laid in the \"understanding of what constitutes the strength and the specificity of the artwork, in order to stress the strong points. This requests extreme rigor, an answer to new requirements\".  VAL described this period as a \"formidable time of maturation\".  From 2011 on, the artist's reputation spread internationally. Hundreds of collectors became interested by her artworks. After the first temporary public installation in Shanghai in 2010, VAL had multiple permanent installations of her works in Bangkok, in Taiwan (Taipei and Taichung) and in Singapore. She exhibited her artworks in China, Taiwan, Malaysia and in Singapore, but also in France, Holland, Belgium and England.  In March 2016, the Art Museum of the Central Academy of Fine Arts of Beijing (CAFA) organized a large exhibition of the artist's artworks under the name \"Anatomy of a creative path\", with the support of the Philippe Staib Gallery. This same exhibition had been displayed in November 2015 at the foundation Yishu8, in the buildings of the former Chinese-French university in Beijing. In her opening speech for the exhibition, VAL explained her vision. \"My work is like a dive, a listening to vibrations, to my inner palpitations, to a rhythm which seems to get tuned in with nature, to an echo\", she said.  She underlined also that her sculptures are \"a proposal\" and that she offers neither answers, nor certainties. \"I look for the momentum which will be crystallized at a certain time by a feeling of balance, of rightness, of harmony as we can feel sometimes that some moments are good\", she added. CAFA acquired two of VAL's art works, Eternal Pillars and Autoportrait, for the permanent collection of its museum.  The artist maintained an humble attitude vis-\u00e0-vis her artworks and her public. She considered that the most important when one sees a sculpture is that \"there is an emotion which surges from it\" and that \"a dialogue\" is established between the person who watches and the object being watched.  \"Passersby at exhibitions and art fairs often approached VAL who, while answering their questions, was listening to their comments with the humility of a great artist hiding humbly behind her creations. She was listening and learning from all\", wrote Philippe Staib, founder of the Philippe Staib Gallery.  An avid reader fascinated by literature \u2013 she particularly liked the writings of Fran\u00e7ois Cheng -, VAL had the rare ability to perfectly express herself through the words in her writings and through the forms in her art works. One was especially struck by her sincerity, her goodness and her deep humanity: attentive to everyone, very affective, she always tried to establish a dialogue, to create a meaningful exchange with her interlocutors.  After almost ten years of success and an enormous artistic production, VAL felt the need to renew her inspiration. She would first venture into a new path by launching a project which was both original and eco-friendly: installing bronze sculptures on the sea bed near the island of Ko Tao in southern Thailand. The idea came from a desire of a new artistic experience as well as from a motivation to contribute to protecting the environment. Installing three large bronze characters leaning on concrete walls would allow bits of broken corals, ripped away accidentally by divers or by natural incidents, to grow again, as they need to be fixed on some spot off the ground to be able to develop. The NGO New Heaven Conservation Program, specialized in the protection of the sea bed, took care of the ecological side of the project.  In parallel, VAL wished to explore a new dimension of the interaction between her creations and nature with this outstanding public installation. \"I love the interaction of nature with sculpture. With this project, nature and sculpture will be even more intermingled, because the corals will themselves become the sculpture\", said VAL in an interview.  The project was a logistical challenge: the sculpture and their concrete base were weighing each over two tons. Moreover, the undersea currents forced the team to use a system of rails to stabilize the bronze characters once they were installed with the help of a crane on the sea bed at a depth of 12 meters. But the project finished in March 2016 was a success, and, as soon as the sculptures were installed, fishes and plankton adopted them immediately.  The second path walked down by VAL to diversify her artistic approach was to integrate a new medium to produce her artworks. After some research, she opted for the glass of Murano, produced since the end of the 13th century by the venerable master-blowers on this Italian island located in the lagoon of Venice. During several months, VAL worked with these master-blowers in their workshop on the island. She submitted her drawings to them and intervened during the process when bronze elements were inserted into the glass being molded or when potassium powder was being injected. For the artist, it was a new approach: contrary to bronze sculptures, which are produced in a foundry on the basis of wax molds, the glass doesn't allow any mistake. The fabrication process of the glass, brought to a heat of 1,400 degrees, only lasts a few seconds. During the process, VAL intervened sometimes to change the initial idea, based on the inspiration of the moment. \"It is a mix between intuition and rigor\", she said.  Once in Thailand, the pieces were reworked through the addition of new elements, allowing to finish the artwork. The combination of bronze and glass opened the way to play with shades and light, with voids and reflections, bringing a new dimension to the artist's work. Glass was the tenth material used by VAL since her first experiences with clay. VAL's death, on 27 October 2016, occurred during the preparation of the exhibition of her works of bronze and glass.  The exhibition opened at the Red Sea Gallery in Singapore on 11 November 2016. VAL had wanted to name this exhibition The Tenth Eonian Initiative \u2013 an anagram for The Venetian Initiation.  The last major work of VAL was the most monumental and maybe the most accomplished. It is a masterpiece, 36 meters long and 4 meters 50 high, realized for a Taiwanese art collector and which was installed in 2017 in front of his residence on a hill overlooking the city of Taichung. This artwork is named Du chaos \u00e0 la sagesse (From Chaos to Wisdom)  and represents a sort of philosophical journey through which men are going during their life. \"It starts with a scene which is relatively chaotic, with sculptures which seem on the verge of falling down, characters who are under these and fear that the sky falls on their head. And then, there is a journey from going through the challenge to adopting an attitude of self-reflection\", VAL explained in an interview in April 2016.  The majesty of this initiation journey, the installation of the artwork in a superb location and the depth of the topic make it an exceptional artwork.  In February 2017, during an emotional ceremony at the Benchasiri Park in Bangkok, VAL's artwork Ville fantastique II was officially unveiled in presence of her family, her friends and her admirers. VAL and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric had decided in 2015 to donate this sculpture to the city of Bangkok. \"Our desire is to thank the city for everything she gave us and to root us stronger in this city of Bangkok we love\", said VAL while announcing the donation in 2015.  At the inauguration, Dr Jingjai Hanchanlash, president of Alliance Fran\u00e7aise of Bangkok, declared that \"VAL was born as a French, but died as a Thai\", although she did not have dual citizenship. In 2017, the renowned art critic G\u00e9rard Xuriguera wrote a seminal article on the artistic work of VAL. \"Val is one of these artists who believe in the everlastingness of the emotional charge of the visible. Since her beginnings, she creates very stylized humanistic sculptures, whose symbolic meaning is echoing what is most deeply buried in her. But what she aims above all to capture, as she underlines, are \"moments\", moments seized on the spot, which she inscribes in the perforated structure of her bronze armatures, of small, middle or large format, which are in accordance with her organizing pulsion and her quest for absolute\", he wrote.  During her whole career, VAL was carried by an inner force which guided her in her artistic work and which was linked, not only with nature, but also with the time-honored lineage of the sculptors that preceded her. It is this inner voice which she attempted to transcribe in these artworks, a voice asking questions, but never imposing certainties. At each stage, some progresses were done, some new paths were explored, VAL was advancing on her path or, as she liked to say, on her \"equilibrist\u2019s tread\".  As, for her, creating required boldness, it required to take risks, but, she said, it is when we take risks that \"we can feel the strength of life\". \"Creating is opening doors within oneself\", said Val. By sharing her creative works with a large public, the artist allowed others to open doors within themselves.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Internal wave\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Internal waves are gravity waves that oscillate within a fluid medium, rather than on its surface. To exist, the fluid must be stratified: the density must change (continuously or discontinuously) with depth/height due to changes, for example, in temperature and/or salinity. If the density changes over a small vertical distance (as in the case of the thermocline in lakes and oceans or an atmospheric inversion), the waves propagate horizontally like surface waves, but do so at slower speeds as determined by the density difference of the fluid below and above the interface. If the density changes continuously, the waves can propagate vertically as well as horizontally through the fluid.  Internal waves, also called internal gravity waves, go by many other names depending upon the fluid stratification, generation mechanism, amplitude, and influence of external forces. If propagating horizontally along an interface where the density rapidly decreases with height, they are specifically called interfacial (internal) waves. If the interfacial waves are large amplitude they are called internal solitary waves or internal solitons. If moving vertically through the atmosphere where substantial changes in air density influences their dynamics, they are called anelastic (internal) waves. If generated by flow over topography, they are called Lee waves or mountain waves. If the mountain waves break aloft, they can result in strong warm winds at the ground known as Chinook winds (in North America) or Foehn winds (in Europe). If generated in the ocean by tidal flow over submarine ridges or the continental shelf, they are called internal tides. If they evolve slowly compared to the Earth's rotational frequency so that their dynamics are influenced by the Coriolis effect, they are called inertia gravity waves or, simply, inertial waves. Internal waves are usually distinguished from Rossby waves, which are influenced by the change of Coriolis frequency with latitude.  Visualization of internal waves An internal wave can readily be observed in the kitchen by slowly tilting back and forth a bottle of salad dressing - the waves exist at the interface between oil and vinegar.  Atmospheric internal waves can be visualized by wave clouds: at the wave crests air rises and cools in the relatively lower pressure, which can result in water vapor condensation if the relative humidity is close to 100%. Clouds that reveal internal waves launched by flow over hills are called lenticular clouds because of their lens-like appearance. Less dramatically, a train of internal waves can be visualized by rippled cloud patterns described as herringbone sky or mackerel sky. The outflow of cold air from a thunderstorm can launch large amplitude internal solitary waves at an atmospheric inversion. In northern Australia, these result in Morning Glory clouds, used by some daredevils to glide along like a surfer riding an ocean wave. Satellites over Australia and elsewhere reveal these waves can span many hundreds of kilometers.  Undulations of the oceanic thermocline can be visualized by satellite because the waves increase the surface roughness where the horizontal flow converges, and this increases the scattering of sunlight (as in the image at the top of this page showing of waves generated by tidal flow through the Strait of Gibraltar).  Buoyancy, reduced gravity and buoyancy frequency According to Archimedes principle, the weight of an immersed object is reduced by the weight of fluid it displaces. This holds for a fluid parcel of density  surrounded by an ambient fluid of density . Its weight per unit volume is , in which  is the acceleration of gravity. Dividing by a characteristic density, , gives the definition of the reduced gravity:  If ,  is positive though generally much smaller than . Because water is much more dense than air, the displacement of water by air from a surface gravity wave feels nearly the full force of gravity (). The displacement of the thermocline of a lake, which separates warmer surface from cooler deep water, feels the buoyancy force expressed through the reduced gravity. For example, the density difference between ice water and room temperature water is 0.002 the characteristic density of water. So the reduced gravity is 0.2% that of gravity. It is for this reason that internal waves move in slow-motion relative to surface waves.  Whereas the reduced gravity is the key variable describing buoyancy for interfacial internal waves, a different quantity is used to describe buoyancy in continuously stratified fluid whose density varies with height as . Suppose a water column is in hydrostatic equilibrium and a small parcel of fluid with density  is displaced vertically by a small distance . The buoyant restoring force results in a vertical acceleration, given by  This is the spring equation whose solution predicts oscillatory vertical displacement about  in time about with frequency given by the buoyancy frequency:  The above argument can be generalized to predict the frequency, , of a fluid parcel that oscillates along a line at an angle  to the vertical:  .  This is one way to write the dispersion relation for internal waves whose lines of constant phase lie at an angle  to the vertical. In particular, this shows that the buoyancy frequency is an upper limit of allowed internal wave frequencies.  Mathematical modeling of internal waves  The theory for internal waves differs in the description of interfacial waves and vertically propagating internal waves. These are treated separately below.  Interfacial waves  In the simplest case, one considers a two-layer fluid in which a slab of fluid with uniform density  overlies a slab of fluid with uniform density . Arbitrarily the interface between the two layers is taken to be situated at  The fluid in the upper and lower layers are assumed to be irrotational. So the velocity in each layer is given by the gradient of a velocity potential,  and the potential itself satisfies Laplace's equation:  Assuming the domain is unbounded and two-dimensional (in the  plane), and assuming the wave is periodic in  with wavenumber  the equations in each layer reduces to a second-order ordinary differential equation in . Insisting on bounded solutions the velocity potential in each layer is  and  with  the amplitude of the wave and  its angular frequency. In deriving this structure, matching conditions have been used at the interface requiring continuity of mass and pressure. These conditions also give the dispersion relation:  in which the reduced gravity  is based on the density difference between the upper and lower layers:  with  the Earth's gravity. Note that the dispersion relation is the same as that for deep water surface waves by setting  Internal waves in uniformly stratified fluid  The structure and dispersion relation of internal waves in a uniformly stratified fluid is found through the solution of the linearized conservation of mass, momentum, and internal energy equations assuming the fluid is incompressible and the background density varies by a small amount (the Boussinesq approximation). Assuming the waves are two dimensional in the x-z plane, the respective equations are  in which  is the perturbation density,  is the pressure, and  is the velocity. The ambient density changes linearly with height as given by  and , a constant, is the characteristic ambient density.  Solving the four equations in four unknowns for a wave of the form  gives the dispersion relation  in which  is the buoyancy frequency and  is the angle of the wavenumber vector to the horizontal, which is also the angle formed by lines of constant phase to the vertical.  The phase velocity and group velocity found from the dispersion relation predict the unusual property that they are perpendicular and that the vertical components of the phase and group velocities have opposite sign: if a wavepacket moves upward to the right, the crests move downward to the right.  Internal waves in the ocean  Most people think of waves as a surface phenomenon, which acts between water (as in lakes or oceans) and the air. Where low density water overlies high density water in the ocean, internal waves propagate along the boundary. They are especially common over the continental shelf regions of the world oceans and where brackish water overlies salt water at the outlet of large rivers. There is typically little surface expression of the waves, aside from slick bands that can form over the trough of the waves.  Internal waves are the source of a curious phenomenon called dead water, first reported in 1893 by the Norwegian oceanographer Fridtjof Nansen, in which a boat may experience strong resistance to forward motion in apparently calm conditions. This occurs when the ship is sailing on a layer of relatively fresh water whose depth is comparable to the ship's draft. This causes a wake of internal waves that dissipates a huge amount of energy.  Properties of internal waves  Internal waves typically have much lower frequencies and higher amplitudes than surface gravity waves because the density differences (and therefore the restoring forces) within a fluid are usually much smaller. Wavelengths vary from centimetres to kilometres with periods of seconds to hours respectively.  The atmosphere and ocean are continuously stratified: potential density generally increases steadily downward. Internal waves in a continuously stratified medium may propagate vertically as well as horizontally. The dispersion relation for such waves is curious: For a freely-propagating internal wave packet, the direction of propagation of energy (group velocity) is perpendicular to the direction of propagation of wave crests and troughs (phase velocity). An internal wave may also become confined to a finite region of altitude or depth, as a result of varying stratification or wind. Here, the wave is said to be ducted or trapped, and a vertically standing wave may form, where the vertical component of group velocity approaches zero. A ducted internal wave mode may propagate horizontally, with parallel group and phase velocity vectors, analogous to propagation within a waveguide.  At large scales, internal waves are influenced both by the rotation of the Earth as well as by the stratification of the medium. The frequencies of these geophysical wave motions vary from a lower limit of the Coriolis frequency (inertial motions) up to the Brunt\u2013V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 frequency, or buoyancy frequency (buoyancy oscillations). Above the Brunt\u2013V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 frequency, there may be evanescent internal wave motions, for example those resulting from partial reflection. Internal waves at tidal frequencies are produced by tidal flow over topography/bathymetry, and are known as internal tides. Similarly, atmospheric tides arise from, for example, non-uniform solar heating associated with diurnal motion.  Onshore transport of planktonic larvae Cross-shelf transport, the exchange of water between coastal and offshore environments, is of particular interest for its role in delivering meroplanktonic larvae to often disparate adult populations from shared offshore larval pools. Several mechanisms have been proposed for the cross-shelf of planktonic larvae by internal waves. The prevalence of each type of event depends on a variety of factors including bottom topography, stratification of the water body, and tidal influences.  Internal tidal bores Similarly to surface waves, internal waves change as they approach the shore. As the ratio of wave amplitude to water depth becomes such that the wave \u201cfeels the bottom,\u201d water at the base of the wave slows down due to friction with the sea floor. This causes the wave to become asymmetrical and the face of the wave to steepen, and finally the wave will break, propagating forward as an internal bore. Internal waves are often formed as tides pass over a shelf break. The largest of these waves are generated during springtides and those of sufficient magnitude break and progress across the shelf as bores. These bores are evidenced by rapid, step-like changes in temperature and salinity with depth, the abrupt onset of upslope flows near the bottom and packets of high frequency internal waves following the fronts of the bores.  The arrival of cool, formerly deep water associated with internal bores into warm, shallower waters corresponds with drastic increases in phytoplankton and zooplankton concentrations and changes in plankter species abundances. Additionally, while both surface waters and those at depth tend to have relatively low primary productivity, thermoclines are often associated with a chlorophyll maximum layer. These layers in turn attract large aggregations of mobile zooplankton that internal bores subsequently push inshore. Many taxa can be almost absent in warm surface waters, yet plentiful in these internal bores.  Surface slicks While internal waves of higher magnitudes will often break after crossing over the shelf break, smaller trains will proceed across the shelf unbroken. At low wind speeds these internal waves are evidenced by the formation of wide surface slicks, oriented parallel to the bottom topography, which progress shoreward with the internal waves. Waters above an internal wave converge and sink in its trough and upwell and diverge over its crest. The convergence zones associated with internal wave troughs often accumulate oils and flotsam that occasionally progress shoreward with the slicks. These rafts of flotsam can also harbor high concentrations of larvae of invertebrates and fish an order of magnitude higher than the surrounding waters.  Predictable downwellings Thermoclines are often associated with chlorophyll maximum layers. Internal waves represent oscillations of these thermoclines and therefore have the potential to transfer these phytoplankton rich waters downward, coupling benthic and pelagic systems. Areas affected by these events show higher growth rates of suspension feeding ascidians and bryozoans, likely due to the periodic influx of high phytoplankton concentrations. Periodic depression of the thermocline and associated downwelling may also play an important role in the vertical transport of planktonic larvae.  Trapped cores Large steep internal waves containing trapped, reverse-oscillating cores can also transport parcels of water shoreward. These non-linear waves with trapped cores had previously been observed in the laboratory and predicted theoretically. These waves propagate in environments characterized by high shear and turbulence and likely derive their energy from waves of depression interacting with a shoaling bottom further upstream. The conditions favorable to the generation of these waves are also likely to suspend sediment along the bottom as well as plankton and nutrients found along the benthos in deeper water.

They are longitudinal waves, meaning that they propagate in the same direction as the energy they transport. They are quasilinear waves, meaning that they exhibit a certain degree of linearity, in that the displacement of the medium is related to the energy density in the wave by a simple formula, which is not the case for nonlinear waves. Internal waves are a type of wave that exists in a fluid that is completely surrounded by another fluid, and they are thus unable to escape the surrounding fluid. Internal waves can be generated by the movement of the fluids that surround them. An example is the internal waves that are generated when the Earth's upper ocean is influenced by the wind, or when a layer of fluid is displaced by a solid body that is moving through it. Internal waves are a type of gravity wave, meaning that they are influenced by the force of gravity, which acts between the two fluids. Internal waves are also influenced by the viscous forces that act between the two fluids. The viscous forces tend to dampen the waves, and they also tend to make the waves turbulent. The combination of the gravitational and viscous forces is what gives rise to the complex behavior of internal waves. Internal waves are important in a number of scientific fields, including oceanography, meteorology, and astrophysics.

Cineraria filiformis is the type species. The name Cineraria is derived from the Latin cinis, meaning \"ashes\", alluding to the greyish colour of the foliage. These are annual or biennial plants, 15\u201360 cm (6\u201324 in) tall, with Alternate leaves, basal and cauline, imparipinnate, with margins either undulate or crisped. The leaves are up to 15 cm (6 in) long, with the basal leaves being larger than the cauline leaves. The flowers are in a corymbiform inflorescence, with ray florets in shades of white, pink, or lavender. The receptacle is flat, with several rows of phyllaries. The anthers are cream-coloured. The style is about 5 mm (0.20 in) long, and the stigma is capitate. The fruits are achenes with pappi. The species are found in dry meadows, rocky slopes, and waste places. Cineraria is related to the genus Senecio. In the past, the species of Cineraria were commonly placed in the genus Senecio. The relationship between Cineraria and Senecio was reviewed by B.

One of these, Senecio sect. Cineraria, consisted of the species previously known as Cineraria. The other two were new sections, sect. Senecio variegata and sect. Oligoneuron. The species of Cineraria are not closely related to the species of Senecio that they were formerly confused with, and are not members of either of the two sections of Senecio that they were placed in. They are more closely related to the members of the tribe Senecionae that were formerly placed in the genus Pericallis. Cineraria species are used as food plants by the larvae of various species of Lepidoptera. Cineraria is a traditional remedy used in the Mediterranean region.

It is a short distance north of the tip of the Mull of Kintyre, which faces out towards Northern Ireland and the Atlantic.  Machrihanish bay The main sandy beach of Machrihanish Bay runs  north to Westport, providing opportunities for surfing. Basic accommodation is available for surfing groups in the Machrihanish village hall. There are static caravans, wooden wigwams and camping spaces at the Machrihanish Holiday Park. The village is one of the start/finish points of the Kintyre Way, one of Scotland's Great Trails. The Scottish Wildlife Trust's Largiebaan nature reserve lies to the south, about  along the Kintyre Way.  Features Campbeltown Airport, formerly RAF Machrihanish, is located near the village. Although still available to the Royal Air Force, the former airfield has been taken over by the specially-formed Machrihanish Airbase Community Company.  Coal was mined near the village; the Machrihanish Coalfield was one of Britain's smallest coalfields. A canal to Campbeltown was constructed between 1773 and 1794, later replaced by the narrow-gauge Campbeltown and Machrihanish Light Railway. Machrihanish railway station opened in 1906 and finally closed in 1932.  Machrihanish has a classic links golf course designed by Old Tom Morris, with views towards the islands of Gigha, Islay and Jura. A second, newer course has been built nearby called Machrihanish Dunes. This course is part of a multimillion-pound development by an American company, which has renovated the previously-dilapidated Ugadale Hotel in the village and owns the Royal Hotel on the sea front in nearby Campbeltown.  Weather data is collected from Machrihanish and broadcast in the Shipping Forecast.  Notable people Reginald Aubrey Fessenden built a radio transmitting station with a  high mast there in 1905 to transmit Wireless Telegraphy to a similar station at Brant Rock in Massachusetts, United States. An exchange of messages took place on 1 January 1906 but the mast blew down in a gale on 5 December 1906 and was never rebuilt.  Cadets from the Air Training Corps recreated this historic trans-atlantic transmission in Easter of 2006. Edinburgh and South Scotland Wing, who were on camp at the nearby airfield, contacted the Civil Air Patrol cadets in Brant Rock on 14 April 2006.  The views and skies seen from the beach and Lossit Point to the west were a subject for the Scottish marine and landscape painter William McTaggart, who had a house in the village.

It passed 79 statutes and adopted the Hoyt Code as the basis of the Territory's legal system.  Background The Indian wars were winding down, with most of Arizona Territory's native population pacified.  Following 1877 there would be periodic outbreaks of violence but no widespread conflict.  The reduction in violence was allowing the economy to boom. Prospectors had found and were developing a number of mineral deposits. Reduced Indian problems had allowed importation of sheep and cattle. Additionally, the Southern Pacific Railroad was being built across the territory.  Governor Anson P.K. Safford's education initiatives were prospering. A May 1876 census showed at least 1,450 of the territory's 2,955 children were literate.  Territorial school districts were also preparing to issue bonds to replace makeshift classrooms with larger structures better able to handle the growing demand.  The territorial legal code was in need of updating. To address this need, Territorial Secretary John Philo Hoyt had been commissioned to create a revised code based upon the \"Howell Code\" which was adopted by the 1st Arizona Territorial Legislature.  Legislative session The legislative session began on January 1, 1877.  Governor's address As with all his previous addresses, Governor Safford discussed the current situation involving the Indian Wars.  To this he added his concerns about outlaws.  Declaring highwaymen \"are a scourge to civilization, a disgrace to humanity, and should be swept from the face of the earth as remorselessly as the most ferocious wild beast\", he recommended highway robbery be made a capital crime.  The governor was able to report that the Yuma Territorial Prison was partially open, holding eight prisoners with a capacity for thirty.  Legislation The ninth session of the Arizona Territorial Legislature was unusually productive, passing 79 new laws.  The revised legal code drafted by the Territorial Secretary, dubbed the \"Hoyt Code\", was adopted as the basis of the territory's legal system.  Despite the previous session's permanently fixing the territorial capital in Tucson, the first action taken by this session was to move the capital to Prescott.  Other organizational changes included adjusting the northern boundary of Maricopa County, moving the seat of Mohave County to Mineral Park, and incorporating the City of Tucson.  In a related activity, residents of Grant County, New Mexico Territory had voiced a desire to have their county annexed to the Arizona Territory.  The legislature responded by petitioning the U.S. Congress to make the requested transfer.  To help deal with continuing lawlessness, the session authorized payment of a US$300 reward for the capture of two highwaymen who had robbed a stagecoach and its accompanying United States mail near Skull Valley on January 4, 1877.  They also authorized formation of another volunteer force to fight in the Apache Wars.  Other actions included imposition of a US$50 fine on anyone who allowed their hogs to run wild within a town.  Maricopa County was given permission to issue US$15,000 in bonds for a series of four roads radiating from Phoenix: one to Globe City, one to Yuma via Agua Caliente, and two routes to Prescott via Black Canyon and Wickenburg.  Finally, the session granted divorces to ten couples.

The session was also the first to be held by the legislature since the territory was granted its ability to elect members to the U.S. House of Representatives. The session began on September 4, 1871, and ended on November 8, 1871. The legislature was composed of twenty-one members, with twelve representing the Tucson District and nine representing the Prescott District. The session was marked by a number of important measures, including the creation of Pima County and the authorization of a ferry to cross the Colorado River at Black Rock. The session also saw the passage of a bill providing for the construction of a new territorial prison, which would be located in the Tucson District.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Japan underwent a period of rapid modernization. Many artists and writers began to question traditional Japanese art and culture, and to explore the relationship between art and society. This period of intellectual and artistic exploration came to be known as the \"Modernist\" movement. Hidekatsu was one of the leaders of the Modernist movement in Japan. He was a prolific writer and artist, and his work often featured bold, experimental styles. He was a strong advocate for the importance of art in society, and he often spoke out against the conservative, traditionalist art establishment in Japan. In the early 20th century, Hidekatsu's work began to be noticed and appreciated by international art critics and collectors. He was featured in many international exhibitions, and his work was acquired by museums and private collectors around the world. In the late 1930s, Hidekatsu's work took a more political turn. He began to use his art to criticize the Japanese military and government, and to protest against the increasing militarization and nationalism of Japanese society. During World War II, Hidekatsu was arrested and imprisoned by the Japanese government for his anti-war art and writings. He was released from prison in 1944, but he was rearrested and executed by the Japanese authorities in 1945. After the war, Hidekatsu's work was widely celebrated in Japan and around the world.

American career Hotchkiss was born in Watertown, Connecticut, and moved to Sharon, Connecticut in childhood; his early experiments were made there in his father's hardware factory.  Starting in the 1850s, he was employed as a gunmaker in Hartford, working on Colt revolvers and Winchester rifles.  Hotchkiss patented a line of projectiles for rifled artillery that were used extensively in the American Civil War.  French career   After the American Civil War, the U.S. government showed little interest in funding new weapons. In 1867, Hotchkiss moved to France and set up a munitions factory, first in Viviez, near Rodez, then in Saint-Denis, near Paris, named Hotchkiss et Cie. At about this time, he developed a revolving barrel machine gun (in French: \"canon-revolver\") known as the Hotchkiss gun; the gun was made in four sizes from 37\u00a0mm to 57\u00a0mm, the largest intended for naval use. After his death, the Hotchkiss company also developed in 1897 and later manufactured in large numbers an air-cooled, gas-actuated infantry machine gun which was widely used by several countries, particularly France and the United States during the First World War.  Personal life  On May 27, 1850, he married Maria Bissell Hotchkiss, who after his death founded The Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, Connecticut, and the Hotchkiss Library in Sharon.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"1634: The Ram Rebellion\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "1634: The Ram Rebellion is the seventh published work in the 1632 alternate history book series, and is the third work to establish what is best considered as a \"main plot line or thread\" of historical speculative focus that are loosely organized and classified geographically. The initial main thread is called the \"Western and North-Central Europe thread\" (encompassing northern and western Germany, Denmark, England, France, the Low Countries, Sweden and the Baltic); the second plot line, encompassing events in Italy, Spain, the Mediterranean region, and France, the \"South European thread\", and this book can be considered the starting novel of the \"South-Central/South-East thread\" being set in southern Germany, Austria, Bavaria, and Bohemia. This geographically organized plot thread actually began in Ring of Fire in Flint's novelette \"The Wallenstein Gambit\" which is set in Bohemia, Austria, and Germany, which tied into stories in various Grantville Gazettes.  Contents  The book is hard to classify as it is an oddity, as acknowledged by series creator Eric Flint in the foreword; an anthology in fact, with several longer novelettes sandwiching seemingly unrelated short stories under a (hidden for a while) overarching story line that is capped off by a short novel that finally brings all the seemingly unrelated and disparate contents together in the latter part of the book.  Unlike most works in the 1632 series, much of this book is written from the standpoint of common people \"in the street\", including Germans trying to cope with Grantville, West Virginia, up-timers trying to cope with their new world around Grantville, and both trying to deal with the problems of two widely different cultures meeting in the new United States of Europe. These merging dynamics are the milieu shaping stories Flint felt necessary to include even though they are set in 1631\u20131632. Their impact extends throughout the book and into 1634, as well as across political boundaries and battle lines as the historical imperatives developed in this book extend into the direct sequel 1634: The Bavarian Crisis.  Plot summary The book spot-covers local events and a few related diplomatic discussions from a few days after the Ring of Fire (May\u2013June 1631) to October in the fall of 1634\u2014giving it the largest time footprint of the four\u2014though narrowly focused. The short novel that concludes the work begins in late August 1633 and overlaps many of the shorter works earlier in the book. Two of the three other books set in 1634 refer to the events in the work (usually as the \"troubles in Franconia\") setting its canonical place in the \"greater\" neo-historical international politics covered in the other two works.  \"Recipes for Revolution\" The two Larkin \"Birdie\" Newhouse tales along with two flashback vignettes by Flint begin the Ram Rebellion book, all four set in the weeks immediately after the Ring of Fire. In the Flint stories which are sandwiched around the Birdie tales, Mike Stearns goes back to school under the tutelage of Melissa Mailey. Stearns has a problem, he has to get a handle on likely complications from the local population, as the stories are set just a few days after he is elected as Chairman of the Emergency Committee. As a result, Mailey gives Stearns several very thick history books on European history in the era.  Birdie Newhouse has an immediate problem, he's a farmer with most of his farm's arable land 300 years off and a continent away. The stories by Gorg Huff and Paula Goodlett explore the alien land practices and ownership of down-time Germany as Birdie seeks to gain additional lands. Land sales are rare; worse, the lawyers are in control and there are three general levels of vested interest: The owners-in-fact, a variable number of other claimants, and the tenants. The tenants have certain rights and obligations over and above monetary rent while leases are generally for the lesser of three generations or 99 years. In between the owner in fact and the tenants is usually a monetary transaction which gives the rents to any number of claimants\u2014depending upon the finances of the landholding family. The claimants all have a say in the farm operation to some extent, as do the occupants of the farm villages, which also have the right to disapprove or accept new co-farmers, for the land is farmed cooperatively with another set of obligations and entitlements. Birdie can't just go and buy a piece of land, he has to buy it from three different and diverse groups of people... and get them all to agree to terms. As the story notes, seventeenth century Germany was a lawyer's paradise.  \"Enter the Ram\" Flo Richards is a farmer's wife with four grown children who had bought a small flock of type C Delaine Merino sheep and some angora rabbits before the Ring of Fire in the hope that she'd see more of her youngest daughter, Jen, once she'd finished her studies out of town. The Ring of Fire had consequently left Jan behind in the present in which Flo dealt with this loss by concentrating on her livestock. She and her husband JD have local Germans living with them as partners now that farming has become more labour-intensive. Flo's laments about the poor quality wool from the locally obtained ram (who comes to be known as Brillo for that reason) strike a chord with someone and subsequently a number of 'Brillo fables' start to appear in the local broadsheet; the fables concern the titular ram escaping from his pen and interfering with her merino breeding program. The ram's fame spreads through Grantville out into the rest of Germany. The Women's League of Voters uses a Ram's Head as its emblem, schoolchildren sing songs about Brillo, and even adapt it into a ballet.  \"The Trouble in Franconia\" With the example of future Grantville, a peasant revolt becomes a revolutionary movement in the fractured Holy Roman Empire south and east of Thuringia while the Machiavellian maneuvers in the neo-historical governments and various field armies now dance to counter-act those aimed at the Americans' new heartland. Up-timers, from the original USA space-time want the serfs to succeed and liberate themselves\u2014but also know what a bloodbath the French Revolution became and various individuals act to help one and prevent the others. Avoiding that path will take all sorts of resources and efforts, and Americans from both uptime and down-time act resolutely to mitigate the problems, diplomacy to head off wars headed by authoritarians threatened by the new American ideals, and a deft appreciation of when not to fight and dangle an irresistible carrot instead.  \"The Ram Rebellion\" In Franconia, schoolteacher Constantin Ableidinger has been reading Common Sense by Thomas Paine. He also finds the Brillo stories interesting. The farmers in Franconia (and Thuringia for that matter) have a history of dissent concerning serfdom and Mike Stearns has hopes of getting some fundamental changes made in the way that Franconia is run as a result of a farmer's rebellion of sorts. He neglects to include this in the briefing given to the civil servants sent down to administer Franconia although these people, Johnny F. and Noelle Murphy, among others have an effect on the schoolteacher's \"Ram rebellion\".  Literary significance and reception Dana Blankenhorn of ZDNet called the book \"a sort of open source novel\" as a way of describing how Eric Flint invited other authors to contribute stories to this book in which it extends the franchise. Another reviewer wrote that \"the book gets mired down in detail. It was just too much information.\"  1634: The Ram Rebellion was listed on the Locus (magazine) Hardcovers Bestsellers List for two months in a row during 2006, topping at number 2.

The new government is based in 20th century Texas, which has not been affected by the war. As with the first novel, 1633, the story is told through the eyes of a young woman from the 20th century, in this case, a 25-year-old named Julie Magruder. During the events of 1633, Julie was captured by the New United States of America's military, the \"Selectors\", who have been tasked with identifying and eliminating any potential threats to the new nation. In the opening chapters of the novel, Julie is captured by the New United States of America's military, the \"Selectors\", and is being held prisoner and tortured. She is rescued by a group of Texas Rangers, who are also trying to flee the country. Julie and the Rangers escape to Mexico, where they join forces with the \"Republic of Texas\", a group trying to rebuild the former Texas Republic. After a series of adventures, Julie and the Rangers are captured by the \"Republic of Texas\" and placed in a labor camp. Julie is eventually able to escape the labor camp and make her way to the \"Republic of Texas\" capital, where she discovers that the \"Republic of Texas\" is being run by a Nazi officer who has been placed in charge of the country as part of a deal between the \"Selectors\" and the \"Republic of Texas\".", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 4543339}

It is part of the Bro Ardudwy Ministry Area.  History  Foundation As late as 1824, the parish church, St Mary's, Llanaber was the only Anglican place of worship in the area. At that time, the numbers of tourists and visitors was increasing and the Rector, Rev. T G Roberts, saw the necessity of building a new church for the English worshippers. So, in 1824, he convened a vestry meeting of the Churchwardens and the most influential church people of the district to discuss the advisability of erecting a Chapel of Ease. It was resolved to apply to the Bishop of Bangor for his permission, but the bishop only gave his assent on the condition that the cost of the building should be defrayed by voluntary subscription. The rector accomplished this task having immediately commenced collecting necessary funds.  Construction These efforts on behalf of the church were rewarded and on 4 December 1830 Reverend Roberts was able to submit a plan and particulars of the proposed sanctuary. The church designed by Edward Haycock of Shrewsbury is a neat Cruciform structure built in the later style of English architecture and contains accommodation for 470 people of which 230 places were to be free, in consideration of a grant of \u00a3300 from the Incorporated Society for Building and Repairing Churches and Chapels.  The church was built at the southern end of Barmouth, on a site that was formerly a ship building yard. At the time of the erection of the church there was a great deal of opposition to the site; the opposing faction contending that sand-drifts would make the approach practically inaccessible.  For some years after the erection of this church, sand-drifts did indeed prove a source of great annoyance to the worshippers. A resident of Barmouth, Mr Black (author of 'A Picturesque Tour') exclaimed that St David's Church was very badly situated. Over time, the effects of sand-drifts eased and then ceased altogether.  Support Among the chief supporters of the Anglican church in Barmouth in the 1830s and 1840s were a family called Ricketts who lived in Aberamffa House now modernised into Orielton Hall. In 1845, the Rector received a magnificent silver Sacrament Cup with the inscription 'The Offering of M. A. Rth' from Mrs Ricketts. The donation was accompanied by the following letter:  \"Dear Sir, Captain Barrow will deliver to you a case containing the Sacramental Cup which we were accustomed to lend to the Chapel at Barmouth, for the celebration of the Communion. It is my wish to make a gift of it in perpetuity and I shall be obliged to you to have it noted in the Parish Documents so that it belongs absolutely to the Church.\"  Extensions  19th century As time progressed it became very desirous that alterations should be effected and at a vestry meeting held to discuss the matter on 25 November 1886, it was resolved to build a new vestry - to have a wooden floor, a new approach at the north east corner and to have sundry other small alterations made at a total cost not exceeding \u00a3100.  Further additions and alterations were made over the course of the coming decades. The current altar was built in 1880, a font formed of five stone centre columns, was donated by Margaret and Edmund Humphreys and family and was originally placed by the main entrance. Mr Alex R Gibbs of London created and installed a wonderful stained glass window at the east end behind the altar in the 1880s.  20th century During the 20th Century, a 2 manual Nicholson Organ was installed. It was done in 1910, when a new room was constructed to contain all of the new Organ's water pressure pumping equipment. In 1974, Lady Russon, the High Sheriff of Merionethshire, donated oil painting copies of cartoons drawn by Raphael depicting the lives of St Peter and St Paul. The originals are housed at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.  Services From the time of its erection until the opening of St John's Church in 1895, English services were held in the morning and Welsh services at night.  St David's is not currently open as a place of worship with all services taking place at St John's Church.

Given a linear programming problem, the fundamental theorem states that the objective function can be written in the form max c'x where c is a vector of constants and x is a vector of variables, and the constraints can be written in the form ax = b where a is a vector of constants, x is a vector of variables, and b is a vector of constants. The fundamental theorem is useful because it shows that any linear programming problem can be reduced to a trivial problem of this form, so that any linear programming algorithm that works for this trivial problem will also work for the original problem. The proof of the fundamental theorem is an important example of an application of the theory of duality in linear programming. The fundamental theorem can be stated as a corollary of the following two theorems. The first theorem is that any linear programming problem can be recast in the standard form. The second theorem is the so-called primal-dual theorem, which is a basic result in linear programming that shows that every linear programming problem can be recast as a primal-dual problem, where the primal problem is the original problem and the dual problem is a trivial problem in which the objective function is the shadow price of the primal problem. The fundamental theorem is a corollary of these two theorems because the objective function in the fundamental theorem is the shadow price of the dual problem, and the constraints in the fundamental theorem are the constraints of the primal problem. The standard form of a linear programming problem is a form in which the problem is expressed using only the variables x and the constants a and b. In this form, the linear programming problem is to maximize a linear function c'x subject to the constraints ax = b and x >= 0. Here, c is a vector of constants (which will be used later), a is a vector of constants, b is a vector of constants, and x is a vector of variables. The primal-dual theorem states that for any linear programming problem, there exists a primal problem and a dual problem such that the primal-dual problem is equivalent to the original linear programming problem.

It is located just north of the Passamaquoddy Bay which is part of the Bay of Fundy, near the border with Maine, United States. The town of Chamcook, New Brunswick lies on the eastern bank of the lake and Chamcook Mountain is nearby. The lake has been notable within New England and Canada for its fishing.  Etymology Chamcook comes from the Passamaquoddy  word K'tchumcook which, according to William Francis Ganong, has many meanings but none are certain.  Geography Chamcook Lake is approximately  from Passamaquoddy Bay. The lake is connected by road to St. Stephen, New Brunswick. A Canadian Pacific Railway freight service station has been located at Chamcook Lake.  The lake is situated at  above sea level, and has a maximum depth of . The Chamcook River which feeds the Chamcook Lake rises from the cone shaped hill range of Mt. Chamcook. The Chamkcook harbour, a wet dock, lies is to the eastern side of the peninsular where development took place. It contains Odell Island in the southeast and Big Rock in the north. Despite its name, the Odell Island is larger than Big Rock. Approximately  to the north beyond Big Rock is a sister lake named Little Chamcook Lake. The Chamcook Lake watershed serves as a potable water supply for the Atlantic Salmon Federation, the St. Andrews Biological Station, the Champlain Industrial Park, and the town of St. Andrews.  The lake's red rock is feldspathic, of a brownish-red colour that weathers to brick-red, imperfectly syenitic, and showing some indications of an eruptive origin. A set of very fine petro-siliceous rocks, which are almost black, but have a perceptible purplish tinge are situated on the western shore.  The steep and solitary Chamcook Mountain overlooks the lake.  The mountain has a glacial rounded top scored with long scratches which indicate that a glacier from the northern highlands had grated its way across the mountain. The Chamcook Lake and the Chamcook mountain are both located in the Silurian belt of huge sandstones which has fossiliferous and volcanic formations in different sections.  Ecology After an advisory warning was issued in September 2010 for bloom of blue green algae, no detectable toxins were found in the town's drinking water supply, which comes from the lake, though officials continued to monitor the water supply.  Flora and Fauna  Chamcook Lake contains populations of Vitrea and in the 1930s a new species of Holopedium water flea (family Holopediidae) was discovered in the area. Lymnaea is found mainly along the lake's margin, composed chiefly of Isoetes echinospora; Sagittaria montevidensis; Potamogeton gramineus; Potamogeton spirillus; and the aquatic form of Hypericum boreale. Ground Cedar is found on the lake's dry bank and Isoetes echinospora is frequent along the lake's south margin.  The mushroom Boletus luridus Schaef. vermiculosus Pk has been found nearby. Of the Halophytes, Sagittaria latifolia, Sagittaria cuneata, Alopecurus aequalis, Glyceria borealis, Eleocharis acicularis, Acorus calamus, and Juncus pelocarpus are noted along the lake margins. The fern vegetation found on the lake's shores and along the stream which flows out from the Chamcook Lake to the sea are Diphasiastrum complanatum, Diphasiastrum digitatum,  and Isoetes echinospora.  In 1886, 200,000 salmon and salmon trout fry (young trout) were deposited in the lake. Fish species reported from the lake included sockeye salmon, steelhead trout and brown trout. During certain times of the year, it is said to contain heavy populations of sebago salmon. Studies conducted into the methylmercury concentration of eels from Chamcook Lake in the early 1970s indicated elevated levels of mercury in the lake's ecosystem, although brook trout from the lake revealed only 0.03 ppm.

It is located in the city of Saint John, roughly 4 kilometres (2 mi) west of the city's downtown core. The lake is a result of the creation of the St. John River, which was formed by the last ice age. Chamcook Lake is the location of the annual Interprovincial Regatta, which is held each year on the first Sunday of August. The regatta is attended by thousands of people each year, with participants from Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and New Brunswick. The lake is the site of the Chamcook Lake Lodge, a historic summer lodge built in 1929. The lodge was built in the same style as the better known and more expensive Algonquin Hotel in St. Andrews, NB. The Chamcook was built by a group of St. John business people as a more affordable alternative to the Algonquin. The lodge is now a condominium complex. In the summer of 2007, a local non-profit organization, the Chamcook Lake Protection Association, attempted to have the lake named one of Canada's Great Lakes. The lakes are a group of lakes, of which only five are not in Ontario. They are named for their large size, and are the largest lakes in their respective provinces. The criteria for being named a Great Lake is that a lake must be at least 100 square miles (260 square kilometres) in area, or have a minimum of 100,000 cubic kilometres of water. Chamcook Lake is 0.54 square miles (1.4 square kilometres) in area, and has 1,213,370 cubic metres of water.

The Georgia Constitution, like many other state constitutions, guarantees to its citizen the right to keep and bear arms. Article one, section one, paragraph VII of the Georgia Constitution states: \"The right of the People to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed, but the General Assembly shall have the power to prescribe the manner in which arms may be borne.\"  Summary table  Overview On June 8, 2010, Senate Bill 308 was signed by Governor Sonny Perdue reforming and clarifying many of Georgia's Gun Laws, while leaving certain restrictions in place.  Georgia is a \"shall issue\" state, with the Georgia Weapon's Carry License application to be submitted through the probate court of the county of residence. Applicants must be at least 21 years of age, unless they provide proof of basic training and service in the military.  According to the Georgia Department of Law, \"Georgia will recognize the weapons carry licenses, both resident and non-resident, from any other state provided that that state likewise recognizes a Georgia license.\" The states recognized under reciprocity include:  Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. A non-resident of Georgia to whom has been issued a firearm license by a state listed above may carry a firearm while in Georgia in accordance with Georgia law. This includes non-residents under the age of 21.  South Carolina H3799 was signed by Gov Haley on June 3, 2016, allowing reciprocity with Georgia WCL licenses.  There are a number of ways a firearm can be carried without a permit. No permit is needed:  To carry a firearm in a person's home, place of business, or vehicle  To carry a long gun in a fully open and exposed manner  To carry an unloaded firearm in a case  To carry a firearm in someone else's vehicle, provided you would qualify for a permit  To carry a firearm while fishing or hunting, if you have a valid fishing or hunting license  State preemption laws prohibit localities from regulating the ownership, transportation, and possession of firearms. Georgia also has a law preventing localities from enacting ordinances or lawsuits to classify gun ranges as nuisances.  This means that local parks, offices, etc. of non-Federal government agencies may not prohibit those with a valid Georgia Weapons License from carrying.  Federal regulations continue to prohibit carrying weapons on Corps of Engineers and US Postal Service property.    Firearm regulations are uniform throughout the state, and a firearms permit is valid throughout the state, in all areas other than in a few specially-defined areas. These specially-defined prohibited areas include: In a government building, where ingress into such building is restricted or screened by security personnel and overseen by a POST certified, sworn peace officer In a courthouse In a jail or prison In a place of worship, unless the governing body or authority of the place of worship permits the carrying of weapons or long guns by license holders In a state mental health facility On the premises of a nuclear power facility Within  of any polling place, only during an election. On school grounds (incl. building and grounds), unless carrying or picking up a student, or permitted in writing by an official of the school, however weapons may be securely stored in vehicles parked on school grounds.  As exceptions to the above list, a person may keep their firearm in a locked compartment of their vehicle at any of the above places except nuclear power facilities. Also, a person may approach security or management of any of the above places (except schools and nuclear power facilities) and ask them for directions on removing, securing, storing, or temporarily surrendering the weapon.  As of July 1, 2006, Georgia became a \"Stand Your Ground\" state, and requires no duty to retreat before using deadly force in self-defense, or defense of others.  Georgia law allows private firearm sales between residents without requiring any processing through an FFL.  A Kennesaw, Georgia city ordinance requires that all homeowners own a firearm and ammunition (Sec 34-1a). No one has ever been charged with violating this ordinance. An amendment exempts those who conscientiously object to owning a firearm, convicted felons, those who cannot afford a firearm, and those with a mental or physical disability that would prevent them from owning a firearm.  On April 23, 2014, Georgia's gun laws were again revised when Governor Nathan Deal signed House Bill 60, the Safe Carry Protection Act. The Safe Carry Protection Act changed many of the currently enacted gun laws in place beforehand.  In 2017, the Georgia legislature passed HB 280, which allows for concealed carry permit holders to carry concealed handguns on public college campuses. Governor Nathan Deal signed it into law on May 4, 2017.

The Outlaws planned to host two homestand weekends at the Revention Music Center in Houston's downtown Theater District. While their first homestand took place, all other homestand matches were canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  The Outlaws failed to make it past the quarterfinals in each of the three midseason tournaments of the season. Houston ended the season with a 6\u201315 record and were eliminated from postseason contention on September 3 after a 1\u20133 to the Boston Uprising in the North America play-ins tournament.  Preceding offseason  Sale of the franchise  On June 12, 2019, Immortals Gaming Club (IGC), the parent company of Immortals and the Los Angeles Valiant, acquired Infinite Esports, the parent company of Houston Outlaws and OpTic Gaming, marking the first major sale of any Overwatch League franchise. By OWL rules, one company may not own more than one OWL franchise; while Riot Games and Activision Blizzard approved the sale, IGC operated Valiant and Outlaws as entirely separate entities, with oversight by OWL representatives, until they sold the Outlaws.  On November 14, 2019, Beasley Broadcast Group announced the acquisition of the Houston Outlaws from Immortals Gaming Club. The purchase marked the company's third esports venture.  Organizational changes  In September 2019, the Outlaws released both head coach Kim \"TaiRong\" Tae-yeong and assistant coach Kim \"Hyunwoo\" Hyun-woo \u2013 both who had been in their positions since the team's inception in 2017 \u2013 after Houston's disappointing 2019 campaign. The following month, Houston signed Harsha Bandi, the former assistant coach of the Vancouver Titans and former analyst of the San Francisco Shock. Following, the team signed former Montreal Rebellion coach Chris \"Dream\" Myrick to their coaching staff.  Roster changes   The Outlaws enter the new season with three free agents, one player which they have the option to retain for another year, and six players under contract. The OWL's deadline to exercise a team option is November 11, after which any players not retained will become a free agent. Free agency officially began on October 7.  Acquisitions  The first signing for the 2020 season was on October 18, when the Outlaws signed DPS Jo\u00e3o Pedro \"Hydration\" Goes Telles, who had most recently played for the Los Angeles Gladiators. Three days later, the team acquired DPS Jeffrey \"blas\u00e9\" Tsang from the Boston Uprising. The following month, Houston picked up former Vancouver Titans flex support player Jung-geun \"Rapel\" Kim and former New York Excelsior flex tank Kim \"MekO\" Tae-hong. The team added former Seoul Dynasty support player Lee \"Jecse\" Seong-soo on January 2.  Departures  On October 17, the Outlaws announced that they would not re-sign free agent DPS Jung \"Arhan\" Won-hyeop, who had been with the team since its inception in 2017. The following month, on November 9, the team announced that they would also not re-sign main support Chris \"Bani\" Bennell. On December 7, flex DPS Jake \"Jake\" Lyon announced that was retiring from professional Overwatch competition. A month later, on January 14, off-tank player Matt \"Coolmatt\" Iorio retired as a player and moved to an organizational role with the Outlaws.

The class was open to lightweight sports cars powered by a 1300cc Ford Kent engine.  History The Formula F100 was launched by Geoff Clarke and the Motor Racing Stables racing school. Clarke also launched Formula Ford and thought that Formula F100 could be the sports car racing equivalent. The British press gave the F100 a far from warm welcome. The press feared the class would rival the popular Clubmans. The first season was dominated by Ray Allen driving a Royale RP4. The car was first powered by a Ford Kent engine. But when Nick Cole became the faster driver in a BMC powered Nerus Silhouette, Allen quickly changed engines. Former Formula 1 driver Les Leston came out of retirement to race in the series. The 49-year-old Briton was competitive towards the end of the season. The season started slow with few car counts, but at the end of the season there were 12 cars on the grid. The 1971 season was dominated by Tom Pryce. The young talent won eight of the 20 races. The series' final race at Brands Hatch on December 27, 1971 proved to be a farce as only one driver made the grid. The class eventually folded and the very popular Clubmans class prevailed.  Cars  The lightweight sports cars were built by various manufacturers. The Royale RP4, Merlyn MK 16, Aldon F100 and the Nerus Silhouette are examples of Formula F100 cars. Cars were fitted with a 1.300cc Ford Kent Crossflow engine. The engine was derived of the Formula Ford 1600. Despite the 300cc smaller engine, the cars were only slightly slower than Formula Ford due to their superior aerodynamics. All cars were fitted with spec Hewland transmission and Firestone tyres.

It is located in the Cascade Volcanic Arc, a series of volcanoes that stretch from the Canadian border to the state of Oregon. The peak is a shield volcano, which means it has a low profile and is more resistant to erosion than other types of volcanoes. It is also a cinder cone, which means it is made up of loose cinders and other volcanic material. The cinders were likely ejected from the volcano during its eruptions.

The organization works to rescue individual animals, safeguard populations, preserve habitat, and advocate for greater protections. Brian Davies founded IFAW. IFAW was instrumental in ending the commercial seal hunt in Canada. In 1983 Europe banned all whitecoat harp seals products. This ban helped save over 1 million seals. IFAW operates in over 40 countries.  History  The International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) was founded in 1969, in initial efforts to stop the commercial hunt for seal pups on the east coast of Canada.  With offices in 15 countries, and projects in more than 40, IFAW is one of the largest animal welfare organisations in the world.  The fund is supported by individual and major corporate donors, the latter including the Disneynature and the Disney Conservation Fund, the Petfinder Foundation and Arctic Fox, among others.  Activities IFAW partners with elephant and rhino orphanages in Zambia, Zimbabwe and India, where the focus is on rescue, rehabilitation, release, and post-release monitoring and protection. tenBoma is IFAW's counter-poaching initiative in Kenya, as featured on NBC's Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly and PBS NewsHour. tenBoma architect, IFAW Senior Vice President Lt Col Faye Cuevas, was honored as one of Motherboard's Humans of the Year in 2017. IFAW's Wildlife Crime program works to reduce demand for wildlife products, wildlife cybercrime and live animal exploitation and trafficking around the world. IFAW's Marine Mammal Rescue and Research group (MMRR) is a team of scientists, veterinarians and other individuals committed to promoting the conservation of marine mammal species (dolphins, whales, porpoises, and seals) and their habitats. Cape Cod is a hot spot for mass stranding activity, and the team is called on for expertise in global events as well. The Meet Us Don't Eat Us campaign aims to promote whale watching, as an alternative to whale hunting in Iceland. IFAW aims to protect the last 400 critically endangered North Atlantic right whales and has developed acoustic detection systems, collaborated with lobstermen, commercial fishers and shipping industries to prevent collisions with ships and gear entanglements; and advocated for greater legislation to protect the species. Through its DISRUPT wildlife crime prevention program, IFAW trains customs officers, game wardens and law enforcers in many countries to prevent the killing of endangered species. IFAW protects elephants by protecting critical elephant habitats, managing human-elephant conflict, preventing poaching, ending illegal ivory trade and rescuing orphan and injured elephants. Carrying out legislative and educational campaigns across the globe. This is an effort to try to prevent cruelty to animals, preserve endangered species, and protect wildlife habitats.  IFAW is best known for its leading role in the campaigns to end the commercial seal hunt in Canada and end commercial whaling, as well as its work to help dogs and cats in impoverished communities, protect elephants, end illegal ivory trade, rescue and release of wild animals such orphan rhinos and rescue of animals in the wake of disasters such as hurricane Katrina in the US.  Controversy and criticism  A financial manager of the Brian Davies Foundation, IFAW invested IFAW's money in organizations that carried out animal experiments, such as Bausch & Lomb, US Surgicals, Glaxo, Merck, Abbot, Upjohn, Philip Morris and McDonald's. When the investment was drawn to the attention of IFAW's trustees, the shares were sold immediately and the financial manager dismissed.    When Davies retired from IFAW in 1997 to start Network for Animals, IFAW established a payment schedule to use his name and image for fundraising and campaigns. The contract was important for the continued level of success that IFAW achieved with Davies' leadership, according to research on successful animal welfare organizations\". Davies had the following to say about it: \"I signed an agreement with IFAW which was conceived by the trustees. I was opposed to the idea of receiving remuneration from two animal welfare organisations; this solution allowed me to run Network For Animals without pay for seven years.\"  See also  Animal rights Animal welfare International Cat Day List of animal welfare organizations Petra Deimer, German marine biologist, nature conservationist, advisor to the fund  References  External links Charity Navigator Better Business Bureau Wise Giving Alliance  Charities based in Massachusetts Organizations established in 1969 Criticisms of bullfighting Animal charities based in the United States Abandoned animals Animal rescue groups Animal rights organizations", "machine_text": " The International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) is a global non-profit animal welfare organization with offices in over 30 countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, France, Spain, and South Africa.

History The name Erith comes from the Saxon \u2018Earhyth\u2019 meaning muddy landing place. It was traditionally a small port along the River Thames. In the 16th century King Henry VIII established a naval dockyard in Erith. It became a trading hub, as spices and cotton from the East Indies were delivered onto London. A naval storehouse was constructed at Erith in 1512 that was managed by the Keeper of the Kings Storehouses who was one of the Clerks of the Kings Marine a Tudor (naval administrator). Erith Dockyard was used as an advance base for routine maintenance before ships were transferred to Deptford Dockyard. It closed due to persistent flooding in 1521. However, according to naval historian Nicholas A. M. Rodger although Erith dockyard closed it was an important center of naval administration of the English Navy from 1514 into the 1540s.  Administration of the dockyard and other key officials The Master Shipwright was usually the key official at the royal navy dockyards until the introduction of resident commissioners by the Navy Board after which he became deputy to the resident commissioner. In 1832 the post of commissioner was usually replaced by the post of admiral superintendent.  Keeper of Kings Storehouse, Erith Post holders included:  1512-1524, John Hopton (also Keeper at Deptford Dockyard)  1524-1537, William Gonson (ditto)  Ships fitted out at the dockyard Included:  HMS Trinity Sovereign, also known as HMS Sovereign, an English warship in service built in 1488 and listed until 1521.

It was owned and operated by the London and India Docks Company, a subsidiary of the East India Company, from 1899 to 1909, and was then acquired by the Port of London Authority in 1909. It covered 25 acres (10 ha) and had three dry docks and one wet dock. The dockyard opened in 1899 and was built on a plot of land previously used for malaria research by the Royal Navy. The main dry dock was 365 feet (111 m) long by 67 feet (20 m) wide. The two eastern dry docks were smaller: No. 3 dock was 180 feet (55 m) long by 36 feet (11 m) wide and No. 4 dock was 151 feet (46 m) long by 33 feet (10 m) wide. The wet dock was 125 feet (38 m) long by 33 feet (10 m) wide. The dry docks were equipped with six steam cranes, each with a capacity of 20 tons, and one electric crane with a capacity of 5 tons. The London and India Docks Company went into voluntary liquidation in 1909, and the dockyard was taken over by the Port of London Authority. In 1913, it was proposed that the dockyard should be converted into a yacht harbour, but this idea was not implemented. In 1916, the PLA built a large shed, the \"Derrick shed\", on the site. In 1917 the Royal Flying Corps (later the Royal Air Force) took over the dockyard and used it as a base for the No. 1 (Erith) Wing of the Royal Flying Corps, which included No. 13 and No. 41 Squadrons. The Royal Flying Corps' engineering unit was also based at Erith. In 1919, the dockyard was returned to the Port of London Authority, and it was used as a base for the British & Irish Steam Packet Company (B&I Line). The B&I Line used the dockyard until 1924, when it moved its base to Liverpool. The Port of London Authority then sold the dockyard to the Lindsey Oil and Wax Company, which used it as a base for its marine operations. In 1926, the Port of London Authority constructed a new pier, the \"Woolwich-Erith Pier\", to link the dockyard to the Woolwich foot tunnel. In 1928, the dockyard was acquired by the L. Ross & Company, a group of shipbrokers and ship owners. It was used as a base for the Blue Funnel Line, the British & Irish Steam Packet Company, and the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company. In 1949, L. Ross & Company sold the dockyard to the Port of London Authority, which used it as a repair facility. The PLA also used it as a base for the London and North Eastern Railway's paddle steamers, the London, Tilbury and Santos Steamers, and the British Transport Commission's coasters. In 1968, the Port of London Authority sold the dockyard to a property company, which demolished most of the site to make way for a housing development. The housing development was not built, and the site was used as a storage yard until about 1990, when it was redeveloped as the Erith Westernised Marina.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 59623253}

An investigation by the Federal Trade Commission in 2014 determined that gDiapers' product claims of having \"green\" and \"eco-friendly\" baby products were deceptive and a form of false advertising.  Company history  gDiapers was founded in 2004 by Australian couple Jason and Kim Graham-Nye when they discovered they would be having a child, and they began looking for an alternative diaper option to reduce the environmental impact of disposable diapers. According to co-founder Jason Graham-Nye, the goal was to create \"the world's first hybrid diaper, essentially the best of cloth and disposable\" (diapers). In 2010, gDiapers won Green America's People's Choice Award for Green Business of the Year. gDiapers became a Certified B Corporation (Benefit Corporation) in May 2011, and later became a partner of a maternal health organization called Every Mother Counts.

The product was first sold in Austria, and is now also available in Germany, Switzerland, and the United States. The business was founded in 2006 by two Austrian entrepreneurs, Stefanusable and Alexander Welsbrugger. The idea to create a sustainable diaper that is kinder to the environment and baby's skin was born from Stefanuser's personal experience with his child's sensitive skin. The G in GDiapers stands for \"green\" and \"go\". The product is noted for using a \"hydrophilic film\" that allows the baby's urine to pass through the diaper to a cotton upper, which is then washed and reused.

The scheme was centred on the  long aqueduct which runs south to north bringing water to the city from Colognole.  This feat of engineering first carried water to the city in 1816, long before its completion.  It was Livorno's sole water supply until 1912, still serving some areas of the city.  The aqueduct was commissioned in 1792 by Ferdinand III, Grand Duke of Tuscany. Construction began in 1793 to plans drawn by the architect Giuseppe Salvetti, replacing an earlier aqueduct constructed in the 16th century by Ferdinand de' Medici.  Work stopped in 1799 on the death of Salvetti and, because of the political difficulties and upheavals in Tuscany caused by the first disruptive phases of the Napoleonic occupation of Tuscany, did not resume until 1806, when Maria Louisa, regent of Etruria, acting for her infant son, appointed the architect Riccardo Calocchieri to supervise the work. Later, in 1809, during the French occupation of Tuscany and reign of Elisa Bonaparte, Poccianti was appointed by the newly formed \"Comune of Livorno\" to oversee the project and under his direction work continued until 1824, the date usually considered as that of the aqueduct's completion.  However, modifications were always being implemented, and after Poccianti's death in 1858, the project was continued by his successor Angiolo della Valle.  The aqueduct crosses valleys in the Livorno Hills, supported on great arches which tower above the forests and slopes of macchie below.  Sources  F. Borsi, G. Morolli, L.

The aqueduct is 11.5 kilometers (7.1 miles) long and has a total capacity of 360,000 cubic meters (12,000,000 cubic feet) per day. The aqueduct is made of two main parts: the Acqua Lungara, which runs from the Villa Pamphili to the via di Villa Georgiana, and the Acqua Vergine, which runs from the via di Villa Georgiana to the Lake of the aqueduct of Pamphili. The aqueduct is a major source of water for the city of Rome and provides water to the neighborhoods of Villa Pamphili, Villa Borghese, and the Prati district. The aqueduct also provides water to the city's hospitals and to the Vatican City.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 68217978}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Harriet Ward\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Harriet Ward n\u00e9e Tidy (1808 \u2013 1873), was a British writer whose work is sometimes thought of as South African literature. She lived in the Cape Colony for a few years and her best-known books are set there: the non-fiction Five Years in Kaffirland and the fictional Jasper Lyle, the first English novel set entirely in South Africa. She also wrote articles for a military audience, unusually for a woman of that era. Her writing has stimulated discussion about whether or not she agreed fully with British colonial attitudes.  Personal life  She was born at Thorp, Norfolk in 1808 to Colonel and Mrs Francis Skelly Tidy, n\u00e9e Miss Pinder, daughter of the Chief Justice of Barbados. After school in France and London she married John Ward in 1831. He was a military officer from Waterford, Ireland and his wife accompanied him on various postings. They had one daughter, Isabel. The family lived together on St Helena in the late 1830s. In 1842 they travelled from Cork to the eastern frontier of the Cape and spent five years in the British colony there, at Fort Peddie and Grahamstown, in the so-called \"Ceded Territory\". Ward returned to Britain in 1848. This is when she started to publish full-length books, building on previous articles and short stories. The Wards may have lived in Dover before moving to Boulogne-sur-Mer in about 1851, but biographical details are scant. She died in 1873.  Writing  Her first published writing was in The United Service Journal and Naval and Military Magazine in the early 1840s. She began with articles about her father and later contributed reports about war and life in \"Kaffirland\", a British name for an area of the Cape Colony stretching from Kaffraria to Albany. (The name was based on the word Kaffir which the British used to describe the indigenous people of that region.) Ward developed an authoritative voice and was one of the first women whose work was treated as credible war reporting. Some of the writing she did in 1846 and 1847 formed the basis for the book which came out soon after her arrival in England in 1848: Five years in Kaffirland: with sketches of the late war in that country to the conclusion of peace: written on the spot.  This book was well-received in a period of public interest in the \"Kaffir War\" or War of the Axe. and ran to three editions. In the same year Ward's first novel, Helen Charteris, was also published but a reviewer complained that the main romance was \"encumbered\" by sub-plots.  Three years later her novel Jasper Lyle: a tale of Kafirland (sic) was more successful and was described in the Morning Post as \"truthful and popular\" with a \"fidelity and vivacity\" in its descriptions of \"Kaffir life and scenery\", \"giving it at the present moment an especial interest\". This too ran to three editions, plus two more in the 1870s after Ward's death and just before the Zulu War, when UK interest in South Africa was high.  Critics' interpretations of Ward's overall opinions vary. Some see her as \"stridently propagandist\" for British imperialism, particularly in her non-fiction writing about colonial South Africa, while others find more complex attitudes, for instance when the eponymous heroine of Helen Charteris is friendly with a Creole girl. Some believe Ward either felt unable to express unconventional views openly or held inconsistent attitudes without being particularly conscious of it. It has also been suggested she was offering a \"veiled critique\" or even deliberately expressing \"anti-colonial dissidence\". One critic thinks she wrote at first with \"full complicity in the prejudices of the frontier\" but later revealed a \"startling mismatch\" with this in her novels.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Yamatogoto\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The , also called  and , is a six- or seven-stringed plucked zither which, unlike the koto and other stringed instruments, is believed to be truly native to Japan, and not imported from mainland Asia. Both names translate literally to \"Japanese stringed instrument.\"  According to Shint\u014d myth as written in the Kojiki, the yamatogoto played an important role in the origins of Japan itself. In the myth, Amaterasu, goddess of the sun, is insulted by her brother Susano-o no Mikoto and hides in a cave, refusing to emerge. The world is therefore plunged into darkness. Amaterasu is eventually coaxed out of her cave by the goddess Ame-no-Uzume, who performs a dance outside the cave, to music provided by the twanging of six hunting bows. Amused by the music, and by the entertained sounds of the other gods, Amaterasu leaves the cave and returns to the firmament. The six bows are lashed together to form an instrument, and the first wagon or yamatogoto is born.  The instrument's form has changed very little since the eighth century. Similar in shape to the more commonly known koto, the yamatogoto is narrower, as it has fewer strings. Bridges are made from the natural forks of tree branches, particularly maple trees, according to tradition. Unlike many instruments, the yamatogoto's strings are not arranged in a scale, from low to high pitch, but in a preset melodic sequence which is played in rhythmic patterns. Another common playing technique involves a quick glissando across all the strings, with all but the last string played immediately muted with the hand, thus allowing only the last string to resonate.  Today, the instrument is used only in the Shint\u014d ceremonial/court music called gagaku, and even then it is not common. Nevertheless, its central role in Japanese mythology allows it to retain some reverence.

It was the first Japanese language GOTO to be developed, and is thus also called the \"original GOTO\". It was developed in the early 1900s by Japanese mathematician and computer scientist Kazuhito Kohjiro Kondo (\u8fd1\u85e4 \u548c\u4ec1, 1908\u20131998). The method was initially called the Kondo method, but was later renamed Yamatogoto. The first reference to this method in the literature was in a journal called \"Mathematics and Computation\" in 1970. The name \"Yamatogoto\" comes from the word \"Yamato\", which means \"Japan\" in Japanese, and \"goto\", which means \"relay\" in Japanese. The name thus means \"Japanese style relay\". The Yamatogoto style of GOTO is characterized by the use of the while loop instead of the unconditional branch found in more traditional GOTO implementations. The use of the while loop is similar to the use of the for loop in more modern imperative programming languages. The designers of Yamatogoto also incorporated the concept of \"dynamic labels\" into the language. A dynamic label is a label that is associated with a location in the program text instead of with a fixed position in the program. In addition to these changes, Yamatogoto also introduced the \"data flow diagram\", which is used to represent the flow of data through the program. The data flow diagram is similar to the flowchart, which is used to represent the flow of control through the program. The Yamatogoto style of GOTO has been influential in the development of other Japanese language GOTO dialects, such as JAL and JxAL. It has also influenced the development of the Pascal programming language.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2286630}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"1986 Philippine presidential election\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The 1986 Philippine presidential and vice presidential elections were held on February 7, 1986. Popularly known as the 1986 snap election, it is among the landmark events that led up to the People Power Revolution, the downfall of the presidency of Ferdinand Marcos, and the accession of Corazon C. Aquino as president.  Background  Influence of the American media  After being dared by an American journalist, President Ferdinand E. Marcos declared a snap election during an interview on the American Broadcasting Company political affairs programme, This Week with David Brinkley in November 1985. On December 3, the Batasang Pambansa (National Assembly) passed a law setting the date of the election on February 7, 1986. On February 4, 1986, Marcos declared February 6 and 7 as nationwide non-working special public holidays to \"give all registered voters fullest opportunity to exercise their right of suffrage.\"  The assassination of Senator Benigno \"Ninoy\" Aquino Jr. on August 21, 1983, revived the oppositionist press, and not far behind it did the pro-Marcos press retaliate. Both catered to the intense news-hunger of the Filipino people, but it was a smaller group of reporters who delivered the crucial blow to Marcos' image, with rumors circulating about Marcos' hidden wealth and war record. An example of this would be the article written by Eduardo Lachica in December 1982. It stirred interest after being published in The Asian Wall Street Journal on the alleged Marcos property holdings in New York.  By late January 1985, the pursuit for the truth behind the rumors began with Lewis M. Simons, a Tokyo-based correspondent for the San Jose Mercury News, who sent a memo to his desk editor, Jonathan Krim. There had been incessant speculations of Philippine \"capital flight\" that not only involved Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos themselves, but also government officials and friends of the first family. Simons provided Krim with a list of names, telling him to look into Philippine investments in the San Francisco Bay area. Krim handed over several clips (including Lachica's article) and miscellaneous letters from the Filipino exile community to the investigative reporter attached with a note, \"Look into this.\" Carey began his paper trail after setting up his personal computer and a telephone modem as well as using real-estate data bases to acquire both California and out-of-state records. Another method he used in tracking the story were his interviews with the members of the Filipino exiled opposition who were divided between those who were resolute in helping him and those who deemed themselves apolitical, fearing reprisals if they spoke. In an interview, Carey says, \"I kept telling them, 'I'm not interested in quoting people, I'm not going to use yours or any names. I'm interested in documentary evidence,' That convinced people....\" Due to budgetary concerns, he continued his trail by exploring records in New York and Chicago through telephone. At a later date, Katherine Ellison from the San Francisco Bureau, who Carey dubs as another \"great investigative reporter,\" joined the group as they conducted interviews and convinced reluctant locals to provide essential information.  On June 23\u201325, 1985, the Mercury News series under the by-lines of Carey, Ellison, and Simons elicited a staggering response after revealing a list of names, showing how the Filipino elite had illegally invested millions in the U.S., why real estate conditions made California a prime investment territory, and how capital flight fueled Philippine insurgency. Meanwhile, local publications in the Philippines such as Malaya, Veritas, Business Day, and Mr. and Mrs. all reprinted the series. There were protests on the streets, attempts by the National Assembly's opposition minority to file an impeachment hearing  (which was quickly annulled) while Marcos was forced to order an impartial inquiry (though it lasted briefly).  The international clamor surprised the three Mercury News investigators with Carey commenting, \"There's a vast difference between simple allegations and something with a factual, documentary basis,\" he says. \"It provokes a totally different psychological reaction in the readers. Gossip stirs their apathy; facts galvanize them to action.\"  After the successful publication of the series, newer articles were produced by the Mercury News team, among other things, such as how the Manila elitists smuggled fortunes, in the form of American currency, out of the country. More reporters from The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, and The New York Times developed other angles as well. The most significant were those uncovered by Times' Jeff Gerth, who wrote on the misuse of American aid money by the Marcos' administration. Although Marcos continued to deny these allegations, it did little to avert the consequences. His support in the congress quickly dissipated while news of his misrule endangered U.S. military interests. Though revelations of Marcos' hidden wealth disparaged him in America, in the Philippines, it was the truth of his war records that did him in.  Organizing the 1986 Philippine elections  On November 4, 1985, Sam Donaldson and George Will interviewed President Marcos on the American Broadcasting Company political affairs program This Week with David Brinkley. Marcos was being asked about his policies and support when, without warning, he announced that he would hold a snap election on February 7, 1986, a year earlier than the supposed 1987 election. Marcos said that in the snap election, the vice president would also be determined. Also, the final decision regarding the election would be determined by the National Assembly. On December 3, 1985, the Batasang Pambansa passed a law setting the date of the election on February 7, 1986.  Marcos declared the early elections since he believed that this would solidify the support of United States, silence the protests and criticisms both in the Philippines and the United States, and finally put the issues regarding the death of Benigno Aquino Jr. to rest.  The opposition saw two problems regarding the announcement of Marcos. First is the credibility of the announcement since at the time two-thirds of the National Assembly were from Kilusang Bagong Lipunan, which means that they could decide not to push through with the snap election. This would then give Marcos an image that he was willing to entertain opposition, which would then contribute to his popularity. Second problem is that the opposition was yet to choose a single presidential candidate to who had a chance to win. This posed a problem for them since the opposition were yet to be united, supporting only one presidential candidate.  The opposition, was divided between the widow of Benigno Aquino Jr., Corazon \"Cory\" Aquino, and Doy Laurel, son of President Jose P. Laurel. Cardinal Jaime Sin talked to both the potential candidates. Aquino was hesitant to run since she believed that she was not the best and most able choice. Aquino said she would be willing to run if there was a petition campaign with at least a million signatures supporting her as a presidential candidate. Doy on the other hand, was earnest in running as president since he believed his family background, training, and experience had prepared him for the presidency.  Campaign The campaign period lasted 45 days, from December 19, 1985, to February 5, 1986.  As the election campaign continued, Marcos was able to campaign in selected key cities while Aquino was able to campaign intensively and extensively, even going to remote places from the north of the Philippines to the south of the Philippines. The Aquino campaign concluded a rally that is believed to have 800,000 participants wearing yellow in Rizal Park and Roxas Boulevard forming a \"sea of yellow\".  Results About 85,000 precincts opened at seven o'clock in the morning of Election Day. Each precinct was administered by a Board of Election Inspectors (BEI), which was tasked to oversee voting. The BEIs did not continuously abide by the stipulated voting procedure, which raised the impression of fraud.  The voting period was also scheduled to close at three o'clock in the afternoon but was extended to give way for people who were in line. Counting of the ballots followed and in most precincts was able to finish by six o'clock in the evening.  Results showed that a huge percentage of eligible electorates did not vote. Out of the 26 million registered voters, only 20 million ballots were cast. This showed a decreased percentage of voters from the 1984 election, which had 89% of registered voters cast their ballots, to around 76% during the snap election.  A number of disenfranchised voters were evident during the snap election.  COMELEC tally  President   The COMELEC proclaimed Marcos as the winner, receiving more than 1.5 million votes more than the next contender, Cory Aquino. In the COMELEC's tally, a total of 10,807,197 votes was for Marcos alone. Conversely, NAMFREL's partial tally had Aquino leading with more than half a million votes.  Vice President  NAMFREL tally  Aftermath  The final results of the February 7, 1986, snap election led to the popular belief that the polls were tampered and considered an electoral fraud. The following days consisted of countless debates and actions as a sign of aversion to the result. But in the end, according to the International Observer Delegation, the \"election of the February 7 was not conducted in a free and fair manner\" due to the influence and power of the administration of Ferdinand Marcos.  The International Observer Delegation reaffirmed that the proclamation of the victors of the election were invalid because the Batasan \"ignored explicit provisions of the Philippine Electoral Code [Batas Pambansa Blg. 881] requiring that the tampered or altered election returns be set aside during the final counting process, despite protests by representatives of the opposition parts\". After further investigation, a multinational team of observers cited cases of vote-buying, intimidation, snatching of ballot boxes, tampered election returns and the disenfranchisement of thousands of voters.  On February 9, thirty-five computer programmers walked out of the COMELEC's electronic quick count at the Philippine International Convention Center, some fearing for their safety and seeking sanctuary in Baclaran Church. The technicians\u2014whose protest was broadcast live on national television\u2014claimed that the Marcos camp had manipulated the election results.  The Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines President Cardinal Ricardo Vidal released a declaration stating that \"a government does not of itself freely correct the evil it has inflicted on the people then it is our serious moral obligation as a people to make it do so.\" The declaration also asked \"every loyal member of the Church, every community of the faithful, to form their judgment about the February 7 polls\" telling all the Filipinos \"[n]ow is the time to speak up.  Now is the time to repair the wrong.  The wrong was systematically organized.  So must its correction be.  But as in the election itself, that depends fully on the people; on what they are willing and ready to do.\" The United States Senate passed a resolution stating the same. This chain of events eventually led to the resignation of Marcos' Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile, and Armed Forces Vice-Chief of Staff General Fidel Ramos. Enrile and Ramos then secluded themselves in the military and police headquarters of Camp Aguinaldo and Camp Crame, respectively, leading to the People Power Revolution from February 22 to 25, 1986, which toppled the Marcos regime.  Honored individuals   A number of individuals who were killed in an effort to protect the integrity of the 1986 Philippine presidential election have been formally honored as \"heroes\" at the Philippines' Bantayog ng mga Bayani (lit. 'Monument of Heroes'). These include Jeremias de Jesus, Evelio Javier, Francisco Laurella, Salvador Lea\u00f1o, Fernando Pastor Sr., and Michael Sumilang.

The agency was created on 1 April 2017 from an amalgamation of Arts NSW (ANSW) and Screen NSW. Create NSW is responsible for administering government policies that support the arts, artists and the various cultural bodies within the state of New South Wales in Australia, and for the provision of funding. It also provides secretarial and administrative support to the Arts & Culture Advisory Committee, a high-level committee which works with the government to help shape policy and promote the arts throughout the state.  , the executive team is headed by Kate Foy (Deputy Secretary, Community Engagement), Chris Keely (Executive Director, Create NSW) and Grainne Brunsdon (Head of Screen NSW). The agency advises the Minister for the Arts, currently The Hon. Ben Franklin . Ultimately, the Minister is responsible to the Parliament of New South Wales.  History  Arts minister role The role of an \"arts\" minister, overseeing the management and support for all cultural activities in New South Wales, before the early 1970s was an unheard of concept in politics. However, by the early 1970s, various governments in Australia recognised the need for a steering authority for state support for the arts. In response, premier Bob Askin appointed George Freudenstein as the first Minister for Cultural Activities on 11 March 1971. On his appointment Freudenstein requested the establishment of an organisation to enable him to carry out his responsibilities and the Premier agreed. On 13 May 1971 the Ministry of Cultural Activities was established, taking over responsibility for various legislation and bodies that had previously been under the purview of the Department of Education, including the Archives Office of New South Wales, Art Gallery of New South Wales, State Library of New South Wales, Australian Museum, Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences, Sydney Observatory, the Advisory Committee on Cultural Grants, NSW Film Council, and the Sydney Opera House Trust. In the case of the opera house, the Ministry had responsibility for its completion and final official opening on 20 October 1973.  With Freudenstein's departure on 3 January 1975, a new Minister for Culture, Sport and Recreation was appointed and on 6 January 1975, the Ministry of Cultural Activities was replaced by the new Department of Culture, Sport and Recreation. This arrangement lasted until 14 May 1976 when the new Labor Government of Neville Wran transferred the responsibility for cultural activities to the Premier's Department. This became the Cultural Activities Division under the administration of the Premier himself. This situation continued until 1984, when Wran established the Office of the Minister for the Arts within the Premier's Department and commissioned himself with the title of Minister for the Arts.  On 15 June 1988 a Ministry for the Arts independent of the Premier's Department was established.  2006: Arts NSW created This Ministry for the Arts was abolished on 3 March 2006 and its responsibilities were moved to the new Department of the Arts, Sport and Recreation.  Arts NSW became the new dedicated division for the Minister, and it transferred to \"Communities NSW\" in July 2009 and then the Department of Trade and Investment, Regional Infrastructure and Services from 4 April 2011. From the appointment of Troy Grant as the Minister in 2014, Arts NSW fell within the Department of Justice.  Between 2014 and 2020, the organisation was shuffled through four departments.  2017: Create NSW Create NSW was created via an amalgamation of Arts NSW and Screen NSW on 1 April 2017. The Screen NSW banner was removed, CEO Courtney Gibson left the role, and Michael Brealey, then acting executive director of Arts NSW, became CEO of the new agency. In April 2017, an arm of Create NSW was established (Create Infrastructure) dedicated to the planning and delivery of cultural infrastructure.  The agency fell within the Arts, Screen and Culture Division of the Department of Planning and Environment (abolished on 1 July 2019) at the time of the publication of its 2018 Cultural Infrastructure Plan 2025+. As a result of a government restructure in April 2019 after a state election, Create NSW was moved to the Minister for the Public Service and Employee Relations, Aboriginal Affairs, and the Arts, then held by Don Harwin and administered through the Community Engagement portfolio of the Department of Premier and Cabinet headed by Deputy Secretary, Community Engagement, Clare Foy.  On 28 June 2019, Harwin announced a revamp to the process of application, assessment and delivery of NSW arts funding. The main differences, largely driven by the findings of the 2018 NSW Arts Summit, Arts 2025, were: a streamlined approach that consolidated the existing 14 funding rounds into two annual calls for funding; a reduction in the assessment criteria for funding applications from 26 to 3; and replacement of the cross-sector peer review panels by ten new \"Artform Assessment Boards\". In addition, the requirement that an organisation had to receive project funding for three consecutive years in order to qualify for annual funding was dropped.  In September 2019, a restructuring of the leadership team of Create NSW led to the resurrection of the Screen NSW brand, and Grainne Brunsdon appointed head of that team, which remains part of Create NSW.  Structure, role and activities  Role and organisational structure Create NSW is \"the NSW Government\u2019s arts, screen and culture development, policy and infrastructure planning and delivery body\". Between 2019 and 2021 the agency was responsible to the Minister for the Public Service and Employee Relations, Aboriginal Affairs, and the Arts and was administered through the Department of Premier and Cabinet. It was one of five branches of the Community Engagement Group within the department. In a rearrangement of the Perrottet ministry, Create NSW was transferred to the newly established Enterprise, Investment and Trade cluster and a Minister for the Arts established to guide the agency's direction.  It also provides secretarial and administrative support to the Arts & Culture Advisory Committee, a high-level committee which works with the government to help shape policy and promote the arts throughout the state.  , the executive team is headed by Kate Foy (Deputy Secretary, Community Engagement), Chris Keely (Executive Director, Create NSW) and Grainne Brunsdon (Head of Screen NSW), along with seven other members of the team.  Also under the arts portfolio are statutory authorities of the Sydney Opera House, Australian Museum, Art Gallery of NSW, State Library of NSW, Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences (MAAS), and Sydney Living Museums and the State Archives and Records Authority (SARA, aka NSW State Archives and Records), but these are separate from Create NSW.  Infrastructure and properties , Create NSW's infrastructure redevelopment projects included: Theatre Royal, the Australian Museum, Riverside Theatres, the new Powerhouse Museum, Sydney Opera House renewal, expansion of the Art Gallery of NSW (\"Sydney Modern Project\"), and Walsh Bay Arts Precinct. The Regional Cultural Fund is also under infrastructure.  , Create NSW managed nine properties in and around the Sydney CBD: Carriageworks multi-arts centre, the former Darlinghurst Gaol, the Walsh Bay Arts Precinct (including Wharf 4/5), the Roslyn Packer Theatre, the Parachute Ground at Lilyfield, The Gunnery, Garry Owen House, and the Arts Exchange in The Rocks area.  Arts organisations and festivals The NSW performing arts sector includes 11 of Australia\u2019s major performing arts organisations, including The Australian Ballet, Australian Brandenburg Orchestra, Australian Chamber Orchestra, Bangarra Dance Theatre, Bell Shakespeare Company, Belvoir, Musica Viva Australia, Opera Australia, Sydney Dance Company, Sydney Symphony Orchestra, and the Sydney Theatre Company.  Create NSW provides support for four major cultural festivals: the Biennale of Sydney, the Sydney Festival, the Sydney Film Festival, and the Sydney Writers' Festival. In collaboration with the federal government through the Visual Arts and Craft Strategy (VACS), Create NSW helps to support the careers of artist, craft practitioners and arts professionals such as curators, through programs at the Australian Centre for Photography, Art Gallery of NSW, Sydney Biennale, dLux MediaArts, Artspace Visual Arts Centre (housed in The Gunnery), the Australian Design Centre and the Museum of Contemporary Art Australia.  Funding for the arts in NSW Because of the changes in name and organisational structure over the years, funding by Create NSW is difficult to track, but in 2013\u201314, Arts NSW allocated  million to arts and cultural development, and in 2018\u20139,  million in arts grants. In addition, the 2018\u20139 Cultural Infrastructure Plan allocated  million to the new Powerhouse Museum in Parramatta,  and large amounts to the Walsh Bay Arts Precinct, Art Gallery of NSW\u2019s Sydney Modern Project, Sydney Opera House renovations, the Riverside Theatres redevelopment, the Regional Cultural Fund, and expansion of the Australian Museum, totalling  billion on infrastructure. After so much spending on buildings, there was less left for spending on either commissions by artists or emergencies. Owing to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia, special sector support packages were provided by the governments of South Australia ( million), Queensland ( million) and Victoria ( million), while  Create NSW had only redirected  million of its existing budget to support the arts during the crisis.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Killybegs\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Killybegs () is a town in County Donegal, Ireland. It is the largest fishing port in the country and on the island of Ireland. It is located on the south coast of the county, north of Donegal Bay, near Donegal Town. Its Irish name Na Cealla Beaga means 'little cells', a reference to early monastic settlements. The town is situated at the head of a scenic harbour and at the base of a vast mountainous tract extending northward. In the summer, there is a street festival celebrating the fish catches and incorporating the traditional \"Blessing of the Boats\". , the population was 1,236.  History  In 1588, Killybegs was the last port of call for the Spanish vessel La Girona, which had dropped anchor in the harbour when the Spanish Armada fetched up on the Irish coast during Spain's war with England. With the assistance of a Killybegs chieftain, MacSweeney Bannagh, the Girona's personnel were fed, her rudder repaired, and she set sail for Scotland, but was wrecked off the Antrim coast with the loss of nearly 1,300 lives.  The railway line opened on 18 October 1893 on the Donegal Railway Company line from Donegal to Killybegs railway station.  The Donegal Town to Killybegs branch of the County Donegal Railway terminated at the harbour and some of the remains can still be seen to this day. The railway was closed on 1 January 1960.  Fishing industry  Killybegs is a natural deepwater harbour with a depth of 12 metres at low water spring tide at the new \u20ac50 million pier completed in 2004. The harbour is home to all the largest Irish midwater pelagic trawlers and a modest whitefish fleet, but it handles many other types of shipping as well. These include passenger cruise liners and mixed specialist cargoes. In recent years Killybegs has become the favoured port for the importation of wind turbines and is a service port for the offshore gas/oil drilling rigs.  The town is the centre of the Irish pelagic fishing and processing industries, as it specialises in the processing and freezing of species such as mackerel, herring, scad, and blue whiting.  The finished processed fish is exported to markets in Africa, the Middle East and Europe by freezer ships. However, due to blanket enforcement of EU fishing regulations on Irish vessels by the Irish Department of the Marine, starting in 2005, and mackerel shoals remaining longer in Norwegian waters, there has been a downturn in the fishing industry in the town.  This has led to redundancies in the fish processing industry, in which the fish factory workers have been the hardest hit.  Education  The first national school, known as 'Killybegs National School', and later as the 'Commons National School', opened in 1834 on a site originally provided by the Plantation Commissioners in the reign of King James I There are three national schools and one second-level school in Killybegs as well as a third level institution Tourism College Killybegs, the only dedicated tourism institute in Ireland, offering courses in hospitality and culinary skills. The college has been academically integrated with Letterkenny Institute of Technology since 2001.  St Catherine's Vocational School is a non-denominational, co-educational second-level school. There are twenty-six teaching staff, five special needs assistants and three support staff. The student population is 348 and the male-to-female student ratio is approximately 50:50. The present two-storey building opened in 1987 provides facilities for students, teachers and members of the community. St Catherine's has a range of extracurricular activities, the school has had success in English, Irish and science debates. The arts are well provided for with an art and music department, the music department has staged a number of musical productions, students are taught a variety of instruments. Sport is also an important aspect of school life students participate in teams representing the school in soccer, Gaelic football, athletics, basketball and rugby.  Beach  Fintra beach (registered blue flag) is located on the outskirts of Killybegs town. It consists entirely of fine golden sand and receives large numbers of day-trippers during the peak of the tourist season. It is lifeguarded throughout the bathing season.  Donegal Carpets  Killybegs is famous for its tapestries and carpets, some of which were produced on the biggest carpet loom in the world at the \"Donegal Carpet Factory\". The carpets, known as Donegals, are hand-knotted in the Turkish style. The carpets have adorned many important buildings in Ireland such as Dublin Castle, the Royal Hospital Kilmainham, \u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in and internationally the Vatican, The White House, Buckingham Palace, 10 Downing Street and most state buildings around the world. The factory in Killybegs closed in 2003 and has been open since 2006 as the Maritime & Heritage Centre.  The Centre provides information on the carpet making and the fishing industry. Tours are conducted daily and visitors can watch smaller carpets being made and try making a knot.  Sport  The local GAA club is Na Cealla Beaga. They play their home games at Eamon Byrne Memorial Park.  The local association football club, St Catherine's, was founded in 1896. They play their home games at Emerald Park.  Killybegs Rowing Club can often be seen training in the harbour during the summer months and hold an annual regatta on the last weekend of July. The club row the Donegal Skiff, the traditional skiff of the county.  Killybegs in literature  Killybegs Authors: John C.

It is the largest fishing port in Ireland and is often referred to as the \" busiest fishing port in Europe\". The town is situated on the south coast of the county, on the Atlantic Ocean, near the mouth of the River Fintown (or Finvoy). The town's name is derived from the Irish words _C\u00e9al_ (pron. \"kaal\") meaning \"sheltered\", and _Beag_ (pron. \"beg\") meaning \"small\". Killybegs was once the central base of the Irish fishing industry, but due to overfishing and severe depletion of the fish stocks, the industry has experienced a dramatic decline. The town's dependence on the fishing industry has made it vulnerable to the ups and downs of the fishing trade and the loss of a large number of jobs has caused the population to decrease significantly in recent years. In the 2006 census, the population of the town was 1,232. The 2011 census recorded a population of 1,068. There is evidence of ancient settlement in the area. A number of ringforts and passage graves are in the vicinity of the town. The ruins of the early Christian church of Kilteevoey are near the town. The church is built on the site of an earlier monastery, founded by an order of nuns in the 6th century. The monastery was dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and the nuns were known as the \"Sisters of the Final End\". Killybegs is a sheltered natural harbour. In the 18th and 19th centuries, it was a major fishing port, primarily because of its proximity to the rich fishing grounds of the Donegal Bay and the Irish Sea. During the Second World War, Killybegs was a base for the Royal Navy's Atlantic convoys. In recent times, Killybegs has become a popular tourist destination. There are a number of hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation in and around the town. The town also has a fine 18th-century church, which was built by the Franciscans. The town's central location makes it a good base for exploring the south and west of County Donegal.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 996575}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Ars Electronica\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Ars Electronica Linz GmbH is an Austrian cultural, educational and scientific institute active in the field of new media art, founded in Linz in 1979. It is based at the Ars Electronica Center (AEC), which houses the Museum of the Future, in the city of Linz. Ars Electronica's activities focus on the interlinkages between art, technology and society. It runs an annual festival, and manages a multidisciplinary media arts R&D facility known as the Futurelab. It also confers the Prix Ars Electronica awards.  History  Ars Electronica began with its first festival in September 1979. Its founders were Hannes Leopoldseder, Hubert Bognermayr, Herbert W. Franke, and Ulrich R\u00fctzel. The festival was held biennially at first, and annually since 1986. The Prix Ars Electronica was inaugurated in 1987 and has been awarded every year since then. Ars Electronica Linz GmbH was incorporated as a limited company in 1995. The Ars Electronica Center, together with the Futurelab, opened in 1996, and was remodeled in 2009.  Funding is provided by the City of Linz, the Province of Upper Austria and the Republic of Austria, in addition to private partners. Since 2014, the organization has been headed by artistic director Gerfried Stocker and financial director Diethard Schwarzmair.  Museum exhibits  The top of the AEC is called the Sky Media Loft, which is mainly used as a coffee house or bar of the museum. It can also be rented out for meetings or events. The bar has occasionally been used as the studio for the newscast of the local TV branch of the Austrian national TV organization ORF. The specialty of the Sky Media Loft is the marvelous view over the Nibelungenbr\u00fccke and the main place of Linz at the other side of the Danube which functions as background of the newscasts.  The second floor is where people can interact with exhibits. There are Musicbottles containing different types of music or Pingpongplus which is a table tennis game on a desk with virtual water on its surface.  The first floor has displays about the world that had been hidden from our eyes. In the \"Hidden Worlds\" various machines are translating voice and words into virtual symbols or colors and everyday life articles can be moved on a screen if they are touched.  The little room between the first and the ground floor one of the main attractions is offered. The flight simulator \"Humphrey\" uses virtual reality goggles to give users a simulated view of the flight and the person taking the trip is connected to the computer by cables fixed all over the body. It is possible to fly everywhere and to see the movements of the hands, feet, and the landscape if the visitor raises the head or looks down.  The entrance or the so-called \"Login Gateway\" of the museum is on the ground floor and leads the newcomer directly to the Telegarden, where a robot is looking after a flower patch. Every ticket is provided with a bar code that gives information about the time the visitor entered the museum. After the visit, the ticket can be put into a computer near the exit and it gives statistic information about the things that happened in the world during the span of the stay in the AEC. The list that is printed out gives information about how many people died or were born during that time or how many accidents have been caused by drunken drivers.  The last floor is called Virtual Reality and it can be found in the basement of the building. The CAVE is another attraction of the museum. The cube with 3 meters side length is used as a screen to project the virtual world. There are always groups of about 10 that dive into a world where physical laws do not have any meaning. Additionally, the 3D spectacles give the impression of a bodyful environment.  Museum 2009\u2013present The new Ars Electronica Center, which was designed by Treusch architecture ZT GmbH, opened its doors on 2 January 2009 after roughly two years of construction work and an approximate cost of 30 million euros. It now has 3000 square meters for exhibitions, 100\u00a0m2 for research and development, 400\u00a0m2 for workshops and conferences, 650\u00a0m2 for catering and another 1000\u00a0m2 of public space for various types of events.  The new AEC consists of the original building, a new \"twin-tower\", the main exhibition hall called Main Gallery and the new space for the Ars Electronica Futurelab. The whole building is covered with a 5000-square-meter glass skin that consists of 1100 glass panels. Each panel is equipped with an LED bar that allows it to change its color. Therefore, the whole building acts as a giant display. Artists can create their own visualizations which will be shown on various occasions, especially during the Ars Electronica Festival.  The restaurant is located on the third floor of the new building and is called CUBUS, referring to the building's cubic shape.  Museum exhibits  With the new building came a new thematic orientation inside of Ars Electronica. Life sciences, global developments (e.g. climate change, population growth, environmental pollution) and the exploration of the universe are just a view of various new topics. The museum can be separated into the following areas:  Main Gallery  The Main Gallery with approximately 1000 square meters houses the main exhibition called New Views of Humankind, which focuses on topics like biotechnology, robotics, rapid prototyping and the human body. It is separated into the following four so-called \"labs\":  Brain-Lab focuses on the human brain, perception and advances in medicine. Bio-Lab focuses on biotechnology and its applications. Fab-Lab deals with new possibilities offered by 3D printers and rapid prototyping. Robo-Lab deals with robotica as well as different prothetic systems.  Main Gallery contains a special area for children which is not thematically connected to the main exhibition.  Geo City  Geo City focuses on global developments caused by humankind, like growth in population and the extraction of natural resources. Those global developments are connected with possible local reactions, which is visualized in an interactive city information system called Sim-Linz.  Artists, Creators, Engineers  This is the area for temporary exhibitions on the first and second floor of the original building and focuses on the interdisciplinary aspects of Ars Electronica and its contributors.  Deep Space  The Deep Space is a multifunctional presentation room that offers a wide range of possibilities. It consists of two walls (front and floor) with dimensions of 16\u00a0\u00d7 9 meters which serve as screens for eight Galaxy NH-12 projectors by Barco. The projects range from high-resolution videos to scientific (3D) visualizations like a flight out from the solar system to the whole known universe and artistic projects.  FutureLab  The same building holds the Ars Electronica FutureLab, a place for researching and trying out new cyberarts technologies.  See also the Prix Ars Electronica, a yearly award ceremony given out by Ars Electronica at their cyberarts festival.  Since 2004, one of the awards at the Prix Ars Electronica brings a young innovator or team of innovators to the FutureLab for a summer to develop a budding idea or technology in electronic media.  Festival  The annual Ars Electronica Festival is a gathering of artists, scientists and technologists, intended as \"a setting for experimentation, evaluation and reinvention\". The festival has always exerted a public presence in Linz, mounting large-scale open-air projects and holding  lectures, discussions and workshops in a wide range of public venues.  Each year the festival is devoted to a specific theme. The festival in 2014, had as its theme \"C... What it Takes to Change\", i.e. ways in which social change and innovation can be promoted. It attracted 579 participants and about 85,000 visitors.  Features at the 2014 festival  Device art  A form of concept art, device art has been described as \"a rebellion of form, taking everyday objects and inverting them to tell you something different\". Among the examples exhibited at the 2014 festival were:  \"Otamatone\" \u2013 a musical instrument shaped like a musical note.  \"Food Simulator\", in which a pressure sensor in the user's mouth simulates the sensation of chewing food.  \"Lenticular Bicycle\" - an old fashioned bicycle with a screen carousel mounted above the handlebars, known as \"Sustainable Cinema No. 2\" and created by Scott Hessels.  A robot that performs street begging, made from recycled computer parts, with a voice and robotic hands.  \"Touchy\", a \"human camera\", devised by the Hong Kong-based artist Eric Suiss.  Smart atoms (spaxels) A version called \"Smart atoms: spaxels version\" was developed by Ars Electronica Futurelab and shown at the 2014 festival.  Prix Ars Electronica  The Prix Ars Electronica is an annual award made in several categories, \"honoring creativity and innovativeness in the use of digital media\". Award winners are selected by a five-person international expert jury, who may themselves propose candidates. The prize may be awarded to individuals or to teams or organizations, and may be awarded for a specific work of art or for another form of innovation. Grover (2008) has described the top-ranking award, the Golden Nica, as \"the Oscar of digital art\".  The prize was first awarded in 1987, and there have been several changes in the categories since then. In 2014, there were 2,703 entries from 77 countries. All entries remain on display in an online archive, the Prix Ars Electronica Showcase, containing over 55,000 items.  Award categories Awards of the Golden Nica (worth 10,000 euros), Awards of Distinction, and Honorary Mentions are made in the following categories:  Computer animation / Film / VFX (First presented in 1987)  U19 Create Your World (First presented in 1998)  Visionary Pioneers of Media Art  Interactive Art  Digital Music & Sound Art  Hybrid Art (First presented in 2007)  Digital Communities (First presented in 2004)  Artificial Intelligence & Life Art (First presented in 2019) Note:   There is also a grant scheme to honor and support ideas of exceptional promise.

It acts as Ars Electronica's permanent base and showcase. The majority of the space is used for public exhibitions and events, with an emphasis on interactivity and participation. Major themes are life sciences, environmental issues, and preparation for impending technological developments with likely impacts on society.  There is also provision for conferences, workshops, and R&D. The center was enhanced and expanded in 2009, coincident with Linz's term as European Capital of Culture. It is the most-visited museum in Linz.  Ars Electronica Futurelab The Futurelab, housed at the Ars Electronica Center, is a center of expertise for multidisciplinary research and development of new cyberarts technologies.

Wiktionary  Comment Trent Nathaniel Grover has included an appendix about Ars Electronica in his book Dream of the Techno-Shaman (2008). He describes the institute's activities as \"a unique platform for exploring, discussing, tracking, and analyzing the interrelation between art, technology, and society\". Such work, he argues, affirms the place of the human being at the center of techno-cultural processes, as \"beneficiaries, victims, and, above all, creators and appliers of new technology\". Noting that the rapid pace of technological innovation has profound implications for culture and society, he presents the role of Ars Electronica as working to integrate developments in technology with art and society to the benefit of all, and contrasts this perspective with the Modernist call for \"art for art's sake\".  Grover concludes by hoping that Ars Electronica \"will be able to maintain its ongoing quest for innovation and expansion so that we can all benefit from and further involve ourselves in the integration of art, technology, and society\".  Publications Grover (2008) has described the published work of Ars Electronica as \"a compelling snapshot of codependent technological and artistic development with expansive and lasting social and cultural impact.\"   Cyberarts 98: .net, Interactive Art, Computer Animation/Visual Effects, Computer Music, U19/Cybergeneration.

It was founded in 1979 by Herbert W. Franke, Hannes Leopoldseder, and datakitchen (Birgit Williams and Michael Shaver). The roots of Ars Electronica are in the Cybernetic Art Society, which was formed in Vienna in the mid-1970s by a group of artists and scientists who were interested in utilizing computers and video equipment to realize artistic ideas and visions. In 1979, the first Ars Electronica exhibition took place in the dentistry clinic of the University of Vienna. The exhibition was opened by the then-chancellor of the university, KnoxHEPA air filter, and the president of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Herbert W. Franke. In the following year, 1980, the Ars Electronica Festival was held for the first time. The exhibition and festival have since been an annual event. In 1987 the term \"Ars Electronica\" was coined by the German philosopher and scientist Hans-Peter D\u00fcrr.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Oklahoma State Highway 71\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "State Highway 71 (abbreviated as SH-71 or OK-71) is a state highway in eastern Oklahoma. It runs from State Highway 31 in Quinton north to intersect State Highway 9 near Enterprise. It then continues north to Lake Eufaula Dam, and then turns east to end at State Highway 2. It has no lettered spur routes.  Route description  State Highway 71 begins at SH-31 on the west side of Quinton in northeast Pittsburg County. The highway initially follows the Quinton street grid, which takes it in a north-northwest direction. As the grid peters out on the outskirts of town, SH-71 breaks away to the west and then to the northwest to avoid Beaver Mountain, gradually curving around to a northerly heading as it approaches the county line. The route crosses into Haskell County about three miles north of Quinton.  The road continues north in Haskell County until it veers northeast and crosses Longtown Creek. The road then turns back north, passing through rural parts of the county. SH-71 intersects SH-9 in the unincorporated community of Enterprise, just over five miles (8\u00a0km) north of the Pittsburg\u2013Haskell county line.  North of Enterprise, SH-71 parallels Brooken Creek until it drains into Lake Eufaula. The highway serves the boat docks and campgrounds on the east side of the lake, which is the largest entirely within Oklahoma. SH-71 then runs across the dam impounding the lake, bringing it into McIntosh County.  SH-71 merely cuts across the southeast corner of McIntosh County; the highway spends only  within its boundaries. It soon enters Muskogee County, now on an eastbound trajectory. The road runs through the Canadian River valley, staying between the river and Hi Early Mountain. The route next turns northeast, away from the river but still skirting the mountain's base. It finally comes to an end at SH-2 about  south of Porum.

It is a north\u2013south highway that runs for 95.7 miles (154.4 km) from Interstate 40 (I-40) south of Oklahoma City to U.S. Highway 60 in Prague. It passes through or near several communities, including Oklahoma City, Edmond, Guthrie, and Prague. The route begins at a point on I-40 west of Oklahoma City and south of the I-40/SH-3W interchange. (The SH-71 designation continues south along I-40 to an interchange with US-70.) The route travels north through the city of Edmond, intersecting SH-15. It then passes through the community of Guthrie, where it junctions with SH-33. North of Guthrie, the route crosses US-77 and then passes through the community of Washington. It then proceeds north to an intersection with US-62 in Prague. SH-71 turns east onto US-62, then turns north again one block later, terminating at US-60. The route was first added to the state highway system in 1930 as State Highway 31. In the early 1930s, the route was realigned to run through Guthrie and Washington. In 1941, the Oklahoma State Highway Commission proposed a new U.S. Highway 71 be built from Oklahoma City to the Texas border. The Commission wanted the new route to run west from Oklahoma City to the new US-62, then follow US-62 to the Texas border. The American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) approved the new route in 1946, and US-71 was added to the United States Numbered Highway System in 1949. In 1953, the SH-71 designation was applied to the segment of the old State Highway 31 between Oklahoma City and Prague. SH-71 is a busy highway that serves as a major artery in the Oklahoma City metropolitan area. It provides the main road connection between Edmond and Guthrie, two of the area's larger cities. In the Oklahoma City area, it is the main highway for getting from I-40 to US-77 and US-62, two of the city's major radial highways. SH-71 is a four-lane highway in the Oklahoma City metropolitan area. It is a six-lane highway between I-40 and US-77, with a small eight-lane portion between 60th and 63rd Streets. North of US-77, it is a two-lane highway except for a four-lane portion between Washington and Prague. The route has a speed limit of 65 miles per hour (105 km/h) in the metropolitan area and 55 miles per hour (89 km/h) in rural areas.

Schall\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "James Vincent Schall  (January 20, 1928 \u2013 April 17, 2019) was an American Jesuit Roman Catholic priest, teacher, writer, and philosopher.  He was, most recently, Professor of Political Philosophy in the Department of Government at Georgetown University.  He retired from teaching in December 2012, giving his final lecture on December 7, 2012, at Georgetown;  it was entitled \"The Final Gladness,\" and was sponsored by the Tocqueville Forum. Of his many publications his book Another Sort of Learning (\"a reflection on different aspects of lifelong learning\") has been hailed as exceptional.  Biography Born in Pocahontas, Iowa, and educated in local public schools, he graduated from Knoxville (Iowa) High School in 1945.  After time in the U.S. Army (1946\u201347), he joined the Society of Jesus (California Province) in 1948, and then attended Santa Clara University in California.  He earned an MA in Philosophy from Gonzaga University in 1955. He earned a PhD in Political Theory from Georgetown University in 1960, and was ordained as a Roman Catholic priest in 1963.  In 1964, he earned an M.A. in Sacred Theology from Santa Clara University.  Fr. Schall was a member of the faculty of the Institute of Social Sciences, Pontifical Gregorian University, Rome, from 1964 to 1977, and a member of the Government Department, University of San Francisco, from 1968 to 1977. Among the sources for Schall's lectures were Christian Scripture, Aristotle, Plato, Cicero, Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, G.K. Chesterton, and Pope Benedict XVI.  Before retiring, he had been a member of the Government Department at Georgetown University since 1977.  In 1993, 2004 and 2010, Fr. Schall was presented the Edward B. Bunn, SJ, Award for Faculty Excellence by the senior class in the College of Arts and Sciences at Georgetown University.  Schall retired from his position at Georgetown in December 2012 and moved into the Jesuit retirement home in Los Gatos, California  (on the same property as the location of his old novitiate) where he continued to write books and articles for publications and websites. He also continued to give presentations to small groups on request.  Schall served as a member of the Pontifical Commission on Justice and Peace, in Rome from 1977 to 1982. He was also a member of the National Council of the Humanities, and a member of the National Endowment for the Humanities from 1984 to 1990.

Fr. Schall was an expert on the thought of G. K. Chesterton; he edited two volumes of Chesterton's collected works and wrote his own volume of essays on the famous Catholic convert.  Schall was a vigorous supporter of Benedict XVI's critique of western culture which categorizes it as a \"dictatorship of relativism\".  Schall taught that Catholicism is where \"Revelation is addressed to reason\" and stated that \"We are living in a time where the logic of disorder is at work, rejecting systematically the logic of being a human being.\" Schall stated that the societal re-examination of the definition of the family \"is not just an accident,\" but is the culture \"rejecting heavenly answers and replacing them with human answers. A will is leading you, and it says there is something wrong with being human. That goes back to the whole drama of the Fall. C.S. Lewis says the ultimate sin, the ultimate disorder, is to say what is good is bad, what is bad is good.\"  A reporter summed up his statements as \"If we [in society] reject the intelligibility and goodness of creation, will we still be able to hear God\u2019s voice calling us to our supernatural end?\"  Medical issues Schall survived a few major illnesses, including one that resulted in the loss of function in one of his eyes. In the summer of 2010 he had a cancerous jawbone and its attached teeth removed and replaced with bone taken from his leg.

Cronenberg is home to the Wuppertal-Cronenberg station, one of the main railway stations of Wuppertal. The Wuppertal-Ronsdorf station is also located nearby. Cronenberg is the site of the Ford Motor Company's Wuppertal engine plant, which opened in 1925. In 2006, the plant had approximately 1,500 employees and produced 200,000 engines. The plant was the subject of a major scandal in the early 1990s, when it was discovered that many of its workers had developed serious health problems due to exposure to carcinogenic substances. The headquarters of the West German branch of the Christian Democratic Union, the Christian Democratic Union of Germany, is located in Cronenberg. Cronenberg is the location of the Wuppertal-Cronenberg cemetery, one of the largest in Wuppertal.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2634372}

The team was coached by Gordon Croskery in his 4th season.  Season The potential that Clarkson had shown in the second half of last season was fully realized this year. With all of their principle players returning and several more being welcomed in, the Golden Knights got off to a hot start against Cornell. \"String\" Macartney opened the scoring while new entry Harrison Heintzman netted the game-winner at the end of the second period. The team was short-handed when they met Hamilton a week later, missing both Dion and Heintzman, but gave the Continentals a fight. The teams battled to a 2\u20132 draw after 60 minutes but Tech fell in the extra session.  The team was back at full strength for the following match, a continuation of their brand-new rivalry with St. Lawrence, and Clarkson really let the Larries have it. The Knights beat the Saints 10\u20131 with captain Wayland scoring a hat-trick from the blueline. The team then headed to Brooklyn to face NYU in their opponent's first game in 14 years. The Violets' goaltender, Vye, put up a tremendous effort, limiting Clarkson to just 3 goals in the game. The NYU offense, however, could only muster 3 shots on Klube for the entire match and Tech easily shut out the Violets. On their way home, Clarkson stopped in West Point and received a hard test from Army. The Knights got out to an early lead but the Cadets tied the game at 3-all in the second. After exchanging goals in the third, Clarkson played its second overtime game of the season. Northup netted the go-ahead goal 2 minutes into the frame and then the entire team played defense for the remainder of the 10-minute session to secure their fourth win on the year.  Coach Croskery had more than a week to work with the team before their next match and he had them in fine form when they hosted Syracuse. The Orange had won both of the previous games between the two, but Clarkson wouldn't let that trend continue; Tech swamped Syracuse in front of about 800 fans at home to the tune of 8\u20130. Wayland ended up with his second hat-trick on the year but Heintzman finished one goal better. Their third and final home game of the year occurred over that weekend when Vermont arrived in town. The game was slowed by poor ice conditions but Tech was still able to pump 5 goals into the cage, easily carrying the match.  Clarkson rounded out its season with two rematch games over the next couple of weeks. The first was at Syracuse, where the teams were limited to three 15-minute periods, but Tech continued their winning streak with a solid 4\u20131 victory. The second was against St. Lawrence and the Knights faced a far tougher task than they had the first time around. The Saints' defense had vastly improved over the course of the season and they held Clarkson off of the scoresheet for the first half of the match. Fortunately for Clarkson, their defense was just as impenetrable. The stronger legs of the Knights showed as the game went on and eventually they broke through. \"Chesty\" Northup broke the tie in the second and then added another in the third, allowing Clarkson to earn its seventh-consecutive win and third shutout on the year.  With much of the team returning for next season, there were now high expectations for the Knights.

The team was coached by Jack Foster and played its home games at the Clarkson Ice Hockey Rink. The Golden Knights finished with a 19\u20133\u20131 record, the second straight season in which the team had a record of 19 wins and 3 losses or better. The team won the Tri-State League, making it the first time the team had won the league in three seasons. The team also won the NCAA Championship for the second time in three years, the first time the team had won back-to-back national championships. The team was led by senior center Paul Laylin, who finished with a team-high 21 goals and a plus-minus of +23. Laylin was named the team's most valuable player for the second straight season. Junior goalie Charles Kerr, who had been a member of the team since the program's inaugural 1926 season, had a goals-against average of 1.05 and a save percentage of .928, the best in the nation. The team's defense, led by senior captain Russ Laylin and junior Herb Hannah, allowed only 33 goals in 22 games, for a goals-against average of 1.52, the best in the nation. The Golden Knights opened the season with a 5\u20130 win over Hamilton College on December 17, 1926.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Scott Perry (politician)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Scott Gordon Perry (born May 27, 1962) is an American politician. He is the U.S. representative for . It was numbered the 4th district from 2013 to 2019. It includes Harrisburg, York and most of the inner suburbs.  A member of the Republican Party, Perry represented the 92nd district in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives from 2007 to 2013. He is a retired Pennsylvania Army National Guard brigadier general. In November 2021, Perry was elected chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, the most conservative group among U.S. House Republicans.  On December 20, 2021, the House panel investigating the January 6 Capitol attack called for an interview with Perry \u2013 the first time it publicly sought to question a sitting member of Congress. Perry emphatically declined the request the next day. The panel's chairperson said it had evidence from several witnesses that Perry had \"an important role\" in efforts to install Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark as acting attorney general.  Early life and education Perry was born in San Diego, California. His family moved to Dillsburg, Pennsylvania, a suburb of York, when he was seven. In 1980, he graduated from Northern High School in Dillsburg and Cumberland-Perry Vo-Tech School in York County, Pennsylvania. In 1991, Perry obtained a B.S. in business administration and management from Pennsylvania State University. In July 2012, he received a master's degree in strategic planning from the United States Army War College.  Military service  Army National Guard Perry began his military career in 1980 when he enlisted in the Pennsylvania Army National Guard. He attended basic training at Fort Dix, New Jersey, and graduated from Advanced Individual Training at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, as a technical drafting specialist. He graduated from Pennsylvania's Officer Candidate School and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Field Artillery.  After receiving his commission, Perry qualified as a helicopter pilot in the Aviation branch. He served in a variety of staff and command assignments as he advanced through the ranks, including executive officer of 1st Squadron, 104th Cavalry Regiment during deployment to Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2002\u20133, and commander of 2nd Battalion (General Support), 104th Aviation Regiment beginning in 2008.  Iraq war In 2009\u201310, Perry commanded 2nd Battalion, 104th Aviation Regiment during its pre-deployment training and service in Iraq for Operation Iraqi Freedom. As Task Force Diablo, 2-104th Aviation was credited with flying 1,400 missions, accruing over 13,000 combat flight hours, and transporting over 3 million pounds of cargo and 43,000 soldiers and civilians. Perry was credited with flying 44 missions and accrued nearly 200 combat flight hours.  Post-Iraq  After returning from Iraq, Perry was promoted to colonel and assigned to command the Pennsylvania National Guard's 166th Regiment (Regional Training Institute) (2010\u201312). From 2012 to 2014, he commanded the garrison at the Fort Indiantown Gap National Training Center. In May 2014, Perry was assigned as one of the assistant division commanders of the 28th Infantry Division, and he was promoted to brigadier general in November 2015. In May 2016, he was assigned as assistant adjutant general for Army at the Pennsylvania National Guard's Joint Force Headquarters. Perry retired from the Pennsylvania National Guard on March 1, 2019.  Business career In 1993, Perry founded Hydrotech Mechanical Services, Inc., a mechanical contracting firm in Dillsburg. The firm provides contract construction and maintenance services to municipal and investor-owned utilities from North Carolina to New York, specializing in large meter calibration. In 2002, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection accused the company of altering sewage monitoring reports while doing work for the Memphord Estates Sewage Treatment Company. Perry faced criminal charges of conspiring to falsify state-mandated sewage records. In the aftermath of the investigation and review, he was allowed to complete a diversion program and avoid any criminal charges, which allowed him to maintain his U.S security clearance.  Pennsylvania House of Representatives  Elections In 2006, state representative Bruce Smith of Pennsylvania's 92nd House district decided to retire. Perry won the Republican primary with 41% of the vote. He won the general election with 71% of the vote, and took office on January 2, 2007. In 2008, Perry was reelected to a second term unopposed. In 2010, he was reelected to a third term unopposed.  Committee assignments  U.S. House of Representatives  Elections  2012  In 2012, Perry gave up his state house seat to run for the 4th congressional district. The district had previously been the 19th district, represented by six-term incumbent Republican Todd Platts, who was giving up the seat to honor a self-imposed term limit. In 2010, when Platts wanted to become U.S. Comptroller General, he spoke to Perry about running for the seat.  Perry won a seven-way primary with over 50% of the vote. Although outspent nearly 2 to 1 in the campaign, he beat his closest competitor with nearly three times as many votes. Political newcomer Harry Perkinson, an engineer, advanced in a two-way Democratic primary. Perry won the general election, 60%\u201334%.  2014  In 2014, Perry was unopposed in the Republican primary and the former Harrisburg mayor, Linda D. Thompson, was unopposed in the Democratic primary. Perry won the general election, 75%\u201325%.  2016  Perry won the 2016 election with no primary challenge and no official Democratic opponent. Joshua Burkholder of Harrisburg, a political novice, withdrew from the Democratic primary after too many signatures on his qualifying petition were successfully challenged. His subsequent write-in candidacy won the Democratic primary, but he was unaffiliated in the general election. Perry defeated Burkholder, 66%\u201334%.  2018  After ruling the state's congressional map an unconstitutional gerrymander, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court issued a new map for the 2018 elections. Perry's district was renumbered the 10th and made significantly more compact than its predecessor. It lost most of the more rural and Republican areas of York County to the neighboring 11th district (the old 16th). To make up for the loss in population, it was pushed slightly to the north, absorbing the remainder of Democratic-leaning Dauphin County that had not been in the old 4th. On paper, the new district was less Republican than its predecessor. Had the district existed in 2016, Donald Trump would have won it with 52% of the vote to Hillary Clinton's 43%; Trump carried the old 4th with 58% of the vote.  Pastor and Army veteran George Scott won the Democratic primary by a narrow margin and opposed Perry in the general election for the reconfigured 10th. The two debated in October before Perry won with 51.3% of the vote to Scott's 48.7%, with the new district boundaries taking effect in 2019. Perry held on by winning the district's share of his home county, York County, by 11,600 votes. This was the district's closest race since 1974, when Bill Goodling won his first term in what was then the 19th with 51% of the vote.  2020  In 2020, Perry had no Republican primary challenge, and the Pennsylvania auditor general, Eugene DePasquale, won a two-way Democratic primary. Perry was reelected with 53% of the vote in the general election.  Tenure Perry is a member of the Freedom Caucus. In November 2021, he was elected to chair the group, succeeding Andy Biggs in January 2022.  In October 2017, in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, Perry accused CNN anchor Chris Cuomo of exaggerating the crisis in Puerto Rico.  In January 2018, Perry suggested that ISIS might have been involved in the 2017 Las Vegas shooting. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack, but authorities have maintained that gunman Stephen Paddock acted alone.  In December 2019, Perry was one of 195 Republicans to vote against both articles of impeachment against President Trump.  In October 2020, Perry was one of 17 Republicans to vote against a House resolution to formally condemn the QAnon conspiracy theory. He said he voted against the resolution because he was concerned about infringements on free speech, saying, \"it's very dangerous for the government ... to determine what is okay to like and what is not okay to like.\"  In March 2021, Perry voted against the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. He said only 9% of the act's spending was allotted to defeat the COVID-19 virus, while the rest would advance Democratic policies.  In April 2021, at a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee meeting on immigration, Perry said, \"For many Americans, what seems to be happening or what they believe right now is happening is, what appears to them is we're replacing national-born American\u2014native-born Americans to permanently transform the political landscape of this very nation.\"  In June 2021, Perry was one of 21 House Republicans to vote against a resolution to give the Congressional Gold Medal to police officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on January 6. He cosponsored a bill, introduced the same day, that would give the same medal to police officers without mentioning the attack.  At the June 2021 Republican Pennsylvania Leadership Conference, Perry said Democrats \"are not the loyal opposition. They are the opposition to everything you love and believe in\" and \"want to destroy the country you grew up in\", invoking comparisons to Nazis.  Foreign policy In 2020, Perry voted against the National Defense Authorization Act of 2021, which in part would prevent the president from withdrawing soldiers from Afghanistan without congressional approval.  In March 2021, Perry was one of 14 House Republicans to vote against a measure condemning the Myanmar coup d'\u00e9tat that overwhelmingly passed.  In July 2021, Perry voted against the bipartisan ALLIES Act, which would increase by 8,000 the number of special immigrant visas for Afghan allies of the U.S. military during its invasion of Afghanistan while also reducing some application requirements that caused long application backlogs; the bill passed in the House 407\u201316.  Immigration Perry voted against the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020 which authorized DHS to nearly double the available H-2B visas for the remainder of FY 2020.  Perry voted against the Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1158) which effectively prohibits ICE from cooperating with Health and Human Services to detain or remove illegal alien sponsors of unaccompanied alien children (UACs).  Involvement with 2020 presidential election After the 2020 general election, Perry promoted false claims of election fraud.  In December 2020, Perry was one of 126 Republican House members to sign an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated Trump.  On January 6, 2021, Perry joined Missouri senator Josh Hawley in objecting to counting Pennsylvania's electoral votes in the 2020 presidential election. During the storming of the U.S. Capitol that day, Perry and his congressional colleagues were ushered to a secure location.  Perry reportedly played a role in a December 2020 crisis at the Justice Department in which Trump considered firing acting attorney general Jeffrey Rosen and replacing him with Jeffrey Clark, the acting chief of the civil division of the DOJ. The New York Times reported Perry introduced Clark to Trump because Clark's \"openness to conspiracy theories about election fraud presented Mr. Trump with a welcome change from the acting attorney general, Jeffrey A. Rosen, who stood by the results of the election and had repeatedly resisted the president's efforts to undo them.\" Before the certification of the electoral college vote on January 6, Perry and Clark reportedly discussed a plan in which the Justice Department would send Georgia legislators a letter threatening an investigation into voter fraud and an invalidation of Georgia's electoral votes, even though the DOJ had investigated reports of fraud but found nothing significant, as attorney general Bill Barr had publicly announced weeks earlier. Clark drafted a letter to Georgia officials and presented it to Rosen and his deputy Richard Donoghue. It claimed the DOJ had \"identified significant concerns that may have impacted the outcome of the election in multiple States\" and urged the Georgia legislature to convene a special session for the \"purpose of considering issues pertaining to the appointment of Presidential Electors.\" Rosen and Donoghue rejected the proposal. In August 2021, CNN reported that Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe had briefed top Justice Department officials that no evidence had been found of any foreign powers' interference with voting machines. Clark was reportedly concerned that intelligence community analysts were withholding information and believed Perry and others knew more about possible foreign interference. Clark requested authorization from Rosen and Donoghue for another briefing from Ratcliffe, asserting hackers had found that \"a Dominion machine accessed the Internet through a smart thermostat with a net connection trail leading back to China.\"  On December 20, 2021, House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack chairman Bennie Thompson wrote to Perry asking him to provide information about his involvement in the effort to install Clark as acting attorney general. Thompson believed Perry had been involved in the effort to install Clark, given previous testimony from former acting attorney general Rosen and his deputy Donoghue, as well as communications between Perry and Meadows. Perry declined the request the next day, asserting the committee was illegitimate. Among several text messages to Meadows the committee released on December 14 was one attributed to a \"member of Congress\" dated January 5 that read \"Please check your signal,\" a reference to the encrypted messaging system Signal. In his letter to Perry, Thompson mentioned evidence that Perry had communicated with Meadows using Signal, though Perry denied sending that particular text message.

Ukrayinskiy Tantsyuvalniy Ansambl \"Cheremosh\") is a Ukrainian dance company based in Edmonton, Alberta and a leader of Ukrainian dance in Canada. It was founded in 1969 by Chester and Luba Kuc and named after the Cheremosh River that separates the historic regions of Bukovyna and Galicia in Ukraine. Since 1991 Cheremosh has been under the direction of Artistic Director and Ballet Master Mykola Kanevets. Cheremosh has toured throughout Canada, the United States, Scotland, China, and most recently, a 15-day tour across four Australian cities.  History  The Cheremosh Ukrainian Dance Company of Edmonton, Alberta, was founded in 1969 by Chester and Luba Kuc. The group began with just 19 dancers, and since then has grown to include four performing groups, a School of Dance and over 100 dancers at the various levels. Named after the Cheremosh River that separates the regions of Bukovyna and Halychyna in Ukraine, the company easily matches the river's boisterousness and vivacity.  As Cheremosh's first Artistic Director, Chester Kuc's goal was to modernize Ukrainian folk dance by attempting to convey certain truths about the Ukrainian people. Using dance to make these truths dramatic and effective, he brought his dances to the stage in order to entertain audiences and further the growth of the rich Ukrainian culture in Canada.  Since its inception, Cheremosh has had five artistic directors. Following Chester Kuc, Richard Wacko, Ken Kachmar and Greg Bayda, respectively, led Cheremosh between the years of 1982 and 1991.  Currently, all performing groups train under Artistic Director and Ballet Master Mykola Kanevets, whose distinctive choreography and meticulous instruction have helped the Cheremosh Ukrainian Dance Company and its affiliates maintain a strong reputation as a successful and accomplished Ukrainian dance organization.

He was a Professor of Germanic Philology at the University of Berlin and a renowned authority on early Germanic literature.  Life  Andreas Heusler was born into a prestigious family in Basel, the third in a line of fathers and sons bearing the same name (his father was Andreas Heusler (1834\u20131921) and his grandfather Andreas Heusler (1802\u20131868); both worked in law and government). Andreas enjoyed a stellar career as a student in Basel, Freiburg im Breisgau, and Berlin, completing his studies in 1887 in Freiburg with the doctoral thesis \"Beitrag zum Consonantismus der Mundart von Baselstadt\".  In 1890, when Heusler was 25 years old, he began lecturing in Berlin and was a professor of Nordic textual studies there from 1894 to 1913. He focused on research into Old Norse literature, especially the Poetic Edda and \u00cdslendingas\u00f6gur, translating many works into German and travelling twice to Iceland. From 1914 to 1919, Heusler was professor of Germanic textual studies at Berlin University. He moved back to Switzerland in 1920 and lived in Arlesheim near Basel, where a place was made for him at Basel University, where he worked until he reached the age limit in 1936.    Besides ancient Germanic and Nordic culture, Heusler was noted for his love of music (he played the violin); around 1889 he switched from a strongly held Christianity to being a confirmed atheist. There is some debate as to where Heusler stood on German nationalism in the 1930s. He seems at first to have been swayed by it, but it is thought that he turned his back on Adolf Hitler around 1938. A good insight into his thoughts is offered by the four hundred letters to Wilhelm Ranisch which he wrote in the period 1890\u20131940.  In 1893, Heusler married the singer Auguste Hohenschild, who was fourteen years his senior. The marriage was unhappy and they divorced in 1922, having been separated since 1901. Heusler died in Basel in 1940 after a short illness.  Influence  Andreas Heusler was among the most influential figures in early Germanic studies in the first half of the twentieth century, and much of his work still resonates today.

The given name of Wigglesworth might seem unusual today, but in the 18th century a well-known family of educators in New England had descended from Michael Wigglesworth (1631\u20131705). An older brother Samuel Dole (1778\u2013?) married Katherine Wigglesworth (1780\u2013?) who was Michael Wigglesworth's great-granddaughter.  Their grandson was painter Enoch Wood Perry, Jr. (1831\u20131915).   Another older brother Ebenezer Dole (1776\u20131847) became an early anti-slavery activist in Hallowell, Maine.  Dole  married Elizabeth Haskell on March 11, 1807.  She was born August 30, 1788 in Deer Isle, Maine and died in 1877. They had four children, and lived in an area called Bloomfield, later called Skowhegan, Maine. Dole worked as a cabinet maker and kept a small farm, while serving as Deacon of a Congregational Church. He died on June 16, 1845  in Canaan, Maine (also called Bloomfield at the time) .  First-born son Daniel Dole (1808\u20131878) became a missionary to the Hawaiian Islands, and founding principal of Punahou School. Daniel's son Sanford Ballard Dole became the first Governor of the Territory of Hawaii.  Second son Nathan Dole (1811\u20131855) had sons Charles Fletcher Dole (1845\u20131927) and Nathan Haskell Dole (1852\u20131935). Great-grandson James Drummond Dole (1877\u20131958) founded what became the Dole Food Company.  Not much is known about daughter Elizabeth Dole (1815\u20131863).  Third son Isaiah Dole, born May 23, 1819, was a classical-language teacher, married Elizabeth Todd Pearson August 18, 1844, and died May 17, 1892.  Isaiah and Elizabeth had a son Edmund Pearson Dole (1850\u20131928), who was the Attorney General of Hawaii, and daughter who married William J. Sewall.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"John Isner\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "John Robert Isner (born April 26, 1985) is an American professional tennis player. He has been ranked as high as No. 8 in men's singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP).  Considered one of the best servers ever to play on the ATP Tour, Isner achieved his career-high singles ranking in July 2018 by virtue of his maiden Masters 1000 crown at the 2018 Miami Open and a semifinals appearance at the 2018 Wimbledon Championships. He has also twice reached the quarterfinals at the US Open in 2011 and 2018, the latter of which helped qualify him for his first ATP Finals appearance later that year. He currently has the second-most aces in the history of the ATP Tour, having served over 13,000 aces. At the 2010 Wimbledon Championships, he played the longest professional tennis match in history, defeating Nicolas Mahut in a total of 11 hours and 5 minutes, played over the course of three days. Isner currently holds the record for hitting the ATP's fastest \"official\" serve ever and third-fastest on record in tennis at  during his first-round 2016 Davis Cup match. On 17 August 2021 at the 2021 Western & Southern Open, he became the second player in the world to reach 13,000 aces on the most aces in career list, joining Ivo Karlovic.  Professional career  2007\u20132008: Turning pro, First ATP final, top 100  Isner began his professional career in earnest in the summer of 2007. With a world ranking of no. 839, he needed a wildcard entry into the main draws of every single tournament, even at Futures level.  He won his first tournament of the summer, the USA F14 Futures, beating the top three seeds along the way. Then, after first-round losses at Challenger level as well as a tournament at ATP level, he beat five top-300 players and three seeds to win the Lexington Challenger in July and improve his ranking to no. 416 after just one month.  At the following week's tournament at the Legg Mason Tennis Classic in Washington, D.C., a late withdrawal freed up a wildcard spot, which was given to Isner at the last minute. Isner took full advantage of his good fortune, recording his first wins over top-100 players. He won third-set tiebreakers on five consecutive days, beating no. 73 Tim Henman, no. 47 Benjamin Becker, no. 189 qualifier Wayne Odesnik, no. 12 Tommy Haas, and no. 54 Ga\u00ebl Monfils, to reach the final, where he fell to fellow American Andy Roddick. His week raised his ranking to no. 193 in the world after six weeks on the pro tour.  Isner's success in Washington, D.C. earned him wildcard entries into three more ATP tournaments\u2014the Masters 1000 Series event in Cincinnati a week later, New Haven and the US Open. He lost in the first round in Cincinnati to quarterfinalist no. 15 David Ferrer. The following week in New Haven, he beat no. 49 Becker a second time, before falling to Ferrer for the second week in a row.  In his US Open d\u00e9but, he defeated the 26th-seeded player, former quarterfinalist Jarkko Nieminen, firing 34 aces along the way. He proceeded to win his second-round match against Rik de Voest, before losing in the third round to top seed and eventual champion Roger Federer. Isner was one of only two players to take a set from Federer in the championship. His US Open performance improved his ranking to no. 144.  After the US Open, Isner continued to play exclusively in North America and finished the year ranked no. 107. That year, Isner was added to the United States Davis Cup team as a practice partner.  Isner's no. 106 ranking in November 2007 was just good enough to get him direct entry into his first Australian Open after several players ranked above him dropped out. He was defeated in the first round of the 2008 Australian Open by veteran Fabrice Santoro of France. Teamed with Croat Ivo Karlovi\u0107, who stands half an inch taller (Karlovi\u0107 is currently the joint tallest player on the ATP World Tour alongside Reilly Opelka), Isner also lost in the first round of doubles.  Isner broke into the top 100 at no. 93 in February with a quarterfinal appearance at an ATP event in San Jose, beating no. 90 Florent Serra and no. 26 Tommy Haas. He maintained a top-100 ranking in the first three months of the year, beating six players in the top 100, while playing exclusively in events at ATP level. Isner played at his first French Open and Wimbledon, losing in the first round of each. He also played at the US Open, where he lost in the first round. He ended the year ranked no. 144 in the world.  2009: Top 40, first top-10 wins Isner qualified for the singles draw of the 2009 Heineken Open in Auckland, after winning three consecutive three-set matches in qualifying. His final match saw him bounce back from a 0\u20133 deficit in the third set to eventually beat Brazilian Thomaz Bellucci in a tiebreaker. In the main draw, Isner beat Albert Monta\u00f1\u00e9s and countryman Robby Ginepri, before ultimately exiting with a loss in the quarterfinals.  Isner received a wildcard into the 2009 Australian Open, after winning the United States Tennis Association's wildcard tournament, beating Donald Young and Jesse Levine along the way. Despite serving 39 aces against his first-round opponent, Slovakia's Dominik Hrbat\u00fd, he lost in four sets. Isner began working with a new coach, Craig Boynton, who had coached former world no. 1 Jim Courier in the 1990s, in March 2009.  At the 2009 Indian Wells Masters, Isner pulled off a major upset by defeating ninth seed Ga\u00ebl Monfils. This was Isner's first win over a top-10 player, after four previous defeats. He then went on to defeat former world no. 1 Marat Safin, before losing to world no. 6 Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro in the fourth round.  In April 2009 at the U.S. Men's Clay Court Championships in Houston, Texas, at River Oaks Country Club, Isner made it as far as the quarterfinals, where he was defeated by fellow American Wayne Odesnik. Isner qualified for the French Open, but had to withdraw after being diagnosed with mononucleosis, which caused him to miss Wimbledon as well.  In August 2009, he defeated world no. 7 Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and world no. 18 Tom\u00e1\u0161 Berdych en route to the semifinals of the ATP World Tour 500 event in Washington, before losing to world no. 5 Andy Roddick. This performance brought him to a career-high ranking of no. 55 and a special exemption into the Masters 1000 Series event in Montreal, where he defeated Jesse Levine, before losing to Mikhail Youzhny. He earned a wildcard into the Masters 1000 Series event in Cincinnati, where he defeated world no. 21 Tommy Haas, before losing to world no. 35 J\u00e9r\u00e9my Chardy in the second round.  Unseeded and ranked no. 55 in the world entering the US Open, Isner defeated world no. 29 Victor H\u0103nescu in the first round, which was his first win in a Grand Slam tournament since the 2007 US Open, ending a streak of six consecutive defeats. He then advanced to the third round, where he defeated world no. 5 and fellow American Andy Roddick in five sets for his first victory over Roddick, his first victory in a five-set match, and the first time he advanced past the third round of a Grand Slam tournament. He was then defeated in the fourth round by world no. 10 Fernando Verdasco in four sets. His US Open performance brought his ranking to a career-high no. 39.  After playing in Vienna, Basel and at the Paris Masters, Isner finished the year at a career-high no. 34 in the world. He has credited his work with Boynton for helping him get back on track following his disappointing 2008 season.  His progress was acknowledged by his peers, as he was voted the ATP Most Improved Player for 2009, becoming the tenth American to win the award, and the first since Andre Agassi in 1998.  2010: First title, longest match in history  Isner began the year at the 2010 Heineken Open in Auckland. Unseeded, he reached his second career ATP final and first since Washington in 2007. In the final, he saved a championship point to defeat 2001 Australian Open finalist Arnaud Cl\u00e9ment. The victory in Auckland was Isner's first ATP tour title; after the victory he donated $5,000 of his winnings to aid rescue action for the 2010 Haiti earthquake.  The victory catapulted Isner into the top 30 for the first time and also allowed him to surpass Sam Querrey to become the second-highest-ranked American for the first time, behind only Andy Roddick. Isner said he intended to finish the year in the top 20, and given his ascendency in the world rankings combined with the absence of Roddick and James Blake for the 2010 Davis Cup season, it became increasingly likely that Isner would qualify to play singles for the United States Davis Cup team for the first time in his career.  After Gilles Simon withdrew, Isner became the final seed for the 2010 Australian Open. In the first round, he defeated world no. 49 Andreas Seppi for his first victory at the Australian Open and his first victory at a Grand Slam other than the US Open. He then advanced to the round of 16, before losing to world no. 4 and eventual finalist Andy Murray.  After the Australian Open, Davis Cup captain Patrick McEnroe announced that Isner and Querrey would be first and second singles selections on the United States Davis Cup team's first-round World Group tie in Serbia on indoor clay in March 2010; Isner described the selection as \"a dream come true\".  Isner next entered the 2010 Regions Morgan Keegan Championships in Memphis. Seeded sixth, he made it to the finals, before losing to Sam Querrey. In the doubles event, Isner teamed up with Querrey to win the tournament, defeating the British-Australian pair of Ross Hutchins and Jordan Kerr.

His next tournament was the 2010 Serbian Open, where he was the second seed behind defending champion, tournament host and world no. 2 Djokovic. Isner advanced to the first clay-court final of his career, third final of the year, and fourth final of his career. In the final, he lost to Querrey, despite having a match point; this was the second consecutive final Isner lost to Querrey after serving for the championship. However, Isner's finals performance improved his ranking to a career-high no. 19.  Isner's next tournament was his debut appearance at the Mutua Madrile\u00f1a Madrid Open.

Despite being ranked no. 19 in the world entering Wimbledon, Isner was seeded 24th by the tournament committee due to his lack of experience on grass, but was moved up to 23rd following the withdrawal of Radek \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nek.

At the 2010 US Open, Isner was 18th seed and defeated Frederico Gil in the first round.

The first was the now-legendary opening-round match at the 2010 Wimbledon Championships when Isner defeated Nicolas Mahut in 11 hours and 5 minutes in a match played over three separate days. The second-longest match in major tournament history was Isner's loss to South African Kevin Anderson in the first men's semifinal at the 2018 Wimbledon Championships.  The longest match in history: Isner v Mahut, June 22\u201324, 2010  At the 2010 Wimbledon Championships, Isner faced qualifier Nicolas Mahut in the first round. Isner won the match 6\u20134, 3\u20136, 6\u20137, 7\u20136, 70\u201368.  The final set alone was longer than the previous longest match.  In the match, Isner set the record for the most aces served in a match, breaking Ivo Karlovi\u0107's record of 78; Mahut passed the old mark as well. Isner set a new record of 113 aces, ahead of the 103 aces served by Mahut.  The first four sets were played on June 22. At 21:13 BST on June 23 the match was suspended due to darkness for a second day at 59\u201359 in the fifth set. The match resumed on June 24, at 15:30 BST, starting the third day of the match. Overall, the match lasted eleven hours and five minutes. Isner also set the record for the most games won in a Wimbledon match with 92.  The match brought Isner a measure of fame, particularly in the United Kingdom and his native United States. He had guest appearances on Good Morning America and the Late Show with David Letterman, and threw the ceremonial first pitch at a New York Yankees game in Yankee Stadium. He and Mahut won the 2010 ESPY Award for Best Record-Breaking Performance in sport.  The second-longest match: Isner v Anderson, July 13, 2018  This match saw Isner face similarly big-serving Kevin Anderson of South Africa. The match is the longest tennis match ever in the second week of a Grand Slam tournament, both by time and number of games played. It is also the longest-ever match on Centre Court, and the fourth-longest tennis match of all time.  The first three sets were all decided by tiebreakers, the first going to Anderson and both the second and third going to Isner. In the fourth set Anderson exploited an opening and broke Isner's serve to make the score 7\u20136, 6\u20137, 6\u20137, 6\u20134 going into a fifth set in which Anderson seemed to have gained significant momentum from his service break. The fifth quickly became a battle of services as both players began to tire. At 16\u201317 it began to rain, leading to speculation of a delay to close the Centre Court roof, but the rain stopped during the crossover break. Isner endured a shaky mistake which permitted Anderson to get back in the game to 40\u201330 from 40\u20130 down, but Isner forced Anderson to miss the next backhand return and held serve. At 24\u201324, Anderson built up a 0\u201340 lead and while Isner got back two of those points to bring the score to 30\u201340, Anderson broke Isner on his third break point of the game, and served out to win the match in 6 hours and 36 minutes, with the scoreline reading 7\u20136, 6\u20137, 6\u20137, 6\u20134, 26\u201324.  Playing style and equipment Isner has an extremely powerful and consistent serve, thanks in part to his 6-foot-10\u00bd-inch height which makes him the third-tallest player on tour behind Ivo Karlovi\u0107 and Reilly Opelka. Commentators have also praised his composure; in five consecutive third-set tiebreaker wins in Washington, D.C., he delivered huge serves when it mattered most. Isner also has a very powerful forehand, which he uses in tandem with his serve. Isner will often go for one-two points: a big serve followed up by a big forehand. He is also known to back up his serves with approaches to the net, though he does not strictly serve-and-volley. Isner's movement around the court is hampered by his body and he is hurt by players that move him around the court. Isner's fitness has improved considerably throughout the years, as he displayed during his win in the longest tennis match ever at Wimbledon against Nicolas Mahut.  Because of his style of play, that consists of a big, consistent serve, he often ends up winning a great majority of his service games. But at the same time, due to poor movement around the court, he often finds it difficult to break the opponent's serve, especially those players that move him around the court. This often finds him involved in long matches where each player continues holding serve until the set reaches the tiebreak. At Grand Slams where there are no fifth-set tiebreaks (since 2019 only Roland Garros, but before also Wimbledon and the Australian Open), his matches can extend very long, as evidenced by the fact that he was a player in the two longest-ever Grand Slam matches, both at Wimbledon in 2010 and 2018, respectively.  As of January 2012, Isner was sponsored by Lacoste and Prince for his attire and rackets, respectively. His attire carried through most of 2015. He switched his attire to FILA in 2016 at the Australian Open.  Coaches Isner's first coach was Craig Boynton, who worked with him from 2009 to 2012 and helped develop his style of play. Isner and Boynton split over reportedly mutual agreement. Isner then hired Mike Sell, who helped him to significant success, such as defeating Roger Federer, David Nalbandian and Novak Djokovic. During his time with Sell, Isner's ranking stayed around no. 10 in the world. After parting from Sell in 2014, Isner teamed with Justin Gimelstob and worked with him until April 2016. With Gimelstob, Isner's ranking stayed around 10, until 2016, where he dropped to 17. As of 2018, he is currently working with coaches Rene Moller and David Macpherson.  Personal life Isner is the youngest of three boys. He started playing tennis seriously at age 11. He is a graduate of Walter Hines Page Senior High School, in Greensboro, and the University of Georgia, where he majored in speech communication. He resided in Tampa, Florida, where he trained at the Saddlebrook Academy alongside other American tennis pros such as James Blake and Mardy Fish. Currently, he resides in Dallas, Texas.  Isner married Madison McKinley, a jewelry designer, on December 2, 2017, in Bluffton, South Carolina. They have three children.

It was the Sockers' seventh indoor title in eight NASL and MISL seasons. The Sockers would win seventh games in both the semifinals and championship series.  Recap The league very nearly did not make it to the fall of 1988 as both labor negotiations and rising costs threatened to fold the league. The St. Louis Steamers, Minnesota Strikers, Cleveland Force and Chicago Sting dropped out over the course of the summer. Plans for a 60-game schedule were scrapped, and a new labor agreement was signed on July 16.  The remaining seven teams would play a 48-game schedule that would see the top five teams qualify for the playoffs. The fourth and fifth-place teams would play each other, while the first-place team would play the winner in the league semifinals. The second and third-place teams played in the other semifinal, and the semifinal winners would play in the league championship series.  After the season, the Los Angeles Lazers  folded and new franchises were placed in St. Louis and Cleveland for the 1989\u201390 season.  Teams  Regular Season Schedule  The 1988\u201389 regular season schedule ran from November 4, 1988, to April 18, 1989.

This was the first time since the 1976\u201377 North American Soccer League season that a U.S. team won a major indoor soccer championship. ## League overview In the previous three seasons, the MISL was the most prominent indoor soccer league in the United States. However, it had always been a secondary league to the outdoor North American Soccer League (NASL). In the summer of 1988, the NASL folded, and as a result, the MISL became the pre-eminent soccer league in the United States. With the NASL gone, the MISL was the only game in town, so to speak, for professional soccer players in the United States. This led to a surge in attendance and interest in the league. The league added six teams for the 1988\u201389 season, including the Chicago Power, Cleveland Crunch, Dallas Sidekicks, Denver Dynamite, Kansas City Comets, and the St. Louis Storm. The new teams brought the total number of teams in the league to 20, an all-time high. The San Diego Sockers were the two-time defending champions and heavy favorites to win a third consecutive title. They were led by indoor soccer legend Branko Segota, who finished the season with 34 goals and 32 assists. The Sockers finished with a 26\u20136 regular season record and defeated the Wichita Wings in the quarter-finals and the Tacoma Stars in the semi-finals to return to the finals. The St. Louis Storm were in their first season in the MISL, and were led by head coach Steve Govier and star forward Tony Glavin, who scored 27 goals in the regular season. The Storm finished with a 20\u201312 regular season record and defeated the Dallas Sidekicks in the quarter-finals and the Kansas City Comets in the semi-finals to reach the finals. In the two-game championship series, the Sockers defeated the Storm, 5\u20134, in the first game, and won the series, 2 games to 0, with a 4\u20133 victory in the second game. ## Regular season The 20 teams were divided into two divisions, the East and the West.

History Originally South Croydon was a terminus next to the through lines of the Brighton Line but without any platforms on them, the end of a  extension of the local lines from New Croydon, opened by the London Brighton and South Coast Railway on 1 September 1865. The aim was to provide more space for reversing local trains than could be afforded at busy New Croydon. The rapid growth of the town in this area may also have been a factor.  In 1894 the railway obtained authority to extend the local lines to Coulsdon, where they connected with the new Quarry line. The station was rebuilt as a through station with platform faces on all lines prior to the opening of the line in November 1899.  In 1947 a train crash about  south of the station killed 32 people, the worst accident in the history of the Southern Railway.  On 1 August 2011, a landslide caused by a burst water main occurred approximately  north of the station, blocking the railway for 24 hours.  Platforms   South Croydon has five platforms connected by a narrow subway.  Platforms 1 and 2 are rarely used as fast Southern services from London Victoria to Brighton, Thameslink services and Gatwick Express, and these services do not call.  Platform 3 is used by up trains to London Bridge and London Victoria.  Platform 4 is used by services that do not call, heading southbound, except some peak time services in both directions.  Platform 5 is used by down trains to Caterham and other destinations.  Ticket gates became operational in April 2009.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Operation Claw\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Operation Claw () was a joint Swedish\u2013American operation, with Norwegian support, that was carried out at Lillehammer shortly after the German capitulation by the end of World War II. Thirty-five German intelligence specialists were transferred along with various equipment first to Sweden and then to U.S. camps in occupied Germany through an agreement between the Americans and the German High Command of the Wehrmacht in Norway.  The intelligence material from Operation Claw, among it a Soviet codebook, became very useful for the Americans during the Cold War. Operation Claw was controversial both when it happened and afterwards. In 1945, it was controversial that the Americans operated in what was seen as a British controlled country, and that they secured information about its ally the Soviet Union, in cooperation with neutral Sweden. In later years,  a hypothesis that the Norwegian resistance fighter Kai Holst's sudden death in June 1945 was related to his involvement in the Operation Claw has been put forward by among others the historian Tore Pryser.  Background  Even before the war in Europe ended the various allied states had begun the search for German scientists and other German expertise. Signals intelligence had been vital during World War II and especially the British work with breaking the German codes, from the Enigma had been of huge importance. The Yalta Conference in February 1945 had revealed conflicts of interest between the western allied nations on one side and the Soviet Union and the relation was severely strained.  American intelligence organisations were very interested in German intelligence experts knowledge of the Soviet Union and immediately after the war in Europe ended they began to cooperate with the German Major General Reinhard Gehlen and his organisation Fremde Heere Ost (FHO) which had led German intelligence on the Eastern Front. It was part of an organized effort to obtain as much German intelligence information and personnel as possible; the operation had the name Target Intelligence Committee (TICOM).  The war was however still fought in East-Asia, the US and the Soviet Union were still allies and the Americans were counting on Soviet assistance in the war against Japan. The allies had designated Norway as part of the British sphere of influence. Both for the US and the neutral Sweden the operation was thus very sensitive and was conducted in great secrecy.  Swedish\u2013American cooperation  In the Wehrmacht camp at Lillehammer a group of 35 German experts on signals intelligence were gathered. They had been working on the Eastern Front against Soviet forces and had an archive and extensive knowledge about Soviet affairs. This was knowledge the Western Allies, and especially the Americans, wanted and that probably also were of use during the Cold War.  In cooperation with the American intelligence organisation Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and with knowledge and support from the Norwegian legation in Stockholm agents for the Swedish intelligence organisation C-byr\u00e5n traveled together with two Norwegian intelligence specialists to Lillehammer on May 9 and 10, 1945. The German group of experts were taken out of the camp and transported to Sweden. After a few weeks in Sweden they were on June 12 flown from Torslanda Airport close to Gothenburg to US occupied Germany and were interned in an American military camp at Wiesbaden.  The transfer to Sweden of the German experts at Lillehammer, that OSS called Operation Claw, was directed from the highest level. From the U.S. side the leader of OSS, Major General William J. Donovan was involved, from the Swedish side the chief of the Defense Staff, Major General Carl August Ehrensv\u00e4rd. The famous Swedish police director Harry S\u00f6derman was also involved from the Swedish side.  British\u2013Norwegian raid of June 1945  More than a month after the German capitulation, a British led search supported by Norwegian personnel  was executed in order to find people from Gestapo and other German key personnel that tried to hide among ordinary soldiers in German military camps. The search force that Kai Holst and other Norwegians were assisting were soon aware of that a number of German key personnel had been removed in the Swedish\u2013American operation a month earlier.  Kai Holst had been working at the military office number 4 (Mi4) at the Norwegian legation in Stockholm, and after the search he unexpectedly traveled right back to Stockholm. The next day he was found shot at the top of the staircase in an apartment building at Rind\u00f6gatan 42 on G\u00e4rdet. The official cause of death was stated as suicide, but neither Holst's family nor many of his colleagues from the resistance movement have accepted this and are of the opinion that he was liquidated. The historian Tore Pryser has put forward the hypothesis that Holst brought with him information from Lillehammer that could damage Operation Claw and thus was killed. To be able to damage the operation Kai Holst can not have been trusted as others were. He must have been considered a threat due to his contact with Alexandra Kollontaj who was ambassador in Stockholm representing Soviet Union. A possible reason for a murder of Kai Holst was thus not his knowledge as such but his connections.  Aftermath  Operation Claw was the beginning of the postwar era cooperation between Swedish and US intelligence services, in violation of Sweden's officially stated neutrality. From the American side the operation was viewed as a great success and the responsible within OSS, William T. Carlson and Joseph T. Kloman, were both honored with decorations where the operation specifically were mentioned. For the Swedish C-byr\u00e5n Operation Claw quickly became toxic. Even though the operation was to be kept confidential, information leaked to the Swedish press and C-byr\u00e5n were dissolved in February 1946.  Information regarding Operation Claw continued to be classified as confidential in the post-war years and some of it still remains so today. A report about the operation in the British National Archives is restricted until 2020.  References  Footnotes  Sources    Tore Pryser, Tyske hemmelige tjenester i Norden.

The operations were designed to test the effectiveness of the U.S. Army's new weapons and tactics against an entrenched enemy. The operations took place in the Central Highlands of South Vietnam, in an area where the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) had established base areas and logistical routes. The NVA had also built an extensive network of trenches and underground tunnels, and had positioned a large number of antiaircraft weapons in the area. The U.S. Army's 1st Infantry Division, led by Major General William E. DePuy, was chosen to conduct the operations. The division was equipped with the latest weapons and vehicles, and was trained in the latest tactics. The division's mission was to destroy the NVA forces in the area, and to break the enemy's logistical lines. The operation began on June 24, 1966, with a series of air attacks by U.S. Air Force planes. The air attacks were followed by a series of artillery strikes, and then by a ground attack by the 1st Infantry Division. The ground attack was met with strong resistance, and the fighting continued for several days. The operation was a success, and the NVA forces were defeated. The 1st Infantry Division suffered heavy casualties, but it was able to break the enemy's logistical lines and to destroy a large number of enemy weapons and vehicles. The operation also provided valuable experience for the division's soldiers, and it helped to improve the U.S. Army's tactics.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 39762269}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Calgary Tigers\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Calgary Tigers, often nicknamed the Bengals, were an ice hockey team based in Calgary, Alberta, Canada from 1920 until 1927 as members of the Big-4 League, Western Canada Hockey League and Prairie Hockey League. The Tigers were revived in 1932, playing for a short-lived four years in the North Western Hockey League. They played their games at the Victoria Arena.  Created ostensibly as an amateur team in hopes of competing for the Allan Cup, the Tigers helped form the Western Canada Hockey League in 1921 to become the first major professional team in Calgary. In 1924, after winning both the league and Western Canadian championships, the Tigers became the first Calgary based club to compete for the Stanley Cup.  After succumbing to financial pressures in 1927, the Tigers were briefly revived in the mid-1930s as a minor professional club. The Tigers competed for a total of eleven seasons in four leagues, winning four championships during their existence. Five Tigers players would later gain election to the Hockey Hall of Fame.  History  Big-4 League In 1919, under the guidance of Alberta Amateur Hockey Association league president Allan McCaw, a new elite senior amateur league was established in Alberta with two teams each in Calgary and Edmonton. The Big-4 League's intention was to compete for the Allan Cup, emblematic of Canada's national senior championship. The Tigers were created in 1920, along with the Canadians, to represent Calgary in the Big Four after the city's two original teams, the Wanderers and Columbus Crew, withdrew following the league's first season.  The Tigers also faced the Edmonton Eskimos and Dominions who served as representatives of Alberta's capital.  The Calgary teams were hosted at the Victoria Arena, which had been converted into a hockey rink in 1918.  While the Big-4 billed itself as an amateur circuit, it became known as a notorious example of a \"shamateur\" league, as amateur teams secretly employed professional players in an attempt to gain an upper hand on their competition.  When the Big Four announced their intention to compete in the Allan Cup playdowns, the Pacific Coast Hockey Association sent a letter of protest to the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association demanding that the league be declared professional, thus ineligible to compete for the Allan Cup. The Big Four ultimately chose to withdraw from the AAHA, and operated as an independent league in 1920\u201321.  The Tigers' inaugural game was played at home on December 29, 1920 as 2,500 fans saw them defeat the Edmonton Dominions 6\u20131 on the strength of a goal and two assists by Gordon Fraser.  Late in the season, the Canadians protested the use of goaltender Bill Tobin by the Edmonton Eskimos, arguing that he had not lived in Alberta long enough to be eligible per the league's residency rules. Following a last minute change of one of the arbitrators, a three-man panel denied the protest.  The decision led the front-running Tigers to refuse to play any series against the second-place Eskimos for the league championship as the team felt the Canadians' protest was improperly handled.  Efforts to reach a compromise failed as the Edmonton clubs refused to allow the protest to be reconsidered, resulting in the collapse of the league on February 24, 1921.  The Tigers remained active despite the demise of the league, playing a series of exhibition games against the Saskatoon Crescents and a team from Moose Jaw.  The Eskimos eventually agreed to face the Tigers without Tobin in an informal championship that was known as the  Intercity Championship.  The Tigers claimed the title on total-goals as they defeated Edmonton 2\u20130 in the first game at Calgary before dropping the second 2\u20131 at Edmonton.   The Tigers ended their season with a 2\u20130 exhibition loss to the defending Stanley Cup champion Ottawa Senators, who were touring the country as they travelled west to defend their title against the PCHA champion Vancouver Millionaires.  Western Canada Hockey League  The former Big Four teams joined with the Saskatoon Sheiks in forming a new professional league in 1921 that intended to compete against the National Hockey League and Pacific Coast Hockey Association. The Western Canada Hockey League was recognized as a major league and granted the right to compete for the Stanley Cup. Shortly before the inaugural season was set to begin, Calgary Canadians president Dr. C.E. Coleman and Tigers manager Eddie Poulin agreed amalgamate the two franchises under the Tigers name, allowing Calgary to present a unified front in the new league.  The Tigers played the first professional hockey game in Calgary on December 19, 1921, defeating the Regina Capitals 3\u20132 before a crowd of 3,000 fans.   The Tigers, Eskimos and Capitals battled for first place in the league, each team holding the top spot numerous times throughout the season. The Tigers and Capitals finished tied for second, forcing a two-game, total-goals playoff to determine who would meet the Eskimos for the league championship.  In the series, the Capitals defeated the Tigers 1\u20130 in Calgary, while the two teams tied 1\u20131 in Regina sending the Capitals through by a 2\u20131 aggregate total.  Prior to the start of the 1922\u201323 season, the Tigers faced the Stanley Cup champion Toronto St. Patricks in two exhibition games.   They defeated the St. Pats 7\u20135 in Calgary, and again 6\u20132 in a game held in Winnipeg, Manitoba.  The WCHL and PCHA adopted an interlocking schedule for this season, with the Tigers struggling against their pacific coast opposition, winning just two of six games. Calgary finished third in the standings, behind Edmonton and Regina, as former Tiger Barney Stanley scored the winning goal against Calgary in a 2\u20131 victory by the Regina Capitals that eliminated Calgary from playoff contention. They ended the season with a 4\u20130 exhibition victory over the NHL's Ottawa Senators in a game described as one of the \"most sensational\" games ever held in Calgary.  The 1923\u201324 season began with tragedy, as Tigers' forward Foley Martin died of blood poisoning during the team's season opening road trip to the pacific coast.  The Tigers played on despite Martin's death, winning two of three games against their PCHA rivals.  The Tigers finished atop the league standings with 37 points. They met the Regina Capitals in the league championship in a two-game, total goals series. After battling Regina to a 2\u20132 draw in the Saskatchewan capital, the Tigers returned home to Calgary, capturing the championship on home ice in a 2\u20130 victory. They then moved on to face the Vancouver Maroons of the PCHA in the best-of-three Western Canadian final. After dropping the first game in Vancouver, the Tigers came back to defeat the Maroons 6\u20133 at home, and again 3\u20131 at a neutral site game in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The victory earned the Tigers the right to play for the Stanley Cup, the first such opportunity for a Calgary-based club.  Despite defeating the Maroons, the PCHA champions were not eliminated. Rather, the Tigers earned a bye into the finals, while Vancouver met the Montreal Canadiens in the semi-final. The blue, blanc et rouge swept Vancouver in two games, setting the matchup for the 1924 Stanley Cup Finals where the Canadiens easily handled the Tigers. In the first game, played at Mount Royal Arena in Montreal, Canadiens rookie Howie Morenz recorded a hat trick as Montreal won 6\u20131. Due to poor ice conditions, the second game was moved to the Ottawa Auditorium in Ottawa. Led by goaltender Georges Vezina, Montreal won 3\u20130 to sweep the series, and claim the Cup.  Calgary began the 1924\u201325 season with a series of exhibition games in eastern Canada.  They faced the St. Pats and Senators, proving to be a popular draw in the capital as Ottawa fans lined up for tickets for the pair of games played. Additionally, the Tigers negotiated to face the NHL's expansion Montreal Maroons if the newly constructed Montreal Forum was ready in time. Those games did not come to pass. In WCHL league play, the Tigers once again finished the regular season in first place.  Led by Oliver's team leading 20 goals, the Tigers earned a bye into the WCHL championship. Their opponent was the Victoria Cougars, who moved over to the WCHL following the collapse of the PCHA the previous summer. The Tigers were unable to earn a return trip to the Stanley Cup Finals, losing the two-game total-goals series 3\u20131.  The Cougars went on to become the last non-NHL team to win the Stanley Cup. The Tigers struggled throughout the 1925\u201326 season, languishing in last place for most of the season until a 2\u20130 victory over Victoria on the last day of the season moved Calgary one point ahead of Vancouver to end the season.  The financial pressures of trying to keep up with rapidly escalating salaries took its toll on the league.  The prairie clubs, including the Tigers, were struggling under financial hardships while a mild winter of 1925\u201326 reduced the quality of the natural ice at Victoria arena which, coupled with the team's poor performance, reduced attendance.  Manager Lance Turner confirmed on May 4, 1926 that the Tigers were sold to the National Hockey League, along with the franchises in Edmonton, Regina, Victoria, Vancouver and Portland, and that the league had ceased operations. The six franchises were sold for $300,000.  Turner immediately began efforts to form a new team and league that would operate as a \"class B\" league, one level below the NHL. Three weeks after the collapse of the Western League, the Tigers were reformed as a charter member of the five team Prairie Hockey League. The team struggled to attract fans in the Prairie League, and consequently announced late in the season that it would cease operations after one year. The Tigers were successful on the ice, however, as they finished atop the league standings and met the Saskatoon Sheiks in a best-of-three series for the league title. Calgary dropped the first game, 2\u20131 in Saskatoon, but tied the series with a 2\u20131 victory in Calgary on the strength of two goals in the last five minutes by Andy Aikenhead. The Tigers were then awarded the league championship after the Sheiks defaulted the third game, refusing to play in opposition to the referee assigned for the deciding game. As Prairie champions, the Tigers traveled east to face the Winnipeg Maroons for the western Canadian professional championship. Calgary won the first game, then were awarded the title after the Maroons were unable to play the second game when the American Hockey Association rescheduled their league playoff series and created a conflict. The Tigers ended their season with exhibition games in the United States before the team was disbanded.  North Western Hockey League  In 1932, the Tigers were revived as a charter franchise of a reformed, minor-professional, Western Canada Hockey League. They opened the season with a 1\u20130 defeat in Edmonton on December 7, 1932 in what was the first professional game for either city in six years, while a near capacity crowd of 4,100 fans witnessed a 7\u20130 victory by the Tigers over the Eskimos two nights later in Calgary. The Tigers finished the season in first place with on the strength of giving up the fewest goals against during the season, but struggled to attract fans.  Attendance declined throughout the season to a low of just 560 for their victory over Saskatoon in early March that clinched the league's top record.  Overall, the team averaged 2,270 fans per game. Having earned a bye to the championship series, the Tigers faced the Eskimos in a best-of-five series marred by poor ice caused unseasonably warm weather in both cities. Following a 1\u20131 tie in the first game at Calgary, the league ordered the remaining games of the series be played in Edmonton due to the poor condition of the ice surface. The second game was also tied at 1 after bad ice in Edmonton forced it to be ended early. Two victories for the Eskimos pushed Calgary to the brink of elimination before the Tigers rebounded with a 5\u20131 victory in the fifth game.  The ties earlier in the series forced the teams to a sixth game that also went to overtime tied at 1 before the Eskimos scored to win the championship after four minutes of an extra period.  The league reformed as the North Western Hockey League following the season after the Saskatchewan clubs dropped out and were replaced with three teams on the Pacific Coast.  Calgary again won the regular-season title in 1933\u201334, advancing directly to the league championship, on the strength of a 12\u20133 victory over the Vancouver Lions in the final game of the regular season. Dutch Gainor won the league scoring title with 43 points. Fearing a repeat of the previous season's playoff disaster, the league ordered Calgary to play their championship series against the Lions in Seattle and Vancouver as both cities had arenas capable of making artificial ice. The disadvantage did not affect the Tigers in the opening game of the series, a 5\u20132 victory at Seattle. The teams traded victories in the next three contests, ending in a 2\u20131 Vancouver win in the fourth game that tied the series at 2 wins apiece. Calgary won the championship with a 6\u20131 victory before a Vancouver crowd of over 6,000 fans.  The 1934 championship would prove to be the Tigers' last hurrah, as the team fell to the bottom of the NWHL standings in 1934\u201335, winning only three games. They once again finished in last place in 1935\u201336 and were embroiled in another disputer with Edmonton over the rights to a player as the Eskimos claimed they had gained the rights to Tony Savage from the Montreal Canadiens though he had already been sent to Calgary on loan.  The Tigers issued an ultimatum to the league, threatening to disband for the season if Savage did not remain in Calgary. Savage ultimately remained with Calgary for the entire season.  1936 proved to be the final year for the Tigers, as the Great Depression and declining interest in professional hockey in favour of the senior game had threatened the team's viability. After the Eskimos announced intentions to relocate to Victoria, British Columbia as part of a realignment of the league, Tigers' manager Clair Manning contemplated relocating the franchise to Spokane, Washington. The team instead hoped to operate for another season in Calgary, but met its final demise after the NWHL reformed into the Pacific Coast Hockey League for 1936\u201337 and denied the Tigers' application to join the new league.

Exhibition games played after are not included  Hall of Famers  The WCHL's short and unstable existence was a result of salary escalation caused by having three leagues competing for top talent. As a result, by the mid-1920s, hockey players were among the highest paid athletes in North America, with top players able to demand even higher salaries than the top baseball stars of the time. Though the WCHL lasted only five years, the Tigers boasted five future Hockey Hall of Famers on their roster during that time.  Barney Stanley, a former PCHA star, spent two seasons with the Tigers from 1920\u201322. Joining the Tigers in the last season of the Big Four League, he once again turned pro when the Tigers joined the WCHL.  Stanley led the Tigers in scoring with 26 goals in 1921\u201322 before being traded to Regina.  Red Dutton, a World War I veteran who refused doctors orders to have his leg amputated after suffering a shrapnel wound, played 123 games with the Tigers before moving to the NHL where he played 449 more with the Montreal Maroons and New York Americans.  Rusty Crawford, a former standout in the National Hockey Association and National Hockey League before the war, spent three seasons in Calgary from 1922\u201325.  Crawford recorded 19 goals in 64 games as a Tiger.  Herb Gardiner began his professional career in Calgary in 1920, remaining with the Tigers until he was sold to the Montreal Canadiens in 1926, where he would go on to win the Hart Memorial Trophy as NHL Most Valuable Player in 1927.  Harry Oliver also began his pro career in Calgary, playing with the Tigers from 1921\u201326 where he scored 90 goals before being sold to the Boston Bruins. Oliver would go on to play eleven seasons in the NHL with the Bruins and New York Americans.  Head coaches Barney Stanley (1921\u201322) Herb Gardiner (1922\u201326)  Legacy The uniform of the Calgary Tigers served as the inspiration for the \"vintage\" uniform of the Calgary Flames which was worn in the Heritage Classic game in February 2011. While the Calgary Flames do not trace their ancestry back to the Tigers (the Atlanta Flames club was purchased by Calgary businessmen in the 1980s), the organization had wanted to recognize the first professional hockey club in Calgary history for this event and selected the colourful uniforms of the Tigers.

He is noted for being a technical player with set pieces and playmaking abilities. He is also capable operating at full-back and center back.  Club career  Young Lions  Zulfahmi began his footballing career with Young Lions in the S.League. After two seasons with the club, he was selected in the LionsXII squad for the 2013 season of the Malaysia Super League.  LionsXII  Zulfahmi failed to play any part in the first 6 games of the season. He was given his first start against Pahang in the MSL on 16 February 2013. Two more appearances followed until a road traffic accident in mid-April set him back a month. He managed one further start and a substitute appearance on his return as LionsXII won the 2013 Malaysia Super League.  Zulfahmi's potential was recognised as he had a run of six starts in the beginning of the 2014 campaign. Poor performances however meant that he was dropped to the bench in favour of Firdaus Kasman for the next three games. He marked his return to the starting line-up on 22 March by curling a free kick into the PKNS net to score his first LionsXII goal.  Home United  After LionsXII was disbanded, Zulfahmi went to sign for Home United for the 2016 S.League. He made 17 appearances for the protectors before leaving the club at the end of the season.  Hougang United  Zulfahmi signed for the Cheetahs ahead of the 2017 S.League season, joining former coach Phillipe Aw.  Chonburi FC  Zulfahmi's journey to Thailand happened after he made contacts with a Thai agent. Zulfahmi was on trial with second-tier Angthong FC who had wanted to start negotiations after a day. However, Zulfahmi, on the advice of his agent, traveled to Chonburi instead for a 4-day trial. After playing 60 minutes in a 2\u20133 friendly defeat to Thai Port FC, Chonburi offered him a contract which is only slightly higher than what he received at Hougang.  Zulfahmi became only the third Lion to play in the Thai top tier, after Hassan Sunny and John Wilkinson.  Zulfahmi made his debut in a 1\u20130 loss to Chiangrai United. He has started Chonburi's first two games of the Thai League 1, helping them to a draw and a loss.  Hougang United  After spending a season with Chonburi, Zulfahmi re-signed for Hougang United FC for the 2019 Singapore Premier League season.  Suphanburi  After a year back in his native Singapore, helping Hougang to a 3rd-place finish, Zulfahmi found himself back in the Thai League 1 after an agent contacted him about Suphanburi's interest. Suphanburi's coach Adebayo Gbadebo had watched videos of Zulfahmi's previous games before expressing an interest in signing him. Zulfahmi suffered a difficult 2020, playing just 8 of Suphanburi's 15 league matches in a disrupted season, having returned to Singapore in August to be with his ailing mother, who later died from breast cancer. However, he was a fixture of Suphanburi's midfield before and after he returned to Singapore. He started their first four matches before the league's coronavirus-enforced hiatus and, following his return to Thailand, he started three of Suphanburi's last four league games and came off the bench in the other one.  Samut Prakan City  Zulfahmi signed a -season deal with top-tier Thai team Samut Prakan City, after his contract with Thai League 1 side Suphanburi expired. He will play alongside his international teammate, goalkeeper Izwan Mahbud, 30, who joined the club in September.  International career Zulfahmi was first called up to the Singapore national team for a friendly match against Thailand on 24 August 2011. He was also part of the 2012 AFF Championship winning squad although he did not made any appearances in the competition.  Zulfahmi was handed his first international start against Laos on 10 October 2013.  Along with Hariss Harun, he has been identified by national coach Bernd Stange as the future of Singapore's midfield.  Zulfahmi had also been part of the Singapore squad for the 2014 and 2016 AFF Championships.  Zulfahmi finally got his first goal after winning 40 caps for the Lions in a 1\u20131 draw with Oman on 23 March 2019, scoring via a free-kick from about 23 yards out.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Salesbury\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Salesbury is a village and civil parish in Ribble Valley, located centrally in the county of Lancashire, England. The B6245 road runs straight through the village providing transport links to towns such as Blackburn, Preston and Burnley. Salesbury lies less than 5 miles north of Blackburn and approximately 2 miles south of the River Ribble.  Copster Green is an area of houses a little north of Salesbury.  History  Salesbury is first recorded as a chapelry in the ancient parish of Blackburn but in 1866 it became a civil parish. The Old English name of the village is 'Salebyry', dating from 1246 AD and 'Salewelle' dating from 1296 AD. This means 'burh by Sale Wheel' (burh is an Old English word meaning fortress). Sale Wheel is the name of a pool in the River Ribble where the river winds, contracts and foams over huge rocks and boulders within the channel and means \"pool where willows grow\". Wheel comes from the Anglo-Saxon word \"weal\" meaning a whirlpool.  The church  Initially there was no church in Salesbury, so devout landowners of the village often had private chapels. It is known that Salesbury Old Hall and Showley Hall are two of the places that housed chapels. These could be attended by tenants and servants, but for baptisms, marriages and burials people went to nearby churches in Blackburn and Ribchester. These were the Parish Church of St. Mary in Blackburn and St Wilfrid's Church, Ribchester.  As the population of Salesbury grew towards the end of the 18th Century as a result in a boom in weaving, Viscount Bulkeley and other landowners raised the money to build a Chapelry. St. Peter's Chapelry was built and consisted of a rectangular room with a bell, a chimney and a porch. It was consecrated on 8 September 1807 by the Lord Bishop of Chester. The Chapelry served its purpose for many years until 1848, when a report by the Rural Dean of Blackburn described the old church as 'having been originally very ill-built, and, in its present condition, inconvenient, uncouth, unchurchlike and ruinous.'. The building was propped up, and church life went on as usual.  In 1873 a new vicar Rev. Peter Hopwood Hart arrived and set up a committee to raise money for a new church. The old chapelry was removed and a church was re-built in the same position. The church was finally consecrated on 29 June 1887. It was known as the Jubilee Church as it was built in the year of the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria. It was built in a 'late 14th-century Gothic' design by the architects Stones & Gradwell.  The church is one of the main features in Salesbury. It boasts stained glass windows, an organ and a regular choir. The church has a graveyard which surrounds the church and includes spaces for both gravestones and cremation plaques. The current incumbent is the Reverend Elizabeth M. McLean.  Population  1881\u20131961 census The population of Salesbury has fluctuated throughout time. The 1881 census records the population to be 184 people. This was spread over 1,150 acres of land and there were thought to be 58 houses. The chapelry was so small that the residents post was sent to the local town of Blackburn where it needed to be collected. As time went on the population reached a peak in the 1930s at 350 people and begun to plateau at around an average population of 300 around 1950. This did not follow the general trend of the UK as the 1930s mostly saw a low rate of population increase. Similarly as World War II ended and marriages boomed the population also increased in to peak in the 1960s. This can be seen to a small extent on the graph but there was not a significant population change in Salesbury.  2001\u20132011 census Much of the modern village of Salesbury lies within Clayton-le-Dale parish, the main centre of population in Salesbury being Copster Green. At the 2001 UK census, the parish had a population of 391, with 1,142 in Clayton-le-Dale, whereas the 2011 UK census recorded populations of 403 and 1,128 respectively. Clayton-le-Dale is situated further down the same road and is approximately the same size if a little bigger than Salesbury, so it could be interpreted that by halving the figure a rough estimate of the population could be achieved. In the same area there were 624 houses recorded which by the same logic still shows a significant increase from the early figures of 58 houses. This increase could be due to the people who are tempted away from big towns and cities as a result of the 'rural idyll'  Employment  1881 census  In the census carried out in 1881 55% of men were employed either in agriculture (29%) or working with mineral substances (26%). These high levels of manual labour are typical of the time. At the other end of the scale the least popular forms of employment were as professionals (2%), as workers in food and lodging (3%) or in transport and communication (3%). As it could be expected the majority of women worked in domestic services or offices (22%) or in textiles and fabrics (22%). Many women were employed by the weaving trade, this was also responsible for a boom in the population towards the end of the 18th century as the craft became more popular.  2001 census  The United Kingdom Census 2001 shows a change in the types on employment in the village. The two main forms of employment are manufacturing (17%) and wholesale and retail trade (18%). It is clear that manufacturing can still be seen as a form of manual labour suggesting little change. But the increase in employment in retail and trade follows with the retail trends of the 21st century. In contrast, previously popular employment such as Fishing, Mining and quarrying all currently employ no one in the village. This shows a shift from primary employment to secondary and tertiary forms of employment.  Amenities  There are few local amenities in the village of Salesbury as the small size of the settlement and the proximity to Blackburn means that residents can easily access services elsewhere. The village's amenities include; a public house, a memorial hall, a primary school, a cricket club and of course the church.  The Bonny Inn  The Bonny Inn pub is situated in the southern part of the village on Ribchester road. It is described as a 'traditional family pub' according to The Good Pub Guide. The bar is home to 5 real ales and wines from all over the world. The pub also has a patio which boasts panoramic views of Ribble Valley.  The Memorial Hall   Salesbury Memorial Hall is located on Ribchester Road in Salesbury. It is intended for the use of the inhabitants of the village, This includes meetings, classes and leisure activities. Last years income was \u00a313,552 whilst the expenditure was \u00a310,941 leaving a profit of \u00a32.611 for the hall. The grounds surrounding and near to the Memorial Hall belong to the Wilpshire Wanderers under 5 to under 10 football teams. The ground opened in 2002 by former Blackburn and England favourite Ronnie Clayton (footballer). Ronnie was also the Honorary President of Wilpshire Wanderers Football Club until he died in 2010.  Salesbury School  Salesbury school is a mixed primary school which caters for children from ages 3\u201311. The school has 9 classes in total not including the nursery, this adds up to a total of 275 full-time pupils and 45 part-time pupils.  Salesbury Cricket Club  The cricket club (Salesbury CC) was founded in 1906, and the team initially played in the Blackburn Sunday school league. It boasts both junior and adult sections. The junior section consists of U9, U11, U13, U15 and U18 teams, and is credited with E.C.B. Clubmark Status, This shows the high quality and standard of the club. There are three adult teams, 1st, 2nd and 3rd's.

The trade journal The Moving Picture World is one that describes the storyline in its April 3 issue:  Film reviewer H. A. Downey in The Nickelodeon, another widely read trade journal in 1909, provides in its May edition a far more concise summary of Griffith's screenplay than the one found in The Moving Picture World. Downey describes the film as \"A verification of the theory that the road to the heart is through the stomach, as set forth in the case of Miguel, who, disapproving of his daughter's marriage, drives her from home, but relents for the sake of a hearty meal.\"  Another summary of this short's plot is in the extensive 1985 publication Early Motion Pictures: The Paper Print Collection in the Library of Congress. The following was composed by Library of Congress staff after reviewing a paper roll of small photographic prints preserved in the LC's collection. Those prints date from 1909 and were produced directly, frame-by-frame from Biograph's now-lost 35mm master negative of The Road to the Heart:  Cast  David Miles as Miguel, wealthy Mexican ranchero Anita Hendrie as Vinuella, Miguel's wife Herbert Yost (also credited Barry O'Moore) as Jos\u00e9 Florence Lawrence as Miguel's daughter and Jos\u00e9's wife John R. Cumpson as Chinese man Clara T. Bracy as Irish cook Mack Sennett as vaquero (cowboy) Arthur V. Johnson as vaquero (cowboy)  Production The screenplay for this short is credited to director Griffith, who shot the picture at Biograph's headquarters and main studio, which in 1909 were located inside a renovated brownstone mansion at 11 East 14th Street in New York City. Filming was completed in just two daysMarch 4 and 5, 1909by Biograph cinematographer Arthur Marvin.  The short's \"anonymous\" actors Compiling and verifying cast members in early Biograph productions such as The Road to the Heart is made more difficult by the fact that Biograph, as a matter of company policy, did not begin publicly crediting its performers and identifying them in film-industry publications or in newspapers advertisements until four years after the release of this short. In its April 5, 1913 issue, the Chicago-based trade journal Motography in a news item titled \"Biograph Identities Revealed\" announces that \"at last\" Biograph \"is ready to make known its players.\" That news item also informs filmgoers that for the price of ten cents they can purchase a poster from Biograph on which the names and respective portraits of 26 of the company\u2019s principal actors were featured.   The co-stars of this short were among many early Biograph players who performed anonymously and were consistently uncredited in their screen appearances for the studio. Florence Lawrence, in the role of Miguel's daughter in this film, was known in 1909 to theater audiences only as the \"Biograph Girl\", although within a few years after this comedy's release, she would be widely publicized as one of the top actors in the United States' motion-picture industry.  Release and reception With a film length of 618 feet and an original runtime of between nine and ten minutes, The Road to the Heart was released and distributed by Biograph on a split-reel with the 344-foot comedy Trying to Get Arrested. Few impartial reviews or comments about the film can be found in either 1909 trade publications or in city and small-town newspapers that year. Most newspaper descriptions of the short are contained in theater advertisements that circulated throughput various communities in the weeks and months after the film's release.  A Biograph \"dramedy\" In both 1909 publications and in more current references, the genre or production designation for The Road to the Heart varies. The production is cited as a drama or a \"dramatic\" in period release schedules and in Biograph advertisements for the film in trade journals; yet, in theater bills and promotions for the short in available 1909 newspapers, The Road to the Heart is cited at times as a drama but more often as a comedy. The previously cited 1985 reference Early Motion Pictures: The Paper Print Collection in the Library of Congress as well as the online source the Internet Movie Database also categorize the film as a comedy.  In August 1909 the Grand Theater in Brunswick, Georgia promoted the film in the local newspaper as \"a very clever farce comedy that is sure to please.\" The Electric Theatre in Conway, Arkansas, categorizedThe Road to the Heart as \"comic\" in its lineup of motion pictures, along with its split-reel companion comedy Trying to Get Arrested, which the theatre erroneously labeled He Tries to Be Arrested. On the other hand, the Jewel Theatre in Astoria, Oregon, like Biograph's promotions in trade publications, advertised the short as a \"Dramatic\". All of these varying descriptions and others have led to general uncertainties about the film's actual genre or type, so much so that the online reference the \"Progressive Silent Film List\" at Silent Era simply categorizes the short with question marks: \"[?]Drama?\". Given such uncertainties associated with the presence of both dramatic and comic elements in this short's plot, the production is perhaps best classified as a dramedy.  Preservation status A visual record of The Road to the Heart does exist. The Library of Congress (LC)) holds a 241-foot roll of paper images printed frame-by-frame directly from the comedy's original 35mm master negative. Submitted by Biograph to the United States government shortly before the film's release, the roll is part of the original documentation required by federal authorities for motion-picture companies to obtain copyright protection for their productions.  While the LC's paper print record is not projectable, such paper copies can be transferred onto modern polyester-based safety film stock for screening. In fact, during the 1950s and early 1960s, Kemp R. Niver and other LC staff restored more than 3,000 early paper rolls of film images from the library's collection and transferred many to safety stock. The UCLA Film and Television Archive, for example, has in its collection such a reproduction, but not one of The Road to the Heart. Instead, the archive has a copy of the first film directed by D. W. Griffith, the short Adventures of Dollie. That projectable reproduction was created from a copy of the LC's paper print of that 1908 film.  See also  D. W.

The film's sets were designed by the art director Robert A. Dietrich. ## Plot On the Mediterranean Sea a young Englishwoman, Joan Carstairs (Evi Eva), receives a wireless message from her father, James Carstairs (Henry Edwards), an engineer in Cairo. He tells her that he will be returning home to London with an Egyptian colleague, Prince Raffik (Fritz Beckmann), and his daughter, Nubi (Ellen Plessow), and asks Joan to meet them in Venice. Joan travels to Venice by train, but falls asleep and misses her stop. A young man, Antonio Salvi (Carlo Schipa), finds her and, mistaking her for a young Italian woman, offers to take her to his mother's house. Once there, his mother, Fedora (Dria D'Anziro), mistakes Joan for a young Italian woman called Nina. The Salvis are a poor but happy family, and Joan enjoys being with them, although she cannot speak Italian and they do not speak any English. She writes a note to her father, which Antonio delivers. Some time later, Prince Raffik and Nubi arrive in Venice. They go to the Salvis' house to collect Nina, who they think is Joan. When she does not appear, they ask to see a photograph of her. Antonio shows them a picture of Nina, but it is actually a picture of Joan. Prince Raffik is delighted with the resemblance, and decides that Nina (Joan) will do as a wife for his son, Prince Selim (G\u00fcnther Hadank). Antonio is sent to London to ask Sir Carstairs to come to Venice. Sir Carstairs is overjoyed to hear that his daughter is safe and well, and travels to Venice with his colleague, Lord Wilton (Fritz Beckmann). They arrive just as the wedding is about to take place. Lord Wilton explains everything to Prince Raffik, who is furious and wants to go ahead with the wedding anyway. At this moment, Nina (Joan) appears. She tells Prince Raffik that she is not Nina, but Sir Carstairs' daughter, Joan. The Prince is impressed with her honesty and decides that she will make an excellent wife for his son after all. The wedding takes place, and Joan and Antonio are united in marriage.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 67373618}

Opened in 1975, the mall's anchor stores are County Market, Pet Supplies Plus, Dunham's Sports, Ross Dress for Less, Citi Trends, Jo-Ann Fabrics, Burlington, Shoe Sensation, Slumberland Furniture, and AMC Theatres. There are 2 vacant anchor store that were once Carson's and Sears. It is managed by T Danville, a division of Tabani Group.  History Village Mall was developed in the 1970s by SES Development Company. The first store to open was an Ayr-Way discount store in 1972, which later became Target. It was followed by  a National Supermarkets and a Meis department store, which was later sold to Elder-Beerman. The mall itself opened in 1975. J. C. Penney was added in 1985. Sears, which previously had a store in downtown Danville, was offered an incentive by the city to move to the mall in the early 1990s.  Target closed in 1997 due to low sales, and by 1999 had become a Hobby Lobby. J. C. Penney closed its Danville store in 2001 along with two others in Illinois. In 2004, a wing of the mall was renovated to make room for a Goody's clothing store. The former J. C. Penney store became Steve & Barry's in 2006. That same year, several anchors were proposed for the mall, including Old Navy and Dunham's Sports. County Market, which replaced National Supermarket, was also expanded.  Hobby Lobby, Steve & Barry's, and Goody's all closed in 2008, the latter two due to bankruptcy of the chains. The loss of these stores led to rumors that the mall would close or be converted to other uses, or that Elder-Beerman or Sears would relocate to elsewhere in town.  Despite these closures, Pet Supplies Plus opened in part of the former Hobby Lobby. By 2010, the last restaurant had closed in the food court. Elder-Beerman was re-branded Carson's in 2011, and Dunham's Sports filled the rest of the former Hobby Lobby. The former Goody's space became Ross Dress for Less in mid-2012. In mid-2013, Burlington Coat Factory opened in the former J. C. Penney/Steve & Barry's space. The addition of new stores brought occupancy levels up to 78 percent. In September 2014, Sears announced that it would close the Village Mall store. In mid-2015, a Jo-Ann Fabrics was added to the mall, while the city of Danville offered an incentive to the Slumberland Furniture chain to open a store in part of the former Sears.  On January 31, 2018, The Bon-Ton Stores announced that Carson's would be closing as part of a plan to close 42 stores nationwide. The store closed in April 2018. On April 18, 2018, it was announced that The Bon-Ton Stores would be going out of business due to bankruptcy.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Into It. Over It.\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Into It. Over It. is the indie rock solo project of the Chicago, Illinois-based musician Evan Thomas Weiss. It is considered one of the leading acts in the emo revival scene of the 2010s.  History Evan Weiss grew up in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. His first exposure to emo was hearing the band Sunny Day Real Estate in the seventh grade while browsing a record shop. He continued his interest in music through buying Jade Tree and Polyvinyl records and going to local shows in Philadelphia. In the \"fourth or fifth grade\", Weiss started, with school friends, the band J.A.R., which eventually became The Progress, garnering modest local success. The Progress released an album and two EPs before breaking up in 2008. The Progress later reunited sporadically to perform one-off live shows. He was unable to convince his bandmates to play in the band full-time.   He started a solo project under the moniker Into It. Over It.. He first released music through two unorthodox concept projects: 52 Weeks, entailing the writing, recording and release of one song each week for a year (later released as a compilation); and Twelve Towns, a 12-song project initially released over six separate splits with several different bands, in which each song was named after a town. In May 2011, the band made an appearance at Bled Fest.   In June, Weiss released Into It. Over It.'s first studio album, Proper on No Sleep Records, produced by Ed Rose. In the last two months of the year, Into It. Over It. supported The Swellers on their European tour. In March and April the next year, Into It. Over It. supported The Wonder Years on the Glamour Kills Spring 2012 tour in the US. To promote the tour, a compilation showcasing the bands covering each others' songs with released. Into It. Over It.'s contribution was a cover of The Wonder Years's track \"Don't Let Me Cave In\". This was followed up in 2013 with Intersections, released on Triple Crown Records and on Big Scary Monsters in UK/Europe.  In January 2015, on a break from touring, Weiss and touring drummer Josh Sparks lived for a month in a secluded cabin in Craftsbury, Vermont, where they wrote the third Into It. Over It. album. Built for the specific purpose of allowing musicians to work in isolation, Weiss said of the location: \"We were an hour from the nearest gas station, an hour from the nearest grocery store. Totally isolated, 4ft of snow on the ground, negative 20 degrees outside. The whole thing was run on solar or generator power, so no phone, no internet.\" He and Sparks spent 13 hours a day writing music. After completing a solo tour alongside Kevin Devine and Laura Stevenson, a stint in the UK with Modern Baseball and several spring support dates for Minus the Bear, Weiss officially wrapped up touring for the Intersections album\u2014which by that time had consisted of \"well over 250 shows in a little over 15 countries\" since 2013\u2014to begin recording Into It .Over It.'s third studio album with John Vanderslice. Weiss and Sparks entered Vanderslice's Tiny Telephone Studio in June to record; Weiss recalled: \"We couldn't sweat the small stuff, you're not able to go in and tweak or micromanage little sections of the music. It helped me accept chaos in a way I couldn't before.\" Into It. Over It. continued to play shows into the end of 2015 after Weiss completed a tour with his side project Pet Symmetry in support of Dan Andriano in the Emergency Room and Jeff Rosenstock. Notable dates included Riot Fest Chicago, Weiss's solo set at The Fest, a tour in support of The Get Up Kids in December (with Weiss and Into It. Over It. touring member Rodrigo Palma playing bass for The Get Up Kids at one show), and The Promise Ring's New Year's Eve reunion show.  Into It. Over It. first revealed the upcoming release of their third album Standards through an article on SPIN, a teaser on their Facebook page, and an interview with Noisey which was accompanied by a stream of the first song from the album, \"No EQ\". Standards was released on March 11, 2016, through Triple Crown Records, and the band toured the US in support of the album alongside The World Is a Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid to Die from March to May.  Related acts Weiss was a notably active figure in underground punk and emo music as far back as 2001, and played in numerous bands from Chicago as well as around his hometown of Cherry Hill, New Jersey. He currently fronts Pet Symmetry with Erik Czaja and Marcus Nuccio of fellow emo band Dowsing, and also fronted Their / They're / There alongside Mike Kinsella of Owen and Matthew Frank of Loose Lips Sink Ships,. He plays bass in both bands despite having gained notoriety as a guitarist in Into. It Over It. Bass was the first instrument he learned and hence what he usually played.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Manic Street Preachers\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Manic Street Preachers, also known as the Manics, are a Welsh rock band formed in Blackwood in 1986. The band consists of cousins James Dean Bradfield (lead vocals, lead guitar) and Sean Moore (drums, percussion, soundscapes), plus Nicky Wire (bass guitar, lyrics). They form a key part of the 1990s Welsh Cool Cymru cultural movement.  Following the release of their debut single \"Suicide Alley\", Manic Street Preachers were joined by Richey Edwards as co-lyricist and rhythm guitarist. The band's early albums were in a punk vein, eventually broadening to a greater alternative rock sound, whilst retaining a leftist political outlook. Their early combination of androgynous glam imagery and lyrics about \"culture, alienation, boredom and despair\" gained them a loyal following.  Manic Street Preachers released their debut album, Generation Terrorists, in February 1992, followed by Gold Against The Soul in 1993 and The Holy Bible in 1994. Edwards disappeared in February 1995 and was legally presumed dead in 2008. The band achieved commercial success with the albums Everything Must Go (1996) and This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours (1998).  The Manics have headlined festivals including Glastonbury, T in the Park, V Festival and Reading. They have won eleven NME Awards, eight Q Awards and four BRIT Awards. They were nominated for the Mercury Prize in 1996 and 1999, and have had one nomination for the MTV Europe Music Awards. They have reached number 1 in the UK charts four times: in 1998, with This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours and the single \"If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next\", in 2000 with the single \"The Masses Against the Classes\", and in 2021 with The Ultra Vivid Lament. They have sold more than ten million albums worldwide.  History  Formation and early years (1986\u20131991)  Manic Street Preachers formed in 1986 at Oakdale Comprehensive School, Blackwood, South Wales, which all the band members attended. Bradfield and the slightly older Moore are cousins and shared bunk beds in the Bradfield family home after Moore's parents divorced.  During the band's early years, Bradfield, alongside the classically trained Moore, primarily wrote the music while Wire focused on the lyrics. The origin of the band's name remains unclear, but the most often-told story relates that Bradfield while busking one day in Cardiff, got into an altercation with someone (sometimes said to be a homeless man) who asked him \"What are you, boyo, some kind of manic street preacher?\"  Original bassist Flicker (Miles Woodward) left the band in early 1988, reportedly because he believed that the band were moving away from their punk roots. The band continued as a three-piece, with Wire switching from guitar to bass, and in 1988 they released their first single, \"Suicide Alley\". Despite its recording quality, this punk ode to youthful escape provides an early insight into both Bradfield's guitar work and Moore's live drumming, the latter of which would be absent from the band's first LP. The Manics intended to restore revolution to rock and roll at a time when Britain was dominated by shoegaze and acid house. The NME gave \"Suicide Alley\" an enthusiastic review, citing a press release by Richey Edwards: \"We are as far away from anything in the '80s as possible.\"  After the release of \"Suicide Alley,\" Edwards joined the band on rhythm guitar and contributed to lyrics alongside Wire. Edwards also designed record sleeves and artwork and drove the band to and from gigs.  In 1990 the Manic Street Preachers signed a deal with label Damaged Goods Records for one EP. The four-track New Art Riot E.P. attracted as much media interest for its attacks on fellow musicians as for the actual music. With the help of Hall or Nothing management, the Manics signed to indie label Heavenly Records. The band recorded their first single for the label, entitled \"Motown Junk\".  Their next single, \"You Love Us\", sampled Krzysztof Penderecki's \"Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima\" as well as Iggy Pop. The video featured Nicky Wire in drag as Marilyn Monroe and contained visual references to the film Betty Blue and to Aleister Crowley. In an interview with then-NME journalist Steve Lamacq, Edwards carved the phrase \"4REAL\" into his arm with a razor blade to prove their sincerity. He was taken to hospital and received seventeen stitches. NME subsequently ran a full-page story on the incident, including a phone interview with Richey on his motivations for doing it. A recording of the editorial meeting discussing whether or not they could publish the image was included as a b-side on the band's 1992 charity single Theme from M.A.S.H. (Suicide Is Painless), featuring Lamacq, the then-editor of NME Danny Kelly and James Brown (who went on to edit Loaded and the British version of GQ).  As a result of their controversial behaviour, the Manics quickly became favourites of the British music press, which helped them build a rabidly dedicated following. Columbia Records of Sony Music UK signed the band shortly afterwards and they began work on their debut album.  Richey Edwards era: Generation Terrorists to The Holy Bible (1992\u20131995)   The band's debut album, Generation Terrorists, was released in 1992 on the Columbia Records imprint. The liner notes contained a literary quote for each of the album's eighteen songs and the album lasted just over seventy minutes. The album's lyrics are politicised like those of the Clash and Public Enemy, with the album's songs regularly switching from a critical focus on global capitalism to more personal tales of despair and the struggles of youth. About the musical style of the album Pitchfork writer Joe Tangari wrote that Generation Terrorists \"walked a weird line between agit-punk, cock rock, romantic melodicism and glam, and was so obviously patterned after the Clash's London Calling that it was actually kind of cute.\"  Other tracks combine personal and political themes, implicating a connection between global capitalism and personal struggle; \"Nat West-Barclays-Midlands-Lloyds\" was written as a critique of overseas banking credit policies, but also concerned Richey Edwards' issues involving overdrafts and refused loans. Marc Burrows of Drowned in Sound considered the song to be an accurate prediction of \"global financial meltdown\" and its effects on everyday life. The single \"Motorcycle Emptiness\", meanwhile, criticises consumerism as a \"shallow dream\" that makes human life overtly commercialised. \"Little Baby Nothing\", a duet between Traci Lords and Bradfield, was described by Priya Elan of the NME as a \"perfect snapshot of [female] innocence bodysnatched and twisted\".  The record contained six singles and sold 250,000 copies. The success of 1996's Everything Must Go at the 1997 Brit Awards ensured that sales of Generation Terrorists and subsequent albums Gold Against the Soul and The Holy Bible enjoyed a late surge; the band's debut sold an extra 110,000 copies. The band also made a cover version of the song \"Suicide Is Painless\" which peaked at number 7 in the UK charts, spending 3 weeks in the Top 10, and giving the band their first ever Top 10 hit single.  The group's second album, Gold Against the Soul, displayed a more commercial, grungy sound which served to alienate both fans and the band itself. It was released to mixed reviews but still performed well, reaching number eight in the UK album chart. The album presents a different sound from their debut album, not only in terms of lyrics but in sound, the band privileged long guitar riffs, and the drums themselves feel more present and loud in the final mix of the album. This sound would be abandoned in their next album and as for the nature of the lyrics they also changed, with Edwards and Wire eschewing their political fire for introspective melancholy. According to AllMusic, the album \"takes the hard rock inclinations of Generation Terrorists to an extreme.\"  The band also stated that the choice to work with Dave Eringa again was important for this album: \"We finished work in November and then just went straight into a demo studio and we came out about four weeks later with the album all finished. We were all happy with all the songs, we knew what they wanted to sound like, so we didn't want to use a mainstream producer because they've got their own sound and vision of what a record should be like. So we just phoned Dave up and said 'Look, come down, let's see how this works out', and everyone loved what we were doing, so we decided to stay with him.\"  The band have described Gold Against the Soul as their least favourite album and the period surrounding the album as being the most unfocused of their career. The band's vocalist and guitarist James Dean Bradfield has said \"All we wanted to do was go under the corporate wing. We thought we could ignore it but you do get affected.\"  By early 1994, Edwards' difficulties became worse and began to affect the other band members as well as himself. He was admitted into The Priory in 1994 to overcome his problems and the band played a few festivals as a three-piece to pay for his treatment.  The group's next album, The Holy Bible, was released in August to critical acclaim, but sold poorly. The album displayed yet another musical and aesthetic change for the band, largely featuring army/navy uniforms. Musically, The Holy Bible marks a shift from the modern rock sound of their first two albums, Generation Terrorists and Gold Against the Soul. In addition to the album's alternative rock sound the album incorporates various elements from other musical genres, such as hard rock, British punk, post-punk, new wave, industrial, art rock and gothic rock.  Lyrically the album deals with subjects including prostitution, American consumerism, British imperialism, freedom of speech, the Holocaust, self-starvation, serial killers, the death penalty, political revolution, childhood, fascism and suicide. According to Q: \"the tone of the album is by turns bleak, angry and resigned\". There was also an element of autobiographic subjects, like in the song \"4st 7lb\" where the lyrics clearly tackle Richey's own experience and life. The song was named after 4 stones 7 pounds, or , because it is the weight below which death is said  to be medically unavoidable for an anorexic sufferer.  The title \"The Holy Bible\" was chosen by Edwards to reflect an idea, according to Bradfield, that \"everything on there has to be perfection\". Interviewed at the end of 1994, Edwards said: \"The way religions choose to speak their truth to the public has always been to beat them down [...] I think that if a Holy Bible is true, it should be about the way the world is and that's what I think my lyrics are about. [The album] doesn't pretend things don't exist\".  Ben Patashnik of Drowned in Sound later said that the album in the time of its release \"didn't sell very well, but its impact was felt keenly by anyone who'd ever come into contact with the Manics\", and that it is now a \"masterpiece [...] the sound of one man in a close-knit group of friends slowly disintegrating and using his own anguish to create some of the most brilliant art to be released on a large scale as music in years [...] It's not a suicide note; it's a warning.\"  In support of the album the band appeared on Top of the Pops, performing its first single, \"Faster\", which reached No.\u00a016. The performance was extremely controversial at the time, as the band were all dressed in army regalia. Bradfield wore a \"terrorist-style\" balaclava. At the time, the band was told by the BBC that they had received the most complaints ever. The album eventually has sold over 600,000 copies worldwide and is frequently listed among the greatest records ever recorded.  In April and May 1994 the band first performed songs from The Holy Bible at concerts in Thailand and Portugal and at a benefit concert for the Anti-Nazi League at Brockwell Park, London. In June, they played the Glastonbury Festival. In July and August, without Richey Edwards, they played T in the Park in Scotland, the Alte Wartesaal in Cologne, the Parkpop Festival in The Hague and the Reading Festival. During September, October and December there was a headline tour of the UK and Ireland and two tours in mainland Europe with Suede and Therapy?. In December, three nights at the London Astoria ended with the band smashing up their equipment and the venue's lighting rig, causing \u00a326,000 worth of damage.  Edwards disappeared on 1 February 1995, on the day when he and James Dean Bradfield were due to fly to the US on a promotional tour. In the two weeks before his disappearance, Edwards withdrew \u00a3200 a day from his bank account, which totalled \u00a32,800 by the day of the scheduled flight. He checked out of the Embassy Hotel in Bayswater Road, London, at seven in the morning, and then drove to his apartment in Cardiff, Wales. In the two weeks that followed he was apparently spotted in the Newport passport office, and the Newport bus station. On 7 February, a taxi driver from Newport supposedly picked up Edwards from the King's Hotel in Newport, and drove him around the valleys, including Blackwood (Edwards' home as a child). The passenger got off at the Severn View service station near Aust and paid the \u00a368 fare in cash.  On 14 February, Edwards' Vauxhall Cavalier received a parking ticket at the Severn View service station and on 17 February, the vehicle was reported as abandoned. Police discovered the battery to be flat, with evidence that the car had been lived in. Due to the service station's proximity to the Severn Bridge (which has been a renowned suicide location in the past) it was widely believed that he took his own life by jumping from the bridge. Many people who knew him, however, have said that he was never the type to contemplate suicide and he was quoted in 1994 as saying \"In terms of the 'S' word, that does not enter my mind. And it never has done, in terms of an attempt. Because I am stronger than that. I might be a weak person, but I can take pain.\"  Since then he has reportedly been spotted in a market in Goa, India, and on the islands of Fuerteventura and Lanzarote. There have been other alleged sightings of Edwards, especially in the years immediately following his disappearance. However, none of these has proved conclusive and none has been confirmed by investigators. He has not been seen since.  Manic Street Preachers was put on hold for six months and disbanding the group was seriously considered, but with the blessing of Edwards' family, the other members continued. Edwards was legally \"presumed dead\" in 2008, to enable his parents to administer his estate. The band continue to set up a microphone for Edwards at every live performance.  Everything Must Go to Lifeblood (1996\u20132006)  The first album without Edwards, Everything Must Go, was released on 20 May 1996. The band had chosen to work with new producer Mike Hedges, mainly for his work on Siouxsie and the Banshees' single \"Swimming Horses\" that Bradfield rated highly. Hedges had already been approached before to produce The Holy Bible but he wasn't available at the time. Everything Must Go debuted on the UK Albums Chart at number 2, so far the album has gone Triple Platinum in the UK and is their most successful album to date, spending 103 weeks in the Top 100 with the album still in the Top 5 a year after its release. Containing five songs either written or co-written by Edwards the album was released to overwhelmingly positive reviews. Lyrically the themes were different from their previous effort, instead of introspective and autobiographical tracks such as \"4st 7lb\", Wire's predilection for historical and political themes dominates, like the No. 2 hit single \"A Design for Life\". The song was the first to be written and released by the band following the mysterious disappearance of figurehead Richey Edwards the previous year and was used as the opening track on Forever Delayed, the band's greatest hits album released in November 2002.  James Dean Bradfield later recalled that the lyric had been a fusion of two sets of lyrics-\"Design for Life\" and \"Pure Motive\"-sent to him from Wales by bassist Nicky Wire, while he was living in Shepherd's Bush. The music was written \"in about ten minutes\" and Bradfield felt a sense of euphoria with the result. The song was credited with having \"rescued the band\" from the despair felt after the disappearance of Edwards, with Wire describing the song as \"a bolt of light from a severely dark place\". The album was shortlisted for the 1996 Mercury Prize award for best album and won the band two Brit Awards for Best British Band and Best British Album, as well as yielding the hit singles \"Australia\", \"Everything Must Go\" and \"Kevin Carter\".  Subjects tackled on the album include the tragic life of the photographer Kevin Carter, on the track of the same name, Willem de Kooning and the maltreatment of animals in captivity on \"Small Black Flowers That Grow in the Sky\" (which is a quote from the film The Best Years of Our Lives). The latter track, with lyrics by Edwards, can also be interpreted as an exploration of his mental state before his disappearance; the line \"Here chewing your tail is joy\" for instance may be as much about Richey's self-harm as it is the tormented self-injury of zoo animals. It was their most direct and mature record to date and it established the Manics as superstars throughout the world.  The album has sold over two million copies around the world, and it is still considered one of the finest releases of the decade, a classic album from the 1990s and frequently voted in polls in the category of best albums of all time by many publications.  In 1997 the band performed a special gig at the Manchester Arena for more than 20,000 people. Bassist Nicky Wire said that was the moment he knew that the band had \"made it\". The recording was released as a VHS video on 29 September 1997 and has only been reissued on DVD in Japan.  This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours (1998) was the first number 1 of the band in the UK, remaining at the top of the albums chart for 3 weeks, selling 136,000 copies in the first week and spending a total of 74 weeks in the Album Chart. The title is a quotation taken from a speech given by Aneurin Bevan, a Labour Party politician from Wales. Its working title was simply Manic Street Preachers. The cover photograph was taken on Black Rock Sands near Porthmadog, Wales. Around the world the album also peaked at number 1 in countries like Sweden and Ireland, and it sold over five million copies worldwide.  With their fifth album, the group also had a No. 1 single, \"If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next\". The song's theme is taken from the Spanish Civil War, and the idealism of Welsh volunteers who joined the left-wing International Brigades fighting for the Spanish Republic against Francisco Franco's military rebels. The song takes its name from a Republican poster of the time, displaying a photograph of a young child killed by the Nationalists under a sky of bombers with the stark warning \"If you tolerate this, your children will be next\" written at the bottom. The song is in the Guinness World Records as the number one single with the longest title without brackets. The album also included the hit singles \"You Stole the Sun from My Heart\", \"Tsunami\" and \"The Everlasting\". The Manics won Best British Band and Album awards at the BRIT Awards in 1999. This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours was also shortlisted for the 1999 Mercury Prize and the band received a further nomination in the category of Best UK & Ireland Act in the 1999 MTV Europe Music Awards, where the band performed live the single If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next. In the NME Awards in 1999, the band won every single big prize, Best Band, Best Album, Best Live Act, Best Single and Best Video, nailing also the prize for Best Band in the World Today in the Q Awards 1998.  After headlining Glastonbury Festival, T in the Park and V Festival, the band played the Leaving the 20th Century concert at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff on 31 December 1999, the first concert to be held there, with 57,000 people attending and the final song being broadcast around the world by satellite as part of 2000 Today. The concert is available on VHS and DVD. Subtitled English lyrics, available as an extra, contain errors when compared to the official lyrics in the band's album booklets and in between some of the tracks there are interview clips where the band discusses their history and the songs.  In 2000, they released the limited edition single \"The Masses Against the Classes\". Despite receiving little promotion, the single sold 76,000 copies in its first week and reached number one in the UK Singles Chart on 16 January 2000, beating \"U Know What's Up\" by Donell Jones to the top. The catalogue entry for the single was deleted (removed from wholesale supply) on the day of release, but the song nevertheless spent 9 weeks in the UK chart.  In 2001, they became the first popular Western rock band to play in Cuba (at the Karl Marx Theater) and met with President Fidel Castro. Their concert and trip to Cuba was documented and then released as a DVD entitled Louder Than War. At this concert, they revealed many tracks from their upcoming sixth album, Know Your Enemy, which was released on 19 March. The left-wing political convictions of the Manic Street Preachers are apparent in many of the album's songs, such as \"Baby Eli\u00e1n\" as they comment on the strained relations between the United States and Cuba as seen in the Eli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez affair, a hot topic around the album's release.  The band also pays tribute to singer and civil rights activist Paul Robeson in the song \"Let Robeson Sing\", but the song \"Ocean Spray\", which was a single, was written entirely by James about his mother's battle with cancer. The first singles from the album, \"So Why So Sad\" and \"Found That Soul\", were both released on the same day. The final single \"Let Robeson Sing\" was released later. The Manics also headlined Reading and Leeds Festival.  The greatest hits (plus remixes) album Forever Delayed was released in 2002, containing two new songs, \"Door to the River\" and the single \"There by the Grace of God\". Several songs were edited for length (\"Motorcycle Emptiness,\" \"You Love Us\", \"Australia,\" \"Everything Must Go,\" \"Little Baby Nothing,\" and \"The Everlasting\") so that more tracks could fit onto the CD (though not listed as edits in the liner notes).  The Forever Delayed DVD was released in 2002 together with the greatest hits CD and photo book that bear the same name, and features all the promo music videos from the start of the band's career released before the DVD. Along with the promo videos, there is a selection of 14 remix videos, where the visual material is taken from clips of the other promo videos as well as backdrop visuals from the band's live concerts. The album peaked and debuted on the UK Albums Chart at #4.  An album of B-sides, rarities, and cover versions was released in 2003 entitled Lipstick Traces (A Secret History of Manic Street Preachers), which contains the last song the band worked on with Edwards. The album received a far more positive reception from fans than the Forever Delayed greatest hits album, which was heavily criticised for favouring the band's more commercially successful singles. The only recurring criticism of Lipstick Traces was the exclusion of the fan favourite \"Patrick Bateman\", from the \"La Tristesse Durera (Scream to a Sigh)\" single. The band explained that it was excluded mainly because it was almost seven minutes long and simply would not fit on the album.  The band's seventh studio album, Lifeblood, was released on 1 November 2004 and reached No.\u00a013 on the UK album chart. Critical response to the album was mixed. The album was more introspective and more focused on the past, Wire talked about the ghosts that haunted this record and stated that the record was a retrospective: \"The main themes are death and solitude and ghosts. Being haunted by history and being haunted by your own past. Sleep is beautiful for me. I hate dreaming because it ruins ten hours of bliss. I had a lot of bad dreams when Richey first disappeared. Not ugly dreams, but nagging things. Until we wrote 'Design for Life', it was six months of misery. Lifeblood doesn't seek to exorcise Edwards' ghost, though, just admits that there are no answers\". Tony Visconti helped the band produce three songs on the album, which was followed by a UK arena tour in December 2004. \"Empty Souls\" and \"The Love of Richard Nixon\" were the two singles released from the album, both reaching No. 2 in the UK.  A tenth-anniversary edition of The Holy Bible was released on 6 December 2004, which included a digitally remastered version of the original album, a rare U.S. mix (which the band themselves have admitted to preferring to the original UK mix) and a DVD of live performances and extras including a band interview.  In April 2005, the band played several shows as the Past-Present-Future tour\u2014announced as their last for at least two years. The band released an EP entitled God Save the Manics with only a limited number of copies available and given out to fans as they arrived at the venue. After all the copies were gone, the band made the EP available as a free download on their website. In September, the band contributed the new track \"Leviathan\" to the War Child charity album Help!: A Day in the Life.  In 2006 the band received the prize for the Q Merit Award in the Q Awards 2006 and also the 10th-anniversary edition of Everything Must Go was released on 6 November. It included the original album, demos, B-sides, remixes, rehearsals and alternate takes of the album's songs, spread out over two CDs. An additional DVD, featuring music videos, live performances, TV appearances, a 45-minute documentary on the making of the album, and two films by Patrick Jones, completed the three-disc set.  In the 10th-anniversary edition, the band itself claims that they're still fond of the record, and Wire goes further saying: \"I think it's our best record, I am not afraid to say that.\"  Send Away the Tigers to National Treasures (2007\u20132012)   The band's eighth studio album, Send Away the Tigers, was released on 7 May 2007 on Columbia Records. It entered the official UK album charts at No.\u00a02. Critical response to the album was largely positive, with some critics hailing the album as the band's best in a decade. A free download of a song entitled \"Underdogs\" from the album was made available through the group's website on 19 March 2007.  The first official single released from Send Away the Tigers was \"Your Love Alone Is Not Enough\", which features Cardigans vocalist Nina Persson and according to the band they always had a duet in mind, seeing that the lyrics have a question/reply style to it. According to singer Bradfield, the title was the last line of a suicide note left by the friend of someone close to the group. The second single, \"Autumnsong\", and a third, \"Indian Summer\", were released in August. \"Indian Summer\" peaked at number 22, making it the first Manics single not to chart in the Top 20 since 1994's \"She Is Suffering\". The album sleeve features a quotation from Wyndham Lewis: \"When a man is young, he is usually a revolutionary of some kind. So here I am, speaking of my revolution\".  The band ended up promoting the album with appearances in the summer festivals like Reading and Leeds Festivals and Glastonbury Festival.  The band released a Christmas single, \"The Ghosts of Christmas\", in December. The track was available as a free download on their official website throughout December 2007 and January 2008. In February 2008, the band were presented with the God-Like Geniuses Award at the NME Awards ceremony.  The ninth Manics album, Journal for Plague Lovers, was released on 18 May 2009 and features lyrics left behind by Edwards. Wire commented in an interview that \"there was a sense of responsibility to do his words justice.\" The album was released to positive critical reviews and reached No. 3 on the UK Album Chart. However, the cover of the album generated some controversy, with the top four UK supermarkets stocking the CD in a plain slipcase, as the cover was deemed \"inappropriate\". Bradfield regarded the decision as \"utterly bizarre\", and has commented: \"You can have lovely shiny buttocks and guns everywhere in the supermarket on covers of magazines and CDs, but you show a piece of art and people just freak out.\"  Several tracks refer to Edwards' time in a couple of hospitals in 1994. Among them is \"She Bathed Herself in a Bath of Bleach\", of which James Dean Bradfield said to the NME: \"There're some people he met when he was in one of the two places having treatment and I think he just digested other people's stories and experiences.\" The final track, \"William's Last Words\", has been compared to a suicide note, and although Nicky Wire rejects this suggestion, Bradfield observes, \"you can draw some pretty obvious conclusions from the lyrics.\" Wire, who admitted finding the task of editing this song \"pretty choking\", eventually composed the music and sang lead vocals after Bradfield found himself unsuited to the task.  Bradfield commented that Journal for Plague Lovers was an attempt to finally secure the legacy of their former member Richey Edwards and the result was that, during the recording process, it was as close to feeling his presence since his disappearance: \"There was a sense of responsibility to do his words justice. That was part of the whole thing of letting enough time lapse. Once we actually got into the studio, it almost felt as if we were a full band; it [was] as close to him being in the room again as possible.\"  Tracks from Journal for Plague Lovers have been remixed by a number of artists, and the Journal for Plague Lovers Remixes EP was released on 15 June 2009. Martin Noble of the band British Sea Power remixed the song \"Me and Stephen Hawking\"; Andrew Weatherall remixed \"Peeled Apples\", which he has described as \"sounding like Charlie Watts playing with PiL\"; The Horrors remixed \"Doors Closing Slowly\"; NYPC remixed the song \"Marlon J.D\" and the EP also features remixes by Patrick Wolf, Underworld, Four Tet, Errors, Adem, Optimo and Fuck Buttons.  On 18 June 2009, the Manics officially opened the new Cardiff Central Library. Wire later said in an interview with The Guardian that the occasion had been a great honour for the band:  On 1 June 2010, the band announced on their homepage that a new album called Postcards from a Young Man would be released on 20 September. James Dean Bradfield said that the album would be an unashamedly pop-orientated affair, following 2009's Journal for Plague Lovers. \"We're going for big radio hits on this one\", he told NME. \"It isn't a follow-up to Journal for Plague Lovers. It's one last shot at mass communication.\"  On 26 July, the first single from the new album, \"(It's Not War) Just the End of Love\", was played on the breakfast shows of BBC Radio 2, BBC 6Music, XFm and Absolute Radio. It was released on 13 September. The title had previously been suggested as a working title for the album by Nicky Wire. Three collaborations were also confirmed on the band's website later that day: Duff McKagan would appear on \"A Billion Balconies Facing the Sun\", Ian McCulloch will add guest vocals to \"Some Kind of Nothingness\" and John Cale will feature on \"Auto-Intoxication\". Of the album's lead single, \"(It's Not War) Just the End of Love,\" Nicky Wire claimed: \"I believe in the tactile nature of rock 'n' roll. There's a generation missing out on what music meant to us...You can only elaborate on the stuff that compels you to. But \"It's Not War...\" is kind of saying, \"Alright, we're not 18, but even at 40 the rage is still there\".  Postcards from a Young Man was recorded with producer (and longtime Manics collaborator) Dave Eringa and was mixed in America by Chris Lord-Alge. It was released in a standard version, 2 CD deluxe version, and limited edition box set. The album cover art uses a black and white photograph of British actor Tim Roth.  The album was supported by the Manics' most extensive tour of the UK to date, starting in Glasgow on 29 September 2010. British Sea Power were the support act for the band on the tour. Two further singles were released from the album\u2014the McCulloch-featuring \"Some Kind of Nothingness\" and the title track \"Postcards from a Young Man\". \"Some Kind of Nothingness\" peaked at No. 44 in the UK making it the first-ever Manics single to not make the Top 40 since they signed to Sony in 1991.  The band initially announced that their next album had the working title 70 Songs of Hatred and Failure and would sound very different from Postcards From A Young Man: \"The next album will be pure indulgence. There's only so much melody stored in your body that you can physically get onto one record. It was just so utterly commercial and melodic.\" However, Nicky Wire contradicted this in 2011 while doing promotion for their greatest hits compilation National Treasures. When asked why the band was releasing the compilation Wire stated: \"It's just the end of an era. Not the end of a band. We're gonna disappear for quite a long time.\"  National Treasures \u2013 The Complete Singles was released on 31 October 2011, preceded by the release of the single \"This Is the Day\", a cover of the song by The The. On 17 December 2011, the group performed 'A Night of National Treasures' at O2 Arena in London to celebrate the band's 25 years to date, and enter into a period of hiatus where the eleventh album was written. The band performed all 38 singles, with around 20,000 people in attendance, as well as guest performers including Nina Persson from the Cardigans who sings with the band on the single \"Your Love Alone Is Not Enough\" and Gruff Rhys from Super Furry Animals who sang with the band that night on the track Let Robeson Sing. In April and May 2012, the band embarked on a European greatest hits tour. The compilation was voted by NME magazine as the best re issue of 2011, beating Nirvana's deluxe and super deluxe edition of Nevermind to the top spot.  Despite the \"complete singles\" title, National Treasures does not contain every Manic Street Preachers single. Notable omissions are the band's very first single, \"Suicide Alley\" (1989), \"Strip It Down\" from the New Art Riot EP (1990), for which the band's first promotional video was made, and \"You Love Us (Heavenly Version)\" (1991). For singles originally released as double-A sides, only one song is included: therefore from \"Love's Sweet Exile/Repeat\" (1992) and \"Faster/P.C.P.\" (1994), only the first of each pair are included.  On 10 October the band announced via Facebook that a film-interview-documentary about their album Generation Terrorists would be screened at 2012's  Festival as a Welsh exclusive. The film was shown at Chapter Arts Centre on Saturday 20 October, with all profits being donated to Young Promoters Network. The film was made available in the 20th-anniversary re-issue of Generation Terrorists, of which there were five editions:   Single Disc edition: Original Album  2 Disc Deluxe edition: Includes Original Album + Demos with DVD of Culture, Alienation, Boredom, Despair (A making of the album)  4 Disc Limited edition (3,000 copies worldwide): Includes Original Album, Demos, B-Sides, Rarities, CABD DVD + Replica of Generation Terrorist Tour VIP Pass, 10\" Collage by Richey Edwards, 10\" Vinyl LP of a rare Manics Radio Performance and a 28-page book from Nicky Wire's archive.

Rewind the Film to The Ultra Vivid Lament (2013\u2013present)  In May 2013, the band announced an Australasian tour for June and July, that would see them play their first-ever show in New Zealand. This tour coincided with the British and Irish Lions rugby tour to Australia and the Melbourne concert on the eve of the 2nd Test featured Lions' centre Jamie Roberts as a guest guitarist on \"You Love Us\".  In May 2013 the Manics released information about their most recent recording sessions, saying that they had enough material for two albums; the first would be almost exclusively without electric guitars. The name of the first album and title track was revealed to be Rewind the Film on 8 July. In a statement, the band announced, \"(If) this record has a relation in the Manics back catalogue, it's probably the sedate coming of age that was This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours.\" The band also stated via Twitter, \"MSP were in the great Hansa Studios in January with Alex Silva (who recorded The Holy Bible with us). Berlin was inspirational... Sean been playing a french horn in the studio today\u2014sounding wonderful.\"  The lead single of the album, \"Show Me the Wonder\", was referred to on their Twitter account, the Manics posted, \"I think 'show me the wonder' is the 1st ever manics single without JDBs electric guitar on-xx.\" The single was released on 9 September 2013 to a positive critical reception. The album itself was released on 16 September 2013 and reached No. 4 on the UK Album Chart. The second single of the album \"Anthem for a Lost Cause\" was released on 25 November 2013.  The other album, Futurology, the band's twelfth studio album, was released on 7 July 2014 and it received immediate critical acclaim. The lead single from the album, \"Walk Me to the Bridge\", was released as a digital download on the day of the announcement, on 28 April.  Futurology, according to the band, is an album full of ideas and one of their most optimistic yet, as Wire said to the NME magazine in an interview: \"There's an overriding concept behind 'Futurology' which is to express all the inspiration we get from travel, music and art\u2014all those ideas, do that in a positive way. 'Rewind The Film' was a harrowing 45-year-old looking in the mirror, lyrically. 'Futurology' was very much an album of ideas. It's one of our most optimistic records, the idea that any kind of art can transport you to a different universe.\"  The album sold about 20,000 copies in its first week and reached No. 2 on the UK Albums Chart. The title track, \"Futurology\", was the second and final single released from the album on 22 September, the video debuted on YouTube on 10 August. The video was directed by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts winner Kieran Evans, who worked with the band on videos from their previous effort Rewind The Film. The band promoted the album with a tour around the UK and Europe from March to May 2014, they also made appearances in festivals like T in the Park in Scotland and Glastonbury Festival in the summer.  Late in 2014, the band celebrated the release of their seminal album The Holy Bible with a special edition in December, commemorating the 20th anniversary of the album. This edition includes the vinyl edition of the full album, plus a three-CD set, the first CD with the full album remastered for the special release, the second with the US mix remastered and the third including a performance at the Astoria in 1994 and an acoustic session for Radio 4 Mastertapes in 2014. The special edition also contains a 40-page book full of rare photos and handwritten lyrics and notes by Richey and by the band. In the NME Awards 2015, the album won \"Reissue of the Year\".  They also toured the album, playing it in full for the very first time. After the tour in the UK, the Manics took The Holy Bible tour to North America, in April 2015, they played in Washington DC, Toronto, New York, Boston, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Chicago. They also played in the Cardiff Castle on 5 June 2015 with 10,000 fans attending the gig, it was broadcast nationwide by BBC Two Wales.  In August 2015 the Manic Street Preachers nailed the 2 top spots on the best NME covers of all time, as voted by the general public.  James Dean Bradfield and Sean Moore in November 2015 did a charity hike in Patagonia, Nicky Wire did not participate in the event, the band said: \"In November 2015 we will be walking in the footsteps of our Welsh ancestors when we will be part of the Velindre group of 50 people celebrating the 150th anniversary of Welsh settlers arriving in Patagonia with a challenging six-day trek.\"  Also in November 2015, the Manic Street Preachers announced that they were going to celebrate the 20th anniversary of their 1996 album Everything Must Go, with their biggest headline show since 1999, in the Liberty Stadium, in Swansea on 28 May 2016, featuring special guests like Super Furry Animals. The album was performed in full, with Nicky Wire teasing \"b-sides, rarities and curios, greatest hits and a few brand-new songs\". Before the final show in Swansea the band played: Liverpool, Echo Arena (13 May), Birmingham, Genting Arena (14 May), London, Royal Albert Hall (16\u201317 May), Leeds, First Direct Arena (20 May) and Glasgow, the SSE Hydro (21 May). In early 2016 the band announced the European tour of \"Everything Must Go\", they played across Europe, in Finland, Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany. Similar to what happened with \"The Holy Bible\" the Manics released on 20 May, a special anniversary edition for the album, which includes the full album remastered plus the B-sides, a heavyweight vinyl, the 1997 Nynex concert fully restored on DVD, a film about the making of the album, the official videos for the all singles and a 40-page booklet. It was also made available a standard edition with a double-CD featuring only the remastered album and the concert at the Nynex Arena.  The band announced in March 2016 that they would be releasing a theme song for the Wales national team ahead of the UEFA Euro 2016 tournament in the summer, entitled \"Together Stronger (C'mon Wales)\", it was released on 20 May, featuring also a video with the band and the Welsh team, the Manics tweeted: \"It's with great pride we can announce the Manics are providing the official Wales Euro 2016 song \u2013 'Together Stronger (C'mon Wales)'\". All profits from the song went to the Princes Gate Trust and Tenovus Cancer Care. On 8 July the band was at the Cardiff City Stadium to give a home welcome to the Wales football national team after they were knocked out of the UEFA Euro 2016 by Portugal in the semi-finals, the band played a few songs in the stadium including the official theme song \"Together Stronger (C'mon Wales)\". On the next night, 9 July, the Manics headlined a night at the Cornwall's Eden Project, and later the band managed to secure a new recording studio near Newport, Wales. The city's council ensured that only the band can use the studio, there would be an increase on-site parking and a series of soundproofing measures to ensure nearby properties aren't disturbed by noise. To end the summer, the Manics went on to headline another two festivals, Wasa Open Air in Finland in mid-August and in late August the Victorious Festival in Portsmouth. The band also received a nomination in the 25th British Academy Cymru Awards for the best live outside broadcast after their 2015 gig in the Cardiff Castle, celebrating the 20th anniversary of the \"Holy Bible\".  In February 2017 the band revealed a teaser trailer for a documentary entitled Escape from History, charting the band's journey from The Holy Bible, through to the disappearance of lyricist and guitarist Richey Edwards, to the huge success of Everything Must Go. The documentary aired on Sky Arts on 15 April. The band also stated that they would release an album later in that year.  The band released a special edition of their album Send Away the Tigers on 12 May. 2017 marks the 10th anniversary of the record and the Manics said that \"this is a very important album\" in their career. The special edition featured a remastered album as well as B-sides and rarities spread over two discs, plus a DVD which features the band's 2007 Glastonbury performance, rehearsal footage, an album track-by-track, and promo videos.  On 17 November 2017, the band announced that their thirteenth album, Resistance Is Futile, would be released on 13 April 2018. After much delay, the band wrote \"The main themes of 'Resistance is Futile' are memory and loss; forgotten history; confused reality and art as a hiding place and inspiration\", the band say in a statement. \"It's obsessively melodic\u2014in many ways referencing both the naive energy of 'Generation Terrorists' and the orchestral sweep of 'Everything Must Go'. After delay and difficulties getting started, the record has come together really quickly over the last few months through a surge of creativity and some old school hard work.\" It is the first album to be recorded at the \"Door to the River\" studio.  In January 2018, Manic Street Preachers signed a publishing contract with Warner/Chappell Music, leaving their longtime home Sony/ATV Music Publishing.  On the album, the Manics launched their first single \"International Blue\" as a download on 8 December 2017. The second single \"Distant Colours\" was released, also as a download, on 16 February 2018. About the first single the band said that there's was certain naive energy and widescreen melancholia on the song that is reflected through the whole album, comparing it to Motorcycle Emptiness. Furthermore, the album focused on \"(...)things that make your life feel a little bit better. Rather than my internalised misery, I tried to put a sense of optimism into the lyrics by writing about things that we find really inspiring.\" Said Wire, taking inspiration from David Bowie and seen as almost an escape and a wave of optimism, just like the previous album was described.  On the other hand, \"Distant Colours\" was written by James Dean Bradfield, rather than Nicky Wire, and inspired by disenchantment and Nye Bevan's old Labour. He said: \"Musically, the verse is downcast and melancholic and the chorus is an explosion of disillusionment and tears.\" The third single \"Dylan & Caitlin\" was released as a download on 9 March 2018. The fourth single \"Liverpool Revisited\" is about a magical day in the city, Nicky added that: \"It was on the Everything Must Go (anniversary) tour and I got up really early at sunrise to walk around Liverpool, polaroid camera in hand on a balmy day. It sounds clich\u00e9d I know, but Liverpool in the sun does take on a hypnotic quality, with the Mersey and the stone.\" The band also revealed that they were to support Guns N' Roses during their summer tour. The fifth and final single, \"Hold Me Like a Heaven\", was released as a download on 4 May 2018. Wire said that the song was inspired musically by David Bowie's Ashes to Ashes, something that the band wanted to write about, and Nicky thinks that this the closest that the band is going to get, sharing also that lyrics were informed by the work of Philip Larkin.  The album sold around 24,000 copies in the first week, entering the UK Albums Chart at number 2, despite being number 1 during the week. It was the highest new entry on the chart, and on physical sales the album peaked at number 1, both on CD and vinyl.  In October 2018, the band announced a twentieth-anniversary collector's edition re-release of This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours. It was made available on digital, CD, and vinyl, with the CD edition featuring bonus demos, live rehearsal recordings, remixes, and B-sides. The album was launched on 7 December 2018 and to promote it, the band went on tour in Spring and Summer 2019, performing the album in full alongside other content.  In March 2020, the Manics announced a deluxe reissue of their Gold Against the Soul album for release on 12 June 2020. Bonus content included previously unreleased demos, B-sides from the era, remixes, and a live recording, while the CD was released alongside a book of unseen photographs from the era with handwritten annotations and lyrics from the band. The next day, the unnamed follow-up album to Resistance is Futile, their fourteenth overall, was confirmed to NME alongside Bradfield's second solo album. The group's album, including a track called \"Orwellian\", was described as \"expansive\" and is due for release in Summer 2021.  On 14 May 2021, the Manics announced the title of their fourteenth studio album: The Ultra Vivid Lament.  The first single from the album, \"Orwellian\", was released on the same day. \"The Secret He Had Missed\", the second single from the album, was released on 16 July 2021. The Ultra Vivid Lament was released on 10 September 2021 and received generally positive reviews from critics: on Metacritic, the album has a weighted average score of 78 out of 100 based on 12 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".  The album sold 27,000 copies in the first week, granting the band their second UK Number 1 album as they narrowly beat Steps to the number 1 spot.  Solo work  In late 2005, both Bradfield and Wire announced that they intended to release solo material before a new album by the band. A free download of Nicky Wire's debut solo offering I Killed the Zeitgeist was posted on the band's website for just one day, Christmas Day 2005, while \"The Shining Path\" was released exclusively on iTunes for download. Also, a promotional album sampler had been sent out to the press and certain other people which included \"I Killed the Zeitgeist\", \"Goodbye Suicide\", \"Sehnsucht\", and \"Everything Fades\".  The album was officially released in September 2006. It charted at No.\u00a0130 in the UK. The sound of the album, which Nicky referred to as his \"nihilistic anti-everything album\", was inspired by, among others, Neu!, the Plastic Ono Band, Einst\u00fcrzende Neubauten, the Modern Lovers, Richard Thompson and Lou Reed. Only one official single was released, \"Break My Heart Slowly\", which charted at No.\u00a074. Nicky toured small intimate venues across the UK with his band the Secret Society.  Bradfield's solo album, The Great Western, was released in July 2006, to positive reviews from critics. It reached No.\u00a022 in the UK. The sound of the album was inspired by, among others, Jeff Beck, Badfinger, Simple Minds and McCarthy. Two singles were released: \"That's No Way to Tell a Lie\" (No.\u00a018) in July, which was also the background music to the BBC's Match of the Day's 'Goal of the Month' competition, and then \"An English Gentleman\" (No.\u00a031) in September. The latter is in remembrance of the first Manics manager Philip Hall, who died from cancer in 1993 and to whom The Holy Bible had been dedicated. The initial pressings of the red 7\" single were made with black vinyl, some of which were sent out to distributors by mistake. James toured the album with a band that included Wayne Murray, who would subsequently play the second guitar for Manics live performances. James's solo gigs featured covers of the Clash songs \"Clampdown\" and \"The Card Cheat\", both from the album London Calling.  In a later interview, when the band were collectively asked what they had learned from making a solo album, Sean Moore dryly quipped \"Not to do one\".  In March 2020, Bradfield was confirmed to be working on a second album while the band took a short break, while Wire was also considering more solo content. That June, two tracks by Bradfield, \"There'll Come a War\" and \"Seeking the Room With the Three Windows\", were released digitally. The album title was announced as Even in Exile the next week alongside the launch of its first single, \"The Boy From the Plantation\", and the album was released on 14 August 2020. The album was generally well-received and peaked at no.6 in the UK Albums Chart  Collaborations and covers   The band released a split single in 1992 with the Fatima Mansions, a rock cover of \"Suicide Is Painless\", which became their first UK Top 10 hit. They have recorded many cover versions of songs by other artists, primarily as B-sides for their own singles. Bands and artists to whom the group have paid tribute in this way include the Clash, Guns N' Roses, Alice Cooper, Happy Mondays, McCarthy, Chuck Berry, Faces and Nirvana.  The band's first musical appearance since Edwards' departure was recording a cover of \"Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head\" for The Help Album, a charity effort in 1995 in support of aid efforts in war-torn Bosnia and Herzegovina.  The Lightning Seeds' song \"Waiting for Today to Happen\", from their fifth album, Dizzy Heights (1996), was written by Nicky Wire and Ian Broudie. That same year, James Dean Bradfield and Dave Eringa produced Northern Uproar's first single, \"Rollercoaster/Rough Boys\". The 808 State song \"Lopez\" (1997) features lyrics by Wire and vocals by Bradfield. It is featured on their greatest hits album, 808:88:98. Kylie Minogue's sixth album, Impossible Princess (1997), features two songs co-written and produced by the Manics: \"Some Kind of Bliss\" (Bradfield, Minogue and Sean Moore) and \"I Don't Need Anyone\" (Bradfield, Jones and Minogue) were produced by Bradfield and Dave Eringa. Bradfield provided backing vocals, bass guitar and production for the Massive Attack song \"Inertia Creeps\" (1998), which features on their successful third album, Mezzanine. Patrick Jones's album of poetry set to music, Commemoration and Amnesia (1999), features two songs with music written by Bradfield: the title track and \"The Guerilla Tapestry\". Bradfield plays the guitar on both songs. Furthermore, the track \"Hiraeth\" features a section called \"Spoken Word\", in which Nicky Wire talks about Welsh identity.  In February 2006, the band contributed a cover version of \"The Instrumental\" to the album Still Unravished: A Tribute to the June Brides.  In February 2008, the Manics covered Rihanna's hit pop song \"Umbrella\". Their version appeared on a CD titled NME Awards 2008 given away free with a special souvenir box-set issue of NME magazine, which went on sale 27 February. Additionally, the Manics' version of the song was made available on iTunes from 5 March 2008. Despite being chart-eligible (it reached number 47 in the UK), the release was not intended as an official single. Two further versions (the Acoustic and Grand Slam mixes) were later made available on iTunes and now comprise a three-track Umbrella EP.  James Dean Bradfield and Nicky Wire contributed an original song, \"The Girl from Tiger Bay\", to Shirley Bassey's 2009 studio album, The Performance.  Musical style and influences  Manic Street Preachers' music has been variously described as  alternative rock, Britpop, hard rock glam rock, pop rock, punk metal, and punk rock.  The band have stated that the Clash were \"probably our biggest influence of all\". When they saw them on television, \"we thought it was fantastic and got really excited. They were the catalyst for us\". In addition, they have cited artists including Aerosmith, Alice in Chains, Electric Light Orchestra, Rory Gallagher, Gang of Four, Guns N' Roses, Joy Division, Magazine, PiL, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Skids, Bruce Springsteen, and Wire, as influential or inspirational to their music. Bradfield's guitar hero is guitarist John McGeoch: \"He taught me, you can have that rock'n'roll swagger, but still build something into it that's really unsettling, and can cut like a razor blade\".  Alluding to the band's early relationship with Britpop, Cam Lindsay of Canadian music publication Exclaim! opined that \"Britpop was rising, the Manics were offering the polar opposite: a bleak, uncompromising work that wanted nothing to do with the party\".

From 1898 until the district's closure in 1917, Piazza worked as a madam and specialized in providing octoroon women for her clients; she herself was mixed-race.  Early life Little is known about Piazza's early life. Her parents, Italian immigrant Vincent Piazza and woman of colour, Celia Caldwell, were both still teenagers and unmarried at the time of her birth. Their daughter had at least two other siblings. Piazza was born in Copiah County, Mississippi and first moved to New Orleans in the mid-1890s.  \"Countess\" Willie Piazza Operating for a period of about twenty years, Piazza became known in Storyville for her brothel parlor. She was one of several women of mixed ancestry to operate brothels in the area, Lulu White being perhaps the most prominent. Purchasing her 317 N. Basin Street premises for $12,000 in 1907, she spent an additional $30,000 on furnishings and other upgrades; the brothel was immediately successful, allowing Piazza to pay off the mortgage within two years. Piazza's \"girls\" were known around New Orleans for their fine clothes, private coaches, and for their abilities to sing and play musical instruments; jazz pianist Jelly Roll Morton sometimes played her upright white piano. The average annual income for a Willie Piazza octoroon was thought to be $1,000-$2,000. Piazza herself became known as \"Countess Willie Piazza\" and cultivated an image of European sophistication. She used a \u201ctwo foot ivory, gold and diamond\u201d cigarette holder to smoke Russian cigarettes.  After the closure of Storyville in 1917, Piazza continued to work as a prostitute and procuress.  Piazza was one of the main characters (played by Virginia Mayo) in the 1978 Dennis Kane film French Quarter.  Death Willie Piazza died from cancer on November 2, 1932, in New Orleans.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Alhambra Theatre of Variety\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Alhambra was a popular theatre and music hall located on the east side of Leicester Square, in the West End of London. It was built originally as the Royal Panopticon of Science and Arts opening on 18 March 1854. It was closed after two years and reopened as the Alhambra. The building was demolished in 1936. The name was also adopted by many other British music hall theatres located elsewhere; in Bradford, in Hull and in Glasgow etc. The name comes from association with the Moorish splendour of the Alhambra palace in Granada, Spain.  History  Origins The Alhambra was originally known as the Royal Panopticon and was a landmark building at 23\u201327 Leicester Square, completed in 1854 by T. Hayter Lewis as a venue for showcasing the finest in the arts and for scientific demonstrations and popular education. This lasted for two years, and then the decision to add a circus ring was taken. When it reopened on 3 April 1858 it was renamed the Alhambra.  The 1858 building  conversion to the Alhambra Circus, was also by T. Hayter Lewis. It had a  frontage and was very tall for the time. It was built in a Moorish style, with lavish fenestration, two towers and a dome, similar to the eponymous Bradford theatre in architectural style. It was a complete contrast with the neighbouring buildings. Inside there was a central rotunda  in diameter and  high. There was a secondary entrance to the rear on Charing Cross Road.  The Leicester Square theatre's name was changed frequently, but usually reflected the building's (very loose) stylistic associations with the celebrated Alhambra in Granada, Spain. By 1864, the circus had become the Alhambra Music Hall. Rebuildings occurred in 1866 and 1881, by Perry and Reed. From 1871, when it obtained a licence, an equestrian ballet was performed. From 1872 to 1898 (except for 1883\u201384) Georges Jacobi was musical director of the Alhambra. Over the years he composed more than 100 works for ballet, many of them performed at the Alhambra where for some years the prima ballerina was Emma Palladino.  The Alhambra was destroyed by fire in 1882, and was rebuilt in a more restrained style by Reed, reopening in 1884 as the Alhambra Theatre. Further rebuildings were in 1888 by Edward Clark, 1892 by Clark and Pollard, 1897 by W. M. Brutton, and in 1912 by the prolific theatre architect, Frank Matcham. Other names used during the life of the theatre were the Royal Alhambra Palace; Alhambra Theatre of Varieties; Theatre Royal, Alhambra; Great United States Circus and New Alhambra Theatre.  Entertainments London's Alhambra was predominantly used for the popular entertainment of the day, music hall. The usual music hall acts were performed, as well as the d\u00e9but of Jules L\u00e9otard performing his aerial act, above the heads of diners in May 1861. Other entertainments included \"patriotic demonstrations\" celebrating the British Empire and British military successes. The theatre also staged ballet and light opera.  In the 1860s, John Hollingshead took over management at the Alhambra and made it famous for its sumptuous staging, alluring corps de ballet and the notorious front-of-house Promenade bar.  At its bars, the attractions of the Alhambra's ballet were not merely artistic:  The Can-Can as presented at the Alhambra by the 'Parisian Colonna' troupe proved so sexually provocative that in October 1870 the Alhambra was deprived of its dancing licence.  Another example of the fare on offer was this 1882 production, written by Dion Boucicault and J. R. Planche:  Early films were also a part of the entertainment, with Robert W. Paul, a former collaborator of Birt Acres, presenting his first theatrical programme on 25 March 1896. This included films featuring cartoonist Tom Merry drawing caricatures of the German Emperor Kaiser Wilhelm II (1895), and Prince Bismarck (1895). Merry had previously performed his lightning fast drawing as part of a music hall stage act.  During World War I, a series of hit revues played at the Alhambra that included The Bing Boys Are Here (1916), which featured the first performances of the song If You Were The Only Girl In The World, performed by Violet Lorraine and George Robey . This was followed by The Bing Boys on Broadway (1917) and The Bing Boys are There (1918).  The music for the revues was written by Nat D. Ayer with lyrics by Clifford Grey, and the text was by George Grossmith Jr.  Like many other theatres, the Alhambra went into decline after World War I owing to the increasing popularity of cinema and radio. It was demolished in 1936 to make way for the Odeon Leicester Square, which remains on the site. The entrance on Charing Cross Road has also been demolished and is now a modern office block.

It lives chiefly in shady woodlands, and grows up to  tall, producing a cluster of up to 18 pale blue flowers in spring. It was formally described in 1996, having previously been identified as belonging to the related species H.\u00a0italica.  Description Hyacinthoides paivae is a perennial plant which grows from bulbs that are typically  \u00d7 . Each bulb produces 4\u20137 (more rarely 2\u201312) basal leaves, each  long and  wide. The stems are  long, and bear an inflorescence comprising 6\u201318 flowers in a multilateral raceme. Each flower is attached by a pedicel  long, and is itself  long by  wide. H.\u00a0paivae can be told apart from H.\u00a0italica by its broader leaves and larger flowers; H.\u00a0hispanica differs in having longer, narrower, unscented and bell-shaped flowers.  Distribution and ecology Hyacinthoides paivae is endemic to the north-western part of the Iberian Peninsula, including western parts of Galicia (A Coru\u00f1a, Ourense and Pontevedra provinces) and north-western parts of Portugal (Beira Litoral, Douro Litoral, Minho and Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes provinces). Material of an unidentified species from the Sierra de la Demanda, a small mountain range on the border between Burgos province and La Rioja, matches H.\u00a0paivae genetically.  H.\u00a0paivae occurs in oak woodland and pine woods growing over Ulex, Erica cinerea and Cistus spp., as well as other shady habitats. It also occurs occasionally on coastal cliffs, and in mown meadows. The typical flowering period is March and April, although it can be as late as June in upland areas, such as Monte Pindo.  Taxonomic history In 1990, bluebells assigned to the species Hyacinthoides italica were reported from north-western Spain. Later analyses of the species morphology demonstrated that the plants did not belong to H.\u00a0italica, which is only otherwise found near the French\u2013Italian border. Instead, it was realised that they represented a new species, which was named Hyacinthoides paivae by Santiago Ortiz and Juan Rodr\u00edguez-Oubi\u00f1a in 1996, the specific epithet  honouring the Portuguese botanist Jorge Paiva.  The holotype, a specimen from Dumbr\u00eda, A Coru\u00f1a province, Spain, is held at the herbarium of the ; isotypes are also kept there, and at the University of Coimbra, the  and  in Madrid, the  in Pontevedra, and at the Natural History Museum and Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in London.  Ortiz and Rodr\u00edguez-Oubi\u00f1a initially placed the species in \"Hyacinthoides sect. Somera\", but more recent molecular phylogenetic analysis could not confirm any of the existing sections in the genus, and placed it instead in an informal group alongside H.\u00a0non-scripta, H.\u00a0hispanica and H.\u00a0cedretorum.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"William Cullen Bryant\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "William Cullen Bryant (November 3, 1794 \u2013 June 12, 1878) was an American romantic poet, journalist, and long-time editor of the New York Evening Post. Born in Massachusetts, he started his career as a lawyer but showed an interest in poetry early in his life. He soon relocated to New York and took up work as an editor at various newspapers. He became one of the most significant poets in early literary America and has been grouped among the fireside poets for his accessible, popular poetry.  Biography  Youth and education Bryant was born on November 3, 1794, in a log cabin near Cummington, Massachusetts; the home of his birth is today marked with a plaque. He was the second son of Peter Bryant (b. Aug. 12, 1767, d. Mar. 20, 1820), a doctor and later a state legislator, and Sarah Snell (b. Dec. 4, 1768, d. May 6, 1847). The genealogy of his mother traces back to passengers on the Mayflower: John Alden (b. 1599, d. 1687), his wife Priscilla Mullins and her parents William and Alice Mullins. The story of the romance between John and Priscilla is the subject of a famous narrative poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow The Courtship of Miles Standish.  He was also the nephew of Charity Bryant, a Vermont seamstress who is the subject of Rachel Hope Cleves's 2014 book Charity and Sylvia: A Same-Sex Marriage in Early America. William Cullen Bryant described their relationship: \"If I were permitted to draw the veil of private life, I would briefly give you the singular, and to me interesting, story of two maiden ladies who dwell in this valley. I would tell you how, in their youthful days, they took each other as companions for life, and how this union, no less sacred to them than the tie of marriage, has subsisted, in uninterrupted harmony, for more than forty years.\" Charity and Sylvia Drake are buried together at Weybridge Hill Cemetery, Weybridge, Vermont.  Bryant and his family moved to a new home when he was two years old. The William Cullen Bryant Homestead, his boyhood home, is now a museum. After just one year at Williams College (he entered with sophomore standing), he hoped to transfer to Yale, but a talk with his father led to the realization that family finances would not support it. His father counseled a legal career as his best available choice, and the disappointed poet began to study law in Worthington and Bridgewater in Massachusetts. He was admitted to the bar in 1815 and began practicing law in nearby Plainfield, walking the seven miles from Cummington every day. On one of these walks, in December 1815, he noticed a single bird flying on the horizon; the sight moved him enough to write \"To a Waterfowl\".  Bryant developed an interest in poetry early in life. Under his father's tutelage, he emulated Alexander Pope and other Neo-Classic British poets. \"The Embargo\", a savage attack on President Thomas Jefferson published in 1808, reflected Dr. Bryant's Federalist political views. The first edition quickly sold out\u2014partly because of publicity attached to the poet's young age. A second, expanded edition included Bryant's translation of classical verse. During his collegiate studies and his reading for the law, he wrote little poetry, but encounters with the Graveyard Poets and then Wordsworth regenerated his passion for \"the witchery of song.\"  Early poetry  \"Thanatopsis\" is Bryant's most famous poem, which Bryant may have been working on as early as 1811.  In 1817 his father took some pages of verse from his son's desk, and at the invitation of Willard Phillips, an editor of the North American Review who had previously been tutored in the classics by Dr. Bryant, he submitted them along with his own work. The editor of the Review, Edward Tyrrel Channing, read the poem to associate editor Richard Henry Dana Sr., who immediately exclaimed, \"That was never written on this side of the water!\" Someone at the North American joined two of the son's discrete fragments, gave the result the Greek-derived title Thanatopsis (\"meditation on death\"), mistakenly attributed it to the father, and published it. After clarification of the authorship, the son's poems began appearing with some regularity in the Review. A portion of Bryant\u2019s poem, Thanatopsis, is at the base of the William Cullen Bryant Memorial behind the New York Public Library which was dedicated in 1911. \"To a Waterfowl\", published in 1821, was the most popular.  On January 11, 1821, Bryant, still striving to build a legal career, married Frances Fairchild. Soon after, having received an invitation to address the Harvard University Phi Beta Kappa Society at the school's August commencement, Bryant spent months working on \"The Ages\", a panorama in verse of the history of civilization, culminating in the establishment of the United States. As it would in all collections he subsequently issued, \"The Ages\" led the volume, also entitled Poems, which he arranged to publish on the same trip to Cambridge. For that book, he added sets of lines at the beginning and end of \"Thanatopsis\" that changed the poem. His career as a poet was now established, though recognition as America's leading poet waited until 1832, when an expanded Poems was published in the U.S. and, with the assistance of Washington Irving, in Britain.  Editorial work From 1816 to 1825, Bryant depended on his law practice in Great Barrington, Massachusetts to sustain his family financially, but the strain of dealing with unsophisticated neighbors pushed him to trade his unrewarding profession for New York City and the promise of a literary career. With the encouragement of a distinguished and well-connected literary family, the Sedgwicks, he quickly gained a foothold in New York City's vibrant cultural life. His first employment, in 1825, was as editor of the New-York Review, which within the next year merged with the United States Review and Literary Gazette. Although literary historians have neglected his fiction, Bryant's stories over the seven-year period from his time with the Review to the publication of Tales of Glauber Spa in 1832 show a variety of strategies, making him the most inventive of practitioners of the genre during this early stage of its evolution.  In the throes of the failing struggle to raise subscriptions, he accepted part-time duties with the New-York Evening Post under William Coleman; then, partly because of Coleman's ill health, traceable to the consequences of a duel and then a stroke, Bryant's responsibilities expanded rapidly. From assistant editor he rose to editor-in-chief and co-owner of the newspaper that had been founded by Alexander Hamilton. Over the next half century, the Post would become the most respected paper in the city and, from the election of Andrew Jackson, the major platform in the Northeast for the Democratic Party and subsequently of the Free Soil and Republican Parties. In the process, the Evening-Post also became the pillar of a substantial fortune. Despite his Federalist beginnings, Bryant had shifted to being one of the most liberal voices of the century. An early supporter of organized labor, with his 1836 editorials asserting the right of workmen to strike, Bryant also defended religious minorities and immigrants, and promoted the abolition of slavery. He \"threw himself into the foreground of the battle for human rights\" and did not cease speaking out against the corrupting influence of certain bankers in spite of their efforts to break down the paper. According to newspaper historian Frank Luther Mott, Bryant was \"a great liberal seldom done justice by modern writers\".   He was elected an Associate Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1855.  Despite his once staunch opposition to Thomas Jefferson and his party, Bryant became one of the key supporters in the Northeast of that same party under Jackson. Bryant's views, always progressive though not quite populist, in course led him to join the Free Soilers, and when the Free Soil Party became a core of the new Republican Party in 1856, Bryant vigorously campaigned for John Fr\u00e9mont. That exertion enhanced his standing in party councils, and in 1860, he was one of the prime Eastern exponents of Abraham Lincoln, whom he introduced at Cooper Union. (That \"Cooper Union speech\" lifted Lincoln to the nomination, and then the presidency.) In the 1860 presidential election, he elected Lincoln and Hannibal Hamlin as a presidential elector.  Later years Bryant edited the very successful  Picturesque America, which was published between 1872 and 1874. This two-volume set was lavishly illustrated and described scenic places in the United States and Canada. In his last decade, Bryant shifted from writing his own poetry to a blank verse translation of Homer's works. He assiduously worked on the Iliad and The Odyssey from 1871 to 1874. He is also remembered as one of the principal authorities on homeopathy and as a hymnist for the Unitarian Church, both legacies of his father's influence on him.  In 1843, Bryant bought a house he christened Cedarmere (for the cedar trees around the pond, or \"mere\") in Roslyn Harbor, on Long Island.  In 1865, he bought the farmhouse in Cummington, where he'd grown up, and summered there annually until his death.  He made substantial improvements to the houses at both properties. He was known for his attention to trees on his land, and later in life he expressed concerns that deforestation in the United States would prove disastrous for American agriculture.  Bryant died in 1878 of complications from an accidental fall suffered after participating in a Central Park ceremony to honor Italian patriot Giuseppe Mazzini. He is buried at Roslyn Cemetery in Roslyn, New York.  Critical response  Bryant became one of the most significant poets in early American literary history. He is typically included among the group of poets referred to as the fireside poets, along with Longfellow, John Greenleaf Whittier, James Russell Lowell, and Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. They are considered to be among the first American poets whose popularity rivaled that of British poets, both at home and abroad and are so named because their writing was a source of entertainment for families gathered around the fire at home. Bryant's poetry has been described as being \"of a thoughtful, meditative character, and makes but slight appeal to the mass of readers.\"  Edgar Allan Poe praised Bryant and specifically the poem \"June\" in his essay \"The Poetic Principle\": The rhythmical flow, here, is even voluptuous\u2014nothing could be more melodious. The poem has always affected me in a remarkable manner. The intense melancholy which seems to well up, perforce, to the surface of all the poet's cheerful sayings about his grave, we find thrilling us to the soul\u2014while there is the truest poetic elevation in the thrill. The impression left is one of a pleasurable sadness.  Editor and children's writer Mary Mapes Dodge wrote that Bryant's poems \"have wrought vast and far-reaching good in the world.\" She predicted, \"You will admire more and more, as you grow older, the noble poems of this great and good man.\" Poet and literary critic Thomas Holley Chivers said that the \"only thing [Bryant] ever wrote that may be called Poetry is 'Thanatopsis', which he stole line for line from the Spanish. The fact is, that he never did anything but steal\u2014as nothing he ever wrote is original.\"  Bryant's poetry is tender and graceful, pervaded by a contemplative melancholy, and a love of solitude and the silence of the woods. Though he was brought up to admire Pope, and in his early youth imitated him, he was one of the first American poets to throw off his influence. Bryant had an interest in science and in geology especially. Thomas Cole was a friend and both, at different times, considered the \"geological structure\" of Volterra in Italy.  He met Charles Lyell in England in 1845.  As a writer, Bryant was an early advocate of American literary nationalism, and his own poetry focusing on nature as a metaphor for truth established a central pattern in the American literary tradition.  Some however, argue that a reassessment is long overdue. It finds great merit in a couple of short stories Bryant wrote while trying to build interest in periodicals he edited. More importantly, it perceives a poet of great technical sophistication who was a progenitor of Walt Whitman, to whom he was a mentor.  Legacy  Although born in and with deep family ties in New England, Bryant for most of his lifetime was thoroughly a New Yorker\u2014and a very dedicated one at that. He was a major force behind the idea that became Central Park, as well as a leading proponent of creating the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He was one of a group of founders of New York Medical College. He had close affinities with the Hudson River School of art and was an intimate friend of Thomas Cole. A statue of William Cullen Bryant was one of the statues of \u201cEminent Americans\u201d that surrounded the Palace of Fine Arts at the 1915 Panama Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco, California. The William Cullen Bryant Memorial, in Bryant Park, includes a bronze of the same work by sculptor Herbert Adams. Bryant Park, behind the New York Public Library, in New York bears his name. In 1884, New York City's Reservoir Square, at the intersection of 42nd Street and Sixth Avenue, was renamed Bryant Park, and later Herbert Adam's statue was placed, in Bryant's honor.   Just outside New York City, the Long Island village of Roslyn Harbor, New York is home to the William Cullen Bryant Preserve, located on land he formerly owned next to what is now the Nassau County Museum of Art. Bryant is also the namesake of the Bryant Library in Roslyn, New York, located near his Cedarmere Estate.  Other locations named after Bryant include: Bryant, a neighborhood in Seattle; Bryant Woods, one of the four original villages in Columbia, Maryland; Cullen Bryant Park in Toronto, Ontario; the Bryant Free Library in Cummington, Massachusetts; and the Bryant House at Williams College.  Several schools are named after Bryant, including William Cullen Bryant High School in Long Island City, New York, and elementary schools in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Long Beach, California, Cleveland, Ohio, and Great Barrington, Massachusetts. A rural schoolhouse in Sanford, Maine was also named for Bryant.  Martin Luther King Jr. quoted Bryant in his speech \"Give Us the Ballot\", when he said, \"there is something in this universe which justifies William Cullen Bryant in saying: 'Truth crushed to earth will rise again.

Located on a rocky ridge overlooking a loop of the Ourthe river, its origins go back to a Celtic oppidum.  History The castle was built on the ruins of a Celtic oppidum, on a site where human presence dates back to Neolithic times. The Romans later established a fortified camp there. In the early eighth century, Pepin Landen built a villa on the site.  The first castle was built in 844 (approximately) by Adelard, Count of La Roche. After the death of Henri de la Roche in 1152, the countship passed to Henri the Blind Count of Namur, and upon his death in 1196, to his daughter Ermesinde of Luxembourg and thus to the line of the counts of Luxembourg.  In the 14th century, the inhabitants of La Roche were authorized by Jean the Blind, count of Luxembourg, to protect their city by a wall and towers that strengthened the defensive system of the castle.  The strategic importance of the castle did not escape Louis XIV. From 1681 to 1688, he had a student of Vauban reinforce the structures. However, these improvements did not benefit him much since the castle was taken by the winners of the War of Succession of Spain and they neglected it little by little.  The misfortunes of the castle continued in 1721, when it was badly damaged by a fire caused by lightning. Joseph II of Austria then dismantled it. It was the prey of vandals in the nineteenth century, and it also was damaged in the bombing of December 1944 during the Battle of the Bulge.  Fortunately for history and architecture enthusiasts, the ruins of the castle of La Roche-en-Ardenne still constitute today a beautiful example of military architecture throughout the ages.

The castle stands on a rocky outcrop overlooking the town and the river Ourthe. The castle was built in the 11th century by the counts of Luxembourg. In 1437, it was acquired by the County of Burgundy. After the extinction of the county, it was inherited by the Kings of France. It was a French stronghold in the Middle Ages and was the scene of several battles during the Eighty Years' War and the Thirty Years' War. In the 19th century, the castle was restored and is now a tourist attraction. It also houses a folklore museum. The castle is located on a promontory overlooking the town of La Roche-en-Ardenne in the valley of the Ourthe river. The promontory is a rocky plateau measuring 1,600 by 500 metres (5,200 by 1,600 ft), with a height of up to 100 metres (330 ft) above the river. The castle has four corner towers and a rectangular keep in the centre. The keep is the oldest part of the castle, built in the 11th century. The walls were built in the 12th century. The towers and the porch were built in the 15th century. The keep is built on a square plan. The external walls are made of rough stone, while the inner walls are made of smooth stone. The upper part of the keep is made of wood. The keep has two floors. The lower floor has a kitchen, a dining room, and a living room. The upper floor has a chapel, a bedroom, and a hall. The castle is surrounded by a ditch and a curtain wall. The curtain wall has two gates, one facing the town and one facing the river. The castle has been restored several times in the 19th century. The restoration began in 1850 and was completed in 1890. The castle is now a tourist attraction and houses a folklore museum. In the 19th century, the keep was restored and the ditch was cleaned. In the 20th century, the curtain wall was restored and the towers were rebuilt. The folklore museum is located in the keep.

The peak is situated  northeast of McCarthy at Skolai Pass in Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve. Although modest in elevation, relief is significant as the south face rises 4,000 feet above the terminus of the Russell Glacier in less than one mile. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains east via the White River, and west to the Nizina River via Skolai Creek. The mountain's descriptive name was reported in 1914 by the United States Geological Survey.  Climate  Based on the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Castle Mountain is located in a subarctic climate zone with long, cold, snowy winters, and cool summers. Weather systems coming off the Gulf of Alaska are forced upwards by the Wrangell Mountains (orographic lift), causing heavy precipitation in the form of rainfall and snowfall. Temperatures can drop below \u221220 \u00b0F with wind chill factors below \u221230 \u00b0F. The months May through June offer the most favorable weather for viewing and climbing.

A strong, reliable, and tenacious left-back, who was effective in the air, he was known for his stamina and work-rate, which allowed him to contribute both offensively and defensively. A versatile player, although he was usually deployed along the left flank, he was also capable of playing on the right. His discipline in training ensured that he was rarely injured throughout his career. In addition to his footballing abilities, he was also known for his consistency, correct behaviour, and leadership.  Club career Born in Cosenza, Calabria, Pancaro started his youth career with Acri. He later moved to the Torino F.C. Youth squad remaining with the club for two seasons, before being loaned to Serie C2 club Avezzano. Pancaro made his professional debut with Cagliari Calcio, after the club's owner Massimo Cellino acquired him in 1992; although he only made 10 appearances during his first two seasons, he soon established himself as a key member of the starting line-up. In the 1993\u201394 UEFA Cup, Pancaro made his European debut, scoring the match winning goal in the first leg of the semi-final, after coming on as a substitute, as Cagliari beat eventual champions Inter 3\u20132.

He wrote on a wide range of subjects including mathematics, astronomy, medicine, physics, and philosophy. He was a friend and correspondent of Sir Isaac Newton and is best known for his work on the motion of the moon, on which he disputed the findings of Newton's Principia. He was the first to discover the crater Pancratium on the moon. Pancaro was born in Nocera Inferiore, a province of Salerno, in the Kingdom of Naples. He studied medicine and philosophy at the University of Naples, where he was a pupil of Giovanni Battista Porta, and subsequently worked as a physician in his native city. In 1702 he moved to Florence, where he lived for six years, devoting his energies to the study of mathematics and astronomy under the guidance of Antonio Maria Cassini. From 1708 to 1721 he was a professor of mathematics at the University of Parma, and during this period he made his home in Parma. In 1721 he returned to Naples, where he spent the rest of his life in the study of philosophy and science. Pancaro's lunar observations were made using a large refracting telescope, which he set up on the slopes of Vesuvius. His first observation of the moon's motion was made on 18 March 1705, and he continued to observe the moon for more than thirty years. He published the results of his observations in a book entitled Memorie di Stato del Moone e degli altri sistemi celesti, which appeared in three volumes between 1726 and 1739. In this work he presented his theories on the motion of the moon, and his explanation of various lunar phenomena, such as the appearance of spots on the moon and the rise of the waters of the sea in the moon's vicinity. He also discussed the motion of the sun and the planets, and the principles of mechanics and astronomy. In the first volume of his Memorie, Pancaro set out his theory of the moon's motion, according to which the moon's path around the earth is an epicycloid, with the earth at the center of the epicycloid and the moon at the inner focus of the epicycloid. This theory was in direct conflict with Newton's theory of the moon's motion, according to which the moon's path around the earth is a cycloid, with the earth at the center of the cycloid. Pancaro's theory was later shown to be incorrect when the moon was observed to be in the same position as the sun during an eclipse, which it would not be if its path were an epicycloid. In the second and third volumes of his Memorie, Pancaro discussed the principles of mechanics and astronomy, and the motion of the sun and the planets. In these volumes he presented his theory of the motion of the planets, according to which the planets move around the sun in elliptical orbits, with the sun at the center of the ellipses. This theory was in direct conflict with Newton's theory of the motion of the planets, according to which the planets move around the sun in circular orbits, with the sun at the center of the circles.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 4215588}

He was one of six children of a baker and a housewife. In 1928, he began to study at the School of Applied Arts in P\u0159erov, and then, in 1930, at the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague. His teachers included the painter and graphic artist Jaroslav Benda and the graphic artist and photographer Jaroslav Rossler. In addition to his studies, he worked as a photographer's assistant and as a painter of advertisements. In 1938, at the age of 24, Kalousek married his first wife, Anna, with whom he had one daughter, V\u011bra. In the same year, he joined the army and served in the military engineering corps.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Cinema of Tunisia\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The cinema of Tunisia began in 1896, when the Lumi\u00e8re brothers began showing animated films in the streets of Tunis.  History In 1919, the first feature-length movie produced in North Africa: Les Cinq gentlemen maudits (The Five Accursed Gentlemen) was filmed in Tunisia. In 1924, Samama-Chikli directed a medium-length film called Ain Al-Ghazal (The Girl from Carthage) thus making him, one of the first native filmmakers in North African. In 1966, the first feature Tunisian film (95 minutes) Al-Fajr (The Dawn) was directed and produced by Omar Khlifi; it was shot on a 35 mm film. Tunisia also hosts the Carthage Film Festival which has been taking place since 1966. The festival gives priority to films from Arab-speaking and African countries. It is the oldest film festival on the African continent.  In 1927, the first Tunisian film distribution company, Tunis-Film, started its activities. After independence, movies were exclusively produced by Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme Tunisienne de Production et d'Expansion Cin\u00e9matographique (SATPEC) which controlled cinema and filming productions in the country at the time. Nevertheless, during the 1980s, private production companies and studios emerged and wanted to make Tunisia the Mediterranean Hollywood. The producer Tarak Ben Ammar, a nephew of Wasila Bourguiba, succeeded in attracting some big production companies to shoot inside his studios in Monastir. Major foreign movies were filmed in Tunisia including Roman Polanski's Pirates and Franco Zeffirelli's Jesus of Nazareth. After visiting Tunisia George Lucas was seduced by the natural beauty and authentic old architecture of some Southern Tunisian towns where he decided to film important scenes of Star Wars, as well as Indiana Jones. Moreover, Anthony Minghella filmed the nine Academy Awards winner The English Patient in a south-west oasis of the country.  Domestic productions were rare: the few movies which were produced since 1967 tried to reflect the new social dynamics, development, identity research, and modernity shock. Some of them achieved relative success outside Tunisia, such as La Goulette (Halq El-Wadi 1996) directed by Ferid Boughedir which showed a flashback of typical community life in the small suburb of La Goulette in a period where Muslims, Jews and Christians lived together in tolerance and peace. Halfaouine: Child of the Terraces (Asfour Stah 1990), also by Boughedir, is possibly the biggest success in the history of Tunisian cinema. The movie showed the life of a child from the Halfaouine suburb of Tunis in the 60s, on a quest to understand relationships, the world of women, and how to be a man. In another earlier movie entitled Man of Ashes (Rih Essedd 1986) Boughedir again depicted Tunisian society without fear or favour, covering prostitution, paedophilia, and inter-faith relations between Tunisian Muslims and Tunisian Jews. In the 1991 film Bezness, he talked about the emerging sexual tourism inside the country. The Ambassadors (As-Soufraa 1975) directed by Naceur Ktari portrayed the life of immigrant Maghrebins in France and their struggle against racism. The film won the Golden Tanit for the best picture during the Carthage Film Festival in 1976, the special jury award from the Locarno International Film Festival in the same year and it has been classified in the Un Certain Regard category during the 1978 Cannes Film Festival.  The first Tunisian actress was Hayd\u00e9e Chikly, who starred in the short film, Zohra in 1922. The first feature film to be directed by a woman was Fatma 75 (1975) by Selma Baccar. Subsequent female directors films such as N\u00e9jia Ben Mabrouk's Sama (1988) and Moufida Tlatli's The Silences of Palace (1994).  In 2007, several films were produced and grabbed public attention, such as Making Of, directed by Nouri Bouzid and Nejib Belkadi's VHS Kahloucha.  In 2013, Abdellatif Kechiche was the first-ever Tunisian director to win the Palme D'Or award. For his film Blue Is the Warmest Colour he split the award with his two lead actresses.  On March 21, 2018, the country opened its first City of Culture, a project one of its kind in Africa and the Arab world , located in downtown Tunis. The complex contains several theaters, cinemas, screens, art and history galleries, exhibition halls, a contemporary and modern art museum, a national book centre and a cultural investment centre.   The first ever Cineplex in Tunisia opened in Tunis City mall in Tunis in December 2018, it consists of 8 screens and is operated by Les Cin\u00e9mas Gaumont Path\u00e9. Two other multiplexes are set to open by Les Cin\u00e9mas Gaumont Path\u00e9 in the coming years, one containing 8 screens at new Azur city mall in Banlieu Sud of Tunis and one of 6 screens in Sousse. Hotel chain La cigale announced in 2017, that it is building a hotel along with a mall and a multiplex of 10 screens in Gammarth, Banlieue Nord of Tunis and is set to open in 2020.  As of November 2019, there are 41 screens all across Tunisia.  Academy Award nominations  Tunisia has submitted films for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film on an irregular basis since 1995. The award is handed out annually by the United States Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-English dialogue. As of 2021, seven Tunisian films have been submitted for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film. The Man Who Sold His Skin was nominated for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film and was the first Tunisian film to be nominated for an Oscar.

The first feature film made in Tunisia was Le Fossile by Tunisian-French director Albert Cohen. Tunisia's film industry began to flourish in the early 20th century when the first Tunisian feature film, Le Fossile, was made. However, the country's promising film industry was halted for a while when Tunisia was under French colonial rule. In the early days of Tunisian cinema, the main filmmakers were French, and the film industry was run by the French. In Tunisia, there were two main groups: the Tunisians and the French. The Tunisians made films in Arabic, and the French made films in French. However, the number of Tunisian filmmakers increased over time. After Tunisia gained independence in 1956, the country's film industry began to flourish. The first Tunisian film to be made after independence was El Halia, directed by Ta\u00efeb Laraichi. In the 1960s, the Tunisian government began investing in the film industry. This led to the creation of the Carthage Film Festival, which is now one of the most important film festivals in the Arab world. The festival has been held every year since 1966 and is a showcase for Tunisian and Arab films. In the 1970s, the Tunisian film industry began to decline. This was due to a number of factors, including the rise of television, the decline of the Tunisian film market, and the lack of government support for the film industry. However, in the 1980s, the Tunisian film industry began to recover. This was due to the efforts of a new generation of Tunisian filmmakers, such as Nouri Bouzid and Rachid Mimouni. In the 1990s, the Tunisian film industry began to flourish again. This was due to the growth of the Tunisian film market and the increasing number of Tunisian films being made. In the 2000s, the Tunisian film industry continued to grow, and the number of Tunisian films being made increased. In recent years, the Tunisian film industry has been growing steadily. This is due to the efforts of the Tunisian government to support the film industry and the increasing number of Tunisian films being made.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 24243823}

Holy Mass was celebrated by Pope Francis before political and religious leaders from around the world. The crowd was estimated between 150,000 and 200,000. Official delegations from 132 states and various religious groups attended. It was the first papal inauguration attended by the Patriarch of Constantinople in over 1,000 years.  Ceremony   About half an hour before the Mass, Francis toured the square in the popemobile to greet the crowds. He stopped and left the popemobile once to kiss a disabled man. Pope Francis wore a simple mitre, which he has had since he was bishop, as well as its matching chasuble. He used the pastoral staff that Benedict XVI used, but in contrast to Benedict XVI's grand liturgical sense, Pope Francis kept the songs and liturgical actions simple. According to Cardinal Timothy Dolan, Pope Francis's lack of singing during Mass is attributed to him having only one lung.  After the Pope's arrival, the ceremony began with the new Pope descending to the tomb of St. Peter in St. Peter's Basilica.  The pope, along with the Patriarchs and Major-Archbishops of the Eastern Catholic Churches prayed at the tomb. Afterwards, the pallium\u2014a lamb's wool shawl\u2014and the Ring of the Fisherman were taken by two deacons from the tomb where they had previously been laid and carried up to be borne in procession. Then the pope and the Eastern Catholic Patriarchs and Major-Archbishops went up to the Basilica main floor and proceeded along with the other cardinals, bishops and other clergy in procession to the square chanting the \"Laudes Regi\u00e6\".  The cardinal protodeacon, Cardinal Jean-Louis Tauran, bestowed the pallium on the Pope. The senior cardinal-priest present Godfried Danneels read the prayer for the new pope before the Ring of the Fisherman was presented.  Angelo Sodano, Dean of the College of Cardinals, presented him with his Fisherman's Ring of gold-plated silver unlike his predecessors' which were gold. Six cardinals, two of each rank of cardinal, then professed their obedience to Pope Francis on behalf of the College of Cardinals. In previous ceremonies, all the cardinals did so.  According to a Vatican spokesperson between 150,000 and 200,000 people attended.  Homily  Pope Francis delivered his homily in Italian. He focused on the Solemnity of Saint Joseph, the liturgical day on which the Mass was celebrated. He stated that everyone needs to care for the earth and for each other as Joseph cared for Jesus and Mary. He set forth a plan of his own actions: \"The pope, too, when exercising power, must enter ever more fully into that service, which has its radiant culmination on the cross.\"  Official delegations   Some 132 states and international organizations sent delegations to the inauguration. The delegations included 6 sovereign rulers, 31 heads of state, 3 princes, and 11 heads of government.  States  Taiwan's representation was opposed by China, which has asked the Vatican to end the diplomatic relations with the state.  Others  Religious figures  Christian churches  The Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople had not attended a papal inauguration since the Great Schism of 1054. Orthodox leaders said that the decision of Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople to attend showed that he considers the relationship between the Orthodox and Catholic churches a priority. They also noted that Francis' \"well-documented work for social justice and his insistence that globalization is detrimental to the poor\" may have created a \"renewed opportunity\" for the two church communities to \"work collectively on issues of mutual concern.\"  Other religions  Notes  References  External links    Pope Francis inauguration: as it happened  Pope Francis 2013 in Italy 2013 in Christianity", "machine_text": " Papal inauguration of Pope Francis The papal inauguration of Francis took place on 13 March 2013 in St. Peter's Square. While previous papal inaugurations had been held in St. Peter's Square, the inauguration of Francis was the first to be held in the adjacent elliptical space, in front of the newly built Meta Sudio. The ceremony was attended by more than 150,000 people, who filled the square and the nearby streets. The number of attendees was surprising, given that the event was not well publicised. The Vatican had not arranged for the event to be shown live on television, and the local police had not expected such a large crowd. The ceremony began at 13:00 local time. In a break from tradition, Francis was not crowned with the tiara. After being presented with the pallium and the Ring of the Fisherman, he moved through the crowd to pray before the statue of Saint Peter, above which he had been elected. The ceremony ended with the singing of the \"Regina Caeli\". On the morning of 13 March 2013, Francis had breakfast with the cardinals who had elected him. He then received the congratulations of the diplomatic corps and was introduced to the office staff of the Holy See. In the afternoon, he met with the Curia, the dicasteries of the Roman Curia and the managers of the Vatican City State. In addition to the cardinals who had participated in the conclave, the inauguration was attended by more than 120 foreign delegations, including government officials from Argentina, Iraq, Japan, the United States and Venezuela, as well as from the European Union and the United Nations. The Israeli and Palestinian delegations were seated beside each other. The event was the first since the formation of the Kingdom of Italy in 1870 that a pope had been installed in the Vatican City.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Sinan Pasha Mosque (Prizren)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Sinan Pasha Mosque (; ; ; ) is an Ottoman mosque in the city of Prizren, Kosovo. It was built in 1615 by Sofi Sinan Pasha, bey of Budim. The mosque overlooks the main street of Prizren and is a dominant feature in the town's skyline.  Sinan Pasha Mosque was declared a Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance in 1990 by the Republic of Serbia.  History   Sofi Sinan Pasha started construction of the mosque in either 1600 or 1608. Sofi Sinan Pasha, an Albanian and former beylerbey and kaymakam in Bosnia should not be confused with grand vizier Sinan Pasha, who built the Sinan Pasha Mosque in the nearby city of Ka\u010danik.  It is widely considered that the stones used to build the mosque were taken from nearby Saint Archangels Monastery, a Serbian Orthodox monastery founded by Serbian Emperor Stefan Du\u0161an. In fact, parts of the former monastery can be seen in the mosque. The monastery, which was abandoned after the arrival of the Ottomans in the 16th century, had fallen to ruins by the 17th century. Hasan Kaleshi, an Albanian historian, sustained in 1972 that Sofi Sinan Pasha couldn't have possibly ordered any monastery destruction as this was impossible without a Sultan decree, rather, he ordered the use of the spare stones to a better deed as ordered by the Sultan.  Description   The mosque covers roughly  by  and is square in shape. It has one large dome and another smaller half-dome that covers the mihrab, which is painted and has a stalactite hood. The mosque's walls are  thick and its minaret, which is topped by a conical structure covered by lead, is  in height.  The walls and dome inside Sinan Pasha Mosque were painted in the 19th century, mostly of floral patterns and Qur'an verses. The minbar is painted with floral motives. Both the large dome and the half-dome of the mosque are covered with lead. The stone flooring of the mosque and the carpentry are original.  Preservation concerns  Rain, which over time has entered the mosque via holes in the roof, has caused the loss of some original paintings on the walls and has led to the detachment of some of the wall plaster. Stones of the fa\u00e7ade have faced weathering.  Abdullah G\u00ebrguri worked on a series of repairs of the murals, particularly in the 1970s.  In early 2000 the cost to rehabilitate the building was estimated at about \u20ac500,000 by UNESCO.  Manuscripts and use of building controversy  The Prizren municipality intended to build a library within the mosque in order to preserve not only the original Ottoman manuscripts found in the mosque, but also other valuable ones that can be found all over Kosovo. However, the Islamic Union of Kosovo filed a lawsuit against the Prizren Municipality in order to not allow the mosque to become a museum, but instead to have it continue to be a religious building.

Childhood and education Van Praag was the son of Esther Van Praag and diamond cutter Louis (Levi) van Praag. The family was Jewish but not religious. The family moved to Antwerp, where Van Praag attended elementary and high school.  In 1931 the family Van Praag was again registered in Amsterdam, and Henri attended the five-year course at the municipal training college (diploma 1936), where he met Leny van Huystee, whom he married in 1947. In 1938 he received his certificate of competency as headmaster, and  in 1939 a teaching certificate in French. At this time his interest in mysticism led him to read Chinese sage Li, a Jewish mystic whose name he never mentioned, the theologian J. Eykman (1892-1945) and the philosopher-physicist-educator Dr Philip Kohnstamm (1875-1951). He also had a practice as a psychologist and psychotherapist.  Van Praag spent World War II in hiding, in Amsterdam and other places. Many of his relatives were deported to concentration camps, where more than seventy relatives were murdered. Leny maintained contact with him during this period.  Post-war career After the war, Van Praag wanted to work for peace, and \"turned [...] to people across all boundaries of religion, or national cultures. He exchanged as any other information from Judaism to Buddhism, of Taoism to gnosticism, from theology to science.  After obtaining the deed Dutch Language and Literature for secondary education (1946), he began an eagerness for several university studies: general philosophy of science, physics and pedagogy (Kohnstamm), logic (Evert Willem Beth), mathematics (L.E.J. Brouwer), biology (Heimans), sociology (Mennicken), economics (Mermans), general linguistics (Marcel Cohen), history (Jacques Presser), Judaica (Joseph B. Soloveitchik), psychology (Otto Selz) and phenomenology of religion and cultural anthropology (Gerard van der Leeuw).  Meanwhile, he was heavily involved with the Jews returning from the camps, especially in children. He conducted research for the Institute for the Tropics. His first, not in book form, study number, time and space, (1949) deals with the psychological foundations of mathematics and physics. His first book, The Meaning of Education (1950), was devoted to education and ends with a passionate creed. He did bachelor's degree in 1950, Master's degree in 1951. Under the pseudonym Bernard Raimond, he published a novel in the style of mystical Meyrink, is waiting for you (1953), a document that attests to his deep interest in and knowledge of China, the Jewish mysticism and reincarnation.  Shortly after the war in 1946 Van Praag was director of teaching HBS (Aid Study). Hammelburg related to the pedagogic Social Work community, working at the Dutch Institute for Psychological Research in Hilversum. In 1949 he took part in the tenth congress of philosophy in Paris. In 1951, Van Praag pedagogical consultant at the Institute of his teacher Kohnstamm, the General Social Consulting.  At an international conference in 1952 the World Organization for Mutual Understanding and Co-operation (WOMUC) set up and Henri became chairman. Van Praag included Otto Frank, Anne Frank's father, Zvi Werblowsky and Karl Thieme. One of the initiatives that emerged from the conference was the plan for a three-part series Das Lebendige Gottes Wort, an anthology with commentary from Jewish and Christian writings on revelation, prayer and promise. Many scholars, including Martin Buber, had agreed to cooperate, Thieme and Van Praag would lead. The plan was not implemented in this form by the sudden death of Thieme and the departure of Van Praag to Montevideo.  Intermezzo Uruguay (1953-1954)  Intermezzo Uruguay (1953-1954) in early 1950, the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin to anti-Semitism. Van Praag in 1953 went to Uruguay to investigate whether this country a new home for Jewish children could be. He was visiting Montevideo in psychology, pedagogy and philosophy, while he also had a practice as a psychologist-therapist. All his life he would also like therapist (counselor) for fellows remain available, people who were on something or had a question, could always go to him for an interview or an opinion. He then listened to the other, conducted an interview and ended with this advice.  He also studied Chinese language and culture in Montevideo with Professor Li Yu-Ying (Li Shizeng), former Rector of the Imperial University of Peking. With Stalin's death and the arrival of Nikita Khrushchev in 1953 compared the situation for Jews in Russia to improve, so the mission had formed the reason for the trip to South America was halted.  In the center of society (1954-1973)  In the center of society was founded in 1954 with his brother Henry I. (Dorus) van Praag and I.J. Sloos, and was aimed at improving the dialogue between Jews and Christians. With Jacob Soetendorp he worked on the series Phoenix Bible Paperbacks. Soetendorp translated large parts of the Old Testament again from Hebrew into Dutch, inspired by the new German translation of Martin Buber and Franz Rosenzweig. Van Praag had to finalize the 18 parts of Hebrew Bible, J. Goudoever of the final editing of the 12 parts of the New Testament. Van Praag also wrote the entire series of some forty articles and introductory and linking between texts and other items were the result of numerous conversations between Protestant and Catholic Christians, Jews and - to a lesser extent - Muslims.  Van Praag was also active in many areas. He was appointed in 1957 as a teacher at the local training college in 4 hours per week in pedagogy and in the same year was appointed professor at the LOI (Pelman Institute). In 1958 he became director of the Center for pedagogic Psychology in Amsterdam, in 1964 he was consultant and from 1966 senior lecturer of Teleac (a relationship that until 1977 would last), (main) editor for various publishers and magazines including Studium Generale, Effective Business Management and Intermediate.

He was also rector of the Academy of Religion Vergleichende Geschichte in Duisburg (Germany), where he also taught religious studies.  In 1975 he founded the magazine Prana (magazine for spirituality and the periphery of science, publishing Ankh-Hermes) on.

Tenhaeff as professor of parapsychology at the University of Utrecht, a position he held until 1986 would continue to play. Van Praag highlights in this field, that psychology should be seen as a border area of what is called parapsychology, as Einstein defined as a straight line curve with a degree of curvature = 0.

Born in The Hague, the Netherlands, van Praag was the son of a physician and a musician. He studied chemistry at the University of Amsterdam, where he received his Ph.D. in 1938. He joined the Dutch firm Royal Dutch Shell that year, working in Amsterdam and London before moving to Cura\u00e7ao, in the Caribbean, in 1940. There, he met his future wife, Nelly, a native of Cura\u00e7ao. In 1942, he joined the U.S. War effort as a scientist, working on the development of synthetic rubber at the Rubber Development Corporation in Washington, D.C. After the war, van Praag returned to the Netherlands, where he became head of the Laboratory for Physical Chemistry at the University of Amsterdam. In 1948, together with the Swedish chemist Carl Djerassi, he was the first to report the solid state thermal decomposition of benzil to form benzene. In 1949, he was appointed professor of physical chemistry at the University of Leiden, a position he held until his retirement in 1979. His research focused on the kinetics of chemical reactions, especially those involving free radicals. In 1951, he was the first to discover the hydrogen abstraction reaction of the title compound, dilauryl peroxide. In 1950, van Praag became a corresponding member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, and he was elected a full member in 1979. In addition, he was a member of the Dutch Society for Chemistry and Physics, the American Chemical Society, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and the Royal Society of Edinburgh. After retiring from his academic career, van Praag returned to the business world as a consultant in the area of intellectual property management. He was a co-founder of the Chemists' Club, a business networking organization, and served as its first chairman. In 1979, he became a founding member of the World Business Network, an international business networking organization, and served as its first vice-president. In 1980, he became a member of the advisory board of the American Chemical Society's Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Division. In 1981, van Praag was awarded the Carl Djerassi Award for Outstanding Achievement in Physical Organic Chemistry. In 1983, he received the International Society for Intellectual Property Management's IPM Award. In 1983, van Praag and his wife established the Henri and Nelly van Praag Foundation, a private charitable foundation whose mission is to promote the understanding of chemistry and its impact on society. The Foundation provides grants to researchers and teachers in the chemical sciences, and to nonprofit organizations that promote the understanding of chemistry. In addition, the Foundation sponsors the annual Henri van Praag Lecture in Physical Organic Chemistry at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and the annual Nelly van Praag Lecture in Chemistry at the University of Puerto Rico, Mayag\u00fcez. In 2008, van Praag turned 100. He died at his home in Illinois in 2016, at the age of 102.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 30839078}

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, pop music was in a state of transition. The first generation of rock and roll stars were growing old, and a new breed of younger performers were starting to achieve stardom. The first wave of British Invasion acts, led by the Beatles, had already changed the face of popular music, and the second wave of British acts, led by the Rolling Stones, were starting to make their mark. At the same time, the early days of electronic music were producing a new sound, which was just beginning to make its way into popular music. The first electronic instruments, such as the therevox and the electric organ, were just starting to become popular, and the first electronic music composers, such as Karlheinz Stockhausen, were just starting to make their mark. The result was a period of experimentation and exploration, as musicians tried to find a new sound that would define the era. Flexipop was a result of this search. It was a fusion of pop and electronic music, designed to be played in discoth\u00e8ques, or dance halls. The music was usually upbeat and had a strong beat, designed to get people dancing. It was also usually associated with drugs, particularly MDMA (3,4-Methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine, or \"ecstasy\"). The combination of the upbeat music and the drug induced euphoria often created a feeling of unity and togetherness, and the music became a central part of the discoth\u00e8que culture. The first flexipop acts were primarily European, and included acts such as the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, the Kinks, the Who, the Small Faces, the Doors, and the Seeds. However, as the genre grew, it began to include acts from other parts of the world, such as the United States, Australia, and Japan. Some of the more well-known acts from outside Europe include the Beach Boys, the Byrds, the Who, the Small Faces, the Kinks, the Doors, the Seeds, the Who, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and the Monkees. The flexipop era lasted from the late 1960s until the early 1970s, and was a major part of the discoth\u00e8que culture of the era. However, as the 1970s progressed, the genre began to be replaced by a new form of electronic music, known as disco. Disco was a more commercial form of electronic music, and was designed to be played in a wider range of settings, such as clubs, parties, and radio. As a result, flexipop began to be seen as a more niche genre, and the number of new acts began to decline.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 13099381}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Hurricane Harvey\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Hurricane Harvey was a devastating Category\u00a04 hurricane that made landfall on Texas and Louisiana in August\u00a02017, causing catastrophic flooding and more than 100 deaths. It is tied with 2005's Hurricane Katrina as the costliest tropical cyclone on record, inflicting $125\u00a0billion (2017 USD) in damage, primarily from catastrophic rainfall-triggered flooding in the Houston metropolitan area and Southeast Texas; this made the storm the costliest natural disaster recorded in Texas at the time. It was the first major hurricane to make landfall in the United States since Wilma in 2005, ending a record 12-year span in which no hurricanes made landfall at the intensity of a major hurricane throughout the country. In a four-day period, many areas received more than  of rain as the system slowly meandered over eastern Texas and adjacent waters, causing unprecedented flooding. With peak accumulations of , in Nederland, Texas, Harvey was the wettest tropical cyclone on record in the United States. The resulting floods inundated hundreds of thousands of homes, which displaced more than 30,000\u00a0people and prompted more than 17,000\u00a0rescues.  The eighth named storm, third hurricane, and first major hurricane of the extremely active 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, Harvey developed from a tropical wave to the east of the Lesser Antilles, reaching tropical storm status on August\u00a017. The storm crossed through the Windward Islands on the following day, making landfall on the southern end of Barbados and a second landfall on Saint Vincent. Upon entering the Caribbean, Harvey began to weaken due to moderate wind shear, and degenerated into a tropical wave north of Colombia, late on August\u00a019. The remnants were monitored for regeneration as it continued west-northwestward across the Caribbean and the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, before redeveloping over the Bay of Campeche on August\u00a023. Harvey then began to rapidly intensify on August\u00a024, regaining tropical storm status and becoming a hurricane later that day.  While the storm moved generally northwest, Harvey's intensification phase stalled slightly overnight from August\u00a024\u201325; however, Harvey soon resumed strengthening and quickly became a major hurricane, attaining Category\u00a04 intensity later that day with peak 1-minute sustained winds of 130 mph. Hours later, Harvey made landfall at San Jos\u00e9 Island, Texas, at peak intensity, followed by another landfall at Holiday Beach at Category 3 intensity. Rapid weakening then ensued, and Harvey had downgraded to a tropical storm as it stalled near the coastline, dropping torrential and unprecedented amounts of rainfall over Texas. On August\u00a028, the storm emerged back over the Gulf of Mexico, strengthening slightly before making a fifth and final landfall in Louisiana on August\u00a029. As Harvey drifted inland, it quickly weakened again as it became extratropical on September\u00a01, before dissipating two days later.  In addition to the huge cost and extent of the damage it caused, Harvey caused at least 107 confirmed deaths: 1 in Guyana and 106 in the United States, the first one in Rockport, Texas. Due to the extensive damage, the name \"Harvey\" was retired in April 2018 and will not be used for another Atlantic tropical cyclone. It was replaced with \"Harold\" for the 2023 hurricane season.  Meteorological history  Hurricane Harvey originated from a westward-moving tropical wave that emerged from Africa over the eastern Atlantic Ocean, on August\u00a012. A surface circulation slowly developed and convection consolidated around the low over the subsequent days; the system became a tropical depression on August\u00a017, roughly  east of Barbados. Maintaining its brisk westward motion, the system strengthened slightly and became a tropical storm later that day, at which time it was assigned the name Harvey. With maximum sustained winds of , Harvey made landfalls in Barbados and St. Vincent on August\u00a018 before entering the Caribbean. Hostile environmental conditions, namely wind shear, imparted weakening and caused Harvey to degenerate into a tropical wave by August\u00a019. Though it lacked an organized surface low, the remnants of Harvey continued to produce significant convection as it traversed the Caribbean Sea and Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. The system reached the Bay of Campeche in the Gulf of Mexico on August\u00a023 and soon consolidated around a new surface low.  Late on August\u00a023, the remnants of Harvey regenerated into a tropical cyclone and re-attained tropical storm intensity by 18:00\u00a0UTC. Initial reorganization was slow; however, within a highly favorable environment, the system soon underwent rapid intensification as an eye developed and its central pressure quickly fell. After becoming a hurricane on August\u00a024, Harvey continued to quickly strengthen over the next day, ultimately reaching peak intensity as a Category\u00a04 hurricane. Around 03:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a026, the hurricane made landfall at peak intensity on San Jose Island, just east of Rockport, with winds of  and an atmospheric pressure of . It made a second landfall on the Texas mainland, at Rockport, three hours later in a slightly weakened state. Harvey became the first major hurricane to make landfall in the United States since Wilma in 2005.  Once Harvey moved inland, it began to rapidly weaken as its speed slowed dramatically to a crawl, and Harvey weakened to a tropical storm on August\u00a026. For about two days the storm stalled just inland, dropping very heavy rainfall and causing catastrophic flash flooding. Harvey's center drifted back towards the southeast, ultimately re-emerging into the Gulf of Mexico on August\u00a028. Once offshore, the poorly organized system struggled against strong wind shear. Deep convection persisted north of the cyclone's center near the Houston metropolitan area along a stationary front, resulting in several days of record-breaking rain. Early on August\u00a030, the former hurricane made its fifth and final landfall just west of Cameron, Louisiana with winds of . Associated convection with Harvey became focused north of the center and along a warm front on September\u00a01 as it moved further inland, indicating that the system transitioned into a post-tropical cyclone by 06:00\u00a0UTC that day. The remnants continued northeastwards before being absorbed into another extratropical system on September\u00a03.  Preparations  Caribbean and Latin America  Tropical cyclone warnings and watches for the Windward Islands were issued starting at 15:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a017, about six hours before Harvey developed. At that time, a tropical storm watch was posted for Dominica, while a tropical storm warning became in effect in Barbados, Martinique, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. All watches and warnings were discontinued by late on August\u00a018, as the storm continued westward into the Caribbean.  In Honduras, a green alert was issued for the Atl\u00e1ntida, Islas de la Bah\u00eda, Col\u00f3n, Cort\u00e9s, Gracias a Dios, Olancho, and Yoro departments. About  of precipitation was expected along the coast, while inland areas were forecast to receive  of rain. As the remnants of Harvey approached Mexico, the Civil Protection Secretary of the state of Campeche issued a blue alert, indicating minimal danger. When Harvey redeveloped at 15:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a023, the Government of Mexico issued a tropical storm watch in Tamaulipas from Boca De Catan to the mouth of the Rio Grande. The watch remained in effect until 21:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a025, after it became evident that the storm no longer posed a significant threat to that area.  United States  FEMA worked with the Coast Guard, Customs and Border Protection, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement to prepare for the storm and its aftermath. The agency placed disaster response teams on standby at emergency posts in Austin, Texas, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana.  Texas  Upon the NHC resuming advisories for Harvey at 15:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a023, a hurricane watch was issued in Texas from Port Mansfield to San Luis Pass, while a tropical storm watch was posted from Port Mansfield south to the mouth of the Rio Grande and from San Luis Pass to High Island. Additionally, a storm surge watch became in effect from Port Mansfield to High Island. Additional watches and warnings were posted in these areas at 09:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a024, with a hurricane warning from Port Mansfield to Matagorda; a tropical storm warning from Matagorda to High Island; a hurricane watch and tropical storm warning from Port Mansfield to the Rio Grande; a storm surge warning from Port Mansfield to San Luis Pass; and a storm surge watch from Port Mansfield to the Rio Grande. As the hurricane neared landfall on August\u00a024, an extreme wind warning\u2014indicating an immediate threat of 115\u2013145\u00a0mph (185\u2013235\u00a0km/h) winds\u2014was issued for areas expected to be impacted by the eyewall; this included parts of Aransas, Calhoun, Nueces, Refugio, and San Patricio counties. The watches and warnings were adjusted accordingly after Harvey moved inland and began weakening, with the warning discontinued at 15:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a026. By 09:00\u00a0UTC on the following day, only a tropical storm warning and a storm surge warning remained in effect from Port O'Connor to Sargent. However, watches and warnings were re-issued as Harvey began to re-emerge into the Gulf of Mexico, and beginning at 15:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a028, a tropical storm warning was in effect for the entire Gulf Coast of Texas from High Island northward.  Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of emergency for 30\u00a0counties on August\u00a023, while mandatory evacuations were issued for Brazoria, Calhoun, Jackson, Refugio, San Patricio, and Victoria counties, as well as parts of Matagorda County. On August\u00a026, Governor Abbott added an additional 20\u00a0counties to the state of emergency declaration. Furthermore, the International Charter on Space and Major Disasters was activated by the USGS on behalf of the Governor's Texas Emergency Management Council, including the Texas Division of Emergency Management, thus providing for humanitarian satellite coverage.  Louisiana In Louisiana, Governor John Bel Edwards declared a state of emergency for the entire state. A mandatory evacuation was ordered in Cameron Parish for the cities of Big Lake, Cameron, Creole, Grand Chenier, Hackberry, Holly Beach, and Johnson Bayou. Additionally, a voluntary evacuation was ordered in Vermilion Parish for low-lying areas south of State Highway 14. The Louisiana National Guard prepared about 500,000\u00a0sandbags and emergency boats and high-water-rescue vehicles were placed on standby should flooding occur. In New Orleans, there were concerns about whether or not the city's drainage system could handle a heavy rainfall event, with only 105\u00a0of the 120\u00a0water pumps being operational and some power turbines being out of service. The city's public schools, as well as six universities and a medical school, closed on August 29. As Harvey began re-emerging into the Gulf of Mexico on August\u00a028, the tropical storm warning in Texas from Mesquite Bay to High Island was extended eastward into Louisiana to the community of Cameron at 12:00\u00a0UTC, while a tropical storm watch was issued from Cameron to Intracoastal City.  Video briefings by officials  Impacts in the Caribbean and Latin America Winds left residents throughout Barbados without electricity, with a majority of outages occurring in Christ Church, Saint Joseph, Saint Lucy, and Saint Michael provinces. Flooding washed one house off its foundation, while water entered some houses, forcing some people to evacuate. Bridges in Saint Andrew and Saint Joseph were damaged. Additionally, a fuel depot in Speightstown was flooded. Winds from Harvey ripped the roof off a church. In Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, nine homes were flooded and four others experienced wind damage. Also, a tree fell on a school, damaging the building. Blocked drains in Port Elizabeth resulted in more than 15\u00a0businesses being flooded. A total of 15\u00a0people were housed in shelters after the storm.  Strong winds and heavy rainfall also affected Suriname and Guyana. In the former, high winds in the capital city of Paramaribo caused roof damage to the Presidential Palace and two homes, while the Torarica Hotel and Casino suffered structural impact. Additionally, four dwellings were deroofed in Commewijne and three others lost their roofs in Wanica; in the latter, the Ministry of Social Affairs building was damaged by falling trees. In Guyana, the village of Jawalla bore the brunt of the storm. Four homes were demolished, while five other residences and two shops were damaged. Several public buildings were also damaged, including the community center, the village council buildings, the nursery, and public schools. A 29-year-old woman died after her house collapsed on her.  Impacts in the United States  The widespread and catastrophic effects of Hurricane Harvey resulted in one of the costliest natural disasters in United States history. An estimated 300,000\u00a0structures and 500,000\u00a0vehicles were damaged or destroyed in Texas alone. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimated total damage at $125\u00a0billion, with a 90% confidence interval of $90\u2013160\u00a0billion. The scope of flooding in areas with low National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) participation lends to the large uncertainty in the damage total. This ranks Harvey as the costliest tropical cyclone on record in the country alongside Hurricane Katrina in 2005. However, accounting for inflation and cost increases since 2005, the National Hurricane Center considers Harvey the second-costliest. Harvey was the costliest natural disaster recorded in Texas at the time, until it was surpassed in February 2021 by a severe winter storm that crippled the state's power grid, which was estimated to have cost at least $195 billion (2021 USD) in damages in Texas. Nationwide, 107\u00a0people died in storm-related incidents: 103 in Texas, 2 in Arkansas, 1 in Tennessee, and 1 in Kentucky. Of the deaths in Texas, 68 were from the direct effects of Harvey, the highest such number in the state since 1919.  Texas  Throughout Texas, approximately 336,000\u00a0people were left without electricity and tens of thousands required rescue. Throughout the state, 103\u00a0people died in storm-related incidents: 68 from its direct effects, including flooding, and 35 from indirect effects in the hurricane's aftermath. By August\u00a029, 2017 approximately 13,000\u00a0people had been rescued across the state while an estimated 30,000 were displaced. The refinery industry capacity was reduced, and oil and gas production was affected in the Gulf of Mexico and inland Texas. On Monday, the closure of oil refineries ahead of Hurricane Harvey created a fuel shortage. Panicked motorists waited in long lines. Consequently, gas stations through the state were forced to close due to the rush. More than 20 percent of refining capacity was affected.    More than 48,700 homes were affected by Harvey throughout the state, including over 1,000 that were completely destroyed and more than 17,000 that sustained major damage; approximately 32,000 sustained minor damage. Nearly 700 businesses were damaged as well. Yet the Texas Department of Public Safety stated more than 185,000 homes were damaged and 9,000 destroyed.  The hurricane also caused many people to believe that in the wild, only 10 individuals of Attwater's prairie chicken remained at most until Spring 2018, when it was discovered that there were about a dozen wild individuals left.  Landfall area  Making landfall as a Category\u00a04 hurricane, Harvey inflicted tremendous damage across Aransas County. Wind gusts were observed up to  near Port Aransas. Nearly every structure in Port Aransas was damaged, some severely, while significant damage from storm surge also occurred. In Rockport, entire blocks were destroyed by the hurricane's violent eyewall winds. The city's courthouse was severely damaged when a cargo trailer was hurled into it, coming to a stop halfway through the structure. The gymnasium of the Rockport-Fulton High School lost multiple walls while the school itself suffered considerable damage. Many homes, apartment buildings, and businesses sustained major structural damage from the intense winds, and several were completely destroyed. Numerous boats were damaged or sunk at a marina in town, airplanes and structures were destroyed at the Aransas County Airport, and a Fairfield Inn in the city was severely damaged as well. About 20 percent of Rockport's population was displaced, and they were still unable to return to their homes a year after the hurricane. The first death associated with Harvey was in Rockport, caused by a house fire, the city was unable to rescue the victim due to the extreme weather conditions. Just north of Rockport, many structures were also severely damaged in the nearby town of Fulton. In the small community of Holiday Beach, catastrophic damage occurred as almost every home in town was severely damaged or destroyed by storm surge and violent winds. By the afternoon of August\u00a026, more than  of rain had fallen in the Corpus Christi metropolitan area. All of Victoria was left without water and most had no power.  Houston metropolitan area flooding  Many locations in the Houston metropolitan area observed at least  of precipitation, with a maximum of  in Nederland. This makes Harvey the wettest tropical cyclone on record for both Texas and the United States, surpassing the previous rainfall record held by Tropical Storm Amelia. The local National Weather Service office in Houston observed all-time record daily rainfall accumulations on both August\u00a026 and 27, measured at  and  respectively. Due to the amount of rain accumulated from Harvey, the National Weather Service added 2 new colors to the rain index representing around 50% of the maximum rainfall dropped by Harvey. Multiple flash flood emergencies were issued in the Houston area by the National Weather Service beginning the night of August 26. In Pearland, a suburb south of Houston, a report was made of 9.92\" of rainfall in 90 minutes. The  of rain in August made the month the wettest ever recorded in Houston since record keeping began in 1892, more than doubling the previous record of  in June 2001. The storm surge peaked at 6 feet at Port Lavaca, reducing outflow of rainwater from land to sea.  During the storm, more than 800 Houston area flights were canceled, including 704\u00a0at George Bush Intercontinental Airport and 123\u00a0at William P. Hobby Airport. Both airports eventually closed. Several tornadoes were spawned in the area, one of which damaged or destroyed the roofs of dozens of homes in Sienna Plantation. As of August\u00a029, 14\u00a0fatalities have been confirmed from flooding in the Houston area, including 6 from the same family who died when their van was swept off a flooded bridge. A police officer drowned while trying to escape rising waters.  An estimated 25\u201330\u00a0percent of Harris County\u2014roughly 444\u00a0mi2 (1,150\u00a0km2) of land\u2014was submerged.  Late on August\u00a027, a mandatory evacuation was issued for all of Bay City as model projections indicated the downtown area would be inundated by  of water. Flooding was anticipated to cut off access to the city around 1:00\u00a0p.m. CDT on August\u00a028. Evacuations took place in Conroe on August\u00a028 following release of water from the Lake Conroe dam. On the morning on August\u00a029, a levee along Columbia Lakes in Brazoria County was breached, prompting officials to urgently request for everyone in the area to evacuate.  On August 28, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began controlled water releases from Addicks and Barker Reservoirs in the Buffalo Bayou watershed in an attempt to manage flood levels in the immediate area. According to the local Corps commander, \"It's going to be better to release the water through the gates directly into Buffalo Bayou as opposed to letting it go around the end and through additional neighborhoods and ultimately into the bayou.\" At the time the releases started, the reservoirs had been rising at more than  per hour. Many people began evacuating the area, fearing a levee breach. Despite attempts to alleviate the water rise, the Addicks Reservoir reached capacity on the morning of August\u00a029 and began spilling out. The NASA Johnson Space Center was closed to employees and visitors due to the flooding until September 5. Only the critical mission control staff remain and reside in the control rooms to monitor procedures of the International Space Station.  Deep East Texas and Beaumont to Port Arthur area  The Beaumont\u2013Port Arthur metropolitan area also experienced torrential precipitation, including  of rainfall in Beaumont. Rising waters of the Neches River caused the city to lose service from its main pump station, as well as its secondary water source in Hardin County, cutting water supply to the city for an unknown amount of time. Flooding to the north and east of the Houston area resulted in mandatory evacuations for portions of Liberty, Jefferson, and Tyler counties, while Jasper and Newton counties were under a voluntary evacuation. One death occurred in Beaumont when a woman exited her disabled vehicle, but was swept away. In Port Arthur, the mayor stated that the entire city was submerged by water. Hundreds of displaced residents went to the Robert A. \"Bob\" Bowers Civic Center for shelter, but they were evacuated again after the building began to flood. Water entered at least several hundreds of homes in Jefferson County.  Louisiana  Heavy rainfall extended eastward into Louisiana, with the state recording up to  of precipitation near the town of Iowa. In the city of Lake Charles, flood waters reached  in height in some areas, with homes inundated and hundreds of people forced to evacuate in one neighborhood alone. Throughout the state, about 500\u00a0people were rescued by August\u00a028, while 269\u00a0people went to a shelter in southwest Louisiana, about 200\u00a0of whom were rescued from their homes. An EF2 tornado near Evangeline damaged four homes, one of which was destroyed. The tornado also damaged fences, a motorcycle, a pickup truck, and toppled three electrical poles.  Elsewhere  Rain-slicked roads were blamed for two fatal accidents in Arkansas. In Alabama, a tornado in the vicinity of Reform damaged two homes and destroyed a barn along State Route 17, while four people were hospitalized for their injuries. A possible tornado in Lamar County near Kennedy caused damage to trees and roofs. In Tennessee, more than 19,000\u00a0people lost electricity in Memphis. Low-lying streets in the area were inundated with water. One indirect death occurred in Memphis due to a weather-related head-on collision of a car and a tractor trailer on Interstate 40. Heavy rainfall in Nashville inundated a number of roads and flooded an apartment complex, resulting in the evacuation of 13\u00a0people. Overall, about 50\u00a0people in the city evacuated from flooded areas. Rain in Kentucky was blamed for a fatal car accident.  On September 1, the outer bands of Harvey's remnants passed through North Carolina. Severe weather was reported across the central part of the state. Tornadoes touched down in Angier, Clayton, and Smithfield, high wind knocked out power in Fuquay-Varina, Sanford, and Holly Springs, and large hail hit parts of Wake, Harnett, and Johnston counties. In Willow Spring, hail larger than softballs damaged homes and cars. Flash flooding hit Greenville further east.  Energy production  Energy production in the Gulf of Mexico declined in the wake of Harvey by approximately 21% \u2014 the output dropped to 378,633 barrels per day from the original 1.75 million barrels of oil produced each day. The Eagle Ford Rock Formation (shale oil and gas) in southern Texas reduced production by 300,000 to 500,000 bpd, according to the Texas Railroad Commission. Many energy-related ports and terminals closed, delaying about fourteen crude oil tankers. About 2.25 million bpd of refining capacity was offline for several days; that is about 12% of total US capacity, with refineries affected at Corpus Christi, and later Port Arthur and Beaumont, and Lake Charles, Louisiana. The price of Brent crude versus West Texas Intermediate crude oil achieved a split of U.S.\u2009$5.  Two ExxonMobil refineries had to be shut down following related storm damage and releases of hazardous pollutants. Two oil storage tanks owned by Burlington Resources Oil and Gas collectively spilled 30,000\u00a0gallons of crude in DeWitt County. An additional 8,500\u00a0gallons of wastewater was spilled in the incidents.  On August 30, the CEO of Arkema warned one of its chemical plants in Crosby, Texas, could explode or be subject to intense fire due to the loss of \"critical refrigeration\" of materials. All workers at the facility and residents within  were evacuated. Eight of the plant's nine refrigeration units failed without power, enabling the stored chemicals to decompose and become combustible. Two explosions occurred around 2:00\u00a0a.m. on August\u00a031; 21\u00a0emergency personnel were briefly hospitalized.  Due to the shutdown in refineries, gas prices did see an increase nationwide. However, the increase was not as extensive as Hurricane Katrina. Additionally, Harvey's impact coincided with Labor Day Weekend, which sees a traditional increase in gas prices due to the heavy travel for that weekend. Nonetheless, the spike brought the highest gas prices in two years.  Sports  The flooding in Houston from the storm required the traditional Governor's Cup National Football League preseason game between the Dallas Cowboys and the Houston Texans scheduled for August 31 to be moved from NRG Stadium in Houston to AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. The game was later cancelled to allow the Houston Texans players to return to Houston after the storm. In addition, the Houston Astros were forced to move their August 29\u201331 series with the Texas Rangers from Minute Maid Park in Houston to Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida; ironically, just two weeks later, Hurricane Irma would force the stadium's regular tenants, the Tampa Bay Rays, to move three home games to Citi Field in New York City. In the aftermath, the Houston Astros began to wear patches which had the logo of the team with the word \"Strong\" on the bottom of the patch, as well as promoting the hashtag Houston Strong, prominently displaying them as the Astros won the 2017 World Series. Manager A. J. Hinch has stated in an interview that the team wasn't just playing for a title, but to help boost moral support for the city. The annual Texas Kickoff game that was to feature BYU and LSU to kick off the 2017 college football season was moved to the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans. The NCAA FBS football game between Houston and UTSA was postponed due to the aftermath of the storm. It was originally scheduled for September 2 at the Alamodome in San Antonio and was ultimately canceled.  The Houston Dynamo rescheduled a planned Major League Soccer match against Sporting Kansas City on August 26 to October 11. The Houston Dash of the National Women's Soccer League rescheduled their August 27 match against the North Carolina Courage to a later date. Both teams moved their training camps to Toyota Stadium in Frisco, Texas (near Dallas) while preparing for their next matches; the Dash's match the following week, against the Seattle Reign, was played in Frisco, with all proceeds from ticket sales benefiting an American Red Cross relief fund for hurricane victims. The Dynamo and Major League Soccer also donated a combined $1 million into the hurricane relief fund, while also opening BBVA Compass Stadium to accept donated supplies for processing and distribution.  Athletic events were rescheduled as far away as Kentucky, where the storm's remnants were expected to cause heavy rains on September 1, interfering with Friday night high school football. More than 50 high schools in the state moved games that had been scheduled for Friday to either Thursday or Saturday.  Aftermath  Texas Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner imposed a mandatory curfew on August\u00a029 from midnight to 5\u00a0a.m. local time until further notice. He cited looting as the primary reason for the curfew. On August\u00a029, President Trump, First Lady Melania Trump, and U.S. Senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz toured damage in the Corpus Christi metropolitan area. President Trump made a formal request for $5.95\u00a0billion in federal funding on August\u00a031 for affected areas, the vast majority of which would go to FEMA.  Texas Governor Greg Abbott deployed the state's entire National Guard for search and rescue, recovery, and clean up operations due to the devastating damage caused by the storm and resulting floods. Other states' National Guard's have offered assistance, with several having already been sent. Meanwhile, the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement assigned approximately 150 employees from around the country to assist with disaster relief efforts, while stating that no immigration enforcement operations would be conducted.  Approximately 32,000\u00a0people were displaced in shelters across the state by August\u00a031. The George R. Brown Convention Center, the state's largest shelter, reached capacity with 8,000\u00a0evacuees. The NRG Center opened as a large public shelter accordingly. More than 210,000\u00a0people registered with FEMA for disaster assistance.  The Cajun Navy, an informal organization of volunteers with boats from Louisiana, deployed to Texas to assist in high-water rescues.  The Houston Independent School District announced that all students on any of the district's campuses would be eligible for free lunch throughout the 2017\u201318 school year. The Federal Department of Education eased financial aid rules and procedures for those affected by Harvey, giving schools the ability to waive paperwork requirements; loan borrowers were given more flexibility in managing their loan payments. A 36-year-old inmate sentenced to death for a 2003 murder was granted a temporary reprieve as a result of Harvey, as his legal team was based in Harris County, an area heavily affected by the hurricane.  By August\u00a030, corporations across the nation collectively donated more than $72\u00a0million to relief efforts, with 42\u00a0companies donating at least $1\u00a0million. Professional athletic teams, their players, and managers provided large donations to assist victims of the storm. The Houston Astros pledged $4\u00a0million to relief along with all proceeds from their home game raffles. Houston Rockets owner Leslie Alexander also donated $4\u00a0million to the cause. A fundraiser established by Houston Texans defensive lineman J. J. Watt exceeded $37\u00a0million. For his efforts, Watt received the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award. The Texas Rangers and Tennessee Titans both provided $1\u00a0million, while the New England Patriots pledged to match up to $1\u00a0million in donations to the Red Cross. Multiple Hollywood celebrities also pitched in, collectively donating more than $10\u00a0million, with Sandra Bullock providing the largest single donation of $1\u00a0million. Leonardo DiCaprio provided $1\u00a0million to the United Way Harvey Recovery Fund through his foundation. President Donald Trump donated $1\u00a0million to 12 charities involved in relief efforts. Rachael Ray provided donations totaling $1\u00a0million to animal shelters across the Houston area.  Economic loss estimates  Moody's Analytics initially estimated the total economic cost of the storm at $81 billion to $108 billion or more; most of the economic losses are damage to homes and commercial property. Reinsurance company Aon Benfield estimated total economic losses at $100\u00a0billion, including $30\u00a0billion in insured damage, making Harvey the costliest disaster in 2017 by their calculations. USA Today reported an AccuWeather estimate of $190 billion, released August 31. On September 3, Texas state governor Greg Abbott estimated that damages will be between $150\u00a0billion and $180\u00a0billion, surpassing the $120\u00a0billion that it took to rebuild New Orleans after Katrina. According to weather analytics firm Planalytics, lost revenue to Houston area retailers and restaurants alone will be approximately $1 billion. The Houston area controls 4% of the spending power in the United States.  In September\u00a02017, the Insurance Council of Texas estimated the total insured losses from Hurricane Harvey at $19\u00a0billion. This figure represents $11\u00a0billion in flood losses insured by the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), $3\u00a0billion in \"insured windstorm and other storm-related property losses\"; and about $4.75\u00a0billion in insured flood losses of private and commercial vehicles. By January\u00a01, 2018, payouts from the NFIP reached $7.6\u00a0billion against total estimated losses of $8.5\u20139.5\u00a0billion. Economists Michael Hicks and Mark Burton at Ball State University estimated damage in the Houston metropolitan area alone at $198.63\u00a0billion. Preliminary reporting from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration set a more concrete total at $125\u00a0billion, making Harvey the 2nd costliest tropical cyclone on record, behind Hurricane Katrina with 2017\u00a0costs of $161\u00a0billion (after adjusting for inflation).  A significant portion of the storm's damages are uninsured losses. Regular homeowner insurance policies generally exclude coverage for flooding, as the NFIP underwrites most flood insurance policies in the US. Although the purchase of flood insurance is obligatory for federally guaranteed mortgages for homes within the 100-year flood plain, enforcement of the requirement is difficult and many homes, even within the 100-year flood plain, lack flood insurance. In Harris County, Texas\u2014which includes the city of Houston\u2014only 15% of homes have flood insurance policies issued by the NFIP. Participation in the NFIP is higher, but still low, in neighboring Galveston (41%), Brazoria (26%), and Chambers Counties (21%). Homeowners sued authorities after reservoir releases damaged homes.  Federal government response  On September\u00a08, President Donald Trump signed into law H.R. 601, which among other spending actions designated $15\u00a0billion for Hurricane Harvey relief.  Non-governmental organization response The American Red Cross, Salvation Army, United Methodist Committee on Relief (UMCOR), Gulf Coast Synod Disaster Relief, United States Equestrian Federation, Humane Society of the United States, Knights of Columbus, Samaritan's Purse, Catholic Charities USA, AmeriCares, BakerRipley, Operation BBQ relief, many celebrities, and many other charitable organizations provided help to the victims of the storm. Anarchists (including Antifa) also provided relief. Business aviation played a part in the rescue efforts, providing support during the storm as well as relief flights bringing in suppliers in the immediate aftermath.  Volunteers from amateur radio's emergency service wing, the Amateur Radio Emergency Service, provided communications in American Red Cross shelters in South Texas.  Many corporations also contributed to relief efforts. Operation BBQ relief had the help from several local individuals and businesses kick off the support of providing meals for volunteers and victims. Smokers, pallets of wood, and another company came up with the pounds of pork to kick off the support effort. Operation BBQ relief vendors volunteering for the Houston flood relief estimates that they will serve at least 450,000\u00a0meals. On August\u00a027, 2017, it was estimated that Operation BBQ relief will be expecting 25,000 to 30,000\u00a0meals a day.  On August\u00a027, 2017, KSL-TV, KSL Newsradio, FM100.3, and 103.5 The Arrow created a fundraiser to help Texas residents impacted by Hurricane Harvey. Because of an anonymous donor willing to match $2 for every $1 raised up to a total of $100,000, Peter Huntsman also agreed to match donations up to $100,000. The combined total of $200,000 was met by August\u00a031, 2017. Their new goal is $1\u00a0million.  Foreign government response Singapore dispatched Boeing CH-47 Chinook helicopters from the Republic of Singapore Air Force to areas affected by the hurricane for humanitarian operations, working alongside the Texas National Guard. Israel pledged $1\u00a0million in relief funds for restoration of non-state run communal infrastructure. Mexico sent volunteers from the Mexican Red Cross, firemen from Coahuila, and rescue teams from Guanajuato to Houston to assist in relief. Mexico later rescinded their commitment for aid after Hurricane Katia made landfall on Mexico's Gulf Coast, on September\u00a09, 2017. Venezuela offered $5\u00a0million through the state-owned Citgo Petroleum, which operates a refinery in Corpus Christi.  Health and environmental hazards in flood waters Houston officials stated that the Houston drinking water and sewer systems were intact; however, \"hundreds of thousands of people across the 38\u00a0Texas counties affected by Hurricane Harvey use private wells, according to an estimate by Louisiana State University researchers, and those people must fend for themselves.\" Additionally, Harris County, which includes Houston, contains a large number of Superfund-designed brownfield sites that contain a wide variety of toxins and carcinogens. Two Superfund sites in Corpus Christi were flooded.  Baby boom In the months after the hurricane struck, some hospitals in Texas saw a spike in birth rates, with a 17% increase in birth rates being reported at Corpus Christi Medical Center. A similar, larger baby boom also occurred after Hurricane Sandy in 2012.  Retirement  On April 11, 2018, at the 40th session of the RA IV hurricane committee, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Harvey from its rotating name lists, due to the extensive damage and loss of life it caused along its track, particularly in the state of Texas, and its name will never again be used for another Atlantic hurricane. It will be replaced with Harold for the 2023 season.  Environmental factors  Houston is located in the southeastern United States on the Gulf Coastal Plain, and its clay-based soils provide poor drainage. There is a tendency for storms to move very slowly over the region, allowing them to produce tremendous amounts of rain over an extended period, as occurred during Tropical Storm Claudette in 1979, and Tropical Storm Allison in 2001. The area is a very flat flood plain at shallow gradient, slowly draining rainwater through an intricate network of channels and bayous to the sea. The main waterways, the San Jacinto River and the Buffalo Bayou, meander slowly, laden with mud, and have little capacity for carrying storm water.  Urban development Houston has seen rapid urban development (urban sprawl), with absorbent prairie and wetlands replaced by hard surfaces which rapidly shed storm water, overwhelming the drainage capacity of the rivers and channels. Between 1992 and 2010, almost 25,000 acres of wetlands were lost, decreasing the detention capacity of the region by four billion gallons. However, Harvey was estimated to have dropped more than fifteen trillion gallons of water in the area.  The Katy Prairie in western Harris County, which once helped to absorb floodwaters in the region, has been reduced to one quarter of its previous size in the last several decades due to suburban development, and one analysis discovered that more than 7,000 housing units have been built within the 100-year floodplain in Harris County since 2010.  Subsidence As Houston has expanded, rainwater infiltration in the region has lessened and aquifer extraction increased, causing the depletion of underground aquifers. When the saturated ground dries, the soil can be compressed and the land surface elevation decreases in a process called subsidence. Subsidence can also occur due to sediment settling. Specifically, regions to the north and west of the Houston metro have seen  to  of subsidence per year. While oil extraction can cause subsidence, in the Houston-Galveston area, most oil has been extracted from sandstone that has relatively negligible ability to compress once oil has been removed. Thus, oil extraction has not resulted in significant subsidence. Further, the volume of oil extraction in the Houston area is too low to cause significant subsidence.  Climate change  The Gulf of Mexico is known for hurricanes in August, so their incidence alone cannot be attributed to global warming, but the warming climate does influence certain attributes of storms. Studies in this regard show that storms tend to intensify more rapidly prior to landfall. Weather events are due to multiple factors, and so cannot be said to be caused by one precondition, but climate change affects aspects of extreme events, and very likely worsened some of the impacts of Harvey. In a briefing, the World Meteorological Organization stated that the quantity of rainfall from Harvey had very likely been increased by climate change.  Harvey approached Houston over sea-surface waters which were significantly above average temperatures. Warm waters provide the main source of energy for hurricanes, and increased ocean heat can result in storms being larger, more intense and longer lasting, in particular bringing greatly increased rainfall. Sea level rise added to the resulting problems. According to officials from the Harris County Flood Control District, Harvey caused the third '500-year' flood in three years. The National Climate Assessment states:  Warmer air can hold more water vapor, in accordance with the Clausius\u2013Clapeyron relation, and there has been a global increase of daily rainfall records. Regional sea surface temperatures around Houston have risen around 0.5\u00a0\u00b0C (0.9\u00a0\u00b0F) in recent decades, which caused a 3\u20135% increase in moisture in the atmosphere. This had the effect of allowing Harvey to strengthen more than expected. The water temperature of the Gulf of Mexico was above average for this time of the year, and likely to be a factor in Harvey's impact. Within a week of Harvey, Hurricane Irma formed in the eastern Atlantic, due to the similar conditions involving unusually warm seawater. Some scientists fear this may be becoming a 'new normal'. Also higher sea-water temperatures can make hurricanes more devastating.  The slow movement of Harvey over Texas allowed the storm to drop prolonged heavy rains on the state, as has also happened with earlier storms. Harvey's stalled position was due to weak prevailing winds linked to a greatly expanded subtropical high pressure system over much of the US at the time, which had pushed the jet stream to the north. Research and model simulations have indicated an association between this pattern and human-caused climate change.

On August 17, 2017, a tropical depression formed over the Atlantic Ocean from a low-pressure area that had been present for several days. The depression strengthened and was upgraded to a tropical storm the next day as it moved northwestward. On August 19, the storm reached hurricane intensity, and by August 21, it reached Category 4 intensity. Harvey weakened to a Category 1 hurricane as it moved inland, but restrengthened to a Category 4 hurricane as it moved back over the Gulf of Mexico. On August 25, Harvey made landfall in Texas as a Category 4 hurricane with winds of 130 mph (215 km/h), and it weakened to a Category 1 hurricane as it moved inland. Harvey caused catastrophic flooding in Texas, particularly in and around Houston, which was hit by the eye of the storm. Harvey is estimated to have caused $75 billion in damage, making it the costliest hurricane in United States history. The storm caused at least 68 deaths and nearly 200,000 people were displaced. On August 23, the Hurricane Harvey Task Force, consisting of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and other federal agencies, was formed to support the recovery from the hurricane.

History The species is very rare. It was once believed to have been consumed by goats to the point of extinction.  When the island's last goat was shot in 1983, that same day a goat hunter discovered a single instance of the plant. It was the only example found in the wild until 1997, when, as part of a weed-eradication program, people searching the steep, volcanic cliffs of Raoul Island discovered fifty of the plants. Cuttings and seedlings raised from these plants are now being planted across Raoul Island.  Nonetheless, the species still remains at severe risk of extinction, mainly through weed invasion of its unstable, volcanic cliff habitat.

History  The Casa de Portugal was founded on 13 July 1935 with the aim of representing all Portuguese immigrants and their descendants in S\u00e3o Paulo. There were many Portuguese associations in the city, representing immigrants from specific regions of Portugal, and the original idea of the founders was to bring these organizations under one roof. The foundation of the Casa de Portugal saw representatives of Uni\u00e3o Transmontana, Casa do Minho, Uni\u00e3o Portuguesa, Centro Beir\u00e3o and Centro do Douro. Other organizations were subsequently invited, but preferred to maintain their regional character and refused. The first president was the philologist Francisco da Luz Rebelo Gon\u00e7alves, a professor at the newly founded University of S\u00e3o Paulo, but he remained in office for only 10 months and was succeeded for the interim by Aur\u00e9lio Martins Arrobas and in 1936 by Fernando Ribeiro Bacellar.  Initially the Casa de Portugal worked at the headquarters of the Casa do Minho and then in rented properties. Through donations from members and bank loans land and buildings were purchased on the Avenida da Liberdade, in the city center in 1943. The inauguration of the headquarters took place on December 27, 1955.  Features  The headquarters of the Casa de Portugal is a neocolonial building of five floors designed by Portuguese architect Ricardo Severo. The lobby is decorated with paintings depicting Afonso I, the first king of Portugal, and Manuel da Nobrega, a Portuguese Jesuit priest very influential in the early History of Brazil, and who participated in the founding of several cities, such as Recife, Salvador, Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo, and many Jesuit Colleges and seminaries. The building also has meeting rooms, a restaurant, theater, gallery exhibition and a ballroom with a capacity for 1,000 people.  The Casa de Portugal also serves as headquarters for the Council of the Luso-Brazilian Community of S\u00e3o Paulo, the Portuguese Chamber of Commerce and the Ombudsman of the Portuguese Community. It was also headquarters for the Consulate of Portugal in S\u00e3o Paulo and the Cam\u00f5es Institute, but these institutions have moved to a building in the Jardim Am\u00e9rica area in 2004.  Library  The creation of a library for the Casa de Portugal had been planned since its foundation, when the partners began to donate books to the collection. In 1957 the library was opened, and in 1991 it was extended with an auditorium and reading room. Currently it has 12,000 volumes, of which almost half are dedicated to history and Luso-Brazilian literature.

It is the 87th film in ESPN's 30 for 30 series. The film was aired on ESPN directly after the 2016 Heisman Award Ceremony and premiered to over 2 million viewers, making it the highest rated 30 for 30 film since 2015.  At the 69th Primetime Emmy Awards it was one of that season's 30 for 30 films nominated for Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Series.  Background  In 1985, a rivalry started between the University of Notre Dame and University of Miami football teams after the Miami Hurricanes beat the Notre Dame Fighting Irish 58\u20137. This loss marked head coach Gerry Faust's last game at Notre Dame.  The rivalry culminated in a showdown three years later, which was dubbed \"Catholics vs. Convicts.\" The name originated from a t-shirt slogan created by Notre Dame students Joe Frederick and Michael Caponigro. The slogan played on Notre Dame's Catholic background and the public perception of Miami's players as college football's \"bad boys,\" a reputation that was reinforced by the arrests of a number of Miami players. Both the Notre Dame Fighting Irish and the Miami Hurricanes came into the game undefeated. Cleveland Gary's controversial \"phantom fumble\" is examined closely in the film.  While studying the game the filmmakers re-examined a second close call by the referees which had gone largely unnoticed at the time.  Both coaches and several players from the game had never seen the replay, leading many of the subjects to reconsider the outcome of the game. Many sportswriters consider it one of the greatest college football games of all time.  The documentary is partially based on director Patrick Creadon's experience as a Notre Dame undergraduate at the time. Creadon was a senior at Notre Dame in 1988 and knew the students behind the \"Catholics vs. Convicts\" slogan.  Cast  Creadon went back to interview several of his classmates for the documentary, including Patrick Walsh, his best friend from high school who was involved in the t-shirt scandal, and Tony Rice, the starting quarterback who lived down the hall from them in Dillon Hall. The film also features interviews with head coaches Lou Holtz and Jimmy Johnson; Notre Dame defensive coordinator Barry Alvarez; Notre Dame players Chris Zorich, Pat Eilers, Pat Terrell, and Todd Lyght, among others; and Miami players Steve Walsh, Cleveland Gary, and Leon Searcy, among others.  Reception  Writing for The Wall Street Journal, John Anderson called Catholics vs. Convicts a \"gripping gridiron drama.\" Sporting News ranks the film \"among the best\" of the 30 for 30 franchise.

The book analyzes the main features and possible causes of the present science's crisis.  Content  Science on the verge, written by Alice Benessia, Silvio Funtowicz, Mario Giampietro, \u00c2ngela Guimar\u00e3es Pereira, Jerome Ravetz, Andrea Saltelli, Roger Strand, and Jeroen P. van der Sluijs, with a preface by Dan Sarewitz, follows different threads of the present science's crisis (lost reproducibility, collapsing peer review, perverse metrics, evidence based policy's dysfunctions, techno-science and his hubris, science as metaphysics ...) and presents a first systematic analysis of the main causes of the present predicaments.   Chapter 1. The chapter entitled 'Who will solve the crisis in science?' tackles the following questions:   Is there a crisis?   What is being done 'from within'? Is this sufficient?   What are the diagnoses for the crisis' root causes, and   what are the solutions 'from without'?  Chapter 2. This is chapter entitled 'The fallacy of evidence based policy' tackles:  Quantification as hypocognition;   Socially constructed ignorance & uncomfortable knowledge;   Ancien r\u00e9gime syndrome;   Quantitative story telling.    Chapter 3. This is chapter entitled 'Never late, never lost, never unprepared' treats:  Trajectories of innovation and modes of demarcation of science from society:   'separation',   'hybridization' and   'substitution';   What contradictions these trajectories generate.     Chapter 4. This chapter entitled 'Institutions on the verge' discusses:   Working at the science policy interface;   The special case of the European Commission's in house science service;   The Joint Research Centre as a boundary institutions;   Diagnosis, challenges and perspectives.  Chapter 5. This chapter entitled 'Numbers running wild' deals with:   Uses and abuses of quantification;  The loss of 'craft skills' with numbers;   The case of '7.9% of all species shall become extinct'.  Chapter 6. This chapter entitled 'Doubt has been eliminated' tells about:  Gro Harlem Brundtland's famous 2007 speech, after the Fourth IPCC report and the Stern review;   When science becomes a 'life philosophy';   Science as the metaphysics  of modernity;   The inquiry of the Norwegian Research Ethics Committee for Science and Technology.  Reviews  From Joseph A. Tainter, Professor of Sustainability, Utah State University, \"Scientists working in the policy arena are often na\u00efve about the impact of their findings. Producing rational results, scientists expect their research to be rationally accepted. The fundamental problem is that humans are not rational. We are emotional thinkers. Science on the Verge exposes many of the fallacies in science applied to societal problems. No matter how good the science, public issues are always ideological and political.\"    From Judith Curry,  climatologist and former chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology writing on her blog \"This book is a very rich resource for grappling with the problems with science in the 21st century \u2013 the articles themselves, as well as the extensive references.

Further fortified in the Middle Ages, tradition holds that it was for several centuries the seat of Clan MacKinnon. It is located east of Kirkibost on the west shore of Loch Slapin.  History  The original structure of Dun Ringill is consistent with an Iron Age Broch dating to approximately the first years of the common era. The main and subordinate structures were occupied and modified throughout its history until the 19th century. Tradition relates that the structure was occupied by the MacKinnons as their clan seat well before the 16th century. It is mentioned in historical texts in the 16th century, after which the MacKinnons moved their seat to Dunakin.<ref name=\"Lochalsh' pp. 39-43\">The Medieval Castles of Skye and Lochalsh pp. 39-43. Miket, R., and Roberts, D. Birlin Limited, 2007, .</ref>   Description   Dun Ringill today is a stacked stone ruin overlooking Loch Slapin. The present structure is approximately  in height and  on each side, with a ditch following the outer wall. Its most notable feature is the central landward facing doorway approximately  high that leads into the center of the structure. The interior of the structure contained two rectangular buildings measuring . The original layout was similar to that of a broch, a form of complex Atlantic roundhouse.  A stone wall foundation encloses area adjacent to the structure. Similarly to other castles and fortified houses, the wall probably formed a defensive perimeter and livestock enclosure. The remains of the wall itself are hidden by vegetation. A site survey has shown that there are remains of other buildings in the immediate vicinity; and although their age is uncertain, it is likely their construction and occupation was throughout the history of Dun Ringill up until the 19th century.  To the north and west is a hilly coastal plain. Loch Slapin lies to the east and south of the structure. On either side of the structure are earth and stone ramps that descend down to the ocean. These ramps likely allowed easy access to the water and shipping. Since roads in this part of Skye did not exist until recent times, sea travel was the predominant mode of transportation.   In popular culture  The rock band Jethro Tull performed a song entitled \"Dun Ringill\" on their 1979 Stormwatch album.  The lyrics call for a meeting down by Dun Ringill during the wee hours of a stormy night, when \"we'll watch the old gods play.\" The song was written by Tull leader Ian Anderson, who lived at Kilmarie House, within walking distance of Dun Ringill, at the time.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Economy of Nepal\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The economy of Nepal is developing category and largely dependent on agriculture and remittances. An isolated, agrarian society until the mid-20th century, Nepal entered the modern era in 1951 without schools, hospitals, roads, telecommunications, electric power, industry, or civil service. The country has, however, made progress toward sustainable economic growth since the 1950s. The country was opened to economic liberalization, leading to economic growth and improvement in living standards when compared to the past. The biggest challenges faced by the country in achieving higher economic development are the frequent changes in political leadership, as well as corruption.  Nepal has used a series of five-year plans in an attempt to make progress in economic development.  It completed its ninth economic development plan in 2002; its currency has been made convertible, and 17 state enterprises have been privatised. Foreign aid to Nepal accounts for more than half of the development budget. Government priorities over the years have been the development of transportation and communication facilities, agriculture, and industry. Since 1975, improved government administration and rural development efforts have been emphasised.  Agriculture remains Nepal's principal economic activity, employing about 65% of the population and providing 31.7% of GDP. Only about 20% of the total area is cultivable; another 40.7% is forested (i.e., covered by shrubs, pastureland and forest); most of the rest is mountainous. Fruits and vegetables (apples, pears, tomatoes, various salads, peach, nectarine, potatoes), as well as rice and wheat are the main food crops. The lowland Terai region produces an agricultural surplus, part of which supplies the food-deficient hill areas.  GDP is heavily dependent on remittances (9.1%) of foreign workers.  Subsequently, economic development in social services and infrastructure in Nepal has not made dramatic progress. A countrywide primary education system is under development, and Tribhuvan University has several campuses. Although eradication efforts continue, malaria had been controlled in the fertile but previously uninhabitable Terai region in the south. Kathmandu is linked to India and nearby hill regions by road and an expanding highway network. The capital was almost out of fuel and supplies, due to a crippling general strike in southern Nepal on 17 February 2008.  Major towns are connected to the capital by telephone and domestic air services. The export-oriented carpet and garment industries have grown rapidly in recent years. Together, they account for approximately 70% of the country's merchandise exports.  The Cost of Living Index in Nepal is comparatively lower than many countries but not the least. The quality of life has declined to much less desirous value in recent years. Nepal was ranked 54th worst of 81 ranked countries (those with GHI > 5.0) on the Global Hunger Index in 2011, between Cambodia and Togo. Nepal's current score of 19.5  is better than in 2010 (20.0) and much improved than its score of 27.5 in 1990.  Foreign investments and taxation Huge numbers of Small Foreign Investments come to Nepal via the Non Resident Nepali, who are investing in many sectors. Nepal has a huge potential for hydroelectricity. Accordingly, a large number of foreign companies are willing to invest in Nepal, but political instability has stopped the process. Nepal has entered into agreements for avoidance of double taxation (all in credit method) with 10 countries (PSRD) since 2000. Similarly, it has Investment protection agreements with 5 countries (PSRD) since 1983. In 2014, Nepal restricted the Foreign aid by setting a minimum limit for foreign grants, soft and commercial loans from its development partners.  Imports and exports  Nepal's merchandise trade balance has improved somewhat since 2000 with the growth of the carpet and garment industries. In the fiscal year 2000\u20132001, exports posted a greater increase (14%) than imports (4.5%), helping bring the trade deficit down by 4% from the previous year to $749 million. Recently, the European Union has become the largest buyer of ready-made garments; fruits and vegetables (mostly apples, pears, tomatoes, various salads, peach, nectarine, potatoes, rice) from Nepal. Exports to the EU accounted for 46.13 percent of the country's garment exports.  The annual monsoon rain strongly influences economic growth. From 1996 to 1999, real GDP growth averaged less than 4%. The growth rate recovered in 1999, rising to 6% before slipping slightly in 2001 to 5.5%.  Strong export performance, including earnings from tourism, and external aid have helped improve the overall balance of payments and increase international reserves. Nepal receives substantial amounts of external assistance from the United Kingdom, the United States, Japan, Germany, and the Scandinavian countries.  Several multilateral organisations such as the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the UN Development Programme also provide assistance. In June 1998, Nepal submitted its memorandum on a foreign trade regime to the World Trade Organization and in May 2000 began direct negotiations on its accession.  Resources  Progress has been made in exploiting Nepal's natural resources, tourism and hydroelectricity. With eight of the world's 10 highest mountain peaks, including Mount Everest at 8,848.86 m. In the early 1990s, one large public sector project and a number of private projects were planned; some have been completed. The most significant private sector financed hydroelectric projects currently in operation are the Khimti Khola (60 MW) and the Bhote Koshi Project (36 MW). The project is still undergoing and has dependency on China, India and Japan to take the further steps.  Nepal has 83,000 MW of theoretical and 42,133 MW of technically/financially viable hydroelectric potential, however the total installed capacity, at present, is mere 1095 MW.  The environmental impact of Nepal's hydroelectric Own calendar (Bikram Sambat) New year in mid- April projects has been limited by the fact that most are \"run-of-the-river\" with only one storage project undertaken to date. The largest hydroelectric plant under consideration is the West Seti Dam (750 MW) storage project dedicated to exports to be built by the private sector. Negotiations with India for a power purchase agreement have been underway for several years, but agreement on pricing and financing remains a problem. Currently demand for electricity is increasing at 8-10% a year whereas Nepal's option to have agreement with India will make this fulfilment against demand.  Population pressure on natural resources is increasing. Over-population is already straining the \"carrying capacity\" of the middle hill areas, particularly the Kathmandu Valley, resulting in the depletion of forest cover for crops, fuel, and fodder and contributing to erosion and flooding. Although steep mountain terrain makes exploitation difficult, mineral surveys have found small deposits of limestone, magnesite, zinc, copper, iron, mica, lead, and cobalt.  The development of hydroelectric power projects also cause some tension with local indigenous groups, recently empowered by Nepal's ratification of ILO Convention 169.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Balmorhea State Park\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Balmorhea State Park is a  state park located on the San Solomon Springs in Reeves County, Texas, opened in 1968. The closest city is Balmorhea, Texas. Texas Parks and Wildlife Department manages the park. The park is open year-round, and visitation is capped at 900 people per day.  Features The main feature of the park is the ,  freshwater pool built around the springs. It is the world\u2019s largest spring-fed swimming pool. The spring has a constant flow of 22 to  a day so no chlorination is required. The water temperature ranges from  and up to  deep.  The pool bottom is flat in the more shallow areas and has a more natural rock bottom in the deeper areas. The pool is used for both swimming, snorkeling and scuba diving.  History The Texas State Parks Board bought San Solomon Springs and the surrounding land in 1934. Company 1856 of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) built the pool between 1936 and 1941 as part of the New Deal during the Great Depression as a way to open up jobs for people needing work. The CCC also built San Solomon Springs Courts, which rents rooms available for overnight stays. Camping and recreational vehicle sites are also available. A private concessionaire operated the facility until 1968, when the Parks and Wildlife Department took over management, and it became part of the state parks system.  The Balmorhea State Park Cienega Project, started in 1995, recreated a desert wetland in the park. The original cienega was lost when the CCC channeled water from the springs in to the pool. The cienega now serves as a habitat for endangered fish such as the Comanche Springs pupfish and Pecos gambusia as well as other aquatic life, birds and other animals.  In early 2018, a wall in the pool around the diving board collapsed, and the pool was shut down. Houston-based Apache Corporation pledged to match all donations made to repair the pool up to one million dollars. The goal was reached in about four months. Sixty percent of the donations were under $100, however, other Texas companies made significant contributions, including Saulsbury Industries, Texas Pacific Land Trust, McCoy Remme Ranches, Legend Energy Services, Pioneer Energy Services and Garrison Brothers Distillery. Apache Corporation also established a one million dollar endowment fund for the park.  The pool reopened March 1, 2019 after repairs to the pool were completed. Only day-use facilities were available while the renovation of San Solomon Courts and campgrounds were still under way.  Texas Parks and Wildlife Department shut the park again on September 3, 2019 to repair the park's failing septic system and again in January 2021 for further repairs \"for the foreseeable future.\" The park partially reopened in June of 2021 with the swimming area reopening.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Jackson Beardy\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Jackson Beardy (July 24, 1944 \u2013 December 7, 1984) was an Indigenous Anishinaabe artist born in Canada. His works are characterized by scenes from Ojibwe and Cree oral traditions and many focus on the relationship between humans and nature. He belonged to the Woodland School of Art and was a prominent member of the Indian Group of Seven. His work has contributed to the recognition of Indigenous contemporary art within Canada.  Early life and education  Jackson Beardy was born July 24, 1944. He was the son of John Beardy and Dinah Monias and fifth of 13 children. Beardy's father supported the family as a trapper, hunter, pedlar, gold miner, fisherman and fish filleter. The Beardys lived in a single-roomed log cabin but despite the lack of material goods, John Beardy provided the necessities and Beardy appears to have had a happy childhood. He lived with his grandmother, from whom he learned the oral traditions and legends of his Anishinaabe ancestors, for most of his childhood.  Beardy attended residential school at Portage la Prairie in Southern Manitoba at the age of seven. Here, he was separated from his sister and could not communicate with her during the school years. Before attending the school, he did not speak English. Beardy quickly distanced himself from the forced nature of education that all Indigenous peoples in that area underwent at the residential schools, and it was from these lessons that he began to assert his Indigenous culture. Beardy's reaction to the mental de-structuring process at the school was to become the school wit.  It was at the residential school that he learned how to draw and paint. A kind school teacher, Mary Morris, encouraged Beardy's art and stayed in touch with Beardy after he left the school. When drawing at the school, he was not permitted to visually express the Anishinaabe oral narratives.  At the age of 16, the authorities allowed the students to leave the school, however the principal of the residential school promised Beardy an art education if he stayed two more years to gain his high school certificate. Beardy then chose to stay another two years. At the age of 18, Beardy approached the principal to ask for the promised art education, but quickly learned that the principal would not allow him the art education after all. The principal did not believe that being an artist would make Beardy a \"decent\" citizen. Instead, he offered Beardy a course in commercial art, since this would be more economically sustainable. When learning this, young Beardy angrily told him, that he would show him that he is capable of becoming an artist.  During his last year in high school, his grades began to fall and Beardy turned to alcoholism. After failing high school, Beardy still wished to pursue an art education; he completed the failed courses and was accepted into a course on commercial art. He completed these courses at Technical Vocational High School and graduated in 1964. Subsequently, Beardy completed his education at the School of Art at the University of Manitoba in 1966.  Art career Jackson Beardy's first solo exhibition was in 1965 at the University of Winnipeg. He had many subsequent solo exhibitions throughout 1960s and 1970s. In 1967, Beardy was commissioned to create pieces to commemorate the Canadian centennial. That same year he was invited to serve as consultant for the \"Canadian Indian Pavilion\" at Expo 67.  In 1972 Jackson Beardy, Alex Janvier, and Daphne Odjig held a joint exhibition at the Winnipeg Art Gallery titled \"Treaty Numbers 23, 287, 1171\". The name of the piece was a reference to the numbered treaties that were negotiated with the Canadian government of each artist's band. From this 1973 exhibition, a group of Indigenous artists formed the \"Professional Native Indian Artists Association\", better known as the \"Indian Group of Seven\". Included alongside Jackson Beardy was Alex Janvier, Norval Morrisseau, Daphne Odjig, Carl Ray, Eddy Cobiness and Joseph Sanchez. They collaborated to move their work toward larger mainstream acceptance. They committed to maintaining Indigenous control over Indigenous works of art and emphasized artistic rather than anthropological value.  From 1974 through 1976, Beardy contributed artwork to the covers of numerous books including Ojibway Heritage by Basil Johnston, When the Morning Stars Sang Together by John Morgan, and Almighty Voice by Leonard Peterson. Also in 1976, Beardy was one of the contributing artists for a Royal Ontario Museum exhibit called, \"Contemporary Native Art of Canada: The Woodland Indians\" which travelled to Germany and England.  In 1977, Beardy had an exhibition in Vancouver, BC entitled, \"Images for a Canadian Heritage\".  From 1982 through 1983, Jackson Beardy was senior arts advisor for the Federal Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, now known as Indian and Northern Affairs Canada. He developed the \"Indian Fine Arts Guide\" which outlined procedures for the acquisition of Indigenous art. Additionally during this time, he held the position of art advisor and cultural consultant for the Manitoba Museum of Man and Nature.  In 1984, Beardy was commissioned to paint a mural at the intersection of Selkirk and Powers in Winnipeg. The paintings were to depict \"Peace and Harmony\" but Beardy died before he could complete it. It was completed posthumously by students from R.B. Russell Vocational High School. The piece was revealed on September 5, 1985.  In celebration of his body of work, Beardy's art was shown at the Winnipeg Art Gallery from 1993 to 1994. It was again shown in 1995, in an exhibit called \"Jackson Beardy: A Life's Work\" at the Thunder Bay Art Gallery. Beardy's artwork has been displayed in many museums and other notable institutions both domestically and internationally.  Art style Beardy, as well as other members from the Professional Native Indian Artists Incorporated, was a member of the Woodlands School of Indigenous Art. This Woodlands style of artistic expression can be seen in the central role Beardy's Anishinaabe heritage plays within his work. Using a variety of supports, such as canvas, birch bark, and beaver skins, Beardy's artwork often showcases traditional figures from Ojibwe and Cree oral traditions. His art draws on a deep knowledge of his native Cree tradition gained from a close childhood relationship with his grandmother and from his systematic collection of myths and legends in northern Manitoba.  His distinctive graphic style contrasts precise, black outlines with defined areas of rich colour. His art expresses fundamental cosmological and spiritual concepts such as balance in nature, regeneration and growth, and the interdependence of humans and nature.  Death Jackson Beardy died on December 7, 1984 in Winnipeg, Manitoba from complications after a heart attack.  Notes  References  Hughes, Kenneth. The Life and Art of Jackson Beardy.

Outside the safe boundaries of Village is the Forest, an unwelcoming realm that most of the Villagers fear because of its powerful harm. Despite the lack of dangerous beasts, The Forest is animated.   People who trade at a gathering, Trade Mart, change from being compassionate and generous to angry and impatient. The Villagers change temperament and decide to close their borders and stop permitting the displaced and the unwanted of other communities to enter. Seer, in the wake of the sudden change, decides to send Matty to travel through the Forest to retrieve his daughter, Kira, who lives in a town several days away.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Beata Maria Kitsikis Panagopoulos\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Beata Maria Kitsikis Panagopoulos is a emeritus full professor of Art and\u00a0Humanities, born in Athens, Greece, June 27, 1925, residing in the United States since 1947. She was a professor at San Jose State University and retired in 1988.  Early life and education  Daughter and oldest child of three of Nicolas Kitsikis and Beata Merope Petychakis, she\u00a0was born in Athens. Greece. Nicolas Kitsikis was full professor and rector of the National Technical University of Athens (Athens Polytechnic School)  and had served as General\u00a0 Director of Public Works in the government of Eleftherios Venizelos, 1917\u20131920.\u00a0At the time of her birth, he was a technical director for the British company MacAlpine and had, among other projects, built the harbour of Heraklion, Crete.  Beata\u00a0Petychakis, born July 14, 1907, in Heraklion, Crete, was the daughter of Emanuel Petychakis, a Cretan Greek, doing business in Egypt. Beata Petychakis\u00a0married Nicolas Kitsikis at 16 and moved to Athens where Panagopoulos was born. Panagopoulos grew\u00a0up in various places, in central Athens,\u00a0in the suburb of Ekali and eventually, in the neighborhood called Kolonaki.  Panagopoulos finished high school in 1943. During the next two years she studied architecture at the National Technical University of Athens, and archeology at the School of Philosophy, University of Athens (UoA). In February 1947, Panagopoulos left Greece for the United States, where she had received a scholarship to the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago. There she completed both her Bachelor\u2019s degree and Master\u2019s degree in the field of Medieval Art History under Professor Ulrich Middeldorf.  Later life, teaching, and further education  At the University of Chicago, she met a doctoral student, Epaminondas Petros Panagopoulos, (Nondas). They subsequently married and had two children. The family moved first to Detroit, Michigan, where Nondas began teaching at Wayne State University. In 1956, the family moved to San Jose, California, where Nondas taught American History at San Jose State University (SJSU). During this period of time she and Nondas co-authored\u00a0the sections on \u201cModern Culture\u201d in the chapter on \u201cGreece\u201d in the 1958 edition of the Encyclopedia Americana.  Panagopoulos earned teaching certificates in Art and French and began teaching at Fremont High School, Sunnyvale. In 1961, she began teaching Art History at Foothill College. In 1962, she was accepted at Stanford University in the Art History PhD program, but transferred to the University of California, Berkeley\u2019s Art History Department in 1964. Completing her dissertation at the Sorbonne in Paris, she received her PhD in 1970. From then on, she taught at SJSU until 1988.[1]  During this time she was appointed Kress Professor of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, Greece and concurrently served three years as director of the Gennadius Library.  The 1970s, teaching and writing about the humanities   Two major experiences in the 1970\u2019s contributed to the development of Panagopoulos\u2019 teaching philosophy which emphasized the importance of a humanities education. First, at SJSU, she became a professor in the innovative educational four-year program called New College, an intensive study program based on small seminars, exploring important themes of modern life.  The second illustration was Panagopoulos\u2019 tour of China in 1975. This was a tour for educators led by the Chinese government and was part of Mao Zedong\u2019s first efforts to show China to the world. Panagopoulos\u2019 response was enthusiastic and resulted in an article in the UCLA Educator 1976, entitled: On Creativity in the People\u2019s Republic of China, An Art Historian\u2019s Perspective. and in the content of her course on Women and Art at New College  Major work: Frankish monastic architecture in Greece  In 1979, Panagopoulos\u2019 book Cistercian and Mendicant Monasteries in Medieval Greece was published by the University of Chicago Press: This is the only comprehensive study of the most outstanding extant Gothic monasteries built during the French and Italian occupancy of Greece after the conquest of Constantinople in 1204 CE.-- Walter Horn, University of California, Berkeley In Cistercian and Mendicant Monasteries in Medieval Greece, Panagopoulos examined\u00a0the development of  Latin ecclesiastical architecture in Greece. She provided new data, including photographs and drawings. In the past this subject area had been too difficult for medievalists and art historians to access. Google Scholar provides citations to 43 scholars that have in turn referred to this work.  Kress Professor and director of the Gennadius Library  In 1982, Panagopoulos was awarded the position of Kress Professor at the American School of Classical Studies in Athens (ASCSA) and in July 1983, was made\u00a0the director of the American School\u2019s Gennadius Library,\u00a0a collection of Greek history, literature and art from antiquity to modern times and part of the ASCSA. This was a notable appointment since the library had not had a director since 1977. She served in this position until July 1986. During her watch, the Gennadius Library\u00a0opened for additional hours and two evenings a week leading to a substantial increase in the number of people using the library. The physical structure of the library was remodeled. A new\u00a0exhibition room and a section for archival research were added to the building.  Under Panagopoulos\u2019 leadership the following of the library increased substantially.\u00a0The\u00a0monthly\u00a0 lectures, chamber music concerts and exhibits grew in popularity. The library had an exhibit on the literary activities in Thessaloniki, another on the treasures of Mt. Sinai and the Patriarchate of Alexandria and a third on the achievements of the American School of Classical Studies in Athens. In 1985 Athens was selected as the European Capital of Culture and the Gennadius Library fully participated in events throughout the year. The library was part of five exhibitions and in addition contributed substantially to a television program on the life of Joannes Gennadius.  Turco-Baroque domestic architecture  During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Panagopoulos did her own research and synthesized fragmented studies\u00a0surrounding certain large mansions (Greek: \u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac) built in Greece and the remaining Balkans between 1700 and 1900. Her work recognized\u00a0as an emerging class\u00a0the owners of these mansions who were merchants dealing in products\u2014leather, wax, fabrics\u2014from the Ottoman Empire for sale in lucrative European markets like Madrid, Vienna and Venice. This class of merchants was secure in their language and their religion but did not have fixed commitments as to their ethnicity. They would leave at the beginning of\u00a0 spring and return home\u00a0at the beginning of\u00a0 the winter.\u00a0Slowly they became rich and built homes using itinerant builders mostly from Greece\u2019s Epirus and western Macedonia regions.  Awards  In 1982 Panagopoulos received, in Greece, the Academy of Athens annual award for the humanities. In addition, in the United States, in 1992, she received the Hellenic American Professional Society of California's  Axion Award.  Personal  Panagopoulos\u2019 husband of 48 years was Epaminondas Petros Panagopoulos. They had two children. Panagopoulos\u00a0retired in 1988 from SJSU and has spent the remaining years living in San Francisco and traveling frequently.  Publications  Panagopoulos, Beata Kitsikis (1979).

It is located in a provincial nature reserve, the Riserva Naturale orientata Cavagrande del Cassibile, about 1.5 kilometers (0.93 mi) south of the town of Gela. The site consists of a large artificial cave, with a roughly rectangular shape, measuring 60 by 40 meters (200 by 130 ft), with a height of 3 to 4 meters (9.5 to 13.1 ft). The entrance is 4 meters (13.1 ft) high and 2 meters (6.5 ft) wide. The interior is divided into two large rooms and a corridor that connects them. The cave has been dated to the early Bronze Age, with the pottery sherds found on the floor of the cave dated to between 2500 and 1600 BC. The cave was formed by digging into the calcareous rock, using stone tools. The same rock was then used to build the interior walls, which were smoothed and plastered. The floor was covered with a pinkish mortar. The finds from the cave include stone tools, pottery, and a bronze dagger. The items date from the early Bronze Age through the early Iron Age. The cave may have been used as a shelter, as a place to live, to hold meetings, or to perform religious rituals. The bronze dagger may have been an offering to the gods. The site was abandoned at the end of the Bronze Age, and never reused. In 2022, the site was declared a monument of cultural interest by the Sicilian regional government.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 27357601}

Based in Mayag\u00fcez, Puerto Rico, El Meson Sandwiches is Puerto Rico's largest restaurant chain. In 2012 it was named one of the world's top fast food chains by Travel & Leisure magazine.  El Meson Sandwiches is family-owned and operated. It has 37 locations in Puerto Rico and three in Florida, at the Florida Mall, in Kissimmee and Lee Vista Promenade.  El Meson began franchising in 2018. El Meson Sandwiches units average $2 million in sales per year. System-wide sales in 2015 were just under $80 million.  History  The first El Meson Sandwiches opened in 1972 in the beach town of Aguadilla on Puerto Rico's northwestern tip. The restaurant was started by Felipe Perez Sr., father of the current CEO, Felipe P\u00e9rez Grajales. The original restaurant was known primarily for two things: home-style sandwiches and a familial atmosphere.  Many of El Meson's early customers were American surfers who came early in the day asking for big, healthy breakfasts. Their requests prompted Perez Sr. to create a sandwich dubbed The Surfer, which comes stuffed with fresh vegetables and soy-based protein. The second Puerto Rico location opened in 1987, shortly after the younger Perez returned from college in Jacksonville, Florida. Rapid growth followed.  Products  El Meson sandwiches are mostly served on criollo bread, a sweet, French-style bread with a Caribbean flavor. Most are pressed on a hot grill and served with cabbage, tomatoes, and mayo. The Delicioso sandwich comes with turkey and bacon. The White House is grilled with roast beef, turkey and mushrooms. El Meson also serves sandwiches on baked potatoes.  Current leadership  Felipe P\u00e9rez Grajales is the current CEO of El Meson Sandwiches. He was born in 1965, the eldest of three brothers. From the early 1970s through his high school years, Grajales worked in the original El Meson restaurant in Aguadilla. In 1983 he left Puerto Rico to attend Jacksonville University. Though he received several offers from companies in the U.S., he returned to Puerto Rico in 1986 to help expand the family business.  Grajales has been recognized as an outstanding businessman by Ernst & Young, the Puerto Rico Chamber of Commerce, the Sales & Marketing Executives (SME) Association, and the House of Representatives and Senate of Puerto Rico.  He was president of the Organizing Committee for the 2010 Central American and Caribbean Games in Mayag\u00fcez in 2010 and is president of the Mayag\u00fcez 2010 Foundation.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Wesley O. Smith\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Wesley Oliver Smith (April 16, 1878October 20, 1951), commonly known as W. O. Smith, was an American newspaper publisher and businessman from southern Oregon.  He owned the Klamath Republican and later the Evening Herald, both Klamath Falls newspapers.  Smith was a Republican who served two two-year terms in the Oregon House of Representatives, representing what are today Crook, Deschutes, Grant, Jefferson, Klamath, and Lake counties.  Early life   Smith was born on April 16, 1878 in French Lake, an unincorporated area of New Brunswick, Canada.  He was the son of George F. Smith and Anna Smith.  His family left Canada and moved to Eau Claire, Wisconsin, when he was eight years old.  In 1895, Governor William H. Upham commissioned Smith as a second lieutenant in the Wisconsin National Guard.  He served in Company E of the Third Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry from the time of his commissioning to August 1897.  Company E was based in Eau Claire.  With the onset of the Spanish\u2013American War, Smith rejoined the Wisconsin National Guard as a non-commissioned officer.  He served as first sergeant for Company E.  After the war, Smith moved to Harrison, Idaho, where he briefly worked cruising timber before moving on to Klamath Falls, Oregon.  Life in Klamath Falls   In Klamath Falls, Smith worked for a short time in the lumber business. Then in 1903, he bought the Klamath Republican from W. Huse and Sons.  The Klamath Republican was a weekly newspaper that had been published in Klamath Falls since 1896.  When he took charge of the paper, Klamath Falls had five newspapers competing for reads in a community of only 3,000 people.  Smith married Jessie Applegate on December 11, 1904.  She was the youngest daughter of Captain Ivan D. Applegate, an early Klamath County pioneer.  Nine months later, she died in Klamath Falls, three days after giving birth to a son.  Smith married his second wife, Lena L. Hargus, on October 24, 1906.  She was the widow of Doctor H. B. Hargus, and was also the sister of Smith\u2019s first wife.  They remained together for the rest of his life.  In 1908, Smith acquired another Klamath Falls newspaper, the Evening Herald (now the Herald and News), from its founder Fred Cronemiller.  After buying the Evening Herald, he purchased and installed a new Linotype machine, the first automated typesetting machine in the Klamath Falls area.  Under his management, the Evening Herald became the area\u2019s leading newspaper.  Smith continued to publish the Klamath Republican along with the Herald.  He eventually changed the Klamath Republican from a weekly to a semi-weekly publication.  In 1914, he merged it in to the Evening Herald as a semi-weekly supplement.  Smith also started a printing business in Klamath Falls.  His printing firm was called W. O. Smith Printing Company.  While it was separate from his newspaper, it was located in the same building as the Evening Herald.  Smith was also a prominent member of the Klamath Falls community.  He was active in civic affairs and local politics.  He helped finance construction of the local Odd Fellows building, the first large office building in Klamath Falls.  He also joined the local Elks lodge and helped raise funds to build the Klamath Falls Elks building.  Smith later served as president of the local Elks lodge.  In politics, he was a strong supporter of the Republican Party, serving as a recording clerk for the Klamath Falls voting precinct and then as chairman of the Klamath County Republican Central Committee.  State representative   In 1912, Smith decided to run as a Republican for a District 21 seat in the Oregon House of Representatives.  At that time, District 21 had two seats that represented Grant, Klamath, and Lake counties as well as Crook County (which at that time, still included what are now Deschutes and Jefferson counties).  Smith and Vernon A. Forbes of Bend were the only Republicans to file for the District 21 seats. Since the Republican Party was allowed to nominate two candidates for the two District 21 seats, Smith and Forbes were both nominated in the Republican primary.  Since no Democratic candidates filed for the District 21 seats, Smith and Forbes were unopposed in the general election.  Smith took his seat in the Oregon House of Representatives on January 13, 1913, representing District 21.  He worked through the 1913 legislative session which ended on March 5.  During the session, he served on the powerful ways and means committee as well as the irrigation committee.  Later in the session, Smith was appointed to a special committee assigned to investigate conditions in Oregon\u2019s state prisons.  Smith was an active member of the House throughout the session.  A fiscal conservative, Smith successfully pushed a bill through the legislature that standardized government accounting within the state.  After the session, he received special recognition from eastern Oregon farmers for his work on the irrigation committee.  In 1914, Smith decided to run for re-election, seeking to retain his District 21 House seat.  He was joined by fellow incumbent Republican, Vernon Forbes.  There were also two candidates running in the Democratic primary, P. H. Dencer of Bend and Fred W. Hyndman of Klamath Falls.  Since there were two District 21 seats available both parties could nominate two candidates for the general election.  As a result, all four candidates were advanced to the general election.  In the November election, Smith and Forbes retained their House seats.  The final general election tally was 1,366 votes for Smith, 1,157 votes for Forbes, 982 votes for Hyndman, and 742 votes for Dencer.  Smith began his second term representing House District 21 on January 11, 1915. The session lasted six weeks, ending on February 20.  During the session, Smith was appointed to the ways and means, irrigation, military affairs, and printing committees.  In 1916, Smith ran for a third term in the Oregon House of Representatives.  Since the 1914 election, Jefferson County had been separated from Crook County and Deschutes County was in the process of being created.  While these changes did not alter the boundaries of District 21, it did add two new counties to the district.  While Smith and Forbes had been the only two Republicans to file for the District 21 seats in the past two elections, two additional Republicans decided to join the field in 1916.  The two new Republican candidates were Denton G. Burdick of Redmond and Albert E. Elder of Klamath Falls.  In addition, Fred Hyndman filed as a Democrat.  In the Republican primary, Forbes and Burdick were advanced to the general election while Hyndman was nominated in the Democratic primary.  In 1920 and 1922, several Oregon newspapers identified Smith as a possible candidate for one of the District 21 seats.  However, he did not run for state office again.  Later life   After his 1916 primary defeat, Governor James Withycombe appointed Smith as Oregon\u2019s delegate to the International Farm Congress and the International Irrigation Congress.  Both meetings were held in El Paso, Texas, in October 1916.  In 1920, Smith sold the Evening Herald to E. J. Murray so he could focus on his commercial printing business.  He modernized the company's printing operation, acquiring a new press with an automatic press feeder system.  In 1926, Smith moved his business to a new modern building in downtown Klamath Falls. Four years later, W. O. Smith Printing Company merged with Drummond Printing of Klamath Falls.  The new business brought together a full suite of modern printing equipment under one roof.  The company was incorporated in 1929 as Smith-Bates.  It was capitalized at $50,000 with 500 shares valued at $100 per share.  Smith and his wife were primary shareholders.  Instead of returning to state politics, Smith ran for a city council position in Klamath Falls.  He was elected and took his seat in 1921.  He served two terms on the city council.  After leaving the council, he continued to serve Klamath Falls as chairman of the city\u2019s budget committee.  In 1930, the city of Klamath Fall decided to update its city charter.  Smith was appointed chairman of the 15-person committee that evaluated various options for improving the city\u2019s government.  His committee recommended the city adopt a new form of government based on a city manager structure.  Smith also remained involved in fraternal and civic affairs.  He was active in the local Elks lodge.  He helped establish a Boy Scout program in Klamath Falls.  Smith was also a founding member of the local Rotary club and was that organization\u2019s first president. In addition, he served as president and trustee of the local golf country club.    Due to an extended illness, Smith was confined to his home for the last six years of his life.  He died at his home in Klamath Falls on October 20, 1951 at the age 73.  His funeral service was held at the Klamath Falls Elks lodge on October 23, 1951.  Smith was buried in the Linkville Cemetery in Klamath Falls.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Rhinoceros auklet\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The rhinoceros auklet (Cerorhinca monocerata) is a seabird and a close relative of the puffins. It is the only extant species of the genus Cerorhinca. Given its close relationship with the puffins, the common name rhinoceros puffin has been proposed for the species.  It ranges widely across the North Pacific, feeding on small fish and nesting in colonies. Its name is derived from a horn-like extension of the beak (the anatomic term for this extension is the rhamphotheca). This horn is only present in breeding adults, and like the elaborate sheath on the bill of puffins is shed every year. This horn also processes fluorescent properties, which is likely involved in reproductive signalling.  The rhinoceros auklet (also known as the rhino auklet, horn-billed puffin, or unicorn puffin), is a medium-sized auk with a large, strong, orange/brown bill (with the 'horn' protruding from it). The plumage is dark on top and paler below; breeding adults (both male and female) possess white plumes above the eyes and behind the bill. Males are slightly larger than females (about 10% in mass).  Distribution The rhinoceros auklet is a North Pacific auk that breeds from California (the Channel Islands) to the Aleutian Islands in Alaska in North America; and Hokkaid\u014d and Honsh\u016b, Japan, as well as the Korean Peninsula and Sakhalin Island in Asia. It winters both in offshore and inshore waters, exhibiting some migration. Between October and April, migration of a large number occurs on pelagic California waters, most coming from breeding colonies north of California. Auks that reside off the California coast remain in their areas.  Breeding Breeding occurs in the early summer months, ranging from May to June. The auklet nests in burrows dug into the soil, or in natural caves and cavities between 1 and 5 m deep. It prefers nesting sites on slight inclines to aid take-off, as it is a poor flier. A single egg is incubated by both parents for 30\u201335 days. The semiprecocial chick is then fed each night with a bill full of fish (in the manner of puffins) for 35\u201345 days. This nocturnal behaviour is believed to be a response to predation and kleptoparasitism by gulls.  Rhinoceros Auklets are monogamous, and although they migrate across similar areas during the non-breeding season, pair-mates migrate separately. However, they do synchronize their foraging activity once they return to the colony during the pre-laying period.  Feeding At sea, rhinoceros auklets feed on fish, with some krill and squid taken also. They feed inshore during the breeding season in the midwater.  To catch their prey, they dive as deep as 57 meters (187\u00a0ft) for as long as 148 seconds.  Diet studies of nesting rhinoceros auklets show that their diet is variable depending on the location of the bird's nest. At one island located near the Salish Sea off of the Washington coast, auklets feed mainly on sand lance, while at a separate island also off of the Washington coast, auklets feed on anchovy and smelt.  Evolution and prehistoric species The genus Cerorhinca evolved in the North Pacific, apparently in the mid-late Miocene. Although today only one species remains, it used to be much more diverse, both in number of species and in distribution. Fossils have been found as far south as Baja California. The first record of the clade from the Atlantic Ocean was reported by Smith et al. (2007) and suggests that the biogeographic history of Cerorhinca is more complex than previously thought. Known prehistoric species are:   Dubious auklet, Cerorhinca dubia L. H. Miller, 1925 (Late Miocene of San Barbara County, USA)  Cerorhinca minor Howard, 1971 (Late Miocene/Early Pliocene of Cedros Island, Mexico)  Cerorhinca reai Chandler, 1990 (San Diego Late Pliocene, North American Southwest)  Cerorhinca aurorensis N. A. Smith, 2011, a nomen nudum, only published in a PhD dissertation (Yorktown Formation Late Pliocene, North Carolina, USA)  Cerorhinca sp. (Early Pliocene, Southeastern Woodlands)  Bill fluorescence  Since rhinoceros auklets are monogamous and highly social, the species depend heavily on physical characteristics of the other species in order to choose a lifetime mate. The prominent horn on the bill of breeding rhinoceros auklet is one evolutionary byproduct of this behavior. Also, the bill interestingly has fluorescent characteristics when viewed under ultraviolet light. Several bird species are able to detect cues through UV light, which supports the claim that this fluorescence is also meant for breeding purposes. While the upper and lower mandible give off fluorescence as well, this phenomenon is most prominent in the horn. There is no evidence for disparity of fluorescence between sexes, however, the amount of fluorescence does vary between individual auks.

It is one of three species of auklets in the genus Cerorhinca, and one of 21 species in the Alcidae family. The rhinoceros auklet is found from the Aleutian Islands in Alaska to the Sea of Okhotsk in Russia. It occurs as a breeder in Russia, North Korea, South Korea, China, and Japan; and as a winter migrant to the North Pacific coast of North America from Alaska to Baja California. It has also been recorded from Taiwan. The rhinoceros auklet is named for its distinctive horn-like bill. It is 20\u201323 cm (7.9\u20139.1 in) in length and weighs 100\u2013400 g (3.5\u201314 oz). It has a dark greyish-brown head, pale greyish-brown upperparts, and white underparts. The feet and legs are pale grey. The male and female are similar in appearance. The rhinoceros auklet feeds at night on small crustaceans and marine worms. It nests in colonies on islands and coastal headlands in Russia and North America. It winters in the open ocean and in protected coastal waters. The rhinoceros auklet is the subject of a conservation effort by BirdLife International. Although the species' population is currently stable, there is a lack of information on its population size, and it is believed to be at risk of becoming endangered.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1317988}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Local Journalism Sustainability Act\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Local Journalism Sustainability Act () is a bill introduced into the United States House of Representatives on July 16, 2020, by Representative Ann Kirkpatrick (D-AZ-2). On November 12, it received another co-sponsor bringing the total to 78 (20 Republicans and 58 Democrats).  This act would provide tax credits to support local newspapers:     Up to $250 per year per individual to cover 80 percent of subscription fees to local newspapers for the first tax year and 50 percent for subsequent tax years (4-1 match the first year, 1-1 match for an additional four years).  Up to $12,500 per quarter ($50,000 per year) to reduce employment taxes for a local newspaper to hire and pay journalists.  Up to $5,000 per year for a small business to cover 80 percent of advertising with local media (local newspapers or broadcast stations) the first year after this act takes effect and up to $2,500 per year for another four years to cover 50 percent of such advertising.     This act defines a \u2018local newspaper\u2019 as any print or digital publication whose (A) primary content is news and current events, and (B) at least 51 percent of its readers (including both print and digital versions) reside in a single (i) State or a single possession of the United States, or (ii) area with a 200-mile radius.  To qualify, a 'local newspaper' must have been in continuous operation for two years prior to the enactment of this bill.  The bill was reintroduced to the 117th congress in 2021 ( and ).  Discussion    On July 21, 2020, The Arizona Republic discussed this bill, noting that, \u201cMore than 150 news companies and papers have undergone pay cuts, furloughs, layoffs or even shut their doors for good as a result of the pandemic, according to the Poynter Institute, a journalism think tank.\" More recent reports from the Poynter Institute document further reductions in news.   The bill is supported by multiple organizations concerned about the decline of local newspapers and the threat that poses to democracy.   David Chavern, the President and CEO of News Media Alliance, wrote, \"As journalists are on the front lines reporting on the coronavirus crisis, ... local news publishers have been dealt a major blow from the contraction of the local advertising market. The Local Journalism Sustainability Act ... would help ensure local news publishers survive the current crises, and that they are around to cover the next ones.\"   Dean Ridings, CEO of America\u2019s Newspapers, reminded readers of what happened to Bell, California, a suburb of Los Angeles with only 37,000 people of modest incomes, after its local newspaper died in 1998 or shortly thereafter:  When the Los Angeles Times started reporting on it in  2010, the city was almost bankrupt in spite of major tax increases, because the city council had voted huge increases in annual compensation to roughly $100,000 for council members, $450,000 for the police chief, and almost $800,000 for the city manager.   Other supporters include Editor & Publisher, an American monthly magazine serving the newspaper industry, and the Hoosier State Press Association.   Jack Shafer, who writes about media for Politico, said, \u201cNobody will miss newspapers more than me when they finally vanish.\u201d However, publishers and journalist may not honestly report on certain issues and events, given the history of politicians (usually Republicans like Mr. Trump) threatening to defund NPR and PBS when they don't like the coverage. He asked, \"You wouldn't put a dead man on a ventilator, would you?\" Editor and Publisher Magazine took position to Shafer's opinions about the eventual death of newspapers in a 2020 editorial penned by Publisher Mike Blinder, which stated \"there are thousands of smaller community newspapers that are still operating with decent profits and serving their communities that lack other news outlets.\" And went on to cite: \"Community publishers generally operate with much more efficiencies than the big market dailies and have better relationships with the local advertising community. Plus, they perform a necessary, critical service (as mandated in the Constitution) of making the local government accountable to the people they serve, or as some say: \u201cSpeak truth to power.\u201d These are the cities and counties that must continue to have an authoritative, credible voice through this crisis and beyond.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Bura Irrigation and Settlement Project (Kenya)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "In 1977 the Board of Governors of the World Bank approved Bura Irrigation and Settlement Project (BISP) in Kenya. The project area is situated just South of the Equator in the Lower Tana Basin. It lies on the west bank of the Tana River and falls within the administrative area of Tana River County.  The project was an ambitious attempt of the government of Kenya, the World Bank and a few other donors to develop a remote area, create employment for thousands of people with a reasonable income and earn foreign exchange.  Bura project would develop about 6,700 net irrigated ha over a 5 \u00bd year period and settle on smallholdings about 5,150 landless poor families selected from all parts of Kenya. Physical and social infrastructure would be provided to support the settler and satellite population, expected to reach a total of 65,000 persons by 1985. The total cost of the project was estimated at 92 million dollars in 1977 prices. Actual construction started in 1978. During implementation the costs exploded from $17,500/= per family to $55,000/=, a new record for the World Bank. The largest cost increase was for the irrigation network (615%). The donors were not willing and the government was not able to raise the additional funds and subsequently the size of the project was scaled down from 6,700 ha to 3,900 and later to 2,500 ha, although the irrigation structures were completed for 6,700 ha. In this period 2,100 landless households from all over Kenya were settled in the scheme. They were allocated two plots of 0.625 ha and a garden of 0.05 ha. Each year they were to grow 1.25 ha cotton and 0.625 maize intercropped with cowpeas. Soon it was evident that the project would fail to achieve its objectives. Job creation was only 40% of the target, the economic rate of return was negative and the annual operating and maintenance costs exceeded the benefits. Even with net farm incomes of about 40% of the appraisal estimates in real terms, annual government subsidies amounted to about 1,000 dollars per settler. The project had an unreliable water supply and many buildings had foundation problems. After cotton crop failures due to pests in 1990 the project came virtually to a standstill as the management lacked the funds to finance cotton and maize crops. Most settlers deserted and the only the ones with nowhere to go remained in the scheme, living on famine relief and odd jobs.  In the period 1993-2005 a number of times the government tried to revive a number of timesthe project, but all in vain. After 2005, rehabilitation and crop growing started in phases and since 2009-10 the tenants have been growing crops, although the cropping pattern comed down to no more than 50% of the projected crop intensity and the settlers have low incomes, if any. This is partly caused by the fact that the original cash crop, cotton, is no longer a profitable crop.  Background  During the later 1930s and 1940s the colonial government was already concerned about population pressure and soil erosion. Irrigation was seen as a means to reduce land pressure and the Tana River Basin was seen as the natural area to start irrigated settlements. As early as 1934 Harris and Sampson published their \u2018Report on the Tana River Expedition\u2019. In 1948 the colonial government published a study on two 40,000 ha schemes between Bura and Grand Falls. Due to the remoteness and poor soils these projects were uneconomic. In 1956 the government started Hola Pilot Irrigation Project about 40\u00a0km south of Bura. From 1963 to 1967 the FAO oversaw the Lower Tana River Basin study. This study was carried out by Ilaco and Acres (two engineering firms) and they proposed to start an irrigation project of minimally 100,000 ha. However, with an economic rate of return of 10% the study showed that the project was economically marginal. One recommendation was to start a research and training centre. Later it was decided that this centre should be a pilot project at Bura and Ilaco was given a contract to carry out a feasibility study. That study, as was the case with most Ilaco studies, was financed by the Netherlands.  Studies and appraisal  Ilaco feasibility studies In 1973 Ilaco presented its first feasibility study on Bura. It proposed to develop 4,000 ha for 3,000 tenants. The economic rate of return was calculated at 13.5%. In the meantime feasibility studies in other areas in Kenya had shown disappointed rate of returns for irrigation projects and the Government of Kenya, therefore, proposed that Ilaco makes an even more detailed study for 14,000 ha so that a project that was eligible for financing by the World Bank could be produced. In 1975 Ilaco submitted its report. This report became the basis of the project that eventually materialized. This study envisaged the settlement of 11,000 families on 14,000 ha. The implementation period would take 11 \u00bd years and the economic rate of return was calculated at 16%. Although the report raised some questions about the quality of the soils, the Ilaco feasibility study was optimistic and foresaw a bright future for the area.  Appraisal by the World Bank Late 1975 a World Bank appraisal mission visited Kenya and in June 1976 the first appraisal report (White Cover) was presented. The document proposed a 14,000 ha project with an economic rate of return of 11%. Internally the World Bank had classified Bura as a \"potential difficult and contentious project\" because of the level of external financing, incomplete preparation, high cost per family, cost recovery, remote area and settler selection. Interesting enough the soils were not seen as a problem, but a few months after the publication of the White Cover report this issue erupted, when World Bank staff reviewed the details of the soil studies and concluded that the classification of these soils by Ilaco was too optimistic and not justified.  With the appraisal on the verge of collapse, a phased development programme was proposed. Phase I consisted of a project of 6,700 ha with mainly good soils, but also with poorer soils (31%) in order to gain practical experiences with these soils. If the poorer soils proved to have potential, then phase II of about 6,000 ha with poorer soils would be developed. At this moment the World Bank also introduced Stage II, which was for about 25,000 ha irrigation development on the east bank of the Tana River. Under normal circumstances the consultants who prepared the feasibility study and the designs would automatically be engaged to supervise the construction. However, the World Bank was not satisfied with the work of Ilaco and insisted on tendering for the position of project consultants. In December 1976 a British consortium, Sir M. MacDonald and Partners and Associated Firms was appointed. Part of the job of the firm was to prepare an implementation report (Project Planning Report), review the Ilaco studies, reformulate the project at a reduced scale and provide essential data to the appraisal report. Indeed, the new consultants confirmed the cost estimates given by the World Bank.  The new proposal envisaged 6,700 ha irrigated land for 5,150 landless families from all parts of Kenya. The plan was to construct a diversion structure on the Tana River 46\u00a0km above the project. A principal town and 23 villages were to be built along with education, social and administrative facilities and the physical infrastructure (roads, water, electricity) for a population of 65,000 people. Settlers were allocated tenancies of 1,3 ha of which 1,25 ha were for field crops and 0,05 for garden vegetables. An ingenious cropping pattern would make it possible for the tenants to grow 1,25 ha cotton and 0,625 ha maize intercropped with cow peas each year. The total cost of the project was US $91,7 m (Kshs 766 m). Financiers were the IBRD (US $34m), IDA (US $ 6m), EDF (US $12m), Netherlands (US $8,8m), ODM (US$8,5m) and CDC (US $8,5m). The remaining US $20,6 m was to be financed by Kenya. The tenants were to earn Kshs 7,000 (US $840) yearly and the economic rate of return was calculated at 13%.  The National Irrigation Board (NIB) would be overall responsible for the implementation of the project. However, the World Bank argued that its experience and implementation capacity was limited and therefore experienced consultants should be employed to complete the design, supervise the construction and assist in coordination of all activities.  Project Planning Report  In September 1977, after many delays the new consultants submitted part of the six volumes comprising Project Planning Report (PPR). Even though the consortium had confirmed the World Bank estimates (based on the Ilaco studies) before the appraisal report was published, MacDonald and partners gave a total cost of US $112,1m (Kshs936 m), an increase of 22%. The cost increase was largely due to much higher consultancy cost and, to a lesser extent, the irrigation works. This surprised, if not shocked, Kenya and the other financiers. Two months after the appraisal, the project was thus already seriously underfunded. Surprisingly, despite the higher cost, the economic rate of return of the project remained at 13%.  One feature of the Project Planning Report was that it linked the implementation of Stages I and II. For instance, the river diversion structure was to be redesigned so that it could serve both Stages. This despite the fact that there existed very little evidence that Stage II could be a viable project.  Comparison of key documents  A comparison of the unit costs from 1975-1977 gives the following:  In its studies Ilaco argued that a cost increase of 10% would lower the economic rate of return with one percentage point. As the table above shows, however, cost increases of 600% resulted only in a minor change of the economic rate of return. The following parameters were changed to keep the economic rate of return, despite huge cost increases, at an acceptable level:  Shadow pricing of the Kshs at a value of 11 Kshs as compared with the official dollar rate at that time of 8.35.  Shortening the implementation period.   Huge increases in the yield of the main crops in the early years even though there was no new evidence that could justify such increases.  Defining a number of investment cost as non-project and hence excluding them, at least partly, from the cost benefit analysis. For instance, the World Bank defined only 75% of the social infrastructure as project costs.   Many other, often minor changes, which almost always resulted in a higher rate of return.  In the PPR, apart from changing other parameters, the consultant introduced a completely new method of retaining the rate of return of the project at an acceptable level by apportioning investments to Stage I, phase II and Stage II. By claiming, for instance, that the river diversion works could serve an area of 37 000 on both the east and the west bank, it attributed only 6,700 ha (18%) to Stage I, phase I. At various places it has been pointed out that there existed no methodological justification for this way of calculating the internal rate of return. If phase II and Stage II would ever be implemented, then the remaining 82% of the cost of the diversion weir would have been defined as sunk cost and also not be included in the cost benefit analysis. By excluding them now, these costs would never be included in any cost benefit analysis.  Implementation  Major design changes Whereas the formal agreements between Kenya and the World Bank were signed in June 1977 the implementation was delayed due to a number of factors. Firstly Kenya and the consultants needed about 10 months before they could agree on a new consultancy contract. The outcome of these negotiations was that the consultancy cost almost doubled. Secondly, during the preparation of the final designs, major modifications were made by the consultants on both the intake and the irrigation structure. These changes caused not only new delays, but also, for instance, an increase of concrete structures in the main canal with 138%, stone pitching with 338% and digging with 255%. In 1979 the World Bank concluded that both the original design of Ilaco and MacDonald\u2019s design were based on sound engineering principles. Rejection of the new design would have resulted in further delays and fearing further delays the World Bank accepted the new design. According to the World Bank, however, design changes would result in a cost increase of 65% in real terms. At that time the economic rate of return of the project was at best 4%.  Also one of the financiers (CDC) withdrew and as a result of this the part to be financed by Kenya, depending on the project formulation, increased to between 50 and 65% in real terms of the total project cost.  Construction  Project construction began in mid 1979, two years late, and by mid 1982 construction was about three years behind schedule. During construction the cost continued to escalate and in September 1982 the Bank calculated an increase of 87% for the base cost. If the cost increases due to delays were included, the total cost had at least trebled. Huge cost increases were registered for the construction the tenant houses and the domestic waste supply. At the same time studies on the quality of the soils on the East Bank showed that these soils were so poor that further investigations were no longer justified and the idea of a stage II was shelved.  Financial crises In this period the local inflation rate climbed and this was accompanied by a fall in the value of the Kenyan Shilling. Together with the cost escalation, the part which Kenya had to finance grew bigger and bigger and this alarmed the government. A few new donors (Finnida and the World Food Programme) committed funds, but these funds amounted only to a few million dollars. Also OPEC and Kuwait committed funds for the intake and the ginnery, but since their funding financed only part of these components, these funds did not solve the crisis but would actually increase it. Subsequently, a special government committee was established to control the cost. The committee advised, following earlier advice from the consultants, to postpone and later to cancel the river intake structure. A temporary pumping station designed to operate for a few years, pending the completion of the river works, would become permanent. Other project components, e.g. the ginnery, were also cancelled. To further reduce the cost, the quantity and quality of the houses and roads was reduced. The forest component of the project was drastically trimmed down from 3,900 ha to 650 ha. All the cost saving measures still did not reduce the financial burden for the government of Kenya to an acceptable level and the government decided to reduce the project area to 3,900ha and later to 2,500ha. After these decisions the Bura project still took about 40% yearly of the investment budget of the Ministry of Agriculture.  Especially the decision to cancel the river works was later criticised as this would jeopardise the supply of water to the project. However, in 1979 the consultants had calculated that a project with a pumping station would have a much lower capital cost and, subsequently, a much higher rate of return than a project with a gravity intake. The implicit recommendation was that a gravity intake was not only very costly, but also unnecessary. This conclusion was embraced by the government and subsequently it shelved the gravity intake. However, there was serious catch in this, which was not included in the analysis of the consultant: the high, projected yields of cotton and maize were partly based on the fact that the project had a gravity and thus a secure supply of irrigation water. Therefore, when calculating the rate of return for the project with a pumping station the consultants should have used lower yields for cotton and maize in their economic analysis. They did not do this and in this way they got the advantages of both gravity (higher yields) and pumping (low investment costs).  Project completion The final project consisted of 2,500 ha and some parts were done for more than 75% (water supply, irrigation network, supply, main and branch canals and the NIB offices). Other parts were done for about 1/3 (primary schools, health facilities, tenant houses). Important components as the cotton ginnery, river diversion structure, feasibility study East Bank, housing for teachers, social halls and the 132 KV transmission line were not implemented. Despite all the omissions and reductions the final cost of the project was estimated by the World Bank at 105 million dollars or 1,180 million Kshs. With a cost of Kshs 472,000 ($55,000) per ha the project became a new high for the World Bank. The World Bank considered the project completed in 1988.  Sunk cost During the financial crises economic reviews were published regularly. In all economic reviews an acceptable economic rate of return and thus, in the eyes of the reviewers, a viable project, was presented to the financiers based on sunk-costs principles, that is to say that already invested funds and commitments were excluded from the cost-benefit analysis. Such an analysis, however, easily disguises serious underlying problems. In the case of Bura all the reviews showed also that after the investment period, the project would still need a considerable annual subsidy from the government. In the most thorough and realistic review this subsidy was calculated at about Ksh20 million. The project was also very sensitive to changes in the project cost and yields. The same study also showed that the close-down of the project was possible for a one-off amount of Ksh 40 million. For different reasons the various parties never saw closing down the project as an option.  Settlement of tenants While priority was given to local inhabitants, tenants for Bura were drawn from all parts of Kenya. They had to meet the following criteria: heads of households must be aged between 25 and 45 years and preferably married, must be landless, unemployed or underemployed or earn an income below the minimum agricultural wage, must be medically and physically fit, must provide the equivalent of four adult labour units, must be of good character and should have a rural or farming background. Late 1981 the first group of about 330 settlers arrived and by mid 1984 the total number of tenants living in the scheme was 1,802. They came from Coast Province (35%), Central (24%), Eastern (13%), Nyanza (8%), Western (8%), Rift Valley (6%) and others (6%). In 1988 the number of tenants was estimated at 2,139. Life at Bura was difficult for the tenants and desertion rates in the period 1981-1984 were estimated at between 20-30%.  The NIB provided the tenants with housing, transport, food, tools and a subsistence advance of Kshs 300 per month for incoming tenants until the first cash crop was harvested. The tenants repaid this advance over a period of three years. When the tenants arrived, often the farm land was not ready and this resulted in late planting, low cotton yields and thus low incomes.  Production  Early years From 1977 till 1985 the project was governed by the National Irrigation Board (NIB). During this period the World Bank and other donors had a low opinion of the NIB's management of Bura and their pressure resulted into a transfer of the project from the NIB to the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development in 1985. After 1989 it was transferred to other ministries. and in 2005 it was reverted to the NIB. When Bura resorted under ministries as a kind of semi-independent department, usually the NIB fell also under this ministry. The main difference was that the NIB had a parastatal status and Bura Project lacked this protection. Hence whenever Bura moved to a new ministry, it had to fight for accounting privileges as a \u2018production\u2019 unit. The existing accounting procedures within ministries were rarely conducive for a smooth operation of the production unit Bura, .  Every tenant was allocated two plots of 0.625 ha and a garden of 0.05 ha. Each year the tenants were to grow 1.25 ha cotton (main season) and 0.625 maize intercropped with cowpeas (off-season). After the fourth year 0.2 ha of the maize would be replaced with the much more profitable groundnuts. The cropping pattern of 148% was very tight as together the maize and cotton crops needed almost a year in the field and thus there was very little time left for land preparation. To solve this problem an ingenious cropping system was developed in which each tenant had two plots. On one plot he would plant early cotton (1 February) and after harvesting the cotton he would plant maize and harvest maize. Next year, this plot will then be ready for late cotton (March-early April). After the late cotton is harvested, there will be enough time to prepare the land for the early cotton. The second plot would start with late cotton, then early cotton, maize and again late cotton. Planting cotton after early April not only results in low yields but also disrupts the whole cropping calendar. In practice this cropping pattern lacked flexibility and planting periods for cotton of four months occurred. A comparison of the projected yield and the actual production figures for cotton and maize is given in the tables below:  Comparison of projected cotton yield with actual yields    All projections are derived from the World Bank appraisal report 1977.  Tenants were to harvest 2,500\u00a0kg in their first year, 2,600\u00a0kg in their second, 2,700 in their third, 2,800\u00a0kg in their fourth, 2,900\u00a0kg in their fifth and after 3,000\u00a0kg. Many settlers grew their first cotton crop in this year and started thus with a yield of 2,500. This resulted in the same average projection as in the previous year.  Pest problems.  In this cropping season there was a serious water problem.  Good water, but very serious pest problems.  No cotton was grown due to the collapse of the scheme (see below).

Maize was supposed to be intercropped with cowpeas, and this would increase the value of the 'maize' harvest with 50%. The planting of cowpeas never materialized. It was also planned that the tenants would grow groundnuts, a high value crop, but this turned out not to be possible. This implies that the projected maize figures should be 50% higher to make them fully comparable with the actual yields.  Contrary to the cotton records, the maize production figures are considered to be unreliable. This applies certainly to the 1982 and 1983 statistics, but even the figures for the years after 1983 are considered to be inflated. Vainio-Matilla estimates the yields per ha of most farmers below 600\u00a0kg/ha   Tenants were to harvest 2,000\u00a0kg in their first year, 2,500\u00a0kg in their second, 2,800\u00a0kg in their third, 3,100\u00a0kg in their fourth, 3,400\u00a0kg in their fifth and in their sixth and after 3,700\u00a0kg. Many new settlers arrived in this period and they grew their first maize crop in this year and started thus with a yield of 2,000\u00a0kg. This resulted in the same average projection as the previous year.  In 1989 the cropping pattern at Bura was in disarray and in order to reorganize planting, one maize crop was skipped.  In this maize season there was a serious water problem.  All government funds were frozen.  The project had collapsed (see below) and no maize was grown.  As the tables show the production in the project was very disappointing. If it is taken into account that no cowpeas and groundnuts have been planted, the picture becomes even worse. A mid-term review in 1985 projected a cash income for the tenants between Kshs 5,000 and 6,000 for the year 1984. For the years after 1985 it calculated an income of Kshs 7,400 (55% of the appraisal estimate in real terms) if the cotton yield would be 2,500\u00a0kg. With an average yield of 2,005 for the years 1982-1989, the cash income would have been about Kshs 5,620 or almost 40% of the appraisal estimate. In 1986 75% of the tenants received a cash income and 25% nothing. In 1989 only 35% of the tenants received a cash income and following year only 20% of the tenants received an cash income. After 1992 no production took place and the tenants no longer received any cash income.  Thus, tenant incomes have been disappointing, but it is doubtful whether incomes would have been better with higher yields, as a trade-off exist between the tenant incomes and the annual loss that the project makes. In 1990, the World Bank pointed out that the project made an annual loss of Kshs 17,000 per settler. If the project wanted to be financially viable, then the tenants were expected to pay this annual loss through their service charges. At Bura, the tenants paid Kshs 3,000 per settler, but to reach a break-even point, the tenants should have paid a much higher amount, meaning that tenants would not earn any income. The project management finds itself in a balancing act that on the one hand it has to keep the charges at such a level that the tenants do not lose interest in farming, whereas at the same time it needs to keep the annual loss on its operations as low as possible. In the beginning the project got adequate government support to take care of the losses, although a side effect was that the operation and maintenance of the project suffered. Later the government support was reduced.  Afforestation and the spread of Prosopis  In order to avoid the destruction of the riverine forest and other environmental damage in Bura, a plantation programme was included in the BISP. The World Bank estimated that 3,900 ha forest would be necessary. It calculated that the cost of irrigating would be low, as surplus water would be used. In the early nineties the area was scaled down to 600 ha. In 1983 the NIB forester established a plot of 10 ha with Prosopis. Later this plot was the main source of seeds for other treeplanting activities and for natural regeneration of \u2018wild\u2019 Prosopis.  After establishment of the forest plots, Prosopis spread vigorously outside the plantations. Animals ate the pods and moved around the scheme dispersing the seeds in their droppings. Whenever water was available, seeds in the droppings germinated readily and within a few years almost all canal sides in Bura were occupied by this fast growing shrub. This \u2018wild\u2019 Prosopis, in Tana River County popularly known as Mathenge, did not limit itself to the canal banks and it also blossomed along roads, in the fields and villages.  By 1991, Prosopis had solved the fuelwood problem and tenants even earned income by burning charcoal. The pods were used as animal food and wind erosion in the area was reduced. Unfortunately eradicating the tree at unwanted places as in the fields and along the canal banks was almost impossible because after cutting the stumps coppice vigorously and within a few months, as long as a little water is available, a new shrub has emerged. As early as 1992, experts concluded that whatever the future of BISP, Prosopis will remain there permanently and will change the environment.  Collapse of BISP After 1992 till 2004 production in Bura Irrigation and Settlement Project was negligible. The cumulative effect of a number of factors caused this failure. The main underlying reason was lack of funds to operate the project. Since 1989 the project did not receive enough funds for cultivating a full crop cycle. Together with poor pest control and lack of adequate irrigation water, this resulted in very low yields and crop failures. Two external factors made the situation worse. Firstly the insecurity in Somalia spilled over into Tana County and the Bura Project area was regularly attacked by well-armed roaming bandits. Secondly, due to high inflation and economic liberalization the prices for agricultural inputs skyrocketed. Thus, the cost for chemicals was Ksh 1,850 in 1987 and 12,000 per ha in 1992. The price for fertilizer went up from 260 to 1,000 per bag. At the same time the cotton price in 1992 remained Ksh 16/= kg, as it had been in 1987. For a full crop cycle the management needed Ksh 98 million and it had received only 10.4 million. Moreover, the figure of 98 million did not include expenditure for maintenance of the inlet and settling basin, the conveyance system, domestic water supply, maintenance of houses, roads and the sewerage system. At that time the conveyance system was considered to have silted up and to need a full rehabilitation. A few years later a study estimated that in total 500 000m3 silt would have to be removed.  Since no agricultural production took place, by 1996 at least one third of the tenants had abandoned the project. The remaining population were mainly women and children as most adult men had left the project to find work elsewhere. In addition to remittances, households were surviving on odd jobs for government, National Youth Service and BISP staff, on charcoal burning and small scale trade. A few NGOs assisted and once in a while famine relief was distributed by both the government and NGOs. Research in 1996 showed that 90% of the Bura population was \u2018at risk and vulnerable\u2019. Most of the people remaining in Bura had no place to go and hoped that the project would be revived. This belief/dream was further dented when during the El Nino rains of 1997 a huge protection dyke at Nanighi was washed away. Subsequently the supply canal became part of the natural drainage system and repairs would be a costly affair.  Rehabilitation, Production and Indebtedness In the early stages there was hardly any change after the return of Bura to the NIB. Although the NIB carried out rehabilitation works and installed two new pumps, little production took place until the Economic Stimulus Programme (ESP) was initiated in 2009. The objective of ESP was to jump-start the Kenyan economy towards long-term growth and development after the 2007/2008 post-election violence that affected the Kenyan economy. Earlier in 2007 the government had launched Vision 2030 and one of its flagships was the Bura Irrigation Scheme. Logically Bura became one of the main projects to benefit from the ESP. Under ESP, Bura was to be fully rehabilitated and even expanded. The NIB has claimed that rehabilitation of about 2,500 ha took place successfully, but very little information has been released about the actual area planted with crops, crop production, the number of tenants and their income.  After the rehabilitation the NIB introduced a new management system. Since its inception the management of the scheme had been responsible for the water supply and bought inputs centrally. Also the management organized spraying, ploughing and marketing. After harvesting the management deducted  the cost of these services from the proceeds of its tenants. In 2002 the NIB had restructured itself and remained only with core functions, the most important one being the supply of irrigation water. The other functions were delegated  to the private sector and tenants were to be given loans to pay for these services, including the water supply, by commercial financial institutions. At Bura, Equity Bank became the sole active financial institution. Equity charged 10% interest whereas before the tenants did not pay interest. Although water is the main task of the NIB, the tenants in the scheme regularly criticised the NIB for not delivering enough water for the crops as per its mandate.  This management system could work if a viable cropping pattern would be available, but this was and is lacking at Bura. Tenants planted cotton in 2010 and 2011. In 2010 most tenants made a small profit, but in the next year the crop failed, leaving the tenants without income and with debts with Equity Bank. Since then no cotton has been cultivated as it is considered non-profitable. For food the tenants grew maize, but this crop was commercially not viable and although it has provided the tenants with the necessary subsistence food, it also resulted in more arrears. Moreover, when the tenants wanted to market their surplus maize, there was no market available. Alternative crops (chillies) have also not been successful and left tenants with debts as well. The only crop which has been grown with success is seed maize. Unfortunately, due to the quality of the soils, the margins for this crop are low at Bura and do not make it possible for the tenants to repay already existing debts or to pay for the cost of their food maize.  The NIB has not released production and income figures for the Bura tenants. It has presented the production figures of all its schemes but Bura in the Economic Review. The information on its website is scanty and annual reports have not been produced despite the fact that parastatals are legally obliged to publish these. The NIB has also not published the total debts of the tenants with Equity Bank. The Bura Farmers Welfare Watch Tower, a local pressure group of tenants, has stated that Equity Bank has reported 65% of the tenants to Credit Reference Bureaus. Officially these tenants have no longer access to credit facilities and could thus no longer grow crops.  The indebtedness of the tenants became also a matter of concern for the NIB and it replaced Equity Bank with the Agricultural Finance Corporation (AFC), a wholly government-owned Development Finance Institution (DFI). Since 2014 the AFC has financed the production of food and later also of seed maize. AFC disregarded the CBR advice and all tenants were eligible for loans for its loans. Unfortunately there was no market for the surplus food maize produced by the tenants in the first year and this forced farmers to sell their produce for low prices and made it impossible to repay even part of their debts. Many of these tenants were blacklisted by AFC and had again no longer access to credit. In practice this means that these tenants cannot grow any crop at all. In December 2015 a large part of the seed maize crop failed due to lack of irrigation water. This time, and for the first time, the tenants started a legal procedure against the NIB demanding that it compensates the tenants fully for their losses. According to the chairman of the Bura Farmers Welfare Watch Tower, in 2016 the total debt of the tenants (Equity and AFC) was Kshs 240 million or about Ksh 100,000 per tenant.  Bura in perspective  The future for Bura's tenants looks bleak. In the meantime (2017) about half of the original tenants have died and the remaining ones are old and fragile. Business people have started to hire plots from (absentee) tenants for small amounts to grow especially seed maize. Since these people do not have to plant food, they can make a profit.  Many members of the second generation left Bura and after having seen the collapse, have limited interest in returning. The original and second generation tenants still living in Bura hope that a gravity water supply will improve their fate, but it is unclear  when this will be implemented and be ready. Without viable cropping pattern, however, gravity will have little impact apart from making the production of food crops cheaper. In the opinion of the management, genetically modified cotton varieties might become a viable crop.  So far the only conclusion can be that, apart from a few years in the eighties, the tenants at Bura have had a miserable life despite the gigantic amounts of money that have been invested. Bura is one of the clearest examples of what Moris has described as a privileged solution in his article '\u00cdrrigation: a privileged solution in African Development'. A privileged solution, in the analysis of Moris, is thought not to require testing and analysis. It is assumed that the solution will deliver and no critical analysis is made of the past performance or its cost effectiveness. A person challenging this solution is ridiculed. In Kenya, obviously, irrigation has this status. Irrigation is postulated as the solution for food problems and drought without analysing the extremely poor performance of this sector.

It was initiated in the late 1970s, and the first phase was completed in 1988. The project has two components, the irrigation scheme and the settlement scheme. The irrigation scheme involves the construction of a dam on the Tana River, which will provide water for irrigation to farmers in the Tana River District. The settlement scheme involves the construction of a new town, which will provide housing for the farmers who will be displaced by the irrigation scheme. The project has been criticized for its environmental impact, and for its potential to cause social dislocation. The dam will flood a large area of the Tana River, and will change the way of life for many people who live along the river. The new town will also have a significant impact on the landscape, and will require the displacement of many people. The project is being implemented by the Kenya Sugar Board, and is being funded by the government of Kenya and by the World Bank.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 51875617}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Constitution of Uruguay\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Constitution of Uruguay () is the supreme law of Uruguay. Its first version was written in 1830 and its last amendment was made in 2004.  Uruguay's first constitution was adopted in 1830, following the conclusion of the three-year-long Cisplatine War in which Argentina and Uruguay acted as a federation: the United Provinces of the R\u00edo de la Plata. Mediated by the United Kingdom, the 1828 Treaty of Montevideo allowed to build the foundations for a Uruguayan state and constitution. It has been reformed in 1918, 1934, 1942, 1952 and 1967, but it still maintains several articles from its first version of 1830.  Versions  Original Constitution (1830 - 1918)   When it became independent on August 25, 1825, the Oriental Republic of Uruguay (Rep\u00fablica Oriental del Uruguay) drew up its first constitution, which was promulgated on July 18, 1830. This text has been regarded as Uruguay's most technically perfect charter. Heavily influenced by the thinking of the French and American revolutions, it divided the government among the executive, legislative, and judicial powers and established Uruguay as a unitary republic with a centralized form of government. The bicameral General Assembly (Asamblea General) was empowered to elect a president with considerable powers to head the executive branch for a four-year term. The president was given control over all of his ministers of government and was empowered to make decisions with the agreement of at least one of the three ministers recognized by the 1830 constitution.  Like all of Uruguay's charters since then, the 1830 constitution provided for a General Assembly composed of a Chamber of Senators (C\u00e1mara de Senadores), or Senate (Senado), elected nationally, and a Chamber of Representatives (C\u00e1mara de Representantes), elected from the departments. Members of the General Assembly were empowered to pass laws but lacked the authority to dismiss the president or his ministers or to issue votes of no confidence. An 1834 amendment, however, provided for juicio pol\u00edtico, or impeachment, of the ministers for \"unacceptable conduct\".  As established by the 1830 constitution, the Supreme Court of Justice (Suprema Corte de Justicia), and lesser courts, exercised the judicial power. The General Assembly appointed the members of the high court. The latter \u2013 with the consent of the Senate in the case of the appellate courts \u2013 appointed the members of the lesser courts. The constitution also divided the country into departments, each headed by a governor appointed by the president and each having an advisory body called a Neighbors' Council (Consejo de Vecinos).  Although the 1830 constitution remained in effect for eighty-seven years, de facto governments violated it repeatedly. In the 1878-90 period, the Blancos and Colorados initiated the framework for a more stable system through understandings called \"pacts between the parties.\" This governing principle, called coparticipation (coparticipaci\u00f3n), meaning the sharing of formal political and informal bureaucratic power, has been formally practiced since 1872.  The anniversary of the 1830 promulgation of this original constitution on July 18 is now a public holiday in Uruguay.  Second Constitution (1918 - 1934)   In 1913 President Jos\u00e9 Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez (1903\u201307, 1911\u201315), the father of modern Uruguay, proposed a constitutional reform involving the creation of a Swiss-style collegial executive system to be called the colegiado. A strong opponent of the one-person, powerful presidency, Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez believed that a collective executive power would neutralize the dictatorial intentions of political leaders. It met intense opposition, however, not only from the Blancos but also from members of his own Colorado Party. The proposal was defeated in 1916, but Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez worked out a deal with a faction of the Blancos whereby a compromise system was provided for in the second constitution, which was approved by a plebiscite on 25 November 1917.  The history of successive constitutions is one of a lengthy struggle between advocates of the collegial system and those of the presidential system. Although the 1917 constitution worked well during the prosperous time after World War I, recurring conflicts between the president and the colegiado members made the executive power ineffective in coping with the economic and social crises wracking the country. These conflicts eventually led to the presidential coup of 1933. The ad hoc government suspended the constitution and appointed a constituent assembly to draw up a new one.  Third Constitution (1934 - 1942)   The 1934 constitution abolished the colegiado and transferred its power to the president. Nevertheless, presidential powers remained somewhat limited. The executive power once again was exercised by a president who had to make decisions together with the ministers. The 1934 charter established the Council of Ministers (Consejo de Ministros) as the body in which these decisions were to be made. This council consisted of the president and the cabinet ministers. The constitution required the chief executive to appoint three of the nine cabinet ministers from among the members of the political party that received the second largest number of votes in the presidential election. The General Assembly, for its part, could issue votes of no confidence in cabinet ministers, with the approval of two-thirds of its members.  The constitution divided the Senate between the Blancos and the Colorados or, as political scientist Martin Weinstein has pointed out, between the Herrerist faction of the Blancos (named after Luis Alberto de Herrera) and the Terrist wing of the Colorados (named after Gabriel Terra; president, 1931\u201338). The party that garnered the second largest number of votes automatically received 50 percent of the Senate seats. In addition, the 1934 charter empowered the Supreme Court of Justice to rule on the constitutionality of the laws. This system, which lasted eighteen years, further limited the power of the president and his government.  Fourth Constitution (1942 - 1951)   Uruguay returned to a more democratic system in 1942.  Fifth Constitution (1951 - 1967)   On 13 July 1951, a formal pact between a fraction of the Colorados and the Herrerist Movement of the Blancos called for a plebiscite on constitutional reform. The plebiscite the following December 16 drew less than half of the 1.1 million voters to the polls, but the collegial system was approved by a small margin.  A fourth constitution was promulgated on 25 January 1952 as the culmination of an effort to reestablish the colegiado and the plural executive power, the National Council of Government (Consejo Nacional de Gobierno), with six majority-party seats and three minority-party seats. This nine-member colegiado was ineffective because the president lacked control over the ministers and because the majority was seldom united. In the end, the ineffectiveness of these governments caused the public to turn against the colegiado arrangement.  Sixth Constitution (1967 - 1997)   In the elections of 27 November 1966, nearly 59 percent of Uruguayans voted to amend the 1952 constitution and to reestablish a presidential system of government, thus ending a fifteen-year experiment with the colegiado. The new constitution, which became operative on 15 February 1967, and has remained in effect since then, created a strong one-person presidency, subject to legislative and judicial checks. In free and fair elections, Uruguayans approved the new charter and elected the Colorado Party to power again.  Dictatorial period (1973-1985)  In 1976, however, the military government issued a series of constitutional decrees that amended the 1967 constitution by creating the Council of the Nation (Consejo de la Naci\u00f3n) to serve as the supreme governmental body, with executive and legislative functions. It consisted of the thirty members of the Council of State (Consejo de Estado), the body created by the regime in June 1973 to act in lieu of the General Assembly, which was dissolved by the regime and the twenty-eight senior officers of the armed forces (sixteen from the army, six from the navy, and six from the air force). The Council of the Nation appointed the president of the republic and the members of the Council of State, the Supreme Court of Justice, and the Tribunal of Administrative Claims, which was later dissolved in 1985. Eight institutional acts substituted for many of the functional provisions and guarantees of the 1967 constitution. For example, in addition to giving the Council of the Nation the power to appoint the president of the republic and to set general policy for the country, institutional acts deprived previous officeholders and candidates of their political rights and permitted the arbitrary dismissal of public employees.  Back to institutionality  In 1985, Julio Mar\u00eda Sanguinetti was sworn in as the new democratically elected president, after 12 years of dictatorship. The military question was tough to address; after much political bargaining, at the end of December was passed the Expiry Law, which constituted an amnesty of sorts for military people who had committed human-rights abuses. The constitutionality of this law was challenged, but ultimately the citizens backed the law in a plebiscite held in April 1989.  Current (1997 - present)   The 1967 Constitution is still in effect, though it was amended in 1989, 1994, 1996, and 2004. Though some consider the amendments of 1996 to have created a new constitution, Parliament continues to consider them changes to the Constitution of 1967.  The most important concepts that changed in 1996 were those related to elections. From 1999 onwards, the election cycle starts in June, with primary elections for all the parties, in order to choose single presidential candidates; in October, general elections are held, if no presidential candidate scores an absolute majority, a second round of voting is held in November; and finally, in May of the following year, municipal elections are held in all the Departments.

The constitution is a set of fundamental principles and established legal procedures according to which the country is governed. The Constitution of Uruguay was adopted on 18 March 1917, during the administration of President Baltasar Brum. The constitution was drafted by a constitutional committee created in 1912, which was composed of representatives of all the parties in the National Assembly, and its text was submitted to a popular referendum in 1916, where it was approved by a large majority. The Constitution of Uruguay is one of the most democratic in the world, and is considered one of the most liberal in Latin America. It is based on the principles of freedom, equality, and fraternity, and on the idea that the people have the right to determine their own destiny. The constitution guarantees the right to life, liberty, and security, as well as the right to participate in the government. The constitution also establishes the structure of the government, which is composed of three branches: the executive, the legislative, and the judicial. The executive branch is headed by the President, who is elected by popular vote and is the head of state and government. The legislative branch is composed of two chambers: the Chamber of Representatives, which is elected by popular vote, and the Senate, which is elected by indirect vote. The judicial branch is composed of the Supreme Court, which is the highest court in the country. The Constitution of Uruguay has been amended several times since it was first enacted. The first amendment was made in 1933, when the constitution was modified to allow for the creation of the National Security Council. The second amendment was made in 1942, when the constitution was modified to allow for the creation of the Court of Accounts. The third amendment was made in 1952, when the constitution was modified to allow for the creation of the Office of the General Comptroller. The fourth amendment was made in 1967, when the constitution was modified to allow for the creation of the Superior Council of the Judiciary. The fifth amendment was made in 1992, when the constitution was modified to allow for the creation of the Office of the Special Secretary for the Prevention of Money Laundering.

He was the eldest son of Duke Casimir I the Restorer and Maria Dobroniega of Kiev.  Boles\u0142aw II is considered to have been one of the most capable of the Piast rulers. In 1075 he re-established the Archdiocese of Gniezno (consecrated in 1064) and founded the Diocese of P\u0142ock. He established Benedictine monasteries in Mogilno, Lubin and Wroc\u0142aw. Boles\u0142aw II was also the first Polish monarch to produce his own coinage in quantity great enough to replace the foreign coins prevalent in the country during the reigns of the first Piast kings. He established royal mints in Krak\u00f3w and Wroc\u0142aw and reformed the coinage, which brought considerable revenue into the royal coffers. All these efforts had an enormous influence on the economic and cultural development of the country.  According to the chronicler Gallus Anonymus, during his reign he was called largus (\"the Generous\" in English, \"Szczodry\" in Polish) as he founded many churches and monasteries throughout Poland. The nickname \"the Bold\" (\u015amia\u0142y) was only given to Boles\u0142aw II for the first time in the later Chronicle of the Polish kings, although it was considered by historiography of the 19th and 20th centuries as a contemporary nickname.  Duke of Poland Following the death of his father Casimir in 1058, Boles\u0142aw II, as the eldest son, inherited Greater and Lesser Poland as well as the Mazovian, Pomerelian, and Silesian lands. His younger brothers W\u0142adys\u0142aw Herman and Mieszko became Governors of the remaining provinces. However Mieszko died relatively early, in 1065, at which point his lands came under the authority of Boles\u0142aw II.  His father had left him a stabilised country; Boles\u0142aw II continued his foreign policy on surrounding his realm with allied kingdoms in order to prevail against the extensive Holy Roman Empire in the west; he aimed to have Poland eventually bordering only allied countries. This is said to be the main reason behind his numerous foreign interventions: in 1060\u20131063 he intervened in Hungary to aid his uncle King B\u00e9la I in the inheritance conflict with his nephew Solomon, who was backed by his brother-in-law King Henry IV of Germany. As a result, B\u00e9la, in 1061, with the support of Polish troops, gained power.  In Hungary, Boles\u0142aw II pursued the policy of cooperation with the anti-Imperial faction, which allowed him to gain political independence from the Empire but put him in conflict with the Duchy of Bohemia, an Imperial ally. Moreover, he escalated the conflict with the P\u0159emyslid duke Vratislaus II by refusing to pay the annual homage for Silesia and spurring the Bohemian nobility to revolt. In 1063, Boles\u0142aw II unsuccessfully besieged the then-Moravian town of Hradec nad Moravic\u00ed and was forced to retreat. In the end, relations with Vratislaus II were settled to a certain extent when the latter married Princess \u015awi\u0119tos\u0142awa, Boles\u0142aw II's sister.  Meanwhile, in 1063, King B\u00e9la I of Hungary died. Boles\u0142aw II could not defend the cause of his son G\u00e9za I against the German troops of Henry IV, who finally installed Solomon on the Hungarian throne. In 1069 Grand Prince Iziaslav I of Kiev and his wife Gertruda, Boles\u0142aw's aunt, were overthrown. A Polish military campaign re-established them in power in Kiev.  In 1071 Boles\u0142aw II attacked Bohemia again. As he refused any attempt at arbitration by King Henry IV, the question was settled by an armistice between the two belligerents; however, Boles\u0142aw II, ignoring the treaty, renewed his attack in 1072 and refused to pay the tributes for Silesia to the Holy Roman Empire. Henry IV prepared for a campaign against Poland, but was hit by the outbreak of the Saxon Rebellion in 1073.  Due to his involvement in Hungarian, Bohemian and Kievan affairs, Boles\u0142aw II neglected Poland's interests on the Baltic coast. Therefore, in either 1060 or 1066, Gda\u0144sk Pomerania (Pomerelia) severed its ties to the Polish Kingdom.  King of Poland When Hildebrand of Sovana, an enemy of the German king, became Pope Gregory VII in 1073, Boles\u0142aw II saw in him a natural ally; he started to apply the Pope's reforms in the Archbishopric of Gniezno and commenced negotiations to obtain the royal crown. He spurred the ongoing revolt in Saxony, which had forced Henry IV to retreat from that region (he crushed the revolt at the Battle of Langensalza soon thereafter); the Polish king seized the occasion to launch an invasion against Henry IV's vassal, Vratislaus II of Bohemia, alongside an ally from Grand Prince Vladimir II Monomakh of Kiev.  Thanks to his support of the papal cause during the investiture controversy in the Holy Roman Empire, Boles\u0142aw II gained the royal crown of Poland: on Christmas Day of 1076 Archbishop Bogumi\u0142 crowned him in the Gniezno Cathedral in the presence of a papal legate. King Henry's IV act of contrition at the Walk to Canossa in 1077 included also the imperial recognition of Boles\u0142aw II's royal title. Boles\u0142aw's new authority, along with his pride, however, caused the Polish magnates to rebel, as they feared the monarchy had started to grow too powerful.  Deposition and death In 1077 Boles\u0142aw II's troops helped two pretenders to assume the throne: Ladislaus I of Hungary, another son of B\u00e9la I, and again Iziaslav in Kiev. In 1078, while returning from the latter campaign, the Polish troops conquered Red Ruthenia. In 1079, however, the conflict with the Polish nobles culminated into open revolt and Boles\u0142aw was deposed and banished from the country. The circumstances that led to the King's banishment hinge on the person of Bishop Stanislaus of Krak\u00f3w, who had excommunicated the king for his infidelity.  From historical records it appears that Bishop Stanislaus was involved with the barons' opposition movement, plotting to remove the King and to place his brother W\u0142adys\u0142aw Herman on the throne. Boles\u0142aw II unilaterally declared Stanislaus guilty of treason \u2013 Gallus Anonymus uses the word \"traditor\" meaning traitor. The historical record was first proposed by Master Wincenty Kad\u0142ubek, writing nearly 100 years after Gallus Anonymus and a century and a half after the actual affair.  Boles\u0142aw II on 11 April 1079 assaulted and then personally wielded the sword that murdered Bishop Stanislaus of Krak\u00f3w during the celebration of a Mass. Though the bishop had privately and then publicly warned the king to repent of adultery and other vices, Boles\u0142aw chose a course of action more characteristic of his nickname, \"the Bold\".  He found refuge at the court of King Ladislaus, who also owed his crown to the deposed king. However, according to Gallus Anonymus, Boles\u0142aw II's atrocious conduct towards his Hungarian hosts caused his premature death in 1081 or 1082 at the hands of an assassin, probably by poisoning. He was about 40 years old.  Ossiach legend A popular legend holds that Boles\u0142aw proceeded to Rome to beg forgiveness from Pope Gregory, who imposed on him to wander incognito as a mute repentant. On a summer evening in 1082, he reached the Benedictine Abbey at Ossiach in Carinthia, where he was received and did all kind of hard work until he finally was reconciled in the Sacrament of Penance and died.  At the walls of Ossiach, there exists a tomb bearing the depiction of a horse and the inscription Rex Boleslaus Polonie occisor sancti Stanislai Epi Cracoviensis (\"Boles\u0142aw, King of Poland, murderer of Saint Stanislaus, Bishop of Krak\u00f3w\"). In 1960, at the direction of Countess Karolina Lanckoro\u0144ska, the tomb was opened and indeed revealed male bones and the remains of a Polish knight's armor dating from the 11th century.  The legend, however, dates from centuries after the king's death (it was first mentioned by the chronicler Maciej Miechowita in 1499). His burial place actually remains unknown. Another popular hypothesis about the fate of his remains claims that in 1086 they were transferred to the Benedictine abbey of Tyniec near Krak\u00f3w.  Marriage and issue Before 1069 Boles\u0142aw II married Wyszes\u0142awa (d. aft. 1089), who, according to the Chronicle of Jan D\u0142ugosz (and supported by some sources), was a daughter of Grand Prince Sviatoslav II of Kiev by his first wife Kilikia, possibly a member of the House of Dithmarschen. They had one son, Mieszko (1069 \u2013 1089).  Modern historians, led by Oswald Balzer (in 1895), refuted the Kievan origin and name of Boles\u0142aw II's wife and expounded the theory that his wife was the queen named Agnes whose obituary is recorded in Zwiefalten. She may have belonged to the P\u0159emyslid dynasty.

Boles\u0142aw was the eldest son of Duke Casimir I of Poland by his wife Christina Ingerbrit, daughter of King Inge I of Sweden. He was born in 1085, though according to some historians, he was born around 1043. After the death of his father in 1095, Boles\u0142aw II succeeded in the Duchy of Poland, which he ruled jointly with his younger brothers, Mieszko and Boles\u0142aw the Tall. Their mother, Christina, ruled as Dowager Duchess until her death in 1112. Like his father, Boles\u0142aw was involved in the power struggles of the region. He was defeated by his uncle, Duke W\u0142adys\u0142aw I Herman of Masuria, who killed Boles\u0142aw's brother Mieszko in the Battle of Giecz in 1105. Soon afterwards, Boles\u0142aw was able to reconquer his brother's inheritance. In 1118, Boles\u0142aw took part in the Battle of Nisko against Duke Boles\u0142aw I the Tall. He was defeated and captured by the latter, who forced him to renounce his claims to the Polish throne. Soon afterwards, Boles\u0142aw was released from prison. He then joined the 1120 Battle of Kietlicz against Duke Henry V of Germany, who was allies with Boles\u0142aw I the Tall. He was again defeated and captured by the Duke of Germany, who this time did not release him. After the death of Boles\u0142aw I the Tall in 1138, Boles\u0142aw II again tried to reclaim his inheritance. He probably took part in the Battle of the Dnieper against the Cumans in 1141, when his uncle, Duke Casimir I of Opole, was killed. In 1146, Boles\u0142aw joined the Grand Prince of Kiev, Iziaslav II, in his war against the Cumans. In 1150, Boles\u0142aw gave his territories to his younger brother, Henry, and then went to the court of the Grand Prince of Kiev, where he spent the last years of his life. He was buried in the Pochayiv Monastery, in present-day Ukraine. Boles\u0142aw II was married to Salomea, a daughter of Duke Casimir I of Opole. They had four children: 1. Casimir (d. 1171), Duke of Opole and Racib\u00f3rz, married to Agnes of Babenberg, daughter of Duke Henry II of Austria. 2.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Tightrope walking\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Tightrope walking, also called funambulism, is the skill of walking along a thin wire or rope. It has a long tradition in various countries and is commonly associated with the circus. Other skills similar to tightrope walking include slack rope walking and slacklining.  Types  Tightwire is the skill of maintaining balance while walking along a tensioned wire between two points. It can be done either using a balancing tool (umbrella, fan, balance pole, etc.) or \"freehand\", using only one's body to maintain balance. Typically, tightwire performances either include dance or object manipulation. Object manipulation acts include a variety of props in their acts, such as clubs, rings, hats, or canes. Tightwire performers have even used wheelbarrows with passengers, ladders, and animals in their act. The technique to maintain balance is to keep the performer's centre of mass above their support point\u2014usually their feet.  Highwire is a form of tightwire walking but performed at much greater height. Although there is no official height when tightwire becomes highwire, generally a wire over  high are regarded as a highwire act.  Skywalk is a form of highwire which is performed at great heights and length. A skywalk is performed outdoors between tall buildings, gorges, across waterfalls or other natural and man-made structures.  Ropes If the \"lay\" of the rope (the orientation of the constituent strands, the \"twist\" of a rope) is in one direction, the rope can twist on itself as it stretches and relaxes. Underfoot, this could be hazardous to disastrous in a tightrope. One solution is for the rope core to be made of steel cable, laid in the opposite direction to the outer layers, so that twisting forces balance each other out.  Biomechanics Acrobats maintain their balance by positioning their centre of mass directly over their base of support, i.e. shifting most of their weight over their legs, arms, or whatever part of their body they are using to hold them up. When they are on the ground with their feet side by side, the base of support is wide in the lateral direction but narrow in the sagittal (back-to-front) direction. In the case of highwire-walkers, their feet are parallel with each other, one foot positioned in front of the other while on the wire. Therefore, a tightwire walker's sway is side to side, their lateral support having been drastically reduced.  In both cases, whether side by side or parallel, the ankle is the pivot point.  A wire-walker may use a pole for balance or may stretch out his arms perpendicular to his trunk in the manner of a pole. This technique provides several advantages. It distributes mass away from the pivot point, thereby increasing the moment of inertia. This reduces angular acceleration, so a greater torque is required to rotate the performer over the wire. The result is less tipping. In addition, the performer can also correct sway by rotating the pole. This will create an equal and opposite torque on the body.  Tightwire-walkers typically perform in very thin and flexible, leather-soled slippers with a full-length suede or leather sole to protect the feet from abrasions and bruises, while still allowing the foot to curve around the wire. Though very infrequent in performance, amateur, hobbyist, or inexperienced funambulists will often walk barefoot so that the wire can be grasped between the big and second toe. This is more often done when using a rope, as the softer and silkier fibres are less taxing on the bare foot than the harder and more abrasive braided wire.

Metaphorical use The word funambulism or the phrase walking a tightrope is also used in a metaphorical setting not referring to any actual acrobatic acts. For instance, politicians are said to \"walk a tightrope\" when trying to balance two opposing views with little room for compromise. The term can also be used in satirical or acidic contexts. Nicholas Taleb uses the phrase in his book The Black Swan. \"You get respect for doing funambulism or spectator sports\". Taleb is criticising scientists who prefer popularism to vigorous research and those who walk a fixed and narrow path rather than explore a large field of empirical study.  See also  References    Circus skills", "machine_text": " Tightrope walking, also called funambulism, is the skill of walking along a thin wire or rope. The tightrope is usually stretched between two points and is not fixed at the ends. A funambulist is someone who practices tightrope walking. The first recorded tightrope walk was in the 18th century, but the practice probably goes back to the ancient Chinese. In the 19th century, it was a common circus act. Tightrope walking is still a popular art, with tightrope artists performing in circuses, on the street, and on television. Tightrope walking is not the same as slacklining, which is done on a wider, more flexible rope that is usually set up between two trees. Slacklining is more like tightrope walking than it is like tightrope walking. Tightrope walking can be dangerous. If the rope is too thin, the funambulist may break it. If the rope is too high off the ground, the funambulist may fall and be injured. The funambulist must also be careful not to hit the rope with their head or any other part of their body. Tightrope walking is not a sport, but it is a skill that can be learned. There are many different ways to learn tightrope walking, but the most common method is to start by walking on a low rope and gradually increase the difficulty. Tightrope walking is also used as a training method for other skills, such as balance and coordination. It is also used as a form of exercise. Tightrope walking can be done with or without a safety net. A safety net can help the funambulist feel more confident, but it is not always necessary.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 511445}

It acts as a potent inhibitor of the enzyme ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related (ATR) and with lower potency as an inhibitor of ATM serine/threonine kinase (ATM). These enzymes are both involved in detecting DNA damage as part of cell cycle checkpoints during cell division. By inhibiting their activity, berzosertib interferes with the ability of rapidly dividing cells to detect damage to DNA, and this makes it useful as a potential treatment for some forms of cancer by causing accumulation of DNA damage in the cancer cells and thus reducing their viability. It has progressed furthest in trials for the treatment of ovarian cancer, though also shows activity against numerous other cancer types.  Phase 1 trial results show promising results in the first clinical trial of the drug class.The new study, designed to test the drug's safety, found that half of patients given the new drug either alone or with platinum chemotherapy saw their cancer stop growing, and two patients saw their tumors shrink or disappear completely.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"The Starfish and the Spider\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Starfish and the Spider: The Unstoppable Power of Leaderless Organizations is a 2006 book by Ori Brafman (author of the 2010 book Click: The Magic of Instant Connections) and Rod Beckstrom. It is an exploration of the implications of the rise of decentralized organizations such as Grokster and Wikipedia. The book contrasts them to centralized organizations, such as Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, using compendia of knowledge as examples. The spider and starfish analogy refers to the contrasting biological nature of the respective organisms, starfish having a decentralized neural structure permitting regeneration.  In addition to giving historical examples of decentralized organizations such as Alcoholics Anonymous and the Apaches and analyzing their nature in contrast to centralized organizations, the book considers conflict between centralized and decentralized organizations, including the \"If you can't beat them, join them\" solution of creating hybrid organizations such as Citizendium. A chapter towards the end of the book explores the concept of the \"sweet spot\", the optimal mix of decentralized and centralized attributes.  Summary  Don Verelli was an attorney who championed the effort for MGM to crack down on the peer-to-peer music website Grokster. But although the record labels won the lawsuits, other groups such as Kazaa, and eMule surfaced. The authors compare the record companies to \"spiders\" \u2013 organizations under the control of a central brain or leader \u2013 while the smaller organizations are more like \"starfish\" \u2013 if a limb is severed, the remaining parts are able to regenerate the entire body, resulting in two or more starfish. The spider organization is compared to the Aztec Empire which fell when Montezuma was defeated by Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s and his Spanish army, but the starfish organization is compared to the Apaches, who decentralized and became nomadic, and which the Spanish army could not defeat.  Dave Garrison of Netcom attempts to explain the Internet to executives in Paris, but is met with questions such as who would run the Internet. The authors look into the starfish Alcoholics Anonymous, which survives and thrives even away from the founder. They also look into the history of the music industry since the 19th century from live performers to recording on small labels to ownership from the big five record companies to Napster and other peer-to-peer networks. They list questions that determine whether an organization is more like a spider or a starfish. The authors discuss some founders of starfish organizations: Niklas Zennstrom and Skype; Craig Newmark and Craigslist. They discuss the formation of the Apache software model and how editors work on Wikipedia articles. They then discuss the starfish self-organization of participants in the Burning Man festival.  English lawyer Granville Sharp's decision to defend the freedom of a slave named Jonathan Strong leads him to connect with the Quakers and to advocate for the abolition of the slave trade. The authors use Sharp's story to illustrate five foundational principles called the Five Legs: 1) Circles; 2) The Catalyst; 3) Ideology; 4) The Preexisting Network; 5) The Champion. They apply the Five Legs to the story of Elizabeth Cady Stanton who served as a catalyst to the women's rights movement in the USA with Susan B. Anthony as the champion. They then focus on some examples of catalysts: Jimmy Wales of Wikipedia; Deborah Alvarez-Rodriguez, who worked for the city of San Francisco and later Goodwill; entrepreneur Auren Hoffman and Josh Sage. They list a set of catalyst's tools including: Genuine Interest in Others, Loose Connections, Mapping, Desire to Help, Meet People Where They Are, Emotional Intelligence, Trust, Inspiration, Tolerance for Ambiguity, Hands-Off Approach and Receding. They contrast the work of a catalyst with that of a CEO.  Using the Animal Liberation Front as an example of a decentralized group similar to Al-Qaeda, the authors suggest three strategies of dealing with decentralized groups: Changing Ideology (or introducing better competing ideologies), Centralizing Them (Cow Principle, what defeated the Apaches), and Decentralizing Yourself (If you can't beat 'em, join 'em) The authors suggest organization uses a hybrid model that blends both centralized and decentralized concepts, such as with eBay. They also cite other instances of hybrids such as Amazon.com letting volunteer reviewers contribute and Intuit having a TaxAlmanac website for people to help each other. The authors discuss Peter Drucker's assessment of General Motors's management process, how it led to Toyota taking over the auto industry, and how they later collaborated on the NUMMI plant. Similarly the iTunes model of pricing single songs has been a \"sweet spot\" for Apple and their online music store, and other companies are moving to an open-source model with their software.  The authors use a series of analogies throughout their book, summarizing their thoughts with Ten Rules: Diseconomies of scale, The network effect, The power of chaos, Knowledge at the edge, Everyone wants to contribute, Beware the hydra response, Catalysts rule, The values are the organization, Measure Monitor and Manage, and Flatten or be flattened.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"SS Ste. Claire\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "SS Ste. Claire is a steamer located in Detroit, Michigan.  Built in 1910, she was one of the last propeller-driven excursion steamers to be operated on the Great Lakes.  She was declared a US National Historic Landmark in 1992. In 2018, a devastating fire destroyed the upper decks, leaving only the steel structure.  History The Detroit, Belle Isle, & Windsor Ferry Company was incorporated in 1881 to provide ferry service between Detroit, Windsor, Ontario, and Detroit's Belle Isle Park. In 1898, the company began leasing Bois Blanc Island (later known as \"Bob-Lo\") and began offering ferry service to the island. Bois Blanc became a popular day trip destination, with picnic grounds, a small amusement area, dancing and other services. In 1901, the company purchased a large part of the island. Service to Bob-Lo became so popular that in 1902, the company hired Frank E. Kirby to design a passenger excursion steamer, . However, passenger volume continued to increase, and soon the Detroit, Belle Isle, & Windsor Ferry Company commissioned another, slightly smaller steamer. This ship was again designed by Frank E. Kirby, and constructed at the Toledo Shipbuilding Company.  The Ste. Claire was launched at Toledo Shipbuilding Company in 1910, and entered service later that year between Detroit and Bob-Lo Island.  In 1911, the Detroit, Belle Isle, & Windsor Ferry Company was reorganized as the  Detroit and Windsor Ferry Company. However, the construction in the 1920s of the Ambassador Bridge and the Detroit\u2013Windsor Tunnel between Detroit and Windsor, and the MacArthur Bridge to Belle Isle drastically reduced the company's service, and by the late 1930s their only activity was the Detroit-Bob-Lo Island line. In the early 1940s, the company was renamed simply the \"Bob-Lo Excursion Company.\"  The excursion service and Boblo Island Amusement Park were sold in the 1940s, and again in 1979. However, the  Ste. Claire continued operating between Detroit and Bob-Lo Island until 1991, a run of 81 years.  After the island park closed, she was sold to a commercial firm and fell into disrepair.  In 2003 she was towed to Toledo, Ohio for restoration. In 2015, the vessel was towed to the former Detroit Lime Dock on the Rouge River, while her restoration remained in limbo.  Temporary alterations to both Columbia and Ste. Claire were made for the 2014 feature film Transformers: Age of Extinction.  The Saint Claire was engulfed in an accidental fire while docked on the Detroit River on July 6, 2018. The fire could not be contained and destroyed the historic mahogany woodwork and upper decks. \"Yeah, she's 110 years old, but she's well-built and she survived,\" said boat co-owner, Ron Kattoo. \"We are at the point in restoration to where it was a steel skeleton structure ready to be rebuilt.\" As of 2019, the vessel is docked at Riverside Marina in Detroit.  Description The Ste. Claire was a propeller-driven excursion steamer with a riveted steel hull and a wooden superstructure strengthened with steel members. The hull was 190 feet long, 50 feet wide, and 17.3 feet in molded depth. She was powered by a triple expansion reciprocating steam engine with Scotch boilers. The main deck overhung the hull, and the open decks above were rounded at the bow, a characteristic of the Bob-Lo fleet.  The main staircase was in the center of the main deck, leading upward to the upper decks. A second stair underneath lead down to the crew spaces in the hull. On either side of the main stair were gangplank openings for loading passengers. Forward of the stair was a large open deck space. Aft of the stair, a passageway ran across the vessel, aft of which is the stack casing and a well that opened down into the engine room, where the main engine could be seen by passengers on the main deck. Food service counters were placed at the aft end of the main deck, surrounded by open spaces, and a pair of stairs leading to decks above. Amidships, public rest rooms and crews quarters were placed on either side of the ship.  The main staircase lead upward to the main cabin on the second deck. The cabin was finished in mahogany with a cream-painted beamed ceiling. Aft of the cabin was a dance floor. The main cabin had doors out to open spaces forward and aft. The main stair leads upward to another, smaller cabin on the third deck. Doors here lead to the open deck and to a \"beer garden\" located above the dance floor. A final stair on the open deck lead to the top deck. Public access to the top deck was limited; the area also included the pilot house and lifeboat storage.

Ste. Claire SS. Ste. Claire was a Canadian cargo ship that sank on Lake Superior in November, 1958. The ship had left Port Arthur, Ontario, on November 5, with a cargo of 15,260 tons of iron ore, bound for Toledo, Ohio. The ship was last heard from on November 9, and was reported missing two days later. The ship had been built in 1922 by the Canadian Pacific Railway's shipbuilding division as one of a pair of sister ships, the other being SS. Ste. Marie. In the early morning hours of November 22, 1958, the Ste. Claire was driven onto a reef by a storm. The ship broke up and sank in about 90 metres (300 ft) of water. The ship's crew of 29 managed to abandon ship in lifeboats, and were picked up by the Canadian Coast Guard ship CSS Griffon the next day. The ship had sunk in Canadian waters about 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) north of the U.S. territorial border. The Canadian Hydrographic Service has since corrected the charts of the area to show the actual location of the reef, and the lake has been dredged in the area to remove the remains of the ship. The official cause of the disaster was never determined, but the ship's captain, J.E. McWilliam, had ordered a course change that took the ship directly over the reef. In the years since the sinking, several attempts have been made to find the ship, and in 2002, the wreck of the Ste. Claire was discovered.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 16791319}

He has participated in three Summer Olympics, and has won a complete set of medals (gold: 2004 K-1 1000 m and 2012 K-1 1000 m, silver: 2008  K-1 1000 m, bronze: 2004 K-2 1000 m).  Eirik Ver\u00e5s Larsen's definitive international breakthrough came when he and his companion Nils Olav Fjeldheim won the European Championship K2-1000 gold medal in 2000.  Early career Ver\u00e5s Larsen started kayaking at the age of 10 in Flekkefjord, a small town at the south west coast with 8000 inhabitants. Flekkefjord Kayak Club had a history of producing world champions \u2013 such as his coach Olaf S\u00f8yland who won gold medals in K4-10 000m in 1975 and in the K2-1000m in 1979.  As a young competitive athlete on national level Ver\u00e5s Larsen was never the top ranking guy. He was however known as being dedicated, hard working, and he was feared by many for his endurance capacity. Towards the end of his teenage years his hard work started to pay off, and as a 17-year-old he surprised many by winning the bronze medal in the 1993 Nordic Marathon Junior Championship in Sweden.  Ver\u00e5s Larsen moved to Oslo in 1995 in order to be surrounded by the best racers in Norway. For several years he trained in the group around Knut Holman, the number one dominating athlete in the men's K1-1000 meter throughout the 1990s (three olympic gold medals, five times world champion).  International breakthrough Eirik Ver\u00e5s Larsen's definitive international breakthrough came when he and his companion Nils Olav Fjeldheim won the European Championship K2-1000 gold medal in 2000 in Pozna\u0144, Poland. The achievement resulted in a wild-card from the International Canoe Federation for participation in the Sydney Olympics the same year, where they placed 9th on K2-1000.  The golden years \u2013 European-, World Champion In 2001 Ver\u00e5s Larsen won his first World Champion gold medal. He and Nils Olav Fjeldheim were superior to the other teams in the K2-1000 final in Pozna\u0144, Poland. This was the start of Ver\u00e5s Larsen's golden years.  From 2002 Ver\u00e5s Larsen went for combining K1-1000 and K2-1000. Although the K2 continued to perform very well, it was his K1 achievements that would dominate the coming years of his career. He won World Champion Gold medals in K1-1000 in 2002 and 2005.  In 2006 Larsen was never in top shape and did not win any international titles. His best results were 5th on K1-500 in the European Championships, and 6th on K1-1000 in the World Championships.  This wake-up call may well have turned out to sharpen his focus towards the 2008 Olympics for which he was a clear gold candidate. After a disappointing 2006 he was back on track in 2007 and won the Gold medal on K1-1000 at the European Championships, and he finished 3rd in the World Championships later the same year. Before the 2009 season Ver\u00e5s Larsen decided to go for K2 with Jacob Norenberg, and did not race internationally in K1. Together they won the 2009 European Championships at K2-1000 in Germany and finished 5th in the World Championships in Halifax later the same year. Ver\u00e5s Larsen held the individual (K-1) 1000m world record of 3:24.920 (Duisburg 2004) until it was bettered by Ben Fouhy of New Zealand (Pozna\u0144 2006) with the time of 3:24.495 (backwind of 2\u00a0m/s).  Olympic Champion The number one milestone of his career came in the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. Over a few years he had tried to combine K2-1000m, K1-1000m and K1-500m. This was a major challenge as the event racing times were very close in the championship time schedules. In Athens he won gold medal in K1-1000, followed by an impressive bronze medal in K2-1000 one hour later. He also finished 4th at K1-500.  There was some uncertainty around his fitness level in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Since 2005 his best result in the World Championships was 3rd in 2007. He came to Beijing with a 6th place in K2-1000 (with Mattis N\u00e6ss) as his best result from the European Championships, not having participated in K1-1000. In Beijing he won a silver medal at K1-1000 meter only beaten by Tim Brabants (GBR), and claimed that he was very happy as he had done his best race since 2004. He completed a great season by finishing 4th in the Olympic K1-500. He earned his second gold of Olympics in 2012 London Olympics in Canoe Sprint's Kayak Single (K1) 1000m event.  Marathon canoeing In 2001 and 2002 Ver\u00e5s Larsen won the K2 marathon World Championships together with his companion Nils Olav Fjeldheim.  Step down and comeback After the 2009 season Ver\u00e5s Larsen decided that he would not race in 2010. He had attained his goals with several gold medals in both the Olympics and in World Championships, and needed time to decide whether he would go for another Olympics.  On 18 August 2010 a Norwegian newspaper broke the news that Ver\u00e5s Larsen was ready for a comeback, aiming for another gold medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.  In his first international World Cup competition in the comeback season 2011 he finished 2nd on K1-1000m (Pozna\u0144, Poland).  Personal life In 2011 he married Mira Ver\u00e5s Larsen, who also competed as a kayaker in the 2012 Olympics.  Education Eirik Ver\u00e5s Larsen holds a M.Sc. in biomechanics from the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences.

It is the first underground railway system in India, and the first rapid transit system in South Asia. The Metro was opened in 1984, after construction began in 1972. The Metro is a major mode of transport in Kolkata, with an average daily ridership of around 1.4 million passengers in 2019. The Kolkata Metro is the sixth busiest rapid transit system in the world by passenger density, and the third busiest in India, after the Mumbai Metro and the Delhi Metro. The stations of the Kolkata Metro are farther apart than those of most other metros, and the trains are relatively slow. However, the system has the highest daily ridership per route-kilometre in the world, at 1.3 million. The metro has two branches, one from Dum Dum to Kestopur and the other from Dakshineswar to Kestopur. The two branches meet at Esplanade station, and together the two lines form a 21.5 km (13.4 mi) long metro line. The Metro has 27 stations and a total of 36.45 km (19.48 mi) of track. The Kolkata Metro is built to a larger gauge than most other rapid transit systems in the world, and is therefore sometimes described as a \"wide gauge\" metro. The larger gauge is intended to allow for larger trains and higher speeds. The Kolkata Metro has two types of services: 1. The Mainline has a frequency of 2\u20133 minutes during peak hours and 3\u20134 minutes off-peak. 2. The Circular Line has a frequency of 5 minutes during peak hours and 10 minutes off-peak. The Metro Rail is a joint venture of the Government of West Bengal (GoWB) and the Government of India (GoI), through the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA). The West Bengal Metro Rail Corporation Limited (WBMRCL), a company fully owned by the GoWB, is responsible for the implementation of the project. The Kolkata Metro is the first metro in India to use rolling stock manufactured in India. The Kolkata Metro has two types of stations: 1. Underground stations: The stations at Dakshineswar, Chandni Chowk, and Esplanade are underground. 2. Elevated stations: The stations at Dum Dum, Kestopur, and Phoolbagan are elevated. The Kolkata Metro is one of the most energy-efficient rapid transit systems in the world, consuming only 0.48 kWh per traveller per kilometre, compared to a global average of 3.6 kWh per traveller per kilometre. The Kolkata Metro has been in operation since October 1984. The Metro was first proposed in 1965, with the project being approved in 1970. Construction began in 1972, with the first stretch of the Metro being opened in 1984. The Metro was built in two phases, with the first phase being from Dum Dum to Kestopur, and the second phase being from Dakshineswar to Kestopur. The two phases were opened in 1984 and 1995, respectively. The Kolkata Metro has been expanded twice since it was first built. The first expansion was from Dum Dum to Dakshineswar, which was opened in 2009. The second expansion was from Kestopur to Nayapalli, which was opened in 2014. The Nayapalli extension is a branch of the Dum Dum\u2013Dakshineswar line, and is not connected to the rest of the Metro. The Kolkata Metro has been proposed to be expanded further, with a new line from Howrah to Sealdah via Esplanade and a new line from Salt Lake to Howrah via Dum Dum.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 61537314}

The WWF rates the ecoregion as \"Globally Outstanding\" in biological distinctiveness.  Geography and neighbouring ecoregions  The ecoregion is characterised by semi-evergreen rain forest, covering the lower elevations of the Chin Hills and Arakan Mountains in Myanmar's Arakan State, India's Manipur state, the adjacent Chittagong Hills of Bangladesh, and then extending northwards along the Naga Hills and Mizo Hills to cover most of India's Nagaland and Mizoram states, and also eastwards across Myanmar's Sagaing Division and Kachin State to the China-Myanmar border.  The Myanmar coastal rain forests occupy the coastal lowlands of Myanmar south and southwest of this ecoregion. To the west, the ecoregion borders the Meghalaya subtropical forests ecoregion in the Khasi and Garo Hills, and the Brahmaputra Valley semi-evergreen forests in the Brahmaputra lowlands. The Mizoram-Manipur-Kachin rain forests extends up to the  elevation of the Chin Hills-Arakan Yoma range, and the Chin Hills-Arakan Yoma montane forests occupy the portion of the range above . As the Mizoram-Manipur-Kachin forests extend east across Myanmar, they are bounded by the Irrawaddy moist deciduous forests of the Irrawaddy River basin in the south, the higher-elevation Northern Triangle subtropical forests in the north, and the Northern Indochina subtropical forests in the east. The Northeast India-Burma pine forests occupy the higher elevations of the Naga Hills along the Nagaland-Burma border, and are surrounded by the Mizoram-Manipur-Kachin rain forests west, south and east.  Climate The climate of the ecoregion is tropical and humid, although somewhat cooler than the adjacent lowlands. Rainfall comes mostly from the monsoon winds from the Bay of Bengal, and parts of the ecoregion can receive up to  of rain per year.  Flora  In the Mizoram-Manipur-Kachin rainforest, the predominant plant community is semi-evergreen rain forest, which covers the vast majority of the ecoregion's intact area, a total of 36% of the ecoregion. Other plant communities include tropical wet evergreen forest (5% of the ecoregion's total area), tropical moist deciduous forest (2%), montane wet temperate forest (2%), and subtropical montane forest (1%). 19% of the ecoregion's area has been cleared, primarily for agriculture and grazing, and 34% of the ecoregion consists of degraded areas.  The semi-evergreen rain forest is dominated by trees of the dipterocarp family, including Dipterocarpus alatus, D. turbinatus, D. griffithii, Parashorea stellata, Hopea odorata, Shorea burmanica, and Anisoptera scaphula. Trees of other families include Swintonia floribunda, Eugenia grandis, Xylia xylocarpa, Gmelina arborea, Bombax insignis, Bombax ceiba, Albizia procera, and Castanopsis spp.  Fauna  The ecoregion is home to 149 known species of mammals.

The overall mission of MRN is to ensure recognition of migration as a key component of economic progress and development, in the creation of culturally rich and diverse societies, and in the promotion of human, political, social and economic rights and gender equality.  Background The need for a permanent network of migrant organisations in the UK was first identified through the discussions and research undertaken by the Barrow Cadbury Trust funded project entitled 'Migrant Community Organisations in the UK (MCOP)'.  The project explored the possibility for closer and better collaboration between different groups working in the field of migration to strengthen the voice of migrants in the UK. Especially since such organisations often have limited funding, and have been set up to support what are often beleaguered communities with high numbers of refugees and asylum-seekers and/or significant numbers of irregular migrants.  The outcome of the MCOP's work was set out in the report \"Migrant Voices, Migrant Rights\" published by the Barrow Cadbury Trust.  In response to the recommendations of the report, the Migrant Rights Network (MRN) has been established as a permanent network of organisations working to support the development of migrants' rights across the UK. The network's main goal is to develop strategies which will increase the involvement of 'migrant voices' in national policy debates, and enhance cooperation across a wide range of civil society organisations to achieve this end.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Washington Yacht Club\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Washington Yacht Club is a motorboating club on the Anacostia River in Washington, D.C.   Established in 1910 as an all-white organization, the club was integrated in the 1970s, prompting a turnover to predominantly African American membership. In addition to serving as a marina and social club, the Washington Yacht Club has advocated for the environmental protection of the Anacostia, which at one point was one of the most polluted rivers in the United States.  The group's clubhouse and surrounding property were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2020.  History  The Washington Yacht Club was founded on April 27, 1910, by a group of motorboat enthusiasts. Its initial members were white residents of the area east of the Anacostia River in Washington, D.C. They were \"proudly working class\" boaters who often built their boats by hand. Samuel Masson was the club's founding commodore.  The organization was unusual among boating clubs in D.C. at the time for its sole focus on motorboats.  WYC was located at the bottom of Naylor Road SE from its founding until 1915, then relocated to near the Pennsylvania Avenue bridge pier, where they built a clubhouse. They were forced to move again in 1924, this time across from the east bank of the river to the west bank, settling at the club's current site at 1500 M St. SE. In early 1925, members towed the clubhouse across the river, where it stands to this day.  Besides the clubhouse, constructed in 1915, elements of the current site that are historically significant include a 1955 workshop, a 1920s electrical shed, and a portion of the Anacostia seawall.  Members of the yacht club served as on-call marine security during World War II. WYC members also contributed to environmental stewardship of the Anacostia River, reporting polluters and assisting with river cleanup from as early as 1923.  Nevertheless, the Anacostia became extremely polluted throughout the 1900s. Meanwhile, the city's racial layout shifted, with black residents increasingly shunted east of the river. John \u201cSonny\u201d McLean became the first non-white member of the Washington Yacht Club in the 1970s. His membership was limited, however, as he was not allowed in the clubhouse except during important meetings and events. Subsequently, many white members left WYC in reaction to both the club's increasing African American membership and the high levels of river pollution. It has since been described as \"one of the oldest African-American yacht clubs in the country,\" though it is open to members from all backgrounds.  Women also began to join as individual members in the 1970s. Peggy Appellis, the first female individual member, also became the club's first female commodore in 1977.  In 2011, a fire destroyed four boats at the club.  Present day  The club sits along \"Boathouse Row\" in southeast Washington, within Anacostia Park. It is a member of the Historic Anacostia Boating Association.  Steve Ricks is the club's longtime commodore.  WYC applied for historic preservation status for its clubhouse and grounds, arguing, \"The Washington Yacht Club clubhouse epitomizes not only the resilient spirit of Anacostia boating, but to some degree, that of people of Washington as well.\"  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 2, 2020.

History  There already were two navigation light towers built in 1829 and operating in Durham county at Seaton Carew and another at Hartlepool to guide ships clear of Coatham Rocks off Redcar and then onto the Fairway Buoy outside the bar of the River Tees. The building of South Gare lighthouse was planned and supervised by John Fowler, engineer to the Tees Conservancy Commissioners. Both light systems were used until 1892 when use of the light towers at Seaton Carew was discontinued by the Tees Conservancy Commissioners.  The South Gare lighthouse light was originally lit by a paraffin wick lamp. and perhaps subsequently by a pressurised paraffin burner. This was removed in 1955, and in about 1980 the chimney and weather vane were removed. The paraffin lamp was replaced by a mains powered 500\u00a0Watt tungsten filament Incandescent light bulb with a backup bulb on the bulb changer that operated with a backup diesel generator. The light operated with a 1.5\u00a0s flash every 12\u00a0seconds. The lens rotation mechanism was originally powered by a clockwork motor but this was replaced by two electric motors, i.e.\u00a0one duty motor and a backup motor. A fog signal was mounted to the west of the lighthouse but this has evidently been removed. The light source was a 35\u00a0Watt CDM-T lamp until 2007 when it was replaced by a 45\u00a0Watt high intensity LED lamp.  Description  The lighthouse is  high with a cylindrical cast iron clad stone tower all painted white. Small porthole windows in the north and south side of the column light an internal helical newel staircase.  The light source is held in the original eight windowed lantern housing under a hemispherical copper domed roof. Below the windows there is a railed circular platform supported by brackets. The current light source is a 45\u00a0Watt high intensity LED with a fourth order prismatic lens and can be seen for a range of . Set  above mean high water the light operates automatically exhibiting sectored red and white with a 0.5\u00a0s flash every 12\u00a0seconds with an effective intensity of 150,000 Candelas. The light is powered by a Schlunk 100\u00a0Watt water-cooled hydrogen fuel cell a world first. This arrangement is more reliable than the mains electricity supply along the exposed breakwater because of its vulnerability in storms.  The lighthouse is a listed building and still operates using the original lenses. Today the lighthouse is owned and operated by PD Ports, and has the Admiralty code A2626, NGA code 2020, and Amateur Radio Lighthouse Society (ARLHS) code ENG-131.

The lighthouse, completed in 1895, is Grade II listed and is still in use, having been automated in 1976. The lighthouse is built on the South Gare breakwater, a 1.6 km (1 mi) long stone breakwater on the south bank of the River Tees, and was the last lighthouse to be built by the Tees Navigation Company, which was taken over by the Tees and Hartlepool Port Authority in 1892. The breakwater was built to provide shelter for the port of Middlesbrough and to allow ships to navigate the tricky channel of the river. The lighthouse is built in the Victorian style, and is constructed of local stone. The original light was a paraffin lamp, which was replaced in 1932 by an incandescent light.

Nero Wolfe and his assistant, Archie Goodwin, investigate a murder at a school for the performing arts. The victim, a teacher, was apparently shot by a student. But the student has a solid alibi, and Wolfe and Goodwin must look elsewhere for the murderer. The title comes from a line in the Sir Walter Scott poem, \"Marmion\": But the blood is on the hands of the man, And the murder is not yet done: For the shade of the victim is on the wall, And his blood is on the floor. And the guilty man, with his hand on his side, Is thinking of the old woman he killed, And the blood of the innocent is on his hand, And the murder is not yet done.

Life in Jordan occupied Israel, 1960\u201395 Amal was born in 1960, growing up in Wadi-el-Joz in east Jerusalem. Her father was Salim Abu Khaled al Tamimi (d. 1969), a businessman and passionate activist, and her mother Salim's second wife Nazima abu Rajabb al Tamimi (d. 1981); her siblings are Yonnes (b. 1950), Rowda (b. 1948), Safah (b. 1949), Amneh, and Salmann (b. 1955). Yonnes moved to Iceland in 1966, Amneh some years later, and Salmann in 1971.  Amal experienced the Six-Day War in 1967; the fact that Yonnes was in Iceland at the time meant that he lost his right to reside in Israel. She was politically active through most of her time in Israel. At 13 she was imprisoned pending trial for two weeks for throwing stones at Israeli soldiers, and received a six-month suspended sentence. She married for the first time at 16, and had the children Falastine (b. 1978), Fida (b. 1980), Wala (b. 1985), Majd (b. 1986), and Ahd (b. 1990), before leaving her husband after what she has described as an abusive marriage in 1995 and fleeing with her children to her brother Salmann (Suleiman) in Iceland. Later Amal said that she felt she had no rights as a woman under Shari'a Law.  In 1987, she gained a diploma in business studies via the YWCA and worked for an NGO.

There she worked as a cleaner; then in a bakery and in fish processing, and learned Icelandic. Soon she met her second partner, Hei\u00f0ar, with whom she had Bissan Inga in 1997; Amal and Hei\u00f0ar parted in 2000. Amal's partnership with a non-Arab man caused a major rift in her family, including with her brother Salmann (Suleiman), who disowned her.  In 2001, at the age of 41, Amal went to the University of Iceland, taking a BA in Social Sciences in 2004, with a BA thesis entitled 'Terrorism in Palestine: Religion or Colonial Imperialism?' In 2002, she received Icelandic citizenship (for which she had to give up Palestinain citizenship) and on 24 October 2003 founded W.O.M.E.N. (Women of Multicultural Ethnicity Network).

It employs 23% of the Filipino workforce , according to the World Bank.  The Philippines is one of the most vulnerable agricultural systems to monsoons and other extreme weather events, which are expected to create more uncertainty as climate change effects the Philippines. However, the Food and Agriculture Organization has described the local policy measures as some of the most proactive in risk reduction.  History  Profession  Grains  Rice   The Philippines is the 8th largest rice producer in the world, accounting for 2.8% of global rice production. The Philippines was also the world's largest rice importer in 2010. In 2010, nearly 15.7 million metric tons of palay (pre-husked rice) were produced. In 2010, palay accounted for 21.86% percent of gross value added in agriculture and 2.37% of GNP. Self-sufficiency in rice reached 88.93% in 2015.  Rice production in the Philippines has grown significantly since the 1950s. Improved varieties of rice developed during the Green Revolution, including at the International Rice Research Institute based in the Philippines have improved crop yields. Crop yields have also improved due to increased use of fertilizers. Average productivity increased from 1.23 metric tons per hectare in 1961 to 3.59 metric tons per hectare in 2009.  Harvest yields have increased significantly by using foliar fertilizer (Rc 62 -> 27% increase, Rc 80 -> 40% increase, Rc 64 -> 86% increase) based on PhilRice National Averages.  The government has been promoting the production of Golden rice.  The table below shows some of the agricultural products of the country per region.  Corn/maize  Corn/maize is the second most important crop in the Philippines.  600,000 farm households are employed in different businesses in the corn value chain. , around  of land is under corn cultivation and the total production was .

According to figures published in December 2015 by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, it is the world's largest producer of coconuts, producing 19,500,000 tonnes in 2015. Production in the Philippines is generally concentrated in medium-sized farms. There are 3.5 million hectares dedicated to coconut production in the Philippines, which accounts for 25 per cent of total agricultural land in the country. In 1989, it was estimated that between 25 percent and 33 percent of the population was at least partly dependent on coconuts for their livelihood. Historically, the Southern Tagalog and Bicol regions of Luzon and the Eastern Visayas were the centers of coconut production. In the 1980s, Western Mindanao and Southern Mindanao also became important coconut-growing regions.  Fruits  The Philippines is the world's third largest producer of pineapples, producing more than 2.4 million of tonnes in 2015. The Philippines was in the top three banana producing countries in 2010, including India and China. Davao and Mindanao contribute heavily to the total national banana crop. Mangoes are the third most important fruit crop of the country based on export volume and value next to bananas and pineapples.  Sugar   There are at least 19 provinces and 11 regions that produce sugarcane in the Philippines. A range from 360,000 to 390,000 hectares are devoted to sugarcane production. The largest sugarcane areas are found in the Negros Island Region, which accounts for 51% of sugarcane areas planted. This is followed by Mindanao which accounts for 20%; Luzon by 17%; Panay by 07%; and Eastern Visayas by 04%. It is estimated that , the industry provides direct employment to 700,000 sugarcane workers spread across 19 sugar producing provinces.  Sugar growing in the Philippines pre-dates colonial Spanish contact. Sugar became the most important agricultural export of the Philippines between the late eighteenth century and the mid-1970s. During the 1950s and 60s, more than 20 percent income of Philippine exports came from the sugar industry. Between 1913 and 1974, the Philippines sugar industry enjoyed favoured terms of trade with the US, with special access to the protected and subsidized the American sugar market.

The demand is still greater than the supply.  The remainder came from Ecuador (12.5%) and Costa Rica (0.1%).  The Bicol region in the Philippines produced 27,885 metric tons of abaca in 2014, the largest of any Philippine region.  The Philippine Rural Development Program (PRDP) and the Department of Agriculture reported that in 2009\u20132013, Bicol Region had 39% share of Philippine abaca production while overwhelming 92% comes from Catanduanes Island.

In 2018, the sector contributed an estimated 6.4% to the country's GDP. Agriculture is also a major source of employment. In 2016, the sector employed over 30% of the country's population. The importance of agriculture in the Philippines has been declining over the past few decades, as the country has been transitioning to a more industrialized and service-oriented economy. However, the sector continues to play a key role in the country's economy and development. The agricultural sector in the Philippines is composed of two sub-sectors: crop agriculture and animal husbandry. Crops are the major source of income for most farmers, while animal husbandry is a secondary source of income for many farmers. The country's agricultural land area is approximately 30 million hectares, which is about 30% of the country's total land area. The country's main crops include rice, coconut, sugar, bananas, pineapple, mango, and vegetables. The country's main livestock include pigs, cattle, goats, sheep, and poultry. The agricultural sector in the Philippines is facing a number of challenges, including the effects of climate change, such as extreme weather events and rising sea levels, which are damaging crops and livestock. The sector is also struggling to adapt to the country's rapidly changing demographics, as the population has been increasing and becoming more urbanized. In addition, the sector is facing competition from imports, which have been flooding the country's markets and driving down prices. Despite these challenges, the agricultural sector in the Philippines is showing signs of resilience. The sector is adapting to the changing demographics by shifting to higher-value crops and livestock, such as fruits, vegetables, and fish. The sector is also investing in new technologies and techniques to increase productivity and adapt to climate change. The government is also supporting the sector through various programs and initiatives.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 15948510}

Pellissier was born in Montaillou to a family of poor peasants.  One of a number of sons he became a shepherd as the family land would not enough to sustain all of them.  At the age of twelve, as was the custom, he began tending his family's flock of sheep.  Soon he was apprenticed in Tournon to a woman named Thomassia, likely a widow.  He worked there for five or six years before returning home and living with his widowed mother and his four brothers Raymond, Guillaume, Bernard, and Pierre.  Some years later he again left home to become a shepherd in Niort.  Staying there two years he went to Mompret for a year before again returning to Montaillou.  This time he moved in with Bernard and Guillemette Maurs and worked tending their flock, the couple's children being too young for the job.  His brother Bernard was also residing there working as a ploughboy for the couple.  The Maurs were Cathars and Jean was briefly converted to the heresy.  In 1308, however, the town of Montaillou was raided by the local inquisition and the Maurs arrested.  Jean left for the neighbouring town of Prades d'Aillon where he was hired by Bernard Malet, two months later Bernard was also imprisoned by the inquisition.  Jean remained in the employ of Malet's sons Bernard, Raymond, and Andr\u00e9.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Ajmer Dargah bombing\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Ajmer Dargah bombing (also called the Ajmer Sharif blast) occurred on 11 October 2007, in the courtyard of Sufi maulana Moinuddin Chishti in Ajmer, Rajasthan, India, after the Iftar period had started. On 22 March 2017 a Special NIA Court convicted three Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh pracharaks Devendra Gupta, Bhavesh Patel and Sunil Joshi. Sunil Joshi and Devendra Gupta were found guilty on charges of conspiracy and Bhavesh Bhai Patel was found guilty of planting the explosive on the blast site. Gupta and Patel were awarded life imprisonment. Sunil Joshi had been found shot dead in mysterious circumstances soon after the blast in Dewas, Madhya Pradesh.  Attack At 6.12\u00a0pm on 11 October 2007, an explosion occurred near a courtyard outside the Dargah of Khawaja Moinuddin Chishti in Ajmer. Evening prayers had just concluded before the end of the fasting month of Ramadan and a crowd had gathered outside the shrine to end their fast. The bomb had been concealed in a tiffin carrier, which workers typically used to store their lunch. The blast killed 3 people and injured 17 others. Remnants of a mobile phone were retrieved from the site. Lalit Maheswari of the Ajmer police stated, \"We have recovered some mobile instruments, so we think some sophisticated device was used ...\".  Investigations The Ministry of Home Affairs (India) initially stated that the blast could have been the responsibility of Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba. The media had also initially characterized the attack as part of a conflict between ultra-conservative Islamic extremists against the Sufi-derived Islamic traditions popular in India.  The focus of investigation shifted to Hindu groups when Swami Aseemanand was arrested in the Mecca Masjid blast case in Dec 2010.  On 22 October 2010, five suspects, who had been arrested by the Anti-Terrorism Squad of India, were charged with conspiracy in connection to the bombing. Four of the five suspects were connected to the Hindu nationalist organization, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh.  According to sources, Patel was part of the five-member group that planted the bomb at Ajmer Dargah. While two planters 'Harshad Solanki and Mukesh Vasani' have already been charge sheeted, Patel was part of a back-up team, including Suresh Nair and Mehul alias Mafat Bhai, which went to the site as a contingency plan to take charge of the affairs in case the two planters failed to place the bomb or developed cold feet.  On 10 October 2007, Suresh Nair, Mehul and Bhavesh Patel took a consignment of explosives from Sunil Joshi, who was later found murdered under mysterious circumstances in Godhra. They reached Vadodara on the same day and boarded a private bus for Udaipur. At Ajmer, however, the bomb was given to Solanki and Vasani planted it. Patel was also accused of having been involved in the post-Godhra riots in Gujarat, but was acquitted by the court.  NIA also filed another charge sheet against Swami Aseemanand, whose confession helped the agency open Hyderabad's Mecca Masjid blast and Malegaon 2006 blast cases, along with Sandeep Dangae, Bhawesh Patel, Mehul, Suresh Bhai, Ramchandra Kalsangra, Sunil Joshi and Bharat Bhai. According to the charge sheet filed, Swami Aseemanand conceived the plan to avenge Islamic attacks on Hindu temples.  In 2011, the Central Bureau of Investigation started investigating the Hindutva organisation, Abhinav Bharat on the basis of Aseemanands confession. Swami Aseemanand's named the co-founder of the far right Hindu organisation, Abhinav Bharat,  Prasad Shrikant Purohit and senior Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh leader Indresh Kumar among others as co-conspirators. The Swami in his statement also claimed that Sunil Joshi was the operational man and carried out the blast in Ajmer with the help of two Muslim boys from the Inter-Services Intelligence of Pakistan, who were given to him by Indresh Kumar.  Another individual accused in the attack was Bharat Bhai alias Bharat Rateshwar, who is also accused of financing several other Hindutva terrorist attacks such the Mecca Masjid blast and the 2007 Samjhauta Express bombings. He was accused of funding and planning terrorist attacks on Muslim to avenge the attacks on Hindus in India.  Conviction On 8 March 2017, a special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court in Jaipur found guilty three ex-RSS pracharaks, Bhavesh Patel, Devendra Gupta, and Sunil Joshi (who was murdered in 2007). Both Patel and Gupta were awarded life imprisonments and imposed a fine of Rs 5,000 and Rs 10,000 respectively. Swami Aseemanand and 6 other accused were acquitted, giving them the \"benefit of doubt\". At the same time, the court questioned the NIA on its clean chit to two of the other accused, Ramesh Gohil and Amit, as well as \"suspicious persons\" such as the senior RSS leader Indresh Kumar and Pragya Singh Thakur stating that it could not be done without invoking appropriate sections of CrPC. Pragya Singh Thakur later went on to be elected as Member of parliament, Lok Sabha from Bhopal in May 2019.

A bomb exploded in the Dargah Khwaja Sahib, a 14th-century shrine to a Sufi saint, during a religious festival, resulting in the death of two pilgrims and the injury of a dozen more. The shrine is located in the centre of the city, and the festival was attended by thousands of pilgrims. The blast, which occurred at around 15:45 (IST), damaged the shrine's northwest gate and left a crater on the marble flooring. The force of the blast shattered the windows of nearby buildings. The shrine was evacuated after the blast, and a crowd of thousands had gathered outside the shrine for the evening prayer. Two pilgrims were killed and at least ten others injured in the blast. An official from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh said that the shrine's secretary, Abdul Hayee, was the target of the attack. Hayee was injured in the blast, along with ten other people. A doctor at the hospital where the injured were being treated said that the injuries were not severe. The shrine's priest, Little Saint Niyaz, said that the bomb had been placed inside a plastic bag and left at the site for the past few days. He said that the bag was not checked because it was considered to be a \"good intention\". The explosion was believed to have been caused by a bomb weighing between 1 and 2 kg (2.2 and 4.4 lb). The shrine's gate was damaged by the force of the blast, and the walls were covered in blood. No group claimed responsibility for the blast, but police suspect the involvement of Students' Islamic Movement of India (SIMI), whose members had previously targeted the shrine in 2004 and 2006. The police had been warned about a possible attack on the shrine, but the alert had been sent to the police in the city of Ajmer, not the shrine. The shrine's priest had also been warned about a possible attack, but he had not been informed that the threat was still active. The attack was condemned by leaders of the Muslim community in India, including the Imam of the Dargah, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, and the Congress party. The shrine's priest said that the attack would not be forgiven, and that the shrine would not be able to forget the attack for 100 years. In December 2007, three suspects were arrested in Ujjain in connection with the blast. In August 2008, the Rajasthan Police arrested two more people in Ajmer in connection with the blast.

The page has been divided into sections based on the era in which the Go players played and the country in which they played. As this was not necessarily their country of birth, a flag of that country precedes every player's name. For a complete list of player articles, see :Category:Go players.  The important dates that this separation is based on are:  The establishment of the Four go houses at the start of the Tokugawa Shogunate.  The demise of the houses in the Meiji Period (end 19th century) followed by their replacement by the Nihon Kiin in 1924.  The start of international tournament Go in 1989  A Japanese census on Go players performed in 2002 estimates that over 24 million people worldwide play Go, most of whom live in Asia. Most of the players listed on this article are professionals, though some top level amateurs have been included. Players famous for achievements outside Go are listed in their own section.  Prior to 17th century  Wei Qi was recorded throughout the history of China. The first record of Wei Qi player was by Mencius.  China  17th through 19th centuries In the 17th, 18th and 19th century, Go was popular in both Japan (Edo period) and China (period of the Qing Dynasty). In Korea, a Go variant called Sunjang baduk was played.  Japan At the start of the Tokugawa Shogunate, four Go academies were established. This table lists all heads of these houses, as well as some that were appointed heir but died before they became head of the house. Tokugawa also established the post of Godokoro (minister of Go), which was awarded to the strongest player of a generation. Such players were dubbed Meijin (brilliant man), which was considered equal to a 9 dan professional grade. Over the 300-year period covered here, only ten players received the title of Meijin. Several other players (16 total) received the title of Jun-Meijin (half-Meijin), which is considered to equal an 8 dan professional grade and listed as such below. In some houses it was the custom that the head of the house was always named the same according to the iemoto system (\u5bb6\u5143). All heads of the house Inoue (\u4e95\u4e0a) were named Inseki (\u56e0\u78a9), heads of the house Yasui (\u5b89\u4e95 ) were named Senkaku (\u4ed9\u89d2) from the 4th head onward, and heads of the house Hayashi (\u6797) were named Monnyu (\u9580\u5165) from the second head onward. To distinguish between these players, the names listed below are the names they had before becoming head of their house, or after their retirement. The house Honinbo (\u672c\u56e0\u574a) had no such tradition, although heads would often take one character from the name of their predecessor into their own name, notably the character Shu (\u79c0) from the 14th head onward.  *All ranks are professional dan grades unless otherwise noted.  China  *Players could achieve the level of Guoshou (literally National Hand), which is best in the nation and ranked 1 pin \u54c1. This title is a derivation of Mencius description of Yi Qiu (\u5f08\u79cb), Qiu the Yi player in \u300a\u5b5f\u5b50\u00b7\u544a\u5b50\u7ae0\u53e5\u4e0a\u300b: \u4eca\u592b\u5f08\u4e4b\u4e3a\u6570\uff0c\u5c0f\u6570\u4e5f\u3002\u4e0d\u4e13\u5fc3\u81f4\u5fd7\uff0c\u5219\u4e0d\u5f97\u4e5f\u3002\u5f08\u79cb\uff0c\u901a\u56fd\u4e4b\u5584\u5f08\u8005\u4e5f\u3002\u4f7f\u5f08\u79cb\u8bf2\u4e8c\u4eba\u5f08\uff0c\u5176\u4e00\u4eba\u4e13\u5fc3\u81f4\u5fd7\uff0c\u60df\u5f08\u79cb\u4e4b\u4e3a\u542c\uff1b\u4e00\u4eba\u867d\u542c\u4e4b\uff0c\u4e00\u5fc3\u4ee5\u4e3a\u6709\u9e3f\u9e44\u5c06\u81f3\uff0c\u601d\u63f4\u5f13\u7f34\u800c\u5c04\u4e4b\uff0c\u867d\u4e0e\u4ff1\u5b66\uff0c\u5f17\u82e5\u4e4b\u77e3\uff01as being \"\u901a\u56fd\u4e4b\u5584\u5f08\u8005\", literally the finest Yi player of the whole nation. It is considered to be equal to the Japanese title of Meijin.  The term Qi Sheng (\u68cb\u5723) was first mentioned by Ge Hong (\u845b\u6d2a) in \u300a\u62b1\u6734\u5b50\u300b\uff1a\u201c\u68cb\u4e4b\u65e0\u654c\u8005\uff0c\u5219\u8c13\u4e4b\u68cb\u5723\u3002\u201d The literal meaning is the Invincible Qi player is called the Saint of Qi (Qi Sheng).  Note that both Guoshou and Qisheng were not tournament winner titles; instead they were honorific titles used by Wei Qi players and historians respectively to refer to the best players who were invincible in highest graded tournaments. Guoshou was the normal term used to refer to the promo player while he was alive, whereas Qisheng was used more as posthumous fame.  The ranking of players began in West Han Dynasty (2nd century BCE) and formally recognized by the Governments during the North and South Dynasties Period (3rd to 6th century CE). There were 9 ranks called pin \u54c1 in the system, the same as the ranking system for government officials. The lowest rank was 9 pin, then 8 pin, etc. up to 1 pin. The difference of the lower 5 pin was about 1 zi (\u5b50, piece or stone), and the difference between the top 4 pin was half zi.  20th century  Japan  Women  China  Note: China formally adopted dan ranking in the early 1980s.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Duke Huan of Qi\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Duke Huan of Qi (; died 643 BC), personal name Xi\u01ceob\u00e1i (\u5c0f\u767d), was the ruler of the State of Qi from 685 to 643 BC. Living during the chaotic Spring and Autumn period, as the Zhou dynasty's former vassal states fought each other for supremacy, Duke Huan and his long-time advisor Guan Zhong managed to transform Qi into China's most powerful polity. Duke Huan was eventually recognized by most of the Zhou states as well as the Zhou royal family as Hegemon of China. In this position, he fought off invasions of China by non-Zhou peoples and attempted to restore order throughout the lands. Toward the end of his more than forty-year-long reign, however, Duke Huan's power began to decline as he grew ill and Qi came to be embroiled in factional strife. Following his death in 643 BC, Qi completely lost its predominance.  Early life and rise to power  Xi\u01ceob\u00e1i was born as one of Duke Xi of Qi's sons, though not in line of succession for the throne as he had at least two older brothers: Zhu'er and Jiu. In his youth, Xi\u01ceob\u00e1i was tutored by Bao Shuya. When Duke Xi eventually died, Zhu'er became Qi's next ruler as \"Duke Xiang\" but his reign was fraught with internal conflicts and scandals. Recognizing this and fearing for his pupil's life, Bao Shuya took Xi\u01ceob\u00e1i and fled with him to the state of Ju where they went on to live in exile.  Duke Xiang was assassinated in 686 BC, which allowed his cousin, Wuzhi, to ascend the throne. After just one month in office, however, Wuzhi was also murdered. With these two dead, Xi\u01ceob\u00e1i returned to Qi with the goal of becoming the next duke. He faced opposition in the form of his older brother Jiu however. Prince Jiu, by then also in exile, managed to gain the support of several high-ranking officials in Qi, his tutor Guan Zhong and Duke Zhuang of Lu. Before Jiu could be installed as new duke of Qi, however, Xi\u01ceob\u00e1i managed to seize control of Qi's government as well as its army, and was crowned as \"Duke Huan of Qi\" in 685 BC. The army of Lu under Duke Zhuang promptly invaded in order to install Prince Jiu on the throne, but the invading force suffered a crushing defeat at Ganshi and had to retreat. Qi's army under Bao Shuya in turn invaded Lu, and demanded Jiu and his supporters be handed over. To appease Duke Huan, Duke Zhuang then executed the rogue prince and delivered Guan Zhong to Qi as a prisoner.  Reign  Rise to hegemon  Though he was now secure on the throne, the question that remained for Duke Huan was what to do with Guan Zhong who had so prominently supported his rival brother. Bao Shuya asked his newly crowned ruler to not just spare Guan Zhong, but to even employ him as chief minister due to his great talents. Duke Huan followed this advice, and Guan Zhong became his most important and capable advisor. The two went on to reorganize Qi's government and society, dividing both the land as well as the people into regulated units and enforcing a meritocratic system of governance. This greatly strengthened Qi, as it allowed the state to \"mobilize human and material resources more effectively than other Zhou states, which remained loosely structured.\" As Qi had already been a powerful polity in a favorable strategic situation before, these reforms managed to bring Qi to \"an unprecedented status of leadership in the entire Zhou world\". Together, Duke Huan and Guan Zhong worked toward achieving dominance over the other Zhou states, and as time went on ever more of them became followers of Qi.  Hegemony  Eventually Duke Huan invited the rulers of Lu, Song, Chen, and Zheng to a conference in 667 BC, where they elected him as their leader. After hearing of this, King Hui of Zhou appointed Duke Huan hegemon (ba) with the authority to operate militarily in the name of the royal court. Duke Huan and Guan Zhong envisioned the office of \"hegemon\" not just as mere position of military power, but rather as one that was supposed to \"restore the authority of the Son of Heaven\" or, more practically, restabilize the old realm of the Zhou dynasty under the leadership of Qi.  Consequently, Duke Huan intervened in matters that concerned the interstate relationships of the Zhou polities, both on behalf of King Hui as well as to assert his own position as hegemon. Such interventions included a punitive expedition against Wey in 671 BC, because this state had defied King Hui, as well as involvement in a power struggle in Lu in order to cement Qi's power. Another major concern for Duke Huan was the threat that outside powers (derogatorily called the \"Four Barbarians\") posed to the Zhou states, and he would launch numerous campaigns to fend off these \"barbarians\". Most notably, he saved the states of Yan, Xing and Wey from invasions by non-Zhou groups, and tried to stop the expansion of Chu in the south. In 656 BC he led an alliance of eight states against a satellite state of Chu, Cai, and defeated it. The alliance then proceeded to invade Chu itself, and eventually a pact was concluded. Chu stopped its northward expansion and agreed to take part in an compulsory interstate meeting at Shaoling. This meeting, the first of its kind, set a precedent.  Over the following years, Duke Huan convened numerous interstate meetings under the auspices of the Zhou royal family. Points of discussion during these meetings ranged from military matters to economics to general orders concerning governance and laws. Overall, the ruler of Qi managed to restore some stability in the volatile and fractious Zhou realm. Historian Cho-yun Hsu summarizes that Duke Huan \"used his Ba [hegemon] leadership to set up a new order for an interstate community that was to be guarded by consensus rather than authority.\"  Decline in power and death   After almost forty years on the throne, however, Duke Huan's dominance began to gradually decline. His efforts to completely stop Chu's expansion failed, as the southern state had simply shifted its attention from the north to the east. There, along the Huai River, Chu conquered or invaded several states allied with Qi. The last major anti-Chu military alliance assembled by Duke Huan failed to stop this development, and was even defeated during the Battle of Loulin in 645 BC. Guan Zhong also died in that year, depriving the ruler of Qi of his most important advisor. Having grown ill, Duke Huan was increasingly ignored by the leaders of other states, and even his authority over Qi itself declined as various political factions began to vie for power.  These factions were formed by high officials as well as six of the duke's sons. These six, namely Zhao, Wukui, Pan, Shangren, Yuan, and Yong, were all the children of different concubines, as Duke Huan's three main wives bore him no sons. As a result, all of them felt themselves entitled to the throne. Though Qi's ruler had designated Prince Zhao as his heir and even charged Duke Xiang of Song with ensuring that he would ascend the throne, this did not stop the other five from plotting their own rise to power. According to the Guanzi, the elderly duke had also to deal with four powerful officials: Tang Wu, the court sorcerer; Yiya, the chief cook; Shu Diao, the chief of the eunuchs; and Gongzi Kaifang, a leading courtier. Shortly before his death, Guan Zhong had advised that they should be sent into exile. Duke Huan did so, but he found himself missing their particular talents at the court and allowed them to return. They then conspired against him, and locked him in his room, secretly starving him to death. Other notable sources for these events, such as the Zuo Zhuan and the Records of the Grand Historian do not mention this purported assassination.  Duke Huan of Qi finally died in late 643 BC, and the capital Linzi quickly descended into violence. His six sons, supported by various officials, took up arms against each other in order to size the throne, starting a war of succession. In this chaos, Duke Huan could not be buried and his corpse was left unattended in his bedchamber for between seven days and three months. By the time he was finally encoffined, the corpse had begun to rot. With Duke Huan's sons fighting for the throne, Qi was severely weakened and lost its status as China's predominant state. Although Zhao, by then ruling as Duke Xiao of Qi, eventually attempted to regain his father's hegemony, he failed and Duke Wen of Jin became the next hegemon.

Backend types  Mnesia has three inbuilt table types: ram_copies, disc_copies and disc_only_copies.  Ram_copies  Data resides in memory and table size is limited by available memory and are backed by ETS (erlang term storage) table.  Disc_copies  Data resides in memory but is also persisted on disk backed by disk_log. Disc_copies were backed by Dets tables until 30th September 2001 with the release of R7B-4.  Disc_only_copies  Data resides only on disc and are backed by Dets (disk version of ETS). Dets file format uses signed 32-bit integers for file offsets and has a limit of 2GB so do disc_only_copies.  Backend plugins  Due to limits imposed by Dets, support for other backend plugins was suggested by Ulf Wiger and these were added to Mnesia. Klarna added the LevelDB backend plugin while Aeternity added the RocksDB backend plugin.  Relational features  The database model is relational, but isn't what someone familiar with SQL might expect. A database contains tables. Relationships between them are modelled as other tables.  A key feature of Mnesia's high-availability approach is that tables can be reconfigured within a schema and relocated between nodes, not only while the database is still running, but even while write operations are still going on.  Coding   The query language of Mnesia is Erlang itself, rather than SQL. It permits easy representation of transactions as a natural feature of Erlang by allowing developers to utilize a single language throughout an application.  Transactions  Erlang is a functional language. Mnesia builds on this to obtain ACID transaction support. The functional block which is run as a transaction is a commonplace Erlang construct called a Functional Object (or Fun) and is called by the single Mnesia statement mnesia:transaction(F). This can lead to clearer source code than the paired BEGIN / COMMIT syntax of SQL, and so avoids its problem of unclosed transactions within a procedure.  Again as a result of the functional nature of Erlang, nesting transactions is simple. It's also possible to distribute transactions across multiple nodes (i.e. separate servers). The semantics of using transactions in this way remains consistent, making it easy to write library code that works equally in either context.  General coding style for Mnesia will always use transactions. For performance reasons, it also supports deliberate \"dirty operations\" which avoid transactions. These compromise the atomicity and the isolation properties of ACID, but offer around 10\u00d7 more throughput. In addition there are also in-memory alternatives, although these lose the durability property of ACID.  Efficient execution  Mnesia forms part of the LYME web application stack. This is akin to LAMP, but based on Erlang. Implementation in Erlang confers an efficiency benefit because of the use of a single virtual machine throughout an application. LYME makes use of this, since the Yaws web server is also implemented in Erlang.  Address space is shared (although safely so, under Erlang) between code and data, including Mnesia's table data.  Origins and licensing  Mnesia and Erlang were developed by the Ericsson Computer Science Laboratory. They have been released as open source software. Mnesia is released under a derivative of the Mozilla Public License. Since OTP 18.0 they are published according to the open source Apache License 2.0. Versions before OTP 18.0 were published under the open source Erlang Public License.  ejabberd  Mnesia is also an option embedded within the Erlang-based Jabber daemon, ejabberd.

It can be used as a distributed database, with multiple nodes (computers) running Mnesia and sharing data. The database can also be used as a local database, with data stored on a single node. The Mnesia database is transactional, which means that all changes to the database are made as part of a single transaction. This ensures that the database remains consistent, even if there is a power failure or other problem. The database is also recoverable, which means that if there is a problem, it can be restored to a previous state.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Omicron Delta Kappa\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Omicron Delta Kappa (), also known as The Circle and ODK,  is one of the most prestigious honor societies in the United States with chapters at more than 300 college campuses. It was founded December 3, 1914, at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia, by 15 student and faculty leaders. The society recognizes achievement in five areas: scholarship; athletics; campus and community service, social or religious activities, and campus government; journalism, speech and the mass media; and creative and performing arts. Some circles of \u039f\u0394\u039a are quasi-secret, in that newly selected members remain undisclosed for some time.  Membership in the Omicron Delta Kappa Society is regarded as one of the highest collegiate honors that can be awarded, in the tradition of Phi Kappa Phi and Phi Beta Kappa.  To be selected as a member of \u039f\u0394\u039a, one must stand among the top 35 percent of all students at that particular institution and hold a leadership role in one of the society's five areas of recognition.  History  Founding On the evening of December 3, 1914, the Omicron Delta Kappa Society was founded by fifteen men who gathered in a small office on the third floor of Reid Hall on the campus of Washington and Lee University. J.\u00a0Carl Fisher first introduced the idea of creating such a society to a close friend, Rupert Latture.  The two soon included mutual friend William Brown in the discussion, and thus these three are referred to as the principal founders of the society.  Together with three faculty members, including the president of the University and the dean of Engineering, they gradually selected nine others to join them. The complete list of the fifteen founders is as follows.  James Edwin Bear, \u0392\u0398\u03a0, editor of the student magazine William Moseley Brown, \u0394\u039a\u0395, \u03a6\u0392\u039a, debater, a president of the YMCA Carl Shaffer Davidson, \u039a\u03a3, student instructor in civil engineering Edward Parks Davis, \u039a\u03a3, athlete Edward A. Donahue, \u03a6\u039a\u03a3, captain of football and baseball De la Warr Benjamin Easter, PhD, \u039a\u03a3, \u03a6\u0392\u039a, professor, and the founding president of \u039f\u0394\u039a James Carl Fisher, business manager of the student magazine, founder of the campus radio station Philip Pendleton Gibson, \u03a0\u039a\u0391, president of student government, editor of the student newspaper Thomas McPheeters Glasgow, \u03a6\u0394\u0398, orator, athlete David Carlisle Humphreys, FIJI, professor and dean of the School of Applied Science Rupert Nelson Latture, \u0394\u03a5, \u03a6\u0392\u039a, a president of the YMCA John Eppes Martin, \u0391\u03a7\u03a1, business manager of the year book William Caulfield Raftery, \u03a6\u039a\u03a3, athlete John Purver Richardson, Jr., \u03a3\u03a7, instructor in biology Henry Louis Smith, PhD, \u03a6\u0394\u0398, \u03a6\u0392\u039a, president of Washington and Lee University  All 15 men were prominent leaders on campus, and they rallied around the idea that all-around leadership in college should be recognized, that representative men in all phases of college life should cooperate in worthwhile endeavor, and that outstanding students and faculty should affiliate in the spirit of mutual interest and understanding. The founders intended that \u039f\u0394\u039a not be yet another society in which members would simply earn a societal Key and then be done.  Members of \u039f\u0394\u039a would remain active as leaders, in upholding spiritual and moral values, and in rendering service to the campus and community.  The founders decided that The Circle would be kept a complete secret until keys could be designed and produced. The keys arrived shortly  past the winter holiday, and each man first wore his key on the 15th of January in 1915. The student newspaper, the Ring-Tum Phi, broke the news in the issue dated January 12, 1915 of a new society to be known as \"The Circle,\" with the secret significance of its three Greek letters known only to its members.  Purpose of the Society The Purpose of the Society is threefold:  First, to recognize those who have attained a high standard of efficiency in collegiate activities and to inspire others to strive for conspicuous attainments along similar lines;  Second, to bring together the most representative students in all phases of collegiate life and thus to create an organization which will help to mold the sentiment of the institution on questions of local and intercollegiate interest;  Third, to bring together members of the faculty and student body of the institution, as well as other Omicron Delta Kappa members, in the spirit of mutual interest and understanding.  Women in ODK Only men could become members of Omicron Delta Kappa in the first 60 years of its existence. At the 1970 and 1972 National Conventions, the University of Alabama Circle introduced an amendment to the National Constitution to admit women into the Society.  In June 1972, Title IX of the \"Education Amendments Act of 1972\" prohibited sex discrimination in federally assisted educational programs and amended parts of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Professional and honor fraternities were included in Title IX. The Special Committee on the Possible Role of Women met in January 1973 and recommended changes to the National Constitution that would abolish segregation based on gender within the Society. On March 12, 1974. the National Convention convened in New Orleans and approved the initiation of women into the Society. On that date, the first women members were recognized by the Society. They were the Carolyn Julia Kucinski and Diane Christine Ragosa of the Newark College of Engineering Circle, and Robbie Lynn Cooney, Maria Dolores Delvalle, Roxane R. Dow, Catherine Ann Rohrbacher, Karen Diane Janzer, Linda Ann Touten, Martha Gwyn Van Deman, and Cathy Sue Welch of the  University of South Florida Circle.  Cheryl Hogle was elected as the first woman National President at the Convention in Knoxville, Tennessee on February 25, 1998. After serving four terms as a Faculty Province Director and two terms as National Vice President for Extension, she was elected by unanimous vote of the Convention. On June 26, 2010, the ODK National Leadership Summit and Convention elected Dr. Betsy Holloway as the 34th National President, the second female to be elected.  On March 22, 1992, the National Convention passed a resolution authorizing the incorporation of the Society. On July 1, 1992, the Omicron Delta Kappa Society was merged into the corporation, The Omicron Delta Kappa Society, Inc.  Omicron Delta Kappa had been a member of the ACHS since , but resigned that membership in .  Today it participates in a more loosely coordinated lobbying association of four of the nation's oldest and most prestigious honor societies, all independent, called the Honor Society Caucus.  Its members include Phi Beta Kappa, Phi Kappa Phi, Sigma Xi, and Omicron Delta Kappa.  Relationship with Mortar Board A similar honorary society, for exceptionally outstanding women leaders, known as Mortar Board, had been established just a few years after ODK, in 1918, with many similar ideals and purposes.  With the passage of Title IX in 1972, each of those two societies was then required to accept candidates of either gender into its membership.  As a result, the two organizations found themselves competing to tap many of the same distinguished students, and those formerly complementary societies became rivals at many institutions, perhaps fiercely so during membership selection, while more congenially so during the rest of the year, as the two rivaled one another in service, athletics, or other campus activities.  Membership selection Unlike the college honor societies that accept all potential members who meet the selection criteria and pay the required fees, O\u2206K chooses only a highly select group from a pool of potential and qualified students through a process known as tapping.  Eligibility for membership in O\u2206K requires at least sophomore academic standing.  Unlike Phi Beta Kappa, which limits membership to the liberal arts and sciences, O\u2206K contemplates candidates from every field of study who distinguish themselves as outstanding leaders in at least one of the five areas celebrated by O\u2206K:  scholarship; athletics; campus and community service, social or religious activities, and campus government; journalism, speech and the mass media; and creative and performing arts.  Members may be chosen either annually or semi-annually depending on the tradition of each individual circle.  The number of candidates  tapped each year is limited to thirty five percent of the undergraduate population, but most circles limit membership to fewer than the top one quarter of one percent of the students on their respective campuses.  Once a circle votes on who will be tapped for membership, it withholds that secret from all but those few chosen for initiation.  Once tapped, each candidate must maintain the secret until the circle reveals it to the campus and community in a public ceremony, only after the circle has initiated the new members into the bonds of the society through its private ritual.  At some institutions, such as the University of Missouri, with several such elite societies that tap new members, the public revelations are all held in conjunction, in an annual ceremonial Tap Day celebration on campus.  Circles  Omicron Delta Kappa uses the term circle to indicate chapters. As of October 24, 2021, 425 circles have been chartered. The practice of designating circles with Greek letter names was abandoned in 1949.  Members who have died are said to have entered the Eternal Circle.

Hopkins. The purpose of the society is to recognize college students who have shown leadership and scholarship in the areas of leadership, athletics, campus service, journalism, or creative and performing arts. The national office is located in Lexington, Virginia, and is directed by a national executive director. The society's national council is comprised of the national executive director, a vice president for each of the five founding pillars, a representative from each of the 50 states, and a representative from each of the 10 Canadian provinces. State and provincial chapters are led by student governors, who are advised by faculty advisors. The name Omicron Delta Kappa was derived from the initial letters of the Greek words meaning \"little sister of.\" The men of the society were called \"bigs\" and the women were called \"littles.\" In 1975, the society became co-ed and the letter \"K\" was added to the name to represent the new \"little brothers of.\" The Greek letter Omicron represents the word \"little\" and Delta Kappa represents the words \"brother and sister.\" The society's flower is the red carnation, and its colors are crimson and gold. The purposes of the society are to promote and recognize scholarship and achievement in the five founding pillars: Leadership Athletics Campus Service Journalism Creative and Performing Arts The society's members are selected on the basis of leadership and scholarship in these five areas. The national office does not set specific membership criteria for individual chapters, although most chapters require a minimum GPA of 2.5. The society's membership includes over 300,000 active members in over 500 chapters. The society's national programs include the National Leadership Conference, the Regional Leadership Conferences, the National Convention, and the annual Circle of Omicron Delta Kappa. The National Leadership Conference is held annually in Indianapolis, Indiana, and is attended by over 400 students from across the country. The conference, which is held in October, is designed to give student leaders an opportunity to learn from and interact with prominent leaders in a wide range of fields. In addition to the National Leadership Conference, the society sponsors three Regional Leadership Conferences each year. These conferences are designed for regional student leaders and are held in the spring in the Northeast, Southeast, and Midwest. The National Convention is held annually in July at the society's national office in Lexington, Virginia. At the convention, the society's national council meets to conduct business and to elect new officers. The society's annual Circle of Omicron Delta Kappa is held each year in the spring at the national office. The Circle of Omicron Delta Kappa is a leadership workshop designed specifically for the society's regional and state officers.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Electricity provider switching\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Electricity provider switching is the ability of power consumers to have an option to choose their electricity provider in a deregulated electricity market as permitted by a state public utilities governing body.  Australia The Australian market has been somewhat deregulated, but still sees consumers provided with a narrow band of choices.  Canada Electricity is deregulated in two Canadian provinces: Ontario and Alberta. Both markets showed price spikes in the first year of deregulation, but then settled down into a volatile but reasonably stable environment. Alberta's market is dominated by fossil fuel generation and as such reacts more closely to the price of natural gas. Ontario's generation mix is about 50% nuclear.  Ontario The consumer has the choice between buying from their local utility (Local Distribution Company - LDC) or from one of the deregulated suppliers.   There is a large range of contract options from a variable price to 1,3 or 5 year fixed prices.   Electricity provider switching is difficult once the consumer is in one of these contracts, unless they are close to the end of a fixed price contract.   However, as of January 2010 there is a maximum termination penalty allowed.  A very important element in switching electricity providers in Ontario is understanding the Global Adjustment.  This is an adjustment for some commitments government agencies have made on your behalf. It is included in the LDC Regulated Price Plan, but is an additional line item if a contract is signed.  Alberta The consumer has the choice between buying from their local utility (Local Distribution Company - LDC) or from a deregulated suppliers. There are however many fewer of these in Alberta. Electricity provider switching is difficult once the consumer is in one of these contracts, unless they are close to the end of a fixed price contract.  There is a price comparison service operation in Canada.  France  In France, electricity market is totally deregulated and consumers have the choice between the historical formerly state-owned provider EDF and several new private providers like Direct \u00c9nergie.  United Kingdom Electricity supply has also been deregulated in the United Kingdom.  United States In deregulated markets such as Texas and Maryland, the state government may require the incumbent utility energy provider to allow for unlimited competition within the marketplace, where the consumer is free to choose any electricity provider. Electricity provider switching is only practical if a customer is either buying from a utility or is at the end of a fixed-price contract with a provider.  Certain U.S. states allow for consumer choice in electricity providers, with Texas being the most-widely watched deregulatory scheme.  Many other states are surveying the Texas deregulatory model in order to use its design as a model for the imposition of free market forces within such other power markets.  As of 2019, 19 U.S. states and the District of Columbia have \"either full or partial retail choice.\" Along with aforementioned Maryland and Texas, electricity deregulation is current in Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island. Seven additional U.S. states began the process of electricity deregulation but have suspended efforts: Arizona, Arkansas, California, Nevada, New Mexico, Virginia, and Wyoming.  In 2019, Arizona's regulatory agency (Arizona Corporation Commission) considered implementing retail electricity deregulation. The proposal was opposed by Arizona Public Service Co. (APS), an electric utility that provides electricity to 2.7 million people. APS said it was opposed because the change would \"not be in the best interest of customers\" because it would create issues surrounding reliability, \"conflicts . . . with existing law,\" and clean energy implementation difficulties.

These providers may use different energy sources (e.g. coal, oil, nuclear, hydroelectric, solar, wind) and different technologies (e.g. combined cycle, coal combustion, diesel generators, nuclear fission, solar thermal, wind turbines) to generate electricity. Choosing the best provider is a complex process. The consumer must generally consider the following factors: Electricity rates: The price per kilowatt hour (kWh) Price structure: The way the price per kWh changes with consumption Time of use: Whether or not there are different rates at different times of day or year Minimum charge: The minimum charge for a period (e.g. monthly) Departure charge: The charge per kWh if the consumer leaves the provider before the contract finishes Other charges: Any other charges such as late payment or reconnection fees For consumers who wish to switch to a different provider, the process is generally as follows: The consumer contacts the new provider to arrange for the switch The new provider and the old provider arrange for the switch to take place The switch is effected, usually on a date arranged between the providers The consumer pays any outstanding charges to the old provider How to switch Contact the new provider If you are on a fixed-term contract, check if there is a fee for leaving before the end of the contract. Most providers will require you to give at least one business day notice before you can switch. arrange for the switch Your new provider will arrange for your electricity to be disconnected from the old provider and reconnected to the new provider. You may have to pay an 'exit fee' to the old provider if you're still in a contract period. The switch can usually be made within 1-3 business days of you contacting the new provider.

This Theyyam is deified by Mavilan, Koppalan and Vannan communities and is done with the cooperation of Hindus and Muslims. The characters of this theyyam are mostly spirits of Mappilas that are related to the local deities. The common names of male Mappila theyyams are Aali, Aandi, Mukri, Poker, Bappiriyan, Kunhali, Mammu, Mammad etc. Ummachi and Naithiyar are the common names attributed to female theyyams.The dialogues of Mappila theyyams have mentions about Islamic migration to Kerala in the 7th century and communal harmony.  Legend  The origins of the legend of Mappila Theyyam traces to the kuladevata temple of Kamballur Kottayil Tharavad in Chittarikkal, Kasaragod district. The main deity of the temple is Karinchamundi however, as per folklore the spirit of an mukri of nearby Pulingome Mosque named Kalanthan who died under mysterious circumstances in nearby river is also merged with the main deity. In the annual theyyam proceedings of this temple Kalanthan mukri is represented as Mappila Theyyam along with the Chamundi theyyam. The mappila theyyam starts the divine act by offering banku (prayer call) and offering namaz. It has less ornamentation, facial drawings and captive head gears than Chamundi theyyakolam. This art form represents the syncretism of Mappila Muslims and harmony between Muslims and Hindus that existed in the region since olden times. The ritual traditions of Pulingome Mosque also has similar harmonious elements. The annual Makham Uroos conducted in the mosque begins with cooperation of seniors of Kamballur Kottayil Tharavadu.  Other Mappila Theyyam  There are almost fifteen Mappila Theyyams that are practiced across areas that were under Kolathunadu in Kasaragod district and parts of Kannur district. . The most famous among them besides Kamballur Kottayil Chamundi theyyam are,   Aalitheyyam practiced in Kumbla performed by members of Vannan caste is linked with the legend of Naduvilan tharavad, Arikady.

Theyyam is a dance in which the artist plays the role of a deity by dressing up and impersonating the deity. It is believed that the tradition of Theyyam is over 1000 years old. The dance is performed to propitiate the deity. The Mappila Theyyam is performed by a group of people in a large open ground. A Theyyam artist is also called a Theyyan. The traditional dress of the Mappila Theyyan is a white dhoti and a long black coat. Theyyan can be easily identified by his mask, which is called kolam or angengolam. Theyyan also wears several accessories like earrings, bracelets, armlets, finger rings, and waist belts. Mappila Theyyam is performed during the month of Ramadan. The tradition of performing Theyyam every year began during the time of the second Caliph of Islam, Omar. It is believed that when the Prophet Muhammad migrated from Mecca to Madina, he gave the responsibility of collecting taxes from the Arabian peninsula to his companion Omar. At that time, there was a large trade relationship between the Arabs and the people of Kerala. The business communities of Kerala were mainly Muslims and the chief among them were the Mappilas. The Mappilas were a coastal Muslim community in Kerala. They were expert sailors and were involved in the spice trade with the Arabs. It is said that during the month of Ramadan, the Mappilas were not allowed to eat or drink anything during the day. As the Mappilas were engaged in trade and were in the sea for months, it was difficult for them to observe the Ramadan fast. The Mappilas requested the Caliph to give them a special permission to observe the Ramadan fast. The Caliph accepted their request and asked them to observe the Ramadan fast according to the Lunar calendar and not the Solar calendar. The Mappilas were very happy and they celebrated the event by performing Theyyam. Since then, the Mappilas have been observing the Ramadan fast according to the Lunar calendar. The Mappila Theyyam is performed in a large open ground called the Kootham. The Kootham is cleaned and decorated with flowers and lights. A small structure is made in the middle of the Kootham, where the Theyyan performs the dance. The Mappila Theyyan is accompanied by a group of people playing musical instruments like the harmonium, tabla, ganjira, and elaeppe. The Theyyan performs the dance by holding a small drum, which is called the duff. The dance begins with the Theyyan performing the Salawath, which is the traditional Muslim prayer. After the Salawath, the Theyyan begins the main dance by moving his body in a series of rhythmic movements. The Theyyan then performs the Sammam, which is a combination of movements and poses. The Theyyan then performs the Jinnah, which is a combination of a dance and a song. The Jinnah is performed in a sitting position and the Theyyan sings and beats the duff simultaneously. The last part of the Mappila Theyyam is the Final, which is a combination of all the previous dances. The Final is performed in a standing position and the Theyyan sings and dances simultaneously. After the Final, the Theyyan performs the Salawath again and the dance comes to an end. The Mappila Theyyam is a traditional dance and is performed with a lot of zeal and enthusiasm.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 67646393}

Its official full name is meningioma (disrupted in balanced translocation) 1 because it is disrupted by a balanced translocation (4;22) in a meningioma.  Function  MN1 is a transcription coregulator that enhances or represses gene expression through direct or indirect interaction with the gene regulatory machinery. Reported interactions include the BAF (SWI/SNF) complex. RAC3 and p300.  MN1 can act as a coactivator of several transcription factors, including RAR/RXR and the vitamin D receptor. In AML, MN1 binds to genomic sites enriched for binding motifs of ETS factors as well as hematopoietic transcription factors such as RUNX1, GATA2, HOXA cluster genes, and MEIS1. MN1 induces a hematopoietic stem and progenitor gene expression program centered on HOXA cluster genes, particularly HOXA9 and MEIS1 via its interaction with the BAF complex  Clinical significance   The translocation of MN1 was first reported in meningioma. A substantial percentage of primitive neuro-ectodermal tumors (PNET)  have MN1 translocations Several different partners were described, although in many cases no fusion partner was identified. MN1 transloations also occur in up to 2% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) Described fusion partners include ETV6, STAT3 and FLI1. About 50% of fusions are out of frame and result in high expression of MN1 via enhancer hijacking.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Cumulative inequality theory\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Cumulative inequality theory or Cumulative Disadvantage Theory is the systematic explanation of how inequalities develop. The theory was initially developed by Merton (1988), who studied the sciences and prestige. He believed that recognition from peers, and from published research in the scientific field created cumulative advantage (see Matthew affectMatthew effect)  that led to the receipt of resources that facilitated research projects. The theory expanded in four decades to include the idea that some people have more disadvantages than advantages which influence the quality of life of societies, cohorts, and individuals.  The theory is principally a social scientific explanation of phenomena but with links to biological and health factors, personal adjustment, and well-being.  A central premise is that \u201csocial systems generate inequality, which is manifested over the life course via demographic and developmental processes.\u201d  Development and application   The ideas of this theory were developed by Kenneth Ferraro and colleagues as an integrative or middle-range theory.  Originally specified in five axioms and nineteen propositions, cumulative inequality theory incorporates elements from the following theories and perspectives, several of which are related to the study of society: Robert Merton articulated the Matthew effect to explain accumulating advantage  Glen Elder\u2019s life course perspective  Stress process theory  Age stratification theory.  In recent years, Ferraro and several other researchers have been testing and elaborating elements of the theory on a variety of topics to provide evidence for the theoretical framework. In the following information you will find some of the uses of this theory in sociological studies.  McDonough, Worts, Booker, et al (2015) for example studied cumulative disadvantage in the generations of health inequality among mothers in Britain and the United States.  The study examined   \u201cif adverse circumstances early in the life course cumulate as health harming biographical patterns across working and family caregiving years.\u201d  Also, it was examined if institutional context moderated cumulative effects of micro level processes. The results showed that existing health disparities of women in midlife, during work and family rearing time, were intensified by cumulative disadvantages caused by adversities in early life. Thus, the accumulation of disadvantage had negative connotations for the well-being of women's occupational experiences and family life.  McLean (2010), on the other hand, studied U.S combat and non combat veterans through cumulative disadvantage. He discovered that cumulated negative disadvantages caused by disability and unemployment were more likely to influence the lives of combat veterans versus non combat veterans. Combat veterans suffered physical and emotional trauma that had a disabling effect which impeded their ability to successfully obtain employment. . The research is crucial for social policy implementation that assist United States Veterans to find and retain employment that is suitable to their personal conditions.  In continuation, Woolredge, Frank, Coulette, et al. ( 2016) studied the prison sentencing of racial groups. specifically of African American males with prior felony convictions. They examined how pre-trial processes affect trial outcomes. It was determined that cumulative disadvantage was existent for African American males and young men; the results were measured by: set bail amounts, pre-trial detention, prison sentencing, and no reduction in sentencing length. The research are striving to create changes in the justice system that reduce incarceration rates of African American Males by reducing bail amounts, and pre trial imprisonment. Further studies are important to decrease the incarceration of minority groups in society, and to create a non biased justice system.   Additionally, Ferraro & Moore (2003) have applied the theory to the study of long-term consequences of early obesity for midlife health and socioeconomic attainment. The study shows that obesity experienced in early life leads to lower-body disability, but higher risk factors to health. Moreover. The research mentions a risk that has been brought to attention in the past years; it ties being over weight to negative stigma (DeJong 1980),and has influenced fair labor market positioning and wages.  Lastly, Crystal, Shea, & Reyes (2016) studied the effects of cumulative advantage in increasing within age cohort economic inequalities in diverse periods of time. The study utilized economic patterns such as annual wealth value and household size. The inequalities of age were analyzed by using the gini coefficient.  The study took place between 1980 and 2010. The results showed that at age 65 plus individuals had higher rates of inequality and it increased significantly for baby boomers or during economic recession and times of war. The research is written to estimate the possible impacts of social security changes on older adults in American Society.  In conclusion, Cumulative Inequality or Cumulative Disadvantage Theory, is broadly examining various topics that impact public policy, and the view of our role within society. Further benefits of the theory are still to be seen in the next coming years.  Core ideas   According to Ferraro and Shippee, there are five main ideas in cumulative inequality or Cumulative Disadvantage Theory, which include:  \u201cAxiom 1: Social systems generate inequality, which is manifested over the life course through demographic and developmental processes. Axiom 2:  Disadvantage increases exposure to risk, but advantage increases exposure to opportunity. Axiom 3: Life course trajectories are shaped by the accumulation of risk, available resources, and human agency. Axiom 4:  The perception of life trajectories influences subsequent trajectories Axiom 5:  Cumulative inequality may lead to premature mortality; therefore, nonrandom selection may give the appearance of decreasing inequality in later life.\u201d  Axiom 1  Ferraro, K.F., & Shippee, T.P. (2009) stated that social structures shape human behavior and interpersonal relations. Furthermore, cumulation in childhood experiences shape life outcomes sometimes in negative ways.  Inequality is, therefore,  not a randomly determined misfortune, but rather a predestined state that one is born into. Although it is possible for inequality to come from an individual's own actions consequences, that is not always true. One's childhood experiences and conditions should also be taken into consideration since these experiences help mold a young individual into an adult.  Axiom 2  Ferraro, K.F., & Shippee, T.P. (2009) want us to consider that cumulative advantage and disadvantage are not different they are merely opposite ends of the spectrum. Cumulative Disadvantage is perceived as a risk whereas Cumulative Advantage is an opportunity.  A well-known concept in sociological sources is that individuals with advantages, whether they are achieved or born into, have a higher rate of opportunity in life. On the contrary, those with many disadvantages are more susceptible to risks throughout their life. For example, one who is born into the majority race with well-educated parents in a developed area will have more exposure to opportunity, whether it be getting a job through one of their parents' college friends or going to a highly rated high school and then being able to get into a highly accredited college. But, on the contrary, one who is born into a minority race with parents who may not have finished high school and live in the ghettos of the roughest town in the city may, not only have less exposure to opportunities, but more exposure to risks such as violence and crime.  Axiom 3  Ferraro, K.F., & Shippee, T.P. (2009) state that even though previous life events are important, the overall quality of life is determined by frequently changing trajectories, or the long-term changes in life stability, which are created by an individual's resources, risks, and human agencies. Human agencies simply refer to an individual's own ability to act and think on their own based on their own morals and beliefs. Elder & Shanahan (2006) however, believe that people's responses to stimuli determines changes to the trajectory of life. Moreover, the involvement of the institution in the decision-making process also alters individual decisions and behaviors.  Axiom 4  Carstensen (2006) makes the inference that ones view on everyday situations and  success outcomes is more influential than their actual life status when it comes to their subsequent actions. Drawing from social comparison and symbolic interaction theories, a person's view of their resources may be different from what actually exists, and therefore shapes life trajectories in unique ways. People's view of their lives play a huge role into how they continue their trajectory through the decisions they make, and the activities they choose to partake in. Therefore, the theory makes the claim that those who possess a more positive and optimistic outlook on life typically are more satisfied with their life course.  Axiom 5  Ferraro, K.F., & Shippee, T.P. (2009) stated that before starting to explain Axiom 5, researchers should avoid cohort inversion. It will limit cohort centered studies, specifically, as it refers to the use of non random sample selection that excludes individuals with greater health issues from the samples. Studying individuals of certain age in this case, older adults, may lead to skewed data if selection of only healthier older adults takes place. The mean concentration of results will be designed to a specific population which will limit the data from being externally valid. The axiom may seem hard to understand at first but the overall meaning is that the accumulation of disadvantages can lead to premature mortality, or in simpler terms, younger death. Also, nonrandom selection may make it seem like mortality rates are decreasing when they are not. Take for example the number of young people deaths in areas with high crime and violence. These individuals are not exposed to many advancing opportunities so they fall victim of the cumulative inequality theory. The nonrandom selection component of the axiom signifies how older populations age in a manner that is not totally random, but rather as a result of the advantages and disadvantages that they have gathered throughout their life. An example is exceptional health care throughout life which prolonged lifespan, or, on the contrary, prolonged exposure to toxic chemicals as a result of working in dangerous environments.  Sources  Further reading  Social theories", "machine_text": " Cumulative inequality theory Cumulative inequality theory (CIT) is an explanation of the persistence of poverty and inequality in the world. It is based on the concept of \"cumulative causation,\" or the idea that the conditions of poverty and inequality can be self-perpetuating. According to CIT, poverty and inequality are not simply the result of individual factors, such as low incomes or lack of education. Rather, they are the result of a complex web of interrelated factors, such as the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a few individuals or groups, lack of access to resources and opportunities, and discrimination and marginalization based on race, gender, ethnicity, and other social and economic characteristics. In other words, CIT argues that poverty and inequality are not just about individual circumstances, but about the broader social and economic structures that shape those circumstances. For example, a person may be born into a poor family, but that person's poverty may be the result of generations of poverty and discrimination, rather than just the individual's personal circumstances. CIT also emphasizes the importance of understanding the ways in which poverty and inequality are interconnected. For example, poverty can contribute to inequality, as those who are poor may not have the same access to resources and opportunities as those who are not poor. Inequality, in turn, can perpetuate poverty, as those who are already poor may be most affected by policies and practices that increase inequality. Cumulative inequality theory is often used to explain the persistence of poverty and inequality in developing countries, where poverty and inequality are more widespread and severe. However, CIT can also be used to explain the persistence of poverty and inequality in developed countries, where poverty and inequality may be more concentrated and less severe, but still have a significant impact on people's lives. Cumulative inequality theory is often associated with the work of economist Robert E. Lucas, Jr., who used the concept of cumulative causation to explain the persistence of poverty in developing countries. Lucas argued that poverty can be self-perpetuating, as poor people may lack the resources and opportunities to break out of poverty, and their poverty can be passed from one generation to the next. Cumulative inequality theory has also been used to explain the persistence of inequality in developed countries, as well as the relationship between poverty and inequality. For example, some researchers have used CIT to explain why some groups, such as African Americans, have historically been more likely to be poor and to experience inequality, even in developed countries.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 42044690}

He then created the Romanian-Italian film production and distribution company \"Cineromit\". The first coproduction was \"Odessa in Flames\" (Odessa in fiamme) directed by Carmine Gallone on a screenplay by Gherardo Gherardi and Nicolae Kiri\u0163escu. The next production of \"Cineromit\" was scheduled to be produced in Romania. A second film, \"The white squadron\" (Squadriglia bianca), directed by Romanian director Ion Sava was released in 1944. The same year, Ion Cantacuzino, as producer, selected Jean Georgescu to direct the film \"A Winter Night's Dream\" (Visul unei nop\u0163i de iarn\u0103) based on a play by Tudor Mu\u0219atescu. Due to the war, the film could be completed only in 1945. Another project which Ion Cantacuzino was negotiating with the Italians was a historical drama on the life of Stephen the Great, based on a screenplay by Camil Petrescu, starring Amedeo Nazzari and Alida Valli. This project had to be abandoned due to the war.  Ion Cantacuzino was also planning to create, in cooperation with the Italians a center for the production of feature films in Romania. The plans for the construction of the center had been designed by architect Octav Doicescu and the Italian government had promised to provide the equipment. The project could not be finalized due to the war.  Activity after 1945  After the rise to power of the communist regime in Romania, Ion Cantacuzino was blacklisted, because of both his aristocratic background and his antisoviet attitude during the war years. He was arrested for a short time. After his release, he reverted to his second profession and worked for the rest of his life as a psychiatrist at the \"Br\u00e2ncovenesc Hospital\" in Bucharest.  However, he did not give up his activities related to the entertainment industry. He translatated various plays for theatrical performances such as Eduardo De Filippo's Filumena Marturano and George Bernard Shaw's Heartbreak House.  In the 1960s, without abandoning his profession as psychiatrist, Ion Cantacuzino was able to publish again. He finalized the volumes of memoirs which his mother, actress Maria Filotti had not been able to complete before her death. He also wrote a book on the history of Romanian cinema \"Moments from the past of Romanian film\" (1965).  Death  Ion Filotti Cantacuzino died on August 27, 1975. He is interred at Bellu Cemetery in Bucharest.  After his death a last film was produced based on one of his screenplays: \"The insane forest\" (P\u0103durea nebun\u0103), released in 1982, based on a novel by Zaharia Stancu.  In his memory, the \"Association of Film Critics\" has named \"Ion Cantacuzino Award\" its distinction for film journalism at the \"International Festival for Independent Film Anonimul\" organized each year in Sf\u00e2ntu Gheorghe.

They speak the Kokatha language, close to or a dialect of the Western Desert language.  Country Traditional Kokatha lands extend over some  according to the estimation of Norman Tindale, stretching over some of the harshest, waterless land on the Australian continent. They include Tarcoola, Kingoonyah, Pimba and the McDouall Peak as well as modern townships of Roxby Downs and Woomera. The lands extend west as far as Ooldea and the Ooldea Range while the northern frontier runs up to the Stuart Range and Lake Phillipson. Their boundary with Barngarla lands is marked by an ecological transition from their plateau to the lower hilly acacia scrubland and salt lake zones running south to the coast.  The tribes bordering on Kokatha lands were, running north clockwise, the Pitjantjara, the Yankuntjatjarra, the Antakirinja, the Arabana and Kuyani to their east, the Barngarla on the southeastern flank, the Wirangu directly south, the Mirning southwest, and the Ngalia to their west.  According to the Kokatha Aboriginal Corporation ():  History of contact The Kokatha were engaged in migration towards to southeast before the 1850s, when whites began to make their presence felt. Their hold on Ooldea area was relinquished around 1917 when they yielded before the pressure from the northern Yankuntjatjarra migrating there.  Native title  The Kokatha Aboriginal Corporation is the Registered Native Title Body Corporate (RNTBC) which covers areas determined to belong to the Kokatha people by the Native Title Act 1993, and represents the interests of the Kokatha people., there have been three native title determinations relating to the Kokatha in South Australia:  An Indigenous land use agreement (ILUA) was determined for the Gawler Ranges area, agreed on 13 June 2010.  A native title claim lodged by the Far West Coast Aboriginal Corporation RNTBC (representing a number of other peoples as well as the Kokatha nation) was determined on 5 December 2013, and covers land within the Pastoral Unincorporated Area as well as the District Council of Ceduna. This land lies along a wide strip extending inland from the coast, stretching from the border with Western Australia in the west across to a line roughly direct north of the western top edge of the Eyre Peninsula. It excludes a number of areas where native title has been extinguished. There is also an ILUA covering this area, agreed on 22 May 2014.  The second, determined on 1 September 2014, covers an area within the Roxby Council and some Pastoral Unincorporated Area.

Their traditional lands extend from the Great Australian Bight in the west to the lower reaches of the Murray River in the east, taking in much of the arid western portion of South Australia. The Kokatha population was 200 in 2016. The Kokatha language is closely related to that of the neighbouring Mirning people, with whom they share several customs, and the two are often grouped together as the Western Mirninggar. The Kokatha are also related to the Nukunu, with whom they share a common ancestor. According to Australian Aboriginal mythology, the creator being Tjurunga-ngara created the land from the body of an ancestral being, Tuna. The Kokatha homeland is the tail of Tuna, which is why the traditional lands of the Kokatha are called Mula-Tjuta, meaning \"the place of the big tail\". The sacred rock formation of Wilkawillina is the spleen of Tuna, and the site of many of the Kokatha's traditional ceremonies. The Kokatha are traditionally nomadic hunter-gatherers. They traversed their traditional lands, returning to sacred sites and family camps along the way. The Kokatha were skilled in land management, conservation, and the sustainable use of resources, and had a sophisticated knowledge of the environment. They made use of a wide range of food, including many plants, animals, and marine life. The Kokatha were also expert tool makers. They made stone tools from local resources, including quartz, quartzite, and ignimbrite. Tools included knives, spearheads, spear-throwers, clubs, pounds, and knives for processing marine life. They also made a range of other items, such as hair pins, necklaces, and message sticks. The Kokatha are an egalitarian society. Their traditional social organization is based on kinship, with each person belonging to one of eight main kinship groups. Children are born into the mother's kinship group, and marry outside the group. Kinship groups are matrilineal, and are linked through female ancestors. The Kokatha have a traditional code of behaviour, which includes an emphasis on equality, sharing, and cooperation. The Kokatha have a rich tradition of storytelling and oral history. They passed on their history through the stories of the ancestors, and the deeds of great heroes. The Kokatha also have a tradition of songlines, which are songs that describe the land and the movement of the ancestors across it.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 56063323}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Formyl peptide receptor\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The formyl peptide receptors (FPR) belong to a class of G protein-coupled receptors involved in chemotaxis.  In humans, there are three formyl peptide receptor isoforms, each encoded by a separate gene that are named FPR1, FPR2, and FPR3. These receptors were originally identified by their ability to bind N-formyl peptides such as N-formylmethionine produced by the degradation of either bacterial or host cells.  Hence formyl peptide receptors are involved in mediating immune cell response to infection.  These receptors may also act to suppress the immune system under certain conditions. The close phylogenetic relation of signaling in chemotaxis and olfaction was recently proved by detection formyl peptide receptor like proteins as a distinct family of vomeronasal organ chemosensors in mice.  FPR is now properly accepted as termed FPR1 by the International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology.  Discovery   Studies conducted in the 1970s found that a series of N-Formylmethionine-containing oligopeptides, including the most potent and best known member of this series, N-formylmethionine-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLF or fMet-Leu-Phe), stimulated rabbit and human neutrophils by an apparent receptor-dependent mechanism to migrate in a directional pattern in classical laboratory assays of chemotaxis. Since these oligopeptides were produced by bacteria or synthetic analogs of such products, it was suggested that the N-formyl oligopeptides are important chemotatic factors and their receptors are important chemotactic factor receptors that act respectively as signaling and signal-recognizing elements to initiate inflammation responses in order to defend against bacterial invasion.  Further studies defined a receptor for the N-formyl oligopeptides, formyl peptide receptor (FPR), so named based on its ability to bind and become activated by the oligopeptides.  Two receptors where thereafter discovered and named FPR1 and FPR2 based on the similarity of their genes' predicted amino acid sequence to that of FPR rather than on any ability to bind or be activated by the formyl oligopeptides. These three receptors have been renamed as FPR1, FPR2, and FPR3 and found to have very different specificities for the formyl oligopeptides and very different functions that include initiating inflammatory  responses to N-formyl peptides released not only by bacteria but also a multiplicity of elements released by host tissues; dampening and resolving inflammatory responses; and perhaps contributing to the development of certain neurological cancers and an array of neurological diseases Amyloid-based diseases.  Structure and function   The formyl peptide receptor (FPR) belongs to the class of receptors possessing seven hydrophobic transmembrane domains. The conformation of the FPR is stabilized by several interactions. These include potential salt bridge formation between Arg84-Arg205, Lys85-Arg205, and Lys85-Asp284 which help determine the three-dimensional structure of transmembrane domains, as well as positively charged residues (Arg, Lys) which interact with negatively charged phosphates.  Furthermore, residue Arg163 may interact with the ligand binding pocket of the second extracellular loop of the FPR.  With respect to binding of the formyl Met-Leu-Phe peptide, there are additional potential interactions which include hydrogen bonding interactions between Arg84 and Lys85 of the first extracellular loop and the N-formyl group of the ligand as well as the peptide backbone of formyl Met-Leu-Phe which can form similar interactions. The formyl-Met moiety of the ligand was shown to form disulfide bridges with Cys residues, and an interaction with Arg163 was also demonstrated. (It is important to mention that some interaction which stabilize the conformation of the receptor may also influence ligand-binding.) Some oligopeptides were also described as characteristic constituents linked to Asn-s of the extracellular N terminal part and to the ligand binding pocket of the second extracellular loop. These components can also determine or make more specific the ligand-receptor interaction.  Signaling pathways  Induction of FPR triggers multiple changes in eukaryotic cells including rearrangement of the cytoskeleton which in turn facilitates cell migration and the synthesis of chemokines.  Important FPR regulated pathways include:  G protein dependent activation of phospholipase C (PLC) which results in the breakdown of the membrane constituent phospholipid, phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2) into inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacyl glycerol (DAG). IP3 is one of the most effective inducers of Ca2+ increase from cytoplasmic pools and from outside the cell via opening Ca2+ channels. DAG in turn is an inducer of protein kinase C (PKC).  Activation of the regulatory small GTPase, RAS.  The active RAS can in turn activate RAF, a Ser/Thr kinase. In the next step mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAP kinases) are activated. (Also known as extracellular signal-regulated kinases - ERKs or MAP/ERK kinase (MEK)). As a result of the last step, ERK1 and ERK2 are activated. The phosphorylated forms of ERKs can continue the cascade by triggering activation more interacting kinases which results in altered transcriptional activity in the nucleus.  Ligand binding to FPR can also induce the activation of CD38, an ectoenzyme of the surface membrane.  As a result of activation NAD+ molecules will enter the cytoplasm. NAD+ is converted into cyclic ADP ribose (cADPR), a second messenger which interacts with ryanodine receptors (RyR) on the surface of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The overall result of the process is increased cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels via the direct pathway described above and also via indirect pathways such as opening of Ca2+ channels in the cell membrane. The sustained increase of Ca2+ is required for directed migration of the cells.

Considered the patriarch of Basque music, his music has had an influence on younger generations. A testament to this is the tribute album Txerokee, Mikel Laboaren Kantak (\"Cherokee: Songs of Mikel Laboa\"), published in 1991 by various younger-generation rock and folk music groups. His album Bat-Hiru (\"One-Three\") was chosen in a reader poll by the local Diario Vasco newspaper as the greatest Basque album in history. Nearly all of his songs are sung in Basque.  Biography Mikel Laboa was born 15 June 1934 in Pasaia, Gipuzkoa.  He spent nearly two years of his childhood in the town of Lekeitio, Bizkaia. In the 1950s he studied medicine and psychiatry in Pamplona-Iru\u00f1a. He would constantly balance his artistic career with his medical career, which began at the Children's Neuropsychiatry unit at Patronato San Miguel in San Sebasti\u00e1n, where he worked for almost 20 years.  During his student years he became interested in music, influenced by artists such as Atahualpa Yupanqui and Violeta Parra. Following in their footsteps, Laboa would likewise identify himself as a \"political artist.\" In 1958 he made his debut at the Teatro Gayarre in Pamplona.  During the 1960s he, along with other Basque artists including singer Lourdes Iriondo, Xabier Lete and Benito Lertxundi, founded the cultural group Ez Dok Amairu (\"There is no 13\"), which in many ways sought to revitalize Basque culture, long dormant under the Francoist regime. They dedicated their focus on the revival and social status of the Basque language. Within this group Laboa came into his own, emerging along with Benito Lertxundi as a prime example of what was called \"new Basque music.\"  Laboa's music can be described as a combination of tradition, poetry and experimentalism, in the songwriting style of the 1960s and 1970s, but endowed with a strong personal touch and a unique voice. His work combines old standards reinterpreted in modern style, lyrical poetry from authors such as Bertolt Brecht, and suitable compositions. Deserving special mention are his Lekeitioak, experimental songs based on shouts and onomatopoetic sounds.  Laboa was a creative force for 35 years, continuing well into his old age until his fragile health kept him away from the stage. He would collaborate often with jazz musician I\u00f1aki Salvador and worked with the Orfe\u00f3n Donostiarra and other orchestral groups from the Basque Country. Some of his most well-known songs are featured in La pelota vasca (\"The Basque ball\"), a documentary by Julio Medem. On 11 July 2006 he gave his final performance, opening for Bob Dylan at a \"Concert for Peace\" held in the city of Donostia-San Sebasti\u00e1n.  A curious feature of his album titles is the fact that they are numeric. This custom began in 1974 with the release of his two-disc Bat-Hiru (1\u20133). The album 2, with songs based on the writings of Brecht, had been banned by Francoist censorship. This was followed by the double LP Lau-Bost (4\u20135) and 6. His Lekeitios comprised albums 7 through 11, although only a compilation of these was released through low-key marketing. These were followed by 12, and Laboa skipped number 13 in homage to the group Ez Dok Amairu, whose name means \"There's no 13\" in Basque. Afterwards, he released 14, and his live albums 15 and 16. Not including compilations, his most recent release was 17 (Xoriek).   His final collaboration was with the Pasaia group Naizroxa, where he contributed to the first and only song on the first disc, \"Iqharaturic.\"  Mikel Laboa died 1 December 2008 at a hospital in Donostia-San Sebasti\u00e1n at the age of 74.

Mikel Laboa was born in Ondarroa, Biscay, in 1967. His father, from Ondarroa, was a docker, and his mother, from Madrid, was a cleaner. They divorced when he was two years old, and his mother moved to Madrid with his older sister, while he and his younger brother stayed with their father. When he was six years old, he started playing the violin, but he soon abandoned it. Then, at the age of eight, he began to play the txalaparta, a traditional Basque percussion instrument. He was attracted to rock music, and at the age of 12, he started playing the electric guitar. He soon became the leader of a group of friends who played covers of songs by groups like the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, and the Who. When he was 14 years old, he started his first serious band, called Zingirikizuna (which means \"We will not give in\" in Basque). After three years of playing covers, they started to write their own songs in Basque. They soon had their first hits, which were played on the radio and at parties. When he was 18 years old, he left the band and started another one, called Guria. After two years, he went solo. He released his first album, Mikel Laboa, in 1991. In 1993, he released his second album, Irrintzi, which included the hit \"Aupa Euskadi!\" (\"Hail Euskadi!\"). In 1995, he released his third album, 35/3, which included the hit \"Pari Pari Handia\" (\"Go Forward\").

The USFSP baseball team won and earned well deserved bragging rights and huge momentum the team carried throughout the rest of the season. The team finished its inaugural opening season with an 18\u20135 season and played against larger, well established teams like the University of Florida and Florida State University. The team also traveled to Miami to play the University of Miami. However, because the team is considered only a club and is not a registered, official team, the USFSP Baseball Club was ineligible to play or qualify for any championships or playoffs. \t However, the team does have long-term plans of becoming an NCAA team. In the meantime, the officers and players are focusing on recruiting more talented players. This way, the team can gain more acknowledgment and support from faculty and students. They also want to establish a name for themselves amongst other colleges. The team also hopes that more fans will come out to support the baseball team during their games next season, even if they do not like baseball. Players have said that simply coming to the game to support student athletes, friends, and classmates is encouraging. \t Despite being barred from championships at the present time, the team did have some special acknowledgments and awards to accompany its amazing first season including an acknowledgment from USF President Dr. Judy Genshaft and was the  2013-14 New Organization of the Year. Berger was also nominated for student leader of the year. \t The season began on February 15, 2014, with USF St. Petersburg playing against USF Tampa. The competition was dubbed \u201cThe Battle of the Bay\u201d and was inspired by the already existent inter-campus rivalries. Dozens of students from both campuses arrived to cheer on their teams. Although the Tampa team, which was also playing its inaugural game, lost the 9-inning contest, both teams hope to make the inter-campus games an annual tradition.  For its first season, the team made Al Lang Stadium and Walter Fuller Baseball Stadium its home stadiums. The Al Lang Stadium, a couple blocks away from the school campus and in the heart of downtown St. Petersburg, Florida, hosts dozens of sporting events for several different teams and sports. During soccer season, the stadium is transformed into a soccer field and hosts The Rowdies, the St. Petersburg professional soccer team. When the season is over, however, the field is transformed into a baseball field and allows for amateur baseball teams to play. The Walter Fuller Baseball Stadium was the former spring training field for the Tampa Bay Rays. However, when the Rays moved spring training to the Charlotte Sports Park, the Walter Fuller Baseball Stadium started hosting high school baseball teams and baseball tournaments.  \t On June 5, 2014, the St. Petersburg City Council held a meeting to determine if future contracts with the USFSP team will be made. The council decided in favor for these future contracts to be written. Now, the team has a place to play for at least one more season. \t USF St. Petersburg has yet to build a stadium for any of the school's organized sports to be played on teams. The small campus does have a gym with dozens of work out machines, a pool, a couple basketball courts, and a waterfront program that gives sailing, scuba diving, and paddle boarding lessons just to name a few of its services.  \t The only team that the USFSP campus houses is the sailing team. This team keeps all of its equipment in the school's harbor and waterfront storage house. Because the school borders against the water, the sailing team practices and races in the ocean behind the campus. Also, because of the nature of this water sport, no benches or bleachers have been made to observe the races from land.  \t All the other USF teams are based out of the USF Tampa campus. However, even in Tampa, the teams often have to go to a different, already established stadium for professional teams in order to play. Even the USF football team has to travel to Raymond James Stadium (the home of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers) to play opponents in games. \t Despite the USFSP baseball team having an impressive first season and bring more sports to the St. Petersburg campus, it is not the first time a baseball team has represented the small, coastal campus. For several years during the 1970s, not a full decade after the campus was founded, students had built a  team as well. Like today, the team was categorized as a club rather than an actual, registered team - likely due to the fact that it is a club, not a registered team. Players brought their own gloves, bats, and other equipment in order to play since the school did not provide any. Despite this, the team still played larger universities and had impressive season records, much like today's team. Because the USFSP would rarely win against these other registered teams, it often confused the other team about what to do with their records. Other universities did not know if these games should count as wins since the USFSP team was not registered. It was common for these teams to decide not to include the USFSP games in their records. They simply considered the games to be practice or warm ups for the rest of the season.

He governed from October 17, 1585 to January 26, 1590.  Early life and appointment as viceroy  Born in Spain in the decade of the 1540s, Manrique de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga was a younger son of the fourth Duke of B\u00e9jar, Francisco de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga y Sotomayor. He served the Spanish Crown with such efficiency and loyalty that King Philip II rewarded him in 1575 with the title of Marqu\u00e9s de Villamanrique.  On February 26, 1585 Philip named him viceroy of New Spain to succeed Pedro Moya de Contreras. At this time Manrique de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga had lived for several years in Seville, where he had gained indirect experience with the Indies. In his case, the king made the choice personally, rather than relying on the recommendation of the Council of the Indies, as was the case ordinarily. He remained in Spain for a few months before leaving for the New World. He arrived in San Juan de Ul\u00faa (Veracruz) on September 7, 1585, with his wife. Shortly thereafter he made his formal entry into Mexico City to take up his office.  Administration  Manrique de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga began his administration by completing the regulations introduced by the previous viceroy governing the sale of wine in the colony, and the location of taverns.  In 1586 the conflict between the regular clergy and secular clergy involving questions of prerogatives and jurisdiction erupted again. This was a continuation of the conflict between those parties during the administration of Viceroy Mart\u00edn Enr\u00edquez de Almanza. The friars (regular clergy) had the support of the people, but the regulars were supported by the viceroy and by the nobles. Clergy of the Dominican, Augustinian and Franciscan orders were bitter opponents of this viceroy.  Depredations by pirates continued. On October 18, 1586, Sir Francis Drake took the Manila galleon Santa Ana. On August 6, 1587, the port of Huatulco (Oaxaca) fell to English corsair Thomas Cavendish, and on September 3, 1587 he sacked Navidad (Jalisco). Cavendish also captured the Manila galleon Santa Ana off Baja California on November 15, 1587. Each Manila galleon was loaded with a year's worth of treasure from the Philippines en route to Acapulco for ultimate delivery to Spain.  Manrique de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga's response included the establishment of a militia of volunteers to defend Pacific ports and the arming of Spanish ships to fight the pirates at sea.  Manrique took important steps toward ending the long-running Chichimeca War on New Spain's northern frontiers which threatened communications with silver mines near the city of Zacatecas.  The Spanish policy of defeating and enslaving the Chichimecas had been unsuccessful.  Manrique, following the advice of Churchmen, implemented a new approach to the war.  He removed many Spanish soldiers from the frontier as they were considered more a provocation than a remedy. He opened negotiations with Chichimeca leaders and promised them food, clothing, land, priests, and tools to encourage them through \u201cgentle persuasion\u201d to settle down. He forbade military operations to seek out and capture and kill hostile Indians. The results were favorable.  By 1590, he declared the roads to Zacatecas safe (for the first time in 40 years) and the war slowly wound down.  His fall  In 1588 the viceroy was involved in a jurisdictional dispute with the Audiencia de Guadalajara. This newly founded Audiencia had been functioning independently of the Audiencia of Mexico City, and virtually independently of the viceroy. Manrique's attempts to asserts his authority were viewed as arbitrary, and were met with considerable hostility. Allegations against him of tyranny, cupidity, nepotism, censorship of letters from New Spain to Spain, and other abuses  were made against him with the Council of the Indies. The majority of the charges were false or exaggerated, but the colony seemed to be on the verge of civil war.  The bishop of Puebla, Pedro Romanos, was named visitador (royal inspector) to deal with the crisis. Romanos was an enemy of Manrique, because of their opposite sides in the earlier secular-regular conflict. He worked passionately to oppose the viceroy, and seized his property. This seizure was subsequently lifted by the Council of the Indies, but that ruling was ignored in New Spain, and the viceroy was consigned to poverty.  Manrique continued as viceroy until January, 1590, when his successor, Luis de Velasco, marqu\u00e9s de Salinas arrived in Mexico City to take over the administration. Manrique was forced to remain a few more years in New Spain, as the subject of a lawsuit. He was still destitute, and also ill. He was finally able to return to Spain and seek restitution, but he died shortly after reaching Madrid, impoverished and bitter.

Visibility is primarily determined by weather conditions (see visibility) and by a vehicle's design. The parts of a vehicle that influence visibility include the windshield, the dashboard and the pillars. Good driver visibility is essential to safe road traffic.  Conditions for blind spots Blind spots exist in a wide range of vehicles: aircraft, cars, buses, trucks, agricultural equipments, heavy equipments, motorboats, sailboats, trams, and trains. Blind spots may occur in the front of the driver when the A-pillar (also called the windshield pillar), side-view mirror, or interior rear-view mirror block a driver's view of the road. Behind the driver, cargo, headrests, and additional pillars may reduce visibility. Proper adjustment of mirrors and the use of other technical solutions can eliminate or alleviate vehicle blind spots.  A no zone is one of several areas around a large truck, where the truck driver cannot see. Collisions frequently occur in no zones.  Adjusting mirrors to end side blind spots If the side view mirrors of a car are adjusted in a particular way, there is no blind spot on the sides. The method is frequently overlooked in driver's education classes and takes some getting used to. Calculated elimination of blind spots by properly trained drivers is inexpensive and obviates the need for costly technological solutions to that problem, provided drivers take the time to set up and use their mirrors effectively. The arrangementpointing the side-view mirrors substantially outboard in a fixed mechanical formulais relatively simple to achieve, but it takes some knowledgeable effort and getting used to. It is reputed to be a lifesaver.  However, one source considers that method a driving mistake and claims it is even more dangerous than not using it, because it creates other blind spots directly behind the vehiclenine reasons are listed, e.g., when backing upwhich are impossible to eliminate by a \"shoulder check\".  Rearward invisibility is an entirely different matter. The area directly behind vehicles is the source of back-up collisions, particularly involving pedestrians, children, and objects directly aft of a vehicle. That area has been called a \"killing zone\". These problems are the object of a number of technological solutions, including (in rough order of technological complexity, simplest first): rear-view mirror, side-view mirror, fresnel lens, sonar, parking sensors, and backup camera. A similar problem attaches to positions left and right of a vehicles' rear bumper as the driver attempts to back out of a parking space. Specially designed cross traffic alert warning systems have been developed to address these.  Motor vehicles   As one is driving an automobile, blind spots are the areas of the road that cannot be seen while looking forward or through either the rear-view or side mirrors (expecting that the side mirrors are properly adjusted on a passenger auto  see above). The most common are the rear quarter blind spots, areas towards the rear of the vehicle on both sides. Vehicles in the adjacent lanes of the road that fall into these blind spots may not be visible using only the car's mirrors. Rear quarter blind spots can be:  checked by turning one's head briefly (risking rear-end collisions),  reduced by installing mirrors with larger fields-of-view, or  eliminated by reducing overlap between side and rear-view mirrors by adjusting side mirrors so the side of the car is barely visible when your head is between the front seats (for the right side mirror) and almost touching the drivers window (for the left side mirror), then checking to be sure you can see cars approaching from behind on either side when on the highway.  Other areas that are sometimes called blind spots are those that are too low to see behind, in front, or to the sides of a vehicle, especially those with a high seating point.  Forward visibility  This diagram shows the blocked view in a horizontal-plane in front of the driver. The front-end blind spots caused by this can create problems in traffic situations, such as in roundabouts, intersections, and road crossings. Front-end blind spots are influenced by the following design criteria:  Distance between the driver and the pillar Thickness of the pillar The angle of the pillar in a vertical plane side view The angle of the pillar in a vertical plane front view the form of the pillar straight or arc-form Angle of the windshield Height of the driver in relation to the dashboard Speed of the opposite car  Types of A-pillar design Most passenger cars have a diagonal pillar in the side view. The angle between the horizon and A-pillar is approximately 40 degrees with a straight pillar that is not too thick. This gives the car a strong, aerodynamic body with an adequately sized front door.  Panoramic vertical A-pillars The sides of a panoramic windshield are curved, which makes it possible to design vertical A-pillars that give the driver maximum forward visibility. However, it is impossible to design an aerodynamic small car with a vertical A-pillar because the more vertical the A-pillar is, the less space the door opening has, and the greater frontal area and coefficient of drag the vehicle will have.  Examples of cars with an almost vertical A-pillar: Honda Step Bus Concept Saab 900 School bus Almost all Cadillacs from 1954 to 1959  Flat A-pillar design  Some modern car designs have an extremely flat A-pillar angle with the horizon. For example, the Pontiac Firebird and Chevrolet Camaro from 1993 to 2002 had a windshield angle of 68\u00b0 with the vertical, which equals just 22\u00b0 with the horizon.  A flatter A-pillar's advantages include reducing the overall drag coefficient and making the car body stronger in a frontal collision, at the expense of reducing driver visibility in a 180\u00b0 field of view from left to right. A flatter A-pillar (and therefore windscreen) is also a factor when calculating the effects of a collision with a pedestrian. In general, a flatter angle will result in a more gentle impact, directing the pedestrian \"up and over\" rather than directly into the windscreen. This is particularly true for cars like the Mercedes-Benz A-Class which also have a low angled engine cover.  Other disadvantages of a flat windshield angle  Other traffic can not see the driver through the reflection if the driver can see them. The heater needs more time to heat the bigger window surface. The flat windshield angle does not let snow slide off easily. The driver cannot reach the whole flat window to clean it easily.  Height of the driver Driver height can also affect visibility.  An A-pillar that is split up and has a small triangle window (Front Quarter glass) can give a short driver visibility problems. Some cars the windshield is fillet with the roof-line with a big radius. A fillet round A-pillar can give a tall driver visibility problems. Also sometimes the A-pillar can block the driver from seeing motorcyclists.  Also the B-pillar can block the vision of a tall driver in small 4 door cars.  A driver may reduce the size of a blind spot or eliminate it completely by turning their head in the direction of the obstruction. This allows the driver to see better around the obstruction and allows the driver better depth perception.  Visibility in a convertible Because there is no roof connection between the A- and B-pillars, the A-pillars of a convertible automobile have to be stronger and even thicker.  However, with the top down there are no B or C pillars, improving visibility behind the driver.  Windshield reflections  Dashboard reflection It is best if the dashboard has a non-reflecting dark-colored surface.  A small dashboard gives some reflection on the lower part of the windshield.  A big dashboard can give reflection on eye height.  A-pillar reflection It is best if the inside of the A-pillar has a non-reflecting dark colored surface.  If the side of the window is curved there is less A-pillar reflection.  Light through roof reflection Some new model cars have a very big sunroof. Sometimes the sunlight through the roof lights up the dashboard and gives a reflection in the windshield.  Other automobile design factors Other design factors may prevent a manufacturer from maximizing visibility. These include safety, as narrower pillars cannot be made strong as easily as thicker pillars, and size restraints pertaining to aerodynamics, as taller, more vertical windshields create additional drag and reduce fuel efficiency. They also include fashion and cost, whereby design and appearance considerations can be deemed preeminent.  Side radar systems offer better performance and also warn of fast-approaching vehicles entering the blind spot.  Trams and trains  Blind spots also exist around trams (streetcars/trolleys) and trains (locomotives with freight cars (goods wagons) and/or passenger cars (carriages/coaches) and multiple units).  Agricultural equipments Blind spots also exist around agricultural equipments (utility tractors, combine harvesters, etc.).  Heavy equipments Blind spots also exist around heavy equipments (excavators, bulldozers, wheel loaders, cranes, etc.).  Boats   Blind spots also exist in front of boats. When the boat accelerates, the bow rises, increasing the size of the blind spot. Large vessels can have up to several hundreds of meters of blind spot. This is generally known as the dead visual range of a ship. To address this, cameras are sometimes placed in the front of the vessel to cover the missing field of view.  Blind spots exist where areas behind the sail are obscured from the view of a helmsman on a sailboat or windsurfer. This is especially true when they are heeled over; consequently, transparent windows are sometimes sewn into the sails.  Aircraft Blind spots also exist around aircraft (helicopters, airships, passenger aircraft, cargo aircraft, etc.).

These are most commonly associated with automobiles, but they also exist for other vehicles, such as bicycles, motorcycles, and trucks. Blind spots can be caused by the shape of the vehicle's body, the size and position of the driver's seat, and the design of the road on which the vehicle is traveling. Blind spots can be a major safety hazard, as they can prevent a driver from seeing vehicles or other objects that are in close proximity to the driver's own vehicle. This can lead to accidents, such as when a driver attempts to change lanes or make a turn without realizing that there is another vehicle in the blind spot. To reduce the risk of accidents caused by blind spots, drivers are encouraged to use extra caution when driving in areas with potential blind spots, and to use mirrors and other visual aids to help them see better. Blind spots can also be a problem for pedestrians and cyclists, as they can make it difficult for these individuals to see oncoming vehicles. To reduce the risk of accidents involving pedestrians and cyclists, drivers are encouraged to be extra cautious when driving in areas with high pedestrian or cyclist traffic, and to be aware of any potential blind spots that may exist.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 545001}

It is the nation's fifth oldest light station and the seventh oldest U.S. lighthouse. It is both the oldest and the tallest lighthouse in Connecticut and on Long Island Sound, with its tower reaching 90 feet.  The light is visible for 15 miles and consists of three seconds of white light every six seconds. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. It is currently owned and maintained by the New London Maritime Society as part of the National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act program.  Location New London Harbor Light is located at Lighthouse Point in southern New London, just east of Guthrie Beach off Pequot Avenue.  In addition to the lighthouse, the station includes the keeper's house, a two-and-a-half-story brick residence.  The property once also included a barn, an oil house, and an engine room; all of these structures have been removed.  History  The original New London Harbor Lighthouse was built on the west side of the entrance to New London Harbor in 1760. Connecticut ceded the lighthouse to the United States according to the \"Memoranda of Cessions\" of 7 August 1789.  On May 7, 1800, Congress appropriated funds to rebuild the lighthouse, and it was removed in 1801 when the current stone tower was built. In 1855, a fourth-order Fresnel lens replaced the original 11 lamps with  reflectors.  Illumination was converted to oil-vapor lamp in 1909 and to acetylene in 1912.  The light was electrified in 1930.  The present keeper's house was built in 1863, and was enlarged in 1900 to accommodate the families of married keepers.

It is located on the former site of Fort Trumbull, which was an integral part of the harbor's defenses during the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812. In Nigerians, Fort Trumbull was the site of a battle in which the British captured the fort from the French in 1781 during the American Revolutionary War. The British remained in control of the fort until the end of the war in 1783, when they evacuated and destroyed much of the fort's infrastructure. The United States government reconstructed Fort Trumbull in the early 1800s, and it was equipped with twenty-six 24-pounders and two 13-inch mortars. During the War of 1812, the fort was the site of a battle between British forces, assisted by a contingent of loyalists, and American militia led by Connecticut Governor Roger Griswold. On September 6, 1814, the British attacked the fort and burned the surrounding village of Groton. They were repulsed with significant losses by the fort's garrison, which was assisted by the crew of the USS Flicker. The British retreated to their ships and shelled the fort for the next three days. The fort's 150-man garrison held out, despite suffering twenty-one casualties, until the British abandoned the field on September 9. The New London Harbor Light was one of the earliest lighthouses in the United States. It was lit in 1760, and is therefore known as the third oldest lighthouse in the country. The New London Harbor Light was also the first lighthouse in the country to be built on a fort. The New London Harbor Light is a Visitors' Center for the New London Maritime Museum. The Museum offers tours of the Light and Fort Trumbull. Connecticut's state seal features a shield with a blue background, on which a tall ship, a symbol of the state's maritime history, is depicted. The state motto, \"Qui Transtulit Sustinet,\" is displayed on a ribbon surrounding the shield, and translates to \"He Who Transplanted Still Sustains.\" The seal was adopted in 1775, shortly after the colony's inception.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 7123996}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Copenhagen Fire of 1795\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Copenhagen Fire of 1795 (K\u00f8benhavns brandes 1795) started on Friday, 5 June 1795, at or around 3 pm by the Navy's old base south east of Kongens Nytorv on Gammelholm, in the Navy's magazine for coal and timber, the so-called Dellehave. As the workers had already gone home, a considerable length of time passed before efforts to combat the fire started, and out of fear for theft, the fire hydrants had been removed. The people of Holmen also blocked the civilian fire brigade, possibly in the belief that since it was a military area, the military should take care of it.  There had been an extended period without rain and the dry wood, combined with the storage of rope work and tar, made the fire spread quickly. The wind blew especially strong from east-southeast, and that meant the countless embers were carried through the air into the city. Because of the strong sunlight, small fires were difficult to detect until they have taken hold. This is why the fire spread from Gammelholm to the main magazine along Holmens Canal (Holmens Kanal Danish) and over Holmens Canal to the quarter around Saint Nicolai Church and from there, along Gammel Strand to the area around Nytorv/Gammeltorv.  The fire at Nicolai Church  Right by Saint Nicolai Church, after the Copenhagen Fire of 1728, infrastructure to fight fires had been constructed because the area was very densely built up. A basin that could hold 400 barrels of water had been excavated for use. In addition, a pumping station was built that could pump water through an 800-foot-long hose. The pumps were able to raise the pressure to such a level that it could deliver one barrel of water per minute from the hose. But when a spark set fire to the church tower, nobody could find the key to the door of the pumping station. Only some time later did anyone think of kicking the door in. By then, the fire had already taken hold and the residents in the surrounding quarter were panicked. The road became so full of people, who were also transporting furniture to safety from the fire, that the water hoses could not be brought close to the fire. Soon the church burned to the ground, and with it the pumps. At that point, the Saint Nicolai quarter could not be saved.  Fighting the fire  The majority of the residents in the area threatened by the fire chose to flee, but in some places residents chose to stay in their houses and fight the fire. This happened in the first three to four houses on the north side of \u00d8stergade. Here people spread themselves throughout the houses both inside and out, armed with buckets and plenty of water. This prevented the fire from taking hold and saved the neighbouring street of K\u00f8bmagergade at the same time, since it would have inevitably have spread to there as well.  The Conference Advisory, Carsten Anker, had his mansion on the corner of Ving\u00e5rdsstr\u00e6de and Kongens Nytorv saved by covering both it and a connected building with a sail that constantly had water poured on it.  The Justice Advisory, Peter Uldall, saved his mansion in Vimmelskaftet by paying a large party to stay and put out any embers. It also prevented the fire from spreading to the northern side of the plaza, so only the southern side burned down.  Consequences  The fire died out on Sunday, 7 July, around 4 pm. It had destroyed 909 houses and partially damaged 74. Just over 6,000 of the just under 100,000 residents in the capital were made homeless. A large number of them took refuge in the ruins of the recently burned-down Christianborgs Castle, the remaining walls of which were so large that an entire family could move into a window niche. The stables were also used as housing.  The fire had, together with Copenhagen's fire of 1728, in effect burned down almost the whole of Copenhagen's medieval and Renaissance heritage and so only a few houses from before the 18th century remain in that part of the city. More historic buildings in Copenhagen would be lost to fire in 1807 when the city was bombarded by the British.  The fire was a strong contributing factor to the foundation of Denmark's first credit institution, Kreditkassen for Husejerne i Kj\u00f8benhavn, in 1797.  After the fire, a large-scale plan was designed by the city planner J\u00f8rgen Henrich Rawert and the construction master Peter Meyn. The plan dictated the newly constructed houses should be made of masonry (instead of being timber framed) and house corners at intersections should be diagonal and the streets straightened so that the fire department's long ladder companies could navigate the streets more easily.

In the fire, over two-thirds of the medieval buildings in the city were destroyed. The fire was finally stopped at 7 am on 1 August after it had destroyed the homes of 5,000 people and damaged those of a further 1,500. The fire began at the northern end of the city, in the area now known as the Str\u00f8get, at around midnight on 31 July. Strong winds fanned the flames, and the fire raged for nine hours before it began to abate. The fire left the city in a state of emergency, with over 30,000 people left homeless. The immediate death toll was limited to two, but the fire is believed to have claimed more lives later as a result of people being burned to death in their homes or from smoke inhalation. The fire was the greatest catastrophe to befall Copenhagen since the Copenhagen Fire of 1728, which had also destroyed a large part of the medieval city. The old city was rebuilt over the next several years, and the destruction of the medieval buildings gave the city a new, uniform look with large, rectangular blocks.

He was born Scott Thomas Burns in Brooklyn New York, on Halloween, October 31, 1962.  Immediately after his birth, he was moved to the Angel Guardian Home in Brooklyn, New York, where he was put up for adoption. A few months later he was adopted by Frances Ann McCambridge and Gerard Alexander McCambridge Sr.. After the adoption was final, they changed his name to Gerard Alexander McCambridge Jr..  From the age of 9 years old, Gerard was fascinated by magic.  He started to study the art as a hobby. Gerard performed his first magic show at a neighbors birthday party for money at the age of 12. He was billing himself as \"Gerard the Great.\" He started apprenticing for professional magicians and touring the country as an on stage assistant at the age of 15. By the time he was 18, he had a full show of his own. It is then he changed his performing name to Gerry McCambridge. Years later he took his love for magic, and mixed it with the observational skills he learned from his father who was a NYC detective and an expert at interrogation, and added a few mentalism routines to his magic show. In 1988 he stopped performing magic completely and focused solely on performing as a mentalist.  He has studied memory techniques, body language interpretation, stage hypnosis, linguistics, statistics, law of averages, non-verbal communication, acting, theatre and stand up comedy, to enhance his mentalism show. In the 1980s Gerry was headlining as \u201cGerry McCambridge-The Mentalist\u201d in Comedy Clubs across the country.    Gerry also appeared on countless radio and TV talk shows. In 2002 Gerry dropped his name and billed himself as \u201cThe Mentalist.\u201d  In 1999, the International Magicians Society presented Gerry with the \u201cMerlin Award\u201d for \u201cMentalist of the Decade\u201d.  Gerry was the first mentalist in history to receive the Merlin award for mentalism since the organizations inception in 1968.  In 2002 Gerry wrote his first TV script titled \u201cThe Mentalist\u201d and took it out to Los Angeles to pitch it to the major networks.  Jeff Zucker, the president of NBC witnessed Gerry\u2019s live performances many times, and instantly licensed the special for his network.  Gerry became the creator, executive producer and star of the hit prime-time network television special \"The Mentalist\u201d which started airing to 6.2 million viewers in the United States on May 12, 2004. The show then aired in Canada, South Africa, Korea, The Middle East, New Zealand, India, Thailand, Australia, Denmark, The Netherlands, Malaysia and the United Kingdom.  In 2004 the Psychic Entertainers Association, an international organization of his peers, awarded Gerry for his \u201cOutstanding Contributions to the Art of Mentalism.\u201d  Also in the summer of 2004 Gerry performed his one man show \u201cThe Mentalist\u201d to critical acclaim Off-Broadway in New York City and made his acting debut in the movie \"Mattie Fresno and the Holofulx Universe.\"  In 2005 the Psychic Entertainers Association again awarded Gerry. This time he received the \u201cMentalist of the Year\u201d award.  Gerry performed for a year of sold out performances at the Rampart Casino. From there, Gerry moved his show to the Legendary Stardust Casino. When the Stardust closed its doors for implosion, Gerry moved his show to Hooters Hotel and Casino.  Starting in October 2007 he appeared on a weekly television show titled Phenomenon with Criss Angel, Holly Madison  and Uri Geller.  In August 2008, the International Magicians Society presented Gerry with the \u201cMerlin Award\u201d for \u201cMentalist of the Year.\u201d   In 2009 he was voted one of the \"Top 10 Absolutely Have To See\" shows in Las Vegas by the Las Vegas Weekly Magazine.  In 2010 the Las Vegas Review Journal readers poll placed Gerry's show as the \"Best Bargain Show in all of Las Vegas.\"  On April 5, 2020, Gerry McCambridge celebrated his 4,000th Las Vegas performance having been in that city for fifteen years. This makes McCambridge the longest running and most financially successful mentalist show in Las Vegas history.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"History of Rockland County, New York (1798\u20131900)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The recorded history of Rockland County, New York begins on February 23, 1798, when the county was split off from Orange County, New York and formed as its own administrative division of the state of New York. It is located  north-northwest of New York City, and is part of the New York Metropolitan Area.  The county seat is the hamlet of New City. The name comes from rocky land, an early description of the area given by settlers. Rockland is New York's southernmost county west of the Hudson River.  It is suburban in nature, with a considerable amount of scenic designated parkland. Rockland County does not border any of the New York City boroughs, but is only  north of Manhattan at the counties' (New York and Rockland) two respective closest points (Palisades, New York, in Rockland and Inwood Park in Manhattan)  Most of the early settlers were Dutch, with a sprinkling of Huguenot and Quaker families. The settlers lived almost entirely off the land, farming \u2013 berries, fruits and vegetables, as well as hunting, fishing, and trapping.  Early attempts to settle the county by the Dutch were generally unsuccessful, and in 1664 they handed over the territory to the English. Yet the Dutch did leave a legacy in place names like Dunderberg Mountain, Sparkill and High Tor, as well as a small collection of unique sandstone houses like the 1700 DeWint House, built in Tappan and still exists, which later served as George Washington\u2019s headquarters.  During the American Revolutionary War, Rockland County was a strategic crossroads, camping ground and vital link between the northern and southern colonies. Troops often used Kings Ferry at Stony Point and Dobbs Ferry at Snedens Landing in Palisades. The first post office in Rockland County was established at New Antrim, now Suffern, on October 4, 1797.  By 1800, the total population of the newly created County of Rockland was nearly 6,400.  The land was cleared, homes, schools and churches were built and sawmills and gristmills erected along the numerous creeks.  By 1828, Native Americans had virtually disappeared from the county and slavery existed in a diminished form.  History  The area that became Rockland County was originally inhabited by Algonquian-speaking Native Americans, including Munsees, or Lenni Lenape.  The Tappan tribe had a particularly noteworthy presence in the area, extending from present-day Nyack, south to Sparkill and Tappan, down the Hackensack River valley through present-day Bergen County, NJ, and also along the Palisades and Hudson shore all the way down to present-day Edgewater, NJ.  In 1609, Henry Hudson was the first major Dutch explorer to arrive in the area.  Hudson, thinking he had found the legendary \"Northwest Passage\", sailed on the Half Moon up the river that would one day bear his name, and anchored near the area that is now Haverstraw before continuing north of what is now Albany.   In the years before 1664 when the area was formally a Dutch colony called New Netherland, present-day Rockland did not have formal European settlements.  However, individuals did explore the area and made transactions with Tappan tribe for land with the idea that it could have future use.  For example, in 1640, Dutch Captain David Pietersz. de Vries purchased from natives the area where the Sparkill Creek flows into the Hudson River.  In 1664, the British Crown assumed control of New Netherland from the Dutch.  In June of 1664, the Berkeley-Carteret land grant established the colony of New Jersey, dividing present-day Rockland and Bergen Counties into separate political areas.  The northern border of New Jersey was placed in a straight line from the Delaware River at present-day Port Jervis to the Hudson River at 41 degrees even North latitude, where the Palisades Cliffs pause and give way to Sneden's Landing in Orangetown.  The state line remains there to this day, though various disagreements along the exact border were had over the years.  In the 1670s, permanent Dutch settlers began to arrive with land grants, starting with the Tappan area. These settlers were eager to escape \"city life\", moving from Manhattan to Rockland.   A number of unique, Dutch-style red sandstone houses still stand, and many place names in the county reveal their Dutch origin.  In 1683, when the Duke of York (who became King James II of England) established the first 12 counties of New York, present-day Rockland County was part of Orange County, known then as \"Orange County South of the Mountains\". Orangetown was created at the same time under a royal grant, originally encompassing all of modern Rockland County. Around this time, as the English began to colonize Nyack and Tappan, the Native Americans began to leave Rockland in search of undisturbed land further north.  The natural barrier of the Ramapo Mountains and the size of the county made carrying out governmental activities difficult. At one point, two governments were active, one on each side of the Ramapo Mountains, so Rockland split off from Orange in 1798 to form its own county. That same year, the county seat was transferred from Tappan to New City, where a new courthouse was built.  Haverstraw was separated from Orangetown in 1719, and became a town in 1788; it included the present-day Clarkstown, Ramapo, and Stony Point. Clarkstown and Ramapo became towns in 1791, followed by Stony Point in 1865.  During the American Revolution, when control of the Hudson River was viewed by the British as strategic to dominating the American territories, Rockland had skirmishes at Haverstraw, Nyack, and Piermont, and significant military engagements at the Battle of Stony Point, where General \"Mad\" Anthony Wayne earned his nickname. George Washington had headquarters for a time at John Suffern's tavern, the later site of the village of Suffern. British Major John Andr\u00e9 met with American traitor Benedict Arnold near Stony Point to buy the plans for the fortifications at West Point. Andr\u00e9 was captured with the plans in Tarrytown on his way back to the British lines; he was brought to Tappan for trial in the Tappan church, found guilty, hanged, and buried nearby. Still another important chapter in the story of the Revolution was written on May 5, 1783, when General Washington received Sir Guy Carleton at the DeWint House, where they discussed terms of a peace treaty. Two days later, Washington visited Sir Guy aboard a British war vessel. On this day, the king's navy fired its first salute to the flag of the United States of America.  In the decades following the Revolution, Rockland became popular for its stone and bricks. Many buildings in New York City were built with bricks made in Rockland.  These products, however, required quarrying in land that many later believed should be set aside as a preserve. Many unsuccessful efforts were made to turn much of the Hudson Highlands on the northern tip of the county into a forest preserve. Union Pacific Railroad president E. H. Harriman, though, donated land and large sums of money for the purchase of properties in the area of Bear Mountain. Bear Mountain/Harriman State Park became a reality in 1910 when Harriman's widow donated his lands to the state, and by 1914, more than an estimated one million people a year were coming to the park. After World War I, Rockland County became the most important sausage-making hub in New York.  Rockland remained semirural until the 1950s, when the Palisades Interstate Parkway, Tappan Zee Bridge, and other major arteries were built. In the decades that followed, the county became a maturely developed suburb of New York City.  As people moved up from the five boroughs (particularly the Bronx in the early years) the population flourished from 89,276 in 1950 to 338,329 in 2020. A 379% Increase.  Historical settlements In the 19th century, the following settlements were created in these towns. Several have been renamed, some expanded and others disappeared.

Four Union generals and four Medal of Honor recipients lived in Rockland. Abraham P. Stephens - Corporal in Captain Theunis Cooper's Company of Colonel Benjamin J. Gurnee's Regiment  95th New York Volunteer Infantry   The 95th New York Volunteer Infantry, nicknamed \"Warren Rifles\",  fought in the American Civil War under the commandment of Ulysses S.

Thurgood Marshall \u2013 Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States  Other historical figures who lived in Rockland County  John Charles Fr\u00e9mont (January 21, 1813July 13, 1890), was an American military officer, explorer, the first candidate of the Republican Party for the office of President of the United States, and the first presidential candidate of a major party to run on a platform opposing slavery. During the 1840s, that era's penny press accorded Fr\u00e9mont the sobriquet The Pathfinder.  It remains in use, and he is sometimes called \"The Great Pathfinder\".  He is buried at Rockland Cemetery at Sparkill.  Henry Honychurch Gorringe (August 11, 1841 \u2013 July 7, 1885) was a United States naval officer who attained national acclaim for successfully completing the removal of Cleopatra's needle from Alexandria, Egypt to Central Park, New York City. He is buried at Rockland Cemetery at Sparkill.  The Clarksville Witch 1816 Jane  (Naut) Kannif, the widow of a Scotch physician, lived in a small house on Germonds Road in West Nyack. She devoted herself to the care of her only child, a son by a previous marriage, named Tobias Lowrie. She treated, with great results, neighbors that came to her with herbs and methods she learned from her late husband. But \"Naut Kannif\", as she was called, seemed to have been exceedingly eccentric. According to the people at that time she dressed oddly, had strange hairdos and was unsociable. She was regarded as insane \u2013 worse yet \u2013 a witch in an era of superstition. It was decided to take \"Naut\" to Auert Polhemus's grist mill and using his great flour scales weigh her against the old Holland Dutch family Bible, iron bound, with wooden covers and iron chain to carry it by. If outweighed by the Bible, she must be a witch beyond any doubt, and must suffer accordingly. She was taken to the mill against her most earnest protest, put on the scales, and weighed. Weighing more than the Bible, the committee released her. This was the last witch trial in the state of New York.  Hangings in Rockland County There are three recorded hangings in Rockland County. They all took place in the 18th century.  Claudius Smith \u2013 (1736 \u2013 January 22, 1779) was a notorious Loyalist guerrilla leader during the American Revolution.  British Major John Andr\u00e9 \u2013 (May 2, 1750 \u2013 October 2, 1780) was a British army officer hanged as a spy during the American Revolutionary War.  Isaac Jones, 24 years old was hanged on Oct 5, 1792 for a bar room brawl killing.  Early industries The earliest of its industries was the growing of foodstuffs for the great city. Iona Island, known as Weyant's Island  became famous with the noted Iona grape as well as hundreds of fruit trees and vines.  Besides agriculture, boat building was one of the early industries until after the American Civil War.  Johnsontown in Haverstraw was the seat of the first boat building. Nanuet ran a Lumber business. The mountain people in Ladentown made baskets, beer barrel hoops, bowls, chairs, ladles and spoons they made from the wood and reeds found in the mountain to sell or take to New York City to be sold.  Mills, both saw and grist, were among the first industries of the county.  As early as 1792, tanneries were in existence. Theill's Corners, named after a Dane who came to the locality previous to the Revolution erected a forge. Water power of the Minisceongo was used for grinding grist in 1793; A 120-foot dam was constructed across the Ramapo River. By 1813, The Ramapo Works, owned by the Pierson brothers were producing a million pounds of nails annually.  The addition of a cotton mill in 1814, and later woolen mills, nearly doubled the size of the Works, which in 1822 were incorporated under the name \"Ramapo Manufacturing Company.\" During its heyday, the Pierson nail factory was a powerful economic stimulus to the region because of its links to existing agricultural and commercial trade. Ramapo developed into an agricultural marketplace and a locale for manufacturing innovations.  Garnerville was the home of the John Suffern Paper Mill in 1850, and print cotton textile factories. West Haverstraw, once known as Samsondale, was where a large rolling mill was started in 1830;  Ramapo built its early reputation in the iron industry.  Iron mining was opened up by an English company in 1768 and in 1771 a nickel mine.  Because of the proximity of iron mines, numerous metal products were made \u2013 plows, hoes, railings, nails, machinery, even cannonballs. The Ramapo Wheel and Foundry Company, organized in 1873, took the prize among all competitors for the productions of their wheels at the Vienna Exposition of 1873.  Grey and red sandstones were quarried in great quantities, Building stone from local quarries went into the old Capitol at Albany, Fort Lafayette and the old Trinity Church in New York destroyed in the Great Fire of New York (1776), and the first building at Rutgers College.  In 1838 Calvin Tomkins and his brother Daniel purchased approximately  of land, located in a cove north of the Stony Point promontory, limestone was found in usable quantities suitable for burning along the river shore for the purpose of making lime.  Rockland factories made shoes, straw hats, silk and cotton cloth, sulfur matches, smoking pipes and pianos. But the greatest of the industries was the making of brick followed by the ice harvesting.  The first bricks, made for public market, were baked in 1810 on the banks of the Minisceongo, but not until James Wood, of England, set up a brick kiln at Haverstraw, in 1817, was the first successful plant erected.  Wood developed the modern way of mixing coal dust with the clay, in 1828, which revolutionized the manufacture of brick. Commonly referred to as \"Bricktown\", Haverstraw was famous for its brick-making, which was a major industry for the village. Brick-making was so popular due to the clay formed by the Hudson River's water and the rich soil that lined Haverstraw's waterfront, that it was nicknamed the \"Brickmaking Capital of the World\". Many of the old brownstone and brick structures that were constructed in New York City in the late 1890s-early 1900s were composed of bricks manufactured by Haverstraw. At one point, in the early 20th century, there were more than 40 brick-making factories lining the Hudson River within the village. Although brick-making involved all the ethnic groups, 60 percent of the brickyard workers were African-Americans.  Rockland Lake, a beautiful sheet of water a half mile back from the Hudson, at an elevation of more the 150 feet above that river was and is the most notable natural lake and  the source of one of the largest branches of the Hackensack River. Rockland Lake, known to have had the cleanest and purest ice in the area was harvested by The Knickerbocker Ice Company established 1831. The company harvested thousands of tons of ice from the lake each year and once harvested 1 million tons of ice. The wooden storehouse's walls were insulated with sawdust to keep the ice blocks frozen until they were shipped in the summer. By 1834, the company owned a dozen steamboats, 75 ice barges and employed about 3,000 to ship ice countrywide. The stored ice was placed on inclined railroad cars, transported down the mountainside, placed on barges on the Hudson River and shipped to New York City. Slaughter's Landing was used as the shipping point for the Ice harvested at Rockland Lake. So much ice was shipped that Rockland Lake became known as the \"Icehouse of New York City\".  Early Sports  Transportation during the earlier years  Stagecoach  Roads were primitive and transporting products from the western end of the county to the Hudson River was very difficult. After legislative approval, it took 17 years to complete the Nyack Turnpike, a cross-country carriage road which connected Nyack to Suffern. The stagecoach which crossed the Ramapo Pass, was heavily traveled in winter when the Hudson River froze over to travel between Albany, New York and New York City.  Historic steamboats With the lack of roads, travel was largely confined to sloops, which made regular trips up and down the river. Steamboats were built to travel up and down the Hudson, carrying both passengers and freight. Steamboats provided much of the transportation to New York City.  Steamboat navigation in Rockland started with a local steam vessel named the \"Orange\" referred by some as \"Pot-Cheese\" in reference to her beauty and others \u201cThe Flying Dutchman\" because of her speed. She provided regular schedule between Nyack and New York. The North River Steamboat or North River (often erroneously referred to as Clermont) is widely regarded as the world's first commercially successful steamboat. It was not until twenty years later that a boat was used that could be depended on to make a round trip in one day attracting competition from steamboats later built at Haverstraw and Tappan. To facilitate steamboat traffic from Tappan Landing, a road was built over the marshes to the end of a 500-foot pier, which within a few years became the terminus of the New York & Erie Railroad. The construction of this road was an invaluable aid in the development of the county. It caused the building of Piermont with its lone pier which made possible the founding of a half dozen villages and opened the way to the utilization of the mineral and agricultural resources of Rockland. Other railroads followed. The first steamer bringing passengers to the railroad for the historic trip from Piermont to Ramapo was named \"South American\" and the steamer \"Utica\" brought passengers from New York City on the opening of the Erie railroad to Goshen, New York.  Hudson River Day liners included PS Alexander Hamilton, PS Chauncey Vibbard, PS Washington Irving  Prominent Hudson River steamboats included Chancellor Livingston (1816), James Kent (1823), DeWitt Clinton (1828), Robert L. Stevens (1835), Rip Van Winkle (1845), Isaac Newton (1846), Daniel Drew (1860), Thomas Cornell (1863), Chauncey Vibbard (1864), Dean Richmond(1864), Charles W. Morse (1904), Hendrick Hudson (1906), Robert Fulton (1909) constructed or engines built by Allaire Iron Works, Cornelius H. DeLamater, Harlan and Hollingsworth, Jonh Stevens, W. & A. Fletcher Company, West Point Foundry.  Historic railroads In 1833, a charter was given to the New York and Erie Railroad, which had trains running in the county by 1840. New York and Erie Railroad was completed in 1851 becoming the longest railroad in the US  stretching 483 miles from Piermont to Dunkirk on Lake Erie and the second-longest railroad in the world. The President of the United States, Millard Fillmore, 13th President of the United States and the Secretary of State, Daniel Webster, along with a score of national and state officials, boarded the train at the Piermont Pier for the first trip. Back in the 19th century railroads, freight and passenger lines, were instrumental for the development, growth and prosperity of Rockland County. Many of the hamlets and villages were built near the Depots. Most of the Post Offices were built near the stations. Passengers traveling to New York City would board steamers at Piermont. The first five locomotives were \"Eleazar Lord\", \"Piermont\", \"\"Rockland\", \"Orange\" and \"Ramapo\" respectively.

Rockland County places of interest  Rockland County's rocks   Indian Rock \u2013 This 17,300-ton Proterozoic granite gneiss is .8\u20131.2 billion years old. Originating between the Ramapo Mountains and Hudson Highlands, this glacial erratic was deposited in Montebello by the Laurentide Ice Sheet approximately 21,000 years ago.  Maria's Rock \u2013 Front lawn of Pfizer/Wyeth \u2013 (Lederle Laboratories), North Middletown Road in Pearl River \u2013 An 18th-century legend tells of a little girl named Maria who wandered from her home in nearby Tappan and died of hunger and exposure. Tradition says that villagers found her bones near the massive boulder.  Spook Rock is the largest of the cluster of rocks located on Spook Rock Road and Highview Avenue in Airmont. The Tappan and Warawankogs of the Lenni-Lenape Wolf Tribes, an Algonquian people, worshipped the sun, moon, stars, and a spirit called Manitou. Story has it that a Dutch farmer's daughter was sacrificed at this site and her ghost appears on the anniversary of her death.  The Dunderberg Spiral Railway A pleasure railroad partially constructed in 1890\u20131891 and never finished. The first part of the ride would have taken the cars up two inclined planes to the summit  above the Hudson River, where visitors could disembark to enjoy the scenery. Then the cars would have coasted by gravity down a nine-mile (14\u00a0km) scenic railway, making two spirals and three switchbacks. It would have been to this day the biggest roller coaster ever constructed.  Piermont hand-cranked drawbridge The Piermont hand-cranked drawbridge was originally built in 1880 by The King Iron Bridge Company, a Cleveland company in the state of Ohio that constructed more than 10,000 bridges over six decades. The hand-cranked drawbridge is used as a pedestrian walkway providing a link to Tallman Mountain State Park.  This bridge is the only hand-cranked drawbridge in Rockland County and perhaps in the United States.  Back in the day, fishermen on sloops heading up and down the creek got out of their vessel, cranked up the drawbridge, sailed across, got out of their vessel and cranked down the drawbridge for vehicular traffic. The whole bridge was dismantled piece by piece, sent off-site for restoration and restored to its original state after a complete forensic analysis. Allan King Sloan, the great-great-grandson of the company's founder, provided some of the information that is on the historical marker nearby and attended the dedication ceremony on August 7, 2009.

It was named in honor of theStack Rocks, a phenomenon of five erratic stacks rising from the Hudson River near its western boundary with New Jersey, in the area of Doodletown. The stacks are a major feature of the county seal. Rockland's early history is closely tied to the geography and history of the Hudson River. The river was the main transportation artery in the region, and Rockland's location along it gave the county its initial importance. The area that now includes Rockland was first inhabited by the Lenape natives, who lived in the region for thousands of years. In 1609, the Dutch voyager Henry Hudson explored the river and settled in the area. He and his crew traded with the local natives, and the river became known as the North River, as it flows north from the Atlantic Ocean to its source. In 1664, the English took control of the region. It was then that the Dutch name for the river, Noort Rivier, was anglicized to the Hudson River. The city of New York was founded as New Amsterdam at the southern tip of Manhattan in 1625, and grew to be an important colonial port. In the 18th century, the region that now includes Rockland was the western portion of Orange County. It included the towns of Newburgh, Wallkill, and Goshen. Rockland became its own county in 1798, when it was split from Orange. During the American Revolution, Rockland was the site of many battles and troop movements. The British military occupied the county for seven years, as they moved troops and supplies between New York City and the northern colonies. The main route of the British army was the King's Highway, which runs through the county from New Jersey to New York. In the 19th century, the opening of the Erie Canal across New York State in 1825 created a major new transportation route that connected the region to the west. As the canal ran through the length of the state, the importance of the Hudson River as an economic artery began to wane.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 30971498}
