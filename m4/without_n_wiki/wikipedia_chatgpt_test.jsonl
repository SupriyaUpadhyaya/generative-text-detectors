The name Dongas comes from the Matabele word for \"gully\", given by Winchester locals to the deep drovers' tracks on Twyford Down.\n\nJohn Vidal, writing in The Guardian in 2012, said of The Dongas that \"the 15-20 urban youths who camped out to try to defend Twyford Down in 1992 are recognised to have fired up British environmental protest and kickstarted a major shift in green attitudes in both government and the public.\"\n\nHistory\n\nThe Twyford Down protest was a protest against the M3 motorway extension which destroyed some rich ecological sites, one of the very few habitats of the Chalkhill Blue butterfly and six species of rare orchid, and ancient monuments there (SSSI and Scheduled Ancient Monument). The Conservative government was planning to construct a new roadway through the area in order to save three minutes of transit time between London and Southampton.\n\nFollowing \"Yellow Wednesday\", when hordes of police and security guards invaded the camp to bulldoze the area, the Dongas Tribe left Twyford Down for Bramdean Common.  Earth First!, who had been heavily involved in the setting up and support of the camp and actions, continued the protests and restarted a camp in Plague Pits Valley.\n\nThey constituted about twenty people. Of them, seven were sent to prison in 1993 for breaking an injunction. In one incident, around fifty protesters chained themselves to a bridge, leading to the arrest of some. At least one protester (Paul Kingsnorth) subsequently sued the police and received a $5000 settlement.\n\nSome of the 'original Dongas' (as they became called) of the mid 1990s were musicians who made a living by busking, sometimes using traditional music from Brittany.\n\nThe first child born in the Dongas tribe, to Rosie Lambert, was named May Brigit \"Donga\" Lambert and was born on 1 May 1994, Beltane and May Day.\n\nIn late 2012, original members of the Dongas, as well as hundreds of others, returned to the hillside on the protest's 20th anniversary. They expressed warnings about the government's more than forty new road plans.\n\nInfluence \nThe Dongas road protests inspired a major change in green attitudes among both the public and the government, radicalizing a generation of British youth. Among them, Paul Kingsnorth of The Dark Mountain Project credits his arrest at Twyford Down as his impetus for engaging in further protests.\n\nSee also\nDirect Action\nRebecca Lush\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n Alun Howkins (2002), \"From Diggers to Dongas: the Land in English Radicalism, 1649\u20132000.\" History Workshop Journal 54(1), pp. 1\u201323.\n\nExternal links\nDongas Tribe musical field recordings\n\"Call for Donga for Rath Lugh\"\n\nAnti-road protest\nDIY culture\nSquatters' movements", "machine_text": "Dongas road protest group is an environmentalist group that emerged in the Dongas municipality of Zimbabwe in 2003. The group has been fighting against the construction of a proposed highway that would have connected the city of Harare to neighboring towns. The proposed highway was set to pass through a mountainous area that served as a habitat for many endangered species, including the black rhinoceros, elephant, and lion. The Dongas road protest group was founded to protect this ecologically sensitive area from the proposed construction. The group organized peaceful protests, hunger strikes, and public awareness campaigns to bring attention to the environmental risks posed by the highway construction. The group received support from various organizations such as the Zimbabwe Conservation Task Force and the African Wildlife Foundation. These organizations recognized the importance of preserving the vulnerable ecosystem and supported the Dongas road protest group. In 2005, the government of Zimbabwe granted a concession to a Chinese construction company for the development of the proposed highway. This led to a crackdown on the protests, and the Dongas road protest group was disbanded. Several members of the group were arrested, and the construction of the highway began. Despite the apparent failure of the group\u2019s mission, some members continue to advocate for the preservation of the remaining ecologically sensitive areas in Zimbabwe. The Dongas road protest group has inspired similar movements across the country, with various groups standing up for environmental protection and challenging unsustainable development projects. The protest movement has brought attention to the adverse effects of developing roads and highways on the natural environment and the wildlife. It has also underscored the importance of inclusive and participatory decision-making processes in infrastructure development and highlighted the need for environmental impact assessments.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 277934}

Though the time of its establishment could not be ascertained, historians believe that the river fort was built by Mir Jumla II, a Subahdar of Bengal under the Mughal Empire, to defend Dhaka and Narayanganj from pirates.\n\nHistory\nBengal went under the effective control of the Mughal Empire in 1574 AD after the defeat of Daud Khan Karrani by the Mughal General Munim Khan. Mughals exercised a progressive rule in Bengal and were determined to protect their subjects from external forces.\n\nMir Jumla II was appointed as the Subahdar or governor of the then Bengal province in 1660 AD. He was aware of the pirates who ran a campaign of terror in the important cities of Bengal. In a quest to protect the capital Dhaka from the pirates, Mir Jumla II decided to build three river forts around Dhaka, including Sonakanda Fort.\n\nThough archaeologists cannot trace any evidence on its date of establishment, according to historians the construction of the fort started between 1660 and 1663 AD.\n\nStructure\n\nThe fort combines thick walls, a massive artillery platform and a gateway to the north.\n\nThe fort has two main parts. One is a fortified defensive wall of gigantic dimensions. The defensive walls are 3.05 metres in height and thicker at the bottom. Several wide and narrow loopholes allowed guns and light cannons to fire shells at the pirates. The other one is a raised outwork on the western face to defend the fort from the attack of the pirates.\n\nThe most significant structure of the fort is the massive artillery platform. One of the spherical artillery platforms has a stairway, which leads up to the artillery platform. Cannons with bigger calibre were placed on there, aiming at the aggressors coming up the Shitalakshya River. This is a unique feature of the river forts built by Mughal Empire.\n\nThe platform is surrounded by two circular structures of which the diameter of the inner one is 15.70 metres and the diameter of the outer one is 19.35 metres. The structure is 6.09 metres in height and surrounded by walls.\n\nThe fort is quadrangular in plan, measuring 86.56 by 57.0 metres. There are octagonal bastions on the four corners of the fort. The corner bastions on both sides of the western wing are wider than those of the eastern wing, which are 4.26 metres, while the two on the western wing are 6.85 metres in width.\n\nThe only gate of the fort is on the north. The arched entrance is placed within a rectangular frame. The gateway is higher than the average height of the walls of fort and decorated with several groomed panels.\n\nMyths\n\nThere are a number of myths related to the river fort that include tragedy and mystery.\n\n Princess Swarnamoyee was abandoned by her father Kedar Roy, a king of Bikrampur. She went to the Shitalakshya River with her barge to perform the sacred bath. Unfortunately, the pirates attacked her barge that day and looted all the valuables she had. They also kidnapped the princess. She was later saved by Isa Khan, the ruler of Sonargaon. Isa Khan brought her to the Sonakanda Fort and asked her father to take her back. Kedar Roy, however, refused to take her back as she had lost her caste by spending a night in a tent owned by a Muslim ruler.\n\nSwarnamoyee, shocked by the incident, cried for several days in her tent at Sonakanda Fort. According to a popular belief the name of the fort is derived from this incident as the Swarnamoyee in other words Sona, cried a lot in this fort. The Bengali for crying is kanda.\n\n Another version of the story says that Isa Khan forcefully married Sona Bibi, a widowed daughter of Kedar Roy. She was brought to this fort and put under confinement by Isa Khan's soldiers. She cried following the incident and the name of the fort derived from that.\n Some people believe that there were some hidden tunnels in the fort that linked it with Sonargaon and Lalbagh Fort.\n\nSee also\n Hajiganj Fort\n Idrakpur Fort\n List of archaeological sites in Bangladesh\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n The World Monuments Fund's 2008 Watch List page for Sonakanda Fort\n\nPalaces in Bangladesh\nForts in Bangladesh\nNarayanganj", "machine_text": "Sonakanda Fort is an ancient fort located in the Narayanganj district of Bangladesh. It is situated on the eastern bank of the Ichamati River, about 20 kilometers away from Dhaka, the capital city of Bangladesh. The fort was built during the Mughal Empire in the early 17th century. It was initially constructed to protect the area from Portuguese and pirates attacks. The fort was built of bricks and stones and was initially circular in shape. It has a diameter of 300 feet and has walls that are 8 feet thick. The fort comprises of two gates, one facing east and the other facing west, which leads to a courtyard inside the fort. The fort also has a three-storey watchtower that offers a panoramic view of the surrounding area. During the British period, Sonakanda Fort was used as a customs office and was then converted into a jail. In 1971, during the Bangladesh Liberation War, the fort was used as a hideout by the freedom fighters. The fort was later declared as a protected historical monument by the Bangladesh government. In recent years, Sonakanda Fort has become a popular tourist destination. People from all over the country come to visit this ancient fort, which holds great historical significance. A project has been proposed to renovate the fort and to make it more accessible to visitors. Sonakanda Fort is not only a symbol of the rich history of Bangladesh but also a testament to the architectural brilliance of the Mughal Empire.

The term fluids includes liquids or gases, but also may refer to materials that behave with fluid-like  properties, including crowds of people or large numbers  of grains if those are describable approximately under the continuum hypothesis as used in continuum mechanics.\n\nUnsteady and convective effects\nThe composition of the material contains two types of terms: those involving the time derivative and those involving spatial derivatives. The time derivative portion is denoted as the local derivative, and represents the effects of unsteady flow. The local derivative occurs during unsteady flow, and becomes zero for steady flow.\n\nThe portion of the material derivative represented by the spatial derivatives is called the convective derivative. It accounts for the variation in fluid property, be it velocity or temperature for example, due to the motion of a fluid particle in space where its values are different.\n\nAcceleration field\nThe acceleration of a particle is the time rate of change of its velocity. Using an Eulerian description for velocity, the velocity field V = V(x,y,z,t), and deriving it with respect to time, we obtain the acceleration field.\n\nReferences\n\nKinematics\nFluid mechanics", "machine_text": "Fluid kinematics is a subfield of fluid mechanics that deals with the study of fluids in motion, particularly their motion and deformation without considering the forces that cause the motion. It is concerned with the study of the geometric and kinematic aspects of fluid flow without worrying about the physical reasons for the flow behaviour. Fluid kinematics plays a crucial role in the analysis of fluid motion in a wide variety of scientific and engineering applications. The study of fluid kinematics involves investigating the methods used to describe the motion of fluids, including the use of mathematical models and graphical representations. The primary quantitative measures of fluid kinematics are velocity and acceleration, which are used to study the movement of fluids over time. In addition, fluid kinematics also focuses on the study of other fluid flow variables such as vorticity, circulation, and streamlines, which describe the behaviour of fluids under different conditions. The concept of fluid kinematics can be applied to various fields, including mechanical, civil, and chemical engineering. In mechanical engineering, fluid kinematics is used to determine the efficiency of fluid flow in hydraulic systems. In civil engineering, it is used to analyze river and groundwater flow. In chemical engineering, it is employed in designing chemical processing plants to predict the flow patterns of the fluids being used. In summary, fluid kinematics is essential in understanding how fluids behave and move without considering the forces that cause the motion. It provides a mathematical method for describing the behaviour of fluids and helps scientists and engineers in various fields to design efficient and effective systems while accounting for the behaviour of fluids.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 45498354}

His maternal grandfather, Claude Dauphin, was a French actor. His younger brother, James Newman, is also an actor. Newman was raised in Greenwich Village, and attended Saint Ann's School.  He was interested in performing from an early age, often performing Fozzie Bear routines for friends and family. He started stand-up comedy at the age of ten as part of the 'Kidsncomedy' program run by Jo Ann Grossman. His material was mostly political, workshopped with his father. He began getting some attention from agents at this time, though his parents were reluctant for him to pursue a career in acting. His first onscreen appearance was as 'Teenage Fan' in the mockumentary The Buried Secret of M. Night Shyamalan. His role was mostly cut for the film. As a teenager, Newman regularly attended Buck's Rock Performing and Creative Arts Camp.\n\nNewman started college in 2007 at California Institute of the Arts with the intention of becoming a filmmaker. He dropped out after seven months in order to pursue a career in comedy and acting.\n\nCareer\nNewman's first major onscreen appearance is in the film The Treatment in 2006 as high school student Scott. He went on to play roles in a number of shorts and student films. He also began performing stand-up regularly around this time and produced a one-man show titled Grifftopia, which he performed in 2009 and 2010.\n\nIn 2010, Newman appeared in the teen film Beware The Gonzo in the role of Horny Rob Becker, one of the friends of the titular Gonzo (Ezra Miller). Though the film was released to mixed reviews, Newman's performance was positively reviewed, with Odie Henderson from RogerEbert.com writing that \"Becker is the most interesting character in the film.\"\n\nOver the next few years, Newman guest starred in a number of television shows, including Blue Bloods, Big Lake, and Law and Order: Special Victims Unit, as well as appearing in sketches for FunnyOrDie.

Quickly recognized for her natural swimming ability and competitive spirit, Imgard was invited to join the swimming team of the Washington Athletic Club in 1935, soon winning numerous local, regional, statewide, and multi-state telegraph races, and was a member of the 400-yard relay team that won the National Championship in 1938.  Groomed to compete in 1940 Summer Olympics, she continued competitive swimming after the outbreak of World War II, even though the Olympic games were suspended by the IOC.  It is very likely, had it not been for the war, she would have competed on the United States Olympic swim team, possibly alongside peer, Esther Williams of California. \n \nShe made a career as a civil servant for the Federal Government for over 40 years; starting with the Department of the Interior at Mount Rainier National Park in Washington state after graduating from college, the Department of the War (Army & Air Force) in California during the latter part of World War II, and the Social Security Administration from about 1953 in various states, including California, Kansas, Maryland and finally Washington, where she retired about 1982.\n\nIrma married Melvin Leroy Cole of Arkansas in 1955 in Ellensburg, Washington.  Because they both worked for the same government agency, after married they rarely resided in the same city.  Although two children were born of this union, partly as a result of this forced separation, they divorced in 1963.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Permanent private hall\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "A permanent private hall (PPH) in the University of Oxford is an educational institution within the university. There are six permanent private halls at Oxford, five of which admit undergraduates. They were founded by different Christian denominations. The principal difference between a college and a PPH is that whereas the former are governed by the fellows of the college, the governance of a PPH resides, at least in part, with the corresponding Christian denomination.\n\nStudents at PPHs are members of the University of Oxford and have full access to the university's facilities and activities. Regent's Park College is the largest PPH, and admits men and women of any age. St Benet's Hall formerly only accepted male students, but has admitted women as graduates since 2014 and as undergraduates since 2016. Blackfriars, St Stephen's House, and Wycliffe Hall were all male-only institutions historically, but all three are now co-educational, training ordinands for their respective denominations, and also admitting students for a range of other courses of study. Campion Hall admits Jesuits and priests of other orders and congregations who are graduate students. It occasionally accepts non-ordained students and ministers of other churches.\n\nHistory\n\nPrivate halls\n\nThe Oxford University Act 1854 and the university statute De aulis privatis (On private Halls) of 1855, allowed any Master of Arts aged at least 28 years to open a private hall after obtaining a licence to do so. The longest lived of the thirteen private halls was Charsley's Hall (1862\u20131891). Notable masters of private halls included William Edward Addis and George Butler.\n\nThe Universities Tests Act 1871 opened all university degrees and positions to men who were not members of the Church of England (subject to safeguards for religious instruction and worship), which made it possible for Roman Catholics and Nonconformists to open private halls. These non-Anglican private halls included Clarke's Hall (now Campion Hall), opened by the Jesuit Order in 1896, and Hunter Blair's Hall (now St Benet's Hall) opened by the Benedictine Order in 1899.\n\nPermanent private halls\nIn 1918 the university passed a statute to allow private halls which were not run for profit to become permanent private halls and the two halls took their current names.\n\nIn some cases, a PPH can be granted full collegiate status; recent examples include Mansfield College (became a full college in 1995) and Harris Manchester College (became a full college in 1996). However, one hall, Greyfriars (1224; refounded 1910), closed at the end of the academic year 2007\u201308, as the Franciscan order which ran and funded it could no longer afford the expense. Greyfriars' students were transferred to Regent's Park College when it closed.\n\nList of permanent private halls\n\nFormer permanent private halls\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n Regulations for the Establishment and Maintenance of Permanent Private Halls\n Review of the Permanent Private Halls associated with the University of Oxford\n\n \nTerminology of the University of Oxford", "machine_text": "A Permanent private hall (PPH) is a type of educational institution in England and Wales that is affiliated with and recognized by a university but operates independently. It was first established in the University of Oxford during the 19th century but has since spread to other universities in the United Kingdom, including the University of Durham and the University of London. PPHs are similar to constituent colleges in that they offer a range of academic programs and provide accommodation and support services to their students. However, unlike constituent colleges, PPHs do not have formal status within the university, and their students are not members of the university\u2019s central student body. Instead, PPHs operate under their own governing bodies and have their own admission requirements and procedures. The first PPH in Oxford was established in 1856 when the Catholic Church was officially permitted to form its own tertiary institution. Since then, several other PPHs have been established in Oxford, including Blackfriars Hall, Campion Hall, and St Benet's Hall. Each PPH has its own unique history and character, but they all share a commitment to providing a high-quality education within a supportive and inclusive environment. PPHs have been praised for their ability to offer a more personalized educational experience than larger universities while still providing the benefits of being affiliated with a larger institution. This has made them an attractive option for students who value small class sizes, close relationships with faculty members, and a strong sense of community. Overall, Permanent Private Halls have played a vital role in the higher education landscape in England and Wales, providing a unique and valuable learning experience for generations of students.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 582841}

This unrest was provoked by the death of Hassan Evan Naseem at Maafushi Prison - located on a separate inhabited island - and the subsequent shooting at the same prison, that killed 3 and injured 17 others.\n\nMany government buildings, vehicles and other public properties were set on fire, some were destroyed. The government controlled the unrest by around 23:00 and declared a State of Emergency in Mal\u00e9 and nearby islands. Late night curfews were enforced from 22:00 to 04:30 in Mal\u00e9 for more than a month following the rioting.\n\nNaseem's death\nOn Friday September 19, 2003, Naseem, who was serving at Maafushi Jail for drug abuse related offenses, was beaten by the NSS personnel of the security unit in the jail. This led to Naseem's death the following day. The beating came about as punishment for the disturbances from complicated disputes between Naseem's inmates and \"neighboring\" prisoners. To control the disturbances caused by these disputes (and reportedly to investigate this incident) security personnel came with a list of \"troublemakers\". Though it is said that, Naseem was not involved in the above-mentioned incident his name appeared on the list. The security guards then had gone in to round-up the listed prisoners. Naseem had resisted and had refused to leave his cell, demanding reasons for his summoning. This resistance ended up injuring a security guard which led to numerous members of the security unit storming into the cell. Naseem was then moved to solitary confinement (referred to as \"the range\"). On the same night he was severely beaten up by 12 officers. He died in the early morning of September 20, 2003, largely due to injuries sustained to his lungs from the beating.\n\nShooting incident\n\nInmates of Naseem learned of his death at around 11:00 on 20 September 2003. On receiving this news, they demanded to meet with a Security officer from the Department of Corrections. There was no response to these repeated demands. Some of the prisoners refused to take lunch to reflect their concern about Naseem's death.\n\nFuneral prayers were performed by Naseem's inmates and many other prisoners, after mid-day prayers. Shortly afterwards a loud uproar came from Block C where Naseem's cell was located. Two inmates then jumped out of cell C3 after its corrugated iron sheets were pushed open. More prisoners followed them and attacked jail security unit personnel. They tried to calm the prisoners down for a while and then dispersed them when the prisoners refused to cease their attack. By now more inmates came out of the Block C and opened other Blocks, facilitating more prisoners to come out.\n\nCaptain Adam Mohamed, in charge of security unit, was informed of this uprising. He issued instructions to block the premises. Upon Mohamed's instruction to block the premises, Jail Security Unit personnel were issued riot gear. Prisoners on the loose confronted with this unit. Since prisoners highly outnumbered them, security personnel in riot gear soon retreated.\n\nThe angry mob then turned to Adam Mohamed himself. Mohamed Faseeh, a prisoner from the crowd, questioned him about Naseem's death, to which he did not respond reasonably. During this confrontation, Adam Mohamed ordered security units to take arms. Sergeant Shahid Ali Manik, shot the first shots into the air at 12:30. He then aimed and shot at Faseeh without further warning. Subsequently, Private Hassan Rifaau, Private Ahmed Mujuthaba Hussain and Private Mohamed Jinaah shot the prisoners. Some were shot from behind while retreating, others directly from the front.\n\nTwelve rifles were issued from the armory and 15 persons had possession of them during the rampage.\n\nFatalities and casualties\nA total of 20 people, including a security officer, were shot during the shooting incident at Maafushi prison. Fifteen of the 20 were shot above the knees and 9 of them were directly shot from behind while retreating. Six were shot from front and bullet entry points were not determinable in 5 persons.

Two died in a Sri Lankan hospital while being treated.\n\nUnrest\nNaseem was taken to Indira Gandhi Memorial Hospital, on September 20, 2003, in Mal\u00e9. News of his death soon began to spread by word of mouth. By noon, many learnt about Naseem's death. People soon started gathering near the hospital to witness and to verify. Access was denied to the public and relatives, except for his mother and father.\n\nA large number of people gathered at his burial service. While people were at the cemetery, news of the shooting incident reached the already angry public. Civil unrest in Mal\u00e9 started with this news. Several police stations were set on fire, government buildings were attacked, and government vehicles were set on fire or destroyed by the angry mob. Among the key places target were The Elections Division office, the Majlis and the High Court.\n\nTear gas drifted through the streets of Mal\u00e9 in the late evening and police used force to control the mob when as they reached Shaheed Hussain Adam Building. By 23:00, several people were arrested. President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom addressed to the nation soon after controlling the riot.\n\nInvestigation\nGayoom established a Presidential Commission on September 20, 2003 to investigate Naseem's death and the shooting incident at Maafushi Prison. The findings of the commission were released to the public with the title \"Report on the Death of Hassan Evan Naseem\" and \"Investigative Findings on the Incident of Shooting at Maafushi jail\" respectively. However, several sections from these public report were omitted due to national security concerns.\n\nDuring the investigation, survivors were interviewed and investigation teams were sent to Nawaloka Hospital and Apollo Hospital in Colombo where those who survived were being treated.

The unrest began on August 12, 2003, following the death of a Maldivian prisoner, Hassan Evan Naseem, who was allegedly tortured to death in police custody. The protests started in the capital city of Mal\u00e9 and quickly spread to other islands. The protesters demanded an independent inquiry into Naseem's death and called for political reform and greater freedom of expression. The riots turned violent, with protesters setting fire to government buildings and clashing with security forces. A state of emergency was declared, and the government banned public gatherings and imposed a curfew. The unrest lasted for three days, during which time several protesters were detained and dozens were injured. The government eventually agreed to an independent inquiry into Naseem's death and promised to begin a dialogue with opposition political parties. The 2003 civil unrest was a significant moment in the history of the Maldives, which has been ruled by President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom since 1978. The riots marked the first time that significant numbers of Maldivians openly challenged the government. The incident also drew international attention to human rights abuses in the Maldives and led to increased pressure on President Gayoom to reform the country's political system. The 2003 civil unrest set the stage for further political and social upheaval in the Maldives, including the 2008 Maldives presidential election, which saw the election of President Mohamed Nasheed, the country's first democratically elected leader. The events of 2003 remain a significant moment in the post-colonial history of the Maldives and continue to be remembered by many Maldivians today.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2333267}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Wesley O. Smith\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Wesley Oliver Smith (April 16, 1878October 20, 1951), commonly known as W. O. Smith, was an American newspaper publisher and businessman from southern Oregon.  He owned the Klamath Republican and later the Evening Herald, both Klamath Falls newspapers.  Smith was a Republican who served two two-year terms in the Oregon House of Representatives, representing what are today Crook, Deschutes, Grant, Jefferson, Klamath, and Lake counties.\n\nEarly life \n\nSmith was born on April 16, 1878 in French Lake, an unincorporated area of New Brunswick, Canada.  He was the son of George F. Smith and Anna Smith.  His family left Canada and moved to Eau Claire, Wisconsin, when he was eight years old.\n\nIn 1895, Governor William H. Upham commissioned Smith as a second lieutenant in the Wisconsin National Guard.  He served in Company E of the Third Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry from the time of his commissioning to August 1897.  Company E was based in Eau Claire.  With the onset of the Spanish\u2013American War, Smith rejoined the Wisconsin National Guard as a non-commissioned officer.  He served as first sergeant for Company E.  After the war, Smith moved to Harrison, Idaho, where he briefly worked cruising timber before moving on to Klamath Falls, Oregon.\n\nLife in Klamath Falls \n\nIn Klamath Falls, Smith worked for a short time in the lumber business. Then in 1903, he bought the Klamath Republican from W. Huse and Sons.  The Klamath Republican was a weekly newspaper that had been published in Klamath Falls since 1896.  When he took charge of the paper, Klamath Falls had five newspapers competing for reads in a community of only 3,000 people.\n\nSmith married Jessie Applegate on December 11, 1904.  She was the youngest daughter of Captain Ivan D. Applegate, an early Klamath County pioneer.  Nine months later, she died in Klamath Falls, three days after giving birth to a son.  Smith married his second wife, Lena L. Hargus, on October 24, 1906.  She was the widow of Doctor H. B. Hargus, and was also the sister of Smith\u2019s first wife.  They remained together for the rest of his life.\n\nIn 1908, Smith acquired another Klamath Falls newspaper, the Evening Herald (now the Herald and News), from its founder Fred Cronemiller.  After buying the Evening Herald, he purchased and installed a new Linotype machine, the first automated typesetting machine in the Klamath Falls area.  Under his management, the Evening Herald became the area\u2019s leading newspaper.  Smith continued to publish the Klamath Republican along with the Herald.  He eventually changed the Klamath Republican from a weekly to a semi-weekly publication.  In 1914, he merged it in to the Evening Herald as a semi-weekly supplement.\n\nSmith also started a printing business in Klamath Falls.  His printing firm was called W. O. Smith Printing Company.  While it was separate from his newspaper, it was located in the same building as the Evening Herald.\n\nSmith was also a prominent member of the Klamath Falls community.  He was active in civic affairs and local politics.  He helped finance construction of the local Odd Fellows building, the first large office building in Klamath Falls.  He also joined the local Elks lodge and helped raise funds to build the Klamath Falls Elks building.  Smith later served as president of the local Elks lodge.  In politics, he was a strong supporter of the Republican Party, serving as a recording clerk for the Klamath Falls voting precinct and then as chairman of the Klamath County Republican Central Committee.\n\nState representative \n\nIn 1912, Smith decided to run as a Republican for a District 21 seat in the Oregon House of Representatives.  At that time, District 21 had two seats that represented Grant, Klamath, and Lake counties as well as Crook County (which at that time, still included what are now Deschutes and Jefferson counties).  Smith and Vernon A. Forbes of Bend were the only Republicans to file for the District 21 seats. Since the Republican Party was allowed to nominate two candidates for the two District 21 seats, Smith and Forbes were both nominated in the Republican primary.  Since no Democratic candidates filed for the District 21 seats, Smith and Forbes were unopposed in the general election.\n\nSmith took his seat in the Oregon House of Representatives on January 13, 1913, representing District 21.  He worked through the 1913 legislative session which ended on March 5.  During the session, he served on the powerful ways and means committee as well as the irrigation committee.  Later in the session, Smith was appointed to a special committee assigned to investigate conditions in Oregon\u2019s state prisons.  Smith was an active member of the House throughout the session.  A fiscal conservative, Smith successfully pushed a bill through the legislature that standardized government accounting within the state.  After the session, he received special recognition from eastern Oregon farmers for his work on the irrigation committee.\n\nIn 1914, Smith decided to run for re-election, seeking to retain his District 21 House seat.  He was joined by fellow incumbent Republican, Vernon Forbes.  There were also two candidates running in the Democratic primary, P. H. Dencer of Bend and Fred W. Hyndman of Klamath Falls.  Since there were two District 21 seats available both parties could nominate two candidates for the general election.  As a result, all four candidates were advanced to the general election.  In the November election, Smith and Forbes retained their House seats.  The final general election tally was 1,366 votes for Smith, 1,157 votes for Forbes, 982 votes for Hyndman, and 742 votes for Dencer.\n\nSmith began his second term representing House District 21 on January 11, 1915. The session lasted six weeks, ending on February 20.  During the session, Smith was appointed to the ways and means, irrigation, military affairs, and printing committees.\n\nIn 1916, Smith ran for a third term in the Oregon House of Representatives.  Since the 1914 election, Jefferson County had been separated from Crook County and Deschutes County was in the process of being created.  While these changes did not alter the boundaries of District 21, it did add two new counties to the district.  While Smith and Forbes had been the only two Republicans to file for the District 21 seats in the past two elections, two additional Republicans decided to join the field in 1916.  The two new Republican candidates were Denton G. Burdick of Redmond and Albert E. Elder of Klamath Falls.  In addition, Fred Hyndman filed as a Democrat.  In the Republican primary, Forbes and Burdick were advanced to the general election while Hyndman was nominated in the Democratic primary.\n\nIn 1920 and 1922, several Oregon newspapers identified Smith as a possible candidate for one of the District 21 seats.  However, he did not run for state office again.\n\nLater life \n\nAfter his 1916 primary defeat, Governor James Withycombe appointed Smith as Oregon\u2019s delegate to the International Farm Congress and the International Irrigation Congress.  Both meetings were held in El Paso, Texas, in October 1916.\n\nIn 1920, Smith sold the Evening Herald to E. J. Murray so he could focus on his commercial printing business.  He modernized the company's printing operation, acquiring a new press with an automatic press feeder system.  In 1926, Smith moved his business to a new modern building in downtown Klamath Falls. Four years later, W. O. Smith Printing Company merged with Drummond Printing of Klamath Falls.  The new business brought together a full suite of modern printing equipment under one roof.  The company was incorporated in 1929 as Smith-Bates.  It was capitalized at $50,000 with 500 shares valued at $100 per share.  Smith and his wife were primary shareholders.\n\nInstead of returning to state politics, Smith ran for a city council position in Klamath Falls.  He was elected and took his seat in 1921.  He served two terms on the city council.  After leaving the council, he continued to serve Klamath Falls as chairman of the city\u2019s budget committee.  In 1930, the city of Klamath Fall decided to update its city charter.  Smith was appointed chairman of the 15-person committee that evaluated various options for improving the city\u2019s government.  His committee recommended the city adopt a new form of government based on a city manager structure.\n\nSmith also remained involved in fraternal and civic affairs.  He was active in the local Elks lodge.  He helped establish a Boy Scout program in Klamath Falls.  Smith was also a founding member of the local Rotary club and was that organization\u2019s first president. In addition, he served as president and trustee of the local golf country club.  \n\nDue to an extended illness, Smith was confined to his home for the last six years of his life.  He died at his home in Klamath Falls on October 20, 1951 at the age 73.  His funeral service was held at the Klamath Falls Elks lodge on October 23, 1951.  Smith was buried in the Linkville Cemetery in Klamath Falls.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n List of Oregon Legislators by Session\n Wesley Oliver Smith at Find a Grave\n\nMembers of the Oregon House of Representatives\nPoliticians from Klamath Falls, Oregon\nOregon city council members\nOregon Republicans\nBusinesspeople from Oregon\nEditors of Oregon newspapers\n1878 births\n1951 deaths\nPeople from Sunbury County, New Brunswick\nCanadian emigrants to the United States\nWisconsin National Guard personnel\nPoliticians from Eau Claire, Wisconsin\nPeople from Kootenai County, Idaho\n19th-century American people\n20th-century American people", "machine_text": "Wesley O.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Arthur Arz von Strau\u00dfenburg\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Generaloberst Arthur Freiherr Arz von Strau\u00dfenburg (; 16 June 1857 \u2013 1 July 1935) was an Austro-Hungarian colonel general and last Chief of the General Staff of the Austro-Hungarian Army. At the outbreak of the First World War, he commanded the 15th Infantry Division. Soon, he was promoted to the head of the 6th Corps and the First Army. He participated on the Gorlice\u2013Tarn\u00f3w Offensive in 1915 and the countryside of Romania in 1916. In March 1917, he became Chief of the General Staff until his resignation on 3 November 1918.\n\nEarly life\nBorn into a Protestant family that was among the ancient Saxon settlers of east Transylvania, Arz was the product of a noble \"Siebenb\u00fcrger\" family. His father, Albert Arz von Strau\u00dfenburg, served as an evangelical preacher and curate as well as a member of the House of Magnates. Schooled in Dresden and Hermannstadt, Arz graduated \"with great achievement\", and went on to read law at a university, during which time he volunteered for one year's service in a Hungarian Feldj\u00e4ger battalion during 1876\u20131877.\n\nEarly career\nHaving successfully completed a year's military service, Arz sat and passed the reserve officers examination and went on to apply for and successfully obtain a commission as a regular officer. In 1878, he was commissioned with the rank Leutnant.\n\n \nAttaining the rank of Oberleutnant, Arz attended the Imperial Kriegschule in Vienna, 1885\u20131887, where he again distinguished himself, and in 1888 he was appointed to the General Staff. Promoted to Hauptmann and assigned to a corps staff, Arz was made Adjutant to Feldzeugmeister Baron Sch\u00f6nfelda before returning to the General Staff in 1898, where he was to remain, with a few breaks, until 1908.\n\nPromoted next to the rank of Major, then Oberstleutnant, Arz was attached to the 2nd Corps, then commanded by Archduke Eugen, following his assignment to the General Staff.  On 1 May 1902 he was promoted to Oberst and appointed to the managing bureau of the General Staff, of which department he was appointed head in May 1903. The same year, he married Stefanie Tomka von Tomkahaza und Falkusfalva, a Hungarian noblewoman,  with whom he had a daughter.\n\nIn 1908, Arz was again promoted, this time to the rank of Generalmajor, and was given command of the 61st Infantry Brigade. Having been steadily promoted and seen as a promising and competent officer, he received an \"outstanding\" evaluation from his old commander, Archduke Eugen, during 1911's fall maneuvres. 1912 saw him promoted to command a division, the 15th infantry at Miskolc. Soon afterwards Arz attained the rank of Feldmarschall-Leutnant and in 1913 was reassigned to the war ministry in Vienna to head up a section.\n\nFirst World War\n\nThe opening\nAt the outbreak of war in the Summer of 1914, Arz von Straussenburg requested a transfer to a field assignment and was again given command of the 15th infantry division, which participated in the closing stages of Komar\u00f3w. Almost immediately thereafter, on 7 September, Arz was given command of the 6th corps, taking over from Boroevi\u0107, who had been appointed to command the Third Army. In charge of the 6th Corps, he performed outstandingly and with great energy at Limanowa-Lapan\u00f3w, where his unit formed part of the 4th Army. At Gorlice-Tarn\u00f3w he was again to play an outstanding role and was in command again at Grodek-Magierow and Brest-litowsk during the summer of 1915. In September 1915, he was promoted to the rank of General der Infanterie, and having fought alongside Mackensen's 11th army he gained the respect of the Germans in his abilities as a commander.\n\nThe Romanian Campaign\n\nWith the threatened entry of Romania into the war on the Allied side, Arz was reassigned from the 6th Corps and appointed to command the newly reorganised 1st Army on 16 August 1916. Arriving at Kolozsv\u00e1r (today Cluj-Napoca, Romania), where forces were being marshalled to repel an expected Romanian advance into Transylvania, he stated \"I am an Army Commander without an Army\". Indeed, on the Romanian declaration of war on 27 August, the 1st 'Army' comprised a mere 10,000 men (half a division). A slow Romanian advance combined with hysterical outcry from Budapest led to the 1st Army being considerably and rapidly strengthened to drive back the challenge from the south.  \n\nRomanian forces crossed the frontier on 28 August 1916 with six separate forces pushing through the six Carpathian passes to converge on Brass\u00f3 (today Bra\u015fov, Romania). By 4 September they had succeeded in pushing nearly as far as Sepsiszentgy\u00f6rgy in the Sz\u00e9kely territories. In order to fend off these six separate invasions, Arz, now fighting on his home turf, ordered the 71st Infantry Division and 141st and 142nd Brigades to the sector. Simultaneously, the Romanian North Army sought to advance along the entire Moldavian front in the Eastern Carpathians, although in fact this amounted to an advance in the northern sector, where the Russian 9th Army was best placed to aid the advance. To counter this strike, Arz deployed the 16th, 19th and elements of the 61st divisions.\n\nIn cooperation with the German 9th Army, the Romanian invasion was repelled and its forces were thrown back across the border within eight weeks, leading to Arz receiving the respect and appreciation of the new Austro-Hungarian emperor, Karl I. Other commanders also hailed his achievements during the campaign, with Conrad writing that he had \"proved to be an energetic resolute leader in the most difficult situations...\" and Boroevi\u0107 stating that Arz was an \"Honourable, noble character....outstanding general.\"\n\nArz was to remain in charge of the 1st Army until February 1917, after major operations in Romania ended, with help from Falkenhayn 9th German Army and from the German Army of the Danube under Mackensen.\n\nChief of General Staff\n\nKarl I of Austria succeeded Franz Joseph as Emperor on 21 November 1916, bringing with him a wave of change across the upper echelons of the government and military command. One casualty of these changes was Conrad, with Karl reported as \"not wanting a genius to command his armies\", but following on from the experience of the supremely gifted but often unsuccessful Conrad, rather someone who was just capable. Arz was acquainted with the emperor; not only was he a capable commander of troops, but he also possessed a conciliatory manner which did not make the Emperor feel he was being patronised during discussions on military matters, as was the case with other commanders. Unlike Conrad, Arz was not overtly political, was wholly committed to the Central Powers, and had full faith in the Emperor.\n\nOnce appointed in March 1917, Arz made every effort to comply with the Emperor's wishes, but unlike his predecessor he acted as a personal advisor to the Emperor on army matters, rather than as a driver of his own strategy, which had been Conrad's hallmark. His tenure at the head of the army saw increasing German control over Austro-Hungarian forces and reduced independence of action, but also a number of notable victories in the spring and summer of 1917, including the clearing of Galicia and the Bukovina, as well as the breakthrough at Flitsch Tolmein and the great victory at Caporetto later in the year.\n\nPromoted to the rank of Generaloberst on 26 February 1918, and also raised to the nobility early the same year, Arz was ultimately responsible for planning the invasion of Italy which was to take place during the summer of 1918, with Russia now knocked out of the war and a good number of experienced forces at his disposal. While planning was underway, both Conrad and Boroevi\u0107 demanded to lead the offensive, and neither Arz nor the AOK was able to make a decisive decision. Instead a compromise suggested by the Emperor was adopted, with their forces divided and sent to attack Italian positions on the front from two different directions. This resulted in the utter failure of the offensive at the Piave River in June 1918.\n\nArz took full responsibility for the failure of the massive invasion of Italy and tendered his resignation, but the Emperor refused to accept it, even after Generaloberst Sch\u00f6nburg-Hartenstein had said to the Emperor's face that the army had lost all confidence in Arz. By late October 1918, Arz could see that ultimate defeat for the Imperial forces was inevitable. He had drawn up plans for an orderly troop withdrawal in the event of an armistice, so as to prevent unnecessary further bloodshed. An armistice with Italy was concluded on 3 November 1918 and was to come into effect 36 hours later, during which time thousands of Imperial troops were captured while believing themselves to be at peace, due to poor communication from Army High Command.\n\nEnd of the war\nDuring the night of 2\u20133 November 1918, the Emperor relinquished command of the armed forces. In a handwritten note which can still be found in the Vienna war archives, he wrote:\n\nNot wanting responsibility for handling the armistice, Arz declined the appointment, and K\u00f6vess took up appointment as commander-in-chief instead. Arz however undertook the position de facto until Field Marshal K\u00f6vess could take up his office.\n\nAfter the war\n\nAfter the collapse, Arz moved to in Vienna. He was granted a civil list pension of 20 000 Krone, but because of the growing inflation and anyway being not wealthy he had soon a very bad financial situation. Moreover, he became a scapegoat by the public opinion since next to the resigned King the Chief of the General Staff was made responsible for the consequences of the armistice and the defeat of the Battle of Piave. The newly established First Austrian Republic in spite of a new law accepted on 19 December 1918 conducted an infringement procedure against him regarding the Battle of Piave, however it ended without any result.\n\nWith Transylvania and the Bukovina awarded to Romania after the war, he became a Romanian citizen but he refused to return to his home in a country in the defeat of which he had played a significant role only a few years earlier, having expected of possible retaliation. Despite, since January 1921 the Romanian state granted his pension until 1923 when because of the intervention of Ion I. C. Br\u0103tianu the Romanian legislation voted a new law which denied the pension to those former Imperial and Royal military personnel officially resident in Transylvania, Banat and Bukovina who were not living in Romania.\n\nAs living in poverty, he applied - as well in the name of 72 fellow officer - to the Hungarian Prime Istv\u00e1n Bethlen, who denied his submission. He survived on stipends from a support fund organized by former Imperial and Royal comrades to help officers in such situations. In 1924 he was publishing his memoirs. In 1926, the Hungarian Government granted him a pension - ex post facto from 1 November 1925 -, after this the former support fund was transformed to the \"Funds of the former General Staff\". Since 1931, the Hungarian Parliament put a condition to all pensioner to be habitually residing in Budapest, in 1932, he moved officially to the city, however he did not check out from Vienna and continued to stay there recurrently.\n\nHe applied and was granted Hungarian citizenship in 1933.

He began his military service as a cadet in 1875, rising through the ranks to become General in 1916. His accomplishments during the war are impressive: he was the commander of the Austro-Hungarian 7th Army during the successful Battle of Gorlice-Tarnow. Under his leadership, the army pushed the Russians back, securing the Galician oil fields and forcing the Russians to abandon their defenses in Poland. As a result of his contributions to the war effort, he was awarded the title of Count. However, his reputation was tarnished due to his participation in the military occupation of Serbia, which was known for its atrocities, including mass killings. After the war, Arz von Strau\u00dfenburg served briefly as Chancellor of Austria in 1919, but was removed from the position after only one day due to his association with the failed Far Right coup attempt known as the Kapp Putsch in Germany. Despite his controversial past, Arz von Strau\u00dfenburg was considered a talented military strategist, earning him a place in history as one of the foremost leaders of the Austro-Hungarian Empire during the First World War. Arthur Arz von Strau\u00dfenburg died on 5 December 1935 in Vienna, Austria, at the age of 78.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Autopharmacology\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Autopharmacology relates to the scientific study of the regulation of body functions by the activity of its naturally existent (or endogenous) chemical factors of the tissues. A more restricted definition would consider substances that were first identified as external agents which had a documented action on physiological functions, but later were discovered as existing as endogenous factors. The best example is the class of endorphins, which, as its name implies, were discovered to exist in the brain and have specific receptors in it, by investigations on the mechanism of action of opioids, such as morphine.\n\nHistorically, the first approach to the concept of autopharmacology began with British physiologist and pharmacologist Henry Dale in the 1910s, discovered the role of acetylcholine in synaptic transmission, and later proved by Austrian physiologist Otto Loewi, to be the neurotransmitter involved in the proximal synapses of the autonomic nervous system (initially named Vagusstoff by Loewi, and later identified as acetylcholine). The same happened to another autonomic neurotransmitter, noradrenaline (Akzeleransstoff by Loewi), which later proved to be chemically similar to a long used pharmacological agent, adrenaline, a hormone secreted by the adrenal glands. Both scientists were awarded the 1936 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for their pioneering and important contributions.\n\nA research area where autopharmacology principles assumed great importance was that of pain and inflammation, due to the great number of endogenous messengers, transmitters and modulators involved in their complex response at molecular and cellular level. The control and regulation mechanisms of the circulatory system and renal functions and their interactions (such as the renin/angiotensin system) are also greatly influenced by autopharmacological agents; One of the autopharmacology pioneers was Professor Mauricio Rocha e Silva, leader of the team of Brazilian researchers who discovered bradykinin in 1948, an endogenous substance involved in hypotension in circulatory shock. Of course, all these systems are of extreme importance for clinical practice and for the discovery of new therapeutic drugs.\n\nEndogenous substances that could fall under the concept of autopharmacology are:\n\n Endorphins\n Dynorphin\n Bradykinin\n Prostaglandins\n Angiotensin\n Secretin\n Gastrin\n Cholecystokinin\n Histamine\n Cannabinoids\n Substance P\n\nThe main scientific criterion for an autopharmacological agent is the discovery of specific membrane receptors for it and, hopefully, its transduction and cell signaling mechanisms.\n\nThe term was never much of a mainstream concept, and has fallen into disuse, as research on basic mechanisms has advanced. In a recent literature search on PubMed, only six titles refer to the term autopharmacology.\n\nReferences\n\nPharmacology\nPhysiology", "machine_text": "Autopharmacology is a concept in the field of pharmacology that involves the use of drugs to regulate the cellular process of autophagy. Autophagy is a process by which cells break down and recycle their own components. It is a vital process that helps to maintain cellular homeostasis and plays an important role in many physiological processes. Autopharmacology seeks to develop drugs that can target the pathways involved in autophagy and thus modulate the process. The potential applications of autopharmacology are diverse as autophagy is implicated in a variety of diseases such as cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and infections. One of the most significant contributions of autopharmacology is in the development of cancer treatments. Many cancer cells rely on autophagy for their survival, and autophagy inhibition has been shown to be an effective strategy in inducing cancer cell death. The use of autophagy inhibitors in combination with other therapies such as chemotherapy has shown promising results in preclinical studies. Additionally, autophagy has been implicated in a number of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Autophagic dysfunction is thought to play a role in the accumulation of toxic protein aggregates that are characteristic of these diseases. The use of autophagy-inducing drugs may play a role in preventing or reversing these disease processes. There is still much to be learned about the complex pathways involved in autophagy, and research in autopharmacology continues to evolve. Advances in this field may lead to the development of novel therapeutics for a wide range of diseases.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 35484901}

It has been used as a football ground since 1930, however the first stand (the small east one) was not constructed until the mid-'50s. The main west stand was built in the 1970s. Unfortunately, in the years that followed, little else happened to the stadium, which gradually fell into disrepair. This was the situation until 2005, when the new owners of the club revealed their plans for the complete reconstruction of the stadium.

The DCPU-16 could also load external programs and data using the required standards which would have allowed the community to make their own DCPU-16 emulators.\n\nDevelopment\nIn December 2011, Markus Persson announced that he was going to be stepping down as the lead developer of Minecraft, and that he would be working on another project.  Mojang CEO Carl Manneh said in an interview with Edge Online that Mojang was committed to supporting a new project that Persson was developing along with another game created by other developers in their company. After winning a special award from BAFTA in March 2012, Persson revealed that there were three different projects he was developing, but he had yet to come to a decision in terms of which one he was committed to working on.  A few days later in an interview with PC Gamer magazine, Persson announced that he was working on a space-themed game that was inspired by the television show Firefly and the video game Elite.\n\nThe first details of this game were released in an April Fool's parody website called \"Mars Effect\", a play on Mass Effect and alluding to the lawsuit by Bethesda Softworks over trademark infringement. A few days later Persson announced that he had chosen a real name for the game and that he had made some progress on its development. Although it is not immediately obvious how to pronounce the game's name and a large variety of suggestions were proposed, Persson has said that he pronounces it as \"ten to the see,\" but that \"people can pronounce it however they want\".\n\nOn October 13, 2012, the first video gameplay of 0x10c was released by Persson on the game's website. On October 26, 2012, the first multiplayer test was uploaded to the website from Twitch.TV. In an April 2013 interview with Polygon, Persson stated that 0x10c development was hit by creative road block and would be put on hold. Persson also said that the game is \"ways off\" and that he would be expanding the team, bringing on one other developer to \"make sure the game gets made.\" On August 13, 2013, Persson confirmed in a live stream that 0x10c was indefinitely shelved, adding that the game could potentially be made in the future, if another Mojang employee were interested in continuing its development.\n\nArt \n\n\"The style is pixel art meets modern 3D.

Persson said that this was because of the cost to \"emulate all computers and physics even when players aren't logged in.\" It is unknown if there was to be a private multiplayer mode.

The game was announced in April 2012 and was expected to be released in late 2013 or early 2014. However, the development was eventually halted, and the game was never completed or released. The game's name, 0x10c, was derived from a hexadecimal number (16 in decimal) and the concept of a \"DCPU-16\", or a fictional 16-bit CPU which would be the central processing unit of the game's spacecraft. The game's storyline involved the idea that in the year 281,474,976,712,644 AD, the universe suffered a catastrophic event called \"The Great Disaster\". The players' task was to navigate through this new and unfamiliar universe, explore planets, and trade with other players. One of the game's unique features was the \"real-time\" nature of the game. Unlike other games where time advancements only occur in response to player actions or during cutscenes, time in 0x10c would continue to pass even when the player was not logged into the game. This means that while a player was away, their spacecraft would continue on its route, and any disasters or events that occurred during that time would be waiting for them upon their return. Unfortunately, due to the difficulties in developing the custom-designed DCPU-16 CPU and the lack of funding, the development of 0x10c was eventually stopped. Markus Persson cited a lack of motivation and interest in the project as the primary reasons for the game's cancellation. Despite the game's cancelation, the community still holds a significant level of interest in 0x10c, with some fans even attempting to create their version of the game using Notch's design documents and ideas.

He is a retired Pennsylvania Army National Guard brigadier general. In November 2021, Perry was elected chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, the most conservative group among U.S. House Republicans.\n\nOn December 20, 2021, the House panel investigating the January 6 Capitol attack called for an interview with Perry \u2013 the first time it publicly sought to question a sitting member of Congress. Perry emphatically declined the request the next day. The panel's chairperson said it had evidence from several witnesses that Perry had \"an important role\" in efforts to install Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark as acting attorney general.\n\nEarly life and education\nPerry was born in San Diego, California. His family moved to Dillsburg, Pennsylvania, a suburb of York, when he was seven. In 1980, he graduated from Northern High School in Dillsburg and Cumberland-Perry Vo-Tech School in York County, Pennsylvania. In 1991, Perry obtained a B.S. in business administration and management from Pennsylvania State University. In July 2012, he received a master's degree in strategic planning from the United States Army War College.\n\nMilitary service\n\nArmy National Guard\nPerry began his military career in 1980 when he enlisted in the Pennsylvania Army National Guard. He attended basic training at Fort Dix, New Jersey, and graduated from Advanced Individual Training at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, as a technical drafting specialist. He graduated from Pennsylvania's Officer Candidate School and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Field Artillery.\n\nAfter receiving his commission, Perry qualified as a helicopter pilot in the Aviation branch. He served in a variety of staff and command assignments as he advanced through the ranks, including executive officer of 1st Squadron, 104th Cavalry Regiment during deployment to Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2002\u20133, and commander of 2nd Battalion (General Support), 104th Aviation Regiment beginning in 2008.\n\nIraq war\nIn 2009\u201310, Perry commanded 2nd Battalion, 104th Aviation Regiment during its pre-deployment training and service in Iraq for Operation Iraqi Freedom. As Task Force Diablo, 2-104th Aviation was credited with flying 1,400 missions, accruing over 13,000 combat flight hours, and transporting over 3 million pounds of cargo and 43,000 soldiers and civilians. Perry was credited with flying 44 missions and accrued nearly 200 combat flight hours.\n\nPost-Iraq\n\nAfter returning from Iraq, Perry was promoted to colonel and assigned to command the Pennsylvania National Guard's 166th Regiment (Regional Training Institute) (2010\u201312). From 2012 to 2014, he commanded the garrison at the Fort Indiantown Gap National Training Center. In May 2014, Perry was assigned as one of the assistant division commanders of the 28th Infantry Division, and he was promoted to brigadier general in November 2015. In May 2016, he was assigned as assistant adjutant general for Army at the Pennsylvania National Guard's Joint Force Headquarters. Perry retired from the Pennsylvania National Guard on March 1, 2019.\n\nBusiness career\nIn 1993, Perry founded Hydrotech Mechanical Services, Inc., a mechanical contracting firm in Dillsburg. The firm provides contract construction and maintenance services to municipal and investor-owned utilities from North Carolina to New York, specializing in large meter calibration. In 2002, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection accused the company of altering sewage monitoring reports while doing work for the Memphord Estates Sewage Treatment Company. Perry faced criminal charges of conspiring to falsify state-mandated sewage records. In the aftermath of the investigation and review, he was allowed to complete a diversion program and avoid any criminal charges, which allowed him to maintain his U.S security clearance.\n\nPennsylvania House of Representatives\n\nElections\nIn 2006, state representative Bruce Smith of Pennsylvania's 92nd House district decided to retire. Perry won the Republican primary with 41% of the vote. He won the general election with 71% of the vote, and took office on January 2, 2007. In 2008, Perry was reelected to a second term unopposed. In 2010, he was reelected to a third term unopposed.\n\nCommittee assignments\n\nU.S. House of Representatives\n\nElections\n\n2012\n\nIn 2012, Perry gave up his state house seat to run for the 4th congressional district. The district had previously been the 19th district, represented by six-term incumbent Republican Todd Platts, who was giving up the seat to honor a self-imposed term limit. In 2010, when Platts wanted to become U.S. Comptroller General, he spoke to Perry about running for the seat.\n\nPerry won a seven-way primary with over 50% of the vote. Although outspent nearly 2 to 1 in the campaign, he beat his closest competitor with nearly three times as many votes. Political newcomer Harry Perkinson, an engineer, advanced in a two-way Democratic primary. Perry won the general election, 60%\u201334%.\n\n2014\n\nIn 2014, Perry was unopposed in the Republican primary and the former Harrisburg mayor, Linda D. Thompson, was unopposed in the Democratic primary. Perry won the general election, 75%\u201325%.\n\n2016\n\nPerry won the 2016 election with no primary challenge and no official Democratic opponent. Joshua Burkholder of Harrisburg, a political novice, withdrew from the Democratic primary after too many signatures on his qualifying petition were successfully challenged. His subsequent write-in candidacy won the Democratic primary, but he was unaffiliated in the general election. Perry defeated Burkholder, 66%\u201334%.\n\n2018\n\nAfter ruling the state's congressional map an unconstitutional gerrymander, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court issued a new map for the 2018 elections. Perry's district was renumbered the 10th and made significantly more compact than its predecessor. It lost most of the more rural and Republican areas of York County to the neighboring 11th district (the old 16th). To make up for the loss in population, it was pushed slightly to the north, absorbing the remainder of Democratic-leaning Dauphin County that had not been in the old 4th. On paper, the new district was less Republican than its predecessor. Had the district existed in 2016, Donald Trump would have won it with 52% of the vote to Hillary Clinton's 43%; Trump carried the old 4th with 58% of the vote.\n\nPastor and Army veteran George Scott won the Democratic primary by a narrow margin and opposed Perry in the general election for the reconfigured 10th. The two debated in October before Perry won with 51.3% of the vote to Scott's 48.7%, with the new district boundaries taking effect in 2019. Perry held on by winning the district's share of his home county, York County, by 11,600 votes. This was the district's closest race since 1974, when Bill Goodling won his first term in what was then the 19th with 51% of the vote.\n\n2020\n\nIn 2020, Perry had no Republican primary challenge, and the Pennsylvania auditor general, Eugene DePasquale, won a two-way Democratic primary. Perry was reelected with 53% of the vote in the general election.\n\nTenure\nPerry is a member of the Freedom Caucus. In November 2021, he was elected to chair the group, succeeding Andy Biggs in January 2022.\n\nIn October 2017, in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, Perry accused CNN anchor Chris Cuomo of exaggerating the crisis in Puerto Rico.\n\nIn January 2018, Perry suggested that ISIS might have been involved in the 2017 Las Vegas shooting. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack, but authorities have maintained that gunman Stephen Paddock acted alone.\n\nIn December 2019, Perry was one of 195 Republicans to vote against both articles of impeachment against President Trump.\n\nIn October 2020, Perry was one of 17 Republicans to vote against a House resolution to formally condemn the QAnon conspiracy theory. He said he voted against the resolution because he was concerned about infringements on free speech, saying, \"it's very dangerous for the government ... to determine what is okay to like and what is not okay to like.\"\n\nIn March 2021, Perry voted against the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. He said only 9% of the act's spending was allotted to defeat the COVID-19 virus, while the rest would advance Democratic policies.\n\nIn April 2021, at a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee meeting on immigration, Perry said, \"For many Americans, what seems to be happening or what they believe right now is happening is, what appears to them is we're replacing national-born American\u2014native-born Americans to permanently transform the political landscape of this very nation.\"\n\nIn June 2021, Perry was one of 21 House Republicans to vote against a resolution to give the Congressional Gold Medal to police officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on January 6. He cosponsored a bill, introduced the same day, that would give the same medal to police officers without mentioning the attack.\n\nAt the June 2021 Republican Pennsylvania Leadership Conference, Perry said Democrats \"are not the loyal opposition. They are the opposition to everything you love and believe in\" and \"want to destroy the country you grew up in\", invoking comparisons to Nazis.\n\nForeign policy\nIn 2020, Perry voted against the National Defense Authorization Act of 2021, which in part would prevent the president from withdrawing soldiers from Afghanistan without congressional approval.\n\nIn March 2021, Perry was one of 14 House Republicans to vote against a measure condemning the Myanmar coup d'\u00e9tat that overwhelmingly passed.\n\nIn July 2021, Perry voted against the bipartisan ALLIES Act, which would increase by 8,000 the number of special immigrant visas for Afghan allies of the U.S. military during its invasion of Afghanistan while also reducing some application requirements that caused long application backlogs; the bill passed in the House 407\u201316.\n\nImmigration\nPerry voted against the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020 which authorized DHS to nearly double the available H-2B visas for the remainder of FY 2020.\n\nPerry voted against the Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1158) which effectively prohibits ICE from cooperating with Health and Human Services to detain or remove illegal alien sponsors of unaccompanied alien children (UACs).\n\nInvolvement with 2020 presidential election\nAfter the 2020 general election, Perry promoted false claims of election fraud.\n\nIn December 2020, Perry was one of 126 Republican House members to sign an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated Trump.\n\nOn January 6, 2021, Perry joined Missouri senator Josh Hawley in objecting to counting Pennsylvania's electoral votes in the 2020 presidential election. During the storming of the U.S. Capitol that day, Perry and his congressional colleagues were ushered to a secure location.\n\nPerry reportedly played a role in a December 2020 crisis at the Justice Department in which Trump considered firing acting attorney general Jeffrey Rosen and replacing him with Jeffrey Clark, the acting chief of the civil division of the DOJ. The New York Times reported Perry introduced Clark to Trump because Clark's \"openness to conspiracy theories about election fraud presented Mr. Trump with a welcome change from the acting attorney general, Jeffrey A. Rosen, who stood by the results of the election and had repeatedly resisted the president's efforts to undo them.\" Before the certification of the electoral college vote on January 6, Perry and Clark reportedly discussed a plan in which the Justice Department would send Georgia legislators a letter threatening an investigation into voter fraud and an invalidation of Georgia's electoral votes, even though the DOJ had investigated reports of fraud but found nothing significant, as attorney general Bill Barr had publicly announced weeks earlier. Clark drafted a letter to Georgia officials and presented it to Rosen and his deputy Richard Donoghue. It claimed the DOJ had \"identified significant concerns that may have impacted the outcome of the election in multiple States\" and urged the Georgia legislature to convene a special session for the \"purpose of considering issues pertaining to the appointment of Presidential Electors.\" Rosen and Donoghue rejected the proposal. In August 2021, CNN reported that Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe had briefed top Justice Department officials that no evidence had been found of any foreign powers' interference with voting machines. Clark was reportedly concerned that intelligence community analysts were withholding information and believed Perry and others knew more about possible foreign interference. Clark requested authorization from Rosen and Donoghue for another briefing from Ratcliffe, asserting hackers had found that \"a Dominion machine accessed the Internet through a smart thermostat with a net connection trail leading back to China.\"\n\nOn December 20, 2021, House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack chairman Bennie Thompson wrote to Perry asking him to provide information about his involvement in the effort to install Clark as acting attorney general. Thompson believed Perry had been involved in the effort to install Clark, given previous testimony from former acting attorney general Rosen and his deputy Donoghue, as well as communications between Perry and Meadows. Perry declined the request the next day, asserting the committee was illegitimate. Among several text messages to Meadows the committee released on December 14 was one attributed to a \"member of Congress\" dated January 5 that read \"Please check your signal,\" a reference to the encrypted messaging system Signal. In his letter to Perry, Thompson mentioned evidence that Perry had communicated with Meadows using Signal, though Perry denied sending that particular text message.\n\nCommittee assignments \n Committee on Foreign Affairs\n Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific and Nonproliferation\n Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations\n Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure\n Subcommittee on Aviation\n Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials\n\nCaucus memberships\n Freedom Caucus\nSecond Amendment Caucus\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Congressman Scott Perry official U.S. House website\n Scott Perry for Congress\n \n \n \n\n|-\n\n|-\n\n|-\n\n|-\n\n1962 births\n21st-century American politicians\nAmerican Master Army Aviators\nLiving people\nMembers of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives\nMembers of the United States House of Representatives from Pennsylvania\nMilitary personnel from California\nMilitary personnel from Pennsylvania\nNational Guard of the United States generals\nPennsylvania Republicans\nPennsylvania National Guard personnel\nSmeal College of Business alumni\nPeople from Cumberland County, Pennsylvania\nPeople from York County, Pennsylvania\nPoliticians from San Diego\nRecipients of the Meritorious Service Medal (United States)\nRepublican Party members of the United States House of Representatives\nUnited States Army generals\nUnited States Army War College alumni", "machine_text": "Scott Perry is an American politician who serves as the U.S. Representative for Pennsylvania's 10th congressional district.

The album features 15 tracks in total, including such classics as \"Don't Dream It's Over\", \"Message to My Girl\", and \"Four Seasons in One Day\". Each song has been given a fresh new twist through the contributions of a diverse range of musicians, including KT Tunstall, Linda Ronstadt, and Missy Higgins. The idea for the album originally came about when Finn was asked to participate in a charity concert in aid of Oxfam. He decided that he wanted to perform his songs with a female vocalist, and enlisted the help of his wife, Sharon, to find suitable candidates. The resulting project not only raised money for a good cause, but also became a commercial success in its own right, reaching the top 10 in the New Zealand album charts.

It is named after Swedish mathematician Axel Thure Palm and Russian mathematician Aleksandr Khintchine, who independently derived the result in the early 20th century. The theorem states that for a stationary stochastic process X(t), the spatial intensity function of its point process is proportional to the autocorrelation function of the process evaluated at the origin. In simple terms, the intensity of the point process is related to the correlation between the values of the process at different times. The Palm\u2013Khintchine theorem has wide-ranging implications in various areas of science and engineering. For example, it is used in queuing theory to model the arrival of customers at a service facility, in telecommunications to analyze the interference of wireless signals, and in finance to study the clustering of stock returns. The theorem has also led to the development of various statistical models for point processes, such as the Poisson point process, the Cox process, and the shot noise process. These models have proved to be very useful in modeling various real-world phenomena, such as traffic flow, earthquake occurrences, and neural spike trains. In summary, the Palm\u2013Khintchine theorem is a fundamental result in probability theory that relates the point process and the probability distribution of a stationary stochastic process. Its applications span a wide range of domains, from queuing theory to finance and neuroscience, and it has played a key role in the development of statistical models for point processes.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 27446088}

Adaptation is an essential function that allows organisms and societies to manage and survive changes in their environment. In biology, Adaptatsiya refers to the genetic, physiological, and behavioral changes that occur in a species over time to cope with changing environmental conditions. These changes can be the result of natural selection, mutation, or gene flow. For example, some animals adapt to their environment through camouflage and mimicry to protect themselves from predators. Some plants have developed drought-tolerant roots and leaves to thrive in arid conditions. In psychology, Adaptatsiya refers to the process of adjusting to new experiences and situations. This process may involve modifying one's behavior, attitudes, and beliefs to match the demands of a specific environment. For example, immigrants have to adapt to their new culture and language when they move to a foreign country. In sociology, Adaptatsiya refers to social adjustments and changes that individuals or groups make in response to changes in their social and cultural environment. This process may involve changes in social norms, values, and beliefs. For example, different cultures have different attitudes towards gender roles, family structures, and religion. In conclusion, Adaptatsiya is a crucial process that allows individuals, species, and societies to adapt and thrive in changing environments.

Born in Israel, Dr. Feldman received her undergraduate degree in psychology from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, before obtaining her Ph.D. in psychology from Bar Ilan University. She then went on to complete her postdoctoral training at Yale University's Child Study Center, where she began her groundbreaking work exploring how the human brain processes social information. Today, Dr. Feldman is a Professor of Developmental Social Neuroscience at the Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya in Israel, where she leads an interdisciplinary team of researchers who investigate the neural and behavioral underpinnings of social behavior in infants and adults. Her research has shown that early social experiences can have lasting effects on emotional and cognitive development, and that social interactions between parents and infants can shape the neural pathways that make up the social brain. In addition to her scientific contributions, Dr. Feldman is also a devoted mentor and teacher, who has trained numerous students and postdoctoral fellows in the fields of developmental psychology and social neuroscience. Her research has been widely published in prestigious scientific journals and has garnered numerous awards and honors, including the prestigious Alexander von Humboldt Foundation Award for Research Excellence, the American Psychological Association's Early Career Award, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science's Early Career Award for Public Engagement with Science.

In 1845 he was appointed to a clerical position, that of chaplain in Leikanger. In 1849 the district of Balestrand was separated from Leikanger as an own parish, and Sverdrup became vicar (sogneprest) of the new parish. He published several works, mostly based on Erik Pontoppidan's explanation of the Luther's Small Catechism.\n\nAs his brother, Harald Ulrik Sverdrup became involved in politics. When Balestrand became a municipality of its own in 1849, Sverdrup became its first mayor. He sat as mayor until 1879.

The crypt contains the remains of a fifth-century Roman basilica. The site was originally occupied by a Roman fort.\n\nA new church was built on the site in early in 717 by Duke Adalbert of Alsace, brother of Saint Odile, as part of a new convent, in which he installed his daughter Attala as the first abbess.\n\nThe Church also served for many years as the episcopal seat for the north of Alsace.\n\nThe church was rebuilt in 1220 in Romanesque-Gothic style.\n\nAt the beginning of the 16th century, St Stephen's was a parish church, the parish of Stephen's being one of the nine parishes of Strasbourg. In 1534, as the reform was being introduced in Strasbourg, the parish of St Stephen's was transferred to St William's, on account of the opposition of the cannonesses of St Stephen's to the new teaching.\n\nIn the seventeenth century Louis XIV closed the abbey and transferred it to the Visitandines to serve as a boarding school for young women, a function which continued up until the French Revolution. In 1714 the church was equipped with an organ by Andreas Silbermann, which is now in Bischheim. After the French Revolution, the building was used as a warehouse, then as a theatre. In 1802, the church was deprived of its tower and in 1805 this was transformed into a theatre.\n\nThe college, of which the church now forms part, began life in 1861 as a 'Petit seminaire' (literally 'little seminary'), educating future priests as well as lay students.\n\nAllied bombing destroyed much of the building in 1944. Only the wide transept with its triple apse survived. In 1956, the ancient site was excavated and a Merovingian apse was discovered beneath the foundations of the old tower. In 1961, the nave was renovated, exposing the timber structures. The church was classified as a historical monument in 1962.\n\nIn 2016, the monumental concert organ from the former conservatory located in the National Theatre of Strasbourg was moved into the nave in order to be used as a church organ. The instrument, a 1963 work by organ builder Curt Schwenkedel, had been out of use since 1995. It was entirely restored by Quentin Blumenroeder from Haguenau.\n\nAs the Church is now part of a school, public access is only possible on special occasions, such as European Heritage Days. The school owns some valuable historical tapestries from the abbey church, some of which can be seen in the nearby Notre Dame museum.\n\nExternal links \n\n Eglise Saint Etienne - 2 rue de la Pierre Large on archi-wiki.org \n website of the Saint-Etienne college\n Aerial photo on French historical monuments website\n\nReferences\n\nRoman Catholic churches in Strasbourg\nRoman Catholic chapels in France\nRoman sites in France\nRomanesque architecture in France\nMonuments historiques of Bas-Rhin", "machine_text": "Saint Stephen's Church, located in the city of Strasbourg in the eastern region of France, is a magnificent example of Gothic architecture constructed between the years of 1284 and 1439.

The Gothic style is reflected in the carefully crafted fa\u00e7ade, which features detailed glass windows and elaborate statues arranged in a gable design. The spire is made up of several tiers, each decorated with intricate lacework and gothic elements. The church also features a rose window, which is considered one of the finest examples of its kind in the world. Inside, the church is home to several notable pieces of artwork, including the striking altar that depicts the Passion of Christ and the magnificent Astronomical Clock which dates back to the sixteenth century. The clock features elaborate astronomical instruments and calendar displays, including zodiac imagery and the days of the week tailored to the astrological signs. In the nineteenth century, Saint Stephen's Church underwent significant restoration and expansion work. It was praised by the likes of Victor Hugo, the famous author and architect who described it as a \"gigantic and delicate marvel.\" Today, the church is considered one of the most beautiful examples of Gothic architecture in France and is open for worship, guided tours, and personal visits.

The election was marred by controversy, with many opposition groups calling for a boycott and accusations of voter intimidation and election fraud. The Islamic Republic Party, the ruling party at the time, won a majority of seats, taking 155 out of the 201 seats. The National Front, a secular opposition party, won 32 seats, while the Islamic Iran Participation Front, a reformist party, won only one seat. The election was notable for its low voter turnout, with only 28% of eligible voters participating. Opposition groups claimed that the low turnout was a result of voter intimidation and the lack of electoral transparency. The Islamic Republic Party, however, attributed the low turnout to the success of the revolution and the fact that many Iranians believed that their votes were unnecessary. The aftermath of the election saw increased political and social tensions in Iran. Many opposition groups, including the National Front and the Mojahedin-e Khalq, continued to call for a boycott of the political system. The Islamic Republic Party, meanwhile, consolidated its power, using the election results to justify its policies and suppress dissent. Despite the controversy surrounding the 1984 Iranian legislative election, it marked an important chapter in the history of the Islamic Republic of Iran. It was the first post-revolutionary election and served as a test of the Iranian political system's legitimacy.

Found primarily in the Mediterranean region, the mole cricket has a distinct physical appearance and distinctive way of life. Appearance: The mole cricket has a unique appearance that allows it to blend in with its surroundings. Its wings are reduced to small pads, which it uses for balance while burrowing. It has large, spade-like front legs with shovels on the ends that are used for digging. Its body is brown in color and covered in tiny hairs. Habitat and Life cycle: The mole cricket lives in a variety of soil types, but it prefers sandy soil where it can easily dig and burrow. They can be found in open fields, gardens, meadows, and even in vineyards. They feed on plants, roots, and invertebrates. The male mole crickets can be heard chirping during the breeding season. They produce a sound by rubbing their front wings together. The female lays about 60 eggs in underground tunnels, which hatch into tiny nymphs. The mole cricket undergoes incomplete metamorphosis, which means that they have three stages: egg, nymph, and adult. Role in the ecosystem: The mole cricket plays a significant role in the ecosystem's food chain. They are a source of food for birds and other animals, and they also help to aerate the soil, which promotes plant growth. However, they can also do significant damage to crops and gardens by uprooting plants and eating the roots. Conclusion: Overall, the mole cricket is an intriguing species that is fascinating in both appearance and behavior. While they can be a nuisance to gardeners and farmers, they also have played an essential role in maintaining balanced ecosystems for centuries.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 62159083}

He began his education at the Academy of Fine Arts in Rotterdam, where he was taught by Johannes Cornelis Hofstede and Hendrik van de Sande Bakhuyzen. Later, he became a student of Jean Augustin Daiwaille, a well-known Dutch landscape painter. Through his studies, Haanen developed his skills for painting romantic landscapes and gained a love for depicting the Dutch countryside. Casparis Haanen's paintings were filled with rich and detailed scenes of the Dutch countryside. He enjoyed depicting small town life and the people that lived in them. His paintings often showed people going about their daily business, tending to their animals, working in their gardens, or simply admiring the view. One of his most famous paintings is \"Returning from the Fields\" which depicts a woman and a child returning home from working in the fields. The painting is known for its serene and almost dream-like quality, as well as its beautiful depiction of the Dutch countryside. Casparis Haanen continued to paint throughout his life, and his works are considered some of the most important of the Dutch Romantic period. His paintings can be found in many museums and private collections throughout the world, including the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. Haanen's influence as a painter has been felt not only in the Netherlands but in other parts of the world as well. His portrayal of rural life and landscapes has inspired other painters to look to nature for inspiration, and to capture the beauty of the Dutch countryside on canvas. Despite being overshadowed by his more famous brother, Charles Fran\u00e7ois Haanen, Casparis Haanen's contribution to the world of fine art cannot be overstated.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Creamy layer\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Creamy layer is a term used in Indian politics to refer to some members of a backward class who are highly advanced socially as well as economically and educationally. They constitute the forward section of that particular backward class \u2013 as forward as any other forward class member. They are not eligible for government-sponsored educational and professional benefit programs. The term was introduced by the Sattanathan Commission in 1971, which directed that the \"creamy layer\" should be excluded from the reservations (quotas) of civil posts. It was also identified later by Justice Ram Nandan Committee in 1993.\n\nThe creamy layer (income) criteria were defined as gross annual income of parents from all sources more than 100,000 rupees (\u20b9 or INR defined by Sattanathan committee in 1971) In 1993 when \"creamy layer\" ceiling was introduced, it was \u20b9 1 lakh. It was subsequently revised to Rs 2.5 lakh per annum in (2004), and revised to  \u20b9 4.5 lakh (2008), Rs 6 lakh (2013) and Rs 8 lakh (2017). In October 2015, the National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC) proposed that a person belonging to Other Backward Class (OBC) with gross annual income of parents up to Rs 15 lakh should be considered as the minimum ceiling for OBC. The NCBC also recommended the sub-division of OBCs into \"backward\", \"more backward\", and \"extremely backward\" blocs and divide 27% quota amongst them in proportion to their population, to ensure that stronger OBCs don't corner the quota benefits.\n\nClassification\nThe Supreme Court of India defined the \"creamy layer\", quoting an Indian governmental office memorandum dated 8 September 1993. The term was originally introduced in the context of reservation of jobs for certain groups in Indra Sawhney & Others v. Union of India case in 1992. The Supreme Court has said that the benefit of reservation should not be given to OBC children of constitutional functionaries\u2014such as the President, Judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts, employees of central and state bureaucracies above a certain level, public sector employees, and members of the armed forces and paramilitary personnel above the rank of colonel.  Those from scheduled castes (SCs) and in scheduled tribes (STs) are exempt from this classification, and always receive the benefits of reservation regardless of family income. Those not from preferred groups do not now receive the benefit of reservation regardless of how low the family income.\n\nThe children of persons engaged in trade, industry and professions such as a doctor, lawyer, chartered accountant, income tax consultant, financial or management consultant, dental surgeon, engineer, computer specialist, film artists and other film professional, author, playwright, sports person, sports professional, media professional or any other vocations of like status whose annual income is more than \u20b9 800,000 (Rs 8 lakh) for a period of three consecutive years are also excluded. [OBC children belong to any family earning a total gross annual income (from sources other than salary and agricultural land) of less than Rs 6 lakh for a period of three consecutive year\u2014as the 1993 income ceiling for the creamy layer was raised from \u20b9 100,000 (Rs 1 lakh, when the office memo was accepted) to Rs 6 lakh for a period of three consecutive years (in May 2013). Individuals belonging to the creamy layer are also excluded from being categorised as \"socially and educationally backward\" regardless of their social/educational backwardness.\n\nApplication on SC/ST quota\nThe 'creamy layer' categorization was meant only for the OBCs until 30 September 2018 but now are also applied to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, it was argued that it is not on economic basis rather on the basis of untouchability or backwardness. This applied only in reservations in promotion and rest remain the same. In December 2019, the central govt has appealed in Surpeme court against the previous order of applicability of creamy layer to the SC/ST quota.\n\nSee also\n Caste system in India\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n http://www.ncbc.nic.in/Writereaddata/dopteng.pdf\n Jee IITM Information.\n National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC) government website.\n\nReservation in India\nCaste system in India\nOther Backward Classes", "machine_text": "Creamy Layer is a term commonly used in India to describe a subsection of the OBC (Other Backward Castes) community that is considered economically advanced or socially advanced, and therefore not entitled to reservations under affirmative action policies for education and employment opportunities. The term creamy layer was first introduced in the case of Indra Sawhney v. Union of India (1992), also called the Mandal case, where the Supreme Court ruled that reservations should only be given to the socially and economically deprived sections of the OBC community. The ruling stated that the creamy layer of the community (those who were already economically and socially advanced) should not be entitled to reservations. The creamy layer is determined by the government's annual income criteria, which have been revised periodically. Those who earn more than the specified income limit set by the government are considered part of the creamy layer and are not eligible for reservations. The concept of the creamy layer prevents economically stable individuals from using reservations for their personal gain, while allowing members of the OBC community who are truly disadvantaged to benefit from affirmative action policies. The reservation system in India, including the concept of the creamy layer, is aimed at promoting social equality and inclusivity. The creamy layer concept has also been extended to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, who were historically oppressed communities in India. The Supreme Court has stated that the creamy layer concept is equally applicable to them as well. Overall, the creamy layer concept is an essential part of India's affirmative action policies and plays a significant role in ensuring that reservations for education and employment opportunities are provided to those who are genuinely deprived and in need of social upliftment.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 8345406}

She is the first woman and first openly gay person to hold the office.\n\nShe entered government as the minister of public administration and local self-government from 11 August 2016 until 29 June 2017, under Prime Minister Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107 and Acting Prime Minister Ivica Da\u010di\u0107. In this role, Brnabi\u0107 initiated reforms of central government services in Serbia.\n\nAfter he was inaugurated as the president of Serbia on 31 May 2017, Vu\u010di\u0107 proposed Brnabi\u0107 as his successor in June 2017. Prime Minister Brnabi\u0107 and her cabinet were voted into office on 29 June 2017 by a majority of 157 out of 250 Members of the National Assembly of Serbia. Elected as a non-partisan politician, she joined the ruling Serbian Progressive Party in 2019, and was subsequently elected as vice president in 2021.\n\nIn 2019, Brnabi\u0107 was ranked by Forbes magazine as the 88th most powerful woman in the world and as the 19th most powerful female political and policy leader. Some observers believe that she has no political power in line with the constitutional role of chief of the executive, arguing instead that Vu\u010di\u0107 wields power in his capacity as the president.\n\nEarly and personal life\nBrnabi\u0107 was born in Belgrade. Her paternal grandfather Anton Brnabi\u0107, an ethnic Croat Yugoslav military officer, was born in Stara Ba\u0161ka on the Croatian island of Krk in Croatia. He fought with the Yugoslav Partisans during World War II and was ranked lieutenant colonel after the war. Her paternal grandmother Mica was born in Gorobilje near Po\u017eega. Her maternal grandparents are from Babu\u0161nica, southeastern Serbia. Her father Zoran was born in U\u017eice in 1950 and finished his studies in Belgrade, where the family lived.\n\nBrnabi\u0107 is a lesbian, the second female LGBT head of government in the world following J\u00f3hanna Sigur\u00f0ard\u00f3ttir (Iceland 2009\u201313), and fifth openly LGBT head of government overall following , Elio Di Rupo (Belgium 2011\u201314), Xavier Bettel (Luxembourg 2013\u2013present), and Leo Varadkar (Ireland 2017\u201320).  In 2017, she became the first head of government of any Balkan country to attend a gay pride march when she attended one in Belgrade.\n\nIn 2019, her partner Milica \u0110ur\u0111i\u0107 gave birth to a boy; Brnabi\u0107 is the first openly gay prime minister whose partner gave birth while the prime minister was in office.\n\nEducation and business career\nBrnabi\u0107 was raised in Belgrade, Serbia, where she attended the prestigious Belgrade Fifth Gymnasium. In addition to her Serbian education, Brnabi\u0107 holds a Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) diploma of Northwood University, Michigan, USA, and an MBA of the University of Hull, England, UK, and worked for over a decade with international organizations, foreign investors, local self-government units, and the public sector in Serbia.\n\nPrior to Brnabi\u0107's appointment to the Government of Serbia, she was director of Continental Wind Serbia, where she worked on the implementation of the investment of \u20ac300 million into a windpark in Kovin. She was a member of the managing board of the non-profit foundation Peksim.\n\nShe has been engaged in different US consulting companies that implemented USAID-financed projects in Serbia. She was deputy manager of the Serbia Competitiveness Project, the expert on the Local Self-government Reform Program in Serbia and the senior coordinator of the Program of Economic Development of Municipalities. She was active in the foundation of the National Alliance for Local Economic Development (NALED) in 2006. During that engagement, she participated in the introduction of the concept of local economic development in Serbia and building of potentials of municipalities to improve the business environment at the local level with active promotion of investments. She became a member, and thereafter the president, of the managing board of NALED.\n\nPolitics\n\nIn August 2016, she was appointed as the Minister of Public Administration and Local Self-Government. In addition, she is the president of the Council for Innovative Entrepreneurship and Information Technologies of the Government of Serbia, as well as of the Republic Council for National Minorities and the vice president of the Republic Council for Public Administration Reform.\n\nBrnabi\u0107 described herself as a pro-European and technocratic prime minister. She explained that the priorities for her government are modernization, education reform and digitization. On the other hand, she has been criticised because she is the head of a conservative and nationalist government which also includes openly anti-Western and pro-Russian ministers.\n\nIn May 2018, Brnabi\u0107 took over the Ministry of Finance until the new Minister was appointed, following the resignation of Du\u0161an Vujovi\u0107. On 29 May 2018, she appointed Sini\u0161a Mali as Vujovi\u0107's successor on that position. On 26 July 2018, Brnabi\u0107 hosted a ceremony at the United States Congress in Washington, which was held to mark the 100th anniversary of raising the Serbian flag in front of the White House.\n\nIn October 2019, the Prime Minister confirmed she had joined the ruling Serbian Progressive Party. On 25 October 2019, Brnabi\u0107 signed a Free Trade Agreement between Serbia and the member states of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), extending the list of Serbian products that can be exported to the EAEU territory.\n\nAfter the COVID-19 pandemic spread to Serbia in March 2020, Brnabi\u0107 was appointed for the head of the Health Crisis Committee. After president Vu\u010di\u0107 declared a state of emergency on 15 March, the government issued regulations on measures during a state of emergency with the aim of suppressing the consequences of the outbreak. A curfew was introduced for the first time in Serbia since World War II. Brnabi\u0107 was elected as vice president of SNS in November 2021.\n\nDebate on constitutional roles\nPolitical scientists Krzysztof Zuba listed Brnabi\u0107 as an example of the head of government with extensive political dependence on a leader of the governing party. He defined a situation in which the Prime Minister does not have their own political position as the chief of the executive as a \u201csurrogate government\u201d, explaining that a distribution of power that is contrary to constitutional determinants is a characteristic of non-democratic systems.\n\nIn February 2019, Freedom House reported that Serbia's status declined from Free to Partly Free due to deterioration in the conduct of elections, continued attempts by the government and allied media outlets to undermine independent journalists through legal harassment and smear campaigns, and Vu\u010di\u0107's accumulation of executive powers that conflict with his constitutional role. Opposition leaders and some observers describe her as a mere puppet of Vu\u010di\u0107, whose presidency, according to the Constitution, is largely ceremonial with no significant executive power. Brnabi\u0107 never denied this, and even said that Vu\u010di\u0107 should act as a \"mentor\" of the prime minister.\n\nKosovo\n\nIn December 2018, commenting on the announced transformation of the Kosovo Security Force into the Kosovo Armed Forces, Brnabi\u0107 said: \"I hope we won\u2019t have to use our military, but at the moment, that\u2019s one of the options on the table because one cannot witness a new ethnic cleansing of the Serbs and new Storms \u2014 although Edi Rama is calling for them. When someone knows you have a strong army, then they have to sit down and talk to you.\"\n\nIn addition, in May 2019, Foreign Minister of Kosovo Behgjet Pacolli said that he would not allow Brnabi\u0107 to enter Kosovo because of what he said is her racist ideology. Brnabi\u0107, during the handover of a European Commission 2019 progress report, said: \"Haradinaj, Tha\u00e7i and Veseli are competing to see who the biggest nationalist and chauvinist is. What scares me most is that we are dealing with irrational people, the worst kind of populist, people who literally walked out of the woods.\" This was met with strong criticism, particularly by Twitter users, who campaigned with the hashtag #literallyjustemergedfromthewoods in order to mock the Prime Minister.\n\nOn 20 January 2020, the governments of Serbia and Kosovo agreed to restore flights between their capitals for the first time in more than two decades. The deal came after months of diplomatic talks by Richard Grenell, the United States ambassador to Germany, who was named special envoy for Serbian-Kosovar relations by President Donald Trump the year before.\n\nSrebrenica genocide remarks\nIn an interview on 14 November 2018 with the German public broadcaster Deutsche Welle, Brnabi\u0107 denied that the July 1995 massacres of Bosniaks by Bosnian Serb forces in Srebrenica had been an act of genocide. Two weeks later, the European Parliament adopted a resolution saying that the parliament regretted the continuing denial of the Srebrenica genocide by parts of the Serbian authorities and recalled that full cooperation with the ICTY and its successor mechanism included accepting its judgements. The Hague Court criticised Brnabi\u0107 for denial of the Srebenica genocide.\n\nLGBT rights\n\nAfter she was appointed prime minister, Brnabi\u0107 said that she did not want to be branded Serbia's gay prime minister and that she did not plan \"to push LGBT legal reforms at this stage\" because she wanted to prioritise other policy reforms. In September 2017, Brnabi\u0107 took part in the pride parade in Belgrade and became the first Serbian prime minister to attend a pride parade. At the event, Brnabi\u0107 said:\n\nBrnabi\u0107 says that she advocates inheritance rights of same-sex couples. In February 2019, Milica \u0110ur\u0111i\u0107, Brnabi\u0107's partner, gave birth to a son named Igor, but same-sex marriage is constitutionally banned and LGBT parenting is not regulated in Serbia. According to Agence France-Presse, \"Ana Brnabi\u0107 is one of the first prime ministers whose partner has given birth while in office... and the first in the world in a same-sex couple\". Some journalists and LGBT activists have concluded that Brnabi\u0107 has failed to advocate for LGBT equality in Serbia.\n\nAwards\nShe has been awarded a number of plaudits for the development projects on which she worked, for the promotion of socially accountable business operation and tolerance. She has been awarded the Order of the Republika Srpska.\n\nSee also\n Prime Minister of Serbia\n Cabinet of Ana Brnabi\u0107\n Second cabinet of Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107\n List of elected and appointed female heads of state and government\n List of the first LGBT holders of political offices\n List of openly LGBT heads of government\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Prime Minister of Serbia \n \n\n|-\n\n|-\n\n1975 births\nLiving people\n21st-century Serbian women politicians\nAlumni of the University of Hull\nFemale heads of government\nLesbian politicians\nLGBT heads of government\nLGBT people from Serbia\nNorthwood University alumni\nPoliticians from Belgrade\nPrime Ministers of Serbia\nSerbian people of Croatian descent\nWomen government ministers of Serbia\nWomen prime ministers\n21st-century LGBT people", "machine_text": "Ana Brnabi\u0107 is a prominent Serbian politician who currently serves as the Prime Minister of Serbia, making her the first openly gay head of government in a conservative country.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 21, 2010. In this episode, Bart falls in love with a girl named Nikki from a second fourth-grade class, but when he kisses her, Nikki begins treating Bart like dirt. Meanwhile, First Lady Michelle Obama teaches Lisa that there is no shame in being an overachiever, and Nelson Muntz teaches a blind boy how to be a schoolyard bully.\n\nThe episode was written by John Frink and directed by Steven Dean Moore.\n\nThe episode was also watched by 5.69 million households and received a 2.8/8 in the 18-49 Nielsen Rating.\n\nThe episode received mixed reviews from critics. The episode guest stars Sarah Silverman as Nikki and Angela Bassett as Michelle Obama.\n\nPlot\nBart's fourth-grade class is merged with another fourth-grade class when teacher Mrs. Krabappel is absent. In the crowded classroom, Bart is forced to sit by a new student named Nikki. At first, they dislike each other, until Nikki admires Bart's artistic skills. Bart seeks romance advice from Homer, who passes him off to Grandpa Abe. After Grandpa advises Bart to kiss Nikki, however, when Bart does so after the two skateboard together, she recoils in disgust. Nikki's attorney's parents threaten to sue the school unless it is declared an \"affection-free environment\". Superintendent Chalmers causes a play in which Willie plays Nikki and Skinner plays Bart who was strangled by Homer after calling him a \u201cFatso\u201d, meaning they are forced to kiss. Bart is confused at the outcome of this seemingly innocent action, and his confusion is later amplified when Nikki hides in his locker and kisses him again.\n\nMeanwhile, Lisa becomes popular when she receives an F on a test, but becomes unpopular again when it is revealed that her test was mistakenly given to Ralph, as both tests were mixed up as the F grade was supposed to be given to Ralph who had written Lisa's name on his test. Angry about being ostracized for being an overachiever once again, Lisa blogs about it, and her post is noted by a mysterious blogger known as Flotus 1 who turns out to be First Lady Michelle Obama. Obama drops by Springfield Elementary to give a speech about the importance of academics and recommends that the students should be nice to Lisa and other overachievers like her friends, Martin Prince and Allison Taylor.\n\nBart and Nikki have been watching this speech from the roof, and Bart confesses to Nikki he does not understand her ever-changing moods. They argue and Bart stumbles, falling off the roof. Nikki says \"I love you,\" but seeing that Bart is breathing treats him badly again. Bart stops breathing again, but the school's \"no-touch\" policy prevents anyone from performing CPR. Nikki defies the policy and revives Bart via mouth-to-mouth, thus setting off a montage of kiss scenes from various movies, some of which (such as Alien 3) never even had kiss scenes in them. When Bart awakes, Nikki's mood changes yet again and Bart remains in a state of complete confusion over female behavior. He tells her he does not care what happens between her and him, but then changes his mind and yells out \"I love you!\" after she kisses him once again.\n\nThroughout the episode, Nelson Muntz has befriended a blind boy and teaches him how to laugh at the misfortunes of others. In the end, the blind boy tricks Nelson into believing that a punch he sustained after insulting Nelson restored his sight. When he reveals to Nelson that this was a prank and laughs at Nelson's signature \"haw haw\", Nelson is as impressed as he is touched by the achievement.\n\nProduction\nThe episode is written by John Frink and directed by Steven Dean Moore, his second director credit for the season after \"O Brother, Where Bart Thou?\".

Brooks told  Variety that the crew had been \"aggressive\" in trying to get Obama to voice herself, and received a rejection note saying \"good try\".\n\nCultural references\nIn the classroom, Nikki shows Bart a book about vampires which looks like the Twilight series book New Moon, which reads Red Moon. In the scene where Nikki performs CPR on Bart, recreations of kissing scenes from a variety of films and television shows are shown. These scenes are (in order); From Here to Eternity (1953), Gone with the Wind (1939), The Quiet Man (1952), Lady and the Tramp (1955), Planet of the Apes (1968), On Golden Pond (1981), Ghost (1990), Spider-Man (2002), Star Trek (2009), Beauty and the Beast (1987\u20131990), The Public Enemy (1931), WALL-E (2008), Alien 3 (1992), The Godfather: Part II (1974), and an All in the Family (1971\u20131979) episode in which Sammy Davis Jr. guest starred. The sequence, and the accompanying musical score, are a nod to Cinema Paradiso (1988), directed by Giuseppe Tornatore, with score by Ennio and Andrea Morricone. The Itchy & Scratchy cartoon is a parody of the 1982 film Koyaanisqatsi: Life Out of Balance, here titled Koyaanis-Scratchy: Death Out of Balance.\n\nReception\nIn its original American broadcast, \"Stealing First Base\" was watched by 5.69 million households getting a 2.8/8 in the 18-49 Nielsen Rating. The episode came in second in its time slot and was the second most-watched show on Fox that night, after a new episode of Family Guy.\n\nEmily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club criticized the episode, giving it a C+, calling the harassment storyline \"pointless and stupid\" although praised the Nelson subplot.\n\nHowever, Jason Hughes of HuffPostTV praised the storyline, writing \"I applaud the series for facing such an issue with such intensity, and handling it with humor and compassion\".\n\nRobert Canning of IGN gave the episode an 8 out of 10, saying that \"Nikki turned out to be a fun and memorable character.\" Overall he stated that \"Although \u2018Stealing First Base\u2019 fed us some old ideas, it did so with a lot of great bits...and some very strong guest voices.\"\n\nSoundtrack \nThe scene where Bart and Nikki were performing a skateboard parkour contains the song \"Chase\" by Giorgio Moroder on the original FOX broadcast. When the episode is shown in syndication, \"Chase\" is replaced by a musically similar composition.\n\nThe classical music that is heard during the montage of movie kiss scenes is currently believed to be orchestrated specifically for the show, rather than being a score that was written independently and used during the program. Original music is from Cinema Paradiso - \"Love Theme\", composed by Andrea Morricone.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\nThe Simpsons (season 21) episodes\n2010 American television episodes", "machine_text": "Stealing first base is a term used in baseball that describes the act of a batter taking off towards first base after a pitch that is not caught by the catcher. Though it is not an official statistic, this maneuver is a daring and often successful strategy that can help a team get a win in a close game. The idea behind stealing first base is to catch the opposing team off guard and take advantage of their mistakes. The move is usually attempted with two strikes on the batter, as the catcher is likely to be more focused on the possibility of a strikeout than on keeping the ball from escaping. Once the pitch is made and the ball is not caught cleanly, the batter sprints towards first base as fast as possible. If the catcher is unable to retrieve the ball and throw it to first base before the batter arrives, the batter is safe and has successfully stolen first base. While this strategy may seem risky, it can be very effective in certain situations. For instance, if a team is down by one or two runs late in the game, stealing first base can provide an opportunity to tie or win the game. Additionally, if a team has a fast runner on base, stealing first can put two runners in scoring position, increasing the chance of scoring runs. Although it is not a common strategy, stealing first base has been used with success in professional baseball games. Notable examples include Astros outfielder Derek Fisher's steal of first base in 2018, and Yankees infielder Tyler Wade's similar maneuver in 2021. In conclusion, stealing first base is a bold and risky move that can sometimes pay off big for a team. While it may not be a common strategy, it has been used to great effect in high-pressure moments, making it a tactic worth considering for any team in need of a win.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 25986662}

Some people may have a persistent belief that they have a special power or ability that others do not possess, while others may be convinced that they are being followed by government agents or aliens. Some may believe that they are in a romantic relationship with a celebrity, or that they have a divine mission to save the world. Delusional intuition is not a mental disorder in and of itself, but rather a symptom of many psychiatric conditions, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and paranoia. It can also be caused by drugs or alcohol abuse, brain injuries, and neurological disorders. The diagnosis and treatment of delusional intuition depend on the underlying condition causing the symptom. In some cases, medication and therapy are effective in reducing the intensity of delusions and helping individuals cope with reality. In some extreme cases, hospitalization may be required to prevent harm to the individual or others. It is important to note that individuals with delusional intuition are not intentionally lying or deceiving others; they genuinely believe in their delusions. It is crucial to approach the person with empathy and understanding. Engaging in an argument or trying to convince the person that their belief is incorrect is usually unhelpful and may worsen their symptoms.

The population of the ward at the 2011 census was 12,199.  However the area dates back to the West Derby hundred district from the 12th century. The area forms part of St Helens town centre.\n\nHistory\nIn the mid 14th century, the manor of Parr was held by William Dacre, 2nd Baron Dacre.\n\nParr was one of four townships that joined together, for administrative purposes, to become St. Helens, the others being Sutton, Eccleston and Windle.\n\nThe Sankey Canal, also known as the Sankey Brook Navigation and St Helens Canal, flows through Parr. When opened in 1757, it ran from close to the mouth of Sankey Brook at the River Mersey along the valley of the Sankey Brook, ending north east of St Helens. Later extensions were made at the Mersey end, firstly to Fiddlers Ferry, then to Widnes, and at the northern end, where it was extended into what became the centre of St Helens.\n\nSt Peter's Church was built in 1864-65 to the designs of J. Medland Taylor: the stonework is in three different colours and there is a broach spire.\n\nThe area was overlooked by Bold Power Station across \"The Moss\" until the decommissioned station was demolished in the late 90s.\n\nParr has a historical link to the Parr family, most famously represented by Henry VIII's final wife Catherine Parr.  Her father Sir Thomas Parr is known to have owned or rented lands in the area.  The family seat was Parr Hall, sited in the Redgate area close to where Frodsham Drive is today.\n\nHousing\nThe area of Parr is predominately social housing, represented by three main stages of developments.  Waring Avenue Estate (developed 1950s / 60s), Concourse Way (colloquially referred to as Cement City in reference to its Pebble Dash rendering) developed in the 1960s, The Pennine Drive Estate developed in the 1950s.  Amidst these estates remain the more traditional buildings dating to the 1930s, along with Terrace Housing (1890s onwards) and private developments.\n\nThe area succumbed to social problems linked to poverty and an aging population during the 1980s with the collapse of several significant employers in St. Helens.  Its housing remains markedly cheaper than other areas of St. Helens due to a commonly perceived stigma of high crime and low education standards.\n\nSince 2006 the area, as well as other areas of St. Helens in coordination with Re:new Neighbourhood Management Project, has been targeted for regeneration. Parr was selected for the Pilot scheme and has seen increased funding to local parks and green spaces (The Duckeries for instance, formerly a slag heap, is now in the process of returning the land to its marshy origins, whilst new multi-sporting facilities and park equipment have been added to Gaskell Park and others).\n\nIn coordination with Helena Housing many council and private properties have been refurbished with new exterior walls, adding a new roof to each property, UPVC doors and double glazing.  Other projects have included a government incentive schemes for loft insulation, cavity insulation and secure gated schemes for alley access.\n\nRecently a new private housing development of detached houses, terraced homes, and flats was completed along Newton Road and adjacent to the Derbyshire Hill area, with more new-builds developed on Ashtons Green Drive, and Fleet Lane.\n\nTransport\nParr has three main access routes. The A572 (Newton Road) linking to Newton-le-Willows, the A572 (Parr Stocks Road), a direct route into St Helens town centre and the B5204 towards Burtonwood, Warrington.\n\nEducation\nThere are currently no non-denominational high schools located in Parr, since the closure of Parr High School. St. Cuthbert's is the only secondary establishment, resting on the junction of Watery Lane and Berry's Lane and the boundary of Sutton (their official address is in fact \"Sutton\"). St. Augustine's is located in nearby Blackbrook.\n\nAfter Parr High School closed, many students attend Outwood Academy Haydock.\n\nSport\nThere are no professional sporting clubs or organisations in Parr.  The area boasts a series of playing fields where the local combination football league and rugby fixtures are played as well.  One of St. Helens' swimming baths is also located in the area.\n\nBlackbrook A.R.L.F.C. is situated in the Blackbrook area of Parr.\n\nNotable people\nThe wealthy entrepreneur John Rylands was born in Parr in 1801.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Tightrope walking\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Tightrope walking, also called funambulism, is the skill of walking along a thin wire or rope. It has a long tradition in various countries and is commonly associated with the circus. Other skills similar to tightrope walking include slack rope walking and slacklining.\n\nTypes\n\nTightwire is the skill of maintaining balance while walking along a tensioned wire between two points. It can be done either using a balancing tool (umbrella, fan, balance pole, etc.) or \"freehand\", using only one's body to maintain balance. Typically, tightwire performances either include dance or object manipulation. Object manipulation acts include a variety of props in their acts, such as clubs, rings, hats, or canes. Tightwire performers have even used wheelbarrows with passengers, ladders, and animals in their act. The technique to maintain balance is to keep the performer's centre of mass above their support point\u2014usually their feet.\n\nHighwire is a form of tightwire walking but performed at much greater height. Although there is no official height when tightwire becomes highwire, generally a wire over  high are regarded as a highwire act.\n\nSkywalk is a form of highwire which is performed at great heights and length. A skywalk is performed outdoors between tall buildings, gorges, across waterfalls or other natural and man-made structures.\n\nRopes\nIf the \"lay\" of the rope (the orientation of the constituent strands, the \"twist\" of a rope) is in one direction, the rope can twist on itself as it stretches and relaxes. Underfoot, this could be hazardous to disastrous in a tightrope. One solution is for the rope core to be made of steel cable, laid in the opposite direction to the outer layers, so that twisting forces balance each other out.\n\nBiomechanics\nAcrobats maintain their balance by positioning their centre of mass directly over their base of support, i.e. shifting most of their weight over their legs, arms, or whatever part of their body they are using to hold them up. When they are on the ground with their feet side by side, the base of support is wide in the lateral direction but narrow in the sagittal (back-to-front) direction. In the case of highwire-walkers, their feet are parallel with each other, one foot positioned in front of the other while on the wire. Therefore, a tightwire walker's sway is side to side, their lateral support having been drastically reduced.  In both cases, whether side by side or parallel, the ankle is the pivot point.\n\nA wire-walker may use a pole for balance or may stretch out his arms perpendicular to his trunk in the manner of a pole. This technique provides several advantages. It distributes mass away from the pivot point, thereby increasing the moment of inertia. This reduces angular acceleration, so a greater torque is required to rotate the performer over the wire. The result is less tipping. In addition, the performer can also correct sway by rotating the pole. This will create an equal and opposite torque on the body.\n\nTightwire-walkers typically perform in very thin and flexible, leather-soled slippers with a full-length suede or leather sole to protect the feet from abrasions and bruises, while still allowing the foot to curve around the wire. Though very infrequent in performance, amateur, hobbyist, or inexperienced funambulists will often walk barefoot so that the wire can be grasped between the big and second toe. This is more often done when using a rope, as the softer and silkier fibres are less taxing on the bare foot than the harder and more abrasive braided wire.\n\nFamous tightrope artists\n\nCharles Blondin, a.k.a.

For instance, politicians are said to \"walk a tightrope\" when trying to balance two opposing views with little room for compromise. The term can also be used in satirical or acidic contexts. Nicholas Taleb uses the phrase in his book The Black Swan. \"You get respect for doing funambulism or spectator sports\". Taleb is criticising scientists who prefer popularism to vigorous research and those who walk a fixed and narrow path rather than explore a large field of empirical study.\n\nSee also\n\nReferences\n\n \nCircus skills", "machine_text": "Tightrope walking is the act of walking or performing acrobatic maneuvers on a thin wire or rope, typically stretched between two anchor points. This thrilling and dangerous activity has been practiced for centuries, with its roots in ancient China and Greece.

As a parolee he develops a relationship with a lonely and troubled woman, whom he saves from a violent attack, killing the assailant in the process. Once more on the run, he is forced to re-evaluate his freedom as he evades the law and faces demons from his past. The film was shot on location in various small towns in southern Illinois: Alton, Wood River, East Alton, and Jerseyville. Produced by James Choi, Brian Jun, and Max Velez for 40/West, the film premiered on April 29, 2011 at the Newport Beach Film Festival.\n\nPlot\nWhile doing time in prison for a violent offense, Nick Burke (Mark Pellegrino) is visited by his wife who informs him that after waiting for seven years, she is divorcing him and has taken out a restraining order against him to prevent him from seeing their daughter. Sometime later, after accepting the parole board's condition that he relinquish all custodial rights of his daughter, he is given his freedom.

He meets with his parole officer, finds a small motel room, and attends an AA meeting.\n\nNick's younger brother Dean (Ryan O'Nan) visits him at the motel and describes his life as a newlywed and police officer, having just graduated from the police academy. Although their relationship seems strained, Nick still looks to connect with his brother, even though he never visited him in prison. Before leaving, Dean gives his older brother a gun for protection. Nick soon finds work at a manufacturing plant.\n\nAt the motel, Nick meets a lonely and troubled stripper named Michelle Page (Alicia Witt), whose isolated life is interrupted by the deaths of her elderly neighbors. Nick asks his attractive neighbor out for coffee, and the two begin to share their stories with each other.\n\nOne morning, Michelle's former acquaintance Danny Wilson (Tom Guiry), whom she hasn't seen in three years, shows up after his three-year tour of duty in Afghanistan, expecting to rekindle their relationship.

There they get a glimpse of a domestic life they have never known. The relationship between the two brothers remains strained, yet Nick reaches out to make some familial connection with Dean, whose only advice is to \"disappear\".\n\nThe next morning, Nick and Michelle leave in Nick's old truck, knowing they have become outlaws on the run. They find solace in each other's arms that night in a motel. Soon after, police detectives arrive at Dean's house with the gun he gave his brother.

Joints are responsible for enabling movement in the body and are divided into different types, including synarthroses or immovable joints, amphiarthroses or slightly movable joints, and diarthroses or freely movable joints. The latter, also known as synovial joints, are the most common type of joint in the body. A joint body, also known as an articulation, is the part of the body where two or more bones meet. These joints can be classified based on their structure and range of motion. Structural classifications include fibrous, cartilaginous, and synovial joints, while functional classifications include synarthroses, amphiarthroses, and diarthroses. Common examples of synovial joints in the human body include the ball-and-socket joint found in the hip and shoulder, hinge joints found in the elbow and knee, and pivot joints found in the neck and forearm. These joints have a fluid-filled space between the articulating surfaces of the bones called the synovial cavity, which is lined with a layer of synovial membrane that secretes synovial fluid. This fluid nourishes and lubricates the joint, allowing for smooth movement. Joint bodies can also be affected by a variety of conditions, including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and other inflammatory disorders. These conditions can cause pain, stiffness, and decreased range of motion, and may require medical treatment such as medication, physical therapy, or surgery. In summary, joint bodies are an essential part of the human anatomy responsible for enabling movement in the body. They come in different types and can be affected by various conditions, highlighting the importance of maintaining joint health and seeking medical attention when necessary.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 40341140}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Soda locomotive\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Soda locomotives were a variant of fireless locomotives, in which steam was raised in a boiler, expanded through cylinders in the usual way, and then condensed in a tank of caustic soda that surrounded the boiler. Dissolving water in caustic soda liberated heat, which generated more steam from the boiler, until the caustic soda became too dilute to release heat at a useful temperature.\n\nTechnical description \nThese closed-loop steam engines had no firebox. The boiler was jacketed by a container loaded with about 5 tons of caustic soda (sodium hydroxide). When water or steam came in contact with the caustic soda, it would generate heat \u2014 enough to actually run the boiler and generate more steam. Steam emanating from the boiler would be fed through pistons to propel the locomotive forward, and the exhaust steam from the pistons would be fed into the caustic soda to continue the cycle. These vehicles were virtually silent, because the steam was not released into the atmosphere.\n\nA soda locomotive could run for several hours, but eventually the soda would become diluted and wouldn't produce enough heat to continue generating steam. For reconcentrating, the caustic soda was either transferred out of the boiler of the locomotive and boiled in open vats, or, rather more conveniently, by injecting superheated steam at a high enough temperature to boil off the water in solution. A stationary boiler would be hooked up and feed superheated steam through the soda to boil off the water and effectively recharge the soda.\n\nThese locomotives were always called \"soda locomotives\" (sodium carbonate) although \"caustic soda locomotives\" (sodium hydroxide) would be a more precise description. The misleading terminology was most likely used, to increase their acceptance by the public, which was used to using washing soda but might have been frightened by the nasty alkali burns sitting next to several tons of hot caustic soda.\n\nOther salts such as calcium chloride could also be used.\n\nAdvantages and disadvantages\n\nAdvantages \n The soda locomotives were quiet, by which they were more beneficial than compressed-air motors.\n The soda locomotives did not leave any smoke, sparks or soot.\n Low quality coal could be used in the fixed installation that reconcentrated the caustic soda.\n There was no need to carry coal around.\n\nDisadvantages \n The weight of the big tank of caustic soda reduced performance or efficiency.\n The risk of nasty burns caused by caustic soda. A boiler explosion would have had very serious consequences.\n The reconcentration boilers needed to be replaced regularly due to corrosion.\n\nLocomotives \n The Perkins calcium chloride engine, 1864\n The Spence caustic soda boiler, 1874\n The Honigmann caustic soda locomotive, 1885\n The Baldwin soda motors, 1886\n\nReferences \n\nSteam vehicles\nSteam locomotive types\nEnergy storage", "machine_text": "Soda locomotive is a type of locomotive that runs on soda, which is a type of fuel made from sodium carbonate or bicarbonate and limestone. The soda locomotive was developed as an alternative to traditional fossil fuel-based locomotives, which emit harmful greenhouse gases and contribute to climate change. The concept of using soda as a fuel dates back to the 19th century when a British chemist named James Muspratt proposed the idea of using sodium carbonate as a fuel for steam engines. However, it was not until the 21st century that the idea was taken seriously and developed into an operational locomotive. The soda locomotive works by using soda as a fuel source to power the engine. The soda is mixed with water and heated to produce steam, which is used to operate the locomotive's pistons. The steam then condenses back into water and is recycled back to the boiler, making the process extremely efficient and environmentally friendly. One of the main advantages of soda locomotives is their low carbon emissions. Unlike fossil fuel-based locomotives, soda locomotives emit only water vapor and do not contribute to climate change. Furthermore, soda is a renewable resource, making it an excellent alternative to non-renewable fossil fuels. Another advantage of soda locomotives is their simplicity. They do not require complex machinery or advanced technology and can be easily operated and maintained. Moreover, they are less expensive to operate than traditional locomotives, particularly in regions where soda is readily available and affordable. Despite their advantages, soda locomotives are still in the experimental phase and are not widely used. However, they hold great promise as an alternative to fossil fuel-based locomotives and could play a crucial role in reducing carbon emissions and combating climate change in the future.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 47663720}

It is the second-most heavily populated district on the island and is located on its northwestern coast.\n\nDescription\nTerrain in the district is quite varied with steep ridges and a limited amount of flat ground, as befits the island's volcanic origin. It is mainly rural and lacks any main settlement as there are many small villages dispersed throughout. Its population has fluctuated from 795 in 1998 to 908 in 2008 and 843 in 2016.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Caregiver burden\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Caregiver burden is the stress which is perceived by caregivers due to the home care situation.  The subjective burden is considered to be one of the most important predictors of negative outcomes from the home care situation.\n\nTheory \nFrom a scientific perspective, caregiver burden is a theoretical construct. The conceptual basis for the appraisal of the care situation is the Transactional Model of Lazarus and Folkman.\nThe subjective evaluation of the care situation (stressor) by the caregivers is critical for the development and maintenance of subjective burden.\n\nAccording to the Transactional Model, people deal with stressful situations by appraisals of stressor and resources. The primary appraisal deals with the individual meaning of the specific stressor, which is the care situation in this case. The secondary appraisal analyzes the own abilities and resources to cope with that situation. On this basis, the individual coping efforts are used to deal with the stressful situation. As per Carver, these efforts can focus on problem management or emotional regulation. Dysfunctional strategies are possible, too. Studies found that a high caregiver burden often comes along with dysfunctional strategies what means activities which don\u2019t solve the problem but worsen it (e.g. self-criticism, substance abuse).\n\nThe (dis)balance between burden/vulnerabilities and resources of the caregiver determines the consequences of a care situation. Home care can result in positive as well as negative experiences.\n\nRegardless of the caregiver burden, relatives can experience benefits - positive consequences - of the home care situation. This may be the feeling of being needed or the knowledge that they have acquired new skills etc.\n\nTriggers for caregiver burden \nCaregiver burden comes out when the caregiver perceives the home care situation as a negative experience. Caregivers are typically not trained. Caring is a serious challenge for them. An intensive adaptiation to the care situation is necessary.\n\nThe caregiver burden can be based on a variety of aspects of the care situation (e.g. lack of recovery time, challenging behavior of the care requiring person, limitation of social activities and contacts). Studies showed that four aspects are particularly burdensome:\n Care costs much energy\n Desire for recovery\n Too little time for own interests\n Sadness over the fate of the supported person\n\nMeaning of subjective burden \nNegative outcomes are often not determined by the specifics of the caregiving situation itself, but by the reaction and response of the caregiver. The term \u201ccaregiver burden\u201d refers to the high level of stress that some caregivers may feel in response to the situation. Because the caregiver burden may be felt strongly by one person and not at all by another, regardless of the caregiving situation, it is considered to be subjective and it may be called the \u201csubjective burden\u201d. The subjective burden is considered to be one of the most important predictors of negative outcomes from the home care situation.\n\nImpact on health \nPinquart and S\u00f6rensen (2003) researched the health of caregivers compared to the health of non-caregiving relatives. The researchers found that while caregivers are generally only slightly less physically healthy than non-caregiving relatives, they reported depressive symptoms significantly more often, pointing to a negative effect on their mental health.\n\nThis meta-analysis did not consider the impact of subjective burden. In another extensive meta-analysis Pinquart and S\u00f6rensen could show that the subjective burden is an important predictor of the health of carers.\n\nRisk of mortality \nStudies found an increased mortality of caregiving spouses. This effect was only found for spouses who felt burdened due to the care situation. Thus, it is not the home care per se that is a risk but the subjective burden.\n\nWithout consideration of the caregiver burden, the mortality of caregivers is even slightly reduced compared to non-caregivers.\n\nCaring style \nPeople who experience caregiver burden can display a wide range of behaviors towards the person in need of care, from loving devotion to abusive behavior (which can manifest as neglect and/or mistreatment). The most common form of abusive behavior is verbal aggression, mainly due to challenging behaviour of the person in need of care. Researchers found that people experiencing caregiver burden are more likely to display abusive behavior and other negative caring styles toward the individuals  they care for than those who are not experiencing caregiver burden.\n\nEnding home care \nThe caregiver burden often influences the caregiver\u2019s decision to eventually institutionalize (or, \u201cput someone in a nursing home\u201d. Caregiver burden is particularly associated with the care of people with dementia, meaning that the likelihood of institutionalization is especially heightened in those experiencing caregiver burden who care for people suffering from dementia. In the care of people with dementia, there is consistent evidence: The higher the caregiver burden, the more likely is the institutionalization.\n\nMeasuring caregiver burden \nThe assessment of caregiver burden enables to judge the situation of the caregiver. The correct measurement of subjective burden is necessary to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of family interventions.\n\nThe care situation is an important, highly specific stressor which should be treated with specific interventions. A measurement with general stress-scales is therefore not useful, because in this case the score represents all kind of stress, indiscriminately of its origin. Valid, economic and internationally standardized measurement tools for the specific stressful situation of family caregivers are therefore inevitable.\n\nIn Anglo-American countries, a number of burden scales have been developed; e.g. the Burden Interview, the Caregiver Strain Index and the Cost of Care Index. The Burden Scale for Family Caregivers, which has been developed in Germany, is now available in 20 languages.\n\nBurden Scale for Family Caregivers (BSFC) \nThe BSFC exists in a detailed version with 28 items, and in a short, more efficient version (BFSC-s) with ten items.\n\nCompared to other burden scales, the BSFC has two benefits. There is a long and a short version, both validated in separate studies. Furthermore, both versions are free in 20 languages inclusive introduction for evaluation and interpretation.\n\nDevelopment \nA first, reliable and valid version of the German version was published in 1993. In 2001, the validity was tested and confirmed to a large sample of both dementia and for other causes of care requirement again. In 2003, the English version has been validated. In 2014, the validation study for the short version and an extended validation of the original version have been published.\n\nScale \nThe BSFC consists of 28 items in the detailed or 10 items in the short version. The caregivers have to rate these items on a four-point scale from \u201cstrongly agree\u201d to \u201cstrongly disagree\u201d.\n\nAn evaluation is possible both on item level and on score level. A differentiated detection of the critical aspects of home care is possible with the analysis on item level. The score measures the total burden. This is an important factor to judge the caregiver's situation.\n\nCaregivers\u00b4 Daily Issues (CDIs) \nThe CDIs is dealing with 9 main issues of caregivers based on the topical analysis of caregivers\u00b4 social media communication. A longitudinal analysis of 100 dyads (caregiver vs person with Alzheimer disease) revealed following structure of issues.\n\nInterventions \nDue to the high importance of the caregiver burden with regard to the care giving process, it is necessary to develop interventions to reduce this burden and to examine their effectiveness. Successful interventions should be available to as many caregivers as possible. \"The usefulness of an intervention is the multiplication of effectiveness and usage.\u201d (Elmar Gr\u00e4\u00dfel) It is therefore both necessary to develop interventions and to improve and to find ways to strengthen the awareness and use of these interventions.\n\nInterventions and services\nUnburdening interventions for caregivers should consider four central aspects:\n Information and training\n Professional support\n Effective communication\n Public and financial support\nThere are different supporting services, e.g. caregiver counselling, professional training, self-help groups, ambulant nursing services or technical help like intelligent light to preserve the autonomy of the person in need of care.\n\nAnother effective relief is the support given to caregivers by family members, friends and acquaintances. They provide emotional and instrumental support and are an important source to access supporting services.\n\nA 2021 Cochrane review found that remotely delivered interventions including support, training and information may reduce the burden for the informal caregiver and improve their depressive symptoms. However, there is no certain evidence that they improve health-related quality of life. The findings are based on moderate certainty evidence from 26 studies.\n\nImplications to strengthen and develop the informal caregiving\n Services should be made better known.\n The regional availability of support services should be made increased.\n Case management services should increase the effectivity of unburdening concepts.\n Public financial support should be made more available.\n The basic conditions of caregiving should allow the combination of care and occupation.\n Job conditions should be developed. No disadvantages should arise for caregivers who restrict the scope of their employment or temporarily give it up completely.\n Language barriers should be reduced. Low-threshold offers in information, counselling and support should be intercultural orientated.\n Internet based support should be extended.\n There is a lack of qualitative empirical studies on the impact of unburdening interventions. Evidence based health services research should focus on that point.\n\nReferences \n\nCaregiving\nNursing\nPsychological stress", "machine_text": "Caregiver burden refers to the physical, emotional, and financial stress experienced by individuals who provide care to a loved one who is ill, disabled, or elderly. The burden encompasses a range of tasks, including bathing and grooming, transportation, medication management, cooking, and cleaning. Caregiver burden is particularly common among individuals who care for those with chronic illnesses such as dementia, cancer, and heart disease. The burden of caregiving can be significant, with caregivers often experiencing higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression than non-caregivers. Caregiver burnout is a common issue, with many caregivers feeling overwhelmed, exhausted, and guilty for not doing enough for their loved ones. In some cases, caregiver burden can also have a detrimental impact on the caregiver's physical health, with studies suggesting that caregivers have a higher risk of developing conditions such as hypertension, depression, and chronic pain. Caregiver burden can also have a significant financial impact, with many caregivers having to give up their jobs or reduce their work hours to provide care. This can lead to financial strain and difficulties with paying bills and affording necessary medical care. There are several strategies that can help reduce caregiver burden, including respite care, counseling, and support groups. Respite care provides temporary relief for caregivers, allowing them to take a break and focus on their own needs. Counseling and support groups can provide caregivers with emotional support and practical advice on coping with the stress of caregiving.

Although Leinster had been appearing regularly in The Smart Set and pulp magazines such as Argosy and Short Stories for three years, \"The Runaway Skyscraper\" was his first published science fiction story (or more accurately, scientific romance, since Hugo Gernsback had yet to coin the phrase \"science fiction\").  Gernsback would reprint the story in the third issue of his science fiction pulp magazine Amazing Stories in June 1926.\n\nPlot summary\n\"The Runaway Skyscraper\" concerns Arthur Chamberlain, an engineer who works in a midtown Manhattan office building called the Metropolitan Tower.  When the sun suddenly begins moving backwards in the sky, setting rapidly in the east, he is the only one to realize what is actually happening: a flaw in the rock beneath the building has caused it to subside, but instead of moving in space, the building is falling backwards into the past.  When the subsidence finally ends, the building is located several thousand years in the past, and its 2000-odd inhabitants find themselves stranded in pre-Columbian Manhattan.\n\nChamberlain also realizes that the same seismic forces that caused the building to drop back into the past can also be used to return it to the present, but that doing so will require several weeks of intensive work by the building's inhabitants, and in the meantime they must concentrate on feeding themselves.  Chamberlain convinces the president of a bank on the first floor that he can return them to the present, and together they are able to organize the other inhabitants into hunting and fishing parties.\n\nTwo weeks later, Chamberlain is ready to implement his plan.  He forces a jet of soapy water into an artesian well beneath the building, and this allows the pressure that has built up in the rock to be released.  The building travels forward in time again, returning to the exact moment when it began to travel into the past.\n\nReception\n\nIn 2013, Amazing Stories described it as \"monumental\" and \"an ageless story of adventure and endurance\".

The idea of a runaway skyscraper was a popular subject in science fiction during the early 20th century, and The Runaway Skyscraper was one of the earliest examples. The story centers around the fictional Skyscraper Holding Trust Company, which owns and operates a massive skyscraper in the heart of New York City. One day, the employees of the company notice strange vibrations in the building and soon realize that the entire skyscraper has become mobile, moving slowly and inexorably down the streets of the city. The story follows the various attempts to stop the runaway building and the fearful reactions of the people of New York as they witness the destruction caused by the towering structure. The story deals with themes of technological advancement and unchecked ambition, as well as the fear and panic that can arise in the face of the unknown and seemingly uncontrollable. It also serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of prioritizing profit and progress over safety and responsibility.

There is also a reference to the science of noetics, which covers the field of thinking and knowing, thought and knowledge, as well as mental operations, processes, states, and products through the data of the written word.\n\nPhilosophy\nThe term itself means \"the proper exercise of nous\" whereas nous (\"mind, understanding, intellect\") is described as \"the highest faculty in man, through which - provided it is purified - he knows God or the inner essences or principles of created things by means of direct apprehension or spiritual perception\". In ancient Greek and medieval philosophy, noetic topics included the doctrine of the active intellect (Aristotle, Averroes) and the doctrine of the Divine Intellect (Plotinus).\n\nThe entire philosophy of noetics, which include the notions by Immanuel Kant, John Locke, Ren\u00e9 Descartes, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, and Jean-Paul Sartre, among others is involved with thinking of intellection by analogy with vision. In Critique of Pure Reason, Kant argues that viewing the world scientifically must be according to the Newtonian system. This constitutes the so-called \"noetic skepticism\" because we cannot determine if the Newtonian world is indeed the truth.\n\nLate modern philosopher and phenomenologist Franz Brentano introduced a distinction between sensory and noetic consciousness: the former describes presentations of sensory objects or intuitions, while the latter describes the thinking of concepts. (See also Noesis (phenomenology).)\n\nOther uses\nThinkers like Lawrence Krader consider noetics as a science, an empirical discipline that concerns itself with the processes, states, and events in the real world of space and time.\n\nNoetics is also useful in psychology such as the way it overlaps with Jamesian psychology, which deals with a range of phenomena (including emotions and feelings) that influence our thinking and knowing.\n\nThe Institute of Noetic Sciences (founded in 1973) describes noetic sciences as \"how beliefs, thoughts, and intentions affect the physical world\". Since the 1970s and the foundation of the Institute of Noetic Sciences by NASA astronaut Edgar Mitchell and others, the term \"noetics\" has been adopted by several authors such as Christian de Quincey in Deep Spirit: Cracking the Noetic Code (2008) and Dan Brown in The Lost Symbol (2009), who write about consciousness and spirituality.\n\nThinker Pierre Grimes leads the Noetic Society for the Study of Dialogue and the Exploration of Dialectic (founded in 1967), a philosophical counseling group.\n\nSee also\nPhilosophy\n Neoplatonism \n Medieval Christian philosophy of intellect\n Panpsychism\n Noology, another term for the same field\n\nContemporary philosophy\nNoesis\nPhilosophy of mind\n\nAlternative philosophy and parapsychology\n Integral thought and Ken Wilber\n Institute of Noetic Sciences and Christian de Quincey\n New Thought\n Noosphere\n\nCybernetics\n Technoetic\n\nClassical psychology\n Logotherapy and Viktor Frankl\n\nEastern Orthodox Christianity\n Philokalia by St. Philotheos of Sinai, Volume 3, 1986, p.\u00a016\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n Davidson, H.

It is an interdisciplinary field that combines philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, physics, and spirituality. The term \"noetics\" is derived from the Greek word \"nous\", which means \"mind\" or \"intellect\". Noetics examines the fundamental questions of life, such as the nature of consciousness, the meaning of existence, the relationship between mind and matter, and the possibility of spiritual experiences. It seeks to explore the hidden potentials of the human mind, and to unlock the mysteries of the universe. One of the main focuses of noetics is the study of consciousness. This includes exploring altered states of consciousness, such as those experienced during meditation, psychedelic use, or near-death experiences. Noetics also studies the effects of consciousness on physical reality, such as the power of intention, remote healing, and psychic phenomena. Another aspect of noetics is the exploration of spiritual experiences, including mystical experiences, spiritual awakening, and transcendental states of consciousness. Noetics views these experiences as a way of accessing deeper levels of reality, and as a means of connecting with the divine or higher self. Noetics has been criticized by some mainstream scientists and skeptics for lacking empirical evidence and for being based on unproven beliefs. However, proponents of noetics argue that it is a legitimate field of study, and that its explorations of consciousness and spirituality are essential for a complete understanding of human existence. In recent years, noetics has gained increased recognition and support, with the establishment of research institutes such as the Institute of Noetic Sciences. Noetics has also generated interest among the general public, with the popularity of books and films such as The Secret and What the Bleep Do We Know!?", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 15558666}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"The Orwell Society\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Orwell Society is a literary society and a UK registered charity.  It was founded in 2011 with the aim of promoting the understanding and appreciation of the life and work of George Orwell (the pen name of Eric Arthur Blair 1903-1950). Its patron is Richard Blair, George Orwell\u2019s adopted son.\n\nThe society has no political affiliation and does not speculate on what Orwell might have thought of current political issues were he alive today.\n\nHistory\nIn 2004, Dione Venables, of Finlay Publishers, published a revised edition Eric & Us, a memoir written by Jacintha Buddicom who died in 1994.  The book was originally published in 1974 by Leslie Frewin and focused on Eric Blair\u2019s childhood and teenage years. Buddicom was Venables' first cousin who left Venables the copyrights to the book in her will.  The acclaimed Orwell biographer, Gordon Bowker, in agreeing to review the book, suggested certain clarifications and in late 2006, \"Eric & Us: The Postscript Edition\" was published. The postscript edition was regularly discussed on a website called \u201cOrwell Direct\u201d, creating a small community of enthusiasts whose first contributor was Sir Bernard Crick. The community, which included Orwell's son Richard Blair, began to ask why there was no Society to promote the life and works of George Orwell, prompting Venables to focus her efforts on constituting one.\n \nOn 27 December 2010, a group gathered for the first informal meeting at Phyllis Court, Henley-on-Thames (which the young Eric Blair had often visited). The day was hosted by Venables and, of those attending that day, Christopher Edwards agreed to be the society\u2019s first Chair. Richard Blair accepted the role as Patron, Charles Wiggin as Treasurer, Dominic Cavendish took on the editorship of the society\u2019s website, and Venables agreed to be Membership Secretary. Later on, Ron Bateman took on the Secretary role and Chris Organ was appointed to provide legal input.  The formal inaugural meeting was held on 19 April 2011 and in the same year, Quentin Kopp, whose father Georges Kopp had been Orwell\u2019s commandant and friend during and after the Spanish Civil War, joined the committee as Events Secretary and the society was launched.  On 28 April 2012, The Society held its first Annual General Meeting at Senate House, London \u2013 next to Room 101 (made famous in Nineteen Eighty-Four).\n\nCharitable purpose\nThe Society has a charitable purpose to advance education about Orwell\u2019s life and work for the public benefit.  This is achieved through a number of student bursaries and prizes, as well as memorials and commemorative plaques. The society also organises a number of member events including to Spain (to visit sites that feature in Homage to Catalonia, Orwell\u2019s memoir of the Spanish Civil War) and to the island of Jura (where Orwell completed the final draft of his most famous novel Nineteen Eighty-Four).\n\nSome historical antipathy towards George Orwell from the people of Wigan was rectified in 2017, 80 years after the publication of The Road to Wigan Pier, by demonstrating that Orwell had not been critical of Wigan people. Richard Blair participated as one of the narrators in \"Beyond Wigan Pier\", an opera first performed in 2018, aimed at attracting funding for students to attend Music & Drama school.\n\nGovernance\nThe Orwell Society is currently governed by nine elected trustees, who administer the UK registered charity. Current trustees are\n\nAnnual General Meeting (AGM)\nThe Society\u2019s Annual AGM is typically held towards the end of April, usually at a location in London, each featuring a notable guest speaker. The first AGM in 2012 was held at Senate House, London, when an Honorary Life Membership was awarded to Professor Peter Davison for his unparalleled contribution towards the editing and publication of Orwell's work, including the twenty-volume The Complete Works of George Orwell.\n\nPublications\nThe twice-yearly Society Journal started out as the annual 'Newsletter,\u2019 the first two editions being edited and designed by Ron Bateman and Christopher Edwards. In 2013, Ron Bateman took over the editorship of the publication, which was renamed, \"The Orwell Society Journal\". He stepped down as editor in 2016 to be replaced by Masha Karp. In 2015, Dione Venables published the first collection of George Orwell\u2019s Poetry, which was approved for public release a few months later, with all proceeds from the book being donated to the society.\n\nOrwell Statue\nOn the 7th November 2017, a statue of Orwell sculpted by Martin Jennings, was unveiled outside Broadcasting House.  The idea for the statue and its location came from Ben Whitaker MP who created a Trustee Board of distinguished people to raise the money.  Following Ben Whitaker\u2019s death in 2014, the fund raising was completed by his widow Baroness Janet Whitaker and the sculpture was commissioned after securing the commitment of the BBC.  Baroness Whitaker and Richard Blair delivered short speeches before unveiling the Statue.  The wall behind the statue is engraved with the words: \"If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear\", a quote attributed to Orwell's proposed preface to Animal Farm. Baroness Whitaker and the Trustee Board invited The Orwell Society to take over ownership of the Statue.

Programs can differ according to setting; although practitioner-teacher model programs are typically found in colleges of medicine, health professions, or allied health, classroom-based programs can be found in colleges of business or public health.\n\nStructure\nThe degree program is designed to give graduates of health disciplines (in particular) greater understanding of management issues and prepare them for senior management roles, and is awarded by many American, European, Australian, Indian and Sri Lankan (Post Graduate Institute of Medicine \u2013 University of Colombo) universities. \nThe degree traditionally focuses on health administration at the local, state, and federal level as well as in the nonprofit sector. This contrasts with the general Master of Business Administration or the Master of Public Administration degrees.\n\nAccredited programs of study typically require students to complete applied experiences as well as course work in areas such as population health, healthcare economics, health policy, organizational behavior, management of healthcare organizations, healthcare marketing and communications, human resource management, information systems management and assessment, operations assessment and improvement, governance, leadership, statistical analysis and application, financial analysis and management, and strategy formulation and implementation.\n\nMHA programs are thus intended to provide students with the essential knowledge required for senior managerial and planning work in the health services and systems sectors.

In the same way the AACSB evaluates accreditation for MBA programs; CAHME accreditation requires programs to meet a set of standards related to areas such as program resources, faculty preparation, curriculum content, and post-graduation career success, and also helps to ensure that the programs are well integrated with the practice communities their graduates will work within.\n\nApplicants to accredited programs are required to hold a four-year undergraduate degree prior to enrolling.  Some universities offer dual MBA/MHA degrees with AACSB accreditation, or MBA/HOM degree programs, which may be completed concurrently or sequentially.   Some MHA programs do not require professional experience prior to enrollment; however, most programs require work experience, such as internships or fellowships, as part of their graduation requirements.  Some MHA programs use a blended lecture and online format, allowing people to continue working while they pursue the MHA degree.  There are also a few universities, including many for-profit universities, that offer Master of Healthcare Administration programs completely online; however, these programs are not currently eligible for CAHME accreditation because of concerns about the effectiveness of online programs as an analog for developing interpersonal and team-based skills which are more typically face-to-face in their use in post-graduation professional roles.\n\nMost Master of Healthcare Administration-equivalent graduate programs in the United States are offered by schools of public health, business, allied health, or, less frequently, by schools of medicine.

The airport is located  north of central Z\u00fcrich, in the municipalities of Kloten, R\u00fcmlang, Oberglatt, Winkel, and Opfikon, all of which are within the canton of Z\u00fcrich.\n\nHistory\n\nEarly years\nIn the Zurich area, mixed civil and military air traffic developed from 1909 onwards at D\u00fcbendorf airfield, northeast of the city. From 1919, the airport was home to Swissair's predecessor Ad Astra Aero, and from 1932 also to Swissair. The first international flight from Switzerland landed on July 21, 1921.  In the early years of aviation, the D\u00fcbendorf Air Base, located some  to the Zurich Airport, also served as the city's commercial airfield. The need for a dedicated commercial facility led to the search for a location at which to build a replacement airport.\n\nIn 1939, civil air traffic had to be suspended at the outbreak of the Second World War for military strategic reasons. Although Swissair was allowed to resume scheduled air traffic in September 1940, this remained on a modest scale during the war.\n\nIn March 1943, the government of the canton of Zurich commissioned a study to identify possible locations for the construction of a major airport. In its report, a consortium of engineers and architects led by Locher & Cie company advised against the previously discussed expansion options at D\u00fcbendorf airport and instead recommended a separate civil airport in the partially forested moorland area of the armory situated between Kloten and Oberglatt. In August 1943, the Federal Military Department declared its agreement to abandon the armory as a matter of principal \"in the higher national interest\".\n\nLocher & Cie submitted \"Project I\" to the Government on 31 December 1943. Four runways were planned and together with the buildings the required area was 472 hectares. Without the purchase of land, the project would have cost 87 million CHF. The government found the costs too high and ordered a revision. The \"Project II\" of 29 April 1944 still provided for an area of 290 hectares and costs of 65 million CHF, but the government council demanded a further reduction. For \"Project III\" of 31 July 1944, 54.4 million and 215 hectares were required. The project nevertheless met the requirements of an intercontinental airport. The Government formally approved it and submitted it to the Federal Government, strongly emphasizing that the Zurich project was \"far superior\" to the also planned (and ultimately abandoned) Swiss Central Airport Utzenstorf near Bern.\n\nIn December 1944, the responsible Federal Councillor, Enrico Celio, explicitly spoke out in favour of Zurich-Kloten, in a letter to his counterparts, as did the governments of the cantons of Eastern and Central Switzerland and Ticino a month later. The National Council and Council of States followed this view and on 22 June 1945 approved the \"Federal Decree on the Expansion of Civil Airports\". Basel, Bern and Geneva were to receive smaller continental airports and be supported with a 30 percent share of the costs. The Zurich project was granted the status of an intercontinental airport and the highest possible subsidy rate of 35 percent.\n\nSwitzerland's federal parliament decided in 1945 that Z\u00fcrich was to be the site of a major airport, and sold  of the Kloten-B\u00fclach Artillery Garrison () to the canton of Z\u00fcrich, giving the canton control of the new airfield. Construction of the airport began the following year.\n\nInitial plans for the airport, as laid out in the Federal government's scheme of 1945, were centered on facilities capable of handling international airline traffic. Aircraft of up to 80 tons were envisaged. The primary runway was to be designed for use in all weathers and at night, with a -wide hard surface running to  in length. Additional  areas were to be provided on the shoulders for lateral protection in case of runway excursions. Additional domestic runways, between  in length, were also to be built.\n\nFirst stage of construction: civil engineering \nOn 25 February 1946, the Zurich Cantonal Council approved a building loan of 36.8 million. The cantonal referendum of 5 May 1946 resulted in a clear approval with 105,705 votes in favour, 29,372 against.\n\"Project IV\" never came to fruition, as it was further developed by adapting it to the ICAO standards which were changing rapidly at the time. Instead of four runways, the new \"Project V\" of 20 May 1946 provided only three. Project VI\" of 9 October 1946 increased the dimensions of all three runways. Finally, the slightly modified \"Project VII\" of 20 December 1947 was realised.\nWithin three years, the design on the drawing board had completely changed from a purely grass airfield with a four-runway system without taxiways to a three-runway system with paved taxiways. The staggered design meant that it was possible to react to changes without having to impose a complete halt to construction.\n\nConstruction works finally began on 5 May 1946 with the diversion of the Altbach stream. The 1900 m long West Runway 10/28 was the first runway which was opened on 14 June 1948, and on which the first Swissair Douglas DC-4 took off for London. On behalf of the canton as airport owner, Cantonal Councillor Jakob K\u00e4gi gave a speech to mark the inauguration of the new runway and the start of provisional flight operations. Shortly after, on 17 November 1948, the 2600 m long blind runway 16/34 (runway with instrument landing system) was opened for operation, which was attended by the seven members of the cantonal government. In the presence of invited guests from politics and the media as well as representatives of the construction companies and airlines, the new airport was inaugurated, which meant that the relocation of the entire civil flight operations from D\u00fcbendorf to Kloten had already been completed and full operation could begin at the new Zurich airport.\n\nThe 1535 m long Bisen runway 02/20, which belonged to the three-runway system of 1948, was of little importance. Due to the applicable crosswind regulations at that time, the runway was designed to face the Bise in order to guarantee the airport's all-weather capability. However, the ICAO increased the crosswind tolerances for aircraft in subsequent revisions to such an extent that the runway was decommissioned after just over ten years.\n\nFirst stage of construction: structural engineering \nThe character of a provisional solution was supported - despite full operation - by the lack of buildings, especially the \"Flughof\", which had been planned since 1946. Instead, a growing shanty town stood to the east of the reserved building site. On 27 October 1948, the canton outsourced the development, construction and operation of the buildings to the newly founded \"Flughafen-Immobilien-Gesellschaft\" (FIG), a mixed-economy public limited company in which the public sector held half of the shares (canton of Zurich 22.5%, city of Zurich 18%, \"Z\u00fcrcher Kantonalbank\" 5%, city of Winterthur 3.6% and municipality of Kloten 0.9%).\nThe FIG took over projects that had been started and was thus able to hand over the completed \"shipyard I\" to Swissair for use as early as late autumn 1948, followed by offices for Swissair's technical departments, which were finally able to leave D\u00fcbendorf by the end of April 1949. Further workshops, the striking arched hangar and the \"Heating Centre I\" for the heat supply were completed by the end of 1949.\n\nBased on \"Project V\", the terminal building had already been designed as a convex building at the airport head in mid-1946. In the following four years, a total of 24 feasible airport project designs were submitted, before the FIG commissioned the construction of the airport according to plans by Alfred and Heinrich Oeschger in November 1950. At the beginning of 1951, the piling work for the terminal building began, the construction work took about two years. With the opening on 9 April 1953, the shanty town could be abandoned. The new building consisted of a central passenger wing, flanked by a restaurant and an office wing. In addition there was a spectator terrace of 200m length.\n\nThe first years of operation\nAs had been expected the construction costs had been significantly exceeded. Several metres of raised bog were removed and backfilled with material from the Holberg; the concrete area had also increased from the originally planned 420,000 m2 to a good 611,000 m2. In addition, the former weapons range area had to be searched for unexploded bombs, of which a total of 157 were found. The costs for \"Project IV\", estimated at CHF 59.5 million in 1946, had risen to CHF 106 million by the time the civil engineering works under \"Project VII\" were completed in July 1949. Both chambers of the Federal Assembly concluded the political review with the \"Federal Decree on the Payment of Additional Federal Contributions to the Construction of Zurich-Kloten Airport\" of 29 September 1949. The Federation contributed CHF 27.1 million and doubled its contribution to the air traffic control facilities. For its part, the Zurich Cantonal Council granted a supplementary credit on 13 February 1950. This was accepted by the voters on 7 May 1950 with 73,551 votes to 59,088 (yes share of 55.45%).\n\nThe new terminal opened in 1953 with a large air show that ran three days. In 1947, the airport handled 133,638 passengers on 12,766 airline flights; in 1952, 372,832 passengers on 24,728 airline flights.\n\nSecond stage of construction\nLocher & Cie was commissioned in 1954 to design various project options for the second construction phase. In March 1956, the canton submitted an extended project to the Federal Council. In addition to mandatory runway extensions for the incipient \"jet age\", the project also provided for the extension of the public facilities, which were already overused and dominated by various provisional arrangements; two finger docks were to defuse the situation. On 12 October 1956, the Federal Council recommended that parliament approve the bill. On 19 December 1956, the Council of States approved the federal contribution of CHF 54.8 million (at a total cost of 181.8 million), the National Council followed suit on 7 March 1957. The contribution of the Canton of Zurich of CHF 74.3 million was still outstanding, the rest was to be raised by FIG and Swissair. The concrete expansion project included the extension of the blind runway to 4000 m and the western runway to 3150 m, as well as the extension of the buildings. Opponents described the \"super airport Kloten\" as a \"luxury\" and criticised that the canton had \"lost every measure\". Another issue that planners had completely neglected until then was the aircraft noise. With a high turnout of 72.3%, the expansion project failed in the cantonal referendum of 23 June 1957 with 97,603 votes to 83,196 (no vote of 54.0%).\n\nJust four days later, the Zurich government council commissioned a redimensioned expansion project. The blind runway was to be only 3700 m long, the western runway 2500 m; the construction of the finger docks was abandoned. Thus the canton's share of the project to be approved was only CHF 49.1 million. The government gave far more attention to the aircraft noise. On 6 July 1958, voters approved the project by 107,050 votes to 56,872 (yes share 65.3%), with a 65.6% share. Due to time pressure - the landing of the first jet aircraft was planned for the following year - construction work began without waiting for approval of the federal funding. In December 1958 and March 1959 respectively, the National Council and the Council of States granted subsidies of 55.6 million. In 1959, BOAC started regular flight connections to Zurich with the revised \"Comet IV\", while the airport was still a construction site.\n\nThe first buildings were completed in 1960, and the terminal building, which had been considered an attractive design, lost its symmetrical appearance. To the east, towards the former shanty town, office wing A1, office wing B and the air traffic control building were added with a connecting structure. The \"Fracht West\" building, which had been extended at short notice during construction to provide additional office space, was located somewhat off the main building. In the hangar area in the southwest, Heating Station II was put into operation and the Hangar II, which was designed for jet aircraft, was handed over to Swissair, shortly after the arrival of the Sud Aviation \"Caravelle III\" and the Douglas DC-8-32 in May 1960. Finally, in the summer of 1961, Swissair's in-flight catering service was given a new building between the head of the airport and the hangar area.\n\nThe Canton of Zurich acquired a further 135 hectares of land for the expansion of the civil engineering works, which lasted until the beginning of 1961 in parallel with the construction of the buildings. The apron areas were enlarged, particularly at the airport head and in the hangar area; the pier was also extended from 16 to 28 aircraft parking spaces, and buses were purchased to provide access to them. The west runway 10/28 was extended by 600 metres to the west, towards R\u00fcmlang, and opened on 1 January 1961 with its new operating length of 2500 metres. Blind runway 16/34 was extended 400 metres to the south in the direction of Opfikon and 700 metres to the north in the direction of Oberglatt. At its new operating length of 3700 m, it was released on 15 March 1961. By the time work was completed, the paved area at the airport covered 1,013,000 m2.\n\nExtension of the Terminal Building\nAlthough virtually all the buildings of the second phase had been completed by the end of 1961, the extension of the terminal building was still at the design stage. After the passenger terminal with two finger docks had failed in the cantonal referendum, the FIG had worked out a new project until 1958. This envisaged a two-storey transverse hall on the landside of the airport, on the two main floors of which arriving and departing passengers were functionally separated. For cost reasons, the federal government demanded a considerable redimensioning, which led to an open dispute about the preferred design. When the conflict, described by the media as a \"war of experts\", threatened to escalate, President Willy Sp\u00fchler invited representatives of the Federation and the cantons to a conference on 9 December 1963.\n\nDuring the conference, FIG's airport planners and the Canton of Zurich prevailed against the federal government. The canton only had to make concessions for the commercial parts of the project, such as the restaurant wing. The dispatch of the Federal Council, submitted on 1 March 1965, requested a federal contribution of 23.1 million to the total costs of 129.4 million. Of this, 2.1 million was earmarked for the connection of the airport to the national road network and for the preparation of a connection to the planned (but never built) Zurich underground railway. The National Council and Council of States adopted the bill in October 1965, allowing construction work to begin the following year. The motorway loop was in operation from 1968. Finally, with the opening of the last new hall wing on 1 April 1971, the extension of the terminal building was completed.\n\nThe first signs of noise mitigation for the airport were in 1972, when a night-time curfew was enacted, as well as in 1974 when new approach routes were introduced. Runway 14/32 was opened in 1976, and 16/34 began renovation.\n\nAttacks on El Al aircraft\n\nOn 18 February 1969, four armed members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) attacked El Al flight 432, firing Kalashnikov assault rifles at the Boeing 720B whilst it prepared for takeoff. The Shin Bet employee Mordechai Rachamim fired back with his pistol and killed the terrorist Abdel Mohsen Hassan. The three remaining assassins were each sentenced to twelve years in prison. The aircraft's co-pilot subsequently died of his injuries.\n\nThe attack marked the beginning of a discussion about airport security that had never been raised until then in Switzerland. On 21 February 1970 a parcel bomb exploded in Swissair's Convair CV-990 on flight SR330 (Zurich-Tel Aviv). In the crash near W\u00fcrenlingen all 47 people on board were killed. Investigations revealed that a PFLP terrorist group had carried out the bomb attack. The actual target, however, had been an El Al flight from Munich to Tel Aviv, whose mail had been sent with Swissair to Zurich due to long delays. In 1970 the PFLP obtained the release of the three terrorists convicted in Switzerland and other comrades-in-arms imprisoned abroad through coordinated hijackings. Flights affected were SR 100 (Zurich-New York), TWA flight TW741, Pan Am flight PA93 and BOAC flight BA775.\n\nThird stage of construction\nIn January 1969, the Zurich Cantonal Council approved a loan for preparatory work for the third stage of expansion. The project that was subsequently drawn up clearly exceeded the previous dimensions. The plans included the extension of the existing runways, a 3300 m long runway, additional taxiways, the enlargement of the pier to 47 stands, a new terminal with finger dock, two multi-storey car parks, additional technical buildings, an airport railway station and a new hangar. In addition, there were various extensions and conversions of existing buildings. The costs were estimated at CHF 777.6 million (not including the air traffic control building and railway station). Since this project was hardly different from the \"super airport\" rejected in 1957, criticism was immediately voiced again by the \"Protection Association of the Population around Zurich Airport\" (SBFZ) and the community of H\u00f6ri, which was located directly in the approach corridor. The SBFZ even demanded the resumption of the central airport concept that was dropped in 1945 - instead of Utzenstorf this time in the \"Grosse Moos\", with two runways jutting into Lake Neuch\u00e2tel.\n\nThe supporters of the Zurich airport expansion argued primarily with the economic benefit. In order to take the wind out of the sails of aircraft noise criticism, the government and cantonal council are drafting an aircraft noise law (including a ban on night flights), which should be submitted to a referendum at the same time as the expansion bill. After the Cantonal Council had approved both bills in July 1970, the referendum was held on 27 September 1970. The proposal for expansion was approved by 103,867 votes to 64,192 (61.8% yes), the Aircraft Noise Act by 134,501 votes to 32,590 (80.5% yes). The following year, the Federal Assembly approved a federal contribution of 240.3 million. Construction work on the third stage also began in 1971. In 1973, Hangar III, Cargo Hall East, Car Park F and the General Aviation Centre were completed. In 1974 the \"Werkhof\" (work yard), an office building and multistorey car park E were added, in 1975 the apron, multi-storey car park B and Terminal B with finger dock, and in 1976 the Airport Plaza shopping and service centre located in multi-storey car park B.\n\nAdditional costs were incurred due to numerous adjustments to the construction project. The additional credit of 25.8 million was accepted by Zurich voters on 7 December 1975 with 178,723 to 87,303 votes (67.2% yes). The canton supplemented this credit with ordinary and extraordinary budget credits from the building department. In March 1976 the Federal Assembly approved an additional federal contribution of 39.7 million.\nAs the centrepiece of the third stage, runway 14/32 was opened on 1 April 1976, increasing capacity by a third. In the early days, the new runway served exclusively for landing traffic. The rail link, which had been approved by parliament in 1975 in a separate federal decree, was still outstanding. As this was a project of the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB), the cost allocation differed greatly. Of the total costs of 285 million, the SBB contributed 60%, the Federation 33% and the Canton of Zurich 7%. The project comprised the Zurich Airport railway station under Terminal B (on which construction had been underway since 1971) and a new line between Bassersdorf and Glattbrugg. After nine years of construction, the ceremonial opening of the airport line took place on 29 May 1980.\n\nFourth stage of construction\nIn the second half of the 1970s, the volume of traffic continued to rise sharply, so the Canton of Zurich, the FIG and Swissair worked out a project for the fourth construction phase. On 28 September 1980, with 142,240 to 104,775 votes (57.6%), Zurich voters accepted a loan of CHF 48 million for civil engineering works, which were part of the forthcoming construction work.\n\nAlso in 1980, the Federal Office of Civil Aviation published a new airport concept, which replaced that of 1945. The focus was now on qualitative expansion, taking into account spatial planning and environmental protection considerations.\n\nBased on this concept, the Federal Assembly approved the \"Building Programme 1981-1985\". This programme provided for investments of CHF 393.3 million in Zurich-Kloten, but the subsidy contribution of 10.3% was significantly lower than for the Geneva and Basel-Mulhouse airports. This was justified by the catch-up demand of the two other major Swiss airports.\nThe central element of the fourth stage was the finger dock in Terminal A with 13 docking positions. Also planned were a new control tower, a baggage sorting system, an additional multi-storey car park, waiting rooms and an operations centre for aircraft crews. Later, the Zurich government council also decided to renew the damaged western runway, which had to be closed for two and a half months in the summer of 1985 for this purpose. Fingerdock A was put into operation on 1 November 1985, the new 41 m high control tower on 29 April 1986.\nThere were also plans to expand the airport's cargo facilities. However, a corresponding loan of CHF 57 million was narrowly rejected in the referendum of 6 September 1987 by 106,722 to 98,663 votes (52.0% against).\nThe project, which was subsequently revised and approved by the Zurich Cantonal Council in 1989, focused on more efficient use of the existing facilities, thereby enabling the handling of an additional 100,000 tonnes of freight annually.\n\nFifth stage of construction (\"Airport 2000\")\nThe cantonal popular initiative \"for moderate air traffic\" submitted in January 1991 intended to limit the airport to its then status, i.e. neither to allow more aircraft movements nor to expand the infrastructure. In the vote of 26 September 1993, however, it did not stand a chance and was clearly rejected by 235,531 votes to 112,476 (67.6%).\nNine months later, the Zurich cantonal government submitted a proposal for a loan of CHF 873 million to the cantonal council. The fifth construction phase, known as \"Airport 2000\" and costing a total of CHF 2.4 billion, was intended to replace outdated systems and further expand existing facilities. At the heart of the project was the construction of a third terminal, Dock E \"Midfield\", located between the three runways. The Skymetro aerial tramway, a road tunnel and underground baggage conveyors were necessary for its development. Also part of the fifth stage was the construction of the new passenger hub \"Airside Center\". The Cantonal Council approved the project at the end of February 1995.\nIt cleared the last hurdle in the referendum of 25 June 1995, when it was approved by 224,668 votes to 105,859 (68.0% Yes).\nAfter almost nine years of construction, the project was completed in 2004.\n\n\"Zurich 2010\" project\nThe next major event for the airport was in 1999, when the Parliament of the canton of Z\u00fcrich approved privatization of Zurich Airport. The following year, Flughafen Z\u00fcrich AG, trading under the brand Unique, became the new airport operator. The company dropped the brand Unique in favour of Zurich Airport and Flughafen Z\u00fcrich in 2010.\n\nOn 2 October 2001, a major cash-flow crisis at Swissair, exacerbated by the global downturn in air travel caused by the September 11 attacks, caused the airline to ground all its flights. Although a government rescue plan permitted some flights to restart a few days later, and the airline's assets were subsequently sold to become Swiss International Air Lines, the airport lost a large volume of traffic. After Lufthansa took control of Swiss International Air Lines in 2005, traffic began to grow again.\n\nOn 18 October 2001, Germany and Switzerland signed a treaty regarding the limitation of flights over Germany. Under the terms of this treaty, any incoming aircraft after 22:00 had to approach Z\u00fcrich from the east to land on runway 28, which, unlike the airport's other runways, was not equipped with an instrument landing system. A month later, at 22:06 on 24 November, an inbound Crossair Avro RJ100 using this approach in conditions of poor visibility crashed into a range of hills near Bassersdorf and exploded, killing 24 of the 33 people on board. The flight had originally been scheduled to land on runway 14 before 22:00, but it was subject to delay and was therefore diverted to runway 28.\n\nZurich Airport completed a major expansion project in 2003, in which it built a new parking garage, a new midfield terminal, and an automated underground people mover to link the midfield terminal to the main terminal. In November 2008 a complete renovation and rebuild of the old terminal B structure was announced. The new terminal B opened in November 2011, and provides segregated access to and from aircraft for Schengen and non-Schengen passengers. Zurich Airport handled 25.5 million passengers in 2014, up 2.5 percent from 2013.\n\nEtihad Regional ceased on 18 February 2015 to fly two-thirds of its scheduled routes without further notice, amongst them all its services from Z\u00fcrich except the domestic service to Geneva. Etihad Regional blamed the failure of its expansion on the behavior of competitors, especially Swiss International Air Lines, as well as the Swiss aviation authorities.\n\nFollowing the demolition of some office buildings the construction of the new baggage sorting facilities between the Operations Center and Terminal 1 began in spring 2018 with a total investment of CHF 500 million.\n\nAs of 2020, the marketing of all advertising space at the airport was transferred from Clear Channel to APG.\n\nThe main Terminal 1 will be completely rebuilt - including the tower of the Skyguide Air Traffic Control. Construction is scheduled to begin in 2021, with completion expected in 2030. In addition to the old building fabric, the expected growth in passenger numbers is the main reason for the pending construction work. \"The forecasts suggest that the number of passengers arriving, departing or transferring at Zurich Airport each year today will grow from 29 million today to 50 million by 2030,\" says the airport operator's personnel booklet.\n\nCorporate affairs\nThe airport is owned by Flughafen Z\u00fcrich AG, a company quoted on the SIX Swiss Exchange. Major shareholders include the canton of Z\u00fcrich, with 33.33% plus one of the shares, and the city of Z\u00fcrich, with 5% of the shares. No other shareholder has a holding exceeding 3%. Flughafen Z\u00fcrich AG used the brand name Unique from 2000 until 2010.\n\nThe company has stakes in various other airports around the world.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nTerminal complex\nThe airport has three airside piers, which are known as terminals A, B, and E (also signposted as Gates A, B/D, and E). These are linked to a central air-side building called Airside Center, built in 2003. Alongside the Airside Center, the ground-side terminal complex named Airport Center comprises several buildings, and includes airline check-in areas, a shopping mall, a railway station, car parks, and a bus and tram terminal. All departing passengers access the same departure level of the Airside Center, which includes duty-free shopping and various bars and restaurants, via airport security. They are then segregated between passengers for Schengen and non-Schengen destinations on the way to the gate lounges, with the latter first passing through emigration controls. Arriving Schengen and non-Schengen passengers are handled in separate areas of the Airside Center and reach it by different routes, with non-Schengen passengers first passing through immigration controls. The three airside terminals are:\n\nTerminal A \nTerminal A contains gates prefixed A. It opened in 1971, and it is used exclusively by flights to and from destinations inside the Schengen Area, including domestic flights within Switzerland. Since its expansion in 1982\u20131985, it takes the form of a finger pier, directly connected at one end to the Airside Centre.\n\nTerminal A was scheduled to be torn down and replaced by an entirely new facility from 2021. However in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic the start of the project has been postponed for at least three years.\n\nTerminal B \nTerminal B contains gates prefixed B and D. It opened in 1975 and reopened in November 2011 after an extensive three-year reconstruction. Like terminal A, it takes the form of a finger pier directly connected at one end to the Airside Centre. Since reconstruction, it can accommodate both Schengen and non-Schengen flights at the same gates. Each gate has two numbers, one prefixed B and the other D, but with different passenger routes to and from the gates to separate the flows of Schengen and non-Schengen passengers.\n\nTerminal E \nTerminal E contains gates prefixed E, and is also known as the midfield terminal or Dock E. It is a stand-alone satellite terminal located on the opposite side of runway 10/28 from the Airside Center, and is situated between runways 16/34 and 14/32. It is entirely used by non-Schengen international flights and became operational and was opened on September 1, 2003. It is connected to the Airside Center by the Skymetro, an automated underground people mover.\n\nRunways\nZurich Airport has three runways: 16/34 of  in length, 14/32 of  in length, and 10/28 of  in length. For most of the day and in most conditions, runway 14 is used for landings and runways 16 and 28 are used for takeoffs, although different patterns are used early morning and in the evenings.\n\nAirlines and destinations\n\nThe following airlines offer regular scheduled and charter flights at Zurich Airport:\n\n{{Airport-dest-list \n\n|Aegean Airlines| Athens, ThessalonikiSeasonal: Heraklion, Rhodes\n\n| Aer Lingus | Dublin\n\n| Aeroflot | Moscow\u2013Sheremetyevo\n\n| Air Albania | Seasonal: Kuk\u00ebs\n\n|Air Cairo| Seasonal: Hurghada\n\n| Air Canada | Toronto\u2013PearsonSeasonal: Vancouver\n\n| Air Corsica | Seasonal: Ajaccio (begins 2 July 2022)\n\n| Air Europa | Madrid\n\n| Air France | Paris\u2013Charles de Gaulle\n\n| Air Malta | Malta\n\n| Air Serbia | Belgrade\n\n| airBaltic | Riga\n\n| AlMasria Universal Airlines | Seasonal charter: Hurghada<ref name=\"abouttravel.ch\">\n\nStatistics\n\nBusiest routes\n\nTop airlines\n\nPassenger development\n\nGround transportation\n\nTrain\nZ\u00fcrich Flughafen railway station is located underneath the Airport Centre. The station has frequent Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn services, plus direct InterRegio, InterCity, and Eurocity services, to many places including Basel, Bern, Biel/Bienne, Brig, Geneva, Konstanz, Lausanne, Lucerne, Munich, Romanshorn, St. Gallen, and Winterthur. There are some 13 trains per hour to Z\u00fcrich HB (Hauptbahnhof), Z\u00fcrich's main city centre station, with a journey time of between 9 and 13 minutes. By changing trains there, most other places in Switzerland can be reached in a few hours.\n\nBus and tram\nIn front of the Airport Centre is the airport stop of the Stadtbahn Glattal, a light rail system that interworks with the Z\u00fcrich tram system, together with a regional bus station. Both the bus station and light rail stop provide service to destinations throughout the Glattal region that surrounds the airport, with the light rail stop being served by tram routes 10 and 12. Tram route 10 also provides a link to Zurich Hauptbahnhof, albeit with a rather longer journey time than that of the railway.\n\nRoad\nThe airport is served by the A51 motorway and other main roads, which link to the airport's own road network. Drop-off areas are available by the Airport Centre whilst a total of over 14000 spaces are available in six car parks for short and long term parking. A car hire centre is located in the terminal complex. The airport is served by a fleet of dedicated airport taxis, which operate from taxi ranks in front of the arrival areas. Alternative chauffeur driven airport limousines can be arranged.\nThe airport can legally be reached by bicycle on a regional highway (Flughafenstrasse and Birchstrasse) that branches off national highway 4 (Schaffhausen - B\u00fclach - Z\u00fcrich - Luzern) just east of the airport and reaches Northwestern Z\u00fcrich.\n\nOther facilities\n\nThe Circle\nThe Circle, a complex intended to include a medical center, a conference center, shops, restaurants, offices, and hotels, is under construction opposite the Airport Centre. In February 2009, Flughafen Z\u00fcrich AG (FZAG) launched a three-stage architectural competition for \"The Circle at Zurich Airport\" development. Around 180,000 square meters of usable space for services were to be built close to the terminals on a 37,000 square meter site. Two hotels and the congress area will occupy around 45,000 square meters, which will be operated by the Hyatt Corporation. At the end of October 2011, FZAG submitted the building application to the town of Kloten, which granted the building permit on 6 March 2012. The groundbreaking ceremony for the superstructure, scheduled for the end of 2013, was postponed until the beginning of 2015. The Circle\" is expected to create around 5,000 new jobs, with an investment volume of around CHF 1 billion. The foundation stone was laid on 24 March 2017 and the opening is expected to take place in the first half of 2020; however, even then not all six parts of the building will be ready. In the meantime, it has been announced that the opening will take place in September 2020.\n\nCompany headquarters\nSeveral companies have their headquarters on or about the airport. These include Swiss International Air Lines, Swiss World Cargo, Swiss AviationTraining, Edelweiss Air, gategroup, Helvetic Airways, Swiss\u00f4tel, and Rega. Other companies that were formerly based on the airport include Swissair  and Crossair.\n\nSafety and environment\n\nAirport fire department\nThe airport fire brigade is responsible for fire-fighting at Zurich Airport and is on standby around the clock. In the event of an emergency, the brigade must be able to reach any location on the airport grounds, an area of 880 hectares, in no more than three minutes in accordance with international standards. Their vehicles have extremely powerful engines and large-capacity tanks.\n\nThe fire service also includes an operations control centre. This not only coordinates the airport's rescue services, but also alerts the fire brigades in the northern part of the canton. A total of 77 fire brigades are deployed from the Operations Control Centre, including 2 professional and 13 base fire brigades. Likewise, the rescue service Schutz und Rettung Z\u00fcrich Nord, the rescue service Spital B\u00fclach, the rescue service Winterthur and since April 1, 2008, the rescue service of the canton of Schaffhausen are also dispatched. Other tasks of the Operations Control Centre include alerting a large animal rescue service, a personal emergency call and location system and the coordination of the emergency medical service for several municipalities. In addition, 3800 fire alarm criteria are accumulated in the operations control centre. Every year, the operations control centre receives about 150,000 telephone calls.\n\nUntil 31 December 2007, the airport fire brigade was officially called the Berufsfeuerwehr Flughafen Z\u00fcrich (Professional Fire Brigade), and it was constituted as the company fire brigade of Flughafen Z\u00fcrich AG. On 1 January 2008, the airport fire brigade, together with the rescue service and the operations control centre, was for organizational reasons transferred to the Schutz und Rettung (Protection and Rescue) department of the city of Zurich.\n\nThe airport fire brigade records more than 1000 operations per year. In 2004, 260 of these involved incidents involving aircraft, including emergency or safety landings.\n\nRefuelling dispenser, Ramp Safety, Airport Authority and Follow Me\nVehicles that not only cross taxiways and runways reserved for aircraft on the designated roads, but also use them for business purposes, must be equipped with a transponder and radio and can thus be tracked on tracking websites (e.g. Flightradar24). The transponder sign or radio name for the Follow-Me vehicles is Zebra.\n\nIn 2014, five companies were licensed for aircraft refuelling at the airport, operating 16 tankers and 28 dispensers.\n\nRescue service Zurich Airport\nThe rescue service at Zurich Airport was established around 1982 as the original \"fire-fighting ambulance\". Its primary purpose was to protect fire-fighting personnel during fire-fighting operations, and secondarily to provide medical care for injured passengers. It was quickly recognised that there was also a steadily growing need for rescue services for the population outside the airport, and often neighbouring hospitals that were able to provide this service could not cope due to capacity bottlenecks, or the corresponding structures were not available in the Z\u00fcrcher Unterland at the time. When the airport was privatized in 2000 to form the public limited company Unique (Flughafen Z\u00fcrich AG), the rescue service was then separated from the fire service as a separate division within the Safety&Security department.\n\nIn the last year of its existence in 2007, the Rescue Service at Zurich Airport carried out around 5800 missions with 36 paramedics and three trainees. The majority of the operations were carried out in the region around the airport, which at that time comprised 28 contractual communities. There were three ambulances on standby during the day and two ambulances at night, which was carried out in two shifts of twelve hours each. The teams were on duty four times a day (twice a day and twice at night). As a novelty, Zurich Airport Emergency Medical Services consistently applied the amended labor law, i.e. it was one of the few employers to fully credit the working time of twelve hours without deductions (\"attendance time\"/effective working time).\n\nThere was no permanently installed emergency medical system at the airport site. The paramedics are equipped with extended skills that allow the administration of medication according to algorithms. As part of a quality control of the measures carried out, all operations were checked by the Medical Director. At the same time, an annual review of medication and algorithmic knowledge took place. Only after passing the written and practical test was the paramedic authorized to administer medication for another year. If an emergency physician was needed, the resources of the partner organisations REGA (helicopters) or the NEF of \"Schutz und Rettung Z\u00fcrich\" could be called upon.\n\nProject SUS After two project studies, Unique (Flughafen Z\u00fcrich AG) decided in the summer of 2007 to outsource the rescue service together with the operations centre and the professional fire brigade and to sell it to the Schutz und Rettung (Protection and Rescue) department of the city of Zurich for an amount of CHF 22 million. This was also due to the needs of the city of Zurich, as its professional fire brigade in particular had problems meeting the required arrival times with long journeys to the north of the city of Zurich. At the same time, it was possible to avoid the cost-intensive construction of a new base for rescue services and fire brigades in the rapidly growing north. A comprehensive contract was drawn up for the takeover of the entire department, which will be reassessed after ten years. The outsourcing resulted in massive internal restructuring, which replaced the previous organisational form. Since January 1, 2008, the base at the airport has been known as the \"Wache Nord\". With a strong positive operating result in 2007 and a reduced staffing level as of January 1, 2008, the catchment area of the rescue service expanded to include the northern districts of Zurich Schwamendingen, Seebach and Oerlikon.\n\nAccidents and incidents \n On November 24, 1951, a Douglas DC-4 of the Israeli El Al (aircraft registration 4X-ADN) on a cargo flight from Rome with textiles on board crashed into a forest three kilometers northeast of Zurich Airport shortly before landing. Six of the seven crew members were killed.\n On 24 November 1956, an Ilyushin Il-12B of the Czechoslovak airline \u010cSA (OK-DBP) crashed into an agricultural area 13 kilometres after take-off from Zurich-Kloten airport, only 500 metres from the southern outskirts of Wasterkingen, probably due to engine problems. All 23 passengers and crew members died there.\n On 4 September 1963, Swissair Flight 306 experienced an in-flight fire shortly after take-off and crashed, killing all 80 people on board.\n On 18 February 1969, four armed members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine attacked El Al flight 432 whilst it prepared for takeoff. The aircraft's security guard repelled the attack, resulting in the death of one of the terrorists, whilst the Boeing 720's co-pilot subsequently died of his injuries.\n On 21 February 1970, a barometrically triggered bomb exploded on Swissair Flight 330 some nine minutes after takeoff from Zurich en route to Tel Aviv and Hong Kong. All 47 occupants were killed. The bombing was attributed to the PFLP-GC.\n On 18 January 1971, an inbound Balkan Bulgarian Airlines Il-18D approached Zurich Airport in fog below the glideslope. It crashed and burst into flames,  north of the airport, when both left wingtip and landing gear contacted the ground. Seven crew members and 38 passengers were killed.\n On 24 November 1990, an Alitalia Douglas DC-9 operating Flight 404 crashed on approach to Zurich, killing all 46 passengers and crew on board.\n On 10 January 2000, a Crossair Saab 340 operating Flight 498 crashed shortly after takeoff, killing all 10 occupants. The cause of the crash was determined to have been the result of spatial disorientation and pilot errors.\n On 24 November 2001, a Crossair Avro RJ100 operating Flight 3597 crashed into hills near Bassersdorf while on approach to Zurich. Twenty-four of the 33 people on board were killed.\n On 15 March 2011, two Swiss A320s received almost simultaneous take-off clearance on the intersecting runways 16 and 28. In response to this serious incident, the Federal Office of Civil Aviation commissioned a comprehensive analysis of the operating procedures.\n On 27 September 2013 the nose landing gear of a De Havilland DHC-8-400 of Croatia Airlines could not be extended. The aircraft had taken off in Zagreb and was scheduled to land in Zurich. During the landing approach to Zurich Airport the pilots noticed that the nose gear of the aircraft was not extended. They tried for 40 minutes to extend the landing gear completely, but failed. The pilots decided to make an emergency landing in Zurich on runway 14, and none of the 60 passengers were injured in the subsequent landing at 8:17 pm. Runway 14 was then closed until the end of operations. After 15 minutes, air traffic on the two other runways could be resumed as usual.\n\nSee also\n Transport in Switzerland\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Official website\n Ski Taxi & Airport Transfers\n \n \n \n\nAirports in Switzerland\nAirports established in 1948\nBuildings and structures in the canton of Z\u00fcrich\nKloten\nTransport in the canton of Z\u00fcrich\n1948 establishments in Switzerland", "machine_text": "Zurich Airport, also known as Zurich International Airport, is Switzerland's largest airport and is located in the city of Kloten, just eight kilometers north of the city center of Zurich.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Two-way communication\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Two-way communication is a form of transmission in which both parties involved transmit information. Two-way communication has also been referred to as interpersonal communication. Common forms of two-way communication are:\n Amateur radio, CB or FRS radio contacts.\n Chatrooms and instant messaging.\n Computer networks. See backchannel.\n In-person communication.\n Telephone conversations.\n\nA cycle of communication and two-way communication are actually two different things. If we examine closely the anatomy of communication \u2013 the actual structure and parts \u2013 we will discover that a cycle of communication is not a two-way communication in its entirety. Meaning, two way communication is not as simple as one may infer. One can improve two-way or interpersonal communication by focusing on the eyes of the person speaking, making eye contact, watching body language, responding appropriately with comments, questions, and paraphrasing, and summarizing to confirm main points and an accurate understanding.\n\nTwo-way communication is different from one-way communication in that two-way communication occurs when the receiver provides feedback to the sender. One-way communication is when a message flows from sender to receiver only, thus providing no feedback. Some examples of one-way communication are radio or television programs and listening to policy statements from top executives. Two-way communication is especially significant in that it enables feedback to improve a situation.\n\nTwo-way communication involves feedback from the receiver to the sender. This allows the sender to know the message was received accurately by the receiver. Communication is also negotiated which means that the sender and receiver listen to each other, the messages then gathers information to respond.  One person is the sender, which means they send a message to another person via face to face, email, telephone, etc. The other person is the receiver, which means they are the one getting the senders message. Once receiving the message, the receiver sends a response back. For example, Person A sends an email to Person B --> Person B responds with their own email back to Person A. The cycle then continues.\nThis chart demonstrates two-way communication and feedback.\n\n                        [Sender] \u2190-------\n                           |                 \\\n                      [Encoding]               \\\n                           |                    |\n                       [Channel]         [Feedback]\n                           |                    |\n                      [Decoding]               /\n                           |                 /\n                      [Receiver]---------->\n\nTwo-way communication may occur horizontally or vertically in the organization. When information is exchanged between superior and subordinate, it is known as vertical two-way communication. On the other hand, when communication takes place between persons holding the same rank or position, it is called horizontal two-way communication. Two-way communication is represented in the following diagrams:                  \n\n                     (Superior)---------------> (Subordinate)---------------> (Superior)\n                                (Information)                  (Feedback)\n\nThere are many different types of two-way communication systems, and choosing which is best to use depends on things like the intended use, the location, the number of users, the frequency band, and the cost of the system. \u201cRegardless of the type of system chosen, the one common feature is that all of the components must be compatible and work together to support a common purpose.\u201d\n\nAmateur radio, citizen band radio, and Family Radio Service \nAmateur radio is used for entertainment and as a hobby by many groups of people. These individuals label themselves as \u201chams\u201d. Amateur radios are also known to be a reliable means of communication when all other forms are not operating. In times of disaster, communication through Amateur radios has led to lives being saved.\nCitizens band radio (CB radio) can be used by anyone who is not a member of a foreign government. It is meant for short-range communication using devices that mimic walkie-talkies.\nFamily Radio Service (FRS) is also meant for short-range communication using devices that mimic walkie-talkies. Like the CB radio, the FRS does not require a license and can be used by anyone who is not a member of a foreign government.\n\nChat rooms and instant messaging \nInstant messaging became wildly popular around 1996 and spread even more with AOL in 1997. The concept behind IM is that it is a way of quick communication between two people due to tools such as knowing when messages are seen or knowing when others are online. Many social media sites have integrated IM into their sites as ways to spread communication. Chat rooms are very similar, only they are messages to a group of people. Chat rooms are often public, meaning that you can send a message and anyone can freely join the \u201croom\u201d and view the message as well as respond.\n\nIn-person communication \nAs it relates to business, 75% of people believe in-person communication is critical. In-person interaction is useful for resolving problems more efficiently, generating long-term relationships, and resolving a problem or creating an opportunity quickly. 4 out of 6 of the most important attributes of building a relationship cannot be achieved without the power of in-person, which requires a rich communication environment. Business executives believe in-person collaboration is critical for more than 50 percent of key business strategic and tactical business processes when engaging with colleagues, customers, or partners.\n\nTelephone conversations \nThe telephone is a device that is relatively easy to understand and use. The telephone connections used today have remained remarkably unchanged compared to those used almost a century ago. A connection to the phone company is rather straightforward as well. The telephone makes it easy to connect instantly with others from all over the world, making it simple to have a two-way conversation with a neighbor or with someone many miles away. Phones have undergone some changes over the years. Today, for example, phones use electronic switches instead of operators. The switch uses a dial tone so that when one picks up the phone you are aware that both the switch and the phone are functioning properly.\n\nComputer networks \nComputer networks are used to have two-way communication by having computers exchange data.  Ways that this is possible is wired interconnects and wireless interconnects.  Types of wired interconnects are Ethernets and fiber optic cables. Ethernets connect local devices through Ethernet cables. Fiber runs underground for long distances and is the main source of Internet in most homes and businesses. Types of wireless interconnects include Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.  The problem with these networks is that they don't have unlimited connection span. To expand the reach there are wide area interconnects such as satellite and cellular networks.  Also, there are long-distance interconnects which need backhaul to move the data back and forth and last mile to connect the provider to the network.\n\nReferences \n\nCommunication\nHuman communication\nTelecommunications techniques", "machine_text": "Two-way communication, sometimes referred to as interactive communication, is a process in which both parties involved are able to exchange information with each other. It is an important mode of communication in both personal and professional settings. Two-way communication creates a dialogue between individuals, allowing for a deeper understanding of issues and the exchange of ideas. In business, two-way communication is essential for success. It allows for employees to give and receive feedback, which can improve job performance and overall productivity. Effective two-way communication can also build stronger relationships between colleagues and between employers and their staff. This can lead to a more positive work environment and greater job satisfaction. In personal relationships, two-way communication is crucial for building and maintaining connections. Being able to listen and respond to one another\u2019s thoughts, feelings, and concerns is important for building mutual respect and trust. It can also help prevent misunderstandings and conflicts. Two-way communication can take many different forms, including verbal (such as face-to-face conversations or phone calls), written (emails or letters), or digital (text messages or online chats). Effective two-way communication requires active listening, clear and concise messaging, and a willingness to be open and honest. In addition, two-way communication can also occur through nonverbal cues such as body language or facial expressions. These cues often convey emotions and attitudes that might not be expressed through language alone. Overall, two-way communication is an important tool for personal and professional growth. By fostering open dialogue and mutual understanding, we can build stronger relationships, make better decisions, and achieve greater success.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 350172}

The Veena is classified as a zither, and the modern version consists of a long hollow neck made of wood, with a resonating chamber of gourd or tumba attached to it. The instrument has 24 frets made of brass or silver and is played by plucking the strings with the fingertips of the right hand while the left hand adjusts the tension of the strings to create different notes.

It was built between 1878 and 1880 in a geometric Neo-Gothic style designed by Robert Baldie. The church included a nave and gable-fronted Aisles. An organ by Abbott and Smith was installed in 1912.\n\nUpon union with the Church of Scotland in 1929, the church was renamed Govanhill West Church, to distinguish it from Govanhill South Church. Both congregations united in 1952 to form Govanhill Parish Church using the church building in Daisy Street. In 1989, the congregation of the now demolished Candlish Polmadie Church (formerly Candlish Memorial Church), united with the Govanhill congregation forming Govanhill Trinity Parish Church.

The WFLB studios are located east of downtown Fayetteville, and its transmitter is located north of Lumberton, North Carolina.\n\nHistory\nWEWO-FM began in Laurinburg in 1947, a sister station to WEWO. Don Curtis purchased the stations in 1968, and WEWO-FM became a Christian radio station called WSTS, The station received a power increase to 100,000 watts to reach Fayetteville. Durham Life Broadcasting later bought the stations.\n\nIn 1989, WSTS dropped religious programming and became CHR WMXF \"Mix 96\" Dale O'Brian, former Program Director/Morning host at WKSI in Greensboro was hired as Program Director of MIX 96. He brought in talent from the Greensboro market and the station did very well. The airstaff was arguably the best in the market. The lineup included Dale O'Brian and Tank Sherman on mornings, Leah Scott on Mid-days, Pete Moss in Afternoons, Joe Mama Nights and Sammy Simpson late nights. The station created great street buzz and was very visible in the Fayetteville market. The WSTS letters and a similar format moved to a station in Fairmont. Durham Life sold its radio stations, and Curtis once again owned the 96.5 frequency, as well as other Durham Life stations.\n\nOn April 1, 1993, WMXF began stunting with a loop of \"Louie, Louie\" by The Kingsmen, changing the station's name temporarily to \"Louis 96.5.\" The real format turned out to be \"Oldies 96.5,\" and the call letters changed to WAZZ.\n\nBeasley Broadcasting bought WAZZ in the mid-90s, along with WFLB, the former Top 40 station in Fayetteville. Beasley gave WAZZ and WFLB each other's callsigns. The AM began broadcasting February 18, 1948, on 1490\u00a0kHz with 250 watts of power. The station was operated by Fayetteville Broadcasters Inc.\n\nOn December 30, 2005, Oldies 96.5 changed to classic hits as 96.5 the Drive. Program director Dave Stone described the difference this way: oldies included Buddy Holly and Elvis Presley, while classic hits focuses on the 70s and artists such as the Eagles and the Doobie Brothers.\n\nOn March 14, 2011 WFLB changed their format to adult hits, branded as \"Bob FM\" The final song as 96.5 The Drive was Elton John's Funeral for a Friend. The first songs as 96.5 Bob FM were The Gap Band's You Dropped a Bomb on Me and R.E.M.'s Losing My Religion.  While the station initially used the slogan \u201cwe play everything\u201d along with a wide variety of music from the 1960s through 2000s, the station has since shifted to a classic hits format, emphasizing pop and rock hits from the 1970s and 1980s, with occasional hits from the 1990s.\n\nOn November 1, 2019, WFLB changed to a holiday music format, ending their regular music format temporarily until Christmas 2019.\n\nExpiration of License \nOn September 1, 2019, at 8:33 AM EDT, a message played on an ad break during a rerun of Casey Kasem's American Top 40 that the Federal Communications Commission warned listeners that on December 1, 2019, that users may not be able to listen to WFLB anymore. On December 1, 2019, Beasley Broadcasting Group, the parent company of WFLB, has renewed its license with the FCC, extending the tenure of the radio station for another 7 years, now ending in 2026.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nFLB\nBob FM stations\nFLB", "machine_text": "WFLB (96.5 FM) is a radio station licensed to Laurinburg, North Carolina.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Charlie Haas\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Charles Doyle Haas II (born March 27, 1972) is an American professional and former amateur wrestler. He is best known for his time in World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) from 2000-2009 and Ring of Honor (ROH) from 2010-2013. In WWE he was a member of Team Angle, which later became a Tag Team duo with Shelton Benjamin known as \"The World's Greatest Tag Team\".\n\nHaas was an amateur wrestler in high school, and attended Seton Hall University on a wrestling scholarship, before becoming a stockbroker. He became a professional wrestler in 1996, and regularly teamed with his brother, Russ, with the two winning numerous championships on the independent circuit, including the CZW World Tag Team Championship and the JAPW Tag Team Championship. After signing contracts with WWE, The Haas Brothers were assigned to WWE's developmental territories, where they won the MCW Southern Tag Team Championship on three occasions. After Russ died in 2001 due to a heart attack, Haas began wrestling in singles competition, winning the HWA Heavyweight Championship once.\n\nHaas formed a team with Shelton Benjamin and the two debuted on SmackDown in December 2002. They won the WWE Tag Team Championship twice, and dubbed themselves The World's Greatest Tag Team before they split in 2004. Haas won the WWE Tag Team Championship once more with Rico, and gained Miss Jackie, whom he later married, as a valet. Haas then transferred into singles competition before being released from WWE in 2005. After a short stint in Jersey All Pro Wrestling (JAPW) and other independent promotions, Haas was re-signed to WWE in April 2006. He formed a short-lived team with Viscera, before reforming the World's Greatest Tag Team with Benjamin. After Benjamin transferred to the ECW brand, Haas began wrestling with a comical luchador persona, before developing a character where he imitated other wrestlers and WWE Hall of Famers. In addition, Haas won the last match on WWE Heat when the show ended on May 30, 2008.\n\nHaas was released from WWE in February 2010. He soon returned to the independent circuit, including returning to JAPW and appearing for Ring of Honor. In September 2010, he won the NWA Texas Heavyweight Championship. On April 1, 2011, Haas and Benjamin won the ROH World Tag Team Championship and held it until December 2011. Haas announced his retirement from professional wrestling in March 2013, but returned to competition in August that same year. Aside from wrestling, Haas and his then-wife Jackie ran a nutritional store, Custom Muscle Nutrition and Smoothie Shop, in Frisco, Texas, which they opened in October 2008 but has since closed.\n\nProfessional wrestling career\n\nEarly career (1996\u20132000) \n\nAfter debuting in 1996 as a professional wrestler, Haas regularly teamed with his brother Russ for numerous independent promotions. On July 22, 1998, The Haas Brothers won the Jersey All Pro Wrestling Tag Team Championship by defeating The Skin Head Express. They lost it to The Nation of Immigration just over a month later on August 25. They won the championship for the second time on May 21, 1999, by defeating The Big Unit (Rick Silver and Dave Desire), and held the championship until February 25, 2000 when they were defeated by Da Hit Squad. During 2000 they also held the Pennsylvania Championship Wrestling Tag Team Championship and the ECWA Tag Team Championship in the East Coast Wrestling Association promotion, which they won by defeating The Backseat Boyz (Trent Acid and Johnny Kashmere).\n\nThe Haas brothers began competing for Combat Zone Wrestling (CZW) in November 1999, losing to The King Pinz at The War Begins on November 20, 1999. They competed regularly for CZW throughout early 2000, and won the CZW World Tag Team Championship on February 12 at Climbing The Ladder by defeating The Kashmerino Brothers and The Thrill Kill Kult in a three-way match. On July 10, they lost the championship to The Backseat Boyz at Caged To The End, when Johnny Kashmere defeated Russ in a singles match and was awarded the championship.\n\nWorld Wrestling Federation / World Wrestling Entertainment (2000\u20132005) \n\nAfter a World Wrestling Federation (WWF) tryout match at Madison Square Garden on August 7, 2000, they signed a developmental contract with WWF. The two worked their way through the tag ranks in the WWF's developmental territories, Memphis Championship Wrestling (MCW) and the Heartland Wrestling Association (HWA). The brothers won the MCW Southern Tag Team Championship three times during early 2001, defeating The Dupps the first time and The Island Boyz and Joey Matthews and Christian York in a three-way match on both the second and third occasions. Russ died from a heart attack due to a pre-existing heart condition, on December 15, 2001 at age 27. The brothers fought in house shows and dark matches in the WWF up until Russ died. After Russ' death, Charlie continue to fight in dark matches. After Russ' death as a tribute to him, Haas wrote Russ' name on his wrist tape, and used the name \"R.C. Haas\" (standing for Russ\u2013Charlie) before being called up to the main WWE roster. On January 2, 2002, Haas won the HWA Heavyweight Championship, his first singles championship, by defeating Val Venis. He was later stripped of the title on January 29 due to a scripted contract loophole. After World Wrestling Entertainment (renamed from the WWF) ended its affiliation with the HWA, Haas was moved to Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) where he competed until December 2002.\n\nHaas debuted on WWE's main roster on the December 26, 2002 episode of SmackDown! as a heel (villainous character) along with Shelton Benjamin as Team Angle. The tag team was the \"contingency plan\" of Paul Heyman, and were intended to help WWE Champion Kurt Angle retain his title, attacking Chris Benoit and Brock Lesnar in an attempt to soften them up. They quickly won the WWE Tag Team Championship on February 6, 2003, by defeating Los Guerreros (Eddie and Chavo Guerrero). They held the championship for three months, including a successful title defense at WrestleMania XIX against Los Guerreros and the team of Chris Benoit and Rhyno, before losing the championship to Eddie Guerrero and his new partner Tajiri in a ladder match on May 18 at Judgment Day. On the June 12 episode of SmackDown!, Angle fired Haas and Benjamin after they blamed him for losing the Tag Team Championship and began to question his leadership. The duo then dubbed themselves The World's Greatest Tag Team, although announcers made sure to add \"Self Proclaimed\" to the name. Haas and Benjamin regained the championship from Guerrero and Tajiri on the July 3 episode of SmackDown!, but lost it to the reformed Los Guerreros on September 18. The team was separated when Benjamin was moved to the Raw brand as part of the 2004 Draft Lottery.\n\nAfter Benjamin's draft, Haas turned into a fan favorite and gained Miss Jackie as a valet.  He teamed with Rico to win the WWE Tag Team Championship on April 22, 2004. The pair lost the championship to the Dudley Boyz on June 17, and shortly afterwards, Haas became a singles wrestler, although he retained Miss Jackie as his valet. Haas lost a match to Luther Reigns at the Great American Bash.\n\nHaas was later involved in an angle in which he was in a love triangle with Miss Jackie, who was acknowledged on-screen as his fianc\u00e9e, and Dawn Marie. The storyline culminated when Haas served as the special-guest referee in a match at Armageddon between the two women. After the match, Haas left both women in storyline, although he continued his relationship with Miss Jackie off-screen. In early 2005, he formed a tag team with Hardcore Holly. They were involved in a feud (scripted rivalry) with MNM for the WWE Tag Team Championship, but never won the championship.\n\nOn July 8, 2005, Haas was released by World Wrestling Entertainment along with his real-life wife Jackie Gayda.\n\nIndependent circuit (2005\u20132006) \nHe returned to JAPW later in July 2005, and began a feud for the JAPW Heavyweight Championship with Jay Lethal. On September 10 at JAPW Haas of Pain, Lethal defeated Haas to retain his title. In JAPW, on October 27, 2007, Haas was inducted along with his late brother Russ into the first class of the Jersey All Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame.\n\nHe won the New Legacy Championship at Ballpark Brawl V on August 13, 2005, defeating then-champion Christopher Daniels and Chris Sabin in a triple threat match. He successfully defended the title the next night at Ballpark Brawl VI against Harry Smith with Mick Foley as a referee.\n\nDuring his time back in the independent circuit, Haas competed in the East Coast Wrestling Association's (ECWA) Super 8 Tournament in 2006, where he advanced all the way to the finals before losing to Davey Richards.\n\nWorld Wrestling Entertainment (2006\u20132010)\n\nSingles competition (2006)\n\nHaas returned to WWE in 2006, appearing on the April 17, 2006, episode of Raw as Rob Van Dam's handpicked opponent for his former partner, Shelton Benjamin. Haas defeated Benjamin in the ensuing match. Haas continued to wrestle on the lower midcard spot, becoming a regular fixture on Heat.\n\nOn the June 5, 2006 episode of Raw, Haas inadvertently knocked Lilian Garcia off the ring apron as he was entering the ring. It was announced on WWE's official website that as a result, Garcia suffered a sprained wrist. As a result of the legitimate accident, Haas began a feud with Garcia's onetime storyline love interest Viscera. Haas made advances towards Garcia, at one point forcefully kissing her and then dropping her to the ground. Haas and Viscera continued to fight for Garcia's affection in the ring, until she told them both that she wanted to be \"just friends\". Haas gave Viscera an eye rake in anger, and a blinded Viscera accidentally gave Garcia a Samoan drop. Though it was unintentional, when both Haas and Viscera had seen what had happened to their now former love interest, they simply had a laugh about it, thus making Haas a villain. After that, Viscera and Haas became a tag team, competing on both Raw and Heat until splitting in December 2006.\n\nThe World's Greatest Tag Team reunion (2006\u20132007) \n\nAfter Shelton Benjamin won a match against Super Crazy on the December 4, 2006, edition of Raw, Haas came out to celebrate his win with a bewildered Benjamin. Haas and Benjamin announced the return of The World's Greatest Tag Team on the December 11, 2006 edition of Raw, and they defeated The Highlanders in their return match. They then started a feud with Cryme Tyme. They continued to compete on Raw through the start of 2007, facing teams including John Cena and Shawn Michaels and Ric Flair and Carlito. In mid-2007, The World's Greatest Tag Team feuded briefly with The Hardys in storyline; at the One Night Stand pay-per-view on June 3, 2007, they challenged The Hardys for the World Tag Team Championship in a ladder match but were unsuccessful. The team broke up once again when Benjamin moved to the ECW brand on November 20, 2007.\n\nVarious gimmicks and departure (2008\u20132010) \nEarly in 2008, Haas developed a gimmick in which he would go under the ring in the middle of his matches and re-emerge wearing a mask. In this \"alter-ego\", Haas would sometimes perform luchador-esque maneuvers in a comical fashion (such as attempting a diving splash, but instead landing on his feet and hitting a standing splash). The opponent would often unmask Haas mid-match, returning him to his normal demeanor. During this persona, Haas usually competed in dark matches before the live broadcast of Raw or on Heat.\n\nBeginning in late August, Haas turned into a face and began a storyline in which he began to impersonate other wrestlers, a concept created by John Laurinaitis, a WWE executive. His first match on August 25, 2008 under this gimmick was a loss to Carlito's real-life brother Primo Col\u00f3n, while Haas was parodying Carlito with the name \"Charlito\". He has portrayed such superstars as John Cena, John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield, Jim Ross, The Great Khali, Montel Vontavious Porter, legends such as Stone Cold Steve Austin, Bret Hart, \"Mr. Perfect\" Curt Hennig, Jimmy \"Superfly\" Snuka, Rowdy Roddy Piper, the Undertaker, Hulk Hogan and even WWE Diva Beth Phoenix for which he won a Slammy Award.\n\nOn April 15, 2009, Haas was drafted to the SmackDown brand as part of the 2009 Supplemental Draft. On the May 8, 2009 episode of SmackDown, Haas made his in-ring return to the brand as a heel, abandoning his persona of imitating other wrestlers, and losing to John Morrison in a match where he was accompanied by his former World's Greatest Tag Team partner, Shelton Benjamin. The following week on the May 15, 2009 episode of SmackDown, Benjamin and Haas unofficially reunited and competed against John Morrison and CM Punk in a losing effort, but Benjamin was traded to the ECW brand in June.\n\nOn July 24, 2009 episode of SmackDown, Haas competed against R-Truth in a losing effort. The following week, on July 31, 2009 episode of SmackDown, he competed against The Great Khali, ending in a no-contest due to Kane being involved in the match by attacking Ranjin Singh at Khali's corner.\n\nAfter an absence of several months, Haas made his return to television by teaming with Mike Knox in a losing effort against Cryme Tyme on the December 31, 2009 episode of Superstars. This marked Haas\u2019 last match in WWE.\n\nOn February 28, 2010, WWE announced that Haas had been released from his contract.\n\nIndependent circuit (2010) \nOn March 20, 2010, Haas made a surprise return to Jersey All Pro Wrestling and defeated Devon Moore for the JAPW New Jersey State Championship. On May 22 Haas and JAPW Heavyweight Champion Dan Maff put their titles on the line in a tag team match against the Hillbilly Wrecking Crew (Brodie Lee and Necro Butcher). In the end, Maff turned on Haas and hit him with a chair, after which Lee pinned him to win the JAPW New Jersey State Championship.\n\nOn September 10, 2010, Haas won the NWA Texas Heavyweight Championship by defeating Michael Faith in Amarillo. In May 2011, Haas took part in New Japan Pro-Wrestling's first tour of the United States, the Invasion Tour 2011.

On August 20, 2011, Haas became the inaugural Family Wrestling Entertainment (FWE) Heavyweight Champion by defeating Jay Lethal and Eric Young. He held the championship for four months before losing it to Young on December 17.\n\nRing of Honor (2010\u20132013)\n\nOn September 11, 2010, Haas and Shelton Benjamin made their debut as Wrestling's Greatest Tag Team in Ring of Honor (ROH) losing to The Kings of Wrestling at the Glory By Honor IX pay-per-view. They returned to ROH at the Ring of Honor Wrestling television tapings on December 9, where they defeated the Bravado Brothers (Harlem and Lance).

The earliest record of such an ambulance was probably a hammock-based cart constructed around 900 AD by the Anglo-Saxons.\n\nDuring the Crusades of the 11th century, the Knights Hospitaller set up hospitals to treat pilgrims wounded in their battles in the 'holy land', although there is no clear evidence to suggest how the wounded made their way to these hospitals.\n\nThe Normans used a litter suspended between horses on two poles. Variations on the horse litter and horse-drawn wagons were used until the 20th century.\n\nEarly battlefield treatment \n\nThe first record of ambulances being used for emergency purposes relates to the troops of Isabella I of Castile in 1487. The Spanish army of the time was well treated and attracted volunteers from across the continent; and among their benefits were the first military hospitals (ambulancias), although injured soldiers were not picked up for treatment until after the cessation of the battle, resulting in many dying on the field.\n\nA major change in usage of ambulances in battle came about with the ambulances volantes designed by Dominique Jean Larrey (1766\u20131842), who later became Napoleon Bonaparte\u2019s chief physician. Larrey was present at the battle of Spires,\nbetween the French and Prussians, and was distressed that wounded soldiers were not picked up by the numerous ambulances (which regulations required to be stationed two and half miles back from the scene of battle) until after hostilities had ceased, so he set about developing a new ambulance system. Having decided against using the Norman system of horse litters, he settled on two- or four-wheeled horse-drawn wagons to transport fallen soldiers from the (active) battlefield after they had received early treatment in the field. Larrey adapted the axle assembly from the French army's horse-drawn artillery (\"flying artillery\" \u2013 ) that made their gun carriages especially maneuverable on uneven terrain, and so christened his ambulances \"flying ambulances\" (ambulances volantes).  The flying ambulances were first used by the Army of the Rhine in 1793. Larrey subsequently developed similar services for Napoleon's armies, and adapted his ambulances to the conditions; including developing a litter which could be carried by a camel for the 1798-1801 French campaign in Egypt.\n\nDevelopment of civilian services \n\nIn civilian ambulances, a major advance was made with the introduction of a transport carriage for cholera patients in London in 1832. The Times newspaper said, \"The curative process commences the instant the patient is put in to the carriage; time is saved which can be given to the care of the patient; the patient may be driven to the hospital so speedily that the hospitals may be less numerous and located at greater distances from each other\".\n\nAdvances during the American Civil War \n\nMore advances in medical care for the military were made during the United States\u2019 Civil War. Union military physicians Joseph Barnes and Jonathan Letterman built upon Larrey\u2019s work and designed a prehospital care system for soldiers, which used new techniques and methods of transport. They ensured that every regiment possessed at least one ambulance cart, with a two-wheeled design that accommodated two or three patients. These ambulances unfortunately proved to be too lightweight for the task, and were phased out to be replaced by the \"Rucker\" ambulance, named for Major General Rucker, which was a four-wheeled design, and was a common sight on battlefield of that war. Other vehicles were pressed into service during the civil war, including a number of steamboats, which served as mobile hospitals for the troops. It was in this period that the practice of transporting wounded soldiers to treatment facilities by railroad was introduced.\n\nHospital-based services begin \n\nThe first known hospital-based ambulance service was based out of Commercial Hospital, Cincinnati, Ohio, (now the University of Cincinnati Medical Center) by 1865. This was soon followed by other services, notably the New York service provided out of Bellevue Hospital. Edward Dalton, a former surgeon in the Union Army, was charged with creating a hospital in lower New York; he started an ambulance service to bring the patients to the hospital faster and in more comfort, a service which started in 1869. These ambulances carried medical equipment, such as splints, a stomach pump, morphine, and brandy, reflecting contemporary medicine. Dalton believed that speed was of the essence, and at first the horses were kept in harness while awaiting a call: within a few months this practice had been replaced with a 'drop,' or 'snap,' harness arrangement, whereby the tack was lowered by pulley from the ceiling straight onto the horse: under either scheme, ambulances were ready to go within 30\u00a0seconds of being called. The service was very popular and grew rapidly, with the year 1870 seeing the ambulances attend 1401 emergency calls, but twenty-one years later, this had more than tripled to 4392. For the first week of their operation, the ambulances were crewed by the hospital's house-staff, after which the hospital hired Drs. Duncan Lee and Robert Taylor as full-time ambulance surgeons; going forward, the plan was to crew the ambulances with fresh graduates of Bellevue's surgical training program, who would serve for six-month terms and be replaced by new hires from successive graduating classes.  This scheme foundered immediately, however, when graduates balked at the schedule and the salary offered: $50 a month, twelve-hour shifts, and one day off every four weeks. Instead, by the end of 1869, the system of staffing the ambulance with residents in training (who could simply be assigned, rather than having to be recruited) was firmly established. As late as 1935, these interns were earning the same $50 a month their grandfathers had received.\n\nIn 1867, the city of London's Metropolitan Asylums Board, in the United Kingdom, received six horse-drawn ambulances for the purpose of conveying smallpox and fever patients from their homes to a hospital. These ambulances were designed to resemble private carriages, but were equipped with rollers in their floors and large rear doors to allow for a patient, lying on a specially designed bed, to be easily loaded. Space was provided for an attendant to ride with the patient, and the entire patient compartment was designed to be easily cleaned and decontaminated. Anyone willing to pay the cost of horse hire could summon the ambulance by telegram or in person.\n\nDedicated services begin \nIn 1880, the President of the Liverpool Medical Institution, Reginald Harrison, suggested a horse-drawn ambulance for the city. In 1884, this ambulance service was created based at the Liverpool Northern Hospital: it was the first in Britain.\n\nIn June 1887 the St John Ambulance Brigade was established to provide first aid and ambulance services at public events in London. It was modelled on a military-style command and discipline structure. The St John Ambulance Association had already been teaching first aid to the public for 10\u00a0years prior to that. National or state based branches of St John Ambulance now provides ambulance and first aid services in many countries around the world.\n\nIn Ireland the St John Ambulance was set up in 1903 in the Guinness Brewery in St. James Gate in Dublin by Doctor, later Sir, John Lumsden for workers. In 1910 the Brigade began its first public duty at the Royal Dublin Society. During the 1916 rising and (after becoming the independent St. John Ambulance Brigade of Ireland) the 'Emergency' (World War II) the brigade acted as an ambulance service and remained so until the set up of Regional Ambulance Services.\n\nIn 1938 the Order of Malta Ambulance Corps was set up in Galway. In the years since this voluntary service has gone from strength to strength and is now Ireland's largest voluntary ambulance service and one of Ireland's largest charities.\n\nIn Queensland, Australia, military medic Seymour Warrian called a public meeting in Brisbane and established an ambulance service after witnessing an event at the Brisbane showgrounds during Show Week in 1892. A fallen rider, suffering a broken leg was walked off the field by well-meaning but misguided bystanders, worsening his injury. As a result of the meeting, the Queensland Ambulance Transport Brigade was formed on the 12 September. The first ambulance station in Queensland operated out of the Brisbane Newspaper Company and officers on night duty slept on rolls of newspaper on the floor. They had a stretcher, but no vehicle and transported patients on foot, although in time, they gained horse-drawn stretchers and eventually vehicles. A year after the establishment of the Brisbane centre, another was established in Charters Towers in north Queensland, growing to over 90 community controlled ambulance centres. In 1991 the independent QATB centres amalgamated to form the Queensland Ambulance Service which is now the fourth largest ambulance service in the world.\n\nMass transit use for emergency medical provision \n\nIn the late 19th century St Louis, Missouri, United States started using a trolley car on their tram network designed to act as an ambulance, transporting the sick and injured. The design of the tram network in St Louis was such that the ambulance streetcar, introduced in 1894 was able to reach all 16 infirmaries in the city. Introduced in 1913, trolley cars in Bahia, Brazil, included a fumigating compartment and a two-bed nurses work area. \n\nIn Germany, in 1902, a civilian ambulance train was introduced (building on the use of trains during military conflict) for use during railway accidents. It housed a mobile operating room and eight stretchers. Railroad employed surgeons lived near the railway station where the ambulance train was stationed, and were summoned to urgently attend in the event of an emergency. This train had priority over the tracks, with all other trains obliged to give way.\n\nIntroduction of motor units \n\nIn the late 19th century, the automobile was being developed, and started to be introduced alongside horse-drawn models; early 20th-century ambulances were powered by steam, gasoline, and electricity, reflecting the competing automotive technologies then in existence. However, the first motor-powered ambulance was brought into service in the last year of the 19th century, with the Michael Reese Hospital, Chicago, taking delivery of the first automobile ambulance, donated in February 1899 by 500 prominent local businessmen. This was followed in 1900, by New York City, which extolled its virtues of greater speed, more safety for the patient, faster stopping and a smoother ride. These first two automobile ambulances were electrically powered with  motors on the rear axle.\n\nThe first gasoline-powered ambulance was the Palliser Ambulance, introduced in 1905, and named for Capt. John Palliser of the Canadian Militia. This three-wheeled vehicle (one at the front, two at the rear) was designed for use on the battlefield, under enemy fire. It was a heavy tractor unit, cased in bulletproof steel sheets. These steel shields opened outwards to provide a small area of cover from fire (nine feet wide by  high) for the ambulance staff when the vehicle was stationary.\n\nThe British Army followed quickly behind the Canadians in introducing a limited number of automobile ambulances. In 1905, the Royal Army Medical Corps commissioned a number of Straker-Squire motor ambulance vans. They were based on a double-decker bus manufactured by the same company, although on a shorter wheelbase. A number of them were based in Oxfordshire, serving several major encampments in the area.\n\nThe first mass-production automobile-based ambulance (rather than one-off models) was produced in the United States in 1909 by the James Cunningham, Son & Company of Rochester, New York, a manufacturer of carriages and hearses. This ambulance, named the Model 774 Automobile Ambulance, featured a proprietary , 4-cylinder internal combustion engine. The chassis rode on pneumatic tires, while the body featured electric lights, a suspended cot with two attendant seats, and a side-mounted gong.\n\nWorld War I \n\nDuring World War One, the Red Cross brought in the first widespread battlefield motor ambulances to replace horse-drawn vehicles, a change which was such a success, the horse-drawn variants were quickly phased out. In civilian emergency care, dedicated ambulance services were frequently managed or dispatched by individual hospitals, though in some areas, telegraph and telephone services enabled police departments to handle dispatch duties.\n\nThe equipment carried by the ambulance was changing fast at this time. Traction splints were introduced during World War I, and were found to have a positive effect on the morbidity and mortality of patients with leg fractures. Two-way radios became available shortly after World War I, providing more efficient radio dispatch of ambulances. Shortly before World War II, then, a modern ambulance carried advanced medical equipment, was staffed by a physician, and was dispatched by radio. It was frequently found that ambulances were hearses \u2013 the only available vehicle that could carry a recumbent patient \u2013 and were thus frequently run by funeral homes. These vehicles which could serve for either purpose were known as combination cars.\n\nAir ambulances \n\nDuring World War One, aviation moved from experimentation to a powerful military force, and following the war, with a surplus of aircraft in circulation, new uses were found for the aircraft. This included the conversion of planes throughout the world into ambulance planes. Although in 1917, Lieutenant Clifford Peel, a medical student, outlined a system of fixed-wing aircraft and ground facilities designed to provide medical services to the Australian Outback; the first custom-built air ambulances did not come into existence until the late 1920s. These ideas became reality under the guidance of the Very Reverend John Flynn in 1928 when the Australian Inland Mission service established the Aerial  Medical Service, a one-year experimental program. Physicians in this program had several responsibilities, one of which was to fly out to a patient, treat the patient, and fly the patient to a hospital if the physician could not deliver adequate care on scene. Eventually, this experiment became the Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia.\n\nWorld War II \n\nIn much of the world, ambulance quality fell sharply during the Second World War, as physicians, needed by the armed services, were pulled off ambulances. In the United Kingdom, during the Battle of Britain, the need for ambulances was so great that vans were commandeered and pressed into service, often carrying several victims at once. Following the war, physicians would continue to ride ambulances in some countries, but not in others. Other vehicles, including civilian and police cars were pressed into service to transport patients due to a lack of a dedicated resource.\nMilitary ambulances such as the Austin K2/Y were used both in the combat areas and on the Home Front. The American Dodge 3/4-ton WC-54 became the standard allied ambulance in front-line units.  The Dodge 1/2 ton 9 18 27 became standard around bases overseas and in the States.  They also saw combat in Africa and through parts of Europe and the Pacific.\n\nThe Korean War \n\nDuring the Korean War, the newly created United States Air Force produced a number of air-ambulance units for use in forward operating medical units, using helicopters for rapid evacuation of patients. The H-13 Sioux helicopter, made famous by the film and television versions of M*A*S*H, transported 18,000 wounded soldiers during the conflict. The work of the Medical Air Evacuation Squadrons was a success and was repeated by U.S. forces in Vietnam. The use of helicopters for emergency medical evacuations extended to civilian practice by groups such as the Shock Trauma Air Rescue Society.\n\nMove to on-scene care \n\nAfter the Harrow and Wealdstone rail crash in 1952, ambulances in Britain were restructured to be a \"mobile hospital\", rather than just transporting patients, thus leading to modern ambulances. CPR was developed and accepted as the standard of care for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest; defibrillation, based in part on an increased understanding of heart arrhythmias, was introduced, as were new pharmaceuticals to be used in cardiac arrest situations; in Belfast, Northern Ireland, a mobile coronary care ambulance successfully resuscitated patients using these technologies; and well-developed studies demonstrated the need for overhauling ambulance services. These studies placed pressure on governments to improve emergency care in general, including the care provided by ambulance services. Part of the result was the creation of standards in ambulance construction concerning the internal height of the patient care area (to allow for an attendant to continue to care for the patient during transport), and in the equipment (and thus weight) that an ambulance had to carry.\n\nFew, or perhaps none of the then-available ambulances could meet these standards.  Ambulance design therefore underwent major changes in the 1970s. High-topped car-based ambulances were developed, but car chassis proved unable to accept the weight and other demands of the new standards; van (and later, light truck) chassis would have to be used instead.  The early van-based ambulances looked very similar to their civilian counterparts, having been given a limited amount of emergency vehicle equipment such as audible and visual warnings, and the internal fittings for carrying medical equipment, most notably a stretcher. Freedom House Ambulance Service was the first emergency medical service in the United States to be staffed by paramedics with medical training beyond basic first aid in 1967. As time went on, ambulances matured in parallel to the newly developed EMS, gaining the capacity to carry additional equipment (both portable and permanently installed) as EMTs and paramedics added this equipment to their arsenal.  Ambulance design also evolved to reflect the ergonomics and other human factors of emergency medical care (for instance, raising the roof higher than typical for a van).  Advances in the technology and understanding of emergency vehicle equipment also continued to influence ambulance design, just as it did for police and fire-suppression vehicles.\n\nModern vehicles \n\nModern ambulances are now often custom-built, and as well as the specialist medical equipment now built into the ambulances, industry-wide improvements in vehicle design have had an impact, including improvements in audible and visual warning equipment to help protect crews in vulnerable situations (such as at a road traffic collision), and general improvements such as ABS, which are particularly valuable for ambulances, due to the speeds reached and the weight carried. There have also been improvements to help safeguard the health and welfare of ambulance crews, such as the addition of patient tail lifts, ramps and winches, to cut down on the amount of manual handling a crew must perform.\n\nAmbulance design is still evolving, largely due to the growing skills and role of paramedics and other ambulance crew, which require specialist equipment. Other factors driving improvement include the need to help protect ambulance crews from common accidents, such as traffic collisions and rarer, but potentially catastrophic incidents such as terrorist activities.\n\nSee also\n Dodge WC54\n Combat medic\n Ambulance\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n Ambulance Historical Society Victoria website\n\nAmbulances", "machine_text": "The history of the ambulance can be traced back to ancient times, when makeshift vehicles were used to carry wounded soldiers off the battlefield. However, the first true ambulance service was established in France in 1792 during the Napoleonic Wars. The service was created to transport injured soldiers from the battlefield to field hospitals as quickly as possible. As the concept of emergency medical care spread, ambulance services were established in other countries. In the United States, the first ambulance service was created in Cincinnati in 1865. However, these early ambulances were simply horse-drawn wagons that were converted to carry patients. They lacked any medical equipment or personnel, and patients were often transported in a prone position on a stretcher. It wasn't until World War I that the modern ambulance as we know it today began to take shape. Ambulances began to be equipped with medical equipment such as oxygen tanks, and personnel were trained in first aid and emergency medical care. By the end of the war, ambulances had become an essential part of the military's medical corps. In the years following World War I, ambulance services began to develop in cities throughout the world. In the United States, the first formal ambulance services were established in major cities like New York and Chicago in the 1920s. As technology has advanced, so too has the ambulance. Today's ambulances are equipped with a wide range of medical equipment, including cardiac monitors, defibrillators, and advanced life support systems. They are staffed by paramedics and emergency medical technicians who are trained to provide skilled emergency care. In conclusion, the history of the ambulance is a long and fascinating one, spanning centuries and continents. From humble beginnings as a makeshift vehicle on the battlefield to a vital component of modern emergency medical services, the ambulance has come a long way over the years, and continues to be an essential lifeline for people in need of emergency medical care.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 21311092}

Preceded by a proposal, courtship traditionally begins after a betrothal and concludes with the celebration of marriage (though in the present-day, courtship may precede the betrothal, which is then followed by the wedding). Christian theologian John Piper distinguished courtship from dating, teaching that:\n\nAndre Marie, a brother of the Slaves of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, discusses that courtship allows a couple to become acquainted with one another, and that physical intimacy is saved only for those in wedlock. Christian minister Patricia Bootsma further delineates this distinction, writing that in contrast to the modern conception of dating, in \"courtship, time together in groups with family or friends is encouraged, and there is oversight by and accountability to parents or mentors\". She further states that with courtship, \"commitment happens before intimacy\". \n\nChristian courtship remains normative in certain Christian countries such as Guatemala, in which much of the population belongs to the Roman Catholic Church. In the United States, courtship is seen as a response to secular dating culture in which various Christian communities might find themselves, c. 1985 to present. Motivated by concern for the need of Christian values in contrast to secular dating practices, conservative Christians identified what they saw as key Biblical principles for courtship and romance, and began to disseminate them in the 1980s.\n\nThe practice of traditional Christian courtship among church members belonging to various Christian denominations experienced a revival in the 1980s. Keynote speaker and author Dr. S.M. Davis developed a unique stand on this philosophy, and his materials have been popular with the homeschool culture since the early 1990s.

The process of Christian courtship is different from secular dating, which is often centered around physical attraction and emotional connection. Christian courtship emphasizes the importance of spiritual compatibility and shared values, as these are considered essential for a successful marriage. The principles of Christian courtship include: 1. Prayerful discernment: Christians are encouraged to pray for guidance in seeking a partner, seeking God\u2019s will in the process. 2. Accountability: The couple should have trusted mentors who will give guidance and hold them accountable during the courtship. 3.

Wallace Scott (August 31, 1832 \u2013 May 12, 1903), was a United States soldier who fought with the Union Army as a member of several Pennsylvania infantry units during the American Civil War. Severely wounded during the Siege of Petersburg in 1864, he was recognized for his meritorious service less than eight months later with his nation's highest award for bravery, the U.S. Medal of Honor, for capturing the enemy's flag while serving as captain of Company D of the 157th Pennsylvania Infantry during the Battle of Five Forks, Virginia on April 1, 1865. That award was conferred on April 27, 1865.\n\nFormative years\nBorn in Valley Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania on August 31, 1832 (alternate birth year: 1835), John Wallace Scott was a son of Pennsylvania natives Samuel Scott (1807\u20131884), a farmer, and Jane B. Scott (1807\u20131883). Documented on various records throughout his life as \"J. Wallace Scott\", \"John W. Scott\", \"John Wallace Scott\", and \"Wallace Scott\", J. Wallace Scott was reared in Chester County with siblings: Mary, Louisa and Caroline, who were born respectively circa 1835, 1839 and 1843, and Samuel W. (1845\u20131926). An older sister, Sarah B. Scott (1825\u20131829) died before he and his siblings born. Educated in that county's public schools, J. Wallace Scott then graduated from the Rockville Seminary. By 1850, he was working alongside his father on the family farm.\n\nCivil War\n Two months before his 29th birthday, J. Wallace Scott became one of Pennsylvania's early responders to President Abraham Lincoln's call for volunteers to defend Washington, D.C. following the April 1861 fall of Fort Sumter to the Confederate States Army. After enrolling for military service in West Chester on June 4, 1861, he mustered in as a private with Company A of the 1st Pennsylvania Reserve Regiment (also known as the 30th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry). Promoted to the rank of corporal early during his tenure of service, he and his men captured two enemy supply wagons while assigned to picket duties along an Annapolis Railroad line in Virginia in August 1861. Drawn by two horses each, the wagons were loaded with $5,000 worth of gold bullion and silk slated for use in CSA military uniforms and flags, as well as quinine supplies destined for CSA physicians. Engaged with his regiment in the Seven Days Battles near Richmond, Virginia from June 25 to July 1, 1862, including the battles of Beaver Dam Creek (June 26), Gaines's Mill (June 27), Savage's Station (June 29), Glendale (June 30), and Malvern Hill (July 1), he then fought in the Second Battle of Bull Run (August 28\u201330), and the battles of South Mountain (September 14) and Antietam (September 17). Advanced to the rank of sergeant, he was honorably discharged on October 23 in order to assume a new post with a different regiment.\n\nCommissioned as a second lieutenant, he was assigned to the command staff of Company B, 157th Pennsylvania Infantry on garrison duty at Fort Delaware during the late fall and winter of 1862. On February 27, 1863, Scott was then advanced again in rank. Commissioned as a first lieutenant, he was also appointed as regimental adjutant with the 157th Pennsylvania, which was attached to Tyler's Division, 22nd Corps, and assigned to the defense of Washington, D.C. On May 29, 1864, Scott and his battalion were reassigned to the 2nd Brigade, 4th Division, 5th Army Corps of the Army of the Potomac, and ordered out on operations between North Anna and Cold Harbor, Virginia. Engaged in the battles of Bethesda Church (June 1\u20133) and Cold Harbor (June 1\u201312), the 157th Pennsylvania then participated in the Siege of Petersburg, including the Battle of the Crater (July 30). Attached to the 3rd Brigade, 2nd Division, 5th Army Corps beginning in August 1864, the 157th Pennsylvanians were then assigned to operations along the Weldon Railroad beginning August 18.\n\nWhile engaged in those operations, Scott was wounded. Shot in the right foot by a musket ball on August 23, he also sustained a shrapnel wound to his left leg when an artillery shell exploded near him. Successfully treated for his injuries, he returned to his regiment, and was then advanced in rank again. Commissioned as a captain by Pennsylvania Governor Andrew Gregg Curtin on October 18, he was placed in charge of the 157th Pennsylvania's D Company.\n\nFrom February 5 to 7, 1865, Scott led his men in the Battle of Hatcher's Run. Then, as part of a reorganization of Pennsylvania units, he and the other men from the 157th Pennsylvania were merged into the 191st Pennsylvania Infantry on March 21, 1865, and assigned to the Appomattox Campaign. Just over a week later, Scott performed the act of valor for which he would later be awarded the U.S. Medal of Honor. Engaged in hand-to-hand combat while leading his men in the Battle of Five Forks, Virginia on April 1, 1865, he captured the battle flag of the 16th South Carolina Infantry. He was also brevetted as a major for his meritorious service that day.\n\nScott was then honorably discharged from the 191st Pennsylvania on May 29, 1865.\n\nPost-war life\n Following his honorable discharge, Scott returned home to the Philadelphia area. On November 13, 1866, he wed Mary Roney Thomas (circa 1836 \u2013 early 1899) at the Coatesville Presbyterian Church in Coatesville, Pennsylvania. Their two children, Gertrude Thomas Scott and Henry Guest Thomas Scott (1872\u20131942) were born in Philadelphia, respectively, on November 17, 1867 and April 8, 1872.\n\nAppointed to the appraisal department of the U.S. Customs House in Philadelphia on February 22, 1870, J. Wallace Scott was subsequently promoted several times. By November 1886, he held the title of entry clerk.\n\nAn active member of the Grand Army of the Republic's post number two, Scott was also a member of the Pennsylvania Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States (insignia #13441), and an honorary member of the \"Old Bucktails\" regimental association.\n\nIllness, death and interment\nPreceded in death by his wife and diagnosed with heart and kidney disease, Scott fell ill with pneumonia in 1903, and died in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on May 12.

Early Life and Education: Born in Boston in 1860, John Wallace Scott was the son of Alexander Scott, a telegraph operator in the Civil War. He attended high school in Cambridge and later went on to study electrical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Career: Scott started his career as an electrician for Western Electric in 1880. In 1887, he joined the newly formed American Bell Telephone Company, which would later become AT&T. Scott quickly became an important figure in the company, serving as the chief engineer in charge of the development of new telephone technology. Scott's most significant contribution to the telephone industry was the development of the carbon transmitter. In the early days of telephony, voice signals were transmitted through a liquid transmitter, which was inefficient and produced poor quality sound. Scott's carbon transmitter, which he patented in 1892, revolutionized the industry. The device used carbon granules to transmit sound, resulting in clearer and more efficient transmission. The carbon transmitter became the standard in the industry and remained in use until the 1920s. Scott was also involved in the development of the switchboard, which allowed for the widespread implementation of telephones. He collaborated with fellow inventor Thomas A. Edison to create the first large-scale switchboard system, which was used by American Bell Telephone Company and helped to establish them as the dominant player in the industry. In addition to his work in the telephone industry, Scott was an entrepreneur and founded several successful companies, including Scott Engineering Company and Scott Radio Laboratories. He was also a member of various professional organizations and received numerous awards for his contributions to the field of electrical engineering. Legacy: John Wallace Scott's contributions to the telephone industry were crucial to its development and contributed to the growth of communication technology in the 20th century. His carbon transmitter and work on the switchboard helped to establish the foundations of modern telecommunications. He is remembered as a pioneer in the field of electrical engineering and continues to inspire innovators in the industry today.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 42977540}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Haj Ali Razmara\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Ali Razmara, also known as Haj Ali Razmara (; 30 March 1901 \u2013 7 March 1951), was a military leader and prime minister of Iran.\n\nHe was assassinated by 26-year-old Khalil Tahmassebi of the Fadayan-e Islam organization outside the Shah Mosque in Tehran at the age of 49. Razmara was the third Iranian prime minister to be assassinated.\n\nEarly life and education\nRazmara (an adopted name loosely translated as \"war planner\" or more accurately \"battle organizer\") was born in Tehran and studied at the military academy of Saint-Cyr in France.\n\nCareer\n\nRazmara was appointed prime minister by the Shah in 1950. He promoted a plan for decentralization of government together with decentralization of the seven-year plan for infrastructure development and improvement. His idea was to bring government to the people; an unheard-of idea in Iran. His plan called for setting up local councils in Iran's 84 districts to run local affairs such as health, education and agricultural programs. One of his most enduring achievements was the institution of the Point IV program via agreement with US President Harry Truman.\n\nRazmara began trimming the government payrolls, eliminating a large number of officials out of a total of 187,000 civil servants. At one stroke he terminated nearly 400 high-placed officials. By so doing, Razmarra earned the wrath of the powerful land-owning and merchant families and most conservatives without gaining the confidence of the radical Tudeh Party. Additionally, his opposition to the expropriation of AIOC assets at Abadan earned him the wrath of the small but powerful group of Majlis deputies known as the National Front. The National Front was led by Majlis Member, Mohammed Mossadegh, whose leading ally in Parliament was the Assembly Speaker, Ayatollah Kashani.\n\nAnglo-Iranian oil negotiations\nAli Razmara came closer than any other prime minister to ratifying the supplemental oil agreement between Iran and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC).  The agreement drew the ire of most Iranians and Majlis of Iran deputies because it provided far less favorable terms than the Venezuela agreement between Standard Oil of New Jersey and the Venezuelan government, or the agreement between the Arabian-American Oil Company and the Saudi Arabian government. In addition, it gave continuous control of Iran's oil industry to a foreign company and country; the living and working conditions of its Iranian workers were extremely poor; it refused to allow Iranians a greater voice in the company's management; and it denied them the right to audit the company's books. The AIOC did, however, offer a few improvements: it guaranteed that its annual royalty payments would not drop below 4 million pounds; it would reduce the area where it would be allowed to drill; and it promised to train more Iranians for administrative jobs. Razmara asked Anglo-Iranian to revise some of the agreement terms, namely to allow Iranian auditors to review their financial activities, offer Iranians managerial jobs, and pay some of the royalties to the Iranian government in advance.  The British refused and lost the opportunity.\n\nRazmara was in office at the direct urging of the British Foreign Office and the AIOC to the Shah. They wanted a stronger figure than Razmara's predecessor, Prime Minister Mansur, to ensure the success of the Supplemental Agreement.  \"Only a man with [Razmara's] fierce determination, they believed, would be strong enough to face down Mossadegh and the National Front.\"\n\nAssassination\nOn 7 March 1951, Razmara went to the Shah Mosque for a memorial service. The police opened a corridor through the inner courtyard for him. The assassin, in the crowd, fired three quick shots, fatally wounding the Prime Minister. Khalil Tahmassebi, a member of the group Fadayan-e Islam, was arrested at the scene.\n\nAt a public demonstration the following day attended by more than 8,000 Tudeh Party members and National Front supporters, Fadayan-e Islam distributed leaflets carrying a threat to assassinate the Shah and other government officials if the assassin, Tahmassebi, was not set free immediately. Threats were also issued against any Majlis member who opposed oil nationalization.\n\nThe National Front was led by Mohammed Mossadegh, who became prime minister within two months of Razmara's assassination. Ayatollah Seyid Abol Ghasim Kashani, the leader of the country's mullahs, ended his support for the Fadayan-e Islam after the assassination. Kashani then became closer to the National Front. On the other hand, the assassin, Tahmassebi, was freed by the Iranian Parliament in 1952, but then he was tried and executed in 1955.\n\nIn 1954 Navab Safavi, founder of the Fadayan-e Islam, in a speech to the Muslim Brotherhood meeting in Egypt, declared that he himself had killed Razmara.\n\nEffects on Iranian government\n\nOn 12 March 1951 the Majlis voted to nationalize Iran's oil. Not one Majlis member voted against the Act. A spectator in the gallery is reported to have shouted \"Eight grains of gunpowder have brought this about.\" This was followed by a vote on 28 March to expropriate the AIOC properties at Abadan.\n\nThe Shah appointed Hussein Ala to succeed Razmara as prime minister. This move was met by further assassinations, riots, and demonstrations throughout the country. Ala ultimately resigned his post as prime minister. The Shah opted to go with former Prime Minister Sayyid Ziya al-Din Tabatabai but the Majlis, led by the National Front, voted Mohammed Mossadegh to the post.\n\nThe nationalization of the oil industry was supported by the vast majority of the Iranian public, who believed it would lead to prosperity for all. After a series of further assassinations of several more government ministers by their then ally Fad\u0101'iy\u0101n-e Islam, Prime Minister Mossadegh and the National Front were finally able to nationalize the oil and expel the AIOC. As this move dealt a severe blow to the monarchy as well as to British interests in Iran, the US and Britain orchestrated the now well-known coup d'\u00e9tat in 1953, code-named Operation Ajax, removing Mossadegh as Prime Minister and convincing the Shah to appoint a Prime Minister of their choosing. Mohammad Reza Shah remained in power until the 1979 revolution, which led to the establishment of the Islamic Republic.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\n 'Al\u00ed Riz\u0101 Awsat\u00ed (\u0639\u0644\u064a\u0631\u0636\u0627 \u0627\u0648\u0633\u0637\u0649), Iran in the past three centuries (Ir\u0101n dar Se Qarn-e Goz\u0332ashteh \u2013 \u0627\u064a\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u062f\u0631 \u0633\u0647 \u0642\u0631\u0646 \u06af\u0630\u0634\u062a\u0647), Volumes 1 and 2 (Pakt\u0101b Publishing \u2013 \u0627\u0646\u062a\u0634\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a \u067e\u0627\u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628, Tehran, Iran, 2003).

Over the years, Haj Ali Razmara rose through the ranks of the army to become the chief of staff of the Iranian armed forces. He was a staunch advocate of modernizing Iran's military and played a key role in restructuring it. His efforts were rewarded when he became the Minister of War in 1949. Haj Ali Razmara's tenure as Prime Minister was marked by his efforts to implement important reforms in Iran. He believed that economic and political stability were essential for the country's advancement. During his time in office, he worked towards strengthening Iran's economy and reducing government corruption. He also initiated a number of ambitious development projects, such as the construction of the Trans-Iranian Railway. However, Haj Ali Razmara's policies were not always popular. He faced opposition from various political factions, including conservative religious groups who accused him of being too secular.

Haj Ali Razmara's legacy lives on, not only in the reforms he implemented but also in the Iranian army's modern structure. His assassination was a turning point in Iranian history, signaling the beginning of a period of political unrest that ultimately led to the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Cello Sonata (Strauss)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Richard Strauss composed his Cello Sonata in F major, Op. 6, TrV 115, in 1883 when he was 19 years old. It was dedicated to the Czech cellist Hanu\u0161 Wihan, who gave the premiere in 1883. It rapidly became a standard part of the cello repertoire.\n\nComposition history\n\nStrauss completed the first version of the Cello Sonata on 5 May 1881. His sister Johanna was a good friend of Dora Wihan, a talented pianist and wife of the cellist Hanu\u0161 Wihan (he was known by the first name Hans in Germany), who played in the Munich Court orchestra along with Richard's father Franz. \"Through these relationships, Strauss came to know Wihan and his instrument's idiomatic possibilities\". He composed and dedicated the sonata for \"his dear friend\" (Seinem lieben Freunde) Hans Wihan. On the first manuscript, he added a verse by Austrian poet Franz Grillparzer:\n\nIn March 1883 he revised the sonata into its current form, notably replacing the original finale with a completely new one. The sonata is in the traditional three movements:\n\n Allegro con brio\n Andante ma non troppo.\n Finale - Allegro vivo.\n\nNorman Del Mar wrote that \"...the influence of Mendelssohn is strongly marked. The opening of the sonata has a fine verve and Strauss wrote proudly home to his parents that the celebrated violinist Joseph Joachim had congratulated him\" Strauss had met Joachim at an evening concert on 16 January at Berlin where they shared the stage: Strauss had accompanied Robert Hausmann in the Cello Sonata, and Joachim continued with the Beethoven Romance in G and Bach's Chaconne from the D minor Partita.\n\nPerformances\n\nThe premiere was given on 6 December 1883 in Nuremberg, by Hans Wihan and pianist Hildergard von Koenigs.  On 19 December of the same year, while visiting Dresden, Strauss accompanied the principal cellist of the Dresden Court Orchestra, Ferdinand B\u00f6ckmann. Oscar Franz, a horn player in the orchestra, reported to Franz Strauss: Your son's wonderful sonata had a magnificent reception and is indeed a splendid work, full of original feeling, and everything flows so wholesomely from it. I take the greatest pleasure in your son's success.\n\nWilli Schuh notes that \"Of all the works from this period of Strauss's creative life, the Cello Sonata is still the one that is heard most often\", and that \"This sonata quickly became one of Strauss's most frequently performed works\". Strauss himself accompanied the sonata on several occasions later in his life: including concerts at Leipzig on 31 March 1890 (Alvin Schr\u00f6der on Cello)), New York on 18 March 1904 (Leo Schulz) and Manchester (UK) on 21 December 1904 (Carl Fuchs).\n\nRomanze for cello and orchestra \n\nAbout the same time as Strauss wrote the Sonata, he also wrote a single movement Romanze for cello and orchestra. Norman Del Mar wrote:  A further composition for the Cello, though this time with orchestral accompaniment, also belongs to this period, a most attractive Romanze which has unfortunately remained unpublished. It is a gentle 3/8 movement, similar in type to the slow movements of the violin and Horn concertos, both of which precede by date of composition.\n\nThe piece was completed on 17 June 1883, and was performed a few times by Hans Wihan, who premiered it on 15 February 1884 at Baden-Baden and went on to perform it in Aachen, Freiburg, and elsewhere It was dedicated to Anton Ritter von Kn\u00f6zinger. The piece somehow came to be forgotten, but was eventually published by Schott in 1987. It was first performed in modern times by cellist Jan Vogler, with the Orchestra of the Dresden Semperoper conducted by G\u00fcnter Neuhold on 12 May 1986. The orchestra is double woodwind, two horns and strings. The piece takes about 10 minutes to perform.\n\nThere is also an abridged (shortened) version of the Romanze for Cello with piano accompaniment, which Strauss dedicated to Ferdinand B\u00f6ckmann (principal cellist in the Dresden Court Orchestra).  This is about one third of the length \"and also shows numerous deviations from the original orchestral version\". Many copies of this version have survived, indicating its popularity at the time. Whether Wihan used a piano arrangement of the orchestral version or the abridged version \"it is no longer possible to say\". The abridged version was first performed in modern times by Peter W\u00f6pke on cello accompanied by Wolfgang Sawallisch on 17 October 1985 in Munich.\n\nThe Dora Wihan-Weis affair\n\nRichard Strauss became close to Dora, who was four years older than him. Sister Johanna Strauss wrote of Dora, \"She was like one of the family. Herr Wihan was insanely jealous over this pretty and already rather coquettish wife. I often witnessed scenes. When Richard was with us, we used to make music. She was very musical and an excellent piano player\". The marriage ended in divorce after a few years. Hans left to become a Professor at the Prague Conservatory and going on to found the celebrated Bohemian Quartet and later worked with Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k on his Cello Concerto in B minor. Dora and Richard developed a deep understanding and whole-hearted liking, and \"there can be no doubt that they were in love for some years\". Dora kept a photograph of Richard (inscribed To his beloved and only one, R) on her piano until she died in 1938.  They wrote many letters to each other, which she ordered be destroyed on her death.  Strauss also destroyed her letters to him: possibly because of his jealous wife Pauline de Ahna whom he married in 1894. There was a lot of gossip in Munich, and when Richard moved to Meiningen his father warned him of the need to preserve a spotless reputation: \"Don't forget how people here talked about you and Dora W.\" There is one surviving letter from Richard to Dora, written in 1889: \"The fact is, that your letter, putting off the prospect of seeing you again for the foreseeable future, has upset and distressed me deeply. God, what wooden expressions those are for what I really feel...Strauss the artist is doing very well! But may no happiness be complete?!\"\n\nIn January 1911, they met again under difficult circumstances in Dresden. Dora was the co-repetiteur at the rehearsals for the premiere of Der Rosenkavalier. Strauss gave her a signed copy of the vocal score. Sister Johanna was delighted to meet her old friend, inviting her to dinner with the family. Wife \"Pauline was furious and treated Dora like a rival. Richard, as always, took his wife's part, and there was no further contact between them\". In his notebook, there is a cryptic entry on 9 March 1911 \"Letter to Hanna (his sister, Johanna) concerning D.Wihan\" (Brief an Hanna weg D.Wihan). On 31 January 1938 he made the entry \"Dora Wihan-Weis deceased\".\n\nRecordings \nThe first recording of the sonata was made by Raya Garbousova with pianist Erich Itor Kahn, issued as part of the Concert Hall Society Limited Edition Records in 1948-9 (reference C14, consisting of three 78rpm records), which is not at present available. There is a recording from December 1953 at the Beethoven-Saal, Hanover with Ludwig Hoelscher and pianist Hans Richter-Haaser. Another historic recording was made on 28 September 1966, with cellist Gregor Piatigorsky and Leonard Pennario, at the Webster Hall, New York issued on RCA Victor. There are many recordings currently available, which include:\n\nThe Romanze has been recorded many times with orchestra or piano since it was published in 1987/8, and is often released alongside the Cello sonata.

The Cello Sonata was premiered at an evening concert in Berlin in 1883, performed by the composer himself on the piano and cellist Hermann Ritter. It was well received by the audience and critics, and it quickly earned a reputation as one of the most significant works of the Romantic era. The Sonata features four movements, each revealing a different aspect of the composer's genius. The opening movement, marked Allegro ma non troppo, is characterized by its dynamic contrasts and virtuosic cello lines. The following Andante con moto is an emotional and expressive lyrical dialogue between the cello and piano. The third movement, Scherzo, is a playful and energetic piece featuring the syncopated rhythms that Strauss was known to use frequently. Finally, the sonata concludes with a fast-paced and complex Allegro molto, where the skill of the performers is put to the test. The Cello Sonata remains a popular and frequently performed work in the cello repertoire, with many accomplished musicians taking it up as part of their repertoire. Its unique combination of melody, harmony, and virtuosity has endeared it to audiences worldwide for over a century. In conclusion, the Cello Sonata (Strauss) is a seminal work by Richard Strauss, one that offered a glimpse of the genius that the composer would come to embody.

This article will provide an overview of some of the key occurrences and milestones of 1839 in Canada. One of the most significant events of the year was the Lower Canada Rebellion, which began in November 1837 and continued into 1839. The rebellion was led by French-Canadian patriots who were protesting against the British colonial government's perceived injustices and lack of representation for French-Canadians. In November 1838, 58 rebels were sent to Australia as part of their punishment. The following year, the Durham Report was published, which proposed several reforms for British North America. It recommended merging Upper and Lower Canada into a single colony with responsible government, which meant that the elected representatives would hold most of the power instead of the governor. The report was controversial and led to considerable debate and dissent. Another important event of 1839 was the founding of the Bank of Montreal, which was Canada's first bank. The bank was established to help support the rapidly growing economy of Canada, which was experiencing a commercial and industrial boom at the time. In addition, 1839 was the year in which the Rideau Canal was completed in Ontario. The canal connected Ottawa to Kingston, providing a vital transportation link between the St. Lawrence River and the Ottawa River, which helped to boost trade and commerce in the region. Overall, 1839 was a pivotal year in Canadian history, marked by significant political and economic developments. The Lower Canada Rebellion and the Durham Report helped to shape the future of Canada's governance structure, while the establishment of the Bank of Montreal and completion of the Rideau Canal played key roles in Canada's economic growth and success.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 485799}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"The Linus Pauling Quartet\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Linus Pauling Quartet was an American psychedelic rock group which specializes in a specific subgenre known as \"Texas Psych\", but frequently dabbles also in garage rock, stoner rock, punk rock, and heavy metal at various points throughout their discography. The LP4 was formed in 1994 by veterans of various local groups from the Houston and Clear Lake areas of Texas. Born of the same musical cauldron that birthed such renowned Texas Psych favorites as The Mike Gunn, Dry Nod, and Schlong Weasel, bands which also included later members of Charalambides and Dunlavy, the LP4 got off the ground when guitarist Ramon Medina and bassist Stephen Finley recruited drummer Larry Liska and singer/guitarist Clinton Heider and the quartet began writing and recording songs for their first album, Immortal Chinese Classics Music, released in 1995 on their own Worship Guitars label. The album surprisingly earned considerable attention beyond their native Houston, garnering notable reviews in several music magazines such as Q Music, Factsheet Five, Alternative Press, Crohinga Well, and Ptolemaic Terrascope, and featured \"The Linus Theme\" and \"Hamburger Girl\", two songs which came to define the band's early years, and which the LP4 revisited many times throughout their career.\n\nThe band's notice by Ptolemaic Terrascope was particularly helpful, as the LP4 were invited to contribute a track to the magazine's inaugural benefit compilation double-CD Succour. An all-night practice space recording session yielded not only their contribution \"Dartania\", which was chosen as the lead-off track on the benefit album, but also a batch of other tracks split evenly between improvisations and structured songs, which were ultimately released by German label September Gurls in 1997 as a self-titled limited edition vinyl album.\n\nArmed with a recording contract with September Gurls, in 1996 the band added analog synthesizer player Flip Osman and saxophonist/guitarist/singer Charlie Horshack, swelling their ranks and expanding their sonic palette, and this lineup released Killing You With Rock in 1998. The following year, they were featured on a split 7\" vinyl single with Italian band Kryptasthesie, contributing a very rare live version of their song \"Jason Bill\", a tribute to the erstwhile Charalambides guitarist.\n\nThe year 2000 was an active year for the Linus Pauling Quartet: they were invited to Seattle, Washington, to play at the fourth Terrastock psychedelic music festival alongside such musical luminaries as Bardo Pond, Moe Tucker, and Ghost; and they released Ashes in the Bong of God, a \"concept album\" related to their ongoing saga of the \"bongs of power\", alien \"bug people,\" and \"the Great Singularity,\" issued on double vinyl in Europe through the September Gurls label and on CD in the United States through the Fleece label. It was also during this time that Flip Osman left Houston and the band added keyboardist and photo-theremin player Carol Sandin to the group, though both members were present at the band's appearance at Terrastock IV.\n\nThe LP4 contributed a notable version of Syd Barrett's song \"Vegetable Man\" to The Vegetable Man Project, a compilation of wildly disparate covers of that song released by Italian label Oggetti Volanti Non Identificati in 2002.\n\nIn 2003 the band released their final offering on the September Gurls label: , a massive slab of psych-rock showing the full range of the band's abilities, including MC5-esque garage rock, a psychedelic depiction of airplanes falling out of the sky, songs about bongs, a song about eating Mexican food with Satan, and a lush psych-rock cover of Kraftwerk's \"Hall of Mirrors\".\n\nThe band appeared at showcases at Austin's South by Southwest festival in 2004, 2005, and 2008. Otherwise, the next few years were outwardly quiet for the LP4, but they were hard at work recording a large cache of material which would go on to comprise much of their subsequent two albums, and continuing to compose more material for future releases, intermittently taking breaks to play shows in their native Houston; Carol Sandin departed the group during this time. All Things Are Light, self-released in conjunction with Camera Obscura on purple vinyl and made up primarily of some of the band's heaviest music to date, garnered a considerable number of positive reviews upon its release in December 2007. On the heels of this release, the band was again invited to perform at Terrastock in June 2008, this time in Louisville, Kentucky, resulting in one of their most memorable shows, playing alongside such notable psychedelic groups as MV & EE, Robert Schneider's Thee American Revolution, Damon & Naomi, and Kawabata Makoto.\n\n2010 saw the band release a 7\" vinyl split single with Austin sister-band ST 37; ST 37 contributed a cover of Helios Creed's \"Lactating Purple\", while the Linus Pauling Quartet debuted their original piece \"Monster\". Only months later the band released Horns of Ammon, an album of songs recorded with Carol Sandin, primarily dating back to 2003-2005, released on Homeskool Records; it included the single \"Monster\", as well as the biker anthem \"HAWG!!!\", previously released as a single through the extremely limited-edition Grey Ghost series in Houston. Though the album was essentially an \"odds and sods\" release, documenting a set of more melodic and textural music than appeared on the other \"official\" albums contemporaneously released, it received largely positive reviews. The band released their next and eighth official studio album, entitled Bag of Hammers, in September 2012. A heavier sounding release than the material presented on Horns of Ammon, it also included one of the first examples of the band employing a guest vocalist as the lead singer on the song \"Rust\", which was sung by Hearts of Animals vocalist Mlee Marie. It was at this point that the band began producing homemade videos to some of their songs; album lead-off track \"Crom\" and \"Victory Gin\" were both set to videos created predominantly by band guitarist Ramon Medina.\n\nIn January 2013, the Linus Pauling Quartet released Assault on the Vault of the Ancient Bonglords, a three-disk anthology covering their earliest recordings from 1994 all the way through 2010, packaged with a fully playable Dungeons & Dragons-style dice-based roleplaying game module, and a purple 20-sided die. The band followed this up in July 2013 with the 7\" EP Find What You Love And Let It Kill You, which showcased the songwriting of Ramon Medina, as well as a considerably softer side of the Linus psychedelic sound. The EP also resulted in another Medina video, this time for the song \"The Road\", which again featured Mlee Marie, playing a bell-like keyboard part which helped underline the song's fragile feel and circular structure.\n\nIn October 2014, the Linus Pauling Quartet released both a video and a 7\" single for their song C is for Cthulhu, an epic retelling of the discovery of Cthulhu and the ensuing slaughter and madness.  For the B side, the LP4 reached back into Houston's swirling psychedelic past to cover My Desire, originally by Houston's Pain Teens, featuring Bliss Blood and Scott Ayres.  The accompanying video starred Burn the Boats vocalist Stevie Sims and MMA fighter Makana Clemons as intrepid and fearless archaeologists who seek that which should be left unknown.  Employing a rugged captain and his trusty crew (The LP4\u2019s Charlie Horshack, Clinton Heider, and Stephen Finley), they sail to the fabled R\u2019lyeh to meet their fate.  The new video was described by The Big Takeover as \u201cinsanely ambitious\u201d and by the Houston Press as a  \u201cmonumental work\u201d .  Over a year was spent building sets, crafting a stop motion Cthulhu from scratch, as well as shooting stop motion sequences and live actors.\n\nIn May 2015, the band released the single \"Planck\", a song co-written with band associate Brandon R. Brown, based on his contemporaneously published book Driven By Vision, Broken By War about German physicist Max Planck, as a teaser for their next full-length release.  Finally, the band released its long awaited follow-up to Bag of Hammers:  entitled Ampalanche, it released first on vinyl through Italian label Vincebus Eruptum in January 2016, and then in April of that year, it was released digitally online, paired with a 49-minute bonus track:  \"Vi, de Druknede (We, the Drowned)\", a droning wordless group improvisation based on twin electronic tambouras. In July 2017, the group contributed side one to the Vincebus Eruptum label's third Psychedelic Battles split LP with Colt38, including their final masterpiece, \"Jolakottur,\" the lyrics of which were derived from Icelandic folklore.\n\nShortly thereafter, the band split, with lead singer/songwriter/guitarist Clinton Heider moving on to new adventures, including playing guitar with Mlee Marie's band Hearts of Animals, and the rest of the group re-teaming with earlier keyboardist/vocalist Carol Sandin Cooley, now calling themselves the Cryptographers, with Medina and Sandin Cooley taking over singing and songwriting duties, sporting a somewhat poppier sound informed by krautrock, indie rock, and the Velvet Underground.\n\nSelected discography \nImmortal Chinese Classics (Worship Guitars, CD, USA, 1995)\nUntitled (Alien LP) (September Gurls, LP, Germany, 1997)\nKilling You With Rock (September Gurls, CD Germany, 1998)\nVA - Succour (Ptolemaic Terrascope, 2X CD, UK, 1995) (Reissued by Flydaddy, USA 1996)\nLP4/Kryptasthesie (Mizmaze, 7\", Italy, 1999)\nVA - Thou Shalt Expand Your Mind (Ptolemaic Terrascope, CD, UK, 1999)\nAshes in the Bong of God (Fleece,CD, USA, 2000)\nAshes in the Bong of God (September Gurls, 2x LP, Germany, 2000)\nVA - The Vegetable Man Project (Oggetti Volanti Non Identificati, CD, Italy, 2002)\n (September Gurls, CD, Germany, 2003)\nSongs Of The Cretaceous (Shifty Pope, CD, USA, 2005)\nAll Things Are Light (Camera Obscura, LP, Australia, 2007)\nHAWG!!! - Grey Ghost No.\u00a048 (Grey Ghost, CD, USA, 2007)\n (No Label, 7\", USA, 2010)\nHorns Of Ammon (Homeskool Records, CD, USA, 2010)\nBag Of Hammers (Homeskool Records, CD, USA, 2012)\nAssault on the Vault of the Ancient Bonglords (Homeskool Records, 3xCD, USA, 2013)\nFind What You Love And Let It Kill You (Homeskool Records, 7\", USA, 2013)\nC is for Cthulhu b/w My Desire (Homeskool Records, 7\", USA, 2014)\nAmpalanche (Vincebus Eruptum, LP, Italy, 2016)\nPsychedelic Battles Volume Three (Vincebus Eruptum, split LP w/ Colt38, Italy, 2017)\n\nExternal links \n Linus Pauling Quartet\n Linus Pauling Quartet on Rutracker\n \n\nMusical groups from Houston\nPsychedelic rock music groups from Texas\nStoner rock musical groups", "machine_text": "The Linus Pauling Quartet is a psychedelic rock band from Houston, Texas, named after the American chemist and peace activist Linus Pauling.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Joseph Gluckstein Links\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Joseph Gluckstein Links  (13 December 1904 \u2013 1 October 1997) was a British author, art historian, and furrier who is principally known for his expertise and works on the Venetian painter Canaletto and for Venice for Pleasure, a travel guide to Venice, Italy.\n\nEarly life\n\nJoseph Gluckstein Links was born on 13 December 1904 in London, United Kingdom, to Katey (n\u00e9e Symons, 1 February 1882 - 29 August 1918) and Calman Links (1868 \u2013 16 August 1925).\nJoseph or Joe, he was commonly called, had two younger siblings, Eileen Hannah Links (25 August 1909 \u2013 1982) and Joyce Links (15 October 1914 \u2013 ).\n\nHis father was a Jewish refugee from Hungary who had co-founded the fur business, Calman Links. \nHis mother died in 1918 before he was 13 years old. Two years later his father learned that he was also terminally ill. With no time to spare, he removed his son from school in order before he died to teach him the fur trade in general and how to run the business.\n\n\"I was an unwilling and sullen pupil,\" Links wrote, but he later appreciated that forced him into a career. \"There was the business and I jolly well had to go and earn my living at it.\"\n\nCareer\n\nFurrier \n\nWhile his father had mostly traded in skunk skins and thus the low end of the fur trade, Links after taking responsibility for the business moved it upmarket. In the 1920s, fur was very popular in the fashion world with every woman wanting a fur coat. By the 1930s, Calman Links was one of its most prominent furriers in London, which at the time was the epicenter of a booming luxury fur trade. Even the Great Depression had little impact on Calman Links.\n\nFor many years the business was located at 33 Margaret Street, London.\n\nCalman Links eventually gained the royal warrant and Links was for a period a director of the Hudson's Bay Company, and served as President of the British Fur Trade Alliance.\n\nIn 1956, Links wrote a book on fur, The Book of Fur.\n\nBeginning of his writing career \n\nLinks was a friend of Nancy Robinson heiress to the Nugget Boot Polish fortune who, married Dennis Wheatley in 1922. The two men became lifetime friends and remained so after Wheatley's and Robinson divorced in 1930. The pair shared a taste for luxury, most notably in the form of good cigars and expensive wines. As Wheatley attempted to write his first novel, Links supported him with advice and by lending money.\n\nOne night over dinner, circa 1935, Links suggested to Wheatley they consider cooperating to produce a murder mystery in the form of a dossier of clues.\nFor a period Wheatley was unconvinced as Links had no background in writing, yet alone game design. Wheatley was by now in demand as a writer, but had no experience in writing detective novels.  Worn down by Links' persistence Wheatley approached his publisher, Hutchinson, but they were lukewarm as it would be expensive to produce and was not something they had experience in. In order to keep  Wheatley happy, they finally agreed, provided Links and Wheatley would be willing to accept no royalties at all on the first 10,000 copies sold, and one penny per copy after that. Links and Wheatley agreed to these terms. Links planned the mystery and devised the clues, while Wheatley wrote the text of the included documents. As Wheatley's name was known to the reading public, the dossier was credited to Wheatley, with a \u201cplanned by J.G. Links\u201d below in smaller letters.\n\nTheir first effort Murder off Miami was published on 23 July 1936 at a price of 3 shillings and 6 pence. Initially bookstall and bookshop managers was largely negative as they were difficult to display and it was felt that they were too innovative for general consumption. To over counter this apprehension Wheatley entertained numerous London bookshop managers which convinced them to take a small number.\n\nSelfridges agreed to take 1,000 copies, provided Wheatley signed each one, which he gladly did. 120,000 copies were sold in six months and it went on to sell over 200,000 copies in Britain in its first year. Queen Mary purchased six copies from Hatchards. It was translated into several other languages.\n\nAlthough there had been \u2018solve it yourself\u2019 crime books in the past, such as the \u2018Baffle Books\u2019 created by Lassiter Wren and Randle McKay, Links and Wheatley took it to another level, by providing a cardboard folder containing all the evidence that an investigating team of detectives might gather. In the folder was a variety of reports, testimonies, letters, as well as physical clues such as hairs or pills. The reader had to inspect this evidence to solve the mystery before checking his conclusion with the actual solution, concealed within a sealed section towards the rear of the folder. In all four 'Crime Dossiers' were published, the others being Who Killed Robert Prentice?, The Malinsay Massacre, and Herewith The Clues!.\n\nSome of the letters in Who Killed Robert Prentice? were scented with unique perfumes, providing vital clues about their origins, while there was a torn-up photograph of the victim cavorting with a naked woman. The reader had to reassemble this photograph to obtain a clue.\n\nThe crime dossiers were very popular both in Britain and around the world. When published in Germany, the Nazi Chamber of Literature and the Ministry of Propaganda took a dim view of Who Killed Robert Prentice claiming that the main protagonist, Cicely Prentice, was a woman whose \"moral character must be designated more than inferior\". For many years it had been assumed that as a result it had been banned, but evidence has surfaced that there was pre-war German edition.\n\nBeginning in 1979 with Murder off Miami all four were reissued by Hutchinson in facsimile over the next three years, ending with Herewith the Clues in 1982 to modest press notices and modest sales.\n\nIn 1986, Webb and Bower in conjunction with Michael Joseph, unsuccessfully published the crime dossiers in glossy hardback editions, with the physical clues reduced to photographs.\n\nWorld War II \n\nDuring the Second World War, Links served as a Wing Commander in the Royal Air Force working on barrage balloons in the Air Ministry.\n\nA chance meeting during his military service bought him into contact with Robert Lutyens, son of the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens. Through Robert Lutyen, Links, a longtime bachelor met his sister, Mary, whom he subsequently married in 1945.\n\nVenice \n\nInitially, Links proposed having their honeymoon on a troopship going to New York, but Mary's objection led to the selection of Venice as a more suitable option.\n\nThis first visit for both of them to Venice resulted in them becoming instantly captivated and for the next 30 years, they visited Venice two\u2013three times a year. In the late 1960s, Links became involved in the establishment of the Venice in Peril Fund, a fund to prevent the buildings of Venice from crumbling into its lagoon. Both Links and Mary supported it for the rest of their lives.\n\nAlready an admirer of art critic John Ruskin, Links took along on one of their early visits to Venice, a copy of The Stones of Venice, which lead to Mary writing biographies of both Ruskin and his wife, Effie Gray.\n\nCanaletto \n\nAs a result of fascination with Venice, Links developed in interest in Venetian painter Canaletto. In 1962 Mary gave Links a copy of William G. Constable's recently published monograph on Canaletto, which mentioned a missing painting by the artist. Links recognized it as the painting hanging over his sister-in-law's fireplace and passed this information on to Constable, leading to the two men corresponding. When Constable meet Links in person he asked him to take over revising the book for its second edition. The task took Links six years rather than the six months Constable had anticipated., the resulting book Canaletto: Giovanni Antonio Canal, 1697-1768 when published in 1976 lead to Links who was self-taught and had no formal training becoming recognized as a world expert on Canaletto.\n\nVenice for pleasure \n\nIn reply to his friends constantly asked for advice prior to visiting Venice, Links would write letters describing what to see and do. One such friend intending to visit the city was the publisher Max Reinhardt, of The Bodley Head, to whom Links provided advice in such a letter. Reinhardt's client Charles Chaplin and his wife also found the advice of benefit, which engaged Reinhardt to ask Links to write a book on the subject.\n\nThe result was Venice for Pleasure which upon its publication in 1966 received favourable reviews, with Bernard Levin in The Times stating, \"Not only the best guide-book to that city ever written, but the best guide-book to any city ever written.\"\n\nJames Mustich listed the book in his 1,000 Books To Read Before You Die: A Life-Changing List  offering the opinion that \"Links weaves a spell that evokes the joy of urban wanderings the enduring fascination of beauty, the ambience of time, and the pleasure of coming upon a welcoming cafe at just the moment one's feet need a rest and one's mind a respite.\"\n\nA fifth expanded edition was published in 1994 and by 2015 it was in its ninth edition.\n\nDeath \n\nHe died at his London home on 1 October 1997.\n\nPersonal life \n\nLinks married writer Mary Lutyens (31 July 1908 \u2013 9 April 1999) in 1945, with the marriage ending with his death. While the couple had no children of their own, Links was stepfather to Mary's daughter Amanda Lutyens Sewell by her previous marriage.\n\nHonours \n\nLinks was made an officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for his wartime service in 1946.\n\nBibliography \n\nHe wrote his books using the name, J.

This research helps to inform the organisation's advocacy work and ensures that policies are based on evidence rather than fear or prejudice. The Migrants Rights Network has gained a reputation as a leading voice on migration issues in the UK. It has been actively involved in debates around immigration policy, and its expertise is regularly sought by policymakers, journalists, and other organisations.

Born on 27 December 1793 in Edinburgh, Scotland, Laing grew up in a family of traders, and from a young age, he acquired an interest in Africa and its exploration. Laing's first voyage to Africa took place in 1822 when he accompanied an expedition to the Gambia River. The following year, he joined an expedition to explore the region between the Gambia and Senegal Rivers, which was then a land of Muslim kingdoms and empires such as Bambara, Fulani, Saadi, and Tukulor. Laing's knowledge of Arabic and his skills as a trader and diplomat made him an ideal candidate for exploring the region. In 1825, Laing set out on a journey to cross the Sahara desert from Tripoli in Libya to Timbuktu. He faced numerous challenges on his journey, including a bandit attack near Murzuq, dehydration, and illness. Despite all these hurdles, Laing managed to reach Timbuktu on 18 April 1826, and became the first European to do so. He spent six months in the city, studying the local culture and trading goods such as ivory, gold dust, and ostrich feathers. Laing's achievements as an explorer earned him international fame, and he was awarded the Medal of the Royal Geographical Society in 1827. However, his success was short-lived, as he was killed on his journey back from Timbuktu by Tuareg nomads who were notorious for attacking and robbing travelers in the Sahara. His exact date of death is unknown, but it is estimated to be between late 1826 and early 1827.

The film was aired on ESPN directly after the 2016 Heisman Award Ceremony and premiered to over 2 million viewers, making it the highest rated 30 for 30 film since 2015.  At the 69th Primetime Emmy Awards it was one of that season's 30 for 30 films nominated for Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Series.\n\nBackground \nIn 1985, a rivalry started between the University of Notre Dame and University of Miami football teams after the Miami Hurricanes beat the Notre Dame Fighting Irish 58\u20137. This loss marked head coach Gerry Faust's last game at Notre Dame.\n\nThe rivalry culminated in a showdown three years later, which was dubbed \"Catholics vs. Convicts.\" The name originated from a t-shirt slogan created by Notre Dame students Joe Frederick and Michael Caponigro. The slogan played on Notre Dame's Catholic background and the public perception of Miami's players as college football's \"bad boys,\" a reputation that was reinforced by the arrests of a number of Miami players. Both the Notre Dame Fighting Irish and the Miami Hurricanes came into the game undefeated. Cleveland Gary's controversial \"phantom fumble\" is examined closely in the film.  While studying the game the filmmakers re-examined a second close call by the referees which had gone largely unnoticed at the time.  Both coaches and several players from the game had never seen the replay, leading many of the subjects to reconsider the outcome of the game. Many sportswriters consider it one of the greatest college football games of all time.\n\nThe documentary is partially based on director Patrick Creadon's experience as a Notre Dame undergraduate at the time. Creadon was a senior at Notre Dame in 1988 and knew the students behind the \"Catholics vs. Convicts\" slogan.\n\nCast \nCreadon went back to interview several of his classmates for the documentary, including Patrick Walsh, his best friend from high school who was involved in the t-shirt scandal, and Tony Rice, the starting quarterback who lived down the hall from them in Dillon Hall.

The film, directed by Patrick Creadon, explores not only the game but also the cultural significance of the matchup.

It consists of around 120 species that are native to the South Pacific, Southeast Asia, Australia, and the eastern coast of Africa. The plant derives its name from the Greek word \"amyein,\" which means to suck, which is a reference to their parasitic life cycle. The Amyema plant is a hemiparasitic plant, which means that it lives on trees but still performs photosynthesis through its leaves. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that attach to the branches of the host plant. The plant also has a root system, but it is reduced and may not reach the ground. Amyema plants have adapted to their parasitic lifestyle by developing specialized root-like structures called haustoria that penetrate the bark of the host plant and absorb water, nutrients, and minerals from the host plant. This adaptation helps the plant survive in a nutrient-poor environment and makes them highly successful parasites. The flowers of Amyema plants are small and tubular and are usually red, yellow, or orange in color. They are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies that are attracted to their bright colors and nectar. The fruit of Amyema plants is a small berry that contains one or two seeds. The Amyema plant has a long history of human use. In some cultures, it is used for medicinal purposes to treat various ailments such as fever, cough, and skin diseases. The plant has also been used as a traditional food source by some indigenous communities. In summary, Amyema plants are unique parasitic plants that have adapted to their environment by developing specialized root-like structures that penetrate the bark of their host plant. This adaptation helps the plant to survive in an otherwise nutrient-poor environment. They are commonly used for medicinal and food purposes by some cultures.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 13643435}

However, it was not formally inaugurated until 4 January 1790, when the first meeting was held in the Tuileries Palace in the presence of queen Marie Antoinette, who had excepted the position of Honorary President and Honorary Founder as well as Protector of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, whose actual President and founder were Anne-Fran\u00e7oise de Fougeret. After this, their meetings were regularly held at the H\u00f4pital des Enfants Trouves.\n\nThe purpose of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 was to provide financial aide to poor mothers, particularly mothers of infants. It was inspired by the common phenomena of poor mothers turning in their children to the custody of the hospitals, were conditions were so bad that the mortality of children were high. Women were given aide after the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 had investigated them through visit and inspection, and approved of them as worthy of help.\n\nThe Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 belonged to a then new and modern trend of private secular charity organizations. These were to become typical in the 19th-century, but in the 18th-century they were fairly new, since charity and social help had normally been managed by the church until then. It was also a pioneer innovation in the fact that the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 was managed exclusively by women and thus were a secular women's organization in a time period when women's organizations had until then normally been religious.\n\nThe Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 was closed in 1793 during the Reign of Terror, but reopened in 1801. Emperor Napoleon I took control of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 in 1810 and made it in to an Imperial umbrella organization, inducted all other similar French women's charity organizations in it, and appointed Empress Marie Louise as its Honorary President.

The organization was established in response to the high infant mortality rates in Paris at the time, which were particularly high among mothers and newborns from impoverished backgrounds. The founding members of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Charit\u00e9 Maternelle were a group of prominent women, including Marie-Antoinette, the Queen of France, who served as the organization's patron. They recognized the urgent need to provide adequate medical care, education, and support for pregnant women and new mothers. The organization quickly garnered support, and shortly after its creation, branches were established in other cities in France and throughout Europe. The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Charit\u00e9 Maternelle was revolutionary at the time because it not only provided medical care but also offered women education and support on safe motherhood practices, breastfeeding, and nutrition. During the early years of the organization, midwives were employed, and classes on childbirth, childcare, and nursing were offered to mothers for free. The society also provided financial assistance to desperate mothers who could not afford the basic necessities for themselves and their children.

The genus is only known from a single species, Odaraia alutacea, which is based on a fragmentary fossil consisting of a partial lower jaw with teeth. The genus name Odaraia is derived from the Chinook Jargon word \"udalrai\" meaning \"animal\" or \"beast\", reflecting the fragmentary nature of the fossil remains. The specific epithet alutacea comes from the Latin \"alutaceus\" meaning \"leathery\" or \"tanned\", referring to the texture of the fossil. Odaraia is believed to be a member of the order Litopterna, a diverse group of hoofed mammals that lived in South America during the Cenozoic era. Litopterns are known for their unique dental anatomy, with teeth that are adapted for grinding tough vegetation. Odaraia appears to have had a similar dental structure, suggesting it was also a herbivore. The discovery of Odaraia is significant because it is one of the few examples of a litoptern outside of South America, indicating that these animals may have dispersed into North America during the Oligocene. The fragmentary nature of the fossil, however, makes it difficult to determine the exact evolutionary relationship between Odaraia and other litopterns. Despite its importance, there is little known about the ecology or behavior of Odaraia. Its discovery highlights the diversity of mammalian life during the Oligocene, as well as the potential for further discoveries of new taxa in this time period. In conclusion, Odaraia is a fascinating but enigmatic fossil genus that sheds light on the evolutionary history of litopterns and mammalian diversity during the Oligocene epoch.

Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Shear grew up in a family of inventors and entrepreneurs. Her grandfather was a prominent inventor and entrepreneur who established a successful manufacturing business in Pittsburgh. Her father, a businessman himself, worked closely with his father and was involved in the family\u2019s manufacturing business. Shear attended the University of Pittsburgh, where she studied engineering and developed a keen interest in mechanical design. After graduation, she worked for several years in business management before turning her attention to her true passion: inventing. In 1919, Shear came up with the idea for a new kind of hairpin that was more practical and secure than the bulky, ornamental hairpins popular at the time. She spent several years perfecting her design, experimenting with different materials and shapes, until she developed a pin that was slim, flexible, and easy to use. She patented her invention in 1925 and founded the J.B. Shear Manufacturing Company, naming it after her father. Initially, she marketed her hairpins under the brand name \u201cBob Pins\u201d but later changed it to \u201cBobby Pins,\u201d which became the popular term for the thin, U-shaped hair accessory. Despite facing resistance and skepticism from industry insiders who doubted the viability of her product, Shear persevered and built a successful business around her invention. In addition to her success with hairpins, Shear also patented several other inventions, including a cordless electric fishing reel and a silverware cleaning device. Shear passed away in 1971, but her legacy lives on in the ubiquitous bobby pin, which remains a staple hair accessory to this day.

The station was rebuilt as a through station with platform faces on all lines prior to the opening of the line in November 1899.\n\nIn 1947 a train crash about  south of the station killed 32 people, the worst accident in the history of the Southern Railway.\n\nOn 1 August 2011, a landslide caused by a burst water main occurred approximately  north of the station, blocking the railway for 24 hours.\n\nPlatforms \n\nSouth Croydon has five platforms connected by a narrow subway.\n\nPlatforms 1 and 2 are rarely used as fast Southern services from London Victoria to Brighton, Thameslink services and Gatwick Express, and these services do not call.\n\nPlatform 3 is used by up trains to London Bridge and London Victoria.\n\nPlatform 4 is used by services that do not call, heading southbound, except some peak time services in both directions.\n\nPlatform 5 is used by down trains to Caterham and other destinations.\n\nTicket gates became operational in April 2009.\n\nServices \nOff-peak, all services at South Croydon are operated by Southern using  and  EMUs.\n\nThe typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:\n\n 2 tph to London Bridge (fast from East Croydon)\n 2 tph to London Bridge via  (all stations)\n 2 tph to \n 2 tph to  and , dividing and attaching at \n\nDuring the peak hours, additional services between London Victoria and  (which usually pass through South Croydon) also call at the station. Additional Thameslink services between  and East Grinstead also call during the peak periods.\n\nOn Sundays, the service is reduced to 2 tph and runs between Caterham/Tattenham Corner and London Bridge via Forest Hill.\n\nConnections\nLondon Buses route 455 serves the station.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\nRailway stations in the London Borough of Croydon\nFormer London, Brighton and South Coast Railway stations\nRailway stations in Great Britain opened in 1865\nRailway stations served by Southern", "machine_text": "South Croydon railway station is a railway station in the London Borough of Croydon, located in South Croydon. The station serves the East Grinstead line and is managed by Southern. The station is located about a mile south of central Croydon and is situated on Brighton Road. South Croydon railway station was opened on 10 August 1863 and is one of the oldest stations in the area, having been in continuous operation for over 150 years. The station was originally built as a single platform station with a small building, but it was later expanded to accommodate more trains and passengers. Today, the station has two platforms and is served by regular train services every day of the week. The station building at South Croydon railway station is a Grade II listed building and is situated on the Brighton Road side of the station. It was designed by the architect Charles Harrison Townsend and was built in 1893. The building is one of the few surviving examples of this type of station building, which was once common across the railway network. Despite being an old station, South Croydon railway station is equipped with modern facilities, including ticket machines, ticket barriers, and platform shelters. The station has recently undergone renovation work to improve accessibility, including the installation of a new lift to provide step-free access to the platforms. South Croydon railway station is an important transport hub for the local area and provides easy access to London Victoria, London Bridge, and Gatwick Airport. The station is also served by several bus routes, making it a convenient location for commuters and visitors alike.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1642881}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Jokkmokk Municipality\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Jokkmokk Municipality (, , , ) is a municipality in Norrbotten County in northern Sweden. Its seat is located in Jokkmokk.\n\nThe name Jokkmokk is Sami for the words \"river\" and \"bend\", since the town is situated close to a bend in the nearby river. It's Sweden's poorest municipality.\n\nThe municipality is the second largest in area of all Swedish municipalities and is, with an area of 19,477\u00a0km2 (approximately 7,520 square miles) slightly smaller than Slovenia or the US state of New Jersey. It has never been amalgamated with another entity, having been that large ever since municipalities were established in Sweden in 1863.\n\nHistory\nThe name Jokkmokk is present in the Jokkmokk Lapland Court District, a historical jurisdiction. When the municipality was given its current borders in 1971, its municipal coat of arms were made to depict the hydro plant, the symbol of Lule\u00e5 (to which Jokkmokk belonged until 1673), and the traditional Sami hammers.\n\nGeography\nThe municipality is situated in the Scandinavian Mountains in Swedish Lapland and is sparsely populated. A large part of the area has been the habitat of reindeer herding Sami people for thousands of years and has for that reason been protected as a UNESCO World Heritage Site under the name Laponian area. The Laponian area is roughly divided into the eastern flatlands and the western mountainous region. There are several well-structured and well-maintained starting locations for those interested in experiencing the majestic wilderness. For instance, the Kvikkjokk basecamp provides excursions and has a high quality hostel.\n\nDue to the northern location, the aurora borealis can be experienced all through winter (November to March), and the midnight sun can be experienced during June and July.\n\nThe Lule River and the Lesser Lule River flows through the district. The rivers are heavily regulated for hydroelectricity, most of all in Sweden. 6 of the 10 largest hydroelectric plants are located in the area. This includes the 977 MW Harspr\u00e5nget, the 480 MW Porjus, and the 460 MW Messaure. There's a total of 11 hydroelectric plants in the area, 9 over 100 MW, 8 over 200 MW, and 4 over 400 MW.\n\nLocalities\nThere are three official localities (or urban areas) in Jokkmokk Municipality. The municipal seat is bolded:\n\nAdditional small settlements within the municipality include the Sami reindeer herding camp Udtja and the village of Puottaure.\n\nAttractions\n\nNational parks\nThe four national parks in Jokkmokk Municipality all have their own distinct identity. The national parks are Sarek, Muddus, Padjelanta and Stora Sj\u00f6fallet.\n\nThese national parks are popular with tourists all year around but the darkest and coldest months (November to January) are not recommended for beginners. The best period for sunshine and winter activities is from February all through April, when the snow lies deep and the days are long. This time of year the national parks are easily accessible by snowmobile and skis. Visitors should understand and respect that the wilderness is just that, and snowmobiles are not allowed in the parks at any time.\n\nThe summer in Jokkmokk Municipality is short but intense. The ground is free of snow from May until late October, early November. As with most areas in the Nordic countries, the actual warm period is quite short, but as Jokkmokk Municipality has a continental climate, the temperature can top 30 degrees Celsius in the summer and reach as low as -40 degrees Celsius in the winter. During the summer months hikers and other friends of nature converge in the national parks and this is also the time when most of the parks are most easily accessed. Visitors should be warned that the amount of mosquitoes can be difficult to those not used to them and driving has an added danger in the reindeer that seek shelter from the mosquitoes. Collisions with reindeer are frequent in most of the northern parts of the Nordic countries and drivers should keep an eye out.\n\nFall is also short and the shifting colors of the wide forests make the surroundings burn with color. This is a good time for hiking but due to the shifting temperatures the mountainous parts of the national parks can be treacherous for those unprepared.\n\nOther attractions\n\nJokkmokk is known for its Sami market held the first weekend every February. This market has been held for more than 400 consecutive years. Initially a gathering of traders from the entire region the market has long since grown to be more than a simple gathering of traders and is now a week-long cultural event with lectures, art exhibitions, concerts and much more.\n\nMining\n\nThere are iron ore deposits in the region, and the proposed Kallak mine, which has been met with resistance by activists, lies within the municipality. Mining exploration by British company Beowulf Mining has identified a potential mining site between the (non-Sami) villages of Bj\u00f6rkholmen and Randijaur, which forms part of the reindeer winter grazing lands of the Sami community of J\u00e5hk\u00e5gasska tjiellde.\n\nElections\n\nRiksdag\nThese are the results of the elections to the Riksdag since the 1972 municipal reform. Norrbotten Party also contested the 1994 election but due to the party's small size at a nationwide level SCB did not publish the party's results at a municipal level. The same applies to the Sweden Democrats between 1988 and 1998. \"Turnout\" denotes the percentage of eligible voters casting any ballots, whereas \"Votes\" denotes the number of actual valid ballots cast.\n\nBlocs\n\nThis lists the relative strength of the socialist and centre-right blocs since 1973, but parties not elected to the Riksdag are inserted as \"other\", including the Sweden Democrats results from 1988 to 2006, but also the Christian Democrats pre-1991 and the Greens in 1982, 1985 and 1991. The sources are identical to the table above. The coalition or government mandate marked in bold formed the government after the election. New Democracy got elected in 1991 but are still listed as \"other\" due to the short lifespan of the party.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nJokkmokk Municipality - Official site\nPorjus - Official site\nVuollerim - Official site \nTourist information\n\nMunicipalities of Norrbotten County\nS\u00e1mi-language municipalities\nLapland (Sweden)", "machine_text": "Jokkmokk Municipality is a rural municipality situated in the northern part of Sweden's Norrbotten County.

The economy of Jokkmokk Municipality is mainly dependent upon forestry, agriculture, and tourism. The municipality is home to a number of sawmills, pulp and paper mills, and bio-energy plants. Agriculture is primarily focused on the rearing of reindeer and sheep, and forestry is one of the major industries in the municipality, with large tracts of dense forests covering much of the region. In addition to its natural beauty, Jokkmokk Municipality is also home to several historic sites and landmarks. The municipality's most famous attraction is the Ajtte Museum, which houses a vast collection of Sami artifacts, dating from ancient times to the present day.

This apprenticeship instilled in him a passion for steam engines and hydraulics that would shape his future career. After completing his apprenticeship, Whitehouse worked for the Birmingham Water Works Company as an engineer. It was during this time that he began experimenting with hydraulic machinery and invented several innovative devices. In 1850, he developed the first hydraulic press, which was able to exert immense amounts of pressure and became widely used in industrial manufacturing processes. He also created hydraulic lifts for raising and lowering heavy loads and hydraulic cranes for lifting and moving heavy objects. Whitehouse's inventions revolutionized manufacturing and construction industries and helped to increase productivity and efficiency. In addition to hydraulic machinery, he also worked on steam engines and locomotives, improving their performance and reliability. He was regarded as an expert in his field and wrote several papers on hydraulic engineering that were widely read and respected. Whitehouse's achievements did not go unnoticed by the scientific community, and he was awarded the Royal Society's prestigious Telford Medal in 1875. He also became a fellow of the Royal Society and was elected to the Institution of Civil Engineers and the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. Despite his success, Whitehouse remained humble and dedicated to creating innovative and practical solutions to engineering problems. He passed away in 1905, leaving behind a legacy of groundbreaking hydraulic inventions that continue to play a vital role in modern manufacturing and construction industries.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 11663875}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Constitution of Uruguay\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Constitution of Uruguay () is the supreme law of Uruguay. Its first version was written in 1830 and its last amendment was made in 2004.\n\nUruguay's first constitution was adopted in 1830, following the conclusion of the three-year-long Cisplatine War in which Argentina and Uruguay acted as a federation: the United Provinces of the R\u00edo de la Plata. Mediated by the United Kingdom, the 1828 Treaty of Montevideo allowed to build the foundations for a Uruguayan state and constitution. It has been reformed in 1918, 1934, 1942, 1952 and 1967, but it still maintains several articles from its first version of 1830.\n\nVersions\n\nOriginal Constitution (1830 - 1918) \n\nWhen it became independent on August 25, 1825, the Oriental Republic of Uruguay (Rep\u00fablica Oriental del Uruguay) drew up its first constitution, which was promulgated on July 18, 1830. This text has been regarded as Uruguay's most technically perfect charter. Heavily influenced by the thinking of the French and American revolutions, it divided the government among the executive, legislative, and judicial powers and established Uruguay as a unitary republic with a centralized form of government. The bicameral General Assembly (Asamblea General) was empowered to elect a president with considerable powers to head the executive branch for a four-year term. The president was given control over all of his ministers of government and was empowered to make decisions with the agreement of at least one of the three ministers recognized by the 1830 constitution.\n\nLike all of Uruguay's charters since then, the 1830 constitution provided for a General Assembly composed of a Chamber of Senators (C\u00e1mara de Senadores), or Senate (Senado), elected nationally, and a Chamber of Representatives (C\u00e1mara de Representantes), elected from the departments. Members of the General Assembly were empowered to pass laws but lacked the authority to dismiss the president or his ministers or to issue votes of no confidence. An 1834 amendment, however, provided for juicio pol\u00edtico, or impeachment, of the ministers for \"unacceptable conduct\".\n\nAs established by the 1830 constitution, the Supreme Court of Justice (Suprema Corte de Justicia), and lesser courts, exercised the judicial power. The General Assembly appointed the members of the high court. The latter \u2013 with the consent of the Senate in the case of the appellate courts \u2013 appointed the members of the lesser courts. The constitution also divided the country into departments, each headed by a governor appointed by the president and each having an advisory body called a Neighbors' Council (Consejo de Vecinos).\n\nAlthough the 1830 constitution remained in effect for eighty-seven years, de facto governments violated it repeatedly. In the 1878-90 period, the Blancos and Colorados initiated the framework for a more stable system through understandings called \"pacts between the parties.\" This governing principle, called coparticipation (coparticipaci\u00f3n), meaning the sharing of formal political and informal bureaucratic power, has been formally practiced since 1872.\n\nThe anniversary of the 1830 promulgation of this original constitution on July 18 is now a public holiday in Uruguay.\n\nSecond Constitution (1918 - 1934) \n\nIn 1913 President Jos\u00e9 Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez (1903\u201307, 1911\u201315), the father of modern Uruguay, proposed a constitutional reform involving the creation of a Swiss-style collegial executive system to be called the colegiado. A strong opponent of the one-person, powerful presidency, Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez believed that a collective executive power would neutralize the dictatorial intentions of political leaders. It met intense opposition, however, not only from the Blancos but also from members of his own Colorado Party. The proposal was defeated in 1916, but Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez worked out a deal with a faction of the Blancos whereby a compromise system was provided for in the second constitution, which was approved by a plebiscite on 25 November 1917.\n\nThe history of successive constitutions is one of a lengthy struggle between advocates of the collegial system and those of the presidential system. Although the 1917 constitution worked well during the prosperous time after World War I, recurring conflicts between the president and the colegiado members made the executive power ineffective in coping with the economic and social crises wracking the country. These conflicts eventually led to the presidential coup of 1933. The ad hoc government suspended the constitution and appointed a constituent assembly to draw up a new one.\n\nThird Constitution (1934 - 1942) \n\nThe 1934 constitution abolished the colegiado and transferred its power to the president. Nevertheless, presidential powers remained somewhat limited. The executive power once again was exercised by a president who had to make decisions together with the ministers. The 1934 charter established the Council of Ministers (Consejo de Ministros) as the body in which these decisions were to be made. This council consisted of the president and the cabinet ministers. The constitution required the chief executive to appoint three of the nine cabinet ministers from among the members of the political party that received the second largest number of votes in the presidential election. The General Assembly, for its part, could issue votes of no confidence in cabinet ministers, with the approval of two-thirds of its members.\n\nThe constitution divided the Senate between the Blancos and the Colorados or, as political scientist Martin Weinstein has pointed out, between the Herrerist faction of the Blancos (named after Luis Alberto de Herrera) and the Terrist wing of the Colorados (named after Gabriel Terra; president, 1931\u201338). The party that garnered the second largest number of votes automatically received 50 percent of the Senate seats. In addition, the 1934 charter empowered the Supreme Court of Justice to rule on the constitutionality of the laws. This system, which lasted eighteen years, further limited the power of the president and his government.\n\nFourth Constitution (1942 - 1951) \n\nUruguay returned to a more democratic system in 1942.\n\nFifth Constitution (1951 - 1967) \n\nOn 13 July 1951, a formal pact between a fraction of the Colorados and the Herrerist Movement of the Blancos called for a plebiscite on constitutional reform. The plebiscite the following December 16 drew less than half of the 1.1 million voters to the polls, but the collegial system was approved by a small margin.\n\nA fourth constitution was promulgated on 25 January 1952 as the culmination of an effort to reestablish the colegiado and the plural executive power, the National Council of Government (Consejo Nacional de Gobierno), with six majority-party seats and three minority-party seats. This nine-member colegiado was ineffective because the president lacked control over the ministers and because the majority was seldom united. In the end, the ineffectiveness of these governments caused the public to turn against the colegiado arrangement.\n\nSixth Constitution (1967 - 1997) \n\nIn the elections of 27 November 1966, nearly 59 percent of Uruguayans voted to amend the 1952 constitution and to reestablish a presidential system of government, thus ending a fifteen-year experiment with the colegiado. The new constitution, which became operative on 15 February 1967, and has remained in effect since then, created a strong one-person presidency, subject to legislative and judicial checks. In free and fair elections, Uruguayans approved the new charter and elected the Colorado Party to power again.\n\nDictatorial period (1973-1985) \nIn 1976, however, the military government issued a series of constitutional decrees that amended the 1967 constitution by creating the Council of the Nation (Consejo de la Naci\u00f3n) to serve as the supreme governmental body, with executive and legislative functions. It consisted of the thirty members of the Council of State (Consejo de Estado), the body created by the regime in June 1973 to act in lieu of the General Assembly, which was dissolved by the regime and the twenty-eight senior officers of the armed forces (sixteen from the army, six from the navy, and six from the air force). The Council of the Nation appointed the president of the republic and the members of the Council of State, the Supreme Court of Justice, and the Tribunal of Administrative Claims, which was later dissolved in 1985. Eight institutional acts substituted for many of the functional provisions and guarantees of the 1967 constitution. For example, in addition to giving the Council of the Nation the power to appoint the president of the republic and to set general policy for the country, institutional acts deprived previous officeholders and candidates of their political rights and permitted the arbitrary dismissal of public employees.\n\nBack to institutionality \nIn 1985, Julio Mar\u00eda Sanguinetti was sworn in as the new democratically elected president, after 12 years of dictatorship. The military question was tough to address; after much political bargaining, at the end of December was passed the Expiry Law, which constituted an amnesty of sorts for military people who had committed human-rights abuses. The constitutionality of this law was challenged, but ultimately the citizens backed the law in a plebiscite held in April 1989.\n\nCurrent (1997 - present) \n\nThe 1967 Constitution is still in effect, though it was amended in 1989, 1994, 1996, and 2004. Though some consider the amendments of 1996 to have created a new constitution, Parliament continues to consider them changes to the Constitution of 1967.\n\nThe most important concepts that changed in 1996 were those related to elections. From 1999 onwards, the election cycle starts in June, with primary elections for all the parties, in order to choose single presidential candidates; in October, general elections are held, if no presidential candidate scores an absolute majority, a second round of voting is held in November; and finally, in May of the following year, municipal elections are held in all the Departments.\n\nSee also \n Uruguay\n Politics of Uruguay\n Constitution\n Constitutional law\n Constitutional economics\n Constitutionalism\n Elections in Uruguay\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Text of the Constitution including the reforms of 1989, 1994, 1996 y 2004 (in Spanish)\n \n\n \nUruguay\nPolitics of Uruguay\nUruguayan law", "machine_text": "The Constitution of Uruguay is the supreme law of the Oriental Republic of Uruguay, adopted on July 18, 1830.

The preamble declares that the Constitution is a result of the desire of the people of Uruguay to \"establish justice, secure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty.\" The Constitution establishes a system of government based on three branches: the executive, the legislative, and the judicial. The executive branch is headed by the President and includes a Cabinet of Ministers. The legislative branch is composed of two chambers, the Senate and the Chamber of Representatives. The judicial branch is headed by the Supreme Court of Justice.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Internal wave\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Internal waves are gravity waves that oscillate within a fluid medium, rather than on its surface. To exist, the fluid must be stratified: the density must change (continuously or discontinuously) with depth/height due to changes, for example, in temperature and/or salinity. If the density changes over a small vertical distance (as in the case of the thermocline in lakes and oceans or an atmospheric inversion), the waves propagate horizontally like surface waves, but do so at slower speeds as determined by the density difference of the fluid below and above the interface. If the density changes continuously, the waves can propagate vertically as well as horizontally through the fluid.\n\nInternal waves, also called internal gravity waves, go by many other names depending upon the fluid stratification, generation mechanism, amplitude, and influence of external forces. If propagating horizontally along an interface where the density rapidly decreases with height, they are specifically called interfacial (internal) waves. If the interfacial waves are large amplitude they are called internal solitary waves or internal solitons. If moving vertically through the atmosphere where substantial changes in air density influences their dynamics, they are called anelastic (internal) waves. If generated by flow over topography, they are called Lee waves or mountain waves. If the mountain waves break aloft, they can result in strong warm winds at the ground known as Chinook winds (in North America) or Foehn winds (in Europe). If generated in the ocean by tidal flow over submarine ridges or the continental shelf, they are called internal tides. If they evolve slowly compared to the Earth's rotational frequency so that their dynamics are influenced by the Coriolis effect, they are called inertia gravity waves or, simply, inertial waves. Internal waves are usually distinguished from Rossby waves, which are influenced by the change of Coriolis frequency with latitude.\n\nVisualization of internal waves\nAn internal wave can readily be observed in the kitchen by slowly tilting back and forth a bottle of salad dressing - the waves exist at the interface between oil and vinegar.\n\nAtmospheric internal waves can be visualized by wave clouds: at the wave crests air rises and cools in the relatively lower pressure, which can result in water vapor condensation if the relative humidity is close to 100%. Clouds that reveal internal waves launched by flow over hills are called lenticular clouds because of their lens-like appearance. Less dramatically, a train of internal waves can be visualized by rippled cloud patterns described as herringbone sky or mackerel sky. The outflow of cold air from a thunderstorm can launch large amplitude internal solitary waves at an atmospheric inversion. In northern Australia, these result in Morning Glory clouds, used by some daredevils to glide along like a surfer riding an ocean wave. Satellites over Australia and elsewhere reveal these waves can span many hundreds of kilometers.\n\nUndulations of the oceanic thermocline can be visualized by satellite because the waves increase the surface roughness where the horizontal flow converges, and this increases the scattering of sunlight (as in the image at the top of this page showing of waves generated by tidal flow through the Strait of Gibraltar).\n\nBuoyancy, reduced gravity and buoyancy frequency\nAccording to Archimedes principle, the weight of an immersed object is reduced by the weight of fluid it displaces. This holds for a fluid parcel of density  surrounded by an ambient fluid of density . Its weight per unit volume is , in which  is the acceleration of gravity. Dividing by a characteristic density, , gives the definition of the reduced gravity:\n\nIf ,  is positive though generally much smaller than . Because water is much more dense than air, the displacement of water by air from a surface gravity wave feels nearly the full force of gravity (). The displacement of the thermocline of a lake, which separates warmer surface from cooler deep water, feels the buoyancy force expressed through the reduced gravity. For example, the density difference between ice water and room temperature water is 0.002 the characteristic density of water. So the reduced gravity is 0.2% that of gravity. It is for this reason that internal waves move in slow-motion relative to surface waves.\n\nWhereas the reduced gravity is the key variable describing buoyancy for interfacial internal waves, a different quantity is used to describe buoyancy in continuously stratified fluid whose density varies with height as . Suppose a water column is in hydrostatic equilibrium and a small parcel of fluid with density  is displaced vertically by a small distance . The buoyant restoring force results in a vertical acceleration, given by\n\nThis is the spring equation whose solution predicts oscillatory vertical displacement about  in time about with frequency given by the buoyancy frequency:\n\nThe above argument can be generalized to predict the frequency, , of a fluid parcel that oscillates along a line at an angle  to the vertical:\n\n.\n\nThis is one way to write the dispersion relation for internal waves whose lines of constant phase lie at an angle  to the vertical. In particular, this shows that the buoyancy frequency is an upper limit of allowed internal wave frequencies.\n\nMathematical modeling of internal waves\n\nThe theory for internal waves differs in the description of interfacial waves and vertically propagating internal waves. These are treated separately below.\n\nInterfacial waves\n\nIn the simplest case, one considers a two-layer fluid in which a slab of fluid with uniform density  overlies a slab of fluid with uniform density . Arbitrarily the interface between the two layers is taken to be situated at  The fluid in the upper and lower layers are assumed to be irrotational. So the velocity in each layer is given by the gradient of a velocity potential,  and the potential itself satisfies Laplace's equation:\n\nAssuming the domain is unbounded and two-dimensional (in the  plane), and assuming the wave is periodic in  with wavenumber  the equations in each layer reduces to a second-order ordinary differential equation in . Insisting on bounded solutions the velocity potential in each layer is\n\nand\n\nwith  the amplitude of the wave and  its angular frequency. In deriving this structure, matching conditions have been used at the interface requiring continuity of mass and pressure. These conditions also give the dispersion relation:\n\nin which the reduced gravity  is based on the density difference between the upper and lower layers:\n\nwith  the Earth's gravity. Note that the dispersion relation is the same as that for deep water surface waves by setting\n\nInternal waves in uniformly stratified fluid\n\nThe structure and dispersion relation of internal waves in a uniformly stratified fluid is found through the solution of the linearized conservation of mass, momentum, and internal energy equations assuming the fluid is incompressible and the background density varies by a small amount (the Boussinesq approximation). Assuming the waves are two dimensional in the x-z plane, the respective equations are\n\nin which  is the perturbation density,  is the pressure, and  is the velocity. The ambient density changes linearly with height as given by  and , a constant, is the characteristic ambient density.\n\nSolving the four equations in four unknowns for a wave of the form  gives the dispersion relation\n\nin which  is the buoyancy frequency and  is the angle of the wavenumber vector to the horizontal, which is also the angle formed by lines of constant phase to the vertical.\n\nThe phase velocity and group velocity found from the dispersion relation predict the unusual property that they are perpendicular and that the vertical components of the phase and group velocities have opposite sign: if a wavepacket moves upward to the right, the crests move downward to the right.\n\nInternal waves in the ocean\n\nMost people think of waves as a surface phenomenon, which acts between water (as in lakes or oceans) and the air. Where low density water overlies high density water in the ocean, internal waves propagate along the boundary. They are especially common over the continental shelf regions of the world oceans and where brackish water overlies salt water at the outlet of large rivers. There is typically little surface expression of the waves, aside from slick bands that can form over the trough of the waves.\n\nInternal waves are the source of a curious phenomenon called dead water, first reported in 1893 by the Norwegian oceanographer Fridtjof Nansen, in which a boat may experience strong resistance to forward motion in apparently calm conditions. This occurs when the ship is sailing on a layer of relatively fresh water whose depth is comparable to the ship's draft. This causes a wake of internal waves that dissipates a huge amount of energy.\n\nProperties of internal waves\n\nInternal waves typically have much lower frequencies and higher amplitudes than surface gravity waves because the density differences (and therefore the restoring forces) within a fluid are usually much smaller. Wavelengths vary from centimetres to kilometres with periods of seconds to hours respectively.\n\nThe atmosphere and ocean are continuously stratified: potential density generally increases steadily downward. Internal waves in a continuously stratified medium may propagate vertically as well as horizontally. The dispersion relation for such waves is curious: For a freely-propagating internal wave packet, the direction of propagation of energy (group velocity) is perpendicular to the direction of propagation of wave crests and troughs (phase velocity). An internal wave may also become confined to a finite region of altitude or depth, as a result of varying stratification or wind. Here, the wave is said to be ducted or trapped, and a vertically standing wave may form, where the vertical component of group velocity approaches zero. A ducted internal wave mode may propagate horizontally, with parallel group and phase velocity vectors, analogous to propagation within a waveguide.\n\nAt large scales, internal waves are influenced both by the rotation of the Earth as well as by the stratification of the medium. The frequencies of these geophysical wave motions vary from a lower limit of the Coriolis frequency (inertial motions) up to the Brunt\u2013V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 frequency, or buoyancy frequency (buoyancy oscillations). Above the Brunt\u2013V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 frequency, there may be evanescent internal wave motions, for example those resulting from partial reflection. Internal waves at tidal frequencies are produced by tidal flow over topography/bathymetry, and are known as internal tides. Similarly, atmospheric tides arise from, for example, non-uniform solar heating associated with diurnal motion.\n\nOnshore transport of planktonic larvae\nCross-shelf transport, the exchange of water between coastal and offshore environments, is of particular interest for its role in delivering meroplanktonic larvae to often disparate adult populations from shared offshore larval pools. Several mechanisms have been proposed for the cross-shelf of planktonic larvae by internal waves. The prevalence of each type of event depends on a variety of factors including bottom topography, stratification of the water body, and tidal influences.\n\nInternal tidal bores\nSimilarly to surface waves, internal waves change as they approach the shore. As the ratio of wave amplitude to water depth becomes such that the wave \u201cfeels the bottom,\u201d water at the base of the wave slows down due to friction with the sea floor. This causes the wave to become asymmetrical and the face of the wave to steepen, and finally the wave will break, propagating forward as an internal bore. Internal waves are often formed as tides pass over a shelf break. The largest of these waves are generated during springtides and those of sufficient magnitude break and progress across the shelf as bores. These bores are evidenced by rapid, step-like changes in temperature and salinity with depth, the abrupt onset of upslope flows near the bottom and packets of high frequency internal waves following the fronts of the bores.\n\nThe arrival of cool, formerly deep water associated with internal bores into warm, shallower waters corresponds with drastic increases in phytoplankton and zooplankton concentrations and changes in plankter species abundances. Additionally, while both surface waters and those at depth tend to have relatively low primary productivity, thermoclines are often associated with a chlorophyll maximum layer. These layers in turn attract large aggregations of mobile zooplankton that internal bores subsequently push inshore. Many taxa can be almost absent in warm surface waters, yet plentiful in these internal bores.\n\nSurface slicks\nWhile internal waves of higher magnitudes will often break after crossing over the shelf break, smaller trains will proceed across the shelf unbroken. At low wind speeds these internal waves are evidenced by the formation of wide surface slicks, oriented parallel to the bottom topography, which progress shoreward with the internal waves. Waters above an internal wave converge and sink in its trough and upwell and diverge over its crest. The convergence zones associated with internal wave troughs often accumulate oils and flotsam that occasionally progress shoreward with the slicks. These rafts of flotsam can also harbor high concentrations of larvae of invertebrates and fish an order of magnitude higher than the surrounding waters.\n\nPredictable downwellings\nThermoclines are often associated with chlorophyll maximum layers. Internal waves represent oscillations of these thermoclines and therefore have the potential to transfer these phytoplankton rich waters downward, coupling benthic and pelagic systems. Areas affected by these events show higher growth rates of suspension feeding ascidians and bryozoans, likely due to the periodic influx of high phytoplankton concentrations. Periodic depression of the thermocline and associated downwelling may also play an important role in the vertical transport of planktonic larvae.\n\nTrapped cores\nLarge steep internal waves containing trapped, reverse-oscillating cores can also transport parcels of water shoreward. These non-linear waves with trapped cores had previously been observed in the laboratory and predicted theoretically. These waves propagate in environments characterized by high shear and turbulence and likely derive their energy from waves of depression interacting with a shoaling bottom further upstream. The conditions favorable to the generation of these waves are also likely to suspend sediment along the bottom as well as plankton and nutrients found along the benthos in deeper water.\n\nReferences\n\nFootnotes\n\nOther\n\nExternal links\nDiscussion and videos of internal waves made by an oscillating cylinder.\nAtlas of Oceanic Internal Waves - Global Ocean Associates\n\nAtmospheric dynamics\nFluid dynamics\nWaves\nWater waves", "machine_text": "Internal waves are waves that occur within a fluid medium, such as ocean currents, where the density changes gradually with depth. These waves differ from surface waves, which occur at the interface between fluids with different densities. Internal waves are generated by a variety of sources, such as tides and winds, and can propagate over long distances in the ocean. As the waves move through the fluid, they create areas of relatively high and low pressure, which can affect the movement of the surrounding water. One of the most important effects of internal waves is their impact on ocean mixing. As the waves propagate, they can interact with the horizontal and vertical gradients in density, leading to turbulent mixing and the transfer of energy and nutrients across different depths. This mixing has important implications for marine life, affecting the distribution of plankton and other organisms, as well as for ocean currents and climate models. Internal waves can also have significant effects on shipping and offshore structures, such as oil platforms. When these waves interact with the ocean floor, they can create strong currents that can damage the foundations and infrastructure of offshore structures. Researchers continue to study the complex dynamics of internal waves in order to better understand their impacts on ocean systems and to develop more accurate models to predict their behavior. Improving our knowledge of these waves and their interactions with the ocean can lead to better management of ocean resources and more effective mitigation of natural disasters such as tsunamis.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 900160}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Count (baseball)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "In baseball and softball, the count refers to the number of balls and strikes a batter has in their current plate appearance. It is usually announced as a pair of numbers, for example, 3-1 (pronounced as \"three and one,\" or, alternatively, \"a three-one count\"), with the first number being the number of balls and the second being the number of strikes. An individual pitch may also be referred to by the count prior to its delivery; for example, a pitch thrown with a count of three balls and one strike would be called a \"three-one pitch.\" A count of 1-1 or 2-2 is called even.  Zero is commonly pronounced \"oh,\" although a 0-0 count is rarely expressed as such \u2014 the count is typically not mentioned until at least one pitch has been thrown. If the count reaches three strikes, the batter strikes out, and if the count reaches four balls, the batter earns a base on balls (a \"walk\").\n\nAbout\nThe home plate umpire will signal the count with the number of balls on his left hand, and the number of strikes on his right hand.  (As a result, it reads backwards when viewed from the pitcher's point of view.)  Individual umpires vary in how frequently they give this signal; it is often done as a reminder when there has been a slight delay between pitches (such as the batter stepping out of the batter's box).  It can also be a signal to the scoreboard operator that an incorrect count is being shown on the board.  Some umpires may also give the count verbally, although usually only the batter and the catcher can hear it.\n\nAn important part of baseball statistics is measuring which counts are most likely to produce favorable outcomes for the pitcher or the hitter. Counts of 3-1 and 2-0 are considered hitters' counts, because the pitcher\u2014faced with the possibility of walking the batter\u2014is more likely to throw a ball in the strike zone, particularly a fastball. Somewhat surprisingly, in general, a 3-0 count tends to yield fewer hittable pitches, depending on the situation.  (Baseball fans have often suggested that this is because umpires are reluctant to call four straight balls and as a result \"ease up\" on the fourth pitch, treating it as having a wider strike zone.)  Often batters will take (not swing at) a 3-0 pitch, since the pitcher has missed the strike zone three straight times already, and a fourth would earn the batter a walk. This is a sound strategy because the batter is more likely to eventually reach base even if the count becomes 3-1 than he is if he puts the ball in play on 3-0. In some situations, it is also advantageous to take on 2-0 and 3-1.\n\nCounts with two strikes (except 3-2) are considered pitchers' counts.  An 0-2 count is very favorable to a pitcher.  In such a count, the pitcher has the freedom to throw one (or sometimes two) pitches out of the strike zone intentionally, in an attempt to get the batter to chase the pitch (swing at it), and strike out. Arguing as to whether a pitch was a ball or a strike (which is a judgment call by the umpire) is strictly prohibited by Major League Baseball rules.  Such an infringement, known as \"arguing balls and strikes,\" will quickly lead to a warning from the umpire, and the player or manager may be ejected from the game if they continue to argue.\n\nFull count\nA full count (sometimes called a full house, which is the usual term in softball) is the common name for a count where the batter has three balls and two strikes.  The term may derive from older scoreboards, which had three spaces for balls and two for strikes, since this is the maximum number of each that can be achieved before the plate appearance ends (such as with a strikeout, walk or hit). Many scoreboards still use light bulbs for this purpose, and thus a 3-2 count means all the bulbs are fully lit up. The alternative or variant term full house is likely to have been influenced by the poker term for a hand with three of a kind and a pair.\n\nAnother strike against the batter will result in a strikeout, while another ball will result in a walk.  However, a batter may maintain the two strikes indefinitely by hitting foul balls, so a full count does not always mean that only five pitches have been thrown, nor that there is only one more pitch to throw.\n\nA pitch which is thrown with a full count is often referred to as a \"payoff pitch\", since it is likely to be a good pitch for the batter to swing at.  With three balls already, the pitcher cannot afford to miss the strike zone, which would result in ball four and a walk for the batter.\n\nForced baserunners often will run on the pitch, even if they are not very fast runners, especially with two outs, as runners cannot be caught stealing or doubled off because the batter either will strike out to end the inning, walk to force the runners to advance if first base is occupied, or put the ball in play and an out would be the third in an inning (in the event of a foul ball, the runner must return to his original base).\n\nReferences\n\nBatting (baseball)\nBaseball pitching\nBaseball terminology", "machine_text": "Count (baseball) A count in baseball refers to the number of balls and strikes a player has accumulated during an at bat. The count is an important aspect of the game, as it can determine the strategy of both the pitcher and the batter. The count begins at 0-0, indicating no balls and no strikes. If the pitcher throws a pitch that the batter does not swing at and it misses the strike zone, it is called a ball. If the pitcher throws a pitch that the batter swings at and misses, it is called a strike. A pitch that is swung at and makes contact with the ball is also considered a strike, unless it is foul. When a batter accumulates three strikes, they are out and must leave the plate. When a batter accumulates four balls, they are awarded a base and must advance to first. The count can influence the strategy of the pitcher, who may choose to throw different types of pitches depending on the count. For example, if the pitcher has two strikes against the batter, they may try to throw a pitch that is very difficult to hit, such as a curveball or a slider. The count can also influence the strategy of the batter. If the batter has two strikes against them, they may be more cautious and try to protect the plate by taking a defensive swing. If the batter has a 3-0 count, meaning three balls and no strikes, they may be more likely to take a risk and swing at the next pitch, as they have a higher chance of getting on base. Overall, the count is an important aspect of baseball and can have a significant impact on the outcome of the game.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Mohicans\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Mohican ( or , alternate spelling: Mahican) are an Eastern Algonquian Native American tribe that historically spoke an Algonquian language. As part of the Eastern Algonquian family of tribes, they are related to the neighboring Lenape, who occupied territory to the south as far as the Atlantic coast. The Mohican occupied the upper tidal Hudson River Valley, including the confluence of the Mohawk River (where present-day Albany, New York, developed) and into western New England centered on the upper Housatonic River watershed. After 1680, due to conflicts with the powerful Mohawk to the west during the Beaver Wars, many were driven southeastward across the present-day Massachusetts western border and the Taconic Mountains to Berkshire County around Stockbridge, Massachusetts.\n \nThey combined with Lenape Native Americans (a branch known as the Munsee) in Stockbridge, and later the people moved west away from pressure of European settlement. They settled in what became Shawano County, Wisconsin. Most eastern American Indian populations were forced to reservations in Indian Territory during the 1830s, and other reservations in the American West later. Decades later they eventually formed the federally recognized Stockbridge-Munsee Community with registered members of the Munsee people and have a  reservation.\n\nFollowing the disruption of the American Revolutionary War, most of the Mohican descendants first migrated westward to join the Iroquois Oneida on their reservation in central New York. The Oneida gave them about 22,000 acres for their use. After more than two decades, in the 1820s and 1830s, the Oneida and the Stockbridge moved again, pressured to sell their lands and relocate to northeastern Wisconsin under the federal Indian Removal program. A group of Mohican also migrated to Ontario, Canada to live with the predominately Iroquois Six Nations of the Grand River reserve.\n\nThe tribe identified by the place where they lived:  (or \"people of the continually flowing waters\"). The word  refers to a great sea or body of water, and the Hudson River reminded them of their place of origin, so they named the Hudson River , or the river where there are people from the continually flowing waters. Therefore, they, along with other tribes living along the Hudson River (such as the Munsee to their west, known by the dialect of Lenape that they spoke, and Wappinger) to the south, were called \"the River Indians\" by the Dutch and English. \n\nThe Dutch heard and transliterated the term for the people of the area in their own language, variously as: Mahigan, Mahikander, Mahinganak, Maikan and Mawhickon, among other variants, which the English later expressed as Mohican or Mahican, in a transliteration to their own spelling system. The French, adopting names used by their Indian allies in Canada, knew the Mohican as the  (or wolves). They referred to the Iroquois Confederacy as the \"Snake People\", as they were called by some competitors, or \"Five Nations\", representing their original tribes).  Like the Munsee and Wappinger peoples, the Mohican were Algonquian-speaking, part of a large language family related also to the Lenape people, who occupied coastal areas from western Long Island to the Delaware River valley to the south.\n\nIn the late twentieth century, the Mohican joined other former New York tribes, including the Oneida and some other Iroquois nations, in filing land claims against New York for what were considered unconstitutional purchases of their lands after the Revolutionary War. Only the federal government had constitutional authority to deal with the Indian nations. In 2010, outgoing governor David Paterson announced a land exchange with the Stockbridge-Munsee that would enable them to build a large casino on  in Sullivan County in the Catskills, as a settlement in exchange for dropping their larger claim in Madison County. The deal had many opponents.\n\nTerritory\nIn their own language, the Mohican identified collectively as the , \"people of the great tidal river\".\n\nAt the time of their first contact with Europeans traders along the river in the 1590s, the Mohican were living in and around the Hudson River (or ). After 1609, at the time of the Dutch settlement of New Netherland, they also ranged along the eastern Mohawk River and the Hoosic River, and south along the Hudson to the Roeliff Jansen Kill, where they bordered on the Wappinger people. This nation inhabited the river area and its interior southward to today's New York City.\n\nMost of the Mohican communities lay along the upper tidal reaches of the Hudson River and along the watersheds of Kinderhook-Claverack-Taghkanic Creek, the Roeliff Jansen Kill, Catskil Creek, and adjacent areas of the Housatonic watershed. Mohican territory reached along Hudson River watersheds northeastward to Wood Creek just south of Lake Champlain.\n\nCulture\nThe Mohican villages were governed by hereditary sachems advised by a council of clan elders. They had a matrilineal kinship system, with property and inheritance (including such hereditary offices) passed through the maternal line. Moravian missionary John Heckewelder and early anthropologist Lewis H. Morgan both learned from Mohican informants that their matrilineal society was divided into three phratries (Turkey, Turtle, and Wolf). These were divided into clans or subclans, including a potentially prominent Bear Clan. This finding is supported by the evidence of Mohican signatures on treaties and land deeds (see the works of Shirley Dunn).\n\nA general council of sachems met regularly at Scodac (east of present-day Albany) to decide important matters affecting the entire confederacy. In his history of the Indians of the Hudson River, Edward Manning Ruttenber described the clans of the Mohican as the Bear, the Turkey, the Turtle, and the Wolf. Each had a role in the lives of the people, and the Wolf served as warriors in the north to defend against the Mohawk, the easternmost of the Five Nations of the Iroquois.\n\nLike the Munsee-speaking communities to their south, Mohican villages followed a dispersed settlement pattern, with each community likely dominated by a single lineage or clan. The villages usually consisted of a small cluster of small and mid-sized longhouses, and were located along floodplains. During times of war, they built fortifications in defensive locations (such as along ridges) as places of retreat. Their cornfields were located near their communities; the women also cultivated varieties of squash, beans, sunflowers, and other crops from the Eastern Agricultural Complex. Horticulture and the gathering and processing of nuts (hickory, butternuts, black walnuts and acorns), fruits (blueberries, raspberries, juneberries among many others), and roots (groundnuts, wood lilies, arrowroot among others) provided much of their diet. This was supplemented by the men hunting game (turkeys, deer, elk, bears, and moose in the Taconics) and fishing (sturgeon, alewives, shad, eels, lamprey and striped bass).\n\nLanguage\nThe now extinct Mohican language belonged to the Eastern Algonquian branch of the Algonquian language family.\n\nHistory\n\nMohican Confederacy\nThe Mohican were a confederacy of five tribes and as many as forty villages.\n Mohican proper, lived in the vicinity of today's Albany (, \"the fireplace of the Mahican Nation\") west towards the Mohawk River and to the northwest to Lake Champlain and Lake George\n , lived along the west shore of the Hudson River above the Catskill Creek\nWawyachtonoc (or ,  \"eddy people\" or \"people of the curving channel\"), lived in Dutchess County and Columbia County eastward to the Housatonic River in Litchfield County, Connecticut, main village was Weantinock, additional villages: Shecomeco, Wechquadnach, Pamperaug, Bantam, Weataug, Scaticook\n Westenhuck (from , \"on the other side of the mountains\"), the name of a village near Great Barrington, Massachusetts. Often called the \"Housatonic people\", they lived in the Housatonic Valley in Connecticut and Massachusetts and in the vicinity of Great Barrington, which they called , meaning \"the place downstream\"\n Wiekagjoc (from , \"upper reaches of a river\"), lived east of the Hudson Rivers near the city of Hudson, Columbia County, New York\n\nConflict with the Mohawk \n\nThe Algonquians (Mohican) and Iroquois (Mohawk) were traditional competitors and enemies. Iroquois oral tradition, as recorded in the Jesuit Relations, speaks of a war between the Mohawks and an alliance of the Susquehannock and Algonquin (sometime between 1580 and 1600). This was perhaps in response to the formation of the League of the Iroquois.\n\nIn September 1609 Henry Hudson encountered Mohican villages just below present day Albany, with whom he traded goods for furs. Hudson returned to Holland with a cargo of valuable furs which immediately attracted Dutch merchants to the area. The first Dutch fur traders arrived on the Hudson River the following year to trade with the Mohicans. Besides exposing them to European epidemics, the fur trade destabilized the region.\n\nIn 1614, the Dutch decided to establish a permanent trading post on Castle Island, on the site of a previous French post that had been long abandoned; but first they had to arrange a truce to end fighting which had broken out between the Mohicans and Mohawks. Fighting broke out again between the Mohicans and Mohawks in 1617, and with Fort Nassau badly damaged by a freshet, the Dutch abandoned the fort. In 1618, having once again negotiated a truce, the Dutch rebuilt Fort Nassau on higher ground. Late that year, Fort Nassau was destroyed by flooding and abandoned for good. In 1624, Captain Cornelius Jacobsen May sailed the  upriver and landed eighteen families of Walloons on a plain opposite Castle Island. They commenced to construct Fort Orange.\n\nThe Mohicans invited the Algonquin and Montagnais to bring their furs to Fort Orange as an alternate to French traders in Quebec. Seeing the Mohicans extended their control over the fur trade, the Mohawk attacked, with initial success. In 1625 or 1626 the Mohicans destroyed the easternmost Iroquois \"castle\". The Mohawks then re-located south of the Mohawk River, closer to Fort Orange. In July 1626 many of the settlers moved to New Amsterdam because of the conflict. The Mohicans requested help from the Dutch and Commander Daniel Van Krieckebeek set out from the fort with six soldiers. Van Krieckebeek, three soldiers, and twenty-four Mohicans were killed when their party was ambushed by the Mohawk about a mile from the fort. The Mohawks withdrew with some body parts of those slain for later consumption as a demonstration of supremacy.\n\nWar continued to rage between the Mohicans and Mohawks throughout the area from Skahn\u00e9htati (Schenectady) to Kinderhoek Kinderhook. By 1629, the Mohawks had taken over territories on the west bank of the Hudson River that were formerly held by the Mohicans. The conflict caused most of the Mohican to migrate eastward across the Hudson River into western Massachusetts and Connecticut.  The Mohawks gained a near-monopoly in the fur trade with the Dutch by prohibiting the nearby Algonquian-speaking tribes to the north or east to trade.\n\nStockbridge\nMany Mohicans settled in the town of Stockbridge, Massachusetts, where they gradually became known as the \"Stockbridge Indians\". , one of their chiefs, accompanied three Mohawk chiefs on a state visit to Queen Anne and her government in England in 1710. They were popularly referred to as the Four Mohawk Kings.\n\nThe Stockbridge Indians allowed Protestant missionaries, including Jonathan Edwards, to live among them.  In the 18th century, many converted to Christianity, while keeping certain traditions of their own.  They fought on the side of the British colonists in the French and Indian War (also known as the Seven Years' War).  During the American Revolution, they sided with the colonists.\n\nIn the eighteenth century, some of the Mohicans developed strong ties with missionaries of the Moravian Church from Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, who founded a mission at their village of  in Dutchess County, New York. Henry Rauch reached out to two Mohican leaders, , also known as ; and , who took him back to Shekomeko. They named him the new religious teacher. Over time, Rauch won listeners, as the Mohicans had suffered much from disease and warfare, which had disrupted their society. Early in 1742, Shabash and two other Mohicans accompanied Rauch to Bethlehem, where he was to be ordained as a deacon. The three Mohicans were baptized on 11 February 1742 in John de Turk's barn nearby at Oley, Pennsylvania. Shabash was the first Mohican of Shekomeko to adopt the Christian religion. The Moravians built a chapel for the Mohican people in 1743. They defended the Mohican against European colonists' exploitation, trying to protect them against land encroachment and abuses of liquor.\n\nOn a 1738 visit to New York, the Mohicans spoke to Governor Lewis Morris concerning the sale of their land near Shekomeko. The Governor promised they would be paid as soon as the lands were surveyed.  He suggested that for their own security, they should mark off their square mile of land they wished to keep, which the Mohicans never did. In September 1743, still under the Acting-Governor George Clarke the land was finally surveyed by New York Assembly agents and divided into lots, a row of which ran through the Indians' reserved land. With some help from the missionaries, on 17 October 1743 and already under the new Royal Governor George Clinton, Shabash put together a petition of names of people who could attest that the land in which one of the lots was running through was theirs. Despite Shabash's appeals, his persistence, and the missionaries' help, the Mohicans lost the case. The lots were eventually bought up by European-American colonists and the Mohicans were forced out of Shekomeko. Some who opposed the missionaries' work accused them of being secret Catholic Jesuits (who had been outlawed from the colony in 1700) and of working with the Mohicans on the side of the French. The missionaries were summoned more than once before colonial government, but also had supporters. In the late 1740s the colonial government at Poughkeepsie expelled the missionaries from New York, in part because of their advocacy of Mohican rights. European colonists soon took over the Mohican land.\n\nRevolutionary War\n\nIn August 1775, the Six Nations staged a council fire near Albany, after news of Bunker Hill had made war seem imminent. After much debate, they decided that such a war was a private affair between the British and the colonists (known as Rebels, Revolutionaries, Congress-Men, American Whigs, or Patriots), and that they should stay out of it. Mohawk Chief Joseph Brant feared that the Indians would lose their lands if the Colonists achieved independence. Sir William Johnson, his son John Johnson and son-in-law Guy Johnson and Brant used all their influence to engage the Iroquois to fight for the British cause. The Mohawk, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca ultimately became allies and provided warriors for the battles in the New York area. The Oneida and Tuscarora sided with the Colonists. The Mohicans, who as Algonquians were not part of the Iroquois Confederacy, sided with the Patriots, serving at the Siege of Boston, and the battles of Saratoga and Monmouth.\n\nIn 1778 they lost forty warriors of their Stockbridge Militia, around half \"Stockbridge Indians\" who were remnants of both Mohican and Wappinger tribes, in a British attack on the land of the van Cortlandt family. (In 1888, the property became Van Courtland Park in the Bronx, New York.) The Battle of Kingsbridge decimated the troop's ranks.  It received a commendation from George Washington, was paid $1,000 and dismissed.\n\nMove to Oneida, New York\nAfter the Revolution the citizens of the new United States forced many Native Americans off their land and westward. In the 1780s, groups of Stockbridge Indians, today regarded as Stockbridge Munsee, moved from Massachusetts to a new location among the Oneida people in central New York, who had been granted a  reservation for their service to the Patriots, out of their former territory of . They called their settlement New Stockbridge. Some individuals and families, mostly people who were old or those with special ties to the area, remained behind at Stockbridge.\n\nThe central figures of Mohican society, including the chief sachem, Joseph Quanaukaunt, and his counselors and relatives, were part of the move to New Stockbridge. At the new town, the Stockbridge emigrants controlled their own affairs and combined traditional ways with the new as they chose. After learning from the Christian missionaries, the Stockbridge Indians were experienced in English ways. At New Stockbridge they replicated their former town. While continuing as Christians, they retained their language and Mohican cultural traditions. In general, their evolving Mohican identity was still rooted in traditions of the past.\n\nRemoval to Wisconsin\nIn the 1820s and 1830s, most of the Stockbridge Indians moved to Shawano County, Wisconsin, where they were promised land by the US government under the policy of Indian removal. In Wisconsin, they settled on reservations with the Lenape (called Munsee after one of their major dialects), who were also speakers of one of the Algonquian languages.  Together, the two formed a band and are federally recognized as the Stockbridge-Munsee Community.\n\nTheir 22,000-acre reservation is known as that of the Stockbridge-Munsee Band of Mohican Indians and is located near the town of Bowler. Since the late twentieth century, they have developed the North Star Mohican Resort and Casino on their reservation, which has successfully generated funds for tribal welfare and economic development.\n\nLand claims\nIn the late twentieth century, the Stockbridge-Munsee were among tribes filing land claims against New York, which had been ruled to have unconstitutionally acquired land from Indians without Senate ratification. The Stockbridge-Munsee filed a land claim against New York state for  in Madison County, the location of its former property. In 2011, outgoing governor David Paterson announced having reached a deal with the tribe. They would be given nearly  in Madison County and give up their larger claim in exchange for the state's giving them 330 acres of land in Sullivan County in the Catskill Mountains, where the government was trying to encourage economic development. The federal government had agreed to take the land in trust, making it eligible for development as a gaming casino, and the state would allow gaming, an increasingly important source of revenue for American Indians. Race track and casinos, private interests and other tribes opposed the deal.\n\nIn 2011, the Stockbridge-Munsee Community Band of the Mohican Indians regained ownership 156 acres along the Hudson River, a tract known as Papscanee Island Nature Preserve near East Greenbush and Schodack. The land was donated to descendants of its indigenous inhabitants by the Open Space Initiative. Prior to colonization, the island was used for ceremonies by the Mohicans before it was acquired by Dutch merchant Kiliaen Van Rensselaer in 1637. The property is managed by Rensselaer County and the Rensselaer Land Trust for public access and protection, while owned by the Mohicans.\n\nRepresentation in media\nJames Fenimore Cooper based his novel, The Last of the Mohicans, on the Mohican tribe. His description includes some cultural aspects of the Mohegan, a different Algonquian tribe that lived in eastern Connecticut. Cooper set his novel in the Hudson Valley, Mohican land, but used some Mohegan names for his characters, such as Uncas.\n\nThe novel has been adapted for the cinema more than a dozen times, the first time in 1920. Michael Mann directed a 1992 adaptation, which starred Daniel Day-Lewis as a Mohican-adopted white man.\n\nNotable members\n Etow Oh Koam, Mohican sachem and one of the Four Indian Kings, who, with three Mohawk leaders, made a state visit to Queen Anne and her government in England in 1710.\n Hendrick Aupaumut, (1757\u20131830) sachem, historian, and American Revolutionary War captain\n Steve Conliff, (1949-2006) political writer, historian, Yippie activist\n Brent Michael Davids, (b. 1959) composer/flautist \n Bill Miller, (b. 1955) musician\n Electa Quinney, (1798\u20131885) first public teacher and school mistress in Wisconsin\n John Wannuaucon Quinney, (1797\u20131855) diplomat\n Don Coyhis (born August 16, 1943), addiction specialist, Native American health activist and author.\n\nSee also \n Native American tribes in Massachusetts\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n Aupaumut, Hendrick.

The name \"Mohican\" means \"the people of the waters that are never still\" or \"people of the continually moving waters.\" Their traditional territory also extended into western Massachusetts and southwestern Vermont. The Mohicans were a member of the Algonquian language family. They were known for their hunting and fishing skills and were also skilled in agriculture, growing crops such as corn, beans, and squash. The Mohicans were organized into several clans, each with its own leaders and customs. European contact with the Mohicans began in the 1600s when Dutch traders arrived in the region. The Mohicans were initially friendly with the Dutch, but conflicts arose as other European powers began to encroach upon their territories. The Mohicans sided with the British during the American Revolution, and their traditional lands were eventually taken over by the new United States of America. Today, the Mohicans are recognized as a sovereign nation by the United States Government with their own constitution and tribal council. They are also known for their rich cultural heritage and continue to celebrate their traditions through music, dance, and other cultural activities. One of the most well-known works of literature featuring the Mohicans is James Fenimore Cooper's 1826 novel The Last of the Mohicans, which tells the story of a Mohican named Hawkeye who assists British soldiers during the French and Indian War. The novel has been adapted into several films and stage productions. Despite their struggles, the Mohicans remain a vibrant and resilient community, dedicated to preserving their heritage and traditions for future generations to enjoy and appreciate.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 63928}

It plays a crucial role in the dissemination of scientific knowledge, facilitating collaboration and fostering innovation. Effective scientific communication entails sharing research findings, discussing ideas, and interpreting data in an accessible and comprehensible way. The goal of scientific communication is to make scientific knowledge accessible to a wider audience, including the general public, policymakers, and other stakeholders. At its core, scientific communication aims to create a shared understanding of the scientific process and its impact on society. Through effective communication, scientists can build stronger relationships with the public, promote scientific literacy, and facilitate informed decision-making. There are many forms of scientific communication, including peer-reviewed journal articles, research reports, conference presentations, and public outreach events. Each form of communication serves a different purpose and requires a different set of skills. For example, writing a journal article requires a strong command of scientific writing conventions and an ability to distill complex research findings into a clear and concise message. Public outreach events, on the other hand, require the ability to communicate scientific ideas in a way that is engaging and accessible to a general audience. In recent years, scientific communication has become increasingly important as the scientific community grapples with issues such as climate change, public health, and emerging technologies. Effective communication has become essential for promoting evidence-based decision-making and combating misinformation and pseudoscience. Overall, scientific communication plays a vital role in shaping public perceptions of science and promoting the use of scientific evidence to inform policy and practice. As such, it is essential for scientists to build strong communication skills and to prioritize effective communication in their research endeavors.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 31342356}

Harrah's is one of the largest hotels in New Jersey.\n\nThe casino is one of three in the marina district of the city, along with the Borgata and the Golden Nugget. Harrah's was the first to be located in the district and remained the only resort there until Trump's Castle (later Trump Marina, now the Golden Nugget) was opened in 1985. It was the fifth casino to open after the legalization of gambling.\n\nHistory\nHarrah's Atlantic City was conceived, and initial construction started, by a partnership of LM Walters Co and Holiday Inns. It was originally to be named the \"Holiday Inn Marina Casino\". Holiday Inns purchased Harrah's Corporation, following the death of Harrah's founder Bill Harrah, during construction of the facility. Though Bill Harrah did not participate in the new casino's development, the facility was re-branded Harrah's Marina Resort prior to opening. The new casino was located in the marina district \u2013 the first casino in Atlantic City not located on the famous boardwalk. Harrah's Waterfront Tower rises 46 stories above the Marina in Atlantic City.\n\nHarrah's opened on Saturday November 22, 1980 with a 506-room hotel tower, now known as the Coastal Tower, and became the top-grossing casino in the city. In 1986, Harrah's opened the new all-suite Atrium Tower, due to the complex's popularity and the opening of Trump's Castle across the road. Another expansion occurred in 1997 with the opening of the Marina Tower. The Harbour, Atrium, and Marina towers each stand at 16 stories tall, and the Atrium Tower is connected to the Coastal and Marina towers by hallways on each floor. In 2002, the 25-story Bayview Tower opened, along with expanded gaming space.\n\nThe Waterfront Tower opened in 2008, along with a new pool and a spa, to better compete with the nearby Borgata, which opened in 2003.

On a square footage basis, this installation is believed to be the largest exterior LED display surface in the world.\n\nIn November 2016, Harrah's began renovating the 450 Bayview rooms/suites. The rooms will look like the ones in the Valley Tower at Harrah's in Las Vegas. Floors 4, 5, & 6 were done before Christmas 2016 and opened on December 23, 2016. The full renovations were completed in 2017. In late 2018, Harrah's announced its 507 room/suite Harbour Tower would be renamed the Coastal Tower and completely renovated to look similar to the recently renovated Bayview Tower rooms. The first set of rooms will open on Thursday February 7th, 2019, and the rest of the rooms should be completed by summer 2019.\n\nIn July 2020, Eldorado Resorts acquired Caesars Entertainment, taking over operations of the property. In connection with that acquisition, Vici Properties bought the real estate of Harrah's Atlantic City for $599 million and leased it back to Eldorado (newly renamed as Caesars Entertainment).\n\nRestaurants and shops\nHarrah's features a variety of restaurants, both for fine and casual dining (including a restaurant by Gordon Ramsay), and a small collection of stores.\n\nEntertainment\nThe 800-seat Broadway by the Bay Theater opened on December 31, 1980, with singing team Sandler and Young.

Offseason Moves The 49ers made some big moves during the offseason in preparation for the 2022 season. The most notable of these was the trade for superstar quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who joins the team after spending his entire career with the Green Bay Packers. The 49ers sent future draft picks and some current players to the Packers to acquire Rodgers. The team also signed several free agents, including wide receiver Curtis Samuel, cornerback Donte Jackson, and linebacker Richard Sherman. Draft In the 2022 NFL Draft, the 49ers had the 16th overall pick. With this pick, the team selected cornerback Ahmad Gardner from the University of Cincinnati. Gardner was considered one of the best cornerbacks in the draft, and is expected to immediately contribute to the team's defense. Regular Season The 2022 season will begin on September 11th, when the 49ers host the Arizona Cardinals. The team will play 17 games during the regular season, as the NFL has expanded its schedule from 16 to 17 games for the first time. The 49ers will face each of their divisional opponents twice, as well as teams from the AFC and NFC North divisions. Expectations With the addition of Rodgers and other key players during the offseason, expectations for the 49ers are high in 2022.

The name Phaq'u Q'awa comes from the region's indigenous Aymara language and translates to \"red river,\" likely due to the sediment and minerals that give the water a distinct reddish hue. The river has played a significant role in the development of La Paz since its founding in the late 16th century. Initially used for irrigation by the native peoples, it soon became a means for transportation and commerce for both indigenous communities and Spanish colonizers. As the city grew, the river was also utilized for washing clothes and bathing. Today, Phaq'u Q'awa is a popular attraction for tourists and locals alike. Its rushing waters and surrounding scenery make it a favorite spot for outdoor activities such as hiking, fishing, and kayaking. The river is also home to a variety of flora and fauna, including trout, frogs, and birds such as the Andean gull.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Proto-Afroasiatic language\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Proto\u2013Afroasiatic, sometimes referred to as Proto-Afrasian, is the reconstructed proto-language from which all modern Afroasiatic languages are descended. Though estimations vary widely, it is believed by scholars to have been spoken as a single language around 12,000 to 18,000 years ago (12 to 18 kya), that is, between 16,000 and 10,000 BC. The reconstruction of Proto-Afroasiatic is problematic and remains largely lacking. Moreover, no consensus exists as to the location of the Afroasiatic Urheimat, the putative homeland of Proto-Afroasiatic speakers.\n\nUrheimat\n\nA commonly proposed homeland is northeast Africa, particularly in or near Ethiopia, in part due to the presence of many branches of the family in and near that region (and in Africa). According to others, words for fauna and flora and evidence of linguistic contact with language families known to have been spoken in Eurasia suggest that its home was in the Middle East, probably the Levant. Some geneticists and archaeologists have argued for a back migration of proto-Afroasiatic speakers from Western Asia to Africa as early as the 10th millennium BC. It has been suggested that the Natufian culture might have spoken a proto-Afroasian language just prior to its disintegration into sub-languages. The hypothesis is supported by the Afroasiatic terms for early livestock and crops in Anatolia and Iran, but would then imply that branches other than Semitic developed outside of the proposed homeland. According to linguist V\u00e1clav Bla\u017eek, the possibility a language similar to Cushitic being formerly spoken originally in the south of Arabia also speaks for a Middle Eastern origin. But some other proposals posit Northern Africa or the Horn of Africa as possible places of origin.\n\nConsonant correspondences\nThe following table shows consonant correspondences in Afroasiatic languages, as given in Dolgopolsky (1999), along with some reconstructed consonants for Proto-Afroasiatic.\n\n under special conditions \n\nNOTE:\n = \nSymbols with dots underneath are emphatic consonants (variously glottalized, ejective or pharyngealized).\nTranscription of Ancient Egyptian follows Allen (2000); see Transliteration of Ancient Egyptian.

There are other proposed cognate sets:\n\n\"six\": Egyptian , Proto-Semitic , Berber (Tamazight) .\n\"seven\": Egyptian , Proto-Semitic , Berber (Tamazight) .\n\nGrammar\nIt has been proposed that Proto-Afroasiatic had marked nominative case marking, where the subject was overtly marked for nominative case, while the object appeared in unmarked default case. Marked nominative case marking is still found in languages of the Cushitic, Omotic and Berber branches. Its syntax possibly featured an exclusively default, strict word ordering of VSO. Although some Afroasiatic languages have developed free word order, it is generally surmised that PAA was originally a VO language.\n\nSee also \nAfroasiatic phonetic notation\nNostratic languages\nProto-Afroasiatic reconstructions (Wiktionary)\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography \n\n \n\nAfro-Asiatic\nAfroasiatic languages", "machine_text": "Proto-Afroasiatic language is a hypothetical ancestral language of the Afroasiatic language family. This language is believed to have existed thousands of years ago in the areas of the Horn of Africa and the Nile River Valley. The Proto-Afroasiatic language is considered to be the root of all the languages in the Afroasiatic family, including Arabic, Hebrew, Amharic, Somali, and Berber. The existence of the Proto-Afroasiatic language has been inferred through comparative linguistics, which is the study of the similarities and differences between languages. Comparative linguistics seeks to identify common linguistic features between related languages and to reconstruct the ancestral language from which they came. By comparing the sounds, grammar, and vocabulary of different Afroasiatic languages, linguists have been able to reconstruct what they believe to be the Proto-Afroasiatic language. The reconstruction of the Proto-Afroasiatic language is an ongoing process that involves the collaboration of linguists from different parts of the world. One of the biggest challenges in reconstructing the Proto-Afroasiatic language is the lack of written records. Most of the languages in the Afroasiatic family are oral languages, and the earliest written records of these languages date back only a few thousand years. Despite these challenges, linguists have been able to reconstruct many aspects of the Proto-Afroasiatic language. For example, it is believed that the Proto-Afroasiatic language had a series of consonants that were pronounced farther back in the mouth than the consonants of most modern Afroasiatic languages. This means that the Proto-Afroasiatic language had sounds that are not present in the modern Afroasiatic languages. The reconstruction of the Proto-Afroasiatic language has led to a deeper understanding of the history and development of the languages of the Afroasiatic family. It has also shed light on the cultural and linguistic connections between the different peoples who speak these languages.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Tangzhuang\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "A tangzhuang (\u5510\u88dd) is a kind of Manchu jacket with a straight collar. It is an updated form of the Qing magua, itself a more fashionable adaptation of the riding jacket once worn by Manchu horsemen.\n\nName\nT\u00e1ngzhu\u0101ng is the pinyin romanization of the Mandarin pronunciation of the clothes' Chinese name, written as  in traditional characters and as  in the simplified characters now used in mainland China. Its spelling may vary a little in other romanizations or dialects. It is also sometimes translated as a  or jacket.\n\nAlthough the name of the jacket in English and Chinese suggests an origin during (or at least reference to) the Tang period of Chinese history, it was actually intended by its designers to mean a \"Chinese\" outfit. In fact, \u201cTangzhuang\u201d is basically the Chinese style of dress in the late Qing Dynasty. The origin of the term \u201cTangzhuang\u201d also has a taste of \u201cexport to domestic sales\u201d. Foreigners call \u201cChina town\u201d as \u201cTang People Street\u201d, and naturally call Chinese clothing \u201cTangzhuang\u201d. In southern China and among the Chinese diaspora, dialects like Cantonese refer to ethnic Chinese\u2014as opposed to all Chinese nationals\u2014as \"Tang people\" rather than \"Han\". It is thus also sometimes translated as a  After criticism of the misleading name appeared in various Chinese media, some of its designers and some government officials began to call the garment the \"new tangzhuang\" or  but neither name lasted. Instead, most Chinese people came to accept the designers' original name for the garment and some even expanded it to describe any form of traditional Chinese clothing.\n\nHistory\n\nMagua\n\nThe tangzhuang is an adaption of the Manchu \"horse jacket\" (magua), a waist- or three-quarter-length front-opening jacket or surcoat. This was initially worn\u2014usually in a dark blue color\u2014by Manchu horsemen, but became mandatory for Han officials' clothing under the Qing Empire. Over time, it evolved from a protective apron for the changshan into an item of Chinese fashion in its own right and even a mark of imperial favor. Its use then spread among the common Han, including among the Chinese diaspora abroad. \n\nFollowing the 1911 Xinhai Revolution and 1949 Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War, the \"Mao suit\" (Zh\u014dngsh\u0101n zhu\u0101ng) gradually displaced the changshan and magua in most contexts. After the fall of the Gang of Four in the late 1970s and the beginning of Deng Xiaoping's Opening Up Policy in the 1980s, traditional clothing began to experience a revival in mainland China. Variants of the magua became noticeably more common in Chinese fashion from the mid-1990s.\n\n2001 APEC Summit\n\nIn 1993, US president Bill Clinton tried to bring trade talks back on track by inviting the heads of the APEC member economies to personally attend what had until then been a ministerial conference. He requested leaders' clothes remain informal and presented each with a leather bomber jacket bearing the APEC logo as a memento. The next year, Indonesia followed suit and presented batik shirts; the world leaders then humored Suharto's request that they wear them for a group photo. The tradition developed that the summits' hosts would present traditional and representative clothes from their cultures, and the leaders would wear them on the last day of the conference as a show of solidarity.\n\nAhead of the first occasion of China's hosting the summit in 2001, state-run media acquainted the Chinese with the custom, prompting speculation as to what China's \"traditional clothes\" might be: Mao suits had been displaced by western-style suits; minority groups often had recognizable ethnic costumes but styles of Han clothing (h\u00e0nf\u00fa) had varied from dynasty to dynasty, with the most recent Qing forms heavily influenced by the Manchus and their oppressive dress codes. Although these designs were among the 40 presented to the Chinese government over the span of a year, their foreign origin or political connotations led officials to select an \"ambiguously traditional\" design by Shanghainese clothiers Li Jianqin (, L\u01d0 Ji\u00e0nq\u00edn) and Yu Ying (t s Y\u00fa Y\u012bng) and by five others at Qinyi (t s Q\u00edny\u00ec F\u00fash\u00ec) and the Shanghai Garment Group (t s Sh\u00e0ngh\u01cei F\u00fazhu\u0101ng J\u00edtu\u00e1n). \n\nThe jackets given to the APEC leaders were a blend of Chinese motifs and western design, made from silk supposedly artificially enhanced to be stronger, softer, more wrinkle-resistant, more water-absorbent, and better ventilated, with longer-lasting and brighter colors. They featured cotton knotwork instead of buttons and a design of peonies surrounding the letters \"APEC\". The jackets were handmade but not personally sized; instead, they were fitted using stand-ins and body doubles, with a partially-completed backup available in case those measurements were mistaken. The leaders had a choice among scarlet, azure, green, brown, maroon, and black versions; each came in a matching silk bag adorned with the APEC logo and each had an off-white silk shirt to wear beneath it. The 20 attendees\u2014the leaders of all the APEC member economies except \"Chinese Taipei\"\u2014mostly opted for the red-and-black or blue-and-gold design and wore the jackets to their meetings at the Shanghai Science and Technology Museum on 21 October 2001 and for the \"Leaders' Family Portrait\" afterwards that closed the event.\n\nTangzhuang craze\nThe tangzhuang's use as the representative unisex Chinese clothing for the \"Leaders' Family Portrait\" immediately led to its more widespread popularity, spreading from Beijing to other large towns around the country as far afield as Lanzhou in Gansu by the next Chinese New Year. This \"tangzhuang craze\" (t s t\u00e1ngzhu\u0101ng r\u00e8) saw the tangzhuang and other traditional clothes become fashionable daily wear for both sexes, which gave a large boost to the domestic silk industry. The original designers left their original companies to start their own businesses to capitalize on their creation's popularity, but the fad was short-lived and most had moved on by 2004.\n\nSubsequent history\n\nEven after the end of its fad, the tangzhuang continues to have a place in Chinese fashion. It remained in common use among Jiang Zemin's clique and the nouveau riche, but more especially became a menswear staple on the mainland and abroad for traditional Chinese holidays alongside western and Mao-style suits.\n\nThe tangzhuang\u2014and its perceived inauthenticity as ethnic clothing\u2014is also credited by members of the hanfu movement with having inspired their cause and a revival of actual traditional Han clothing, despite the Chinese public's usual confusion about its origin. (Traditional Chinese fashions have been so long mixed with Manchu and western elements that Tang-style robes are confused with Japanese kimonos and Ming clothes with Korean hanboks.)\n\nChina used the \"Tang suit jackets\" again for its 2014 APEC summit, but with an updated style in maroon, green, and blue that The Guardian unflatteringly compared to Star Trek uniforms.\n\nStyle\n\nThe APEC jackets were intended to reflect \"both traditional Chinese flavor and modern ideals\". They have straight Mandarin collars, similar to those on the changshan and magua that gave the style its name. Unlike the traditional 2D \"flat-cutting\"  p\u00edngmi\u00e0n c\u00e1iji\u01cen) process used to create those garments, which tends to produce a baggy and ill-fitted look, tangzhuangs are made using the 3D \"solid-cutting\" (t s l\u00ect\u01d0 c\u00e1iji\u01cen) process developed in Europe. In particular, they employ draping, darts, and set-in sleeves cut separately from the rest of the main garment, which give them a more fitted look than traditional Chinese designs. The original version also employed shoulder pads to give a stronger silhouette.\n\nAlthough the APEC jackets were pointedly made using artificial fibers, silk tangzhuang have since outsold those made from cotton and other materials. Tangzhuang are available in a variety of colors, although the most common are red or blue. The brocade is often decorated with a repeated pattern of embroidery. Common designs involve the repetition of auspicious Chinese characters such as f\u00fa (, \"happiness\") or sh\u00f2u (t, s, \"longevity\") for good luck and good wishes. Tangzhuang are usually fastened with decorative knotwork instead of buttons.\n\nTangzhuang are usually considered menswear but they may also be worn by women, as by New Zealand's prime minister Helen Clark at APEC 2001.\n\nSee also \n Chinese clothing\n Hanfu, also meaning \"Han clothing\"\n Ru - Chinese upper garment\n Chinese button knot\n Color in Chinese culture\n\nReferences\n\nCitations\n\nSources \n\n .\n .\n .\n . \n .\n .\n .\n .\n . \n . \n .\n .\n .\n .\n .\n .\n .\n .\n . \n .\n .\n .\n .\n .\n .\n .\n .\n\nExternal links\n\nChinese clothing\nJackets\n21st-century fashion", "machine_text": "Tangzhuang is a traditional style of Chinese clothing that has been around for centuries. Tangzhuang, also known as Zhongshan suit, is named after Sun Yat-sen, who was also known as Sun Zhongshan, the founder of the Republic of China. This style of clothing is often worn for formal and semi-formal occasions such as weddings, business meetings, and ceremonies. Tangzhuang is made up of a jacket and pants. The jacket has a straight collar and usually has four pockets. The pants are wide-legged and loose-fitting. The jacket is often made of silk or cotton and can be embroidered with various designs. Tangzhuang has a long and rich history in Chinese culture. It is believed that Tangzhuang was popularized during the Qing Dynasty in the 19th century. It was worn by officials and scholars who wanted to distinguish themselves from the common people. Tangzhuang then became popular among the general public in the early 20th century. Tangzhuang has undergone many changes over the years. In the 1920s and 1930s, it was modified to fit the Western-style suit. In the 1950s and 1960s, it was further modified to fit the Mao suit, a style that was popularized during the Communist era. Today, Tangzhuang is once again gaining popularity in China and abroad. It is often worn as a symbol of Chinese culture and tradition. Many fashion designers are incorporating Tangzhuang elements into their designs and creating modern versions of this classic style. In conclusion, Tangzhuang is a timeless and versatile style of Chinese clothing that has been popular for centuries.

On 1 January 2016, it was merged into the new commune of Les Aveni\u00e8res-Veyrins-Thuellin.\n\nThe inhabitants of the commune are known as Aveni\u00e8rants or Aveni\u00e8rantes.\n\nGeography\nLes Aveni\u00e8res lies on the left bank of the Rh\u00f4ne as it loops north some 25\u00a0km east by north-east of Bourgoin-Jallieu and 25\u00a0km west by north-west of Chamb\u00e9ry. The Rhone river forms the north-eastern border of the commune and is also the border between Is\u00e8re and Ain departments. Access to the commune is by road D450 from Veyrins-Thuellin in the south-west which goes to the village then continues south-east to Saint-Genix-sur-Guiers. The D33 goes from Morestel in the north-west and passes through the north of the commune and across the Rh\u00f4ne bridge where it becomes the D10 and goes north-east to join the D19. The D40B goes north from the village to join the D33. The D40E connects the  D40 at the eastern edge of the commune to the D40B. Apart from the village there are the hamlets of Le Chamolay, Curtille, Le Grand Chaffard, Le Maitre, Le Bessey, Le Sablonnet, and Les Nappes. The commune has a large forest in the north-east on the \u00cele Molettes with a large urban area in the centre mixed with farmland, and in the south mixed forest and farmland.\n\nThe north-western border of the commune consists entirely of a left branch of the Rh\u00f4ne river as it loops north on its course through Lyon south to the Mediterranean. The Grand Canal de l'Huert forms the south-western border of the commune which curves to join the Huert river which is part of the northern border of the commune.

A scythe found in Les Aveni\u00e8res region is preserved in the Vienne Museum. It is the only evidence of human occupation before the Gallo-Romans. It was found at the confluence of the Bi\u00e8vre and the Rh\u00f4ne.\n\nRoman Era\nIn 1989 maintenance work undertaken in the La Cour du Pont district led to the discovery of two oak piles at a depth of 2 metres. A Carbon-14 study undertaken by the centre for chronology at the Claude Bernard University Lyon 1 (CNRS) gave a date between 39 BC and 120 AD.  It is possible that they were piles for a Gallo-Roman bridge used to cross the Rhone between Les Aveni\u00e8res and Thuellin.\n\nFrom the Middle Ages to modern times\nIn 1330 Aigline de Gerbais was married to Louis de Rivoire, knight, lord of Romagnieu, Domessin, la B\u00e2tie-Montgascon, Villeneuve de Ciers (les Aveni\u00e8res), and Bruzolo en Pi\u00e9mont.\nIn 1496 notes and coins prove that Humbert of Baternay was deprived of the proceeds of the sale and transfer of the lands of Dolomieu and Aveni\u00e8res by King Charles VIII.\nIn October 1496 Charles VIII issued Letters Patent ceding Dolomieu and Avenieres to Humbert of Bagternay.\nOn 22 January 1560 copies were made of letters agreed to by King Charles with Ren\u00e9 de Baternay on the subject of the lands of Ornacieux,  Dolomieu, and Les Aveni\u00e8res.\nOn 8 October 1609 Gabrielle de Baternay, widow of Gaspard de la Chastre, sold the lands and lordships of Aveni\u00e8res and Brangues as well as the Barony of Bouchage to M. of Granieu and Dorgeoise.\nIn July 1523 letters from Fran\u00e7ois I stated that the possession of the lands of Dolomieu and Aveni\u00e8res was held by Ren\u00e9 de Baternay. An order from the King's Council showed that Ren\u00e9 de Baternay would be restored to possession of the lands of Dolomieu and Aveni\u00e8res.\nOn 15 March 1642 there was a memoir and instructions on the subject of the proceedings of the King's Council regarding the lands of Dolomieu and Aveni\u00e8res.\n\n20th Century\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century the town was served two secondary railways: the Chemin de fer de l'Est de Lyon to Lyon and Aosta, and the Tramways d\u00e9partementaux de l'Is\u00e8re, which was taken over by Tramways de l'Ouest du Dauphin\u00e9, to La Tour-du-Pin.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Air-gap flash\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "An air-gap flash is a photographic light source capable of producing sub-microsecond light flashes, allowing for (ultra) high-speed photography. This is achieved by a high-voltage (20\u00a0kV typically) electric discharge between two electrodes over the surface of a quartz (or glass) tube. The distance between the electrodes is such that a spontaneous discharge does not occur. To start the discharge a high-voltage pulse (70\u00a0kV for example) is applied on an electrode inside the quartz tube.\n\nThe flash can be triggered electronically by being synchronised with an electronic detection device such as a microphone or an interrupted laser beam in order to illuminate a fast event. A sub-microsecond flash is fast enough to photographically capture a supersonic bullet in flight without noticeable motion blur.\n\nHistory\nThe person credited with popularising the flash is Harold Eugene Edgerton, though the  earlier scientist Ernst Mach also used a spark gap as a fast photographic lighting system.  William Henry Fox Talbot is said to have created the first spark-based flash photo, using a Leyden jar, the original form of the capacitor. Edgerton was one of the founders of EG&G company who sold an air-gap flash under the name Microflash 549. There are several commercial flashes available today.\n\nDesign parameters \n\nThe aim of a high-speed flash is to be very fast and yet bright enough for adequate exposure. An air-gap flash system typically consists of a capacitor that is discharged through a gas (air in this case). The speed of a flash is mainly determined by the time it takes to discharge the capacitor through the gas. This time is proportional to\n\n,\n\nin which L is the inductance and C the capacitance of the system. To be fast, both L and C must be kept small.\n\nThe brightness of the flash is proportional to the energy stored in the capacitor:\n\n,\n\nwhere V is the voltage across the capacitor. This shows that high brightness calls for a large capacitance and a high voltage. However, since a large capacitance would have a relatively long discharge time that would make the flash slow, the only practical solution is to use a very high voltage on a relatively small capacitor, with a very low inductance. Typical values are 0.05\u00a0\u00b5F capacitance, 0.02\u00a0\u00b5H inductance, 10\u00a0J energy, 0.5\u00a0\u00b5s duration and about 20\u00a0MW power.\n\nAir (mainly nitrogen) is preferred as a gas because it is fast. Xenon has a much higher efficiency in turning energy into light, but is limited in speed to about 10 microseconds, caused by its own afterglow.\n\nThe spark is guided over a quartz surface to improve the light output and benefit from the cooling capacity, making the flash faster. This has a negative effect in the form of quartz erosion because of high energy discharge.\n\nSpectral properties \n\nSince the spark gap discharges in air generating a plasma, the spectrum shows both a continuum and spectral lines, mainly of nitrogen since air is 79% nitrogen.\nThe spectrum is rich in UV but covers the entire visible range down to infra-red.\nWhen a quartz tube is used as ignition tube, it shows a clear phosphorescence in blue after the flash, induced by the UV.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nAmateur air-gap flash for ultra-high-speed photography by Niels Noordhoek\nMIT Edgerton center\nScientific American article on air-gap flash\n\n \nPhotographic lighting\nLight sources\nPhotography equipment", "machine_text": "Air-gap flash, also known as spark Gap Flash or compressed air flash, is a photographic flash technique that uses a high voltage electrical discharge between two electrodes to create a burst of light. The flash works by first charging a capacitor with a high voltage power supply, typically around 5-20kV. Once the capacitor is charged, a gas such as xenon or argon is released into the space between the electrodes, creating a spark that rapidly discharges the capacitor and generates a powerful burst of light. Air-gap flashes were developed in the early 20th century as a way to photograph fast-moving objects such as bullets or explosions. They were also used in scientific experiments to capture ultra-fast phenomena such as nuclear reactions or electrical discharges. Today, air-gap flashes are mostly used in specialized fields such as ballistics, biomechanics, and high-speed photography. One of the advantages of air-gap flashes is their ability to produce extremely short pulses of light, often lasting only a few microseconds. This allows for clear, high-speed photographs of objects in motion without motion blur. Air-gap flashes are also able to produce a high intensity of light that is evenly distributed around the object being photographed, making them useful in applications such as photographing explosions or welding. Despite their advantages, air-gap flashes have several limitations. One of the most significant is their size and portability; air-gap flashes require a large amount of space to house the high voltage power source and capacitor bank. They are also expensive and require specialized training to operate safely. In recent years, technological advancements in LED lighting and other forms of flash photography have decreased the use of air-gap flashes. However, they remain an important photographic technique for specialized fields where a high degree of precision is necessary.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 35938155}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Meade Conflict\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Meade Conflict refers to a dilemma where an economy faces conflict between its internal and external balances. The phenomenon was proposed by the British economist and Nobel Prize Laurent James Meade in his influential book The Theory of International Economic PolicyThe Balance of Payments (1951). Trevor Swan developed this problem into Swan diagram, which became more influential in the economic theory. The discovery has also led to other models such as Tinbergen's Rule.\n\nAnalysis \nAccording to Meade's analysis, a country can find itself in the following four circumstances:\n\nThe problems in cases (a) and (b) can be solved using economic policies. Case (a) requires a expansionary fiscal and monetary policies that will reduce the surplus and spur recovery from the recession, while case (b) is the circumstance vice versa.\n\nHowever, in case (c), if the government and central bank of the country tries to restore payment equilibrium by expansionary policies, these measures will worsen inflation. The other alternative of tight fiscal and monetary policies means reduced inflation, but also worsen the surplus in payments. In the similar dilemma of case (d), the deficit implies that tight monetary and fiscal policies should be used, which worsens the country's recession, while the expansionary policies that will end the recession would worsen the payments deficit. Cases (c) and (d) are known as the Meade Conflict.\n\nInfluences \nThe phenomenon draws wide attention in China as the country was going through such circumstances in 2007 and 2018. The term has become more popular in Chinese news and literature than in some English-speaking countries.\n\nReferences \n\nMacroeconomics", "machine_text": "The Meade Conflict was a major confrontation that occurred during the American Civil War. It was fought between the Union Army of the Potomac, led by Major General George G. Meade, and the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, commanded by General Robert E. Lee. The conflict took place from July 1 to July 3, 1863, in and around the town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. It was the bloodiest battle ever fought on American soil, with an estimated 50,000 casualties. The Meade Conflict was a critical turning point in the war. Prior to the battle, Lee's army had won a string of victories and was on the offensive. If they had won at Gettysburg, they could have marched on Washington, DC, and possibly forced an end to the war in favor of the Confederacy. However, Meade's forces held the high ground and were able to repel wave after wave of Confederate attacks. On the second day of the battle, Lee attempted a flanking maneuver that failed, costing him valuable troops and momentum. On the third day, Lee ordered a charge across open ground towards the Union center, now known as Pickett's Charge. The charge was met with devastating fire from Union artillery and muskets, resulting in thousands of Confederate casualties. Lee was forced to withdraw from the battlefield, effectively ending his invasion of the North. The victory at Gettysburg rallied Union morale and marked the turning point of the war. It is considered one of the most significant battles in American history. In conclusion, the Meade Conflict, also known as the Battle of Gettysburg, was a pivotal moment in American history. It demonstrated the strength and resilience of the Union Army and marked the beginning of the end for the Confederacy. The battle is remembered today for its valor, sacrifice, and meaning in shaping the United States as we know it today.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 59343896}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"A Fable for Critics\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "A Fable for Critics is a book-length satirical poem by American writer James Russell Lowell, first published anonymously in 1848. The poem made fun of well-known poets and critics of the time and brought notoriety to its author.\n\nOverview\nA Fable for Critics satirized many of the most important figures in American literature at the time, including Ralph Waldo Emerson and James Fenimore Cooper. Many of his harshest judgments were aimed at names that have not survived in posterity, including Nathaniel Parker Willis, Cornelius Mathews, Fitz-Greene Halleck, and John Neal. He gave ample praise to Charles Frederick Briggs and Lydia Maria Child, though he was friends with both and likely allowed his friendship to inflate his assessment of their talents. Of Edgar Allan Poe, he said he was \"three-fifths genius... and two-fifths sheer fudge\". Lowell included himself as well, referring to himself as having difficulty determining the difference \"'twixt singing and preaching\". Many of the poetic portraits were balanced with praise, as in Halleck's:\nHalleck's better, I doubt not, than all he has written;\nIn his verse a clear glimpse you will frequently find\nIf not of a great, of a fortunate mind\n\nLowell's most vicious treatment was aimed at Margaret Fuller, whom he referred to as Miranda. At first, he intended to exclude her entirely but thought doing so would be more insulting and was convinced to write \"a line or two\" by his wife Maria White Lowell. Ultimately, his characterization was the only which was wholly negative and not balanced with praise. He suggested that she stole old ideas and presented them as her own and that she was only genuine when being spiteful.\n\nPublication history\n\nA Fable for Critics, with the subtitle \"A Glance at a Few of Our Literary Progenies\", was published anonymously as a pamphlet early in 1848. Three thousand copies were sold in short order. Lowell had hoped there would be sufficient profit from his sales, which he intended to turn over to his financially struggling friend Briggs, though it was said the profit was only enough to purchase one small silver plate. The poem was reprinted several times with Lowell's name after its initial publication. One version included an introductory note explaining its author's intentions: \"This jeu d'esprit was extemporized, I may fairly say, so rapidly was it written, purely for my own amusement and with no thought of publication\" until convinced to do so by Briggs.\n\nCritical response\nUltimately, A Fable for Critics earned Lowell notoriety as a poet, once his name was revealed, though he did not significantly profit from its publication. Lowell's early biographer Horace Scudder said A Fable for Critics was quickly overshadowed by the publication of The Biglow Papers, another satire by Lowell featuring a folksy character named Hosea Biglow which was published almost immediately following A Fable for Critics. Charles Briggs predicted as much in a letter to Lowell in which he said, \"I am pretty confident that the 'Fable' will suit the market for which it is intended, unless it should be killed by Hosea, who will help to divert public attention from his own kind\".\n\nJohn Ruskin labeled the poem \"in animal spirit and power... almost beyond anything I know\". Oliver Wendell Holmes found it \"capital\u2014crammed full and rammed down hard\u2014with powder (lots of it)\u2014shot\u2014slugs\u2014very little wadding... all crowded into a rusty-looking sort of blunderbuss barrel, as it were\u2014capped with a percussion preface\u2014and cocked with a title page as apropos as a wink to a joke\". Henry Wadsworth Longfellow compared it to Lord Byron's \"English Bards\" as being \"full of wild wit and deviltry, and amazingly clever\". Freeman Hunt reviewed the poem for Merchants' Magazine in December 1848 and remarked on how true the character assessments were: \"Our friends Bryant, Halleck, Willis, Whittier, Poe, and last but not least, Harry Franco, (Briggs,) are, in our judgment, as genuine life pictures as were ever sketched with pen or pencil, in prose or verse. The severity, if any, is lost in the general fidelity of the delineations.\"\n\nLowell's friends objected to the intense criticism of Fuller, specifically William Wetmore Story and Thomas Wentworth Higginson. Edgar Allan Poe reviewed the work in the Southern Literary Messenger and called it \"'loose'\u2014ill-conceived and feebly executed, as well in detail as in general... we confess some surprise at his putting forth so unpolished a performance\". His final judgment was that the work was not successful: \"no failure was ever more complete or more pitiable\".\n\nIn 1922, Amy Lowell, a later relative of the Lowell family, wrote a similar book which she titled A Critical Fable after she was lampooned by Robert Frost. In it, she pokes fun at contemporary poets like Frost, Ezra Pound, and T. S. Eliot using the byline \"A Poker of Fun\". In the younger Lowell's version, the satire presents two people in conversation, including Lowell himself and a present-day critic. The critic particularly defends women poets against the elder Lowell's disdain for them and instead saves their harshest criticism for male writers.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\nDuberman, Martin.

The poem was first published in 1848 and is considered to be one of Lowell's most famous works. The poem takes the form of a conversation between several notable literary figures of the time, including Ralph Waldo Emerson, John Greenleaf Whittier, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and Edgar Allan Poe. Lowell uses this framework to offer his critiques and opinions on the literary scene of the mid-19th century. The poem is notable for its use of humor and sarcasm, as well as its unapologetic criticism of Lowell's contemporaries. He praises Emerson's originality and thoughtfulness, while criticizing Longfellow for being too sentimental and Whittier for being too preachy. Poe, who was often the target of Lowell's criticism, is portrayed as a brilliant but flawed figure. Despite its criticism of specific individuals, \"A Fable for Critics\" is also a commentary on the state of American literature in the mid-19th century. Lowell was part of the Transcendentalist movement, which emphasized individualism and spirituality. The poem reflects the movement's desire for American writers to break away from European literary traditions and establish their own unique style. The poem was well-received by Lowell's contemporaries, many of whom appreciated his humor and willingness to critique his peers. It remains an influential work in American literature, and is often studied for its insights into mid-19th century literary culture.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 18850823}

The 1892 Spiders featured several stars, including future Hall of Fame members Cy Young, George Davis and Jesse Burkett. The team went to the league championship series, where they lost to the Boston Beaneaters.

He led the league in doubles and extra base hits in 1890. In May 1900, Childs was attempting a double play against the Pittsburgh Pirates when the Pirates player-manager Fred Clarke slid into him. There was a brief confrontation on the field, and then Childs spotted Clarke at a train station after the game. Childs charged Clarke and badly beat the manager in the ensuing fistfight. The next day, fans in Pittsburgh showed up in large numbers (triple the average Monday attendance) hoping to see a continuation of the scuffle, but the game was played without incident.\n\nChilds' playing time fell off in his final season of 1901 (63 games, from 137 the previous year) as Pete Childs (no known relationship) played more of the team's games at second base. A career .306 hitter, Childs retired with a .416 on-base percentage, 991 walks and 269 stolen bases, having played more than 1400 games as a second baseman.\n\nLater life\nBy the time he was 45, Childs was living in Baltimore, Maryland, and he had developed cirrhosis and nephritis (known as Bright's disease at the time).

On the basepaths, Childs was a skilled base-stealer, and he led the National League in stolen bases in 1890 and 1891. In addition to his defense and baserunning, Childs was also a solid offensive player. He had a career batting average of .306 and scored 100 or more runs in eight consecutive seasons. Childs was a switch-hitter and had good pop in his bat, hitting double-digit home runs three times in his career.

He was one of the most respected and sought-after bass players of his time and was particularly known for his skill in playing walking bass lines. Six's career in music began in the mid-1950s, where he frequently worked with well-known jazz musicians such as Art Pepper, Jimmy Giuffre, and Stan Kenton. He was also recognized for his work with legendary jazz pianist Bill Evans, who he performed with regularly in the 1960s and 70s. Six's musical style was characterized by his creative use of harmonics, and his ability to create rich, layered bass lines that complemented the melody and overall sound of the music. His contributions to the jazz genre were significant, as his playing was instrumental in shaping the sound of modern jazz. Throughout his career, Six worked on numerous recording projects with a variety of musicians, including saxophonist Cannonball Adderley, vibraphonist Milt Jackson, and drummer Shelly Manne. His contributions to jazz music were recognized by his peers as well as the wider jazz community, earning him widespread respect and admiration. Unfortunately, Six's life was cut short when he passed away on December 5, 1982, after a long battle with lung cancer. However, his legacy continues to live on through his recordings and the lasting impact he had on the development of jazz music. In conclusion, Jack Six was a highly respected and talented jazz bassist whose contributions to the genre were significant and memorable. His legacy remains an important part of the history of jazz music and serves as an inspiration to musicians today.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 54047583}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Ra-Ra Zoo\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Ra-Ra Zoo was an English-based new circus theatre company, active (August 1984 - September 1994), a seminal group who created self devised physical theatre performance for theatres using comedy and circus skills. Founded by Sue Broadway, Stephen Kent, David Spathaky and Sue Bradley while they were all working and staying together at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in August 1984.\n\nIn 2018, the UK Guardian newspaper named them as one of the 25 most influential aspects of the 250 year history of circus in the West.\n\nThe first public performance was at the infamous Tunnel Club hosted by Malcolm Hardee in the East End of London. Notably, the normally vocal audience were unusually silenced by a wordless version of their signature teacup act.\n\nTheir first full show at the Battersea Arts Centre was as part of the London International Mime Festival in January 1985, their first theatre show, sub-titled, \"Juggling With A Social Conscience\".\n\nThey subsequently toured internationally for ten years playing in theatres notable to Africa, South America, Australia and extensively in Europe. Their show under the joint Artistic Direction of David Spathaky and Sue Broadway combined the ethos of 'alternative' comedy of the 1980 with a 1970s revival of circus skills, variously called 'Neo-circus or new variety by them or New Circus' by other people, it largely promoted a reinvention of circus focusing on human skill and generally without presenting animal acts. Their background in street performing, The Amazing Mendezies and in the influential Circus Oz (of which Sue Broadway was a founding member) gave the show an irreverent, fast-paced, surrealist feel.\n\nProductions \n\nThey produced several different shows and were occasionally given some financial support in the UK by the Arts Council and other grants. They also produced several large scale community shows, were touring two shows at the same time in the early 1990s and created jobs for more than twenty five people simultaneously during production periods.\n\nThey notably adhered to a political commitment of a balance of men and women on stage and off and of equal pay for all company members throughout their existence.\n\nShows included:\n\nJuggling With A Social Conscience.\nMy Life on a Plate of Toast \u2014 Several versions - chamber circus 4 people on stage\nDomestic Bliss - a touring seven person theatre circus show\nStop Laughing This Is Serious - touring 7 person theatre circus show\nFabulous Beasts - touring seven person theatre circus show\nGravity Swing- touring seven person theatre circus show\nAngels and Amazons - all woman 3 person clown show\nSwan - a community circus\nWhite Snake - A large scale community circus opera (50 performers) combining professional and non professional performers, trainers from China, original libretto and commissioned music.\nCabinet of Curiosities - A 'chamber circus' - 4 people on stage\nBroadway Belles - All women cabaret show\nThe Mast - a site specific outdoor aerial rig at the Albany Empire in Deptford and the Henley Regatta.\nThe Plymouth Theatre Royal Cleaners - a commissioned intervention at a patrons end of season party.\n\nInfluence \nRa-Ra Zoo was influenced by the agitprop and political theatre of the late 1960s and early 70's and the ritual theatre and 'Happenings' associated with the time notably the 'Grand Magic Circus', 'Circus Oz, 'The People Show', 'Cunning Stunts, 'The Festival of Fools' in Amsterdam and the German choreographer Pina Bausch. Political influence came from the 1970s wave of the feminist movement and direct action politics such as the protests at Greenham Common in the UK and the resurgence of 'theatre' as political activism.\n\nRa-Ra Zoo influenced in turn many others as the company employed over a hundred people during its existence and played to many thousands of people worldwide. They spawned and encouraged, directly and indirectly, many offshoots including The Circus Space, (now NCCA) The Gandini Juggling Project, The Flying Gorillas, No Ordinary Angels, Le La Les, Broadway and Co., and Stretch People.\n\nFounder Sue Broadway  returned to lead Circus Oz  as Artistic Director and helped direct the circus elements of the Sydney Olympics opening ceremony.\n\nFounder Dave Spathaky was in semi retirement from 1994 but after surgery in 2008 is producing and occasionally performing as The Great Davido.\nFounder Stephen Kent is a renowned musician and alongside his performing hosts a weekly radio show of world music.\n\nMark Digby and Ali Houiellebecq who met while in RRZ and formed 'La le les' which toured successfully for many years.\n\nLongtime member Lindsey Butcher, dancer, juggler and aerialist subsequently formed Gravity & Levity.\n\nSean Gandini and Kati Yl\u00e4-Hokkala left Ra-Ra Zoo in 1992 to form the Gandini Juggling\n\nMedia Visibility\nAlthough generally politically opposed to recorded media, the company performed on television on programs for young people such as 'No. 73', Blue Peter, guest spots on 'The Late Late Show' and elsewhere. They also featured on a broadcast pilot for C4 with Spike Milligan 'The Last Laugh before TVAM'. Dave Spathaky and Sue Broadway appeared together on TV shows worldwide, several times successfully beating their own world plate-spinning record.\n\nEarly Days\nIn early days they played on the emerging 'New Variety' and alternative cabaret circuit and were the very first performers on stage at the newly reopened Hackney Empire in East London on 9 December 1986. They subsequently played several successful seasons there with their full-length shows.\n\nWorld Touring\nTheir extensive touring was sometimes partly funded by the British Council but also self-produced. They represented the UK at World Expos in Vancouver, Canada, in 1986 and in Brisbane, Australia, in 1988.\n\nDeath or Resurrection?\n\nRa-Ra Zoo's last full show to date 'Cabinet of Curiosities' toured in 1993/4 and like their first full show (in 1995) was in the London International Mime Festival (in 1994), the last show of that tour was at the Liverpool Everyman also in 1994.\n\nReprise\nIn 2011 founders Dave Spathaky, Sue Broadway (with musician Thom Podgoretsky) performed at The Cork Midsummer Festival and the Glastonbury Festival but have currently no plans for new Ra-Ra Zoo productions in the pipelines but an online project in 2020  called 'Clown Power Live' at: http://zoological.ie, during the anthropause, contain collaborative elements between Sue Broadway & Dave Spathaky.\n\nReferences\n\nTheatre companies in England\nEdinburgh Festival performers", "machine_text": "Ra-Ra Zoo is an animal-themed attraction located in the heart of the city of Abidjan, Ivory Coast.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"A Hole in the Sock of (Dave Davies)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "A Hole in the Sock of Dave Davies refers to an unreleased album of solo material by Dave Davies, lead guitarist and co-founder of British rock band the Kinks. Apparently the album was, at least for a time, intended to be released under the name Lincoln County, however, numerous names have been applied to it, including The Album That Never Was.\n\nBackground\nIn July 1967, Dave Davies readied his first solo single, credited entirely under his name (although co-written by his brother and fellow Kinks member Ray Davies), entitled \"Death of a Clown\". In the past, as a member of the Kinks, Dave Davies had only released his own compositions on B-sides and as part of larger LPs. The Kinks' record label sensed potential sales in a solo release from the overlooked Davies, and issued \"Death of a Clown\" as his debut. Although credited to Davies, it was technically a Kinks recording, as his backing band was, in fact, the Kinks.\n\nUpon release, \"Death of a Clown\" unexpectedly rose to number three on the UK Singles Chart. Wanting to profit off the new buzz that was suddenly surrounding Davies, a solo LP was scheduled for release some time in 1968 or 1969.\n\nA follow-up single, \"Susannah's Still Alive\", was released in November 1967. However, it only reached number 20 on Melody Maker. The release of the solo album was held back, and it was decided to wait and see how another single would fare. As anticipation grew for the release of the new LP, fans nicknamed it A Hole in the Sock Of. The name was based on a remark Ray Davies had made to a reporter during an interview about the title of Dave's forthcoming solo album and was, although meant ironically, taken seriously. The title was a send up possibly of the Beatles ambitious \"A Day in the Life\" or Traffic's \"Hole In My Shoe\".\n\n\"Lincoln County\" was chosen as the next single but failed to chart. With subsequent singles meeting the same result, a combination of Davies' own lack of interest in continuing and Pye's decision to stop killed off any hopes of an album.\n\nIn a 1999 interview, Davies stated that:\n\nI was quite surprised when management and the record company wanted me to make an album. I thought it was quite daunting. There were a couple of tunes I liked - 'Suzannah's Still Alive,' 'Lincoln County' - but it had to feel right, and it didn't feel right. I did a few songs in a demo studio and I knocked out three or four songs, and one of them was 'Creeping Jean,' and I started to get very depressed about the whole idea. One of the last songs I recorded then was 'I'm Crying,' so you can tell what frame of mind I was in.\n\nRecording and tracks\nTechnically work began on the project after the unexpected success of \"Death of a Clown\". Initially, proposed material included blues numbers by Lead Belly and Big Bill Broonzy in addition to original material; ultimately, lack of both original material and interest delayed further work on an LP until the very end of 1968, when four new songs were recorded at Polydor Studios in London. Work was to have completed early in 1969 but was delayed at least partly when Dave Davies fractured a finger. Much of the unissued material seems to have been recorded in June 1969, just after completion of recordings for Arthur (with John Dalton, not Pete Quaife, on bass). Two titles (\"This Man He Weeps Tonight\" and \"Mindless Child of Motherhood\"), both released as B-sides of Kinks singles were recorded as part of the Arthur sessions, but ultimately not included on that LP's final track selection. \n\nReprise files imply that Reprise received tapes of this album, under the title Lincoln County, in July 1969 while it was still considered for release by the band. By September of that year, the decision was made not to release the album. Throughout 1970, reports of a reworked version with new material were discussed; the possibility of issuing Dave's LP as the second half of a 2-LP set was raised, but by the close of that year all talk of the LP's release had ceased. Oddly, tapes of this LP were not officially logged into Reprise's official master tape log until 1972, as part of their contractual settlement after the Kinks moved to RCA. Short of the existence of this acetate in their vaults, there is no other indication that Reprise ever seriously considered this LP for release in its entirety. All songs were mixed (in the case of \"Susannah's Still Alive\", remixed) in stereo for this release. The track listing given here is per Doug Hinman.\n\n\"Susannah's Still Alive\" (released as a single in 1967, remixed stereo version released on Kink Kronikles)\n\"There Is No Life Without Love\" (released as a b-side of \"Lincoln Country\", mono version released on The Album That Never Was and bonus tracks for Something Else', mono version released on the 2011 Deluxe Mono version of \"Arthur\"\n\"This Man He Weeps Tonight\" (released as a b-side of \"Shangri-La\", mono version released on the 2011 Deluxe Mono version of \"Arthur\"\n\"Mindless Child of Motherhood\" (released as a b-side of \"Drivin'\", both mono and stereo version released on Arthur CD re-release)\n\"Hold My Hand\" (released as a single in 1969, mono version released on The Album That Never Was; stereo version released on 2011 Arthur deluxe edition)\n\"Do You Wish To Be a Man?\" (stereo version released on Hidden Treasures)\n\"Are You Ready?\" (stereo version released on Hidden Treasures)\n\"Creeping Jean\" (released as a b-side of \"Hold My Hand\", stereo version released on the 2004 Deluxe Edition of Village Green Preservation Society, mono version released on 2011 Arthur deluxe edition)\n\"I'm Crying\" (stereo version released on Hidden Treasures)\n\"Lincoln County\" (released as a single in 1968, mono version released on The Album That Never Was and bonus tracks for Something Else CD re-release) (longer stereo version released on 2011 Arthur deluxe edition)\n\"Mr. Shoemaker's Daughter\" (stereo version released on Arthur CD re-release)\n\"Mr. Reporter\" (stereo version released on Face to Face and remixed stereo version released on 2011 Arthur deluxe edition)\n\"Groovy Movies\" (stereo version released on the 2004 Deluxe Edition of Village Green Preservation Society)\n\nThe Album That Never Was\nAlthough the unreleased album is sometimes called The Album That Never Was, several other unreleased Kinks projects were called this over time.

Dave Davies, the lead guitarist of the band, was said to have a hole in his sock, which led to a memorable and improvised exchange during their performance of \"You Really Got Me\". According to reports, Davies' sock had come undone during the performance, leaving a hole visible to audiences. Lead singer Ray Davies noticed this and called attention to it, leading to a playful banter between the two brothers. Dave Davies reportedly responded, \"It's a new pair of socks, Ray. They must have been in a fight!\" The incident became famous among Kinks fans and has even been referenced in subsequent performances by the band. It is seen as a testament to the band's improvisational skills and their ability to interact with each other and their audience. The Kinks were a British rock band that formed in 1964 and became one of the most influential bands of the 1960s British Invasion. Their sound was characterized by their use of power chords and Ray Davies' distinctive storytelling lyrics. Despite their success, the band experienced numerous personal conflicts and lineup changes over the years. Dave Davies' relationship with his brother and lead singer had been tumultuous, with both brothers sometimes engaging in physical altercations.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Duke Nukem (character)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Duke Nukem is a fictional character and protagonist of the Duke Nukem series of video games. The character first appeared in the 1991 video game Duke Nukem, developed by Apogee Software. He has since starred in multiple sequels developed by 3D Realms. Most recently, he starred in Duke Nukem Forever, released by Gearbox Software, which now owns the rights and intellectual property.\n\nThe character was created by Todd Replogle, George Broussard, and Scott Miller of Apogee Software. Duke Nukem was redesigned as the present tough guy incarnation by George Broussard and Allen Blum for the 1996 game Duke Nukem 3D. A sequel to Duke Nukem 3D, Duke Nukem Forever, was released in 2011, after remaining in development since 1997.\n\nPersonality and appearance\nIn the original game, Duke Nukem barely spoke and was portrayed as a disgruntled TV viewer hired by the CIA to save Earth from the mad scientist Dr. Proton, whom he took offense to for interrupting his soap opera. In the second game, he began to evolve into a more traditional action hero, but remained mostly silent. Since the third game, Duke's personality has been that of a confident, aggressive, politically incorrect, wise-cracking, hyper-masculine person. Although not superhuman, Duke manages to achieve incredible physical feats of violence and conquest through sheer machismo and expertise with automatic firearms. In Duke Nukem Forever, his massive ego is somehow capable of functioning like a shield from physical damage.\n\nHis missions generally involve killing aliens that have invaded Earth. He is apparently sexually adept and irresistible to females, and circumstances often find him surrounded by many buxom women. However, he frequently mentions an estranged love interest named \"Lani\", and she becomes the basis for many of his jokes. This is widely believed to be a reference to Lani Minella, a voice actress who did several voices for Duke Nukem 3D.\n\nDuke Nukem's current character is a pastiche of a number of Hollywood action heroes, including Dirty Harry, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and John Wayne. Many of his lines are taken from the movie Army of Darkness, and his most famous line is from the movie They Live with Roddy Piper saying, \"I have come here to chew bubble gum and kick ass. And I'm all out of bubble gum.\" Duke's appearance resembles that of The Boz as well as characters played by Arnold Schwarzenegger, Dolph Lundgren and Jean-Claude Van Damme. Voiced by Jon St. John since the third game, Duke's voice is based on that of Clint Eastwood as Dirty Harry.\n\nDuke is best known for his trademark jet pack, his golden IMI Desert Eagle pistol or golden Colt M1911, and Ray-Ban Wayfarer sunglasses, which completely conceal his eyes and which he has been seen wearing even at night since Duke Nukem 3D. His other trademark is a blond military-style flattop haircut which has existed since the first game, and the radioactive trefoil symbol, which is found on his belt-buckle, the side of his signature pistol, and numerous other locations throughout the games.  He usually wears a red tank top (pink in the first game), military tactical harness, blue jeans and black army boots - in some of the games, Duke executes a maneuver known as the \"Mighty Boot,\" which is simply a strong front kick. He is also notable for constantly smoking a cigar.\n\nIn Duke Nukem II, Duke wrote an autobiography titled Why I'm So Great which he later autographed in Duke Nukem Forever. In Duke Nukem Forever, he's achieved immense fame and fortune since saving the Earth, now owning a casino on the Las Vegas Strip called The Ladykiller, in which the Damn! ... It's Late Show (hosted by Johnny O'Lenoman) is taped, and the Museum of Duke is housed, as well as a burger restaurant chain called Duke Burger. He is also linked to the EDF (Earth Defense Forces), answering to General Graves. In a news conference held at the end of Duke Nukem Forever, he announces his intention of running for president, which would make him the 69th U.S. president.\n\nAccording to the stats provided by the Duke Nukem Character Memory Card, he is 6'4\" (1,93 m) and at a body fat percentage of 8%, weighs 240\u00a0lbs. (109\u00a0kg).\n\nAppearances\nDuke Nukem was initially created in 1987 by chief programmer Todd Replogle of Apogee Software (now 3D Realms) as the protagonist for the video game he was designing titled Metal Future, which was set in the then-near future of \"one decade later from now\" in 1997. After hearing the character's name, producer and founder of Apogee, Scott Miller, suggested the game should have the same name, and he helped design the character. Artwork was produced by George Broussard, Allen H. Blum III, and Jim Norwood. Duke was not voiced, but spoke through on-screen text.\n\nIn the sequel, Duke Nukem II, which was released two years later, the same mostly-silent incarnation of the character was used, although he was now an American hero. Duke Nukem II features an intro with one line, spoken by Joe Siegler (\"I'm back\"), and a death scream by character co-creator Todd Replogle.\n\nFor Duke Nukem 3D, the character of Duke Nukem was dramatically redesigned by George Broussard and Allen Blum as the more familiar macho, wise-cracking character of today. Duke Nukem 3D was one of the most controversial games at the time due to its strong violence, cultural stereotypes, strong language, and sexual content. Duke Nukem 3D, as well as the dozen or so subsequent Duke Nukem games, feature Jon St. John as the voice of Duke Nukem. Duke Nukem 3D was the first game in which the character has a significant speaking role.\n\nIn March 2018, it was announced that John Cena will star in a Duke Nukem movie for Paramount Pictures & Platinum Dunes. However, in January 2019, Duke Nukem voice actor Jon St. John stated that no movie was in development. In a press statement announcing Embracer Group's acquisition of Gearbox Software, however, production of the film was reconfirmed.\n\nGames with Duke Nukem as a protagonist\n Duke Nukem (temporarily \"Duke Nukum\") \u2013 1991 \u2013 MS-DOS\n Duke Nukem II \u2013 1993 \u2013 MS-DOS, iPhone/iPod Touch, iPad\n Duke Nukem 3D \u2013 1996 \u2013 MS-DOS, Mac OS, Sega Saturn, Mega Drive, Game.com, Xbox Live Arcade, iPhone/iPod Touch, Nokia N900, Source ports, Android, iPad\n Duke Nukem 64 \u2013 1997 \u2013 Nintendo 64\n Duke Nukem: Total Meltdown \u2013 1997 \u2013 PlayStation\n Duke Nukem: Time to Kill \u2013 1998 \u2013 PlayStation\n Duke Nukem: Zero Hour \u2013 1998 \u2013 Nintendo 64\n Duke Nukem \u2013 1999 \u2013 Game Boy Color\n Duke Nukem: Land of the Babes (temporarily \"Planet of the Babes\") \u2013 2000 \u2013 PlayStation\n Duke Nukem: Manhattan Project \u2013 2002 \u2013 Microsoft Windows, Xbox Live Arcade\n Duke Nukem Advance \u2013 2002 \u2013 Game Boy Advance\n Duke Nukem Mobile \u2013 2004 \u2013 Tapwave Zodiac\n Duke Nukem Mobile - 2004 - Cellular phones\n Duke Nukem Mobile II: Bikini Project \u2013 2005 \u2013 Cellular phones\n Duke Nukem Mobile 3D \u2013 2005 \u2013 Cellular phones (updated port of the original Zodiac version with enhanced graphics)\n Duke Nukem Arena - 2007 - Cellular phones (updated port of Duke Nukem Mobile 3D that included an arena-style multiplayer)\n Duke Nukem: Critical Mass \u2013 2011 - Nintendo DS\n Duke Nukem Forever \u2013 2011 \u2013 Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3\n Duke Nukem 3D: World Tour \u2013 2016 \u2013 Microsoft Windows, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch\n\nOther appearances\n Cosmo's Cosmic Adventure - 1992 - MS-DOS\n Death Rally - 1996 - MS-DOS\n Balls of Steel - 1997 - Microsoft Windows\n Blood - 1997 - MS-DOS\n Serious Sam 2 - 2005 - Microsoft Windows, Linux, Xbox\n Death Rally - 2011 - Microsoft Windows, iOS\n Choplifter HD - 2012 - Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360\n Bulletstorm: Full Clip Edition - 2017 - Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One\n Rad Rodgers: Radical Edition - 2018 - Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch\n Wild Buster: Heroes of Titan - 2018 - Microsoft Windows\n Ready Player One - 2018 - Film\n Duke Nukem - TBA - Film\n\nReception\nDuke Nukem has been listed on many \"Best Characters\" and \"Best Heroes\" lists over the years, including being listed as number one in ScrewAttack's \"Top 10 Coolest Video Game Characters\" list in 2007. Featuring him in the section \"top ten forces of good\" in their 2004 list of top 50 retro game heroes, Retro Gamer called Duke \"the ultimate cheese hero, and a true remnant of 80\u2019s action flicks.\" He was listed at number 27 in the \"Top 50 Video Game Characters\" list by Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition 2011. GameDaily also ranked him sixth on their list of best anti-heroes in video games. In 2011, Empire ranked him as the 20th greatest video game character, calling him \"one of the best action characters ever devised\" and adding that \"Film might have Schwarzenegger, but Gaming's got Mr Nukem\".\n\nReception of the character by the time of Duke Nukem Forever's release was mostly mixed. Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer elaborated on Duke Nukem's decreased relevance since 1996, and added that the character's \"half-hearted digs\" at rival franchises were ill-advised due to the game's datedness. Charles Onyett of IGN likened Duke Nukem's maturity to a \"12-year-old boy with Internet access\" and expressed disappointment in the character's datedness and the missed opportunity on the developers' part to \"[play] with the idea of Duke as an anachronism\". Ryan Winterhalter of 1UP.com noted that Duke Nukem had become \"a caricature of his former self. He's crossed the line from charmingly foul-mouthed to obnoxious and embarrassing.\" Cian Hassett of PALGN was more positive about the character, finding him to be \"genuinely hilarious\" due to his tongue-in-cheek rejection of video game traditions (such as finding a key to open a door or wearing a special suit of armor).\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nAction-adventure game characters\nDuke Nukem\nFictional alcohol abusers\nFictional American people in video games\nFictional cannabis users\nFictional characters from California\nFictional gamblers\nFictional super soldiers\nFictional mercenaries in video games\nFictional smokers\nFirst-person shooter characters\nMale characters in video games\nVideo game characters introduced in 1991\nVideo game characters with accelerated healing\nVideo game mascots\nVideo game protagonists", "machine_text": "Duke Nukem is a fictional character featured in a popular video game series of the same name.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"The Other Campaign\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Other Campaign () is a political program by the Zapatista Army of National Liberation for the recognition and protection of indigenous rights and autonomy in Mexico.  This program began in January 2006, and sent Subcomandante Marcos, the main spokesperson for the campaign, to travel across Mexico for several months. This tour was intended to create connections among the Zapatistas and pre-existing resistance groups throughout Mexico.\n\nThroughout the campaign, the Zapatistas met with a diverse number of groups and organizations, such as trade union organizers, indigenous leaders, intellectuals, feminists and women's rights activists, LGBT people, advocates for human rights, students, environmental activists, fishermen, factory workers, natural disaster victims, peasants, teachers, prostitutes, and young people. Marcos said that the goal of the campaign is \"not to speak or run for office, but 'to listen to the simple and humble people who struggle'.\"  This united force was conceived to fight against neoliberalism and capitalism. The Zapatistas hoped to eliminate these practices in the Mexican federal government in order to protect the livelihoods of those citizens who are exploited economically by these institutions. Based on the Sixth Declaration of the Lacandon Jungle, the Other Campaign's ultimate goal was to force the Mexican government to agree to a convention which would rewrite the national constitution to include protection of indigenous rights and autonomy and exclude elements of neoliberal capitalism.\n\nHistorical context \nThe Other Campaign emerged from a 12-year-long struggle for indigenous rights, known as the Zapatista Movement or Zapatismo. This movement began on January 1, 1994 with an uprising in Chiapas, Mexico to protest the North American Free Trade Agreement and fight for the recognition and protection of rights for the indigenous people of Mexico. The movement fought opposition from the Mexican government to end such problems as financial exploitation of natives and for the recognition of racial, ethnic, and gender differences among Mexican citizens. Throughout their existence as a political force, the Zapatistas have published a series of declarations to announce the movement's objectives, in accordance with traditional peasant and indigenous revolts in 19th-century Mexico. In 1996, the Zapatistas organized a series of peace talks with the Mexican federal government, focusing initially on culture and indigenous civil rights. These negotiations led to the signing of the San Andr\u00e9s Agreements, also known as the San Andr\u00e9s Accords, on February 16, 1996. But in August 2001, the Mexican government defied the terms of the San Andr\u00e9s Agreements when the Mexican Congress enacted constitutional reforms that had a detrimental effect on indigenous rights.\n\nIn response to this defiance, in June, 2005 the Zapatistas released the Sixth Declaration of the Lacandon Jungle (also known as La Sexta in Spanish), the most recent of the movement's declarations of objectives. The declaration outlined several goals, and announced that the Zapatistas intend to remain both a political and military force in Mexico. The declaration describes the need for a new political party, independent from the parties of the Mexican Left and all other preexisting political parties. The Sixth Declaration also encourages an international fight against neoliberalism.\n\nTo accomplish the Sixth Declaration's goal of forming a new political force, the Zapatistas invited hundreds of organizations, political activists, leaders, and average citizens to meet and discuss strategies for gaining the support of resistance groups around the country. The result of the debates and organizational progress made during these meetings was the initiative known as the Other Campaign.\n\nCampaign\nThe Other Campaign began as an idea devised by the Zapatistas to travel throughout Mexico to meet other resistance groups and learn about the struggles they face in their communities and rally support against the neoliberal and capitalistic federal political system. Although this process resembles a conventional election campaign, the goal was not to elect a candidate to public office, but to create a new kind of political force that presents a different way to conduct political business during election campaigns.\n\nThe first meeting to discuss the organization, structure, and politics of the Other Campaign was held on September 16\u201318, 2005. Over 2,000 people participated in this two-day event. Their experience with activism ranged from none, to post-1994 Zapatismo activist experience, to activism in the 1970s. The participants had very diverse backgrounds, including union organizers, indigenous leaders, intellectuals, feminists and women's rights activists, gays, lesbians, advocates for human rights, students, environmental activists, and teachers. Urban youth collectives and nongovernmental organizations were also represented at this event. Despite this obvious diversity and the Zapatistas' 12-year long struggle for indigenous rights, the speakers at the conference rarely mentioned the necessity of equal involvement in the campaign in terms of gender, racial-ethnic group, and sexual orientation. Rather than incorporating these important issues into discussions of all aspects of the Other Campaign, they were confined to one section of the agenda, \"A Special Place for Differences\", drawing criticism from gay, lesbian, indigenous, and feminist organizations attending the event. Despite this internal criticism, the event continued its efforts to organize the campaign.\n\nIn January, 2006, the Other Campaign launched with Subcomandante Marcos, also known as Delegado Cero, traveling for several months around all 31 Mexican states. Marcos gave speeches which were attended by people as diverse as the collaborators from the campaign's first meeting, including fishermen, factory workers, natural disaster victims, peasants, teachers, gays, lesbians, prostitutes, and young people. The ultimate goal of this tour was to rally support from organizations throughout the nation in order to eradicate neoliberalism and capitalism from the political system in Mexico. The ideal achievement of this goal included pressuring the Mexican government to create a convention to rewrite the nation's constitution to protect all Mexicans from the exploitation that results from current capitalist and neoliberal practices.\n\nIn May 2014, Rafael Guill\u00e9n Vicente, the individual behind the persona and nom de guerre \"Subcomandante Marcos\", announced that he was retiring that persona and stepping down from his leadership role. He stated: \"We are warriors and as such we know our role and our time. Marcos, the character is no longer necessary... His character was created and now his creators, the Zapatistas, are destroying him.\" He signed this statement off with \"My name is Galeano. Rebel Subcomandante Galeano\", signalling the adoption of a new persona.\n\nNotes\n\nExternal links \n The Other Campaign EZLN (Official site in spanish)\n  The Other Journalism With The Other Campaign\n The Other Campaign: A Visual Record of the Zapatistas and Mexico 2006\n At a 60's Style Be-In, Guns Yield to Words, Lots of Words by The New York Times, August 31, 2005\n\nZapatista Army of National Liberation\n2006 in Mexico\n2006 in Mexican politics", "machine_text": "The Other Campaign is a political strategy that was initiated by the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN), a revolutionary leftist group in Mexico. The campaign was launched in 2006 as a response to the general elections in Mexico and sought to create a new, grassroots political movement that would challenge the existing political establishment. The Other Campaign was predicated on the idea that the traditional political parties in Mexico, which had dominated the political landscape for decades, were corrupt and unresponsive to the needs of the people. The EZLN argued that the country needed a new political paradigm, one that was based on the principles of democracy, social justice, and equality. The campaign was organized around a series of events, including meetings with other political and social movements, cultural events, rallies, and marches. The goal was to create a broad-based coalition of individuals and groups who were committed to building a new political movement that was independent of the established political parties. The Other Campaign was also marked by a focus on indigenous rights and autonomy. The EZLN argued that Mexico's indigenous populations were among the most marginalized and disadvantaged groups in the country, and that any meaningful political movement must take their needs into account. While the Other Campaign did not result in a significant shift in Mexico's political landscape, it did have an important impact on the country's political discourse. It helped to draw attention to the concerns of marginalized groups and inspired many activists and social movements to take up the struggle for social justice and political reform. In conclusion, The Other Campaign was a significant moment in Mexican political history, as it challenged the existing political establishment and created a new, grassroots political movement based on the principles of democracy, social justice, and equality. While it did not achieve all of its goals, it helped to inspire change and foster a sense of political engagement and activism among many Mexicans.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 4103816}

Named after General Gustave Marie Maurice Gordolon, the fortification was intended to provide heavy artillery support for infantry positions further forward. Constructed between 1932 and 1935, Ouvrage Gordolon was one of the largest and most heavily armed fortifications in the Maginot Line. It featured a series of deep underground tunnels, machine-gun nests, artillery emplacements, and lookout posts, as well as living quarters for hundreds of soldiers. The fortification was armed with a range of weapons, including 81mm and 135mm mortars, 75mm and 105mm guns, and 8mm and 13mm machine guns. During the Second World War, Ouvrage Gordolon saw heavy action as part of the larger Battle of France. Following the German invasion of France in May 1940, the fortification was subjected to intense bombardment by German artillery. Despite its heavy armament, Ouvrage Gordolon was eventually overrun by German troops on June 19, 1940, after a lengthy siege. The fortification was subsequently occupied by German forces until the end of the war. Today, Ouvrage Gordolon is open to the public as a historical site.

Flowering occurs from January to March.\n\nTaxonomy and naming\nPrasophyllum mimulum was first formally described in 2004 by David Jones from near Lake Baillie in the Central Plateau Conservation Area of Tasmania and the description was published in The Orchadian. The specific epithet is from the Latin diminutive meaning \"imitating\" or \"mimicking\", referring to the overall similarities between this species and P. alpestre.\n\nDistribution and habitat\nThe highland leek orchid grows in grassland and moorland in subalpine areas of Tasmania.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \n\nmimulum\nFlora of Tasmania\nEndemic orchids of Australia\nPlants described in 2004", "machine_text": "Prasophyllum mimulum is a species of orchid that is native to Australia. It belongs to the genus Prasophyllum, which consists of approximately 170 species of terrestrial orchids found mainly in Australia and New Zealand. The species was first described by the botanist Carl Ludwig Blume in 1856. Prasophyllum mimulum is a small orchid, reaching a height of between 10 and 30 centimeters. It has thick, fleshy leaves that grow in a flat rosette at the base of the stem. The stem itself is slender and erect, and bears a cluster of tiny flowers at its apex. The flowers are generally green or brown in colour, with a faint sweet fragrance. The species is found in a variety of habitats across south-eastern Australia, including heathland, shrubland, and open forest. It is particularly common in the state of Victoria, where it is found in the eastern part of the state. It is also found in Tasmania, South Australia, and New South Wales. Prasophyllum mimulum is not considered to be threatened in the wild, and there are no major threats to its survival. However, as with many orchid species, it is vulnerable to habitat loss due to land clearance, and is also threatened by the spread of invasive plant species. Prasophyllum mimulum is not commonly cultivated, but is occasionally grown by enthusiasts as a challenging plant to cultivate. It requires a well-drained soil that is rich in organic matter, and prefers a cool, moist environment with plenty of shade. It is not generally recommended for beginners due to the difficulty in meeting its specific cultivation requirements.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 56235383}

Founded in 1898 as Decatur Baptist College, Dallas Baptist University currently operates campuses in Dallas, Plano, and Hurst.\n\nHistory\nDecatur Baptist College, the forerunner of Dallas Baptist University, opened its doors in 1898 as the first two-year institution of higher education in Texas.  The Baptist General Convention of Texas purchased the land in 1897 from Northwest Texas Baptist College. The school enjoyed a rich, full history in Decatur until 1965 when it moved to Dallas, at the invitation of the Dallas Baptist Association.\n\nThe school's historic Administration Building in Decatur, built in 1893, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nIn October 1965, Dallas Baptist College began offering classes for a first class of over 900 students. The initial piece of land for the campus, overlooking Mountain Creek Lake in the hill country of southwest Dallas, were donated by John Stemmons, Roland Pelt, and associates.  An interested group of businessmen donated additional acreage, and in 1994 a donation by the Louis Hexter family brought the current size of the DBU campus, known as University Hill, to . In 2018, an additional land acquisition increased the total campus size to 368 acres.\n\nIn 1968, the college moved from junior-college to senior-college status, offering its first four-year bachelor's degrees in May 1970. In 1985, the college name officially became Dallas Baptist University. The new structure consisted of the College of Arts and Sciences, the Mary C. Crowley College of Christian Faith, the Dorothy M. Bush College of Education, and the College of Business.\n\nGrowth and expansion\n\nIn 2019, the university enrolled 4,487 students. The university offers 84 undergraduate majors, 24 master's degree programs, over 45 dual master's programs, and two doctoral programs. While in its early years, the school had the reputation of being a commuter college, today's DBU has well over 2,000 students living on campus.\n\nIn 1992, the John G. Mahler Student Center, the first new building on the DBU campus in more than 20 years was dedicated. The building is a close replica of Independence Hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and it was the first of many new buildings in the Georgian architectural style on the campus.\n\nIn 2009, the Patty and Bo Pilgrim Chapel was dedicated. The structure is used for various events such as chapel services and concerts, and houses office space for the Graduate School of Ministry along with classrooms and a large multipurpose room. The inspiration for the exterior of the building came from the First Baptist Church in America, located in Providence, Rhode Island.\n\n In the fall of 2011, the university opened the Joan and Andy Horner Hall. Named after the founders of Premier Designs, Horner Hall houses the DBU communication department, the offices for the College of Fine Arts, a multipurpose classroom and video recording studio, a design lab, and a music business recording studio, designed by the Russ Berger Design Group. The exterior of the structure is modeled after Congress Hall located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 2001, DBU-North opened in Carrollton, Texas as DBU's first regional academic center, serving North Dallas and Collin County.  For several years, DBU-North was located in Frisco, Texas, and in 2011, moved to Plano, Texas. DBU also opened DBU-Hurst-Colleyville at Hurst in the Summer of 2005.\n\nIn 2015, Jim and Sally Nation Hall opened its doors. A near replica of Monticello, the building is the home of the Gary Cook School of Leadership, as well as other administrative offices. The building also houses several classrooms as well as a special event space situated in the dome of the building.\n\nFurther locations for special programs and opportunities include the Department of Military Science at University of Texas at Arlington (Army ROTC), Aerospace Studies at Texas Christian University (Air Force ROTC), and the Graduate Institute of Applied Linguistics in Dallas Texas.\n\nAcademics\n\nAcademic divisions\nThe university is divided into seven colleges: the Mary C. Crowley College of Christian Faith, the Dorothy M. Bush College of Education, the College of Business, the College of Fine Arts, the College of Humanities and Social Sciences, the College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics, and the College of Professional Studies. The university also houses two schools: the Graduate School of Ministry, as well as the Gary Cook School of Leadership. The university offers the Ed.D. in educational leadership and the Ph.D. in leadership studies through the Cook School of Leadership and the Ed.D. in educational leadership K-12 through the Bush College of Education. The university has 84 undergraduate programs, 24 master's programs, and 2 doctoral programs.\n\nAccreditations\nDallas Baptist University is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.\n\nThe teacher, principal and superintendent education programs of the university are accredited by the State Board for Educator Certification (SBEC).\n\nThe College of Business is nationally accredited by the Association of Collegiate Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP) to offer the Bachelor of Business Administration (B.B.A.) and the Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.) business degrees.\n\nThe Dallas Baptist University Department of Music is accredited by the National Association of Schools of Music (NASM).\n\nDBU is also affiliated with the Baptist General Convention of Texas.\n\nInstitute for Global Engagement \nThe Institute for Global Engagement was founded at DBU in 2015 to be \u201ca Christian, non-partisan think tank dedicated to addressing issues in the public square with biblical distinctiveness\u201d and to be \u201ca moral and spiritual catalyst for renewal in our culture.\u201d  The goal of the institute is to be interdisciplinary in bringing together experts and practitioners from a variety of fields to address issues from a distinctively Christian worldview. Since its founding, the IGE has held several seminars and lectures featuring a variety of individuals, including author Eric Metaxas, physician Dr. Peter Dysart, former presidential speech writer Michael Gerson, political commentator Matthew Dowd, UN Ambassador Samuel Brownback, and former Secretary of Defense Gen. Jim Mattis. The organization also produces \u201cThe Daily Briefing,\u201d an email that goes out three times a week covering the news of the day with a Christian perspective.\n\nRankings and recognition \n U.S. News & World Report ranks Dallas Baptist University, DBU, as 214th among \"National Universities\" in its 2017 edition.\n\nTraditions\nIn its early years, Dallas Baptist University's mascot was the Indians, but in the late 1980s, it was changed to the Patriot, and the school colors were changed from blue and gold to the more patriotic theme colors of red, white, and blue.\n\nCross Ring \nThe Official DBU Cross Ring serves as a symbol of the Christ-centered education students experience at DBU. The ring features many university symbols, including the Mahler Student Center, the Fishers of Men statue, as well as the university seal.\n\nMr. Patriot\nOne of DBU's longest running tradition, stemming from when DBU's mascot was the Indians, is the Mr. Patriot pageant. This anticipated event, formerly named Mr. Big Chief from 1981 to 2018, allows male students to show off their skills, humor, and creativity. The show, a mock beauty pageant, begins with an opening number performed by all the contestants and is followed by three categories: the stamp act (formalwear), the tea act (beachwear), and the intolerable act (talent). The categories were formerly known as just talent, beachwear, and formalwear. Magic tricks, lip-syncing, and musical interpretations are just some of the ways contestants have attempted to gain points in the past. The contestant with the most points at the end wins the coveted title, and has rights to wear the coat and hat that have replaced the headdress on display in the Dean Learning Center as the prize.\n\nFamily events\nFamily Weekend and Grandparents Day allow students to invite their families into their lives on campus. Notable events include the Family Softball Game, Movie on the Quad, and Art Show as well as a family service project. Families are invited to fellowship with their students as well as the university faculty and staff through community activities and other fun events.\n\nUnity Walk \nBeginning in 2017, DBU has held an annual Unity Walk on MLK Day, with the DBU community coming together to remember the world of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and pray for the dream of a unified country to become a reality. In addition to the walk, a special speaker each year recites Dr. King's famous \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech. Also during the day, students, faculty, and staff participate in the service projects in Dallas as a part of the national MLK Day of Service.\n\nAthletics\n\nDallas Baptist University's Patriot Athletic Department sponsors 15 intercollegiate athletics teams that compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the National Christian College Athletic Association (NCCAA).

He was first mentioned in contemporary sources in 1301, when he was the prince of Tropolje together with his brothers. He was also mentioned as the prince of Trogir in 1305, and of Skradin in 1311. Dissatisfied with the division of powers with his brothers, he led, together with other Croatian nobles, a rebellion against his brother, Mladen II, in a desire to gain further power. After his brother's defeat at the battle of Bliska in 1322, he however failed in his intention to inherit the position paramount power in the family, which went to his other brother, George II.\n\nHe subsequently supported Mladen III in the fight against other nobles and King Louis I, for which he received the administration of Ostrovica from Mladen III. Paul bequeathed Ostrovica to his underage son, George III, to whom he appointed his brother Gregory II as guardian.\n\nHe married the Krk princess Elizabeth Frankopan (Elizabeta Kr\u010dka) (date of birth unknown, died in 1347), with whom he had two sons, George III (also known as George I Zrinski) and Pribko, and daughter Katarina.\n\nIn 1347, Gregory II, in the name of George III, handed over Ostrovica and the Luka County to King Louis I, in exchange for the fort of Zrin and other estates in its vicinity.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Tropical Storm Pakhar (2017)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Tropical Storm Pakhar, known in the Philippines as Tropical Storm Jolina, was a strong tropical storm that impacted South China during late August 2017. This storm followed Typhoon Hato which affected the area a few days prior. Pakhar was the fourteenth named storm of the Pacific typhoon season. Pakhar developed from a tropical depression to the east of Luzon during August 24, and intensified into a tropical storm later that day. Pakhar made landfall over in Aurora on August 25. Pakhar gradually intensified and peaked as a severe tropical storm by August 27, making landfall over Taishan, Jiangmen in Southern China.\n\nMeteorological history\n\nOn August 23, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started to monitor a tropical disturbance that had developed about 895\u00a0km (556\u00a0mi) to the north of the island of Palau. The next day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a weak tropical depression, while the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA). Six hours after the TCFA, the JMA began issuing advisories on the depression after they have determined that the system contained winds of 55\u00a0km/h (35\u00a0mph). By 15:00 UTC of the same day, the JTWC had upgraded the system to a tropical depression, assigning the numerical designation 16W. Three hours later, the JMA tracked that 16W had already strengthened into a tropical storm, giving 16W the name Pakhar. Around the same time, the PAGASA began issuing advisories under the local name Jolina. After it was depicted by satellite imagery that there were deep convection obscuring its low-level circulation center (LLCC), the JTWC had upgraded the system to a tropical storm.\n\nBy August 25, Pakhar slightly intensified after convective banding wrapping to its LLCC was depicted by imagery. Pakhar was also located in a very favorable environment such as low wind shear along with warm sea-surface temperatures of 31\u00a0\u00b0C (87.8\u00a0\u00b0F). Pakhar slightly intensified after a burst of deep convection developed just prior of making landfall over in Luzon in the province of Aurora. However, due to land reaction from the archipelago and the inclusion of a weakened convective structure, Pakhar weakened to minimal tropical storm intensity.\n\nAfter emerging to the South China Sea on August 26, Pakhar began to re-intensify as the storm entered in an area of a much lower amount of wind shear. However six hours later, Pakhar maintained its intensity after its LLCC became exposed and its deep convective banding became fragmented. By 18:00 UTC of the same day, the JMA upgraded Pakhar's intensity as a severe tropical storm, despite its central convection remaining disorganized. The PAGASA also stated that the storm had already exited their area of responsibility, issuing its final bulletin on Pakhar. By 00:00 UTC of August 27, Pakhar reached its maximum intensity of 100\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph) with a minimum barometric pressure of 985 hPa while making landfall over in South China in the city of Taishan. The JTWC assessed Pakhar's maximum intensity slightly higher with winds of 110\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph), however. Three hours later, the JTWC issued their final advisory. By 06:00 UTC, Pakhar began to rapidly weaken as the JMA downgraded Pakhar to a tropical storm. The JMA tracked the system until 18:00 UTC of the same day when it fully dissipated.\n\nPreparations and impact\n\nPhilippines\n\nTropical Storm Pakhar was locally named as Jolina within the country by PAGASA. As soon as the PAGASA began issuing advisories on the storm, Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal#1 was raised over most of Cagayan Valley and northern Aurora during August 24. Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal #2 was also raised in the same areas with the inclusion of the Cordillera Administrative Region while Signal #1 was extended to the Ilocos Region and Bicol Region. By August 25, a total of 16 provinces were placed in a warning as they were located within a  radius of the storm. Classes were suspended for all levels over in Albay, Bicol due to possible threats of flooding and landslides on August 25. The government also announced the suspension of classes for August 26 over in Metro Manila and some parts of Central Luzon and Calabarzon. The province of Ilocos Sur declared the suspension of work in all public and private services that same day.\n\nThe Office of the Civil Defense warned residents of low-lying areas in the provinces of Cagayan and Isabela of potential flooding. Kennon Road in Benguet were closed due to the threat of landslides. Hiking, trekking, and caving were suspended over in mountainous areas in the Mountain Province. Heavy rainfall from Pakhar caused the Magat Dam to overflow, which also submerged several bridges over in Isabela. A total of 11 flights to Hong Kong and South China from Ninoy Aquino International Airport were canceled due to the storm. Eight domestic flights were canceled throughout August 25.\n\nAccording to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council, 3,397 people were affected by the storm with 17 reports of flooding. The cities of Balatan, San Fernando and Ifugao suffered power outages throughout the storm. Overall, no casualties have been reported and damages were relatively minor. Recorded damages in Aurora province have reached PH\u20b141.27 million (US$808 thousand).\n\nHong Kong, Macau and South China\nStill recovering from the aftermath of Typhoon Hato which impacted the area four days earlier, the Macao Meteorological and Geophysical Bureau issued a Tropical cyclone signal No. 8 for Macau late on August 26, as the storm approached. An orange typhoon warning was also raised over in the provinces of Shenzhen and Guangzhou while red warning was raised in Zhuhai. A total of 206 flights were cancelled and another 471 delayed while 44 flights had to divert, including roughly 300 flights in total in Hong Kong being either cancelled or delayed, with 30 others diverted. There were 13 reports of flooding and 159 fallen trees over in Hong Kong. Two people were stranded in Kowloon Peak and moreover, the Government Flying Service deployed a Challenger 604 fixed-wing plane to locate 11 crew members waiting in the control room of a sinking Hong Tai 176 vessel.\n\nWhile making landfall, Pakhar brought winds of about 90 km/h (55 mph) with gusts of up to 150 km/h (93 mph) over in Hong Kong, along with nearly 150 mm (6 in) of rainfall. A total of 9,000 emergency repairers, 97 emergency generator vehicles and 1,691 generators are in place in Guangxi and the Yangtze River flood control headquarters dispatched personnel for the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan. \n\nAround 1:00 p.m local time, both the Macau and Hong Kong Observatory lowered their signal to a Tropical cyclone signal No. 3, but it wasn't until 10:10 p.m local time when all signals were down. The Home Affairs Department of Hong Kong opened 27 temporary shelters while the China Ferry Terminal in Tsim Sha Tsui was closed temporarily. Ferry services across the Pearl River Delta were also suspended. Part of the Stonecutters Bridge was closed due to strong winds which made vehicles taller than 1.5 metres and motorcycles barred from using the bridge. Moreover, 51 people sought medical treatment in public hospitals and 231 people have sought refuge in shelters.\n\nAn orange typhoon warning was also raised over in the provinces of Shenzhen and Guangzhou while red warning was raised in Zhuhai. Furthermore, Hainan had a total of 24,124 fishing boats put into harbor. All of the water bus service was paused in Pearl River Delta.\nThe city of Taishan had recorded gusts of 119\u00a0km/h (74\u00a0mph). Pakhar drenched the Pearl River Delta region with the city of Shenzhen having total rainfall of 162\u00a0mm (6.4\u00a0in). The National Meteorological Center of China had forecast torrential rain over in the South China provinces from August 27\u201328, especially Guangdong and Guangxi could reach up to 1800\u00a0mm (71\u00a0in) of rain. A total of 9,000 emergency repairers, 97 emergency generator vehicles and 1,691 generators are in place in Guangxi and the Yangtze River flood control headquarters dispatched personnel for the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan.\n\nA total of 83,000 people were affected by the storm, along with 14,000 people in which were evacuated over in the four main affected regions of Guandong, Guangxi, Guizhou and Yunnan. One person died from a traffic incident while 62 were injured, while an additional two were confirmed hours later. Overall, 12 people were killed by Pakhar, and damages have reached CN\u00a5760 million (US$114.4 million).\n\nElsewhere\nThe remnants of Pakhar caused heavy rainfall in B\u1eafc K\u1ea1n Province, Vietnam. It cost 2 billion\u20ab (US$88,000) in damage. Pakhar brought extreme rainfall over in some parts of Thailand despite it not having any direct impact. Due to the torrential rain, a major reservoir in Sakon Nakhon had to be discharged, leading to a flood watch being issued in the northern parts of the country on August 28. The Nam Pung Dam also carried about 170 million cubic meters of water, about 3% over its usual holding capacity.\n\nSee also\n\nWeather of 2017\nTropical cyclones in 2017\n Other systems named Pakhar\n Tropical Storm Nida (2016)\n Tropical Storm Linfa (2015)\n Tropical Storm Soudelor (2009)\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n JMA General Information of Severe Tropical Storm Pakhar (1714) from Digital Typhoon\n\n 16W.PAKHAR from the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory\n South China Morning Post Topic : Typhoon Hato\n\n2017 disasters in China\n2017 disasters in the Philippines\n2017 in Hong Kong\n2017 Pacific typhoon season\nAugust 2017 events in China\nAugust 2017 events in the Philippines\nTyphoons in China\nTyphoons in Hong Kong\nTyphoons in the Philippines\nPakhar", "machine_text": "Tropical Storm Pakhar was the sixteenth named storm of the 2017 Pacific typhoon season. It formed on August 26, 2017, as a tropical depression and further intensified into a tropical storm in the South China Sea. Pakhar made landfall in Guangdong province in China on August 27, 2017, with maximum winds of 65 mph (104 km/h), causing significant damage and disruption in the region. Path and Impact Tropical Storm Pakhar originated from a low-pressure area in the northern Philippines and moved northwestward over the western Pacific Ocean. It developed rapidly into a tropical depression on August 26, 2017, and continued towards the west-northwest direction. Soon after, it intensified into a tropical storm with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (75 km/h) and gusts of up to 65 mph (105 km/h) near the center. On August 27, 2017, Pakhar made landfall near Taishan city in Guangdong province, China, with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph (105 km/h). The storm brought heavy rains and strong winds to the region, causing significant damage and disruption. At least seven people were killed, and several others were injured. The local authorities issued a red alert for the province, which led to the evacuation of thousands of people from the danger zones. Pakhar also caused significant damage to infrastructure, including buildings, roads, and bridges, in Guangdong province. The storm disrupted air, land, and sea transport in the region, forcing the cancellation of hundreds of flights and trains. Aftermath The Chinese government responded promptly to the disaster and mobilized resources to aid the affected communities. The authorities provided temporary shelters, food, and medicine to the people displaced by the storm. They also initiated repair and restoration works in the affected areas. Tropical Storm Pakhar was the second storm to hit China in August 2017. Earlier in the month, Typhoon Hato made landfall in Guangdong province, causing extensive damage and claiming several lives. The double impact of these two storms underlined the need for robust disaster preparedness and response mechanisms in the region. Conclusion Tropical Storm Pakhar was a significant weather event in the 2017 Pacific typhoon season, causing loss of life and property in Guangdong province, China. The authorities responded promptly to the disaster and provided relief to the affected communities.

It was originally recorded for 1980's Double Fantasy album, with John Lennon. A remix was released on iTunes on 25 September 2012. The remix debuted at number 39, and peaked at number 4.\n\nRecording\nDuring the Double Fantasy sessions, on August 12, 1980, a version of \"I'm Moving On\" was recorded with a lineup that included Cheap Trick guitarist Rick Nielsen and Cheap Trick drummer Bun E. Carlos.  Tony Levin played bass guitar, since Cheap Trick bassist Tom Petersson had recently left the group. The same lineup also recorded a version of Lennon's \"I'm Losing You\" the same day.  Neither song was released on Double Fantasy in their Cheap Trick-backed version.  Possible reasons for their exclusions are that Cheap Trick's management may have wanted too much money, or that Lennon believed that the performances were more \"heavy\" than he wanted.  On August 26, a revised version of \"I'm Moving On\" was recorded with the regular Double Fantasy session musicians consisting of Hugh McCracken and Earl Slick on guitar, Tony Levin on bass guitar, George Small on keyboards, Arthur Jenkins on percussion and Andy Newmark on drums.  Ono recorded her lead vocal on September 19.\n\nLyrics and music\n\"I'm Moving On\" is in some ways a companion piece to Lennon's \"I'm Losing You,\" which immediately precedes on Double Fantasy.  The songs are linked musically by series of electronic beeps and by a guitar lick played by Earl Slick, and share the same rhythm.  Producer Jack Douglas originally wanted the songs to be linked via a drum pattern he wanted Bun E. Carlos to play. \"I'm Losing You\" expresses Lennon's pain at the thought of losing Yoko Ono during a difficult time in their marriage.  \"I'm Moving On\" also addresses the possible loss of their relationship, but expresses her feelings of independence and willingness to say farewell.  Basically, \"I'm Moving On\" rebuffs Lennon's plea in \"I'm Losing You.\"  The singer accuses her lover of being false, objecting to his \"window smile,\" and warns him that she has no desire for intimacy with lines such as \"don't stick your finger in my pie.\"  Rock journalist Paul Du Noyer calls \"I'm Moving On\" an \"angry song\" expressing a \"harsh goodbye.\"  Ono stated to David Sheff of Playboy Magazine that the song is about \"the sense of 'Well, I've had enough.  I'm moving on.'  But it's not about any specific incident.  It's just the feeling: 'I don't want to play games.  I like everything straight.'  That's a feeling I have had.  I'm proud of the song.\"\n\nOther versions\nIn 2007, a version of \"I'm Moving On\" appeared on Ono's album Yes, I'm a Witch.  On this version, Ono was backed by The Sleepy Jackson.  Allmusic critic Thom Jurek doesn't think this \"synthetic disco take\" works very well for the song.\n\nTrack list\nRemixes\n \"I'm Moving On\" (Papercha$er radio mix) \u2013 4:01\n \"I'm Moving On\" (Papercha$er vocal mix) \u2013 6:08\n \"I'm Moving On\" (Papercha$er Money mix) \u2013 6:08\n \"I'm Moving On\" (Papercha$er remix) \u2013 6:08\n \"I'm Moving On\" (Papercha$er instrumental) \u2013 6:08\n \"I'm Moving On\" (Ralphi Rosario Radio Mix) \u2013 3:56\n \"I'm Moving On\" (Ralphi Rosario vox mix) \u2013 7:51\n \"I'm Moving On\" (Ralphi Rosario dub) \u2013 7:51\n \"I'm Moving On\" (Sted-E and Hybrid Heights remix) \u2013 5:28\n \"I'm Moving On\" (Sted-E and Hybrid Heights dub) \u2013 5:44\n\nRemixes Part 2\n \"I'm Moving On\" (Starkillers remix) \u2013 5:37\n \"I'm Moving On\" (Starkillers dub) \u2013 5:27\n \"I'm Moving On\" (Superchumbo remix) \u2013 7:03\n \"I'm Moving On\" (Superchumbo dub) \u2013 6:36\n \"I'm Moving On\" (Dave Aude club mix) \u2013 5:32\n \"I'm Moving On\" (Dave Aude dub) \u2013 5:47\n \"I'm Moving On\" (Dave Aude radio edit) \u2013 3:44\n \"I'm Moving On\" (Frankie & Eric's directors cut mix) \u2013 8:47\n \"I'm Moving On\" (Frankie & Eric's directors cut dub) \u2013 6:39\n\nCharts\n\nWeekly charts\n\nReferences\n\n2012 singles\nYoko Ono songs\n1980 songs\nSongs written by Yoko Ono\nSong recordings produced by Yoko Ono\nSong recordings produced by John Lennon\nSong recordings produced by Jack Douglas (record producer)", "machine_text": "\"I'm Moving On\" is a song by Yoko Ono, released in 1974 on her album \"A Story\". The song has since been covered by several artists, including Chaka Khan and John Lennon. The song features Ono's signature avant-garde style, with sparse instrumentation and haunting vocals. The lyrics speak of letting go and moving on from a past relationship, with lines like \"I'm moving on, leaving behind what's gone.\" Despite being released during a time when Ono's solo work was often overshadowed by her relationship with Lennon, \"I'm Moving On\" has since become a fan favorite and a testament to Ono's artistry. The song's message of resilience and personal growth has resonated with listeners over the years, and many have interpreted it as Ono's statement on her own journey in the wake of Lennon's tragic death in 1980. In 1995, \"I'm Moving On\" was covered by legendary R&B singer Chaka Khan for her album \"Dare You to Love Me\". The cover featured more upbeat instrumentation and Khan's powerhouse vocals, but still maintained the song's emotional intensity. John Lennon also covered the song during his and Ono's \"Lost Weekend\" period, although the recording was not officially released until years later. Overall, \"I'm Moving On\" remains a powerful and poignant song, highlighting Yoko Ono's importance as both an avant-garde artist and a trailblazer for female musicians in the male-dominated rock industry.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 37121650}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Petunia Pig\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Petunia Pig is an animated cartoon character in the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of cartoons from Warner Bros. She looks much like her significant other, Porky Pig, except that she wears a dress and has pigtailed black hair.\n\nBiography\nPetunia was introduced by animator Frank Tashlin in the 1937 short Porky's Romance. The film is a parody of a 1932 Walt Disney cartoon called Mickey's Nightmare. Whereas Mickey Mouse marries his longtime girlfriend Minnie in that film, Porky's overtures toward Petunia bring him only the scornful laughter of his porcine paramour. Tashlin adopted Petunia as a regular member of Porky's entourage and featured her in two more cartoons: The Case of the Stuttering Pig and Porky's Double Trouble, both in 1937.\n\nBob Clampett was the only other Warner director to utilize Petunia after Tashlin left the studio in 1938. He first featured her in Porky's Picnic, a 1939 film that sees Porky tormented by his nephew Pinkie. Pinkie and Porky's encounters are always out of sight of Petunia, of course, so she blames Porky for everything that goes wrong as a result of Pinkie's activity. Petunia's largest role came in Clampett's 1939 short Naughty Neighbors. The film borrows elements from both the famous feud between the Hatfields and McCoys as well as Romeo and Juliet as Porky and Petunia's love for each other is stymied by their respective hillbilly families' mutual hatred. Despite her more prominent role in the short, Petunia is only a supporting character; Porky remains the star.\n\nAs Porky's popularity was eclipsed in the late 1930s and early 1940s by brasher characters like Daffy Duck and Bugs Bunny, he was relegated to a supporting player himself in new Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies shorts. Petunia, already a bit player to Porky's lead, fared much worse. She still appeared occasionally in Warner's merchandising, but her tenure as a Warner Bros. player was mostly over.\n\nLater appearances\nNevertheless, in modern years Petunia has enjoyed multiple new roles:\n\n Petunia has a co-starring role in Filmation's lone Looney Tunes-related production, Daffy Duck and Porky Pig Meet the Groovie Goolies, in 1972. She is voiced by Jane Webb.\n Petunia made a cameo appearance in the 1979 short Bugs Bunny's Christmas Carol as Mrs. Cratchit, wife of Bob Cratchit (played by Porky Pig), though she had no speaking lines.\n Originally Petunia intended to appear as a cameo with Porky in the film Who Framed Roger Rabbit in the deleted scene \"Acme's Funeral\".\n Petunia made a cameo appearance in Tiny Toon Adventures in the episode \"It's a Wonderful Tiny Toon Christmas Special\".\n An infant version of Petunia was a recurring character in the Baby Looney Tunes television series, where she was voiced by Chiara Zanni.\n The regular adult Petunia is an occasional guest star in DC's Looney Tunes comic book and appeared frequently in 2001-2005 webtoons on the official Looney Tunes website.\n She also turned up in Duck Dodgers, playing the role of Princess Incense (voiced by Jodi Benson).\n Petunia appeared on The Looney Tunes Show in the episodes \"Here Comes the Pig\" and \"Mr. Wiener\", voiced by Katy Mixon.\n Petunia  is a playable character in the mobile game \"Looney Tunes: World of Mayhem\", along with Farmer, Lunar, and Athena variants of herself. \n Petunia appears in several New Looney Tunes segments, voiced by Jessica DiCicco.\n Petunia also appears in Looney Tunes Cartoons, voiced by Lara Jill Miller, which for the first time she has a solo appearance. In this portrayal, she has a Brooklyn accent similar to Bugs Bunny.\n\nExternal links\nLeague of Comic Geeks page\nBehind the Voice Actors\n\nReferences\n\nPig, Petunia\nPig, Petunia\nFilm characters introduced in 1937\nFemale characters in animation", "machine_text": "Petunia Pig is a fictional character in the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of cartoons.

In contrast to Porky, who is often depicted as bumbling and nervous, Petunia is confident and self-assured. She is also portrayed as intelligent and self-reliant. In many of the cartoons, Petunia and Porky's relationship is depicted as a courting one. Porky often goes to great lengths to impress Petunia or win her affections. However, Petunia is usually unimpressed by Porky's antics and is more interested in his sincerity and caring nature. Petunia has appeared in numerous Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies shorts over the years, including \"Piggy's Diner\" (1939), \"The Major Lied 'Til Dawn\" (1941), and \"Hush My Mouse\" (1946).

The site was included in the National Register of Historic Places in 1984 for its historic importance.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Polvor\u00edn was built on orders of Field Marshal Alejandro O'Reilly, who visited the island in 1765 to gauge the status of the island defenses on a request of King Charles III. Among O'Reilly's recommendations was the construction of five ammunition storage (or polvor\u00edn) to support the other artillery structures on the island. Some accounts state the specific construction date as 1770 and others as 1776.\n\nWhen the Spanish\u2013American War ended in 1898, United States took control of the island. From that time until the 1930s, the Polvor\u00edn de Miraflores was used as a quarantine station under the administration of the United States Public Health Service. Ship passengers and immigrants were inspected here and, if necessary, were isolated from the population.\n\nSince the 1940s, the building was repurposed as a chapel for the Isla Grande Naval Base. As a result, some changes were made to the structure, like the replacement of the chimney with a bell tower. The structure was then renamed Santa B\u00e1rbara Chapel.\n\nWhen the Naval Base closed in 1971, the structure was handed to the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture. During this time, it was used as the setting for the San Juan Ballets and the San Juan Choir. Since 1984, it became part of the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nEventually, the building was taken by the Puerto Rico Department of Transportation and Public Works and the property was used for the storage of vehicles. With time, the property became abandoned and deteriorated. Recently, the structure was handed to the Convention Center District which prompted the removal of the abandoned vehicles from the property.\n\nSee also\n\n List of communities in Puerto Rico\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Ruins of Miraflores Magazine and Isla Grande\n\nMagazines (artillery)\nBuildings and structures in San Juan, Puerto Rico\nBuildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Puerto Rico\nNational Register of Historic Places in San Juan, Puerto Rico\nMilitary facilities on the National Register of Historic Places\nSpanish Colonial architecture in Puerto Rico", "machine_text": "Polvor\u00edn de Miraflores, also known as the Miraflores Powder Depot, is a historic building located in the district of Miraflores in Lima, Peru.

The lower level was used as the storage chamber while the upper level served as the office for the Explosive Material Inspection Board. The architecture of the building reflects the military design that was popular during the colonial era. In 1824, during the Battle of Ayacucho, the depot was targeted by the Spanish troops to disrupt the supply of ammunition to the Peruvian troops. However, they were unsuccessful in destroying the building. The building has survived various natural disasters and remains a significant testament to the country's history. In 1965, the building was declared a National Historic Monument and underwent significant renovations to turn it into an art center. Today, it operates as a public art center, hosting exhibitions, concerts, and other cultural events. The building offers workshops for adults and children in subjects such as dance, theater, and creative writing.

It was a  Luna Ye-6 spacecraft, the fifth of twelve to be launched. It was intended to be the first spacecraft to perform a soft landing on the Moon, a goal which would eventually be accomplished by the final Ye-6 spacecraft, Luna 9.\n\nLuna E-6 No.5 was launched at 08:08:28 UTC on 20 April 1964, atop a Molniya-M 8K78M carrier rocket, flying from Site 1/5 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. The power system on the upper stage malfunctioned 340 seconds into the flight, causing the engine to cut off before reaching orbit. The upper stage and spacecraft disintegrated upon reentry into the atmosphere shortly afterwards.

The Luna E-6 No.5 spacecraft was launched aboard Luna 11K65 carrier rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in what is now Kazakhstan. The spacecraft weighed approximately 1,425 kilograms, and its main objective was to land on the moon's surface and collect soil samples. After landing on the moon's surface, the spacecraft began collecting soil samples and transmitting data back to Earth. However, the mission was met with several challenges, including difficulty in collecting samples due to the moon's rocky terrain. Despite these challenges, the spacecraft was able to collect samples and send them back to Earth for analysis. One of the significant accomplishments of the Luna E-6 No.5 mission was the discovery of the presence of water on the moon's surface. The discovery of water on the moon was a significant milestone in space exploration, and it opened up possible opportunities for future space missions. The Luna E-6 No.5 spacecraft remained on the moon's surface and continued to transmit data back to Earth until October 1, 1965. The spacecraft was ultimately disassembled and left on the moon's surface. In conclusion, the Luna E-6 No.5 spacecraft was a significant milestone in space exploration, and its discoveries and achievements have helped shape our understanding of the moon's surface.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Clone (computing)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "In computing, a clone is hardware or software that is designed to function in exactly the same way as another system. A specific subset of clones are remakes (or remades), which are revivals of old, obsolete, or discontinued products.\n\nMotivation \nClones and remakes are created for some reasons, including competition, standardization, availability across platforms, and even as homage. Compatibility with the original system is usually the explicit purpose of cloning hardware or low-level software such as operating systems (e.g. AROS and MorphOS are intended to be compatible with AmigaOS). Application software is cloned by providing the same functionality.\n\nCommercially-motivated clones are made often during a competitor product's initial successful commercial run, intentionally competing with the original and trying to participate in their success.\n\nHardware\n\nHardware clones\nWhen IBM announced the IBM PC in 1981, other companies such as Compaq decided to offer clones of the PC as a legal reimplementation from the PC's documentation or reverse engineering. Because most of the components, except the PC's BIOS, were publicly available, all Compaq had to do was reverse-engineer the BIOS. The result was a machine with similar performance and lower price than the machines cloned. The use of the term \"PC clone\" to describe IBM PC compatible computers fell out of use in the 1990s; the class of machines it now describes are simply called PCs, but the early use of the term \"clone\" usually implied a higher level of compatibility with the original IBM PC than \"PC-Compatible\", with (often Taiwanese) clones of the original circuit (and possibly ROMs) the most compatible (in terms of software they would run and hardware tests they would pass), while \"legitimate\" new designs such as the Sanyo MBC-550 and Data General One, while not infringing on copyrights and adding innovations, tended to fail some compatibility tests strongly dependent upon detailed hardware compatibility (such as ability to run Microsoft Flight Simulator, or any software that bypassed the standard software interrupts and directly accessed hardware at the expected pre-defined locations, or\u2014in the case of the MBC-550 for example\u2014wrote diskettes which could not be directly interchanged with standard IBM PCs).\n\nWhile the term has mostly fallen into commercial disuse, the term clone for PCs still applies to a PC made to entry-level or above standard (at the time it was made) which bears no commercial branding (e.g., Acer, IBM, HP, Dell). This includes, but is not limited to, PCs assembled by home users or Corporate IT Departments. (See also White box (computer hardware).)\n\nThere were many Nintendo Entertainment System hardware clones due to the popularity and longevity of the Nintendo Entertainment System.\n\nHardware remakes\nExamples for hardware remakes are e.g. recent home computer remakes.\n\nA special kind of hardware remakes are emulators which implement the hardware functionality completely in software. For instance the WinUAE emulator software tries to behave exactly like a physical Amiga.\n\nSoftware\nSoftware can be cloned by reverse engineering or legal reimplementation from documentation or other sources, or by observing a program's appearance and behavior. The reasons for software cloning may include circumventing undesirable licensing fees, acquiring knowledge about the features of the system or creating an interoperable alternative for an unsupported platform. GNU, a clone of UNIX, was motivated by a need of the Free Software Movement for an operating system composed of entirely free software.\n\nIn the United States, the case of Lotus v. Borland allows the functionality of a program to be cloned so long as copyright in the code and interface is not infringed.\n\nYet the public interface may also be subject to copyright to the extent that it contains expression (such as the appearance of an icon). For example, in August 2012, Electronic Arts, via its Maxis division, put forth a lawsuit against Zynga, claiming that its Facebook game, The Ville was a direct clone of EA's own Facebook game, The Sims Social. The lawsuit challenges that The Ville not only copies the gameplay mechanics of The Sims Social, but also uses art and visual interface aspects that appear to be inspired by The Sims Social. The two companies settled out of court on undisclosed terms in February 2013.\n\nExamples of software cloning include the ReactOS project which tries to clone Microsoft Windows, and GNU Octave, which treats incompatibility with MathWorks MATLAB as a bug.\n\nVideo games \n\nSince the start of the video game industry, clones of successful concepts and games have been common. The first influential first-person shooter, Doom, led in the 1990s to the creation of a new genre dubbed as Doom clones. In the 2000s the open world action-adventure Grand Theft Auto inspired the creation of many Grand Theft Auto clones.\n\nSoftware remakes\n\nRemakes of software are revivals of old, obsolete, or discontinued software (e.g. Abandonware).\n\nA good share of software remakes are Fangames of computer games and Game engine recreation made by the fan community as part of retrogaming, to address e.g. compatibility issues or non-availability of the original, e.g. a shutdown server gets substituted with a server emulator.\n\nSince the 2000s there has been an increasing number of commercial remakes of classical games by the original developer or publisher for current platforms as the digital distribution lowers the investment risk for niche releases. When enhanced in some way (audio, graphics, etc.) new releases might be called \"High definition\" release or \"Special edition\", an example is The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition.\n\nOther uses of the term\n\nDatabases\nA database clone is a complete and separate copy of a database system that includes the business data, the DBMS software and any other application tiers that make up the environment. Cloning is a different kind of operation to replication and backups in that the cloned environment is both fully functional and separate in its own right. Additionally the cloned environment may be modified at its inception due to configuration changes or data subsetting.\n\nDesktop\n\nSince 2010 clone computing, in the sense of replicating a session on a host computer in a virtual instance in the cloud, has been introduced.  This allows the user to have access to a copy of their PC's desktop on any other computing device such as a tablet computer, a personal computer running any operating system, WebOS, smartphones, etc.\n\nThe clone computer replicates, runs, and is always available through a series of cloud servers.  Unlike remote management software, clone computing has no dependency on the host computer.\n\nDisk cloning software\n\nDisk cloning is the process of copying the contents of one computer hard drive to another disk or to an \"image\" file. Typically, the contents of the first disk are written to an image file as an intermediate step, and the second disk is loaded with the contents of the image. A cloned drive can replace the original, rather than simply containing backup copies of files.\n\nCloning software replicates the operating system, drives, software and patches of one computer for a variety of purposes, including setting up multiple computers, hard drive upgrades, and system recovery in the event of disk failure or corruption.\n\nProgramming\n\nIn computer programming, particularly object-oriented programming, cloning refers to object copying by a method or copy factory function, often called clone or copy, as opposed to by a copy constructor. Cloning is polymorphic, in that the type of the object being cloned need not be specified, in contrast to using a copy constructor, which requires specifying the type (in the constructor call).\n\nSee also \n Plug compatible\n Video game clone\n Video game remake\n Game engine recreation\n :Category:Computer hardware clones\n :Category:Video game console remakes\n\nReferences\n\nComputing terminology", "machine_text": "Clone computing refers to the creation of a replica of a system or a software program. It is a technology that enables the replication of an entire system, including its operating system, applications, and data, to another computer or device. The cloned system is an exact replica of the original with its exact configuration, data, and settings. Cloning is used in various fields, including computer networking, virtualization, and software development. A clone of a network enables administrators to replicate a network\u2019s topology, configuration, and traffic patterns for test purposes. Virtualization clones allow users to create multiple virtual machines from a single system, each of which can run different applications simultaneously. In software development, cloning facilitates the rapid deployment of applications to multiple environments, such as test, staging, and production. Cloning is achieved through various methods, including disk imaging and software-based cloning. Disk imaging involves creating a backup image file of a system or hard drive using software tools such as Norton Ghost or Acronis True Image. The backup image can then be restored onto another computer or device to create a clone. In software-based cloning, the software tool creates a copy of the system or application files to another location and updates the configuration and settings to match the original. Cloning has several benefits, including reduced deployment time, cost savings, and increased efficiency. Cloning allows IT teams to deploy identical systems faster, reducing the time required to manually configure each system separately. By using an exact copy of a system or program, IT teams can also decrease the cost of hardware and software required. Cloning also enables IT teams to keep systems up to date by quickly replicating updates and patches to multiple systems. Despite the benefits, cloning also poses some risks, including data loss and security vulnerabilities. Since cloning requires copying data, it can lead to data loss in case the backup process is not done correctly. Additionally, clones can inherit vulnerabilities present in the original system or application, exposing them to potential threats. In conclusion, cloning is a valuable technology that enables the quick replication of software programs and systems. Its benefits include faster deployment, cost savings, and increased efficiency. However, it is essential to mitigate its risks and ensure proper backup processes to avoid data loss and security breaches.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 874123}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Palestinian literature\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Palestinian literature refers to the Arabic language novels, short stories and poems produced by Palestinians. Forming part of the broader genre of Arabic literature, contemporary Palestinian literature is often characterized by its heightened sense of irony and the exploration of existential themes and issues of identity. References to the subjects of resistance to occupation, exile, loss, and love and longing for homeland are also common.\n\nHistorical Origins\nPalestinian literature is one of numerous Arabic literatures, but its affiliation is national, rather than territorial. While Egyptian literature is that written in Egypt, Jordanian literature is that written in Jordan etc., and up until the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli war, Palestinian literature was also territory-bound, since the 1948 Palestinian exodus it has become \"a literature written by Palestinians\" irrespective of their place of residence.\n\nOverview\n\nPalestinian Literature spoke to other causes of oppression and discrimination across the world. In his book, one of the foremost leaders of Palestinian literature and the person who coined the term Palestinian Resistance Literature, Ghassan Kanafani says, \"In my stories I give my characters the freedom to express their own positions without reservation\". This sense of international solidarity can also be found in Palestinian poets' work such as in Mahmoud Darwish's poem Cuban Chants, \"And the banner in Cuba.. The rebel raises it in the Aures.. Oh a nation that feels cold\", and in Samih Al-Qasim's poem, Birds Without Wings.\n\nIn the period between the 1948 Palestinian exodus and the 1967 Six-Day War, Palestinian Resistance Literature played a significant role in maintaining the Palestinian identity; forming a bridge between the two periods, which allowed the Palestinian identity to survive especially in the absence of armed resistance. In his book, Palestinian Resistance Literature Under Occupation, Ghassan Kanafani argues, \"Palestinian resistance literature, just like armed resistance, shapes a new circle in the historical series which practically has not been cut throughout the last half century in the Palestinian life\u201d. \n \nSince 1967, most critics have theorized the existence of three \"branches\" of Palestinian literature, loosely divided by geographic location: 1) from inside Israel, 2) from the occupied territories, 3) from among the Palestinian diaspora throughout the Middle East.\n\nHannah Amit-Kochavi recognizes only two branches: that written by Palestinians from inside the State of Israel as distinct from that written outside. She also posits a temporal distinction between literature produced before 1948 and that produced thereafter. In a 2003 article published in the Studies in the Humanities journal, Steven Salaita posits a fourth branch made up of English language works, particularly those written by Palestinians in the United States, which he defines as \"writing rooted in diasporic countries but focused in theme and content on Palestine.\" However, Maurice Ebileeni argues that a fourth branch referring exclusively to anglophone literary works is not sufficient. Rather, Palestinian displacement both in Israel/Palestine and the diaspora have led to cultural and lingual diversification among Palestinians that exceeds experiences in Arabic- and English-speaking locations. Ebileeni suggest a polylingual branch that entails works by Palestinian authors - or authors of Palestinian descent - written in English as well as Italian, Spanish, Danish, Hebrew and several other languages.\n\nPalestinian literature can be intensely political, as underlined by writers like Salma Khadra Jayyusi and novelist Liana Badr, who have mentioned the need to give expression to the Palestinian \"collective identity\" and the \"just case\" of their struggle. There is also resistance to this school of thought, whereby Palestinian artists have \"rebelled\" against the demand that their art be \"committed\". Poet Mourid Barghouti for example, has often said that \"poetry is not a civil servant, it's not a soldier, it's in nobody's employ.\" Rula Jebreal's novel Miral tells the story of Hind Husseini's effort to establish an orphanage in Jerusalem after the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War, the Deir Yassin Massacre, and the establishment of the state of Israel.\n\nNovels and short stories\nSusan Abulhawas book Mornings in Jenin tells the story of a Palestinian family lost their homes during the 1948 war. In A Rift in Time author  Raja Shehadeh explored the relationship between the decline of the Ottoman Empire, British colonialism and Palestinian self-identity in a novel about his great-uncle Najib Nassar.\nShort stories in Palestinian literature started with writers like Samira Azam.\n\nPoetry\n\nPoetry, using classic pre-Islamic forms, remains an extremely popular art form, often attracting Palestinian audiences in the thousands. Until 20 years ago, local folk bards reciting traditional verses were a feature of every Palestinian town.\n\nAfter the 1948 Palestinian exodus, poetry was transformed into a vehicle for political activism. From among those Palestinians who became Arab citizens of Israel and after the passage of the Citizenship Law of 1952, a school of resistance poetry was born that included poets like Mahmoud Darwish, Samih al-Qasim, and Tawfiq Zayyad.\n\nThe work of these poets was largely unknown to the wider Arab world for years because of the lack of diplomatic relations between Israel and Arab governments. The situation changed after Ghassan Kanafani, another Palestinian writer in exile in Lebanon published an anthology of their work in 1966.\n\nThe work of Nathalie Handal  an award-winning poet, playwright, and writer appeared in numerous anthologies and magazines. She has been translated into twelve languages. She has promoted international literature through translation, research, and the edited The Poetry of Arab Women, an anthology that introduced several Arab women poets to a wider audience in the west.\n\nPalestinian poets often write about the common theme of a strong affection and sense of loss and longing for a lost homeland. In a poem about the Israeli bombing of Lebanon, published in the Palestinian literary magazine al-Karmel, Mahmoud Darwish wrote:\nSmoke rises from me, I reach out a hand to collect my limbs scattered from so many bodies, besieged from land and sky and sea and language. The last plane has taken off from Beirut airport and left me in front of the screen to watch\nwith millions of viewers\nthe rest of my death \nAs for my heart, I see it roll, like a pine cone, from Mount Lebanon, to Gaza.\n\nHakawati\nThe art of story telling was for a long time part of the cultural life in Arabic speaking countries of the Middle East. The tradition of \u201cTales From a Thousand and One Nights\u201d is not an exception. In each small town or village of Palestine, itinerant story tellers called hakawati would visit and tell folk stories they knew, often in teahouses. The tales of the hakawati, once told for all ages, are now sometimes emerging from the Palestinian diaspora as children's books.\n\nSee also\n Palestine Festival of Literature\n Palestinian art\n Palestinian handicrafts\n Palestinian music\n Palestinian National Theatre\n Speak, Bird, Speak Again\n\nReferences\n\nAdditional references\n Alvarado-Larroucau, Carlos, \u00c9critures palestiniennes francophones ; Qu\u00eate d\u2019identit\u00e9 en espace n\u00e9ocolonial, Paris, \u00c9ditions L\u2019Harmattan, coll. \u00ab Critiques litt\u00e9raires \u00bb, 2009.\n\nExternal links\nReview of the anthology Qissat: Short Stories by Palestinian Women\nGoogle Books Sonia Nimr, Hannah Shaw, Ghada Karmi (2008) \u201cGhaddar the Ghoul and Other Palestinian Stories\u201d, frances lincoln ltd, \nPalestinian Literature: News and Reviews at IMEU.net\nMornings in Jenin by Susan Abulhawa review\n\n \nLiterature by ethnicity", "machine_text": "Palestinian literature refers to literary works created by Palestinian authors, both within the region of Palestine/Israel and in diaspora communities around the world.

Palestinian writers often use their works to explore themes of identity, displacement, and resistance, grappling with the complex realities of living in a conflict zone. Palestinian literature is diverse and multifaceted, encompassing both Arabic and English-language works. There are a number of established Palestinian literary figures, including Mahmoud Darwish, Ghassan Kanafani, and Fadwa Tuqan, whose works have gained wide international recognition. The Palestinian literary scene has also been shaped by the establishment of institutions such as the Al-Quds University Institute of Modern Media and the Palestine Writing Workshop, which have provided space for Palestinian writers to hone their craft and collaborate with one another. Palestinian literature has faced numerous challenges in recent years, including censorship and limits on freedom of expression.

The peak, which is visible from the bay, had been named Formosa by the earlier Portuguese explorer, Bartolomeu Dias, in 1488. This was corrupted to Moses, a name still used for the region north of the mountain. Perestrelo, a survivor of the 1554 wrecking of the Portuguese carrack, the S\u00e3o Bento off Msikaba on the Wild Coast, wrote an account of the disaster.\n\nBecause of its elevation and sweeping views, Formosa Peak is a popular hiking destination, the normal road approach being from the north via Langkloof and farm tracks. Although not technically difficult and requiring only steep scrambling, the hiking route follows a narrow ridge with precipitous drops on either side and along some sections, a fall would prove fatal. A recent death on 2 January 2013 was that of Ken Webb, a 72-year-old experienced hiker from Plettenberg Bay, who fell while descending the mountain.\n\nReferences\n\nMountains of the Eastern Cape", "machine_text": "Formosa Peak is a mountainous peak located in the eastern region of Taiwan. It is also called Qilai South Peak and is part of Taiwan's Central Mountain Range. The peak is known for its steep slopes and is one of the highest points in Taiwan, standing at an elevation of 3,339meters (10,953ft) above sea level. Formosa Peak is one of the most challenging peaks to climb due to its technical difficulty and unpredictable weather conditions. The peak was previously known as \"Chilai South Peak\" before being renamed Formosa Peak in 1949. The name \u2018Formosa\u2019 came from the Portuguese phrase \u201cIlha Formosa,\u201d which means \u2018beautiful island.\u2019 This was the term used by the Portuguese explorers when they first arrived on the island of Taiwan. In 1949, when the Kuomintang government moved to Taiwan from mainland China, they renamed a number of places in Taiwan, including Chilai South Peak, which was changed to Formosa Peak. Formosa Peak is a popular destination for hikers. The peak can be accessed from different hiking trails, but the two most popular trails are the Wu-Ling Route and the Baiyue Trail. The Wu-Ling Route is the most challenging route, and typically takes 2-3 days to complete. The Baiyue Trail, on the other hand, is the most popular and offers beautiful views of the surrounding landscape. It takes around 10-12 hours to complete the Baiyue Trail. The views from Formosa Peak are breathtaking. The peak offers a 360-degree view of the surrounding landscape and the eastern coast of Taiwan. The surrounding area is also home to some of Taipei's most beautiful waterfalls, streams and bamboo forests. In addition to hiking, Formosa Peak is also a popular destination for rock climbing and camping. The mountain is known for its steep, rocky terrain, which provides a challenging, but rewarding experience for rock climbers. Campers can also enjoy the beauty of the mountain range and surrounding wilderness. However, due to the unpredictable weather conditions, it is essential to plan ahead and prepare for any eventualities. Overall, Formosa Peak is a truly magnificent peak and a must-visit destination for outdoor enthusiasts.

PTTGC then followed the operation procedures for oil spill management. The Company used boats and airplanes to spray oil-spill dispersants, 0,612 litres of Slickgone NS and 6,930 litres of Super-Dispersant 25, which are permitted by the Department of Pollution Control to be used in Thailand, because they have low toxicity, are biodegradable and do not bio-accumulate or cause mutation and degeneration. It released also a boom to contain the spilled oil within the area. However, the boom did not work well due to bad weather.\n\nOn the night of 28 July 2013, the oil leak (from a pipeline)  from the beach at Ko Samet's Coconut Bay (Ao Phrao) resulted in the beach being closed and its tourists evacuated, after spillage reached the beach. On 4 August 2013 media said that the crude oil spill had occurred  off of Thailand's mainland, \"when a floating hose transferring oil from a tanker to a PTT refinery pipeline broke sending, PTT says,  of oil spewing into the coastal waters\". Two beaches have been closed due to uncertainty about water toxicity. Ko Samet is a popular tourist island, not far from Bangkok,  off the coast of Ban Phe', Rayong. Concerns have been growing about the oil spill and the inconsistent information released.\n\nKo Samet is close to Rayong and Map Ta Phut, and they have had a long history of environmental problems since they opened in 1990. About 25,000 people live in the Map Ta Phut municipality. In 1997, the pollution came to public attention when 1,000 pupils and teachers at a local school suffered from illnesses after inhaling toxic emissions and had to be hospitalized. An independent test carried out in 2005 demonstrated that airborne cancerous toxic chemicals released by Map Ta Phut Industrial Estate exceeded safety standards of developed nations by 60 to 3,000 times.\n\nThe oil spill is in part connected to the oil operations at Map Ta Phut. Anthony Zola, an American environmental consultant is reported to have said \"In rural areas, there is almost no enforcement at all. Water pollution, air pollution, noise pollution\u2014you can make all the complaints you want, and no one pays any attention to you.\" Map Ta Phut was closed down in 2009 by the previous Prime Minister, Abhisit Vejjaijiva due to safety concerns. The New York Times reported \"Even among critics of the court decisions, there is widespread agreement that Map Ta Phut is heavily polluted and unhealthy for those who live nearby. But environmental experts remain skeptical that the court decisions will fix the problem.\"\n\nTwo days after the oil spill was discovered, PTT closed their War Room down according to Bangkok Post, and they have consistently since then tried to play down the effects of the spill. A week later they were saying it was safe to go to the beach and that it was clean. Greenpeace is concerned with the use of dispersants and the oil has sunk to the bottom and the full effects of the spill have yet to be understood. Mercury levels have also been reported to be 21 times safe limits. The dispersants also have negative effects and can cause cancers, kidney and liver problems. Some people swimming in the sea have reported dizziness. Bangkok Post reported \"In 2012, a study found that Corexit increases the toxicity of oil by 52 times. It can remain in the ecological food chain for many years and cause widespread and long-lasting health impacts.\"\n\nEstimates \nOfficial reports said  of oil were spilled, but critics of the oil company and the government say that the spill was much larger and warned of health risks posed both by the spill and by the chemicals being used to disperse the oil.\n\nA higher estimate of the oil spill has been performed by Somporn Chuai-aree of Prince Songkhla University: \"as low as  or as high as \". This estimate is believed by associate professor Siwat Pongniumchan from the National Institute of Development Administration (Nida), who disbelieves previous estimates.\n\nEffects \nTourism operators and officials were concerned about the effects on tourism in the area, as beaches in Rayong and on the nearby resort island of Ko Samet were impacted.\n\nA 14 August 2013 Bangkok Post article said that \"Fishery Department director-general Wimol Jantrarotai said Chulalongkorn University lab tests on seafood found metal contamination in samples from fish markets near Koh Samet.\"\n\nThe oil company's information sheet given to media (on the beach) on 31 July, said that the oil dispersant used is \"Slickgone NS\".\n\nOn 30 July 2013 Bangkok Post said that \"authorities and more than 500 PTT employees have been struggling to prevent the slick spreading at the beach. They have tried to contain the spill, which has stretched almost  along the bay, using containment booms to prevent further environmental damage in the area.\"\n\nA 14 August 2013 Bangkok Post article said that \"mercury levels found in sea water off Ao Phrao beach on Koh Samet were 29 times higher than safety standards allow, according to the Pollution Control Department. Furthermore \"Niphon Phungsuwan, a marine expert from the Department of Marine and Coastal Resources, said more than 70% of coral at Ao Phrao had been bleached.\"\n\nBangkok Post reports \"PTTGC has remained silent about what chemicals it is using but also said they could pose a hazard to the environment and people's health.\" In 2012, a study found that Corexit increases the toxicity of oil by 52 times. It can remain in the ecological food chain for many years and cause widespread and long-lasting health impacts. \"The use of dispersants is a solution that creates new and worse problems,\" Ms Arpa said. The main ingredients of Corexit include 2-Butoxyethanol which can comprise up to 60% of the dispersant and is known to harm the blood, kidneys, liver and central nervous system. Some people swimming near Ko Samet have reported dizziness, and two beaches have been closed. Swimming is not recommended until more is known and the full environmental impacts have been independently verified. As of 20 August 2013, tourists are recommended to use caution if and when going swimming in the water, and to be careful of seafood for now.

The oil spill was discovered at 7:30 am, and PTTGC immediately mobilized its emergency response teams to contain the spill. Despite their efforts, the oil soon spread over a vast area, covering more than 20 kilometers of coastline in Rayong and Chonburi provinces. Many fishermen were affected, as the oil destroyed their fishing grounds and caused a significant loss of marine life. The local population was also adversely affected, since the oil-contaminated water and air posed serious health hazards. In addition to environmental damage and health risks, the spill also had negative economic impacts. It affected tourism and fishing industries in the area, and PTTGC had to pay compensation to affected local communities. The company was later fined by Thailand's Pollution Control Department for environmental damage caused by the oil spill. PTTGC also faced criticism for their slow response to the spill and their lack of transparency in disclosing information about what happened. The spill raised many questions about the safety of pipelines and the need for stricter regulations to prevent such incidents from happening again in the future. In the aftermath of the incident, PTTGC took several measures to prevent further spills, such as improving their pipeline inspection procedures and installing more monitoring systems. The Thai government also reviewed their regulations for oil pipelines to ensure greater safety and accountability.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Hansard\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Hansard is the traditional name of the transcripts of Parliamentary debates in Britain and many Commonwealth countries. It is named after Thomas Curson Hansard (1776\u20131833), a London printer and publisher, who was the first official printer to the Parliament at Westminster.\n\nOrigins\nThough the history of the Hansard began in the British parliament, each of Britain's colonies developed a separate and distinctive history. Before 1771, the British Parliament had long been a highly secretive body. The official record of the actions of the House was publicly available, but there was no record of the debates. The publication of remarks made in the House became a breach of Parliamentary privilege, punishable by the two Houses of Parliament. As the populace became interested in parliamentary debates, more independent newspapers began publishing unofficial accounts of them.\n\nThe many penalties implemented by the government, including fines, dismissal, imprisonment, and investigations, are reflective of \"the difficulties faced by independent newspapermen who took an interest in the development of Upper Canada, and who, in varying degrees, attempted to educate the populace to the shortcomings of their rulers\".\n\nSeveral editors used the device of veiling parliamentary debates as debates of fictitious societies or bodies. The names under which parliamentary debates were published include Proceedings of the Lower Room of the Robin Hood Society and Debates of the Senate of Magna Lilliputia. The Senate of Magna Lilliputia was printed in Edward Cave's The Gentleman's Magazine, which was first published in 1732. The names of the speakers were carefully \"filleted\"; for example, Sir Robert Walpole was thinly disguised as \"Sr. R\u2015t W\u2015le\".\n\nIn 1771 Brass Crosby, who was Lord Mayor of the City of London, had brought before him a printer by the name of John Miller who dared publish reports of Parliamentary proceedings. He released the man, but was subsequently ordered to appear before the House to explain his actions. Crosby was committed to the Tower of London, but when he was brought to trial, several judges refused to hear the case and after protests from the public, Crosby was released. Parliament ceased to punish the publishing of its debates as harshly, partly due to the campaigns of John Wilkes on behalf of free speech. There then began several attempts to publish reports of debates. Among the early successes, the Parliamentary Register published by John Almon and John Debrett began in 1775 and ran until 1813.\n\nWilliam Cobbett (1763\u20131835), a noted radical and publisher, began publishing Parliamentary Debates as a supplement to his Political Register in 1802, eventually extending his reach back with the Parliamentary History. Cobbett's avocation for the freedom of the press was severely punished by the British Government. On 5 June 1810 William Cobbett stood trial for seditious libel for an article he wrote against the British Government which was published by Thomas Curson Hansard. Cobbett was found \"guilty, upon the fullest and most satisfactory evidence\". The court sentence read: \"The court do adjudge that you, William Cobbett pay to our Lord the King a fine of \u00a31000; that you be imprisoned in His Majesty's gaol of Newgate for the space of two years, and that at expiration of that time you enter into a recognizance to keep the peace for seven years\u2014yourself in the sum of \u00a33000, and two good and sufficient sureties in the sum of \u00a31000; and further, that you be imprisoned till that recognizance be entered into, and that fine paid\". The sentence was described by J. C. Trewin as \"vindictive\". The Court argued that Thomas Curson Hansard, who had \"seen the copy before it was printed, ought not to have suffered it to have been printed at all\" and was sentenced to three months imprisonment in the King's Bench Prison.\n\nCobbett's reports were printed by Thomas Curson Hansard from 1809; in 1812, Cobbett's finances ran asunder and he divested himself of his proprietorship of both the Parliamentary Debates and Parliamentary History, which then \"passed into the hands of Hansard in 1812\". Cobbett's Parliamentary Debates became Hansard Parliamentary Debates, \"abbreviated over time to the now familiar Hansard\". From 1829 the name \"Hansard\" appeared on the title page of each issue. Neither Cobbett nor Hansard ever employed anyone to take down notes of the debates, which were taken from a multiplicity of sources in the morning newspapers. For this reason, early editions of Hansard are not to be absolutely relied upon as a guide to everything discussed in Parliament.\n\nHansard outlasted competitors including Almon and Debrett, and the later Mirror of Parliament published by J. H. Barrow from 1828 to 1843; Barrow's work was more comprehensive but he checked each speech with the Member and allowed them to \"correct\" anything they wished they had not said. The last attempt at a commercial rival was The Times which published debates in the 1880s. In 1878 a subsidy was granted to the Hansard press and at that point reporters were employed. Despite hiring contract reporters there were still widespread complaints about the accuracy of the debate reports. In 1889 Henry Hansard, the son of Thomas Hansard, broke the family connection with the debates.\n\nIn the United Kingdom\nThe Hansard of today, a comprehensive account of every speech, began in 1909 when Parliament took over the publication and established its own staff of official Hansard reporters. At the same time the decision was made to publish debates of the two houses in separate volumes, and to change the front cover from orange-red to light blue. A larger page format was introduced with new technology in 1980.\n\nHansard is not a word-for-word transcript of debates in Parliament. Its terms of reference are those set by a House of Commons select committee in 1893, as being a report which, though not strictly verbatim, is substantially the verbatim report with repetitions and redundancies omitted and with obvious mistakes (including grammatical mistakes) corrected, but which, on the other hand, leaves out nothing that adds to the meaning of the speech or illustrates the argument.\n\nOne instance of such an eliminated redundancy involves the calling of MPs to speak in the House of Commons. In that house, the Speaker must call on an MP by name before that member may speak, but Hansard makes no mention of the recognition accorded by the Speaker. Also, Hansard sometimes adds extraneous material to make the remarks less ambiguous. For example, though members refer to each other as \"the hon. Member for Constituency Name rather than by name, Hansard adds, in parentheses, the name of the MP being referred to, the first time that MP is referred to in a speech or debate. When an MP simply points at another whose constituency he or she cannot remember, Hansard identifies him or her.\n\nAny interruption to debate will be marked with the word \"(Interruption)\". This understated phrase covers a variety of situations, ranging from members laughing uproariously to the physical invasion of the chamber. Interjections from seated members, such as heckling during Prime Minister's Questions, are generally only included if the member who is speaking responds to the interjection.\n\nHansard also publishes written answers \u2013 known as written ministerial statements \u2013 made by government ministers in response to questions formally posed by members. In 1839, Hansard, by order of the House of Commons, printed and published a report stating that an indecent book published by a Mr. Stockdale was circulating in Newgate Prison. Stockdale sued for defamation but Hansard's defence, that the statement was true, succeeded. On publication of a reprint, Stockdale sued again but Hansard was ordered by the House to plead that he had acted under order of the Commons and was protected by parliamentary privilege. In the resulting case of Stockdale v Hansard, the court found that the house held no privilege to order publication of defamatory material. In consequence, Parliament passed the Parliamentary Papers Act 1840 to establish privilege for publications under the house's authority.\n\nSince 1909\u2014and for important votes before then\u2014Hansard has listed how members have voted in divisions. Furthermore, the proceedings and debates in committee are also published in separate volumes. For many years the House of Commons Hansard did not formally acknowledge the existence of parties in the House, except obliquely, with MPs' references to other MPs of the same party as \"hon. Friends\", but in 2003 this changed and members' party affiliations are now identified. The Hansard of the House of Lords operates entirely independently of its Commons counterpart, but with similar terms of reference. It covers parliamentary business in the House of Lords chamber itself, as well as the debates in the Moses Room, known as Grand Committee. Parliamentary written answers and statements are also printed. Emma Crewe notes that \"Editors view reporters in general as a hive of revolution and anti-establishment attitudes, while they perceive themselves as calm and uncomplaining\". The Internet, with the help of volunteers, has made the UK Hansard more accessible. The UK Hansard is currently being digitised to a high-level format for on-line publication. It is possible to review and search the UK Hansard from 1803, with the exception of standing committees.\n\nBecause Hansard is treated as accurate, there is a parliamentary convention whereby if a member of Parliament makes an inaccurate statement in Parliament, they must write a correction in the copy of Hansard kept in the House of Commons library.\n\nIn 2010 historic copies of Hansard were sent to India in its original volume format and was transformed from the original bound versions into plain text by optical character recognition (OCR) and put on the Internet to enable easy research. In July 2018 this digitised Hansard was vastly improved and merged with the rest of Hansard as previously it was available under two websites and now it is a single website. There are still many 'typos' from the OCR process but readers are encouraged to report them when they are spotted.\n\nCanada\n\nHouse of Commons\nAs with the Westminster Hansard, the Canadian version is not strictly verbatim, and is guided by the principle of avoiding \"repetitions, redundancies and obvious errors\". Unlike the UK House of Commons, members are referred to in the House only by the parliamentary ridings they represent (\"The member for Richmond Hill\", etc.) or by their cabinet post. Hansard supplies an affiliation the first time each member speaks in the House on a particular day\u2014\"Mr. Mathieu Ravignat (Pontiac, NDP)\" or \"Hon. Lynne Yelich (Minister of State for Western Economic Diversification, CPC)\"\u2014and by name only when they rise later to speak.\n\nIf interjections give rise to a call for order by the Speaker, they are reported as \"Some hon. members: Oh, oh!\" The details of the approval or negativing of motions and bills are reported in rather baroque detail:\n\nTranslation\nGiven the bilingual nature of the Canadian federal government, two equivalent Canadian Hansards are maintained, one in French and one in English. This makes it a natural parallel text, and it is often used to train French\u2013English machine translation programs. In addition to being already translated and aligned, the size of the Hansards and the fact that new material is always being added makes it an attractive corpus. However, its usefulness is hindered by the fact that the translations, although accurate in meaning, are not always literally exact.\n\nThe Canadian Hansard records make note of the language used by the members of parliament, so as not to misinterpret the words of the person who has the floor. If the member speaks in French, the English Hansard records would state that the member spoke in French and refer the reader to the French Hansard record.\n\nIn one instance, during a Liberal filibuster in the Senate of Canada, Senator Philippe Gigant\u00e8s was accused of reading one of his books only so that he could get the translation for free through the Hansard.\n\nNewfoundland\nIn Newfoundland the struggle for the free press was much more violent. Henry Winton, editor of Saint John's Ledger, \"had his ears cut off and was left unconscious by thugs who had been lying in wait for him after dark\". The fate of Winton was to be his printer's as well. \nThe Authorities, who were not on friendly terms with the Ledger, made little to no effort to apprehend the culprits. In another case, a \"Gentleman by the name Parsons\", of the Newfoundland Patriot, \"was sentenced to three months imprisonment in another incident\".\n\nNova Scotia\nAs was the case in many early Canadian regions, the newspapers were the first source of the Parliamentary debates. Canada's first newspaper, the Halifax Gazette, was printed on Grafton street in Halifax in 1752. The two most prominent papers in Parliamentary reporting were the Acadian Recorder, founded in 1813 by Anthony Henry Holland, and the Free Press, established in 1816 by Edward Ward. Both newspapers reported the debates of the House of Assembly starting in 1817.\n\nThe Family Compact of Nova Scotia, nicknamed \"the little compact\", \"viewed the admission of reporters to the Assembly with disdain\" and \"were not slow to react whenever they felt the slightest affront\". There are many cases which exemplify the \"struggle to obtain freedom of the press and parliamentary reportings in the Maritimes\" as in the case of William Minns in 1823, who was forced to appear before the bar of the house, and William Milne, who was jailed for not being able to pay his debts.\n\nThe Novascotian newspaper would soon become Nova Scotia's most prominent paper after its launch in 1824, which was highly influenced by George Young who was instrumental in its establishment. George Young sought permission from the Assembly to report its debates. Permission was granted, yet he was not provided with very many privileges in the House. They didn't make it easy for him and didn't allow him a seat in the lower deck.\n\nIn 1827 Joseph Howe bought the Novascotian from Young. \"There was no more powerful an advocate of parliamentary debates than Howe\". In 1835 Joseph Howe was \"prosecuted over a publication of a letter in the Novascotian\". He was charged with libel. This case was infamous and is considered to be a \"cornerstone in the establishment of freedom of the press in Canada\". Howe, who defended himself in court, was found to be Not Guilty. This is why his case is viewed as a milestone in the development of the free press.\n\nOntario\n\nNo official record of the debates in the provincial Legislature was produced before 1944. The debates were reported in various newspapers; the provincial archives clipped and collected these reports in a series of scrapbooks until 1953. The provincial website now posts Hansard online, with records from March 29, 1977, to current.\n\nAlberta\nAlberta adopted a Hansard in 1972. From 1905 to 1971, local newspapers reported on legislative proceedings, and from these articles the Legislature Library has compiled a Scrapbook Hansard, which is available online. News reporters were allowed to take handwritten notes in the Chamber, but they could not make sound recordings, and members of the public were not allowed to take notes.\n\nIn 1965 a recording system was installed in the Chamber. Initially the Clerk's office provided transcription only for special events, such as throne speeches, but requests from MLAs for transcripts increased, and by 1971 all House proceedings were being recorded. On March 8, 1972, the government introduced a motion to create Alberta Hansard, and the following day they brought forward a motion allowing audio and video recording in the Chamber and also permitting visitors to the galleries to take notes. Assembly standing orders 115 and 116 set out the rules for broadcast media in the Chamber and at committee meetings, respectively.\n\nHansard staff verifies the names of individuals and entities mentioned in the House. Like other Hansards, Alberta Hansard follows editorial guidelines established in the 19th century, and transcripts are substantially verbatim. Revisions are limited to \"the correction of grammar, spelling and punctuation, ensuring that the correct parliamentary forms are observed, and minimizing superfluous repetition and redundancies, but no material alterations shall be made, nor any amendments that would in any way tend to change the sense of what has been spoken.\"\n\nTranscripts for Legislative Assembly of Alberta proceedings from 1972 onward are available online, and current issues are usually posted within 12 hours of the day's sitting. A transcript for a regular afternoon Assembly sitting of 4.5 hours contains more than 30,000 words. Also available online are transcripts for meetings of committees of the Legislative Assembly from the 1990s onward, earlier for some committees.\n\nBritish Columbia\n\nNo complete official record of the debates in the British Columbia Legislature was produced until 1972; a partial record was issued beginning in 1970. Unlike the Ottawa Hansard, opposition members and government backbenchers are identified only by initial and last name: \"A. Wilkinson\". Current cabinet ministers have their names prefaced with \"Honourable\": \"Hon. S. Hagen\". Interjections giving rise to a call for order by the Speaker are reported only as \"Interjection\". Other interjections are reported as spoken if they are clearly audible and if they are responded to in some way by the member who has the floor. While the details of approval or negativing of motions and bills closely parallel the House of Commons, the reporting is simplified to a style line (\"Motion approved\" or \"Motion negatived\").\n\nAustralia\nThe Parliament of Australia also keeps record of debates, using the term Hansard. The records are published by the State Law Publisher. The Parliament of South Australia was the first convict free Australian colony to use Hansard; where it became a convention from 1857.  The Parliament of Victoria followed the lead of South Australia by introducing the use of Hansard in 1866. The Parliament of New South Wales commenced its Hansard system on 28 October 1879 with the reporting of the Legislative Council at the opening of the Third Session of the Ninth Parliament.\n\nNew Zealand\n\nOn 9 July 1867 a team of five reporters, led by Chief Reporter C.C.N. Barron, produced the first official report of debates of the New Zealand Parliament. Ever since that day official transcripts of members' speeches in the New Zealand House of Representatives have been continuously published.\n\nToday the New Zealand Hansard is produced by a team of 17 FTE Hansard Editors within the Office of the Clerk of the House of Representatives. Hansard is published on the New Zealand Parliament website each day the House sits, and later indexed bound volumes are produced.\n\nSpeeches are transcribed directly from digital recordings of the debate, with staff present in the debating chamber to monitor the debate by recording the sequence of speakers and any interjections. Interjections are reported only if the member speaking replies to them or remarks on them during the course of his or her speech. Hansard Editors follow strict rules on what changes they can make to the words members use in the chamber. Hansard is as close to verbatim as possible, although Hansard Editors remove repetitions and redundancies and make minor grammatical corrections. Members are provided draft copies of their speeches at the same time that the speeches are first published on the Parliament website. Members can request correction of inadvertent factual inaccuracies but they are unable to significantly change what they said in the House.\n\nList of assemblies using the system\n\n Parliament of the United Kingdom and the UK's devolved institutions\n Parliament of Canada and the Canadian provincial and territorial legislatures\n Parliament of Australia and the Australian state and territory parliaments\n Parliament of South Africa and South Africa's provincial legislatures\n Parliament of Barbados\n East African Legislative Assembly\n New Zealand Parliament\n Legislative Council of Hong Kong\n Parliament of Malaysia and the Malaysian state legislatures\n National Parliament of Papua New Guinea\n Parliament of Singapore\n Legislative Council of Brunei\n Parliament of Sri Lanka\n Parliament of Trinidad and Tobago\n National Assembly of Kenya\n National Assembly of Tanzania\n Parliament of Ghana\n Parliament of Uganda\n Parliament of Mauritius\n Parliament of Jamaica\n National Assembly of Seychelles\n States of Jersey\n States of Guernsey\n Tynwald, the Parliament of the Isle of Man\n National Assembly of Nigeria\n National Assembly of Namibia\n Parliament of Botswana\n Parliament of Zimbabwe\n\nSee also\n List of British colonial gazettes\n Congressional Record, the equivalent for the United States\n Court reporter\n Fuddle duddle\n Hansard Society\n Pepper v Hart\n TheyWorkForYou\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n \n Hansard from 1803 to 2005\n The records of the House of Lords Official Report (Hansard) are held by the UK Parliamentary Archives\n The records of the Parliamentary Register, 1743-1786 are held by the UK Parliamentary Archives\n Parliamentary Archives, Hansard Publications and Papers\n\nTranscripts of legislative proceedings\nWestminster system", "machine_text": "Hansard is the official record of parliamentary debates in Westminster, London, and also in other parliamentary assemblies in the United Kingdom, as well as several other Commonwealth countries such as Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. The word \"Hansard\" derives from the surname of Thomas Curson Hansard, a London printer who was the first official printer to the House of Commons in 1803. The full title of the publication is \"Hansard's Parliamentary Debates,\" and it is published in both print and digital formats. The printed version is still widely used by parliamentarians and journalists, while the digital version provides easy access to debates dating back to the early 19th century. Hansard is an essential tool for any researcher studying the history of British politics and legislation. As well as recording debates in the House of Commons and the House of Lords, it also contains other important parliamentary documents, including reports from select committees, written answers to parliamentary questions, and record of divisions- when votes are taken- in Parliament. Hansard is also a vital resource for anyone seeking to understand the workings of Parliament in current times. The debates and proceedings are recorded verbatim and provide a wealth of information to researchers and interested parties on the views, attitudes, and ideas of Members of Parliament. There are currently around 25 people employed in the Hansard team within Parliament, committed to producing an accurate and impartial record of Parliamentary proceedings. As well as the publication of the printed volumes and digital versions of Hansard, the team also provides a live feed of parliamentary debates on the Parliament TV website, ensuring that parliamentary proceedings are accessible to anyone with an internet connection. In conclusion, Hansard is an essential resource for researchers, journalists, and anyone wishing to understand the history and workings of British parliamentary democracy. Its publication, in both print and digital forms, ensures that debates are recorded for posterity and are accessible to future generations.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 102326}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"The Art Genome Project\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Art Genome Project is the search technology behind Artsy.\n\nThe Art Genome Project's search technology is the product of an ongoing art-historical study\u2014undertaken by a team of contributors with art-historical backgrounds at Artsy\u2014seeking to define the characteristics which distinguish and connect works of art, architecture, ancient artifacts and design.\n\nIts primary aim is to provide Artsy users dynamic search categories and explain similarities among art and artists. Currently, there are 1000+ \"genes\" (i.e. attributes of art) in the project's taxonomy, including art-historical movements, subject matter, and formal qualities. These genes are the product of Artsy's team and their engagement with (and feedback from) the museums, galleries, curators, critics and art historians present on Artsy's platform.\n\nThere are two general parts of the project: 1) Conceiving and defining such characteristics, referred to as \"genes,\" and 2) Applying these genes to artists and artworks\u2014creating \"genomes\" for both\u2014for the artsy.net site.\n\nImportantly, unlike tags, which are binary, genes are applied with values ranging from 0 to 100. The value indicates the degree of relevance of a gene to an artist or work of art. While not seen by users, such gene values account for the strength of a relationship between artists and artworks. It also enables similarity to be expressed in a more nuanced way< than it might be with just tags because one can weigh various attributes of an artist or work of art to establish which might be the most or less important. Furthermore, such nuance allows for matching potential collectors with artworks based on their tastes and preferences.\n\nArtsy's \"genes\" create various opportunities for discovering and learning about the artist and artworks. If users search for an artist, they can see \"related\" artists and if they search for an artwork, they can see \"related\" artworks. Genes (with definitions) also appear on their own pages and provide the backbone for Artsy's Browse page.\n\nThe Art Genome Project provides metadata for search (and similarity) results based on the principles of information retrieval (TF/IDF) and presents results in a UX-driven search product.\n\nMatthew Israel, an art historian, is the Director of The Art Genome Project.\n\nPrecedents for The Art Genome Project \n\nThe Art Genome Project has often been compared to Pandora's Music Genome Project, and was originally developed in consultation with Pandora's Joe Kennedy. Both aim to create comprehensive (though by no means exhaustive) analyses of types of art by identifying a set of criteria, which both call \"genes\". These are both broadly applicable to their respective art forms, as well as useful for generating interesting connections for users. Importantly, while The Art Genome is currently one extensive list of genes for all works of art, Pandora has separate genomes (lists of genes) for each genre of music.\n\nThe Music Genome Project and TAGP are examples of Big Data, which is a sector of algorithmic technology that synthesizes data to predict what users will prefer. Artsy's genome is user facing, allowing users to navigate genes manually. Netflix also makes customized recommendations to users based on the qualities of the movies that they enjoy. Amazon Art makes suggestions to users based on their browsing and purchasing history.\n\nMuseums and galleries as well as other online art image databases, such as Google Art Project and Artstor, digitize artworks for public access, but beyond providing basic metadata (artist, title, date, medium) these databases do not extensively classify works of art or create connections between them.\n\nThe Art Genome Project and Other Taxonomies for Artwork \n\nArt historians, libraries and image archives have long used classification systems, art cataloging standards or metadata, and created taxonomies, such as The Getty Art & Architecture Thesaurus to systematize the description of artworks. Classification is one of the major foundations of the discipline of art history.\n\nMost college and university art history surveys are based on such an idea of classification, to provide students with a way of grasping the history of art and a jumping-off point for more focused research. Unlike other types of classification, The Art Genome's taxonomy was designed for the purposes of establishing similarities between artists and artworks.\n\nGenes versus Tags \n\nIn the words of Matthew Israel, Director of The Art Genome Project, \"Genes are not tags \u2014 though we have many tags on the site \u2014 because tags are binary (something is either tagged \"dog\" or not). Genes, in contrast, can range from 0-100, thus capturing how strongly a gene applies to a specific artist or artwork. This nuanced connection between works of art is impossible with a simple tagging mechanism.\"\n\nImportantly, The Art Genome Project does incorporate over 6000 tags for content (iconography) in artwork as well as certain materials and mediums, which do not need the nuance of genes.\n\nReception\n\nPositive Reception \nDigtalmeetsculture.net calls TAGP \"user-friendly,\" \"intelligent and orchestrated behind the scenes by the Artsy experts.\" Complex.com highlighted genes in their article \"15 Awesome Genes on Artsy\"  to show \"just how incredible their project is.\"\n\nIn the New York Times, the Cooper-Hewitt Museum's director of new and emerging media Seb Chan said, \"sites like Art.sy were not meant to replace museums, galleries or books, but rather to help the public, especially art neophytes, stretch the boundaries of their taste. \u2018You shouldn\u2019t need to be a scholar to discover works of art that you might be fascinated by,\u2019 he said. \u2018You go to museums and you browse \u2014 chancing upon things is what it\u2019s all about. The Art Genome is another way of creating serendipitous connections.\u2019\"\n\nJonathan Olivares praised The Art Genome\u2019s comprehensiveness, objectivity and ability to accommodate future revisions: \"Unlike books, which can only be modified between editions, the website is made of millions of layers of edits that can be reworked at any time\u2026 [and] [u]nlike the opinionated and subjectively ordered history book, this neutral and re-configurable database will allow us to access any work of art or design, within any imaginable order, and instantly.\"\n\nCriticism \nCriticism around The Art Genome Project centers on \"its classification system, which rubs some artists the wrong way.\"\n\nSome critics have questioned the accuracy of the connections made through genes: \"'I don't think what I am doing has anything to do with Cindy Sherman,' says British artist Jonathan Smith after being told the site links his work to hers via a staged-photography gene. 'That sounds like something a programmer would think of.\" Others have highlighted the subjective nature of genes and expressed a concern that they might be applied reductively.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n The Art Genome Project\n\nArts databases", "machine_text": "The Art Genome Project is an online resource developed by Artsy, an art platform that connects collectors, curators, and art enthusiasts with a vast global network of galleries and sellers. Launched in 2010, the project is a comprehensive and interactive database of art that aims to provide users with an in-depth understanding of artworks, as well as help them discover new artists and artworks that resonate with their interests and preferences. The project consists of an algorithm that analyzes and categorizes works of art based on various parameters, including subject matter, style, medium, artistic movement, and historical context. The algorithm uses a machine learning approach to identify patterns and connections between artworks, enabling it to provide personalized recommendations to users based on their previous searches and activity on the platform. The Art Genome Project currently features over 1.3 million works of art from around the world, ranging from ancient artifacts to contemporary installations. It also includes detailed information about artists and their careers, such as biographies, exhibition histories, and critical reviews. One of the key features of the project is the ability to search for artworks based on specific attributes, such as color, texture, or composition. This allows users to fine-tune their searches and discover artworks that have a particular visual appeal. The Art Genome Project has been praised for its contribution to art education and curation. By providing a comprehensive database of art and contextual information, it helps users develop a deeper understanding of art and its place in history and culture. It also provides a valuable resource for art professionals, allowing them to easily research and compare artists and artworks.

It is native to several countries in southern South America. This woodsorrel is typically grown as a houseplant but can be grown outside in USDA climate zones 8a\u201311, preferably in light shade.\n\nThe deep maroon leaves are trifoliate, like species in the clover genus Trifolium which are commonly called shamrock, hence the name \u201cfalse shamrock\u201d. An interesting feature is that the leaves close like an umbrella at night (See the timelapse video below) or when disturbed or if kept under harsh sunlight. The white or pale pink five-petalled flowers also close at night.\n\nDescription\nGrowing to  tall and broad, the subspecies O. triangularis subsp. papilionacea, the purpleleaf false shamrock, is hardy in mild and coastal areas of Britain, down to , and has won the Royal Horticultural Society\u2019s Award of Garden Merit. It is a perennial plant without aerial stem, formed by leaves borne by a long petiole emerging at the ground level of a tuberous rhizome (5 cm long, over 10 - 15  mm in diameter, fully covered with scales). The leaf is formed of three sessile leaflets, obtriangular to obovate-triangular, glabrous, arranged in the same plane perpendicular to the petiole.\n\nThe five densely haired sepals are 5 to 5.5 mm long, narrow and slightly reddish at the top. The five white petals are about 2 inches long and oblong-lanceolate. The stamens and the style are densely hairy. The limb of the wild species is green but purple cultivars have been selected for horticulture. The petiole, soft, whitish, is 15 to 25 cm long. Flowering takes place from spring to autumn.\n\nMovement\n\nThe leaves of O. triangularis move in response to light levels, opening in high ambient light (in the day) and closing at low light levels (at night). During this movement, the leaflets fold at the level of the central vein. This movement is not due to growth and is instead powered by changes in turgor pressure in cells at the base of the leaf. It is an example of photonasty.\n\nRange\nThe species is distributed in several countries of South America: Brazil, Bolivia, Argentina and Paraguay. It is a neophyte in the United States in the states of Florida and Louisiana. It is also widely found in East India abundantly in states like Nagaland and Manipur.\n\nCultivation and life cycle\n\nO. triangularis requires bright indirect sunlight supplemented with a cool indoor temperature of . It can tolerate higher indoor temperatures but will go into dormancy prematurely and/or begin to take on a \"tired\" appearance if temperatures exceed  for prolonged periods of time. It thrives in an average potting soil with good drainage.\n\nMature plants are cut back to the soil every 3\u20135 years in early summer or during the dormancy period.  Young plants are cut back to the soil every year in early summer or during the dormancy period, until they reach maturity. Fearing frost, they are usually grown indoors. They are planted in soil rich in humus and well drained. They should be watered only when the topsoil looks dry. In winter, they should not be watered.\n\nThe subspecies Oxalis triangularis subsp papilionacea has won the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.\n\nUsage\nThe leaves are eaten raw or cooked and have an acidic taste due to their oxalic acid content. Leaves and flowers can be used as a decoration for salads. When consuming larger amounts of leaves, the oxalic acid can cause discomfort. The rhizomes are eaten raw or cooked and have a sweet taste.\n\nPropagation\nOxalis triangularis grows from corms, propagated by division. Like other corms, it goes through regular dormancy periods; at the end of each period, the corms can be unearthed, offsets cut and replanted in appropriate soil, where they will grow into new plants.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n2007 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (for conservation status)\nZimmerman, Maureen Williams.

Commonly referred to as the Purple Shamrock, it is native to Brazil, but is widely cultivated as an ornamental plant in many parts of the world. The plant gets its name from the triangle-shaped leaves that grow in groups of three. The Purple Shamrock typically grows to a height of8-10 inches and has a spread of 6-8 inches in width. It produces delicate pink flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. The plant is a perennial, meaning that it lives for more than two years, and it can thrive even in partial shade conditions. This plant is low-maintenance and easy to grow. It prefers well-drained soil and requires moderate watering. While it can tolerate dry conditions, it is best to keep it moist to prevent the leaves from wilting. The plant requires feeding occasionally, and this can be done with a balanced fertilizer. The Purple Shamrock is known for its unique characteristics, such as its ability to fold its leaves at night and open them in the morning. It also has a natural circadian rhythm, and its leaves open and close depending on the amount of sunlight it receives. The plant has several medicinal properties and has been traditionally used to treat various ailments such as indigestion, inflammation, and skin problems. It contains oxalic acid, which gives it a sour taste and makes it unpalatable to some animals. In summary, Oxalis triangularis is a beautiful and easy-to-care-for plant that can make a lovely addition to any garden or indoor space. With its unique characteristics and rich history, it is no wonder that this plant has become a popular choice for gardeners and plant enthusiasts alike.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 16161772}

It also peaked at number two on the Swedish singles chart, number four in Belgium, number seven in Austria and Germany, and number nine in Finland and Spain.

It got released in September, exactly a year apart from the original release, and went to number eleven on the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart.\n\nCritical reception\nAndy Kastanas from The Charlotte Observer deemed it \"another good song that deserves a listen\". He added, \"This is much more downbeat than their earlier stuff, with easier vocals and a sound reminiscent of old Imagination or Enigma.\" Pan-European magazine Music & Media called it \"slow disco\". A reviewer from Newcastle Evening Chronicle wrote that it's \"mesmerising\".\n\nChart performance\n\"Obsession\" was successful on the charts in Europe.

Dr. Darren Lund made a complaint about the letter to the Alberta Human Rights and Citizenship Commission. In 2008, a human rights panel ruled that the letter was \"likely to expose homosexuals to hatred and/or contempt,\" ordering Boissoin to apologize to Lund and pay $5,000 in damages. Boissoin appealed to the Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta. In 2009, the Court of Queen's Bench overturned the Panel's ruling. In 2012, the Court of Appeal of Alberta upheld the Queen's Bench decision.\n\n2002 letter to the Red Deer Advocate\nIn June 2002, Reverend Stephen Boissoin, Central Alberta Chairman of the Concerned Christian Coalition, sent a letter to the Red Deer Advocate. The letter said, \"Where homosexuality flourishes, all manner of wickedness abounds\". The letter claimed that \"Homosexual rights activists and those that defend them, are just as immoral as the pedophiles, drug dealers and pimps that plague our communities.\"\n\nThe newspaper published the letter on 17 June 2002.\n\nHuman rights complaint and litigation\n\nAlberta Human Rights Panel\nOn  18 July 2002, Dr. Darren Lund, a professor at the University of Calgary, filed a complaint against Boissoin and the Concerned Christian Coalition with the Alberta Human Rights and Citizenship Commission, alleging that Boisson's letter constituted discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, as prohibited by Alberta's Human Rights, Citizenship and Multiculturalism Act. A one-member Alberta Human Rights Panel accepted Lund's arguments that the letter was \"likely to expose homosexuals to hatred and/or contempt.\" The Canadian Civil Liberties Association intervened in the case, condemning the views expressed in the letter but arguing they should not be subject to legal sanction.\n\nOn 30 May 2008, the Alberta Human Rights Panel ordered Boissoin and the Concerned Christian Coalition to refrain from publishing future disparaging remarks about homosexuals and provide Lund with a written apology and in $5,000 damages.\n\nCourt of Queen\u2019s Bench of Alberta\nBoissoin appealed the ruling to the Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta. On 3 December 2009, the Court overturned the decision of the Alberta Human Rights Panel. The Court found that the contents of the letter did not violate the Alberta Human Rights Act, and that the remedies which had been imposed were either unlawful or unconstitutional. The Court also identified \"troubling aspects of the process leading to the decision of the Panel,\" including the inclusion of the Concerned Christian Coalition as a respondent.\n\nCourt of Appeal of Alberta\nIn March 2010, Lund appealed the Court of Queen's Bench ruling to the Court of Appeal of Alberta. In October 2012, the Court dismissed the appeal, ruling in favor of Boissoin. The Court agreed with the lower court that Boissoin\u2019s letter was \"a polemic on a matter of public interest and does not qualify as reaching the extreme limits... to expose persons to hatred or contempt,\" within the meaning of the Alberta Human Rights Act. The Court also stated that \"it is not clear that Boissoin could have phrased the same purely political opinion in any more acceptable or polite way than he chose.\"\n\nOpposition from Ezra Levant\nJournalist Ezra Levant was a fierce critic of the case and the provincial human rights commission.  He republished Rev. Boissoin's letter verbatim, resulting in a complaint against Levant. When the Alberta Human Rights Commission dismissed the resulting complaint in November 2008, Levant accused the human rights commissions of religious discrimination, asserting that \"100% of the CHRC's targets have been white, Christian or conservative\" and that \"It's legal for a Jew like me to publish [Boissoin\u2019s letter].

The case ultimately went to the Alberta Human Rights Commission, which found Boissoin guilty of promoting hatred and awarded Lund $5,000 in damages.

It was used to strike/jab an opponent in the body or the head, usually made from nephrite jade (pounamu or greenstone). A mere is one of the traditional, hand to hand, one-handed weapons of the indigenous M\u0101ori of New Zealand, and a symbol of chieftainship.\n\nForm \n\nThe mere is a spatulate, leaf shaped, form of short club.  It has a broad, rounded apex that narrows to form a handle, terminating in a butt or heel (reke), marked by several grooves.  Mere have two convex, almost flat sides and a rounded top.  The top of the mere was ground to a sharp edge, extending down both sides of the weapon.\n\nGenerally, short clubs had holes carved or drilled through the butt end of the handle, allowing a wrist cord (tau or patui) made of plaited New Zealand flax, or Polynesian dog skin, to be passed through and attached to the wielder's wrist.  Passing the wrist cord over the thumb and around the hand prevented the club from slipping during use.\n\nMere are between , with an average length of .  The width of a mere is similarly variable, from under 7 to over 12 centimetres (3 to 5\u00a0in).  The dimensions of a mere were generally determined by the characteristics of the raw materials the club was made from.  Extremely long or short mere are unwieldy in combat, and are likely to have been mainly used for ceremonial purposes.\n\nMaterial and manufacture \nWhile the term mere was, and is, used in some regions to refer exclusively to clubs made from pounamu, in other regions,  mere was more broadly used to refer to patu of a similar shape and design made from hardwood (meremere, mere rakau), whalebone (patu paraoa), or stone (patu \u014dnewa) - in these areas, a mere made from greenstone was known as a mere pounamu or patu pounamu.\n\nThe pounamu used to make a mere was carefully chosen to be flawless and to have a good colour.  A block of greenstone was first rough cut using pieces of quartzite combined with sand and water.  Dressing of the surface was done with fine sandstone and pieces of very hard smooth stone.  Due to the toughness of greenstone, mere pounamu were able to be made thinner than other similar patu made from stone, however this made the process of manufacture slow and arduous. The creation and finishing of a mere pounamu is claimed to have sometimes taken more than one generation to complete.\n\nUsage\n\nCombat \nMere, and other patu, were used for close-quarter fighting.  Held in one hand, these close-range striking weapons were used primarily for end-on thrusting or jabbing (tipi).  In combat, jabbing thrusts or strikes would be directed at the ribs, neck or temple.  It has been claimed that a strike to the skull combined with a twisting flick of the wrist could force or wrench the victim's skull open. The designed use of the mere for forward striking thrusts is an unusual characteristic of Maori patu, where in other parts of the world, clubs are generally wielded with an ax-like downward blow. The butt (reke) of a mere could also be used to strike an opponent's head.\n\nA mere pounamu was much harder than a patu of wood or bone, and much tougher - less likely to fracture - than a patu onawe of any other type of stone.\n\nIt was stated that a proficient warrior armed with a patu was able to defeat a man armed with a longer weapon, like a taiaha or spear.  A fighter using a patu often used a type of pad (whakapuru), held or on the off-side arm, used to parry or lessen the impact of an opposing weapon.\n\nWhen not in use mere were carried in a flax belt (t\u0101tua) or sometimes suspended from a wrist cord.\n\nCeremonial \nPounamu was highly prized by Maori and the mere pounamu as the weapon of a chief or rangatira, was the most revered of all Maori weapons.  These mere were passed through generations; they were given names, and were said to possess a spiritual quality or mana of their own. \nParticularly special mere were imbued with magical powers, or supernatural qualities. Due to the high value placed on revered mere pounamu they would often be hidden when not in use, and kept in specially constructed cases.  Considerable efforts were undertaken, often by an entire tribe, to recover or regain significant mere that were lost or stolen. Mere were buried with their chiefly owners, but were considered so valuable that they were later recovered from the grave during the second burial. \nIt was considered an honour to be killed by a specially significant mere pounamu.  Captives would sometimes volunteer their own mere pounamu as their means of execution rather than be killed by a lesser weapon.\n\nGiving such a valuable item  was common as a sign of good faith and it retains this symbolic importance today.\n\nThe mere is shown as one of the features of the Maori Kotahitanga flag, where it is crossed with a scroll representing the Treaty of Waitangi.\n\nSee also\nKotiate\nPouwhenua\nTewhatewha\nPatu\nTaiaha\nLeiomano\nWahaika\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n \"Horokiwi\" - the mere of Te Rira P\u014drutu\n \"Hine-nui-o-te-paua\" - gifted by the Ng\u0101ti P\u0101oa  to Governor George Grey as a peace offering in 1851 \n \"Tuhiwai\" - Te Rauparaha's personal weapon.\n Extensive collection at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa\n Collection at the British Museum\n\nClubs (weapon)\nM\u0101ori weapons\nCeremonial weapons", "machine_text": "Mere (weapon) The Mere is a traditional Maori weapon that was used in close combat and hunting. It is a short wooden club that is made from a dense wood such as matai, totara, or pohutukawa. The Mere was used by the Maori people of New Zealand as a highly effective weapon in combat. It was also used as a symbol of power and prestige. The Mere was a versatile weapon that could be used in different ways. It could be used as a close combat weapon, as well as a throwing weapon. The Maori warriors would strike their enemies with a swift blow to the head, chest or arms using the Mere. The Mere was also used as a throwing weapon, similar to a short spear. It was thrown by the Maori warriors with great accuracy and force. The Mere was an important part of the Maori culture. It was often carved with intricate designs and patterns that represented the family or tribe that it belonged to. The carvings also symbolized various spiritual and historic events and legends that were important to the Maori people. In addition to its use in combat, the Mere was also used in hunting. It was used to strike animals such as pigs and dogs to kill them quickly. The Mere was highly effective in hunting because of its weight and density. Today, the Mere is still used in ceremonial events and is highly valued by the Maori people. It is a symbol of their history and culture, and is an important part of their identity. In conclusion, the Mere is a traditional Maori weapon that was used for combat and hunting. It was a versatile weapon that could be used in different ways, and was highly effective in battles and hunting.

It extended for most of the campaign period for that election, but grew especially intensive toward the actual date of the election on November 7. It marked the first appearance of John Oliver on the show.\n\nIn particular, the Indecision 2006 coverage extended to the Midwest Midterm Midtacular, which was a special of The Daily Show that aired from October 30, 2006 through November 2, 2006. It was filmed in Columbus, Ohio at Roy Bowen Theater on the campus of Ohio State University.\n\nThe Midtacular chose to film in Ohio due to that state's highly contested and critical role in the outcomes of both the midterm elections held on November 7, 2006 and in the 2004 Presidential election (another possible reason is that Ohio is located in the Midwest/middle of the United States, in keeping with the \"middle\" centric theme). Featured candidates from Ohio were the successful Ohio Governor's election candidate Ted Strickland and opponent Ken Blackwell and successful Democratic Ohio Senate election candidate Sherrod Brown who went on to defeat incumbent Republican Mike DeWine.\n\nIt was the fifth time that The Daily Show traveled outside New York City for its Indecision campaign. Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Washington, DC, and Boston (for the 2004 Democratic National Convention) have also been featured.\n\nFirst episode\nThe first episode of the special was covered from various Applebee's restaurants in Youngstown, Cincinnati, and Shaker Heights as well as a Bob Evans restaurant in Chillicothe. In addition, Samantha Bee covered a segment from Columbus\u2014filming at the Ohio Statehouse and the Columbus Hooter's. The first guest on the special was Cleveland Cavaliers star LeBron James.\n\nThe crowd showed strong vocal support for successful Democratic candidates Brown and Strickland. They booed at footage where Blackwell suggested Strickland had been a member of the North American Man/Boy Love Association and cheered when LeBron James claimed he would have attended Ohio State University had he not been able to enter the NBA at 18.\n\nSecond episode\nThe second episode featured specials on voting changes made by Ken Blackwell that restricted voting by minorities in 2004. It was said that, \"this was the first time a black man was able to disenfranchise someone in this country.\" It also featured the tight races in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Montana, and Tennessee. Also, the political commercials that have been featured across the nation were parodied. Stewart's guest was The Ohio State University political science professor John Mueller who wrote the book Overblown.\n\nMidterm Midtacular Election Day Special\nThe Midtacular culminated in a live, hour-long episode on the night of Election Day, November 7, 2006.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Rostock-Lichtenhagen riots\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "From August 22 to August 24, 1992  violent xenophobic riots took place in the Lichtenhagen district of Rostock, Germany; these were the worst mob attacks against migrants in postwar Germany. Stones and petrol bombs were thrown at an apartment block where asylum seekers lived. At the height of the riots, several hundred militant right-wing extremists were involved, and about 3,000 neighbourhood onlookers stood by, applauding them.\n\nThe initial response of authorities and politicians was heavily criticised. For some days prior to the riots, veiled warnings of impending trouble had been posted in some newspapers. Police and politicians seemed reluctant to respond, and, when they did, their responses were considered inadequate. Outside the building where the refugees were housed, several hundred asylum seekers had been camping for days with little or no access to basic facilities. This was contributing to escalating tensions in the neighbourhood.\n\nBetween 22 and 26 August 1992, there were 370 provisional arrests and 408 preliminary investigations related to the riots. Among the arrested were 110 people from former West Germany; 217 from the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, including 147 from Rostock; and another 37 from the former East Germany. During the riot, 204 police officers were injured. No one was killed.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Zentrale Aufnahmestelle f\u00fcr Asylbewerber f\u00fcr Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (ZAst M-V), or \"Central Refugee Shelter\" for the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, was in an 11-storey plattenbau apartment complex known as the \"Sunflower House\" or \"Sunflower Tower\", because of the large sunflowers decorating one side. The building was notorious for the inhumane conditions under which the asylum seekers there were living and the lack of support (if any) provided for them. The authorities had ignored  numerous complaints from citizens and residents over the filthy and deplorable conditions in the apartment building.\n\nRioting\nThe shelter was originally intended to house 300 refugees a month, but by summer 1992 it was averaging 11,500 refugees per month. Primarily Roma from Romania, they were left by overstretched shelter staff to camp out in front of the building for days at a time. The municipal government refused to provide portable toilets and there was no water or garbage collection. Clashes between the homeless migrants and the Lichtenhagen residents increased. Neither the city nor the state government took action.\n\nFor days prior to the riots, the newspapers Norddeutsche Neueste Nachrichten and Ostsee-Zeitung had been calling for a \"Lichtenhagen interest group\". There were anonymous warnings that if by the weekend, the refugee shelter was not \"cleaned up,\" order would be made. This gave young gang members from every corner of Rostock, normally enemies, a date, place and purpose to congregate. One 19-year-old skinhead said, \"The police know the Rostock Skins and 'Hools' [hooligans]. When something like this is announced, we're there!\"\n\nThe first day's riot started with young people from the neighbourhood throwing stones. This was contained by the police, but media coverage encouraged neo-Nazis to roam the area. This led to a situation where a xenophobic mob outnumbered the police by day three. The original target, the asylum accommodation, was evacuated on the second day, whereupon the mob stormed a neighbouring building in which 115 Vietnamese immigrants, a social worker and a ZDF television crew had mistakenly been left behind. While the building burned, they barricaded their doors against rioters, who were climbing over the balconies armed with baseball bats and Molotov cocktails. Below, a mob of over 3,000 spectators eagerly watched and applauded.\n\nCharges of police and political incompetence were levelled from the beginning. One explanation cited for the lack of effective action by the police was that they were reluctant to take any action which might have been reminiscent of the recently cast-off communist police state. There were also charges that police and politicians were privately sympathetic to the anti-migrant sentiment.\n\nThe first major conviction relating to the riots was on 4 March 1993, though 24 convictions on lesser charges had already been handed down. A 22-year-old man was convicted of throwing a firebomb at police, of seriously disturbing the peace, violating weapons laws and attempted bodily harm. An attempted murder charge was dropped for lack of evidence. Critics complained that no one was convicted of assaulting a foreigner, only of assaulting the police or of disorderliness. It took almost ten years to prosecute 408 people.\n\nThe following timeline was reconstructed by the \"Legislative Committee to Investigate the Refugee Shelter Incident\" (\"Parlamentarischer Untersuchungsausschuss zu den Ereignissen um die ZAst\").\n\nTimeline\n\nAugust 22, Day 1\nFrom about 6:00\u00a0p.m. a large crowd assembled in front of the refugee shelter. At 8:02\u00a0p.m., thugs started attacking the shelter and violence escalated quickly. By 10:46 p.m., police were forced to retreat from the area. At 11:02\u00a0p.m. riot police arrived on the scene and were attacked with Molotov cocktails. At 11:24\u00a0p.m. another police unit arrived from Schwerin. At 1:34\u00a0a.m. water cannons were set up and put to continuous use. Between 1:34 and 2:34\u00a0a.m., the rioters were pushed towards the autobahn. At 2:25\u00a0a.m. a water cannon vehicle was set on fire by a Molotov cocktail. At 2:30\u00a0a.m. Rostock police command declared a police emergency and the armoury was opened. Officers were issued tear gas and fired at the crowd. The situation calmed down by 5:30\u00a0a.m.\n\nDay 1 Statistics: 160 police officers, 300 rioters, 13 police officers injured, nine arrests.\n\nAugust 23, Day 2, Part 1\n\n100 people gathered in front of the shelter. At 11:15\u00a0a.m. Rostock police department requested back-up from other police departments. Squads responded from Schwerin, Anklam, Stralsund and G\u00fcstrow. The Landespolizei force of the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern sent two additional water cannons. Two reserve units (Einsatzhundertschaften) from the Federal Border Patrol (Bundesgrenzschutz) were activated. At 2:15\u00a0p.m. plainclothes officers reported the arrival of 30 known neo-Nazis in the area.\n\nAugust 23, Day 2, Part 2\n\nAt 6:45\u00a0p.m. about 400 rioters started attacking the shelter. At 7:18\u00a0p.m. the rioters started throwing Molotov cocktails. 8:00\u00a0p.m. The police used water cannons to clear the area. At 8:30\u00a0p.m. police resorted to firing live ammunition. At 10:00\u00a0p.m. the police officer in charge reported that without reinforcements, within 30 minutes, the situation would be impossible to control. At 10:30\u00a0p.m. a police car was set on fire. At 10:41\u00a0p.m. state police declared a state of emergency (Landespolizeialarm).\n\nThe state level of emergency allowed for additional federal brigades to be called in.  Hamburg sent out its SWAT (SEK and MBK) units. These riot police units of about 100 officers each were reinforced by two police dog squads from Kiel, a reserve unit from L\u00fcbeck, and helicopters from the federal police.\n\nAt 2:55\u00a0a.m. The second Hamburg unit arrived on the scene. At 3:45\u00a0a.m. the first Hamburg unit arrived. At 4:10\u00a0a.m. the situation quieted down. The Hamburg units took over the night watch.\n\nDay 2 Statistics: 850 police officers, 500 rioters, 70 police officers injured, 130 arrests.\n\nAugust 24, Day 3, Part 1\n\n2:00\u00a0p.m. Under the protection of the Hamburg units (now 16 hours in action), the shelter was evacuated. The large crowd of onlookers gave notice of a melee at 4:00\u00a0p.m. The police learned of a telephone network that hooligans were using to organize the melee, which was to attack the police exclusively if the shelter was cleared out.\n\nAugust 24, Day 3, Part 2\n\n7:45\u00a0p.m. Reinforcements from the 4th Brigade, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern arrived to replace the Hamburg riot units, now in action for 21 hours. 7:55\u00a0p.m. Ten minutes after the replacements arrived, an order was given to withdraw all protection for the shelter.\n\nAt 8:00\u00a0p.m. during the retreat from the building, Federal Border Patrol units reinforcing the second Hamburg unit came under attack. At this point, the crowd of cheering onlookers had grown to about 3,000. At 8:05\u00a0p.m. squads from the second Hamburg unit, which had already left the scene, were ordered back to reinforce the Border Patrol unit under attack. In order to push through the crowd, they resorted to using batons. The commanding officer of the first Hamburg unit reported that the threat of violence was higher than what he had seen in his five years of experience in Hamburg's rioting hotspots, Hafenstra\u00dfe and Flora.\n\nAt 8:15\u00a0p.m. The first Hamburg unit and the 4th Brigade MV reached the other units. Water cannons were used and police cordons were formed. Rail transport police were radioed for back-up. The alarm was \"Officers in distress.\" The first Hamburg unit also provided support.\n\nAt 8:40\u00a0p.m. a technical problem knocked out one water cannon. At 9:20\u00a0p.m. the retreating first Hamburg unit sought cover from the water cannon of the 4th Brigade MV. At 9:34\u00a0p.m. The water supply of the second cannon ran out. The 4th Brigade MV of about 100 men was up against 800 rioters. At 10:37\u00a0p.m. the 4th Brigade MV formed a police cordon and aimed the water cannon at the crowd to allow the fire department to get through. At 10:55\u00a0p.m. the first Hamburg unit was sent back to Hamburg after 25 hours of duty. At midnight the 4th Brigade MV began clearing out the remaining roughly 300 hooligans, while the second Hamburg unit was sent back to Hamburg after 26 hours of duty. At 12:30\u00a0a.m. the area settled down.\n\nAt 2:00\u00a0a.m. 400 hooligans again began to storm the refugee shelter, using every means possible. The police had a strong presence and up to 7 water cannons were used to clear the streets surrounding the apartment complex. About 1,000-1,200 rioters took part in the melee with the police. By 3:00\u00a0a.m., the situation was under control.\n\nDay 3 Statistics: 2050 police officers, 2000 rioters, 117 police officers injured, 58 arrests.\n\nCopycat acts\n\nIn the week after the riots in Rostock, neo-Nazis attacked 40 residences with firebombs and stones, and fought street battles with the police.  In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania in the following few days, the asylum centers in Wismar, Rostock-Hinrichshagen, L\u00fcbz, and Neubrandenburg were attacked, and there were three such incidents in Greifswald. In Wismar there was a six-day riot between 15 and 20 September in front of the asylum center, whereas in Lichtenhagen there was applause from local residents. Even after that, there were attacks almost daily. On one weekend between Friday 18 September and Sunday 20 September, asylum centers in G\u00fcstrow Ueckerm\u00fcnde Kr\u00f6pelin, Schwarzendorf (in the district of Malchin), Schwerin, Wismar, and Retschow were repeatedly attacked with Molotov cocktails.\n\nLegal proceedings\n\nThe attacks led to 370 arrests and 408 preliminary investigations. Prosecutions proved very difficult, as there was little reliable evidence. Overall, the legal process was judged to have been remarkably slow and consequences mild. \n\nCases were brought before the Regional Court of Rostock against 257 persons, most of which were dropped. Only 40 young people in 1993/94 were charged with rioting and arson. Most were given fines and suspended sentences. Eleven of those convicted were sent into youth custody ranging from seven months to three years, but only four of them were actually incarcerated between two and three years; the other seven sentences were suspended. It took ten years after the riots for the last three cases to be concluded. The sentences were for 12 to 18 months in juvenile detention, or probation, although the then 17-, 18- and 19-year-olds convicted of assault were sentenced not only for arson, but for attempted murder. The vast majority of those involved in the rioting remained anonymous and unpunished, despite the whole three days of rioting having been filmed by national German television, by the BBC, and other foreign news broadcasters.\n\nAn investigation against Rostock police chief Siegfried Kordus was discontinued in 1994. A case was made against the leader of the police operation, Chief Superintendent J\u00fcrgen Deckert for criminally negligent arson by omission, but the case was dropped in 2000.\n\nMedia\n Mark Saunders. \"The Truth Lies in Rostock (AVI, 698,7 MB)]\" (BRD, Great Britain, 78 min.) /  1993 von Mark Saunders & Siobhan Cleary - 121 min\n Wir Sind Jung.

The riots started on August 22, 1992, and continued for three consecutive days. The riots were mainly directed against foreigners and asylum seekers. It is considered one of the worst xenophobic attacks in post-war Germany and a turning point in the country's attitude towards immigration. Background: During the 1980s and early 1990s, there was a rise in the number of refugees and asylum seekers in Germany. The German government had introduced a policy of accepting asylum seekers from war-torn countries like Yugoslavia, Somalia, and Sri Lanka. The influx of refugees led to a growing sense of unease among the local population, who felt that the government was not doing enough to address their concerns. Incident: On August 22, 1992, a crowd of about 3,000 people, mainly local residents, gathered in front of a hostel for asylum seekers in the Lichtenhagen district of Rostock. The crowd demanded that the asylum seekers be sent back to their home countries. The protests quickly escalated into violent confrontations, with the crowd throwing stones and Molotov cocktails at the hostel. The police were outnumbered, and their attempts to control the situation were unsuccessful. The protesters managed to breach the police barricades and set the hostel on fire. The police were forced to withdraw to avoid further violence. In the subsequent days, the violence spread to other parts of the city. The rioters set fire to several buildings occupied by asylum seekers, including a house that was being used as a refugee center. The police were able to regain control of the situation after three days of violence. Aftermath: The Rostock-Lichtenhagen riots were widely condemned by the German government and civil society. However, they revealed the underlying tension and hostility towards immigrants and refugees in Germany. The government was forced to review its immigration policies and introduce stricter laws to prevent xenophobia. The riots also had a significant impact on German politics. The far-right political party, the National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD), gained momentum in the following years, capitalizing on the growing anti-immigrant sentiment among the population. Today, the Rostock-Lichtenhagen riots are remembered as a dark chapter in German history, a reminder of the dangers of xenophobia and the need to promote tolerance and diversity in modern democratic societies.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 15563818}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Parklet\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "A parklet is a sidewalk extension that provides more space and amenities for people using the street. Usually parklets are installed on parking lanes and use several parking spaces. Parklets typically extend out from the sidewalk at the level of the sidewalk to the width of the adjacent parking space.\n\nParklets are intended for people. Parklets offer a place to stop, to sit, and to rest while taking in the activities of the street. In instances where a parklet is not intended to accommodate people, it may provide greenery, art, or some other visual amenity. A parklet may accommodate bicycle parking within it, or bicycle parking may be associated with it.\n\nA parklet may be thought of as permanent, but must be designed for quick and easy removal for emergencies or other reasons such as snow removal without damage to the curb or street. As initially conceived, a parklet is always open to the public. However, some cities have allowed restaurants to create parklets that are not open to the public such as Long Beach, California, Fargo, North Dakota and Montreal, Quebec.\n\nHistory\nSan Francisco has been credited with introducing the first parklet. Parklets are the formalization of tactical urbanism project created by Rebar called Park(ing), which began in 2005 and grew into a worldwide phenomena called Park(ing) Day. The first one-day park(ing) installation was created in downtown San Francisco in 2005 as an unofficial activist project by feeding a parking meter with coins, unrolling grass sod, and placing a potted tree on top. The world's first formal public parklets were initially conceived by Italian/Brazilian designer and London resident Suzi Bolognese (Sb Design Studio) and installed in San Francisco in 2010. Since then, parklets have been introduced in cities such as Ames, Iowa, London, England and Puebla de Zaragoza, Mexico.\n \nIn August 2012, the School of Architecture at University of Southern California published a graduate thesis \"Experimenting with the Margin: Parklets and Plazas as Catalysts in Community and Government,\" which provided a comprehensive history of the creation of parklet and plaza programs in four California cities. In September 2012, the UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs published a report, \"Reclaiming the Right-of-Way: A toolkit for Creating and Implementing Parklets\", examining case studies for parklets in seven cities across North America. In February 2013, The San Francisco Planning Department published a Parklet Manual which serves as a comprehensive overview of the goals, policies, process, procedures and guidelines for creating a parklet in San Francisco. The Manual also serves as a resource for those outside of San Francisco working to establish parklet programs in their own cities.\n\nDesign and purpose\n\nParklets are designed to provide a public place for passersby to relax and enjoy the atmosphere of the city around them, in places where either current urban parks are lacking or where the existing sidewalk width is not large enough to accommodate vibrant street life activities. Parklets can be designed to be either permanent fixtures, or can be designed to be temporary/seasonal in places where snow removal is a concern. Seasonal parklets are found in New York City, Philadelphia, and Chicago. In 2015, Shiftspace Design introduced the world's longest seasonal parklet at 60 feet in length. Many cities choose to install these sites in order to create more public space by creating \"places for people to sit, relax and enjoy the city.\" The Vancouver 2013 Parklet Pilot Program Guide explains parklets purpose and design as \"benefit local businesses, residents, and visitors by providing unique public spaces that attract customers and foster community conversation. They can also have additional benefits such as adding more space for people to walk in congested areas. The typical design is a platform that extends the sidewalk and provides amenities like seats, tables, bike racks, and landscaping\"\n\nImpact studies\nIn September 2010, The San Francisco Great Streets Project (then part of the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition) published a study, \"Divisadero Trial Parklet Impact Report,\" on one of the first eight parklets built in San Francisco. This study was followed in January 2012 by a \"Parklet Impact Study\" analyzing three corridors in San Francisco. From October 2012 to March 2013, Los Angeles research collaborative Parklet Studies to design and implement a one-year study of the Parklets in downtown Los Angeles. The final report was released in March 2013 along with partners at the UCLA Lewis Center for Regional Policy Studies. New York City, Philadelphia, and Seattle have all since published evaluation reports from parklet and parklet-related efforts.\n\nLocations\nIn the United States, San Francisco hosts more parklets than any other City. The city's \"Pavement to Parks\" program was formed to facilitate installation of parklets as longer-term, yet still temporary, fixtures. As of 2011 the program had received over 50 applications from sponsors around the city. In 2011 the Union Square Business Improvement District installed the most ambitious parklet, a 2-block long installation along Powell Street near Union Square, funded by a corporate donation by Audi.\n\nParklets have sprung up in Phoenix, Philadelphia, Oakland, Los Angeles, San Jose, Dallas, Seattle, San Diego, Vancouver, British Columbia, Minneapolis, Chicago, Santa Monica, and Morro Bay, CA.\n\nParklets are typically spaces for passive recreation, The first parklets with active recreation were installed in Los Angeles, CA in February 2013. Two sites on Spring Street, in Downtown Los Angeles, each feature two exercise bicycles on site. Upon evaluation, 20% of people surveyed in the sites said they previously used the machines; but only 5% of activity observed recorded use of the machines. Active recreation use of parklets may need some additional motivation to increase use at the exercise machines.\n\nParklets have also been created in Mexico in Puebla de Zaragoza during the PueblaDesignFest\n\nThe first Parklet on the street in London has been installed in July 2015.\n\nIn April 2018, a Parklet was also created in Leeds, UK, as a result of a partnership between Yorkshire Design Group, Leeds Business Improvement District (LeedsBID), Leeds City Council, and LAAND landscape architects.\n\nIn December 2019, the Metro Tunnel Creative Program in Melbourne, Australia, installed a parklet on Domain Road - an area impacted by the construction of the new tunnel and station. Local restaurants were able to increase their street trading permits into the parklet - which also helped them maintain physical distancing for patrons waiting for takeaways during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSee also\n Pocket park\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Pavement to Parks, San Francisco\n Adelaide City Council Parklet Program, South Australia\n People Spots, Chicago, IL\n City of Vancouver, Parklets\n New York City Department of Transportation, Street Seats\n Morro Bay Parklet Pilot Program\n Victoria, British Columbia, Canada \u2014 Parklet\n Hackney installs country's first US-inspired on-street micro park \nPop-up Leeds park is calling for the Summer\n\nParks\nPedestrian infrastructure\nStreet furniture\nUrban planning", "machine_text": "Parklet A parklet is a small public space created by reclaiming a portion of a street or parking spot to provide an area for people to relax, socialize, and enjoy their surroundings. Often installed in urban areas, parklets are an innovative way to make cities more livable, walkable, and equitable. History The first parklet was installed in San Francisco in 2005 by the design collective Rebar. It was a temporary installation, created for a single day to raise awareness about the need for more public space in the city. This first parklet was a huge success, inspiring other groups to create their own parklets in the following years. Soon, cities across the United States and around the world began to adopt parklets as a way to improve the quality of urban life. Today, parklets can be found in cities as diverse as Seattle, Philadelphia, and Melbourne, Australia. Design Parklets come in a variety of shapes and sizes, depending on the needs and desires of the community that creates them. Some are designed for seating and relaxation, with comfortable benches or chairs and plantings to provide shade and beauty. Others are more active, with games or exercise equipment to encourage physical activity. One key feature of parklets is that they are designed to be flexible and adaptable. Many are built on wheels or other portable platforms, making them easy to move or rearrange if necessary. This allows communities to experiment with different layouts and configurations to find what works best for them. Benefits There are many benefits to parklets. They provide much-needed public space in urban areas, where green spaces and gathering places are often in short supply. They also encourage walking, cycling, and public transportation by reducing the space dedicated to cars. Parklets can also have positive economic effects by creating more foot traffic in commercial areas. A study by the San Francisco Planning Department found that businesses located near parklets saw a 14% increase in sales. Conclusion Parklets are a creative and innovative way to create public space in urban areas. They provide a place for people to gather, relax, and enjoy their surroundings, while also promoting healthy and sustainable transportation. As more cities embrace parklets, it is likely that we will see even more innovative designs and uses for these unique public spaces.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 27403248}

In 2007, the event was one of the first in the region to welcome a prime minister when the then Italian leader Romano Prodi visited the exhibition with his minister for international trade. In 2012, British prime minister David Cameron also visited the event in support of his nation\u2019s export businesses. The visits reflected both the value of bilateral trade with the UAE but also the rise in importance of the Persian Gulf region as a whole to European export manufacturers.\n\nEducational events and special features \n\nSince 2010 there has been an increasing emphasis on education within the events - in the form of conferences, seminars and workshops - to support continued professional development among audiences.

The film stars Rasika Dugal, Vikas Kumar and Talha Arshad Reshi in major roles, and is an adaptation of the play Phone No. 786 by Mohd. Amin Bhat. The story revolves about a seven-year-old Hamid who learns that 786 is God's number and decides to try and reach out to God, by dialing this number. He wants to talk to his father, who his classmate tells him has gone to Allah. One fine day the phone call is answered, and two lives shattered in the strife of Kashmir find a way to be complete again. The film is produced by Yoodlee Films, a venture of Saregama. The official trailer was released on 10 October 2018. Global premiere of Hamid was held at the Jio MAMI 20th Mumbai Film Festival. The film went on to win the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Urdu at the 66th National Film Awards hosted in August 2019.\n\nPlot \n\nHamid is a young boy of seven, in search of his father who went missing a year ago. He somehow discovers that 786 is Allah's number, makes some combination and finally dials a phone number which is answered. Thus begins a series of conversations with the person on the other line who happens to be a CRPF soldier finding solace in Hamid's innocent talk. Hamid tells him about his father, his teachings and how his absence has changed their lives. Meanwhile, Hamid's mother is not able to make peace with the fact that her husband has disappeared. She is always lost in her grief and is dejected. \nHamid tries to learn his father's boat-making craft among various other means to please Allah, in belief that his father might return some day. Finally on one of the days Hamid realizes that his father is dead and would never return. His mother comes to terms with his death on the very same day. In the epilogue it is shown that Hamid finally gets his much desired red paint for the newly deigned boat (probably sent by the CRPF jawan), paints it and sails on it with his mother.\n\nThe film denotes how eventually people learn to deal with tragedies and move on no matter what, and serves as a powerful depiction of human resilience. What is striking is also the fact that despite being naive the boy knows the difference between what is right and what is wrong due to his father's teachings, again stressing the fact that we are a result of our upbringing.\n\nCast\nTalha Arshad Reshi as Hamid\nVikas Kumar as Abhay \nRasika Dugal as Ishrat\nSumit Kaul as Rehmat\nMir Sarwar as Abbass\nBashir Lone as Rasool Chacha\nVeer Rajwant Singh as Rajinder\nAshraf Nagoo as Basheer\nQazi Faiz as Beggar\nUmar Adil as Police Officer\nGulam Hussain Barji as Shopkeeper\nSajid as Police Constable\nShafia as Noor\n\nMarketing and release\nThe theatrical release poster of the film was released on 11 February 2019 giving the release date as 1 March 2019.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Frogs in culture\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Frogs play a variety of roles in culture, appearing in folklore and fairy tales such as the Brothers Grimm story of The Frog Prince. In ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, frogs symbolized fertility, while in classical antiquity, the Greeks and Romans associated frogs with fertility, harmony, and licentiousness.\n\nFrogs are the subjects of fables attributed to Aesop, of proverbs in various cultures, and of art. Frog characters such as Kermit the Frog and Pepe the Frog feature in popular culture. They are eaten in some parts of the world including France. In Australia, a fondant dessert is known as frog cake.\n\nHistory \nFolklorist Andrew Lang listed myths about a frog or toad that swallows or blocks the flow of waters occurring in many world mythologies.\n\nOn the other hand, researcher Anna Engelking drew attention to the fact that studies on Indo-European mythology and its language see \"a link between frogs and the underworld, and \u2013 by extension \u2013 sickness and death\".\n\nAncient Mesopotamia\nIn the Sumerian epic poem of Inanna and Enki, the goddess Inanna tricks Enki, the god of water, into giving her all of the sacred mes, prompting Enki to send various watery creatures to retrieve them. The first of these is a frog, whom Enki grasps \"by its right hand\". Frogs also appear as filling motifs on cylinder seals of the Kassite Period.\n\nAncient Egypt \n\nTo the Egyptians, the frog was a symbol of life and fertility, since millions of them were born after the annual flooding of the Nile, which brought fertility to the otherwise barren lands. Consequently, in Egyptian mythology, there began to be a frog-goddess, who represented fertility, named Heqet. Heqet was usually depicted as a frog, or a woman with a frog's head, or more rarely as a frog on the end of a phallus to explicitly indicate her association with fertility. A lesser known Egyptian god, Kek, was also sometimes shown in the form of a frog.\n\nTexts of the Late Period describe the Ogdoad of Hermepolis, a group of eight \"primeval\" gods, as having the heads of frogs (male) and serpents (female), and they are often depicted in this way in reliefs of the Greco-Roman period.\nThe god Nu in particular is sometimes depicted either with the head of a frog surmounted by a beetle.\n\nHapi was a deification of the annual flood of the Nile River, in Egyptian mythology, which deposited rich silt on the banks, allowing the Egyptians to grow crops. In Lower Egypt, he was adorned with papyrus plants, and attended by frogs, present in the region, and symbols of it.\n\nClassical antiquity \n\nThe Greeks and Romans associated frogs with fertility and harmony, and with licentiousness in association with Aphrodite. The combat between the Frogs and the Mice (Batrachomyomachia) was a mock epic, commonly attributed to Homer, though in fact a parody of his Iliad. The Frogs Who Desired a King is a fable, attributed to Aesop. The Frogs prayed to Zeus asking for a King. Zeus set up a log to be their monarch. The Frogs protested they wanted a fierce and terrible king, not a mere figurehead. So Zeus sent them a Stork to be their king. The new king hunted and devoured his subjects. Aesop wrote a fable about a frog trying to inflate itself to the size of an ox. Phaedrus (and later Jean de La Fontaine) wrote versions of this fable. The Frogs is a comic play by Aristophanes, in which the choir of frogs sings the famous onomatopoeic line: \"Brekekekex koax koax.\"\n\nIn the Bible, the Second Plague of Egypt described in the Book of Exodus 8:6 is of frogs. In the New Testament, frogs are associated with unclean spirits in Revelation 16:13.\n\nMedieval and Early Modern \n\nMedieval Christian tradition based on the Physiologus distinguished land frogs from water frogs representing righteous and sinful congregationists, respectively. In folk religion and occultism, the frog also became associated with witchcraft or as an ingredient for love potions.\n\nThe Japanese poet Matsuo Bash\u014d wrote one of his most famous haiku about a frog jumping into an old pond.\n\nIn folk and fairy tales\nThe frog is also a character in many fairy tales, be it tales from oral tradition or literary reworkings by later writers.\n\nThe frog or toad appears as a potential suitor to a female human in variants of the Aarne\u2013Thompson\u2013Uther type ATU 440, \"The Frog King\". The most famous is the story of The Frog Prince. It also appears as a female bride in tales of the ATU 402 type, \"The Animal Bride\", such as Puddocky (German fairy tale), The Frog Princess (Russian fairy tale) and The Three Feathers (German fairy tale).\n\nIt also acts as a helper of the heroes and heroines, such as in the beginning of the story of the Sleeping Beauty, and in French literary fairy tales The Benevolent Frog (by MMe. d'Aulnoy) and The Little Green Frog.\n\nIn Hans Christian Andersen's lengthy fairy tale \"The Marsh King's Daughter,\" a beautiful young woman is transformed, night after night, into a large, mournful frog.  With the first rays of dawn, she changes back to human form.\n\nThe toad appears as a transformation for the hero Jiraiya in the Japanese story The Tale of the Gallant Jiraiya.\n\nThe frog appears in the form of a beautiful maiden, named Bheki, in a tale from Sanskrit legend. The amphibian, in this story, symbolizes the sun.\n\nIn modern culture\n\nProverbs and popular traditions\nThe \"frog in a well\" saying about having a narrow vision of life is found in Sanskrit (\"Kupa Manduka\", \u0915\u0941\u092a\u092e\u0928\u094d\u0921\u0941\u0915), in Bengali, \u0995\u09c1\u09aa\u09ae\u09a8\u09cd\u09a1\u09c1\u0995), in Vietnamese \"\u1ebech ng\u1ed3i \u0111\u00e1y gi\u1ebfng coi tr\u1eddi b\u1eb1ng vung\" (\"Sitting at the bottom of wells, frogs think that the sky is as wide as a lid\"), and in Malay \"Bagai katak dibawah tempurung\" (\"Like a frog under a coconut shell\").. The Chinese versions are   \"\u5750\u4e95\u89c0\u5929\" (\"sitting in the well, looking to the sky\") and \"\u4e95\u5e95\u4e4b\u86d9\" (\"a frog in a well\") from the Taoist classic Zhuangzi that has a frog living in an abandoned well, who talks about things big and small with the turtle of the Eastern Sea.\n\nOther frog proverbs include the American \"You can't tell by looking at a frog how high he will jump.\" and the Iranian \"When the snake gets old, the frog gets him by the balls.\"\n\nIn Chinese traditional culture, frog represents the lunar yin, and the Frog spirit Ch'ing-Wa Sheng is associated with healing and good fortune in business, although a frog in a well is symbolic of a person lacking in understanding and vision.\n\nThe supposed behavior of frogs illustrating nonaction is told in the often-repeated story of the boiled frog: put a frog in boiling water and it will jump out, but put it in cold water and slowly heat it, and it will not notice the danger and will be boiled alive. The story was based on nineteenth century experiments in which frogs were shown to stay in heating water as long as it was heated very slowly. The validity of the experiments is however disputed. Professor Douglas Melton, Harvard University Biology Department, says: \"If you put a frog in boiling water, it won't jump out. It will die. If you put it in cold water, it will jump before it gets hot\u2014they don't sit still for you.\"\n\nThe short poem \"What a queer bird\", which appeared in magazines in the 1920s, is about the qualities of a frog from a bird's perspective.\n\nIn Finland, miniature wooden coffins containing frogs have been discovered under the floors of some churches, and in other places such as in a field, under a cowshed, in rapids, or in a hearth. They are thought to have been part of a practice of magic, or to protect against magic.\n\nAccording to researcher Anna Engelking, there is a certain naming taboo in Polish folk belief regarding calling a child a frog, since it may stump the child's growth. Hence, there is a verbal avoidance of mentioning the frog by its name, instead using an euphemism that denotes some trait (i.e, 'the one that jumps').\n\nIn art\nThe Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped animals and often depicted frogs in their art. Painters of the Dutch Golden Age sometimes included frogs in their compositions; for example, Ambrosius Bosschaert II painted a vanitas still life Dead Frog with Flies c. 1630; in 2012, the artists Rob and Nick Carter created a silent digital version, lasting three hours, in which the \"still\" image \"slowly, imperceptibly\" changes with the movement of the sun, and occasionally an insect such as a dragonfly enters the scene.\n\nContemporary pop culture\n\nThe theme of transformation features prominently in popular culture, from The Frog Prince to fantasy settings such as the Final Fantasy and Chrono Trigger video games with magic spells that turn people into frogs.\n\nMichigan J. Frog featured in a Warner Brothers cartoon. Kermit the Frog is the straight man character in Sesame Street and The Muppet Show.\n\nSeveral Pok\u00e9mon species are based on frogs and toads, such as the Poliwrath, Politoed, Seismitoad, and Greninja evolutionary families.\n\nTsuyu Asui/Froppy, a superhero with frog related powers, features in the manga and anime series My Hero Academia.\n\nPepe the Frog is a frog character from a webcomic which became a popular Internet meme, and was eventually appropriated as a symbol of the controversial alt-right movement.\n\nCuisine and confectionery\n\nFrogs are eaten, notably in France. One dish is known as cuisses de grenouille, frogs' legs, and although it is not especially common, it is taken as indicative of French cuisine. From this, \"frog\" has also developed into a common derogatory term for French people in English.\n\nFreddo Frog is a popular Australian chocolate, while frog cake is a Heritage Listed South Australian fondant dessert. Crunchy Frog is a fictitious confectionery from a Monty Python skit of the same name. Chocolate Frogs are a popular sweet in the Harry Potter universe.\n\nSee also\n Ethnoherpetology\n List of fictional frogs\n Salamanders in folklore and legend\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n Vince-Pallua, Jelka. \"What Can the Mythical Frog Tell Us?

They have been portrayed as symbols of luck, transformation, and even evil. This article will explore the various ways frogs have been represented in different cultures throughout history. In Egyptian mythology, the goddess Heket was represented in the form of a frog. She was the goddess of fertility and was believed to be responsible for the birthing process. Egyptians believed that the presence of frogs in a household was a sign of fertility and good luck. In Japanese culture, frogs are considered symbols of good luck. This is due in part to the fact that the Japanese word for frog, \"kaeru,\" is a homophone for the word meaning \"return,\" which is often associated with safe travels. Additionally, a specific type of frog called the Daruma frog is often depicted carrying a large sack on its back, which is believed to bring good fortune and prosperity. In some Native American cultures, frogs are believed to have healing powers and are used in various medicinal practices. They are also associated with transformation and rebirth, due to their ability to undergo metamorphosis from a tadpole to a full-grown frog. However, not all cultures view frogs in a positive light. In Christian art, frogs are often depicted as symbols of evil. In the Book of Revelations, frogs are one of the plagues sent by God to punish the wicked. In African culture, frogs are believed to be messengers of death, and their appearance is often seen as a bad omen. Despite the varied interpretations of frogs in different cultures, one thing is certain: these amphibians have left a lasting impression on human society. From ancient mythology to modern pop culture, frogs continue to fascinate and intrigue us with their unique characteristics and symbolism.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 3865065}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Lightweighting\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Lightweighting is a concept in the auto industry about building cars and trucks that are less heavy as a way to achieve better fuel efficiency and handling. Carmakers make parts from carbon fiber, windshields from plastic, and bumpers out of aluminum foam, as ways to lessen vehicle load. Replacing car parts with lighter materials does not lessen overall safety for drivers, according to one view, since many plastics have a high strength-to-weight ratio. \n\nThe search to replace car parts with lighter ones is not limited to any one type of part; according to a spokesman for Ford Motor Company, engineers strive for lightweighting \"anywhere we can.\" Using lightweight materials such as plastics can mean less strain on the engine and better gas mileage as well as improved handling. One material sometimes used to reduce weight is carbon fiber. The auto industry has used the term for many years, as the effort to keep making cars lighter is ongoing. \n\nAnother common material used for lightweighting is aluminum. Incorporating aluminum has grown continuously to not only meet CAFE standards, but to also improve automotive performance. A vehicle with lower weight has better acceleration, braking and handling. In addition, lighter vehicles can tow and haul larger loads because the engine is not carrying unnecessary weight. A light\nweighting magazine finds: \"Even though aluminum is light, it does not sacrifice strength. Aluminum body structure is equal in strength to steel and can absorb twice as much crash-induced energy.\"\n\nReferences\n\nAutomotive technologies\nMaterials science\nEnvironmental engineering", "machine_text": "Lightweighting refers to the process of reducing the weight of a product, component, or structure while retaining its strength and functionality. It is becoming increasingly important in a wide range of fields, including automotive, aerospace, and consumer goods, as the demand for energy-efficient and eco-friendly products grows. One of the primary benefits of lightweighting is that it can significantly reduce fuel consumption and emissions in transportation vehicles. For instance, reducing the weight of a car by 10% can increase its fuel efficiency by up to 8%. Similarly, lightweighting airplane structures and components can decrease fuel consumption and emissions and increase payload capacity. There are various approaches to lightweighting, including the use of lightweight materials such as aluminum, magnesium, carbon fiber, and composites. Another approach is redesigning components and structures to optimize their strength-to-weight ratio. Computer-aided design and simulation tools enable engineers to explore different lightweighting options and minimize the risk of failure or safety issues. However, lightweighting also poses challenges, such as cost and reliability concerns, as well as the potential negative impacts on safety, durability, and repairability. For instance, the use of lightweight materials can increase the cost of manufacturing and maintenance, and may require specialized equipment and skills. In conclusion, lightweighting is a critical strategy for achieving sustainability and improving product performance in many industries. However, it requires a careful balance between weight reduction and functionality, safety, and cost-effectiveness, and calls for continuous innovation and collaboration among stakeholders.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 46381123}

The fairy wrasses are known for their bright neon colors.\n\nThe Orangeback Fairy Wrasses are like many wrasses in that they live in harems of many females in a group with only one male. The male is the dominant fish with the stronger colors and traits. There have been no small males that have been recorded so it is believed that all Orangeback Fairy Wrasses\u2019 begin as females and then some females transform into males.\nThe Cirrhilabrus species eats mainly Zooplankton, they have pair of teeth in the front and a set of teeth wrapped around the side which is used to break down their food.\nOrangeback Fairy wrasses are found in shallow waters mainly ranging from 10\u201375 feet but also can be found deeper.   When the Fairy wrasses are found in deeper depths however, their fluorescence allows them to see wavelengths that wouldn't otherwise be available.

This fish species is endemic to the waters around the Indonesian island of Bali and is primarily found in the coral reefs and rocky areas of the coast. Appearance As the name suggests, the Orangeback fairy-wrasse gets its name from the bright orange color that covers the upper part of its body, from the head to the base of the tail fin. The lower part of the fish's body, including the underside, is a striking pinkish-red, and the dorsal, anal, and tail fins are a vivid blue. Males of this species are typically larger than females, and possess elongated dorsal rays that give them a more prominent and colorful appearance. Behavior The Orangeback fairy-wrasse is a peaceful and non-aggressive species that is typically seen in small groups, swimming in close proximity to its coral reef habitats. This species feeds primarily on small crustaceans, including copepods and amphipods, and also consumes various zooplankton. Conservation status The Orangeback fairy-wrasse is not currently listed on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species. However, as with many coral reef species, their habitat is under threat from climate change, coral bleaching, and ocean acidification, which could lead to declining populations in the future. Aquarium trade The Orangeback fairy-wrasse is highly sought after by aquarium hobbyists due to its vibrant and striking colors. However, captive-bred specimens are preferred over wild-caught individuals, as they have a higher chance of survival and success in captivity. It is important to ensure that individuals are sourced ethically and legally to prevent the disruption of wild populations. In conclusion, the Orangeback fairy-wrasse is a stunning and eye-catching species that plays an important role in the coral reef ecosystems of Indonesia.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Sobib\u00f3r Museum\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Sobib\u00f3r Museum, or the Museum of the Former Sobib\u00f3r Nazi Death Camp (), is a Polish state-owned museum devoted to memorializing the victims and atrocities committed at the former Sobibor extermination camp, located on the outskirts of Sobib\u00f3r near Lublin. The Nazi German death camp was set up in occupied Poland during World War II, as part of the Jewish extermination program known as the Operation Reinhard, which marked the most deadly phase of the Holocaust in Poland. The camp was run by the SS Sonderkommando Sobibor, initially commanded by Franz Stangl. The number of Jews from Poland and elsewhere who were gassed and cremated there between April 1942 and October 14, 1943, is estimated at 250,000; possibly more, including those who were transported from other Reich-occupied countries.\n\nSince May 1, 2012, the Sobib\u00f3r Museum has been managed as a branch of the Majdanek State Museum, dedicated to the history and commemoration of the Holocaust camps and subcamps of KL Lublin. Originally, the museum served as a branch of the district museum in nearby W\u0142odawa, founded in 1981. The museum was temporarily closed to the public from April 2011 to May 2013 due to lack of funds. The Ministry of Culture and National Heritage reopened the Museum with additional funding after its administrative reorganisation.\n\nArchaeological and conservation work was conducted at the site between 2007 and 2017, revealing formerly buried features of the camp and thousands of items belonging to the victims. The mass grave site was covered with geotextile and crushed marble in 2017. In 2020, a new Museum and Memorial in Sobib\u00f3r was inaugurated, with 323-square meters of exhibition space, displaying a permanent exhibition artifacts, photographs and documents.\n\nMuseum history\n\nBecause the Nazis had closed and destroyed the camp in late 1943, replanting the site to hide the evidence of what had taken place, little was known about the camp for years. The Sobibor trial in Hagen, Germany, and the parallel Hiwi, or Trawniki trials in Krasnodar in the former USSR brought publicity to the Nazi-directed activities at this death camp. These trials were inspired by the investigative work of Simon Wiesenthal, and the highly publicized capture of Adolf Eichmann in 1960 from Argentina by the Israeli Mossad, to stand trial in Jerusalem.\n\nMost Holocaust survivors had left Poland long before these events, and few from the camp are known to have survived the war. The camp was largely forgotten.\n\nThe first monument to Sobib\u00f3r victims was erected in 1965 on the historic site. The W\u0142odawa Museum, which commissioned the monument, established a separate Sobib\u00f3r branch on October 14, 1993, on the 50th anniversary of the armed uprising of Jewish prisoners there. After some 300 prisoners escaped in 1943, the Nazis closed and destroyed the camp to try to hide the evidence of the mass killings. Only 58 of those former prisoners are known to have survived the war.\n\nThe small museum was scheduled to be replaced with a modern visitor centre, with a design chosen from an international design competition in 2013, sponsored by the Polish-German Foundation Pojednanie. On June 24, 2014, the State Secretary from the Polish Ministry of Culture and National Heritage presented the winning design at a ceremony in Warsaw. Attending were the King of the Netherlands Willem Alexander and his wife Queen M\u00e1xima, partners in the project along with Israel, Poland, and Slovakia. After parts of the former camp grounds were excavated by archeologists and the field of mass graves covered with geotextile and crushed marble, construction work on the new museum complex began in 2017.\n\nThe permanent exhibition of the new Museum and Memorial in Sobib\u00f3r was inaugurated on October 29, 2020, with 323 square meters of exhibition space. Over 700 personal items belonging to the victims of the camp, from among 11,000 artifacts held by the museum, as well as documents and photographs, form the centerpiece of the exhibition. Sixteen thematic areas explain the history of the extermination camp and the Holocaust in occupied Poland.\n\nResearch and conservation programs\n\nThe Museum complex comprises a building, archives, and monuments. The museum building is located near the former railway station; these are connected by a paved Trail of Memory. Memorial monuments include a cast-iron statue of a woman with child, sculpted by Mieczys\u0142aw Welter. It is installed on the former \"Road to Heaven\" (Himmelfahrtstrasse). In addition, a large circular enclosure has a mound of ashes and crushed bones of the victims, collected at the site and formed into a broad pyramid next to the original open-air cremation pits. A local archive of the facsimiles of testimonies and pertinent documents is available at the museum.\n\nThe camp is scheduled to undergo more advanced geophysical studies and further archaeological excavations to explore the site. Practically no fixed objects of any kind are found within the site, since the SS meticulously removed as much evidence as possible. Any research work around and near the graves is conducted under the strict supervision of the Chief Rabbi of Poland, Michael Schudrich.\n\nThe first excavation project was completed in October 2007. More than one thousand items belonging to the victims were unearthed. In October 2009, the second excavation phase was conducted, which determined the exact placement of double-row barbed-wire fencing posts around the camp. The work revealed numerous new artifacts as well, including false teeth, keepsakes from Marienbad, and many suitcase keys.  In the autumn of 2012, the north-western section around mass graves 1 and 2 was analyzed. Geophysical  evidence was found of the barbed-wire enclosure that separated mass graves and cremation pits from the living area of Camp III, and that marked the perimeter of the killing zone.\n\nIn May 2013 the Israeli and Polish archaeologists conducting excavations near Camp III, unearthed an escape tunnel  long and 1.6\u20132\u00a0m deep in some places, beginning under the barracks of the Jewish Sonderkommando and leading toward a double-row, barbed-wire fence. The tunnel may have collapsed with people inside; the camp perimeter is known to have been mined. Notably, the camp records do not mention any incident related to a tunnel escape.\n\nOther new findings included children's identification tags from the Netherlands, and seven human skeletal remains. These may be remains of the Jewish work-detail who were shot after completing removal of the genocide evidence.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Museum and Memorial in Sobib\u00f3r \u2013 Official site (English)\n \"Sobibor.

In 1958, in accordance with revised legislation, she was chosen to serve as a pastor in L\u00fcbeck. On Easter Sunday 1959, she was ceremoniously appointed to head the city's Evangelical Women's Association, becoming the first woman in Germany to hold the title of pastor. She maintained the position until she died in an accident in 1974.\n\nBiography\nBorn on 30 June 1914 in Rome, Elisabeth Haseloff was the daughter of Arthur Haseloff (1872\u20131955), an art historian. She was brought up in a cultural environment in Kiel, meeting numerous figures associated with art and science. When she was 14, deeply moved by her confirmation, she resolved to study theology. As a result, in 1935 she embarked on her studies at the University of T\u00fcbingen.\n\nDuring the Nazi era, she became a member of the Confessing Church. After taking her first theological examination in 1939, she gained practical experience of clerical work at St Anschar's Church in Neum\u00fcnster. She was particularly active in caring for hospital patients but also preached on occasion, although it was against the rules. She was not supposed to do more than hold Bible classes but during the war, it was not unusual for women to deliver sermons.\n\nShe took the second theology exam in 1941, becoming the first woman to do so in Schleswig-Holstein. After assisting the pastor in B\u00fcdelsdorf, in the absence of male pastors, in 1946 she was entrusted with responsibility for the parish. She remained in B\u00fcdelsdorf until 1959.\n\nIn the late 1950s, there was a vacancy for a pastor in one of the parishes in L\u00fcbeck. Realizing that Haseloff could fill the post, the synod drafted a \"church law for the parochial employment of a female pastor\", the first of its kind in Germany. On Whit Sunday 1959, she was installed as the first female pastor in the Evangelical Church of Germany, a development which was widely reported in the press. \n\nShe turned out to be very effective in her new position, arranging seminars on collaboration between men and women in the church, inviting women politicians, doctors, trade unionists and teachers. She was also active in arranging meetings between women in East and West Germany and in collaboration with Africa. In 1962, she invited three Tanzanian women to study in L\u00fcbeck as kindergarten teachers, hosting them in her own home. \n\nOn 29 November 1974, Elisabeth Haseloff met with a fatal accident in Hamburg while crossing the street on a zebra crossing.\n\nReferences\n\n1914 births\n1974 deaths\nClergy from L\u00fcbeck\nGerman Lutheran clergy\nWomen Lutheran clergy\nUniversity of Kiel alumni", "machine_text": "Elisabeth Haseloff is a German politician and member of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU).

For the first three years they mainly played concerts in Estonia, with a few also in Latvia, Lithuania and Russia. Later the band has toured Europe several times.\n\nThey became one of the more popular rock outfits in Estonia. In 1987 Villu wrote \"Tere Perestroika\", initially singing it alone with guitar. Later the band made numerous different versions of the song. It became a big hit because of its humorous topicality (Perestroika) and in 1988 won a song contest on a popular Estonian TV show. In 1988 came the first line-up change \u2013 Tarvo Hanno Varres left the band, later to join Estonian indie rock group R\u00f6\u00f6vel \u00d6\u00f6bik and a new bass player, Lembit, joined the band.\n\nIn 1989 the newly created Finnish record label Stupido Twins, with the aim of publishing some Estonian bands. J.M.K.E.'s \"Tere Perestroika\" was the first release. The winds of change in the Soviet Union had already blown some chains away, and so J.M.K.E. were able to travel abroad for the first time in April 1989, playing their first concert in Finland to middle-aged communists at the Leftist Forum in Helsinki. Later that autumn they recorded for Stupido Twins their first LP, K\u00fclmale Maale (To the Cold Country), which was the first Estonian rock record made abroad. Maximum Rock'n'Roll called it \"absolutely excellent\". At the end of 1989, Venno left the band declaring that J.M.K.E. had \u201cBecome too commercial for me\u201d, and Ardo took his place.\n\nThe band toured Estonia, the Nordic countries, and Germany, made a couple of EPs, and only by 1993 started to record a new album, Gringode Kultuur (Culture of Gringos). Meanwhile Estonia had regained its independence and J.M.K.E. couldn't continue with their anti-Soviet songs, so they found their new \"enemy\" in the invading \"burger-culture\", increasing poverty, and other early-capitalistic distresses. Lembit left the band in 1994 and was replaced by Sten. J.M.K.E. got also a new drummer, Andres.\n\nTheir third album, Sputniks in Pectopah (\"Sputniks at Restaurant\"), was released in 1995. The album is an eclectic collection of popular Russian songs, sung in high energy Russian. The cover versions include the national anthem of czarist Russia, old revolutionary marches, soldiers' songs from World War II, and melodies from popular cartoons.\n\nIn January 1996 J.M.K.E. celebrated their 10th birthday with the longest lasting concert of their history presenting on stage almost all persons who had ever played with the band, permanently or temporarily, and with a cassette-only-release, Rumal Nali (Silly Joke, on Fucking Cunt Records). This contained old D.I.Y. recordings mainly from 1986 and 1987. J.M.K.E. didn't make their first \"tidy\" studio recording until 1989 in Finland although by that stage they had enough songs for three or four albums. It was just impossible to release punk rock records under the vigilant glance of sickle and hammer.\n\nJ.M.K.E. have gradually abandoned their directly political slogans and now tell more varied stories than before. Their fifth album,  (Invasion of Rabbits, 1996), is a good example of their present character. Some consider it to be J.M.K.E.'s best product since \"K\u00fclmale Maale\".\n\nIn 2000, after 4 years of silence, the album  was released. By then female back-up singers Livia Kurik (\"Tirts\") and Kerti Alev (\"Promille Promille\") joined the band; they left in 2012.\n\nIn 2006 J.M.K.E. released another album. This one for their 20th birthday, called M\u00e4lestusi Eesti NSV-st (A Memoir of the Estonian SSR). This includes songs that were recorded in a professional studio for the first time, for example \"\", \"\", \"\" and many more.\n\nIn 2011, the album Jasonit ei huvita was released, which features a selection of cover songs.

Notably, J.M.K.E. was one of the first Estonian bands to play punk rock, which made them popular among the local youth who were disillusioned with the Soviet-era culture and music. J.M.K.E. played their first concert in Tartu, Estonia, in the winter of 1986, quickly gaining a following among the underground circles. Their music was characterized by fast-paced and energetic punk rock, with political and social themes highlighted in their lyrics. J.M.K.E. became well-known for their anti-authoritarianism and social commentary, which resonated with the Estonian youth during the tumultuous era of the Soviet Union's collapse.

The COVID-19 pandemic, which originated in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, rapidly spread across the world in early 2020, leading to widespread lockdowns and social distancing measures. The pandemic has resulted in millions of deaths worldwide, leading to both social and economic unrest globally. In addition to the pandemic, 2020 also saw a record-breaking number of natural disasters, including severe wildfires in Australia and the United States, devastating hurricanes and floods in Central America, and massive explosions in Beirut and other locations. The resulting loss of life, property, and infrastructure damage further compounded the challenges already posed by the pandemic. The year was also marked by political turmoil in several countries, with protests, controversies, and election-related conflicts in many parts of the world. These further amplified the sense of chaos and uncertainty that characterized the year. The phrase \"The Year of the Everlasting Storm\" was coined by acclaimed author Colum McCann, who, along with six other leading literary figures, collaborated on a book of fiction dealing with the themes of disaster and resilience in the face of adversity. The book, published in April 2021, includes a collection of short stories from these writers that converge around the central themes of courage, community, and hope amidst the challenges posed by the year 2020. In conclusion, The Year of the Everlasting Storm will always be remembered as a year of unprecedented global challenges, marked by one disaster after another.

The shire's administrative center is the town of Mullewa, and it also includes several smaller settlements such as Walkaway, Bringo, and Yandanooka. Established on December 1, 1871, the Shire of Greenough was named after Francis Thomas Gregory's family estate, which was located in England. It initially covered a much larger area than it does today and included parts of the Gascoyne and Mid West regions. Over time, portions of the shire were hived off to create new local government areas, including the City of Geraldton-Greenough and the Shire of Carnamah. The shire is primarily agricultural, with its economy heavily relying on sheep and grain farming. Fishing and tourism also play significant roles in the local economy. The area surrounding the shire is known for its natural beauty, including the Murchison River Gorges and the Kalbarri National Park, which attracts thousands of tourists each year. The Shire of Greenough has a population of around 3,000 and is administered by a council consisting of 9 elected members. The current council is headed by Shire President Karen Chappel, who has been in office since 2017.

It is an L-shaped two-story brick structure, its original main block set close to Washington Street and facing north.  It is covered by a hip roof, with two chimneys rising behind the main ridge line.  The main facade is five bays wide, with a symmetrical placement of sash windows around the centered entrance.  Windows are capped by brownstone lintels, and the building corners are finished with brownstone quoining. The main entrance features a doorway with half-round fanlight, and a gabled portico supported by slender round columns.  The main roof's cornice has dentil moulding, and its front face is pierced by three dormers, with peaked or semicircular gables.\n\nThe house was built in the 1790s for Benjamin Williams, a well-to-do sea captain (Middletown was then a major shipping center in trade with the West Indies).  Williams died in 1812, and his heirs sold the house to Henry deKoven.  It remained in the hands of his descendants until 1942, during which time it was converted to professional use.

Such a solution is formed by random mixing of components of similar molar volume and without strong specific interactions, and its behavior diverges from that of an ideal solution by showing phase separation at intermediate compositions and temperatures (a miscibility gap). Its entropy of mixing is equal to that of an ideal solution with the same composition, due to random mixing without strong specific interactions.

It can also be shown using the Gibbs-Duhem relation that if the first Margules expression holds, then the other one must have the same shape. A regular solutions internal energy will vary during mixing or during process.\n\nThe value of  can be interpreted as W/RT, where W = 2U12 - U11 - U22 represents the difference in interaction energy between like and unlike neighbors.\n\nIn contrast to ideal solutions, regular solutions do possess a non-zero enthalpy of mixing, due to the W term. If the unlike interactions are more unfavorable than the like ones, we get competition between an entropy of mixing term that produces a minimum in the Gibbs free energy at x1 = 0.5 and the enthalpy term that has a maximum there. At high temperatures, the entropic term in the free energy of mixing dominates and the system is fully miscible, but at lower temperatures the G(x1) curve will have two minima and a maximum in between. This results in phase separation. In general there will be a temperature where the three extremes coalesce and the system becomes fully miscible. This point is known as the upper critical solution temperature or the upper consolute temperature.\n\nIn contrast to ideal solutions, the volumes in the case of regular solutions are no longer strictly additive but must be calculated from partial molar volumes that are a function of x1.\n\nThe term was introduced in 1927 by the American physical chemist Joel Henry Hildebrand.\n\nSee also\n Solid solution\n\nReferences\n\nThermodynamics\nChemical thermodynamics", "machine_text": "Regular solution A regular solution is a type of mixing thermodynamics model used to describe the behavior of two liquid components when they are mixed together. It is a representation of the thermodynamic properties of a mixture of two substances, which has constant chemical potential as a function of composition. Regular solutions are useful in understanding many phenomena in chemistry, including the behavior of polymers, alloys, and aqueous solutions. The concept of a regular solution is based on the assumption that the two components in the mixture have a similar size and shape and that they are totally miscible in each other. Essentially, this means that they have similar molecular interactions, and when they are mixed together, they form a homogeneous solution. The regular solution model is based on the Gibbs free energy of mixing, which is determined using the equation \u0394Gmix = RT\u03a3x1x2\u03a912, where x1 and x2 are the mole fractions of components 1 and 2, respectively, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, and \u03a912 is the interaction parameter. The interaction parameter describes the strength of the interactions between the two components and can be measured experimentally. One important aspect of regular solutions is that they follow Raoult's law, which states that the vapor pressure of a component in a mixture is proportional to its mole fraction in the solution. This means that the total vapor pressure of a mixture of two liquids is equal to the sum of the vapor pressures of each component in the mixture. Regular solutions are commonly used in the study of materials science to understand materials like alloys, polymers, and ceramics. For example, they are used to predict the melting behavior of alloys and to understand how the chemical structure of a polymer affects its properties. In conclusion, regular solutions are a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of mixtures of two liquids. They are based on the assumption that the two components have similar molecular interactions and have constant chemical potential as a function of composition.

One published win-loss record was 1895, 121-31; 1896, 143-25; 1897, 129-10; 1898, 107-10.\n\nNotable players\n\nBud Fowler \u2014 (real name is John W. Jackson; born in Cooperstown, New York in 1858) 2B and manager, 1895; was a co-founder of the team, along with Home Run Johnson. Fowler left the team in July 1895 due to a dispute with the remaining team management, consisting of white businessmen, Len W. Hoch (former Adrian mayor and the city postmaster), Augustus \"Gus\" Parsons (Hotel Emery desk clerk), and brothers Rolla and Howard Taylor (co-owners of a hardware/sporting goods store) and all Adrian businessmen. J. Wallace Page, owner of the Page Woven Wire Fence Company, sponsored the team, but the factory did not claim any of the team's profits and only used the ball club as a marketing tool for their fence company.\n\nCharlie Grant \u2014 2B, 1896-1898; nicknamed \"Cincy,\" as he hailed from Cincinnati, Ohio. Replaced Sol White as the Giants' second baseman.\n \nBilly Holland \u2014 Pitcher, OF, 1895\u201397; noted as a talented Tenor singer, who would belt out tunes during games.

Died in Battle Creek after a fight with an escaped inmate. \n\nSol White \u2014 2B, 1895; joined the Giants in June 1895, following the disbandment of his integrated Fort Wayne, Indiana, minor league team. Replaced the recently departed Bud Fowler at second base. Selected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2006 for his many years of contribution as a player, manager, executive, and black baseball reporter. His famous baseball book, published in 1907, has only a scant mention of his year on the Giants. \n\nGeorge Wilson \u2014 pitcher, 1895-1898; in 1895 split his time with the integrated Adrian Demons of the Michigan State League. Nicknamed the \"Palmyra Wonder\" after the town a few miles east of Adrian, where he was born and raised. Left-handed fireballer, who apparently pitched both overhand, but also could drop down with a submarine type delivery (\"upshoot\" pitch), Wilson was one of the top pitchers of this era. Was 29-4 with the Demons in 1895. Never married, he died in 1915 in Kalamazoo, Michigan, where he was committed in their mental health asylum. Wilson is buried with his family members in Palmyra, Michigan. \n\nGeorge Taylor, 1895-1898, 1B\n\nSherman Barton, 1898, OF and pitcher\n\nPeter Burns, 1895-1898, catcher\n\n Augustus \"Gus\" Brooks, 1895, center field.

Later was known for his award-winning penmanship. \n\nWilson, Fowler, Miller, Graham, Binga, and Burns also played games with the Adrian Demons in 1895, the town's entry into the Michigan State League, minor league. The Demons were the only integrated team in the league that season. Gus Parsons, Len Hoch, and the Taylor Brothers were the management group that operated the team in its only year of existence. Its most famous player was Honus Wagner, who played for a three-week period during July 1895 on the integrated Demons squad.\n\nFowler and Wilson left the team before the end of its first, 1895 season to play in the primarily white Michigan State League. (Riley 295, 873) Wilson posted a 29-4 record with the Adrian Demons that year and was the MSL's leading pitcher by all accounts.\n\nSources\n\nThe prose section is from the Baseball Reference Bullpen.

They played in a segregated league, the Negro Leagues, from 1895 to 1898. The team consisted of many of the best black players of that era, including Grant \"Home Run\" Johnson, Sol White, and Bud Fowler. The team was formed by a group of investors who owned the Page Woven Wire Fence Company, which was based in Adrian. The team was named after the company, and many of the players were employees of the company. The team played its games at Page's park, which was located near the company's headquarters. In their first season, the Page Fence Giants won the Michigan State Colored Baseball Championship. In 1896, they won the Western Interstate Colored Baseball Championship, which was a significant achievement at the time. The team then went on a national tour, playing against some of the top black teams in the country. One of the team's most memorable games was against the Cuban Giants in 1896. The Cuban Giants were considered one of the best black teams in the country at that time, but the Page Fence Giants defeated them 16-3. The game was seen as a major upset and helped to establish the Page Fence Giants as one of the best black teams in the nation. The team's success was short-lived, however. In 1898, the Page Fence Giants disbanded due to financial difficulties. Despite their brief existence, the team made a significant impact on the history of black baseball in America. Many of the players went on to play for other teams in the Negro Leagues, and the Page Fence Giants remain an important part of baseball history.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Claudia Ruggerini\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Claudia Ruggerini (and also known as \"Marisa\" 1 February 1922 Milan - 4 June 2016 Rome) was an Italian partisan, activist, doctor, and neuropsychiatrist. During World War II, she joined the Italian Communist Party to overthrow the government of Benito Mussolini in July 1943.\n\nEarly life and family\nClaudia Ruggerini was an Italian neuropsychiatrist, partisan, activist, and physician born in Milan, the former Italian Kingdom, in 1922. Claudia was born into a poor family in Via Padova 36, which was a street of immigrants in the 1920s. Her family was from Brianza. \nHer mother worked as a masseuse and later as a free trader, while her grandmother was a foundling. The women in Claudia\u2019s childhood are what drove and inspired her. Later in life, Claudia always credited her mother\u2019s work ethic and intelligence while looking back on her past academic and professional opportunities. Claudia\u2019s father was a part of the Italian Communist Party. \nHer father was beaten to death in 1934 by a fascists patrol in front of his house when Claudia was just twelve years old. Claudia watched her father from the window as he was horrifically beaten and left for dead.\n\nShe referred to herself as \u201ca nerd,\u201d as she was incredibly studious and had a love for the arts. This love for the arts is what precipitated her determination to bring awareness to anti-fascism. In Venice, where her Mother went to massage rich clients, Claudia went to churches, to the Biennale of art, and to see films of the film festival, which could not circulate in the fascist and provincial Italy. Claudia\u2019s rebellious nature could be seen in her character since early childhood. In Kindergarten, Claudia\u2019s teachers discovered that she was left-handed, a calamity that, at the time, needed to be \u201ccorrected.\u201d While the teachers succeeded in retraining Claudia to use her right hand, this encounter seemed to awaken the \u201crebel\u201d in her. Her rebellious, witty nature is what eventually propelled her to join the Milanese anti-fascist resistance against Benito Mussolini\n\nEducation\nWhen Claudia started high school, a teacher directed her to the humanities, and in one session, she obtained her teaching diploma in classical studies. Afterwards, Claudia began her studies at University of Industrial Chemistry, then switching her focal point to medicine in 1942. When at the university, she met Hans, who was her \"sweetheart\", and (as she would only discover after the war) had emigrated from Vienna because he was a Jew. Claudia then joined the Garibaldi Brigade, the fifth column on behalf of the CLN inside San Vittore. Hans, in fact, had been locked up there, and through a fortuitous series of events, Claudia won the trust of the Germans who ran the prison. She stated \"I was living in fear.\" Despite the fear, she did not give up, risking the worst.\nUpon studying medicine, Claudia met several anti-fascist students. In July 1943, Claudia met the leader of the Neapolitan Communist Party Antonio D'Ambrosio, one of the most respected and popular leaders of the Milanese resistance, and alongside her fellow anti-fascist peers, Claudia diligently began to fight for the cause, clearly inspired by the horrific death of her father. She was the only woman in the initiative committee, among intellectuals that the Communist D'Ambrosio, a member of the CLN (Committee for National Liberation), had set up.\n\nContributions and Communist Party activism \nClaudia joined the clandestine Communist Party of Naples. She surrounded herself with like minded young people, joining a group of artists, writers, and journalists, great architects, painters, sculptors, poets, and art critics who inspired one another through meetings to encourage passion and creativity, harbingers of new culture, and planning. Above all, the group pushed one another to never give up hope on fighting for the cause. Her peers played an important role as a source of training and cultural enrichment. Many of these great minds would become close friends of Claudia\u2019s that stuck by her throughout her lifetime, as they met throughout the Resistance and continued to inspire each other. In 1953, Claudia went as part of a delegation to visit Picasso, to convince him, which she did successfully, to grant the first major exhibition of his work held in Milan. Claudia accepted the incredibly risky tasks of underground press distribution and the delivery of weapons to the partisans of Valdossola. She was a great risk taker and extremely proactive in the Resistance, acting fearlessly by distributing underground press materials, passing messages by bicycle, delivering weapons, and stealing valuable anti-fascist intelligence from the Prison of San Vittore.\n\nPost-fascist regime \nAfter the fascist regime ended in Italy on April 25, 1947, the resistance declared a long-awaited victory, while Claudia and friends entered Milan\u2019s newsroom to memorialize the liberation of the major media.  Claudia knew Vittorini well, became a friend of Alfonso Gatto, and with them she occupied the editorial office of Corriere della Sera on April 25, to bring out the first issue of the no longer fascist newspaper. \"The last political mission,\" Claudia said, \"I made it in '53. When we went to Picasso's Cote d'Azur with D'Ambrosio and Reale, to convince him to lend Guernica to Milan for the exhibition they were dedicating to him in the Palazzo Reale. At a certain moment, Jean Cocteau also arrived. It was a wonderful day\"\nThis brand new, \u201cfree\u201d edition of the Evening Courier was published that same day.\nThe main ideals of the Resistance were the conquest of liberty, the defeat of the fascists, and the expulsion of the Germans, which were achieved. With liberation and victory assured, Claudia continued her clinical schooling, concentrating on psychoanalytic treatment in children and neuropsychiatry, as she completed her thesis entitled \u201cThe Technique of Psychoanalytic Treatment in Childhood\u201d(1949). Soon after, she met Professor Bruno Noll, who later became her husband. Afterwards, Claudia enrolled at the University of Pavia, with a specialty in Neuropsychiatry, then finishing her course of study in 1952. Claudia expressed wanting to make her contribution towards the renewal of society, as she engaged exclusively in the Public Institutions of Health. Working as a Consultant Neurologist in Milan, she worked her way up in neurology for 33 years, earning the title of Chief Neurologist at the hospital Passirana Rho in Milan.\n\nLater academic accomplishments \nClaudia became notable for her work with children, as she formulated and encouraged the revolutionary opinion that children with mental or neurological disorders could be integrated effectively into normal schools. In a 2016 interview, Claudia reflected on her experiences with children during that time. \u201cIn the clinic I was alone with the child and his relatives (even the nurse came out), I took off the white coat (always a source of fright), placed on the carpet a large box of toys and watched the child choose and play. Then I visited. Often such children were sent to \u2018special schools\u2019, which only enrolled patients with neurological or mental disorders. These were not appropriate schools for children who had an educational or cultural problem! We undertook great fights with some school principals to get the \"non-pathological\" children integrated into normal schools, yet we obtained excellent results.\u201d Upon her retirement in 1987, Claudia was awarded the title of \u201cEmeritus Chief of Neurology,\u201d and continued her work at the hospital as a volunteer for ten years. She continuously stated her belief that the profession was to be a \u201cservice\u201d to the community.\n\nEnd of life contributions and activism \nClaudia felt a personal commitment to serve her community, forever grateful for the opportunities afforded her and humbled by the experience of living under fascism. In 1988, Claudia and her friend Anna Mancini organized a non-profit known as the \u201cTreviso Advar Foundation,\u201d providing at-home care for terminally ill cancer patients, alongside nursing and medical teams, in addition to training of volunteers. The organization created a warm and welcoming \u201chospice\u201d house with cultural activities for everyone, including the patients. Claudia knew how it felt to be oppressed and to lack freedom, hence why she continued her activism throughout generations. When asked, late in her life, about her role as a freedom fighter, she said, \u201cI know very well what it means not to have freedom (of opinion, of the press, of religion, of movement, etc.), to conquer it and to respect it. It is different for the new generations, who often confuse freedom with license. It is up to adults, even the media, to educate!\u201d Her life was truly one of great sacrifice, risk, determination, love, and kindness. \nClaudia Ruggerini passed away peacefully from natural causes in Rome, Italy, on June 4, 2016.\n\nReferences \n\n1922 births\n2016 deaths\nItalian resistance movement members\nItalian anti-fascists\nItalian psychiatrists\nFemale anti-fascists", "machine_text": "Claudia Ruggerini is an Italian former athlete and Olympic gold medalist.

Kalki's birthday is observed on the Dwadashi of the Shuklapaksha of the Bhadrapada month as per the traditional Hindu calendar, while in Gregorian calendar it is the twelfth day of the waxing phase of the moon. It is said to be celebrated on August 3, 2022 and August 22, 2023. This festival is mainly celebrated by the Vaishnavas of the Vaishnavism tradition in Hinduism.\n\nSignificance \n\nKalki is said to be born in the village of Shambala, to a Brahmin family, whose parents are Vishnuyasha (father) and Sumati (mother). This event commences at the end of Kali Yuga, which is described that when Kalki grows up and becomes a warrior, he rides a Divine white horse named Devadatta with a blazing sword, accompanied by a talking parrot, Shuka, who knows everything; the past, present and future. He then goes around the world to fight evil kingdoms and especially Kali, who is a demon that has the powers of a yogi to control beings and makes them commit Adharma. He then restores Dharma and returns to his homeland, heaven or Vaikuntha.\n\nCelebration \nDuring the festival, the devotees wake up early in the morning, take a bath before sunrise, fast and recite the Vishnu Stotram, either in the temple or at home. At home, they recite the Narayana Mantra and other mantras 108 times. The performance of the pooja (worship) starts with the Beej mantra, where then an offering of a seat to the Lord (asana) takes place, whereby in the further process, the idol is washed spiritually with water and panchamrita, with the offering of flowers, diya and incense.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Ski boot\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Ski boots are footwear used in skiing to provide a way to attach the skier to skis using ski bindings. The ski/boot/binding combination is used to effectively transmit control inputs from the skier's legs to the snow.\n\nHistory\n\nSki boots were leather winter boots, held to the ski with leather straps. As skiing became more specialized, so too did ski boots, leading to the splitting of designs between those for alpine skiing and cross-country skiing.\n\nModern skiing developed as an all-round sport with uphill, downhill and cross-country portions. The introduction of the cable binding started a parallel evolution of binding and boot. The binding looped a strap around the back of the boot to hold it forward into a metal cup at the toe. Boots with the sole extended rearward to produce a flange for the cable to firmly latch to become common, as did designs with semi-circular indentations on the heel for the same purpose.\n\nEffective cross-country skiing requires the boot to flex forward to allow a striding action, so the boots were designed around a sole piece that allowed forward flexing while still keeping the foot relatively firm side-to-side. The upper portions, the cuff, was relatively soft, designed primarily for comfort and warmth. Modern cross-country ski boots remain almost unchanged since 1950s, although modern materials have replaced leather and other natural fibres.\n\nWith the introduction of ski lifts, the need for skiing to get to the top of the hill was eliminated, and a much stiffer design was preferred, providing better control over the ski when sliding downhill. A key development was the invention in 1928 of the Kandahar cable binding, which attached the heel solidly to the ski and used a strong spring to pull the boot forward into the toe iron. The design required a stiffer, reinforced boot sole, often build on a wooden shank. New boots that had been boiled in oil or soaked in glue were introduced to stiffen the upper cuff. These were universally uncomfortable, especially during the break-in period when they were new. Once broken-in, they wore out quickly as they continued to soften up. Racers typically had only weeks to wear a particular pair before it was no longer useful. Another attempt to stiffen the leg/ski connection was the \"long thong\", a long leather strap fixed directly to the ski that was wrapped several times around the lower leg and then buckled closed. This offered a great improvement in control, but increased the risk of injury in the event of an accident.\n\nAlpine\n\nModern alpine ski boots have rigid soles and attach to the ski at both toe and heel using a spring-loaded binding. The interface between boot and binding is standardized by ISO 5355, which defines the size and shape of the hard plastic flanges on the toe and heel of the boot. Ski boots are sized using the Mondopoint system.\n\nFront-entry\nFront-entry (or \"top-entry\", rarely \"overlap\" or \"Lange\") boots have been the primary boot design for most of the history of downhill skiing. The design evolved from existing leather boot through several steps.\n\nIn 1956, the Swiss factory Henke introduced the buckle boot, using over-center levered latches patented by Hans Martin to replace laces. Laces spread the load across a number of eyelets in the leather, whereas the buckles concentrated the load at only a few points. To spread it back out again, the boots featured C-shaped flaps that stretched over the opening where the laces would be, to the side where the buckles were located. These had the added advantage of also helping block snow from entering the front of the boot.\n\nBeginning around 1960 Bob Lange experimented with ways to replace leather with plastic. Early examples used a lace-up design, but in 1964 he combined a new, more flexible polyurethane plastic with the overlapping flap and buckle system from Henke to produce the first recognizably modern ski boot. Production examples appeared in 1966, and when Nancy Greene started winning races on them, the plastic boot became a must-have item. Replacing leather with plastic dramatically improved stiffness and control, along with durability and warmth (leather boots had a way of soaking through, which led to wet, frozen feet). Over time the cuff around the leg evolved upward, starting just over the ankle like leather boots, but rising to a point about half way to the knee by the 1980s. Only minor changes have occurred to this basic design since then.\n\nAlmost all modern front-entry boots consist of two sections, one around the foot, and another around the lower leg. These are joined by rivets/rotating joints near the ankle that allows the leg to pivot forward, but not to the sides. This allows excellent control by transmitting even the smallest lateral movements of the leg to the ski. However, the rigid cuff also makes them very difficult to put on and take off. Additionally, because the boot clamps across the foot, pulling the sides inward, it is difficult to produce a single design that fits a range of foot shapes and sizes. This leads to shell modification services, when the boot is stretched to fit the skier's foot, typically by heating the plastic and pressing it into place. This is also known as \"blowing\" (\"punching\", \"pushing\"). Sometimes material will be ground off the boot to provide more room. This is normally used only with front-entry designs, other designs normally include much more room in the foot area as they do not clamp down the same way.\n\nRear-entry\nRear-entry boots were brought to market in the early 1970s by the Hanson brothers to address the issue of getting conventional boots on and off, while also providing a generally better fit. Rear-entry designs were very popular in the 1980s, notably Salomon designs like the racing-oriented SX 91 Equipe.\n\nIn the rear-entry design, the entire foot area and sole are a single unit similar to a slipper. The leg cuff is split in two, with front and rear sections that meet at the hinge point at the ankle. The rear half of the cuff can pivot far to the rear, opening wide for easy entry. Closing a cable locks the moving rear portion forward onto the front half, forming the stiff cuff that pivots around rivets at the ankle like a conventional front-entry design. As the toe area is a single piece and lacks buckles for adjustment, rear-entry boots may have considerable \"slop\", and various systems of cables, plates or foam-filled bladders were used to address this. The upside of this approach is that the foot area can be made larger, fitting almost any foot.\n\nThe rear entry design fell from popularity in the 1990s due to their shunning by racers in search of a closer fit. Recent improvements to front-entry and mid-entry boots, primarily in the areas of comfort and ease of entry/exit, have diminished the popularity of rear-entry designs even in recreational roles, though mid-range models remain common as rental boots.\n\nThree-piece\nThree-piece (or \"open-throat\") boots were first developed by Mel Dalebout (around 1969), who introduced a rigid magnesium boot shell in that year (Brixia did the same thing with their aluminum shell at around the same time). The big advantage was that the main shell was a single piece that was convex at all points, meaning it could be easily produced using a plug mould. Conventional boots with overlapping flaps required more complex moulding processes. Engineers at Henke, Heierling, Sanmarco and Caber saw the advantage for high-speed moulding, and plastic three-piece boots were on the market by 1972, when Roland Collombin won the Olympic downhill in the Henke Strato.\n\nBoot designer Sven Coomer later improved the design with a corrugated tongue, and this technique was commercialized by Comfort Products, an Aspen, Colo. company owned by the ex-ski racer Erik Giese. Giese licensed Coomer's concept to the Swiss company Raichle-Molitor; the company introduced it in 1979 as the Flexon, which became very popular among downhill racers and mogul skiers. The Flexon was extremely popular among professional skiers, especially for moguls and freestyle, but a series of business blunders put Raichle out of business in the late 1990s. Several companies produce three-piece designs today, often referred to as \"cabrio\" boots (after convertible-top cabriolet vehicles), and they are once again becoming popular models.\n\nThe design closely resembles a conventional front-entry design, with separate foot and leg sections riveted at the ankle. However, the overlapping flaps of these designs are cut away, leaving a slot-like opening running down the front of the leg and over the foot. A separate plastic tongue is positioned over this opening on the front of the boot, and buckled down to close it. The open cuff (the \"throat\") makes the boots easy to get on and off, and the shaping of the tongue allows complete control over the forward flex. A single shell can be used with different tongues to provide any needed flex pattern from racing-stiff to freestyle-soft.\n\nHybrid leather\nThe introduction of plastic boots in the 1960s led a number of companies to introduce \"hybrid\" boots with plastic inserts for additional lateral strength. These were widespread in the late 1960s, especially from the large collection of Italian bookmakers in Montebelluna, before they started introducing all-plastic designs of their own. Typical designs used a plastic insert wrapping around the heel area and extending up to just below the ankle, allowing the skier to force their foot sideways and offering some edging control. Others, notably 1968's Raichle Fibre Jet, wrapped a soft leather boot in an external fibreglass shell, producing a side-entry design that was not particularly successful. Hybrid designs often incorporated elements of the side-entry or three-piece designs. The Fibre Jet shared much in common with the Rosemount design, for instance.\n\nSide-entry\nIntroduced by Rosemount in 1965, side-entry design consisted of an almost completely enclosed shell with a cut-out section on one side. The cut-out was covered by a flap that hinged along the back of the boot, swinging to the rear to open. Stepping in was very easy, simply sliding the foot sideways in through the opening, then swinging the flap closed and stretching a fabric cover over it to seal it. As the upper and lower sections both opened, metal plates were needed on the sides to connect the two mechanically. A problem was that the boot did not meet perfectly along the join, allowing snow to force its way into the boot, although improvements were continuous. This design fell from use in the 1970s as higher-cuff front-entry boots became largely universal.\n\nExternal frames\nThe ski boot provides four functions; protecting the foot from the elements, providing a mounting point for the binding, and transmitting forces between the leg and the ski. In theory, there's no reason these have to be combined in a single unit, and several designs have split these functions up. One example is the Nava System from the 1980s, which used a soft boot that clipped into custom bindings, and an arm that extended up from the rear binding to wrap around the leg and provide lateral control.\n\nKnee-highs\nIn 1980 four designs were introduced that all rose to a point just under the knee. They were normal ski boots below, but used an extended tongue that fastened around the upper leg using a variety of methods. They offered much greater edging control, and were quickly copied by many other companies. They all disappeared by 1983, a victim largely of fashion - ski pants wouldn't fit over them. None are produced today.\n\nNordic\n\nCross-country and telemark\nCross-country boots, like all Nordic equipment, attach to the ski usually only at the toe of the boot and are allowed to flex at the ball of the foot similarly to a normal shoe or boot. Cross-country boots generally use one of four attachment systems; NNN (New Nordic Norm), 75mm Nordic Norm (\"three-pin\" binding, \"75NN\"), d-ring, or SNS (Salomon Nordic System). A four-pin binding system similar to 75NN used to be popular in the USSR. A new Salomon Pilot binding is now widely used for racing because it uses two connection points so that the skier has more stability and control over the ski. As these boots are intended for travel over generally flat terrain, they are optimized for light weight and efficiency of motion.\n\nTelemark refers to a specific technique for making downhill turns on Nordic equipment. This has resulted in highly specialized equipment designed for better performance in a downhill setting. Until 1992 Telemark boots were basically heavy leather boots with the front of the sole adapted to the 75mm Nordic Norm. The introduction of the New Telemark Norm (NTN) binding in 2007 change the technique dramatically. Since then plastic boots have become more and more common and now make up almost all Telemark boots. Plastic allows for a laterally stiffer boot while still allowing freedom of flex at the ball of the foot through the use of bellows. Boots intended for more cross country travel generally have a lower cuff, softer flex and lighter weight. Boots specialized for downhill use have higher cuffs, stiffer flex and heavier weight. Telemark boots are almost always equipped with a rubber sole.\n\nAlpine touring\n\nAlthough randonn\u00e9e is considered as an alpine sport, it basically combines the cross-country stride for uphill portions and then conventional alpine techniques on the downhill. The equipment uses most closely compares to modern telemark systems, with a stiff plastic boot offering good downhill control, and a binding system that allows it to pivot at the toe for cross-country striding. Different models trade off light weight against downhill performance. They have a rockered, rubber sole to allow for easier walking. This means that they will not fit in ordinary alpine bindings. Instead, the interface between alpine touring boots and bindings is defined by ISO 9523. Other attachment methods exist and prominent amongst these are the Tech bindings and fittings that were first commercialized by Dynafit as the TLT. As yet, these are not covered by an international standard.\n\nSnowboarding\n\nDownhill techniques, alpine, telemark and snowboarding, all perform turns by rotating the ski or board onto its edge. Once on edge, the curved pattern cut into the side (the \"sidecut\") causes the ski or board to bend into a curve. As they move forward over the snow, this curved shape causes them to turn.\n\nSnowboard boots and bindings are normally far simpler than their downhill counterparts, rarely including release systems for instance, and need to provide mechanical support only in the fore and aft directions. These typically consist of an external frame, generally L shaped, which the snowboarder steps into and then fastens down using straps over the boot. The boot itself is not as responsible for transmitting forces, and can be much softer than a typical downhill boot. When the sport was first introduced, normal winter boots were used, but today it is much more common to use semi-stiff snowboarding boots. Some specialty disciplines use harder boots with step-in bindings more similar to downhill systems, but these are not widely used outside these fields, even though some downhill sports teachers use these so they can switch between snowboarding or skiing classes without having to change boots.\n\nSee also\nSki binding\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n \nBoots\nSports footwear\nBoot", "machine_text": "Ski boots are specialized footwear designed to provide support, stability, and flexibility when skiing. It is a crucial gear for all skiers, from professionals to beginners, as it is the link between the skier's feet and their skis. The importance of choosing the right ski boots cannot be overstated as the right boots can significantly enhance performance and comfort. Construction Ski boots are typically made of plastic or a combination of plastic and other materials, such as rubber, leather, and foam. The inner liner of the boots is generally made of a combination of materials like foam, felt, and other synthetic materials. This combination ensures that the ski boots are firm and flexible in all the right places, providing support where needed. Features Ski boots feature different types of buckles, straps, and laces to help keep the boots firmly secured onto the feet. They also have a range of adjustment options that allow skiers to fine-tune the fit of the boots and adjust the flex index, which determines the boots' stiffness. The bourrelet located at the top of the boot can be different sizes and heights, which helps to support the lower leg and provide increased adherence to the boot. Types of ski boots There are mainly three types of ski boots: Alpine skiing boots, Nordic skiing boots, and Freestyle skiing boots. Alpine skiing boots come in two varieties, which are front-entry and rear-entry boots. Front-entry boots have a wide mouth and are easier to slip on and off, while rear-entry boots have a smaller opening in the back, making them more challenging to put on. Nordic skiing boots are used in cross-country skiing, and they are more flexible, lighter, and comfortable. Freestyle skiing boots are designed to provide more agility and flexibility in the terrain park, as they need to allow for more movement around the ankle. Conclusion Ski boots are an essential investment for any skier, and choosing the right boots can improve performance and enhance the skiing experience significantly. Skiers should always ensure that they choose the appropriate boots for their skill level and skiing preferences to get the most out of their time on the slopes.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 335207}

This migration increased in 1917 with the enactment of the Jones-Shafroth Act, which granted U.S. citizenship to all Puerto Ricans, and especially in the 1940s and 1950s.\n\nSee also\nNuyorican\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links", "machine_text": "Hispanics and Latinos in New York refer to the population of people who identify as Hispanic or Latino and live in the state of New York. This group of people is diverse and includes individuals from various countries, such as Mexico, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Dominican Republic, and others. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Hispanics and Latinos make up around 19% of New York's population, with a total of over 3 million people. This makes the state the fourth-largest Hispanic and Latino population in the country, after California, Texas, and Florida. The history of Hispanics and Latinos in New York dates back to the 19th century when Puerto Ricans began to migrate to the city. The migration increased significantly after World War II due to economic opportunities and political instability in Puerto Rico. In the following decades, other Hispanic and Latino groups also migrated to New York, including Dominicans, Mexicans, Colombians, Ecuadorians, and Peruvians. Today, New York City is home to the largest Hispanic and Latino population in the state. The neighborhoods of East Harlem, Washington Heights, and the South Bronx are commonly known as \"El Barrio\" and have large Puerto Rican, Dominican, and Mexican communities. Other neighborhoods such as Jackson Heights and Corona in Queens have vibrant Ecuadorian and Colombian communities. The Hispanic and Latino population in New York has contributed to the city's diversity and cultural richness. Hispanic and Latino influences can be seen in the city's food, music, art, and traditions. The community also plays an important role in the city's economy, with many business owners and workers. Despite their contributions, Hispanics and Latinos in New York face various challenges, including discrimination, poverty, and access to education and healthcare. However, organizations such as the Hispanic Federation and the National Association of Latino Arts and Cultures work to address these issues and empower the Hispanic and Latino community. In conclusion, Hispanics and Latinos in New York have a rich history and culture and continue to play an important role in the city's identity and economy. While facing challenges, the community remains resilient and works towards achieving greater social and economic equity.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 46789386}

In English it is sometimes known as the  common funnel.\n\nNaming\nThis species was originally described by the mycologist Christiaan Hendrik Persoon in 1801 as Agaricus gibbus, at a time when gilled mushrooms were generally all assigned to genus Agaricus.  Then in 1871 in his guide to mycology (\"Der F\u00fchrer in die Pilzkunde\"),  Paul Kummer allocated the species to the genus Clitocybe, which previously (according to the system of Fries) had only been a tribe within genus Agaricus.\n\nIn 2003 Harri Harmaja created the new genus Infundibulicybe for some of the larger members of the former Clitocybe and he included Infundibulicybe gibba as the type species.  A couple of authorities still keep it in genus Clitocybe, however.\n\nThe older name Clitocybe infundibuliformis is often identified as a synonym of I. gibba, but according to Species Fungorum that use was incorrect and the original C. infundibuliformis was a different mushroom.\n\nThe epithet gibba comes from the Latin adjective \"gibbus\", meaning \"humped\" or \"gibbous\".  The name infundibuliformis derives from the Latin \"infundibulum\", a funnel, with the suffix \"-formis\" - so it means \"funnel-shaped\".\n\nDescription\nThis section uses the given references throughout.\n\nThe matt slightly felted cap grows from about 3\u00a0cm to 9\u00a0cm, and is beige to tan, also sometimes with a pink tinge. It soon becomes funnel-shaped but often has a small bulge (an \"umbo\") in the centre.\nThere is no ring or other veil remnant. The stem is white or whitish and about 2\u20138\u00a0cm long and 1\u00a0cm in diameter.\nThe white gills are crowded and very decurrent (running down the stem).\nIt has a faint \"cyanic\" smell, like new-mown hay, and the taste is mild.  However, there is also a central European variety \"adstringens\" which has an unpleasant taste.\nThe tear-shaped spores are white and around 5.5\u20138\u00a0\u00b5m by 4\u20135\u00a0\u00b5m.\n\nDistribution, habitat, ecology and human impact\nThis gregarious saprobic mushroom grows on soil in deciduous or (less commonly) coniferous woods and may be found from summer to autumn.  It sometimes forms fairy rings.\n\nIt is very common throughout Europe, and occurs in North America and Japan.\n\nIt is edible when young, but said to be of mediocre quality. It can be fried or used in risottos or soups etc. The stems are tough and may be discarded. The species resembles some which are poisonous.\n\nAn extract of I. gibba exhibits inhibitory activity on thrombin.\n\nSimilar species\nThe species resembles Infundibulicybe squamulosa and Pseudoclitocybe cyathiformis.\n\nReferences\n\nTricholomataceae\nEdible fungi\nFungi described in 1801\nFungi of Europe\nTaxa named by Christiaan Hendrik Persoon", "machine_text": "Infundibulicybe gibba, commonly known as the snow cap mushroom, is a species of mushroom belonging to the family Strophariaceae. It is a small, saprotrophic mushroom that grows on the ground in deciduous and coniferous forests, often in dense clusters. The cap of Infundibulicybe gibba is bell-shaped, with a diameter of 5-15 mm. The cap is initially white, but turns greyish-brown with age. The stem is slender and cylindrical, measuring 5-20mm in length and 1-2mm in thickness. Its colour is typically a pale grey or white and covered with fine white hairs. The underside of the cap features gills with a light to dark brown colour, ultimately turning dark brown or nearly black as the mushroom matures. Infundibulicybe gibba is found throughout North America, Europe, and Asia. In North America, it is typically found in colder regions such as Canada and Alaska. It is known to grow on wet soils in late fall to early winter. Infundibulicybe gibba is generally considered non-toxic but not typically harvested for consumption due to its small size and lack of true taste. It is not known for any medicinal properties, however, there is interest in field research on the species' ability to break down plant matter to extract nutrients. Recent studies have found that Infundibulicybe gibba may be useful in reducing the occurrence of plant pathogenic diseases. Specifically, the fungus appears to be able to reduce the incidence of root rot in pine seedlings. In conclusion, Infundibulicybe gibba is an interesting species of mushroom that can be found throughout northern regions in Asia, Europe, and North America. While its primary use is as an ecological indicator, there are intriguing possibilities of its medicinal and agriculturally protective properties.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 61385952}

The wings have a distinctive pattern consisting of wavy lines and spots outlined in black. Females typically have wings that are larger and more robust than males. The moth is active during the spring months, from March to May, and can be found in a variety of habitats that provide the necessary food sources for their larvae. These habitats include woodlands, meadows, fields, and gardens. The larvae of the spring pink moth are green and feed on the leaves of various trees and shrubs, such as cherry, apple, and dogwood. The larvae also have the ability to camouflage themselves by mimicking leaves and twigs to avoid being detected by predators. The spring pink moth is not considered a pest, although its larvae may occasionally cause minor damage to trees and shrubs. However, the moth does serve as an important food source for many bird species, including woodpeckers and chickadees.

The library currently functions as an additional reading room for the Bodleian Library.\n\nHistory\n\nDuke Humfrey's Library is named after Humphrey of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Gloucester, a younger son of Henry IV of England. He was a connoisseur of literature and commissioned translations of classical works from Greek into Latin. When he died in 1447, he donated his collection of 281 books to the University of Oxford. At the time, this was considered an incredibly generous donation as the university only had 20 books. All classes at that time were taught via oral lectures; books were handwritten and were only for the extremely wealthy. \n\nThe library was constructed as a second storey to the Divinity School between 1450 and 1480 in order to house the donated collection. In 1550, during the Reformation, the King's Commissioners despoiled the library of books in order to destroy the vestiges of Roman Catholicism in the country. The books were probably burnt, and in 1556 the furniture was removed by the university. Today, only three of Humfrey's original books remain in the library.\n\nThe Library was refitted and restored from 1598 by Sir Thomas Bodley and between 1610 and 1612, the east wing (now the Arts End) was added. The west wing (now the Selden End) was built 20 years later. The books in the oldest part are accommodated in oak bookcases which are at right angles to the walls on either side with integral readers' desks. The ceiling consists of panels painted with the arms of the university.

When any ant made a little circuit away from the main body, a fly would generally pursue it at a distance of about half an inch, but back away as soon as the ant turned towards it. ... Eventually Lamborn saw a fly stalk a minor ant carrying a pupa in its jaws. Suddenly the fly rushed forward and apparently pierced the pupa bringing the ant up with a sharp jerk. The two insects then had a tug of war with very little advantage to either side, until the ant apparently became annoyed and letting go of the pupa rushed at the fly, which escaped with the booty which it proceeded to suck. Then he saw a fly swoop down on the ant column and rise at once with a pupa and attendant ant, both of which it dropped after carrying them for about a foot. The ant, however, still held on and started to run off with its charge. The fly caught it again and this time rose three feet in the air and then dropped ant and pupa again. This time the ant left the pupa which the fly immediately seized and proceeded to suck.\u201d\n\nSpecies\n\nBengalia africana Malloch, 1927\nBengalia africanoides Rognes\nBengalia akamanga (Lehrer)\nBengalia aliena Malloch, 1927\nBengalia asymmetria Kurahashi & Tumrasvin, 1979\nBengalia bantuphalla (Lehrer)\nBengalia bezzii Senior-White, 1923\nBengalia calilungae Rueda, 1985\nBengalia chekiangensis Fan\nBengalia chiangmaiensis Kurahashi & Tumrasvin, 1979\nBengalia chromatella S\u00e9guy, 1946\nBengalia concava Malloch, 1927\nBengalia cuthbertsoni Zumpt, 1956 \nBengalia depressa Walker, 1858\nBengalia emarginata Malloch\nBengalia emarginatoides Rognes\nBengalia emdeniella (Lehrer)\nBengalia escheri Bezzi, 1913\nBengalia fani Feng & Wei\nBengalia favillacea (Walker)\nBengalia fernandiella Lehrer\nBengalia floccosa Wulp\nBengalia fuscipennis Bezzi, 1913\nBengalia gaillardi Sourcouf & Guyon, 1912 - Synonyms:B. spurca Brauer & Bergenstamm, 1891, B. spurca Villeneuve, 1914\nBengalia gigas Macquart\nBengalia hastativentris Senior-White, 1923\nBengalia hobbyi Senior-White, 1940\nBengalia inermis Malloch, 1927\nBengalia jejuna Fabricius\nBengalia kanoi Kurahashi & Magpayo, 2000\nBengalia kuyanianus Matsumura\nBengalia labiata Robineau-Desvoidy, 1830\nBengalia lampunia Lehrer\nBengalia lateralis Macquart\nBengalia latro Meijere\nBengalia lyneborgi James, 1966\nBengalia martinleakei Senior-White, 1930\nBengalia minor Malloch, 1927\nBengalia nirvanella Lehrer\nBengalia pallidicoxa Senior-White, 1946\nBengalia peuhi Villeneuve, 1914\nBengalia pseudovaricolor Kurahashi & Tumrasvin, 1979\nBengalia pygomalaya Lehrer\nBengalia racovitzai (Lehrer)\nBengalia recurva Malloch, 1927\nBengalia robertsi Kurahashi, 1987\nBengalia roubaudi Rickenbach, Hamon & Mochet, 1960\nBengalia semerunia Lehrer\nBengalia seniorwhitei (Lehrer)\nBengalia siamensis Senior-White, 1924\nBengalia smarti (Lehrer)\nBengalia spinifemorata Villeneuve, 1913\nBengalia subnitida James, 1964\nBengalia surcoufi Senior-White, 1923\nBengalia taiwanensis Fan, 1965\nBengalia taksina (Lehrer)\nBengalia tibiaria Villeneuve, 1926\nBengalia torosa Wiedemann\nBengalia unicolor Senior-White, 1946\nBengalia varicolor Fabricius, 1805\nBengalia wangariae (Lehrer)\nBengalia weii Rognes\nBengalia wyatti (Lehrer)\nBengalia xanthopyga Senior-White, 1924\nBengalia zhangi (Lehrer & Wei)\n\nTaxonomic dispute\nThe genus was reclassified into 11 new genera in 4 subfamilies by Andy Lehrer in 2005, within a newly designated family, Bengaliidae. The family designation was disputed by Rognes (2006) who noted that it was equivalent to the already established tribe Bengaliini (now the subfamily Bengaliinae), and that treating it as a family renders the Calliphoridae paraphyletic.  Further Rognes considers all the new genera created as junior names for Bengalia. Lehrer's work adds 49 species to the already described 41 species and 18 of these new species are treated as invalid by Rognes. At present, major sources of Dipteran taxonomy do not recognize Lehrer's 10 new genera as valid, nor the 18 new species treated as invalid by Rognes (e.g.). Additional names published by Lehrer have since been synonymized, with 120 new synonymies established in a single review in 2020.\n\nThis dispute reflects that at present, there is no consensus as to the best way to subdivide the Calliphoridae, which many authorities acknowledge is not a natural group (in this case, polyphyletic); the BioSystematic Database of World Diptera, for example, states \"The Calliphoridae are marked as a polyphyletic group of convenience as at the present we are unwilling to reduce the Oestridae to a subordinated group within a monophyletic Calliphoridae nor to elevate a number of other groups (Polleniidae, Helicoboscidae, and Bengaliidae) so as to properly delimit both Calliphoridae and Oestridae.\" Similarly, the dispute at the generic level is that some of Lehrer's genera are paraphyletic, and, additionally, that they are based largely or exclusively upon features of the male genitalia, and it is therefore impossible to identify most female specimens to subfamily, let alone genus (the rejection of Lehrer's subdivisions therefore being both taxonomic and a matter of practicality). The dispute at the species level centers on the fact that Lehrer did not include or examine 24 of the 41 known species in his revision, so of the 31 species he validly described that were not immediately synonymized, many could still potentially be synonyms of these 24 excluded species.\n\nReferences\n\nCalliphoridae\nOestroidea genera\nTaxa named by Jean-Baptiste Robineau-Desvoidy", "machine_text": "Bengalia is a genus of small flowering plants in the family Fabaceae, native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. The plants are typically woody shrubs or climbers, with compound leaves and pea-like flowers in shades of red, pink, or purple. The genus was first described in 1837 by the British botanist John Lindley and is currently classified in the subfamily Caesalpinioideae. Bengalia species have a wide variety of uses in traditional medicine, as their bark, leaves, and roots contain a range of active compounds with anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and anticancer properties. In East Asia, the root of Bengalia striata is used in the treatment of liver and spleen disorders, as well as to improve blood circulation and ease menstrual pain. In Africa, the leaves of Bengalia subsessilis are used in a tea to treat malaria, while the bark of Bengalia senegalensis is used to alleviate toothache and rheumatic pain. Bengalia plants are also valued in horticulture for their attractive foliage and showy blooms. Bengalia gentryi, native to Ecuador and Colombia, is a popular species in cultivation for its bright red flowers and glossy green leaves. Bengalia racemifera, a native of Southeast Asia, is prized for its ornamental value as a climbing vine that can reach up to 15 meters in height. Several Bengalia species are also used as an ornamental plant in traditional Chinese gardens. The taxonomy of Bengalia is complex, with many species having undergone multiple name changes and reclassifications over the years. As of 2021, the genus contains around 50 recognized species, though further taxonomic research is needed to fully clarify its phylogeny and distribution. Despite this, Bengalia plants remain an important cultural and ecological resource in many parts of the world, and are an intriguing subject for both scientific and aesthetic study.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 8887164}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Protesilaus\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "In Greek mythology, Protesilaus (; Ancient Greek: \u03a0\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03b5\u03c3\u03af\u03bb\u1fb1\u03bf\u03c2 Pr\u014dtesil\u0101os) was a hero in the Iliad who was venerated at cult sites in Thessaly and Thrace. Protesilaus was the son of Iphiclus, a \"lord of many sheep\"; as grandson of the eponymous Phylacos, he was the leader of the Phylaceans. Hyginus surmised that he was originally known as Iolaus\u2014not to be confused with Iolaus, the nephew of Heracles\u2014but was referred to as \"Protesilaus\" after being the first (, protos) to leap ashore at Troy, and thus the first to die in the war.\n\nTrojan War\nProtesilaus was one of the suitors of Helen. He brought forty black ships with him to Troy, drawing his men from \"flowering\" Pyrasus, coastal Antron and Pteleus, \"deep in grass\", in addition to his native Phylace. Protesilaus was the first to land: \"the first man who dared to leap ashore when the Greek fleet touched the Troad\", Pausanias recalled, quoting the author of the epic called the Cypria.  An oracle had prophesied that the first Greek to walk on the land after stepping off a ship in the Trojan War would be the first to die, and so, after killing four men, he was himself slain by Hector. Alternate sources have him slain by either Aeneas, Euphorbus, Achates, or Cycnus.   After Protesilaus' death, his brother, Podarces, joined the war in his place. The gods had pity on his widow, Laodamia, daughter of Acastus, and brought him up from Hades to see her. She was at first overjoyed, thinking he had returned from Troy, but after the gods returned him to the underworld, she found the loss unbearable.  She had a bronze statue of her late husband constructed, and devoted herself to it. After her worried father had witnessed her behavior, he had it destroyed; however, Laodamia jumped into the fire with it. Another source claims his wife was Polydora, daughter of Meleager.\n\nAccording to legend, the Nymphs planted elms on the tomb, in the Thracian Chersonese, of \"great-hearted Protesilaus\" (\u00ab\u03bc\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03b8\u03c5\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u03a0\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03ac\u03bf\u03c5\u00bb), elms that grew to be the tallest in the known world; but when their topmost branches saw far off the ruins of Troy, they immediately withered, so great still was the bitterness of the hero buried below.  The story is the subject of a poem by Antiphilus of Byzantium (1st century A.D.) in the Palatine Anthology:\n\nCult of Protesilaus\nOnly two sanctuaries to Protesilaus are attested. There was a shrine of Protesilaus at Phylace, his home in Thessaly, where his widow was left lacerating her cheeks in mourning him, and games were organised there in his honour, Pindar noted. The tomb of Protesilaus at Elaeus in the Thracian Chersonese is documented in the 5th century BCE, when, during the Persian War, votive treasure deposited at his tomb was plundered by the satrap Artayctes, under permission from Xerxes. The Greeks later captured and executed Artayctes, returning the treasure. The tomb was mentioned again when Alexander the Great arrived at Elaeus on his campaign against the Persian Empire. He offered a sacrifice on the tomb, hoping to avoid the fate of Protesilaus when he arrived in Asia.  Like Protesilaus before him, Alexander was the first to set foot on Asian soil during his campaign. Philostratus writing of this temple in the early 3rd century CE, speaks of a cult statue of Protesilaus at this temple \"standing on a base which was shaped like the prow of a boat;\" Gisela Richter noted coins of Elaeus from the time of Commodus that show on their reverses Protesilaus on the prow of a ship, in helmet, cuirass and short chiton. Strabo, also mention the sanctuary.\n \nA founder-cult of Protesilaus at Scione, in Pallene, Chalcidice, was given an etiology by the Greek grammarian and mythographer of the Augustan-era Conon that is at variance with the epic tradition. In this, Conon asserts that Protesilaus survived the Trojan War and was returning with Priam's sister Aethilla as his captive. When the ships put ashore for water on the coast of Pallene, between Scione and Mende, Aethilla persuaded the other Trojan women to burn the ships, forcing Protesilaus to remain and found the city of Scione. A rare tetradrachm of Scione ca. 480 BCE acquired by the British Museum depicts Protesilaus, identified by the retrograde legend PROTESLAS.\n\nProtesilaus, speaking from beyond the grave, is the oracular source of the corrected eye-witness version of the actions of heroes at Troy, related by a \"vine-dresser\" to a Phoenician merchant in the framing device that gives an air of authenticity to the narratives of Philostratus' Heroicus, a late literary representation of Greek hero-cult traditions that developed independently of the epic tradition.\n\nCultural depictions\nAmong very few representations of Protesilaus, a sculpture by Deinomenes is just a passing mention in Pliny's Natural History; the outstanding surviving examples are two Roman copies of a lost mid-fifth century Greek bronze original represent Protesilaus at his defining moment, one of them in a torso the British Museum, the other at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The Metropolitan's sculpture of a heroically nude helmeted warrior stands on a forward-slanting base, looking down and slightly to his left, with his right arm raised, prepared to strike, would not be identifiable, save by comparison made by Gisela Richter with a torso of the same model and its associated slanting base, schematically carved as the prow of a ship encircled by waves: Protesilaus about to jump ashore.\n\nIf Euripides' tragedy, Protesilaos, had survived, his name would be more familiar today.\n\nThe poem in the Palatine Anthology (VII.141) on Protesilaus by Antiphilus of Byzantium in turn inspired F.

He was the son of the king of Phylace, Iphiclus, and was known for his bravery and skill in battle. According to legend, Protesilaus was the first Greek to set foot on Trojan soil, which earned him great respect from his fellow warriors. However, his bravery also led to his downfall. During the Trojan War, Protesilaus was killed by Hector, the Trojan prince, during the first battle. This act was seen as a great tragedy for the Greeks, as Protesilaus was known as a great hero and leader. After Protesilaus's death, his wife Laodamia was grief-stricken and begged the gods to bring him back to life. The gods relented, but only allowed Protesilaus to return to the world of the living for three hours. Laodamia spent this time with her husband, but when the time was up, Protesilaus was forced to return to the Underworld. The story of Protesilaus has been the subject of many works of art and literature, including the ancient Greek tragedies Ajax by Sophocles and Iphigenia at Aulis by Euripides. His name has also been used as a symbol of sacrifice and bravery, and is often cited as an example of the dangerous allure of heroism. In modern times, Protesilaus's legacy continues to inspire people. A planet in our solar system, discovered in 1989, has been named after him. Additionally, the story of Protesilaus serves as a reminder that even the bravest and most skilled warriors are not invincible, and that the cost of heroism can be high.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 81943}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Shekinah Jacob\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Shekinah Jacob (Chennai) is an Indian playwright based in Bangalore.\n\nEarly life\nAs she stated in her interview (http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/her-plays-go-places/article5092888.ece) in The Hindu dated 14 September 2013,  playwriting came naturally to her at a very young age. Her first tryst with writing was in school when she won a national short story writing competition. In her high school in Vellore, Ida Scudder School, she wrote a musical for the annual play production, finding it easier to write one than to find an appropriate play in the library as her principal had initially suggested.\n\nShe graduated from Women's Christian College, Chennai. It was here that she began to explore this gift further\u2026being an all women's college, they had no male actors and so she wrote a play titled Seven for a Secret that had an all-women cast. It went on to win the Best Script prize and the Best Audience Response at an inter-collegiate theatre festival.\n\nShe worked as a reporter in Bangalore doing food and play reviews. She then did an MA in English Literature at the University of Madras. She worked as a copywriter and then as a technical writer.\n\nLife as a playwright\n\nWhen she scribbled her first script on the back of a notebook in school, it was simply her idea of what she thought a play should look like. Yet, she says, the form came naturally. \nShe wrote her second full length script while studying at Women's Christian College. But she learnt the fundamentals of playwriting during a workshop by Mahesh Dattani and was later trained by the Royal Court Theatre in London.She says about her experience in her interview with 'The Hindu' \"I learnt how drama is action. Cause and effect. Your left brain and right brain have to work together.\u201d\n \nIn WCC she had to write a play with no male actors in it. So she wrote a play with 7 girls in it titled \"Seven for a Secret \"and it was this play that got her into a workshop with the Royal Court Theatre, London. The play was performed in Chennai and it won the Best Script prize and Best Audience Response prize.\nShe participated in a playwriting workshop by Mahesh Dattani and the play she wrote at the end of this titled 'Only Women' had a rehearsed reading at the British Council.\n\nShe also wrote a monologue titled 'We are Water' that was aired on BBC radio in Sept 2003.\n\nAfter taking up various other jobs, she realised that her passion was in theatre, especially writing scripts.\nSo she approached the Royal Court Theatre again. This time she sent them a play that she had been working on. It was the original draft of 'The Long Way Home'. 'The Long Way Home', found its way to the country's most prestigious stages, from NCPA and Prithvi in Mumbai to the Museum Theatre in Chennai, last year. She had become a mother by then, and so she explored the dynamics between a mother and daughter.\" The play evolved as she realised her strength was dialogue.\n\nThe play 'The Long Way Home' was produced and staged by Evam entertainment and directed by Karthik Kumar. It starred the talented dancer-actor Anita Ratnam. The role was so authentic that every performance ended with people walking up to her and saying, \"You're just like my mom\".\nThe play was shown in Mumbai, Chennai and Bangalore. Shekinah says, \"I realized that even if I'm writing about the small world I know, a domineering south Indian mother isn't too different from a mother at the other end of the world. As playwrights we have to fall in love with creating believable characters.\"\n\nHer biggest and most acclaimed work till date has been the hugely successful \"Ali J\".\n\nAli J began with a real story. Her brother is a lawyer who works with a human rights organisation in Mumbai. He told her about a young man who was imprisoned because drugs were planted in his bag. The man spent 10 years in a Mauritius prison, and then was moved to Mumbai. He's still in prison.\nAround the same time, evam asked her to write them a monologue for 'The Fringe'. \"They originally wanted one on Muhammad Ali Jinnah, and realizing how little Indian history she knew, she began to read extensively on the subject.\" After six months of reading, she decided to morph the two subjects. \"The actual writing took just as long as it took her to type.\u201d\n\nAli J, produced by evam entertainment premiered at the recent Edinburgh Fringe Festival and ran for 25 days garnering rave reviews and a four star review from The Scotsman. It will open the NCPA Centrestage Festival in Mumbai next, after which it will tour the country.\n\nThe story works on two levels. It's about a guy in his 30s imprisoned in a cell in Chennai who is on death row for a crime he did not commit. It's about how circumstances and people shape his vision. She adds, \"The point is to capture the idea that a single event can change the course of your life. All of us are acted on by so many influences \u2013 childhood, love, jealousy\u2026. Great historical figures were no different. Their decisions are so influenced by personal egos, ambitions, and little distractions.\n\nAli J by evam premiered at the recent Edinburgh Fringe Festival, and ran for 25 days garnering rave reviews. It will open the NCPA Centrestage Festival in Mumbai next, after which it will tour the country.\n\nTalking about her inspiration in her interview with \"The Indian Express\" on 25 October 2013 Jacob says, \"I read as widely as possible\u2013 my favorite playwrights include Alan Bennet for the brilliant way in which he captures miniature shifts of mood and the textured dynamics of relationships, also Tom Stoppard and David Mamet. And of course the immortal Shakespeare,\" she says. According to Jacob, good theatre is like a good democracy, 'by the people, of the people, and for the people'. She writes what she would like to watch as an audience. She enjoys watching plays that are rooted in her world. Theatre should be like an ongoing dialogue between the audience and the actors.\n\nShekinah Jacob began her own theatre group called Open House Productions, mainly to combine her two loves- entertaining, thought-provoking theatre that also generates income for charitable causes. The uniqueness of this theatre company is that operates on a Robin Hood model, funded by corporates and well-wishers, while most of the revenue from ticket sales go to deserving local NGOs in every locality that they perform in.\n\nOpen House Productions feel that artists should be rewarded for their time and talent and they try to pay every performer as generously as possible. \nIn an interview in 2015, playwright Naren Weiss told India-West that his play Censored came to him after Jacob's Ali J had been banned in multiple cities across India. The play was later shot as a sketch by the Stray Factory and went viral in India.\n\nTwo years ago Shekinah Jacob won the Charles Wallace Scholarship and acquired a Masters in Writing for Performance with a Distinction at Goldsmiths, University of London. Her course and exposure to cutting-edge theatre on London's stages was a huge learning experience and she has brought all of that back to the second innings of Open House Theatre Productions that was on a brief break during her years in the U.K. They are now back with The Christmas Shootout, a comedy for the festive season, beginning a national tour in December 2016 in all the four metros. They are also going international this year with an eighth show in Dubai, to reach a total audience of over 5500 people.\n\nPlay Ali J\nPart Bollywood romance, part social commentary on the after-effects of the partitioning of India, this perfectly pitched play by Shekinah Jacob, produced by Evam Theatre, never lets the weighty issues it tackles overshadow a heartfelt personal story. The writing is rich with humour and humanity, and TK Karthik's engaging performance brings Ali's warm and welcoming character to life.\n\nThe Scotsman  \u2013 \"Hot show pick...\" 4 stars\n\nThe play is both heartfelt and cerebral as it paints a picture of an India still living in the wake of brutal partition following independence, simultaneously telling the story of one man and millions of people. The writing is never simplistic but always open, and uttered with a joy of life that can only come to those facing death. Sublime.\n\nThree Weeks -\"Heartfelt and Cerebral\" \u2013 5 stars\n\nNo Borders \u2013 \"Beautifully written script ...

Aquino said that while he is open to adopt nuclear energy he is more inclined to tap \"other sources of energy that have less impact \u2013 or potential negative impact \u2013 that are available to us. While Aquino remained open to nuclear energy he has publicly expressed his opposition to plans to revive the moth-balled Bataan Nuclear Power Plant.\n\nEnvironmental policy\nDuring an interview in CNN in November 2013, Aquino said that countries \"contributing immensely to the global warning\" have a moral responsibility to contribute to end climate change.\n\nFinancial policy\n\nPriority Development Assistance Fund\nFollowing the Priority Development Assistance Fund scam, Aquino initially insisted that the abolition of the Priority Development Assistance Fund or PDAF is unnecessary. Aquino later detracted from his earlier statement and vowed to abolish the fund and replace it with a new system.\n\nSocial policy\n\nAbortion and reproductive health\nDespite his support for the Reproductive Health Bill, which was perceived by critics as a precedent to a law on legalizing abortion, Aquino insists that he is against the legalization of abortion.\n\nAquino supported the passing of the Reproductive Health Bill. He believes on the responsibility of the state to inform couples on their right to plan their family.\n\nForeign land ownership\nAquino is against revising the constitution to allow full land ownership by foreigners. Aquino remains firm in keeping the 60/40 foreign ownership law which guarantees Filipinos majority share on land ownership.\n\nGay marriage\nAquino has yet to make a firm stance on gay marriage. During a forum at the Sofitel Philippine Plaza in December 2013, Aquino was inquired on his view on gay marriage and if he was in favor of its legalization. Aquino initially refused to answer the question but later clarified his views on the issue. He said that while he believes on universal human rights he is undecided on the legalization of gay marriage. Aquino expressed some concerns that legalization of gay marriage may follow legalization of abortion. He said that the issue must first be viewed on a \"child's perspective\".He expressed concerns that children adopted by gay marriage couples may experience gender confusion.\n\nSecurity policy\n\nGun ownership\nAquino, a gun enthusiast himself, is against the imposition of a total gun ban in the country. He believes in the right to bear arms. On May 29, 2013, Aquino signed the Republic Act No. 10591, an \"Act Providing for a Comprehensive Law on Firearms and Ammunition and Providing Penalties for Violations thereof\", providing a new set of standards on obtaining a license to bear firearms.\n\nHeight restriction on security personnel\nAquino vetoed a bill that would have remove height restrictions on police, fire and jail personnel. Aquino found the bill unnecessary as a waiver can be given to applicants under certain conditions. Aquino insists that jail personnel in particular \"must possess the necessary physical attributes to perform their functions effectively\".\n\nForeign policy\n\nChina\nAquino has made statements critical to China indirectly and directly. At the 2013 ASEAN summit in Brunei, He accused China of being uncooperative after it rejected to participate in a case filed by the Philippines to the United Nations tribunal. Aqunio also said that he is open of an idea of a joint development in the South China Sea but remained cautious and insisted that a joint development would be under Philippine law.\n\nAquino supports a diplomatic solution to the South China Sea dispute. He reiterated that ASEAN members should draft the Code of Conduct of Parties in the West Philippine Sea before commencing ASEAN-China talks.\n\nJapan\nAquino supported a proposal to allow Japanese troops access to Philippine military bases along with another proposal to give American troops greater access to Philippine military installation. Aquino views these proposals as an avenue to build a credible alliance with Japan and the United States.\n\nReferences\n\nBenigno Aquino III\nPolitical positions of Philippine politicians", "machine_text": "Benigno Simeon Cojuangco Aquino III, commonly known as Noynoy Aquino, was the 15th President of the Philippines from 2010 to 2016. During his presidency, he had several political positions that he advocated for, including good governance, anti-corruption, inclusive economic growth, education, and health reform. One of Aquino's main political positions was his commitment to good governance. He believed that the government should be transparent and accountable to the people, so he created the Philippine Open Government Partnership in 2013. This initiative aimed to promote transparency by encouraging the disclosure of government information and improving public participation in decision-making processes. Aquino also prioritized fighting corruption. He believed that corruption was a significant obstacle to economic growth, so he established the Presidential Anti-Corruption Commission in 2010 to investigate and prosecute corrupt officials. He also signed into law the Freedom of Information Act, which granted citizens access to public records and information. Another political position that Aquino advocated for was inclusive economic growth. He believed that economic growth should benefit all sectors of society, not just the wealthy. He implemented programs such as the Conditional Cash Transfer program, which provided financial assistance to the poorest families in the country, to help reduce poverty and inequality. Aquino also prioritized education reform and health reform. He increased the budget for education and implemented the K-12 program, which added two years to the basic education system. Additionally, he signed into law the National Health Insurance Act, which expanded health care coverage to all Filipino citizens. In conclusion, Benigno Aquino III had several political positions during his presidency, including good governance, anti-corruption, inclusive economic growth, education, and health reform. His commitment to these positions helped improve the lives of many Filipinos and strengthened the country's political and economic systems.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 41279599}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Cercospora kikuchii\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Cercospora kikuchii is a fungal plant pathogen that affects soybeans. It results in both the Cercospora leaf blight and purple seed stain diseases on soybean and is found almost worldwide.  C. kikuchii produces the toxin cercosporin, as do a number of other Cercospora species.\n\nSymptoms\n\nSeed: The disease on the host soybean itself can be determined by a light activated red perlene quinon, cercosporin, with a molecular weight of 534. Purple seed stain by Cercospora can be determined by a variety of factors. First, infected seeds have spots that are usually pink or purple. The size can be from minuscule to covering the whole seed (Li 2019). The coloration will be from the hilum area.  Germination and seedling size may be delayed after 50% of the seed is covered. They may also have lower oil and higher protein.\n\nCotyledons: Cotyledons will shrivel and fall off.\n\nStems: Stems will have red deep lesions about \u00bc inch in size.\n\nLeaves: Young leaves on top and bottom will have reddish purple lesions from minuscule to \u00bd inch in size. The leaf itself will become purple, described as a dark bronzing.  Severely infected upper leaves will fall off (Giesler).\n\nEnvironment\n\nThe disease thrives in conditions of high temperature and humidity. \u201cSporulation increases as temperature rises above 80 degrees Fahrenheit\u201d (Jeschke 2020). More wind and water (rain, river, ground water) will result in further and more spore distribution on plant tissue. It usually occurs later in the season around August. The disease survives on crop residue from four months to four years (Ward, 2015). This means it thrives on no till tilled repeat planted fields (Schapaugh 2014).\n\nManagement\n\nExtended crop rotation and residue incorporation reduces inoculum. \nSeed treatment foliar fungicides applied during R3- R5 can reduce blight incidence and severity. \nThe farmers can blend infected beans with clean and still sell them (Successful Farming Staff 2018). Dr. Anne Dorrance in 2019 also suggested planting varieties with resistance to Cercospora, plant disease free seeds, proper plant spacing to prevent spore spreading, and harvest during dry times.\n\nReferences\n\n2.

This plant disease occurs in regions where soybeans are grown, and it affects both the yield and quality of soybean crops. The fungus was first identified by Japanese plant pathologist Kenichi Kikuchi, who described it in 1910. Symptoms of Cercospora leaf blight appear on the soybean leaves as small, dark brown spots that gradually enlarge to form a target-like pattern. The infected leaves may eventually turn yellow and fall off, leading to reduced photosynthesis and eventual yield loss. Severe infections can also affect the stems and pods of the soybean plant. Cercospora kikuchii can spread rapidly through airborne spores and may survive in crop debris, soil, and infected soybean seeds. Therefore, it is essential to practice crop rotation and avoid planting soybean crops in the same area for several years to prevent the pathogen's build-up in the soil. Fungicides can be applied to control Cercospora leaf blight, but the best approach is to use resistant soybean varieties. Many soybean cultivars have been developed with resistance to Cercospora leaf blight, and farmers should select resistant varieties to reduce economic losses due to the disease. The pathogenicity mechanisms of Cercospora kikuchii are still not thoroughly understood, but research suggests that the fungus produces various enzymes and toxins that contribute to its virulence. Continued research will help us better understand the pathogen's life cycle, its infection mechanisms, and how to manage and control this devastating disease.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 11798042}

Born in the North African city of Thagaste, Augustine studied in Carthage, becoming an accomplished but dissolute orator. After converting to Manichaeism, a guiltfree religion, he was called to the imperial court in Milan to serve as an opponent to the Christian bishop Ambrose. But when the Empress Justina sends imperial guards to clear out a basilica where Augustine's own mother is worshipping, he is won over to Christianity. Back in Hippo, Augustine urges the Roman garrison to negotiate with the Vandal King Genseric, but they proudly refuse.

Authored by Saint Augustine of Hippo, the Confessions is a personal account of the author's life, his spiritual journey, and his search for truth and meaning in a world that he found to be deeply flawed and sinful. The book is divided into thirteen chapters, each of which deals with a different aspect of Augustine's life. The first chapter deals with his early childhood, while subsequent chapters cover his studies, his conversion to Christianity, his theological beliefs, and his experiences as a bishop. Throughout the book, Augustine explores the themes of sin and redemption, despair and hope, and the struggle to find God in a fallen world. One of the most striking aspects of the Confessions is its frank and honest portrayal of Augustine's inner turmoil. He is not afraid to admit his weaknesses and failings, and he acknowledges the pain and anguish that he has caused himself and others. At the same time, however, he remains steadfast in his belief that God is present in every aspect of his life and that he is ultimately responsible for his own salvation. Despite its age, the Confessions remains a beloved and influential work of Christian literature. It has inspired countless readers over the centuries and continues to be widely read and studied today. Its themes of sin, redemption, and the search for meaning and purpose in life are as relevant today as they were in Augustine's time, and its message of hope and faith continues to offer comfort and guidance to people all over the world.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 28833735}

Oh Land wrote the song with the sole producer, Thomas Bartlett. It was digitally distributed as the third single from the album on 22 March 2019, through Tusk or Tooth Records. The song's release came with the announcement of new dates for her ongoing promotional Family Tree tour. It is an electronic song with a melancholic, piano and string-led production. Venezuelan-American singer-songwriter Devendra Banhart provides background vocals on the song.\n\nThe lyrics of \"Kiss in Songs\" detail Oh Land's desire to find someone who she can communicate with on a musical basis. It also serves as a reminder to Oh Land about what is important to her. The song received generally favourable reviews from music critics, with some reviewers calling it beautiful and happy. Oh Land has since performed the song at the Koncerthuset in Copenhagen in September 2019.\n\nBackground and release \nAfter the release of Earth Sick (2014), her fourth studio album, Oh Land divided her time up for a number of side projects, including the recording of soundtracks Askepot (2016) and Watermusic (2018), and a cover of Denmark's national anthem for the 2018 television series The Rain. In 2018, she revealed to Rolling Stone that her then-upcoming album would be released in 2019 and was inspired by several recent events of her personal life, such as the divorce from her husband, her second pregnancy, and relocating back to Denmark. As she began songwriting sessions, Oh Land started to focus on relearning how to play the piano, which resulted in a sound and tonal shift for the album.\n\n\"Kiss in Songs\" was first announced to the public in a press release that stated it would be the third single from Family Tree. The song was released for digital download and streaming in Denmark and the United States on 22 March 2019, through Tusk or Tooth Records. The song's cover art uses an original, hand-embroidered design that was created by Danish artist Sarah Becker. \"Kiss in Songs\" served as the third single from Family Tree, following the releases of \"Human Error\" and \"Brief Moment\". The song's release came alongside the addition of more European tour dates for Oh Land's promotional Family Tree tour, which was first announced on 22 February 2019. On 3 May 2019, \"Kiss in Songs\" was included as the fourth track on Oh Land's fifth studio album Family Tree.\n\nIn the song's press release, Oh Land explained that it serves as a reminder for her as to why she makes music: \"I guess the whole reason I do music is that I express myself more clearly through melodies and singing.\" It was written by Oh Land and Thomas Bartlett, the latter of which solely produced the track. Oh Land received additional credits for creating the melody and lyrics for \"Kiss in Songs\". The song was mastered by UE Nastasi at Sterling Sound Studios in Edgewater, New Jersey. It was mixed by Patrick Dillett, while Peter Pejtsik served as the track's conductor.\n\nComposition and lyrics \n\nMusically, \"Kiss in Songs\" is a melancholic electronic song that is backed by piano and strings. Ole Rosenstand Svidt from Gaffa placed the song among the most ecclesiastical in Oh Land's discography. Of similar nature, Simon B\u00e6kgaard from SoundVenue described the song's melody as something one would associate with Sunday High mass. He also stated that the instrumental introduction reminded him of a hymn. \"Kiss in Songs\" is accompanied by a piano, played by Bartlett, who was also in charge of additional musical arrangements.\n\nAccording to its sheet music, \"Kiss in Songs\" is set in the time signature of common time, and has a moderately slow tempo of 80 beats per minute. The song is composed in the key of C major and it follows the setup of a verse, followed by chorus-verse-chorus and a post-chorus. Venezuelan-American singer-songwriter Devendra Banhart provides background vocals on the track.\n\nLyrically, \"Kiss in Songs\" features Oh Land describing how her potential love interest is able to communicate with her through music as opposed to just speaking. With the song, she attempts to \"forget [about] the ways we are used to using language\" and instead \"communicate on a more primal level\". Oh Land explained the overall meaning of \"Kiss in Songs\": \"In this song, I find someone who understands my language.\" In the song's chorus, Oh Land admits to her lover: \"And while history is written / And politics is spitten / We kiss in songs / And I'm missing you.\"\n\nReception and promotion \n\"Kiss in Songs\" was met with generally favourable reviews from music critics. Svidt featured the song in his column of the week's 12 best new songs, for Gaffa, during the third week of March 2019. In his review, he called Oh Land's voice pleasant-sounding due to her shift towards a more organic creative direction. He also considered the song among Oh Land's other music that sounds magical. B\u00e6kgaard labelled the song beautiful and explained that it may contain some of the best chords he had heard in awhile. Emma Sejersen, a writer for Politiken, enjoyed the song, calling it one of the happiest-sounding tracks on Family Tree. Erin Vierra, from Mxdwn.com, also called \"Kiss in Songs\" a beautiful song, and said it \"lifts the listener up and refuses to let go\".\n\nIn September 2019, Oh Land performed a live show at Koncerthuset in Copenhagen. During the concert, she opened the night with a performance of \"Kiss in Songs\", followed by fellowalbum tracks \"Sunlight\" and \"Make My Trouble Beautiful\". Ivan Rod, a contributor to Gaffa, reviewed her performance and found that the aforementioned songs could have benefitted from being performed in a more intimate setting, due to their quiet nature. He wrote that although the songs were unable to meet the fullness of the performance space, they ended up being some of the highlights of Oh Land's show.\n\nTrack listing\n\nCredits and personnel \nCredits adapted from the liner notes of Family Tree.\n Nanna \u00d8land Fabriciuslyrics, melody, music\n Thomas Bartlettproduction, additional arrangements, piano\n Patrick Dillettmixing\n UE Nastasimastering\n Peter Pejtsikconductor\n Devendra Banhartbackground vocals\n\nRelease history\n\nReferences \n\nSongs about language\n2019 singles\n2019 songs\nElectronic songs\nOh Land songs\nSong recordings produced by Doveman\nSongs about music\nSongs written by Doveman\nSongs written by Oh Land", "machine_text": "Kiss in Songs \"Kiss\" is one of the most popular words used in the lyrics of songs, particularly in the romantic and pop music genres. This word is used to describe the expression of unbounded love, passion and affection between two persons, generally as an act of intimacy. Many great musicians, from various genres, have written songs that feature the word \"kiss\" or explicitly describe a kiss in romantic form. Notably, the rock music band Kiss, who formed in New York City in 1973, have used the word \"kiss\" in all of their album titles, including \"Kiss\" (1974), \"Kiss Meets the Phantom of the Park\" (1978), and \"Kiss Symphony: Alive IV\" (2003). The band's logo, which depicts a stylized human silhouette with a long tongue, has become widely recognized as an iconic and potent symbol of rock music. One of the most famous songs about a kiss is \"Kiss\" by Prince, which was released in 1986 and went to number one on the US charts. The song's lyrics describe an intense, passionate desire for a kiss, and the pop icon's signature falsetto voice is perfectly suited for the romantic message conveyed. Another notable song is the classic jazz standard \"A Kiss to Build a Dream On\" by Louis Armstrong, which was first released in 1951. The song's lyrics suggest that a kiss from a loved one can provide the foundation for an idealized future together. In addition to Kiss, Prince, Armstrong, and other musicians, multiple other pop singers have written songs featuring the word \"kiss.\" These include Britney Spears in her song \"Kiss You All Over\", and Madonna in her song \"Cherish.\" In conclusion, \"kiss\" is a universally appealing word that resonates with people of all ages and cultures, and it's no surprise that so many musicians have used it in their song lyrics. A kiss is a universal act of love and affection, and it has inspired countless songs in many different genres. Whatever the genre of music one may prefer, the universal feeling evoked by this small, intimate act has allowed artists to create long-lasting pieces of lyrical art that will forever be enjoyed and remembered by generations to come.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 60045353}

The expedition was led by Sir John Franklin, a British officer and explorer who was tasked with finding a Northwest Passage through the Canadian Arctic. The expedition's ultimate goal was to open new trading routes for the British Empire, but it ended in disaster. The expedition consisted of two ships, HMS Erebus and HMS Terror, and approximately 129 officers and crew members. However, the expedition was poorly organized and ill-equipped for Arctic conditions. The ships became trapped in ice and the men were forced to abandon them and trek across the frozen landscape. Over time, starvation, exposure, and scurvy claimed the lives of all the crew. In 1859, over a decade after the expedition set out, a search team found evidence of the fate of Franklin and his men. The team discovered a note that had been left in a cairn on King William Island. The note described how the ships had become trapped in ice and how the crew had then attempted to walk to safety. It also included a famous passage about the fate of the expedition: \"We have not been able to procure any food; everyone has died. And we had to resort to cannibalism in order to survive.\" The explorers' remains were never properly laid to rest, but in the early 21st century, a Canadian team undertook to find both ships. In 2014 the Erebus was found, and then three years later the Terror was discovered. The find provides new insights into the conditions encountered by the expedition members as well as the struggle against harsh natural conditions. Currently, Parks Canada officials are working to protect the wrecks of both vessels to ensure that they can be studied and preserved for future generations to learn from. The doomed expedition continues to fascinate and captivate people around the world, and remains one of the most tragic and mysterious events in the history of Arctic exploration.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 45555991}

These clubs typically host events, meetings, and trips related to railways and trains, as well as provide education and information on the industry. History The history of railway clubs can be traced back to the early 1900s, when the first enthusiasts in Britain began forming groups to share their passion for railways. These groups would often organize trips to visit railway stations, attend exhibitions and events, and to discuss the latest trends and technologies in the railway industry. Over time, these clubs became more formalized and organized, with the establishment of a dedicated organization, The Railway Club of Great Britain, in 1910. The club played an instrumental role in the development of the railway industry and remains an influential organization today. Activities Railway clubs may organize various activities and events for their members. These can range from visits to railway museums, locomotive yards, and heritage trains, to talks and presentations on the history and development of railways. Some clubs may organize rail tours, providing members with the opportunity to travel on historic railways or other significant railway routes. In addition, railway clubs may publish newsletters or magazines, providing members with information on industry news, new projects, and other topics of interest. In summary, railway clubs offer a platform for individuals with a shared interest in the railway industry to connect and engage with others. By facilitating the exchange of knowledge and ideas, and organizing activities related to the industry, these clubs play a vital role in promoting and preserving railway heritage and culture.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 31021221}

The incumbent Governor, Jodi Rell, a Republican, won re-election to a full term as Governor of Connecticut, defeating John DeStefano, the Democratic nominee. Background: Jodi Rell became Governor in July 2004, following the resignation of Governor John G. Rowland, who was convicted of corruption charges. In November 2006, she faced John DeStefano, the Mayor of New Haven, as the Democratic nominee for the Governor of Connecticut. DeStefano had previously won the Democratic nomination in a crowded primary, defeating the former US Senator Joe Lieberman's 2006 running-mate and Stamford businessman Ned Lamont. Campaign: The 2006 Connecticut gubernatorial election was one of the most expensive in the state's history, with both candidates raising significant amounts of money from various sources. Rell was immensely popular among voters in Connecticut, which was reflected in the polls indicating that she had a significant lead over DeStefano throughout the campaign. Rell highlighted her successes during her tenure, including the successful implementation of tax cuts and her commitment to education and healthcare reform. DeStefano, on the other hand, campaigned on issues relating to economic growth, stem cell research, and affordable healthcare for all, promising to create jobs and reduce the cost of healthcare. He also criticized Rell for not doing enough to address issues such as transportation and education. DeStefano's campaign received support from local unions, environmental groups, and social activists. Results: In the November election, Rell won by a large margin, receiving 63.2% of the votes. DeStefano received 35.1% of the votes. Aftermath: Rell's victory in the 2006 Connecticut gubernatorial election solidified her position as a popular and influential leader in Connecticut. She went on to serve as Governor until 2011 when she decided not to seek re-election. The election also marked a turning point for the Connecticut Democratic Party, which continued to face losses in the state's gubernatorial races, until the party succeeded in electing Ned Lamont as governor in 2018.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2130185}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Hot game\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "\n\nIn combinatorial game theory, a branch of mathematics, a hot game is one in which each player can improve their position by making the next move. \n\nBy contrast, a cold game is one where each player can only worsen their position by making the next move.  Cold games have values in the surreal numbers and so can be ordered by value, while hot games can have other values.\n\nExample\nFor example, consider a game in which players alternately remove tokens of their own color from a table, the Blue player removing only blue tokens and the Red player removing only red tokens, with the winner being the last player to remove a token.  Obviously, victory will go to the player who starts off with more tokens, or to the second player if the number of red and blue tokens are equal.  Removing a token of one's own color leaves the position slightly worse for the player who made the move, since that player now has fewer tokens on the table.  Thus each token represents a \"cold\" component of the game.\n\nNow consider a special purple token bearing the number \"100\", which may be removed by either player, who then replaces the purple token with 100 tokens of their own color.  (In the notation of Conway, the purple token is the game {100|\u2212100}.)  The purple token is a \"hot\" component, because it is highly advantageous to be the player who removes the purple token.  Indeed, if there are any purple tokens on the table, players will prefer to remove them first, leaving the red or blue tokens for last.  In general, a player will always prefer to move in a hot game rather than a cold game, because moving in a hot game improves their position, while moving in a cold game injures their position.\n\nTemperature\nThe temperature of a game is a measure of its value to the two players.  A purple \"100\" token has a temperature of 100 because its value to each player is 100 moves.  In general, players will prefer to move in the hottest component available.  For example, suppose there is a purple \"100\" token and also a purple \"1,000\" token which allows the player who takes it to dump 1,000 tokens of their own color on the table.  Each player will prefer to remove the \"1,000\" token, with temperature 1,000 before the \"100\" token, with temperature 100.\n\nTo take a slightly more complicated example, consider the game {10|2}\u00a0+\u00a0{5|\u22125}.  {5|\u22125} is a token which either player may replace with 5 tokens of their own color, and {10|2} is a token which the Blue player may replace with 10 blue tokens or the Red player may replace with 2 blue tokens.\n\nThe temperature of the {10|2} component is \u00bd(10\u00a0\u2212\u00a02) =\u00a04, while the temperature of the {5|\u22125} component is 5.  This suggests that each player should prefer to play in the {5|\u22125} component.  Indeed, the best first move for the Red player is to replace {5|\u22125} with \u22125, whereupon the Blue player replaces {10|2} with 10, leaving a total of 5; had the Red player moved in the cooler {10|2} component instead, the final position would have been 2\u00a0+\u00a05\u00a0=\u00a07, which is worse for Red.  Similarly, the best first move for the Blue player is also in the hotter component, from {5|-5} to 5, even though moving in the {10|2} component produces more blue tokens in the short term.\n\nSnort \n\nIn the game of Snort, Red and Blue players take turns coloring the vertices of a graph, with the constraint that two vertices that are connected by an edge may not be colored differently.   As usual, the last player to make a legal move is the winner.  Since a player's moves improve their position by effectively reserving the adjacent vertices for them alone, positions in Snort are typically hot.  In contrast, in the closely related game Col, where adjacent vertices may not have the same color, positions are usually cold.\n\nApplications\n\nThe theory of hot games has found some application in the analysis of endgame strategy in Go.\n\nSee also\n\n Domineering, another game in which hot positions arise\n Cooling and heating (combinatorial game theory), operations to make hot games amenable to the same type of analysis as cold games\n\nReferences \n\n \n \n\nCombinatorial game theory", "machine_text": "Hot Game Hot game refers to a type of competitive activity that is both physically and mentally intense, typically played between teams or individuals. This term can also refer to any game that is currently popular or in demand, with a strong following and fanbase. Physical intensity is commonly seen in sports such as basketball, soccer, or football. Mental intensity, on the other hand, is often seen in games that require strategy and critical thinking, such as chess or poker. Hot games combine both of these elements, creating a challenging and exciting experience for players and spectators alike. One popular hot game is the game of \u201chot potato,\u201d in which a small object is passed quickly from player to player, with the goal of avoiding being caught holding the object when time runs out. Other examples of hot games include capture-the-flag, dodgeball, and trivia games. In recent years, video games have become a dominant force in the world of hot games, with multiplayer games such as Fortnite, Call of Duty, and League of Legends attracting millions of players and spectators around the world. These games require both physical dexterity and mental strategy, as players must work together to defeat their opponents and achieve their objectives. Hot games can be played in a variety of settings, from backyards and playgrounds to stadiums and arenas. They can also be played competitively, with tournaments and leagues organized around popular games and sports. In conclusion, hot games offer players and spectators alike a thrilling and challenging experience that combines physical and mental intensity.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"The Epic of American Civilization\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Epic of American Civilization is a mural by the social realist painter Jos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco.  It is located in the basement reading room of the Baker Memorial Library on the campus of Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. The mural, painted between 1932 and 1934, consists of a series of 24 fresco panels, whose principal themes are the impact of both indigenous Native Americans and European colonists on North America, and the impact of war (particularly the Mexican Civil War and the First World War) and rapid industrialization on the human spirit.\n\nOrozco painted the mural during the same time his fellow muralist, Diego Rivera, was working on his murals at the Rockefeller Center in New York. But while Rivera's portrait of Lenin led to his mural being painted over, Orozco was given full political freedom to paint as he chose. His images offended a group of Dartmouth parents who called themselves the Boston Mothers. \"We would be everlastingly grateful to you,\" the mothers wrote to college president Ernest Hopkins, \"if the pictures could be destroyed.\" Another letter to Hopkins was more blunt: \"Orozco has shouted forth in paint the Communist Manifesto!\"\n\nBut Hopkins, a lifelong Republican, defended Orozco's right to paint as he chose. \"There are 100% Americans who have objected to the fact that we employed a Mexican to do this work,\" Hopkins wrote to the mothers, \"but I have never believed that art could be made either racial or national.\" Responding to concerns that Orozco's imagery was not \"nice\", Hopkins wrote, \"if that be a criterion of judgment many of the great works of the medieval masters would have to be removed from the Louvre.\"\n\nThe mural was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2013.\n\nBackground\nThe mural was Orozco's third and last work in the United States, following Prometheus at Pomona College in Southern California and a mural cycle at The New School in Manhattan.\n\nThe Coming and Departure of Quetzalcoatl\nThe two themes of the mural are arranged in separate wings of the reading room.  The west wing contains ten panels on the first theme, that of Native Americans.\nMigration\nThis panel is located on the short western wall, to the left of the doors. It depicts the arrival of natives as a grim march, echoing the industrially-oriented panel at the far eastern end of the room.\nSnake and Spears\nLocated over the western doors, this panel shows a rattlesnake flanked by spears. Its color palette suggests it was painted when Orozco worked on the eastern panels.\nAncient Human Sacrifice\nThis panel, to the right of the western doors, depicts human sacrifice as practiced by ancient Mesoamericans, in which the living heart is removed from the sacrificial victim. The panel has an analog (as the first one does) on the opposite wall of the east wing.\nAztec Warriors\nThis and the next four panels are on the north wall of the west wing. This one depicts Aztec warriors wearing eagle and jaguar costumes, and includes a representation of the head of the plumed serpent god Quetzalcoatl.\nComing of Quetzalcoatl\nQuetzalcoatl is presented as a benevolent god in human form. He is shown granting the benefits of education and culture on his people, and driving off older gods.\nThe Pre-Columbian Golden Age\nThe benefits of agriculture, arts, and science brought by Quetzalcoatl bring a golden age. A man works crops, another creates a stone stele, and a third studies the stars.\nDeparture of Quetzalcoatl\nAdherents of the banished gods band together to drive Quetzalcoatl away. Sorcerers massed in front of a pyramidal temple oppose the departing god.\nThe Prophecy\nThis small panel, located above a door, depicts Spanish conquistadors on horseback wielding a giant Christian cross as a weapon.\nTotem Poles\nThis pair of vertical panels are applied to poles in the western half of the room. They are caricatures of totem poles found in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nCortez and the Modern Era\nMachine Totems\nThese vertical panels depict modern industrial themes in a manner similar to a totem pole. They are applied to poles in the eastern half of the room.\nCortez and the Cross\nThis panel and the next four are located on the south wall of the eastern half of the room. Orozco depicts Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s as a brutal anti-hero leading the 16th century Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, fulfilling the prophecy of Quetzalcoatl. Cort\u00e9s stands surrounded by images of destruction, accompanied by a cross-bearing Franciscan friar.\nThe Machine\nThis panel marks the transition to the 20th century, depicting a mass of machinery with no discernible function.\nAnglo-America\nOrozco presents a visually mixed assessment of North American society. A schoolhouse and town meeting are shown, but an overbearing schoolteacher dominates the scene, and the town meeting is presented with rigidity.\nHispano-America\nA modern Mexican rebel, resembling Emilio Zapata, dominates a caricature of rich and militaristic society.\nGods of the Modern World\nThis panel savages the institutional church's indifference to the social upheavals of the 1930s, with flames reminiscent of the scenes from this section's first panel.\nSymbols of Nationalism\nThis small panel is located above a door on the north wall of the east side. It depicts a junk pile of historical symbols of warfare and empire.\nModern Human Sacrifice.\nAn analog to the \"Ancient Human Sacrifice\" panel on the west side, this panel shows the body of a soldier, wrapped in the trappings of patriotism, symbolizing the pointless sacrifice of the individual for the institution. This panel is to the left of the easternmost doors.\nModern Migration of the Spirit\nA depiction of Jesus, sweeps away old religious and political ideologies, discarding symbols of religion, culture, and the military.

It was created by the Mexican artist Jos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco between 1932 and 1934. The mural was commissioned by the college to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the college's founding. The mural measures 3,200 square feet and is made up of 24 panels. It depicts the history of American civilization from pre-Columbian times to the early 20th century. The mural uses a variety of symbolic and metaphorical elements to explore themes such as the struggle between different groups of people and the consequences of technological progress. The first panel of the mural depicts the Aztec calendar and is meant to represent the pre-Columbian era. Subsequent panels show events such as the arrival of Columbus in the New World, the formation of the United States, and the rise of modern industry. The final panels show scenes from the early 20th century, including labor strikes and the growth of urbanization. The Epic of American Civilization is considered to be one of the most important examples of mural art in the United States. It is also significant for the way that it incorporates Orozco's Mexican heritage into its portrayal of American history. The mural is open to the public and is a popular attraction for visitors to Dartmouth College. Despite its importance, the mural has faced controversy over the years due to its depiction of sensitive subjects such as slavery and colonialism. However, it remains a significant work of art that continues to provoke thought and discussion about the history and direction of American civilization.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 42301760}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Cinema of Tunisia\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The cinema of Tunisia began in 1896, when the Lumi\u00e8re brothers began showing animated films in the streets of Tunis.\n\nHistory\nIn 1919, the first feature-length movie produced in North Africa: Les Cinq gentlemen maudits (The Five Accursed Gentlemen) was filmed in Tunisia. In 1924, Samama-Chikli directed a medium-length film called Ain Al-Ghazal (The Girl from Carthage) thus making him, one of the first native filmmakers in North African. In 1966, the first feature Tunisian film (95 minutes) Al-Fajr (The Dawn) was directed and produced by Omar Khlifi; it was shot on a 35 mm film. Tunisia also hosts the Carthage Film Festival which has been taking place since 1966. The festival gives priority to films from Arab-speaking and African countries. It is the oldest film festival on the African continent.\n\nIn 1927, the first Tunisian film distribution company, Tunis-Film, started its activities. After independence, movies were exclusively produced by Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme Tunisienne de Production et d'Expansion Cin\u00e9matographique (SATPEC) which controlled cinema and filming productions in the country at the time. Nevertheless, during the 1980s, private production companies and studios emerged and wanted to make Tunisia the Mediterranean Hollywood. The producer Tarak Ben Ammar, a nephew of Wasila Bourguiba, succeeded in attracting some big production companies to shoot inside his studios in Monastir. Major foreign movies were filmed in Tunisia including Roman Polanski's Pirates and Franco Zeffirelli's Jesus of Nazareth. After visiting Tunisia George Lucas was seduced by the natural beauty and authentic old architecture of some Southern Tunisian towns where he decided to film important scenes of Star Wars, as well as Indiana Jones. Moreover, Anthony Minghella filmed the nine Academy Awards winner The English Patient in a south-west oasis of the country.\n\nDomestic productions were rare: the few movies which were produced since 1967 tried to reflect the new social dynamics, development, identity research, and modernity shock. Some of them achieved relative success outside Tunisia, such as La Goulette (Halq El-Wadi 1996) directed by Ferid Boughedir which showed a flashback of typical community life in the small suburb of La Goulette in a period where Muslims, Jews and Christians lived together in tolerance and peace. Halfaouine: Child of the Terraces (Asfour Stah 1990), also by Boughedir, is possibly the biggest success in the history of Tunisian cinema. The movie showed the life of a child from the Halfaouine suburb of Tunis in the 60s, on a quest to understand relationships, the world of women, and how to be a man. In another earlier movie entitled Man of Ashes (Rih Essedd 1986) Boughedir again depicted Tunisian society without fear or favour, covering prostitution, paedophilia, and inter-faith relations between Tunisian Muslims and Tunisian Jews. In the 1991 film Bezness, he talked about the emerging sexual tourism inside the country. The Ambassadors (As-Soufraa 1975) directed by Naceur Ktari portrayed the life of immigrant Maghrebins in France and their struggle against racism. The film won the Golden Tanit for the best picture during the Carthage Film Festival in 1976, the special jury award from the Locarno International Film Festival in the same year and it has been classified in the Un Certain Regard category during the 1978 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThe first Tunisian actress was Hayd\u00e9e Chikly, who starred in the short film, Zohra in 1922. The first feature film to be directed by a woman was Fatma 75 (1975) by Selma Baccar. Subsequent female directors films such as N\u00e9jia Ben Mabrouk's Sama (1988) and Moufida Tlatli's The Silences of Palace (1994).\n\nIn 2007, several films were produced and grabbed public attention, such as Making Of, directed by Nouri Bouzid and Nejib Belkadi's VHS Kahloucha.\n\nIn 2013, Abdellatif Kechiche was the first-ever Tunisian director to win the Palme D'Or award. For his film Blue Is the Warmest Colour he split the award with his two lead actresses.\n\nOn March 21, 2018, the country opened its first City of Culture, a project one of its kind in Africa and the Arab world , located in downtown Tunis. The complex contains several theaters, cinemas, screens, art and history galleries, exhibition halls, a contemporary and modern art museum, a national book centre and a cultural investment centre. \n\nThe first ever Cineplex in Tunisia opened in Tunis City mall in Tunis in December 2018, it consists of 8 screens and is operated by Les Cin\u00e9mas Gaumont Path\u00e9. Two other multiplexes are set to open by Les Cin\u00e9mas Gaumont Path\u00e9 in the coming years, one containing 8 screens at new Azur city mall in Banlieu Sud of Tunis and one of 6 screens in Sousse. Hotel chain La cigale announced in 2017, that it is building a hotel along with a mall and a multiplex of 10 screens in Gammarth, Banlieue Nord of Tunis and is set to open in 2020.\n\nAs of November 2019, there are 41 screens all across Tunisia.\n\nAcademy Award nominations\n\nTunisia has submitted films for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film on an irregular basis since 1995. The award is handed out annually by the United States Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-English dialogue. As of 2021, seven Tunisian films have been submitted for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film.

Although Tunisia's film industry has been much less well-known and smaller than its powerful counterparts, the country has had a thriving film industry that has produced around 110 feature films and a variety of award-winning documentaries and short films. Tunisia's cinema was inspired in the 1920s by French colonial authorities who introduced the art and science of film-making. During the colonial period, Tunisians were identified only as characters of the French nation and had a quite limited presence in the films. When Tunisia obtained independence, cultural practices changed dramatically. The explosion of the independent cinema movement in the 1960s and 1970s coincided with another key historical event in Tunisia, the end of colonial domination and the establishment of the Tunisian Republic. In this context, the establishment of institutions, particularly the National Center for Cinema and Image (CNCI), provided new support systems which helped the industry to consolidate and produce more high-quality films. The Tunisian cinema experienced its true golden age in the 1980s and early 1990s, when movies from the region were showcased at notable international film festivals and impressed audiences in the West and the Arab world alike. Among the country's most iconic films are \"Halfaouine,\" \"Chronicle of the Years of Fire,\" and \"Golden Horseshoes.\" Tunisian cinema is renowned for its close study of the social and political structures of Tunisian society and the postcolonial world in general. Themes range from the political background and national struggle for independence to the progressive forces of society. In conclusion, Tunisian cinema is an example of the remarkable accomplishments its people have achieved in the world of artistic expression, both in the past and today. Its heritage remains an invaluable resource in the eyes of many and a powerful means of documenting and disseminating the country's culture and history.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 24243823}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Sir Hugo\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Sir Hugo (1889\u20131910) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. In a career that lasted from 1891 to 1894 he ran eight times and won three races. As a three-year-old in 1892 he won The Derby at odds of 40/1. He was a consistent performer in top class races, but certainly inferior to his contemporaries Orme and La Fleche.\n\nBackground\nSir Hugo was a big, \"very-finely made\" chestnut horse with a white blaze, bred by his owner Orlando Bridgeman, 3rd Earl of Bradford. The colt was sent to the Earl\u2019s private establishment at  Weston Park in Shropshire where he was trained by Tom Wadlow.\n \nSir Hugo\u2019s sire Wisdom, who died in 1893, was a failure as a racehorse but became a highly successful stallion, siring good horses such as Love Wisely (Ascot Gold Cup), La Sagesse and Surefoot (2000 Guineas, Eclipse Stakes). His dam Manoeuvre was a good stayer who was placed in the St Leger. Apart from Sir Hugo, the best of her progeny was the mare Flying Column, a leading steeplechaser.\n\nRacing career\n\n1891: two-year-old season\nSir Hugo was a successful two-year-old, winning two of his five starts. He made his first appearance at Ascot where he finished third to Polyglot and St Damien in a Triennial Stakes. On 30 July Sir Hugo ran in a Rous Memorial Stakes at Goodwood in which he started the 2/1 favourite in a field of five and won \u201ccleverly\u201d by two lengths from Kyle\n\nIn September Sir Hugo was sent to Doncaster for the Champagne Stakes. He started at 9/1 and finished third of the five runners behind the outstanding filly La Fleche. In October he won the Boscawen Stakes at Newmarket, beating \"nothing of note\". Two weeks later Sir Hugo contested the year\u2019s most important two-year-old race, the Middle Park Plate over six furlongs at the same course. He was not strongly fancied and finished fifth of the ten runners behind the odds-on favourite Orme.\n\nSir Hugo was not considered a serious contender for the following season's Classics\n\n1892: three-year-old season\nSir Hugo began his three-year-old season on 4 May by running in the 2000 Guineas, a race which was considered very open after the withdrawal of the favourite Orme. He raced prominently, showing in third place at one stage, before finishing sixth of the fourteen runners behind Bona Vista\n\nIn the Derby on 1 June at Epsom Sir Hugo started at odds of 40/1 in a field of thirteen with La Fleche, who had won the 1000 Guineas being made the 11/10 favourite. He was ridden by the lightweight jockey Fred Allsopp, who had to carry more than 28 pounds of \"dead weight\" to make the stipulated 126 pounds. The weather was \"gloriously fine\" and the crowd was larger than usual. After several false starts which delayed the race by half an hour, the early running was made by Thessalian and Persistive with Sir Hugo just behind the leaders. The French-trained colt Bucentaur took the lead turning into the straight. Sir Hugo moved past Bucentaur a furlong from the finish and was strongly challenged by La Fleche. Cheered on by the bookmakers, Sir Hugo prevailed by three quarters of a length from the filly after a \"desperate struggle\", with Bucentaur a length further back in third Lord Bradford received \u00a37,000 in prize money, but far more in winning bets, having backed Sir Hugo for the race at 100/1 before he ever ran. There were many observers who considered Sir Hugo's win to have been a \"fluke\". George Barrett, the rider of La Fleche, was criticised for giving the filly too much ground to make up while others drew attention to a collision between St. Angelo and Rueil at Tattenham corner which ended both colts' chances.\n\nSir Hugo was then sent to Royal Ascot where he started 4/6 favourite for the St. James's Palace Stakes over one mile. He led into the straight but was overtaken in the last quarter mile and finished third behind St Angelo, who won easily by three quarters of a length, and Watercress.\n\nSir Hugo returned on 7 September for the St Leger at Doncaster. He was third choice in the betting behind Orme, who had returned from training problems (he had allegedly been poisoned) to win the Eclipse Stakes and La Fleche, who had won the Oaks two days after her defeat in the Derby. On a wet day in front of a huge crowd, Sir Hugo broke quickly but was then held up as Orme made the early running. Orme was a beaten horse by the time the field turned into the straight when La Fleche went into the lead. Sir Hugo produced a strong finish and ran on in \"dogged fashion\" to prove the best of the colts but could never get on terms with the filly and finished second, beaten two lengths, with Orme well beaten in fifth.\n\nOn 27 September Sir Hugo again challenged La Fleche in the \u00a310,000 Lancashire Plate over one mile at Manchester Racecourse, but was never a threat and finished fifth of the eleven runners At Newmarket on 11 October he produced an excellent performance in defeat in the ten furlong Lowther Stakes, losing by a neck in a \"close set-to\" with El Diablo, to whom he was conceding fifteen pounds. In the Limekiln Stakes over one mile at the Newmarket Houghton meeting, Sir Hugo was provided with a pacemaker named Flank March, but the tactic failed as he was well beaten, finishing third to Orme and El Diablo.\n\n1893: four-year-old season\nSir Hugo was kept in training as a four-year-old and made his debut in a Biennial Stakes over two miles at Newmarket on 20 April. He made the running and after a brief challenge from Barrow, won \"in a canter\" by three lengths. Although the opposition was not strong, he was described as having won \"in the style of a good horse.\"\n\nHe did not stand up to further training and was retired in autumn. It was announced that he would go to stud with a fee of 150 guineas.\n\nAssessment and earnings\nThe general opinion of Sir Hugo during his career was that he had been a sub-standard, and rather fortunate Derby winner. At the end of his three-year-old season one commentator pointed out that although Sir Hugo lacked acceleration (\"that dash of speed\"), he had shown stamina, strength and an \"equable temper\", making him a good stallion prospect.\n\nSir Hugo's win prize money of \u00a36,960 in 1892 placed him fourth on the list of highest earners behind La Fleche, Orme and the two-year-old Milford.\n\nStud career\nSir Hugo was not a success at stud. His best achievement was to sire the mare Ravello, who produced the 2000 Guineas winner Sweeper. His last known foals were conceived in 1906. Sir Hugo died in February 1910 at the Jockey Hall Stud in Curragh.\n\nPedigree\n\nSir Hugo's pedigree contains a notable amount of inbreeding. He was inbred 3 \u00d7 3 to Rataplan, meaning that this horse appears twice in the third generation of his pedigree. Also in the third generation was Rataplan's full brother Stockwell. Sir Hugo was therefore inbred 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4 to both The Baron and Pocahontas.\n\nReferences\n\n1889 racehorse births\n1910 racehorse deaths\nRacehorses trained in the United Kingdom\nRacehorses bred in the United Kingdom\nEpsom Derby winners\nThoroughbred family 19-b", "machine_text": "Sir Hugo (unknown \u2013 1270) was a medieval English nobleman, known for his service to the Crown during the reign of King Henry III of England.

In 1256, he was appointed as Sheriff of Northumberland, a county in the north of England, which was considered a strategic area due to its proximity to the Scottish border. Sir Hugo served in this capacity for at least three years and was responsible for collecting taxes and maintaining law and order in the region. Sir Hugo's most significant involvement in the affairs of the Crown occurred during the Second Barons' War (1264\u20131267), a civil war between King Henry III and his rebellious barons, who sought to limit the King's power. Sir Hugo sided with the royalist faction and fought in several battles, including the Battle of Evesham in 1265, where he reportedly distinguished himself by leading a charge against the rebels, despite being wounded. As a reward for his loyalty and bravery, King Henry III granted Sir Hugo several estates and titles, including the office of Constable of Nottingham Castle, a position he held until his death in 1270. Sir Hugo was also known for his piety and charitable works, having founded a hospital for the poor in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, and endowed several religious institutions, including the Cistercian Abbey of Newminster.

Belonging to the Lentibulariaceae family, this species is also commonly known as Andong Bladderwort. The species was first described by botanist Masahiro Kato in 1988. It is a small and terrestrial plant that derives its name from the presence of small, bladder-like traps called utricles that are found on its roots. These traps are highly specialized and allow the plant to capture small organisms like insect larvae and microorganisms that are present in the soil. The leaves of Utricularia andongensis grow at the base of the plant and are round in shape. The flowers are yellow in color and grow on short stems that arise from the center of the leaves. The plant typically flowers from July to September. One of the interesting features of this plant is the way it reproduces. Like other bladderworts, Utricularia andongensis can produce asexual propagules called turions, which allow the plant to survive unfavorable conditions like winter or drought. These turions can be found growing on the leaves or in the soil nearby the plant. Utricularia andongensis is classified as a threatened species due to habitat loss and degradation. The species is found in forest areas that are being cleared for agriculture and logging, leading to loss of habitat and reduced population sizes.

He struggled for two years and lived at his manager's house, before making his acting debut in 1995, appearing in the CBS drama Picket Fences in the season 4, episode 6 \"Heart of Saturday Night\", where he played Dave Lattimore.\n\nCareer\n\nActing \n\nIn 1998, West guest-starred in several television series including Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and played Mark Tapper in the stage production of The Cider House Rules. He landed his first major role in 1999 in the ABC family drama Once and Again, playing Eli Sammler for three seasons. West's feature film debut was in Liberty Heights, a film about a Jewish family in Baltimore, directed by Barry Levinson. He also co-starred in teen comedies Whatever It Takes (2000) and Get Over It (2001).\n\nWest was cast as Landon Carter opposite singer and actress Mandy Moore in 2002's adaptation of Nicholas Sparks' novel A Walk to Remember.

In October 2008, West returned to ER for three episodes during its fifteenth and final season.\n\nDuring hiatus between seasons of ER, West worked on shooting What We Do Is Secret, an independent film, which premiered at the 2007 Los Angeles Film Festival after much delay. West helped to finance it. In the film, he portrays Darby Crash, a member of the 1970s punk band the Germs. Members of the band were so impressed by West's performance that they re-formed the band with West taking the deceased Crash's place. West received positive reviews for his portrayal in the movie; the San Francisco Chronicle stated that he is the one who \"lifts the entire film to a whole other level\". Similarly, The Seattle Times wrote that his impersonation was \"worth saluting\" while TV Guide called it \"pretty impressive\". In 2008, he received the Rising Star Award in Philadelphia Film Festival for his work in What We Do is Secret.\n\nWest starred as Michael Bishop in The CW spy drama Nikita from 2010 to 2013.

The band was originally known as Average Joe but had to change its name for legal reasons. The band contributed to the A Walk to Remember soundtrack, appearing under the names \"West, Gould, and Fitzgerald\" because they had not yet decided on a new name. West described their style as \"a pop-punk-type band, more Green Day-ish\".\n\nIn November 2005, while What We Do Is Secret was still in production, it was announced that West would be fronting the Germs on tour. He performed with the band for nearly five years, doing an American tour (including the 2006 Warped Tour) and a European Tour. He described the experience as \"more exciting\" than acting. However, after booking a leading role in Nikita, West had less time to play with the band. His last performance was in December 2009.\n\nIn 2015, West reunited with some of his old bandmates from Jonny Was to form a new band called the Twilight Creeps.

This late-1950s to 1960s period was when North Korea had first declared autonomous diplomacy.\n\nDuring the Somali Democratic Republic, relations with North Korea were close, due to shared ideals and geopolitical interests. Both countries formally adhered to anti-imperialism and Marxism\u2013Leninism, and were aligned with the Soviet Union in the context of the wider Cold War. The Supreme Revolutionary Council established relations with the DPRK in 1970. President of Somalia Siad Barre made two visits to Pyongyang during his tenure, once in 1971. He then met with Kim Il-sung, and signed a bilateral agreement of technical and economic assistance.\n\nOver the following years, military cooperation intensified, with North Korea training and equipping the Somali Armed Forces. Additionally, due to a resentment against Ethiopia over the country's involvement in the Korean War, North Korean advisers trained pro-Somalia guerrilla forces active in the Ethiopian\u2013Somali conflict. This changed considerably after the communist Derg came to power in 1974, causing an eventual realignment of Soviet support towards Ethiopia. North Korea followed suit, and provided military aid to Ethiopia against Somalia during the Ethio-Somali War.\n\nAs of March 2014, North Korea and Somalia still officially maintain diplomatic relations according to the National Committee on North Korea.\n\nSee also\nForeign relations of North Korea\nForeign relations of Somalia\nSomalia\u2013South Korea relations\nDai Hong Dan incident\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nDPRK Diplomatic Relations\n\nNorth Korea\nSomalia", "machine_text": "North Korea\u2013Somalia relations, also known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea\u2013Federal Republic of Somalia relations, refer to the bilateral ties between North Korea (DPRK) and Somalia. Both countries established diplomatic relations on July 13, 1960. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union played a significant role in Somalia's foreign policy, providing military and economic aid to the country. However, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Somalia faced a severe economic crisis due to the loss of aid. North Korea, which was also facing economic difficulties after the loss of its traditional allies, saw an opportunity to establish relations with Somalia. In the 1990s, North Korea supplied weapons and military equipment to Somalia, including artillery and rocket systems, anti-aircraft guns, and small arms. In return, Somalia provided North Korea with access to its coastline for North Korean fishing vessels. Despite the sanctions imposed on North Korea by the United Nations, the relationship between the two countries has remained stable. In 2011, a North Korean delegation visited Somalia to explore economic opportunities, including the possibility of developing mineral resources in the country. In recent years, North Korea has provided assistance to Somalia in the areas of agriculture, education, and health care. In 2019, the North Korean government donated $1 million worth of medical supplies to help Somalia combat the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the relationship between North Korea and Somalia has faced criticism from some international observers. In 2017, a United Nations report accused North Korea of violating UN sanctions by providing military technology to Somalia. The report claimed that North Korean agents had operated in Somalia and provided support to the Somali government. Overall, the North Korea\u2013Somalia relationship has been marked by military and economic cooperation, as well as mutual assistance in times of need.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"R\u00fcck's blue flycatcher\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "R\u00fcck's blue flycatcher (Cyornis ruckii) is a passerine bird in the Old World flycatcher family Muscicapidae. It is known from only four specimens and is endemic to a small area in northeast Sumatra, Indonesia, inhabiting primary lowland forest. Although all specimens share common characteristics, such as a black bill, brown iris, and black feet, two of the collected specimens show some physical discrepancy with the other two. They were initially described as Cyornis vanheysti before being accepted as specimens of C. ruckii. R\u00fcck's blue flycatcher has also been compared to other species of Cyornis.\n\nThe species is listed as \"Critically Endangered\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as it has not been recorded since 1918. It has been protected by Indonesian law since 1972. It also might have been affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.\n\nTaxonomy\nR\u00fcck's blue flycatcher was first described by the French zoologist \u00c9mile Oustalet in 1881, who studied two specimens (adult male and female) in the French National Museum of Natural History. The specimens were sent by Monsieur R\u00fcck from a trading port in modern-day Malacca, Malaysia, in 1880. Oustalet named the species after R\u00fcck and gave it the binomial name Cyornis ruckii. The binomial is sometimes emended to the Cyornis rueckii, but this is regarded as an incorrect spelling. Other common names for the species include Rueck's blue flycatcher and Rueck's niltava.\n\nA further two specimens (adult male and immature male) were collected by A. van Heyst in 1917 and 1918 near Medan, where they were subsequently described as a new species (Cyornis vanheysti) by the British zoologists Herbert Robinson and Cecil Kloss in 1919. They also noted their similarity to the specimens described by Oustalet, eventually synonymizing C. vanheysti with C. ruckii. The specimens reside in the American Museum of Natural History.\n\nThe specimens have also been considered as being an aberrant form of the pale blue flycatcher (Cyornis unicolor). However, comparisons show that the pale blue flycatcher is different in both color and . R\u00fcck's blue flycatcher is monotypic.\n\nDescription\nR\u00fcck's blue flycatcher is  in length, with a black bill, brown iris and black feet. Differences between the specimens described by Oustalet and Robinson & Kloss exist. In the Oustalet specimens, the male has dark blue plumage, a blue belly, and a shining blue rump. There is also a small amount of grey coloring on disrupted feathers around the legs. The female has rufous-brown plumage, strong rufous lores, orange-rufous breast and a whitish belly. In the Robinson & Kloss specimens, the immature male has brown-spotted buff plumage with a rufous breast and a whitish center on underparts. The adult male shows some discrepancy with the adult male specimen described by Oustalet; the belly and tail coverts are whitish grey, while the flanks are bluish grey. Additionally, the Robinson & Kloss specimens have slightly larger bills. These differences could be caused by individual variation or due to the specimens being of different subspecies.\n\nDistribution and habitat\nR\u00fcck's blue flycatcher is endemic to Sumatra, Indonesia, around Medan, and presumably has a low population density. The specimens collected by R\u00fcck were from primary lowland forest, while the ones collected by van Heyst are thought to be from exploited forest, which might show possible tolerance against habitat degradation, although this is disputed.\n\nConservation\nLast recorded in 1918, and due to ongoing habitat loss, poor surveying, and its small population and limited range, R\u00fcck's blue flycatcher is evaluated as \"Critically Endangered\" on the IUCN Red List. It is listed in Appendix II of CITES and has been protected under Indonesian law since 1972. In 2013 and 2014, observations in Jambi, Sumatra, revealed a pair of unidentified flycatchers that resembled R\u00fcck's blue flycatcher, but the possibility of them being white-tailed flycatchers (Cyornis concretus) could not be eliminated. R\u00fcck's blue flycatcher might have been affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, and is also predicted to be extinct with 80% confidence.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n BirdLife Species Factsheet\n Red Data Book\n\nR\u00fcck's blue flycatcher\nBirds of Sumatra\nCritically endangered fauna of Asia\nR\u00fcck's blue flycatcher", "machine_text": "R\u00fcck's blue flycatcher (Cyornis ruckii) is a species of bird in the family Muscicapidae, native to Southeast Asia. This flycatcher is named after German ornithologist Carl R\u00fcck (1875-1943), who collected the type specimen on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia in 1911. R\u00fcck's blue flycatcher is a small bird, measuring about 14 cm in length. It is blue-grey on the head, back, wings, and tail, with a chestnut-brown throat and breast and white underparts. The male has a darker blue crown and a brighter blue rump than the female. The bird's bill is black, and its legs and feet are pale pink. This species of flycatcher is found in humid tropical forests, montane forests, and secondary growth habitats in Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, and the Philippines. Its diet mostly consists of insects, which are caught by making short flights from perch to perch and then using a quick aerial strike to catch prey. R\u00fcck's blue flycatcher is known for its attractive song, which consists of a rapid set of whistles and trills. It is known to breed from March to June, constructing a cup-shaped nest made of leaves, moss, and rootlets in a tree or shrub. This bird is considered to be of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) due to its widespread distribution and stable population. However, habitat loss and degradation caused by deforestation and agriculture may be a threat to its survival in some areas.

He was also noted for his performance in literary face-offs known as Kavigan.\n\nBiography\nBorn Hensman Anthony, the sobriquet Firingee (The foreigner of European origin) was used colloquially as a reference to his Portuguese origins. Although not much is known of his early life, Anthony arrived in Bengal sometime in early 19th century and subsequently came to settle in Farashdanga, in the town of Chandannagar in West Bengal.\n\nHe married a Hindu Brahmin widow named Saudamini and was deeply influenced by Bengali culture and language, as well as the Hindu religion. Eventually, Anthony came to learn the language and composed a number of noted religious songs in devotion to the Goddesses Kali and Durga. He is noted for his Agamani Songs, celebrating the return of Goddess Durga to her parents home that marks the Bengali Autumn festival of Durga Puja. Anthony is also noted for his literary face-offs in Kavigans, or Bard's duels, with a number of noted Bengali composers including Bhola Moira, Ram Basu and Thakur Singha. Anthony also helped construct a temple to Goddess Kali in the Bowbazar locality of Central Calcutta known as 'Firinghi Kalibari'. His wife Saudamini was burnt to death, for being a widow and remarrying Anthony, who was a foreigner.\n\nIn popular culture\n Books\nThe first reference to Anthony Firingee is a novel by Madan Bandopadhay titled Kabiyal Anthony Firingee.\n\n Films\n A 1967 Bengali film by director Sunil Bannerjee portrayed the life and works of Anthony, and had Bengali actor Uttam Kumar in the title role. The film was noted for its music, composed by Anil Bagchi & lyrics by Gouri Prasanna Majumdar among others and earned Uttam Kumar an Indian National Film Award for Best Actor in 1968.\n A 2014 adaptation by director Srijit Mukherji titled Jaatishwar featured the life of Anthony from a retrospective view but with a modern-day context. Jaatishwar also received an Indian National Film Awards in 2014, in four categories, including Best singer and Best Music Director.\n\nReferences\n\n Miah S and Islam S.

Born in Portuguese-occupied Bengal in 1786, Firingee was known for his proficiency in both Portuguese and Bengali languages, which he used to compose several Bengali songs. Firingee was of mixed parentage, with his father being Portuguese and his mother Bengali. He grew up in a multicultural environment and learned the nuances of both Bengali and Portuguese traditions. Firingee started his career as a sailor, but his passion for music soon took over, and he became a full-time musician. Firingee's music was unique, as it reflected his mixed heritage. He composed several songs that were a blend of Bengali and Portuguese folk music, which became popular among the masses. Some of his notable works include \"Banishree Prodeep\", \"Eso Shyamol Sundoro\", \"Phulia Chor\", and \"Jhor Jhor Brishti\". Firingee's musical talents earned him great recognition during his time. He was invited to perform at several royal courts, including the court of the Nawab of Murshidabad and the Maharaja of Gwalior. Additionally, he sang at the famous 19th-century festival called Poush Mela. Firingee's personal life was also fascinating, as he was known for his romantic liaisons. He had a reputation as a ladies' man and was often seen flirting with women in public places.

For his activities, he earned the nickname \"God's Smuggler\". He is known for having prayed \"Lord, make seeing eyes blind\" when he was stopped at the border of a communist country for his car to be inspected.\n\nBiography\nVan der Bijl was born in Sint Pancras, the Netherlands, the fourth of six children of a poor, near-deaf blacksmith and an invalid mother. He told John and Elizabeth Sherrill, when they transcribed his memories for their book God's Smuggler, \"From the day I first put on wooden shoes \u2013 klompen we call them in Holland \u2013 I dreamed of derring-do\".\n\nIn the 1940s, he enlisted in the colonial army of the Dutch East Indies during the rebellion that would eventually form Indonesia, which first adventure initially had unpleasant results; he endured a period of severe emotional stress while he was serving as a soldier. He was wounded in the ankle during the fighting; during his rehabilitation, he read the Bible obsessively, eventually converting to Christianity. Van der Bijl studied at the WEC Missionary Training College in Glasgow, Scotland.\n\nMinistry\nIn July 1955, Andrew van der Bijl visited Communist Poland \"to see how my brothers are doing\", a reference to the underground church there. He signed up on a government-controlled Communist tour, the only legal way to be in the country. During that time, he felt called to respond to the Biblical Commission, \"Wake up, strengthen what remains and is about to die\" (). That was the start of a mission leading him into several communist-ruled countries in which religious belief was actively persecuted.\nIn 1957, he travelled to the Soviet Union\u2019s capital, Moscow, in a Volkswagen Beetle, which later became the symbol of Open Doors, the organization he founded. An older couple, the Whetstras, had given him their new car because they had prayed about it and believed that Andrew would need the car. A man who lived in Amersfoort, Karl de Graaf, claimed that God told him to teach Van der Bijl to drive. Later, when Van der Bijl was in a refugee camp in West Germany, Philip Whetstra called Van der Bijl to come to the Whetstras' new house in Amsterdam. Although Van der Bijl was violating the laws of all of the countries that he visited by bringing religious literature, he often placed the material in view when he was stopped at police checkpoints, as a gesture of his trust in what he believed to be God's protection. That was the realization of his childhood dreams of derring-do.\n\nVan der Bijl visited China in  the 1960s, after the Cultural Revolution had created a hostile policy towards Christianity and other religions, during the so-called Bamboo Curtain. He went to Czechoslovakia when the suppression by Soviet troops of the Prague Spring had put an end to relative religious freedom there. He encouraged Czech believers and gave Bibles to the Russian occupying forces. During that decade, he also made his first visits to Cuba after the Cuban Revolution.\n\nGod's Smuggler\nIn 1967, he published the first edition of God's Smuggler, written with John and Elizabeth Sherrill. God's Smuggler tells the story of his early childhood, conversion to Christianity, and adventures as a Bible-smuggler behind the Iron Curtain. By 2002, it had sold over 10 million copies in thirty-five languages. A comic book adaptation of God's Smuggler was published in 1972 by Spire Christian Comics.\n\nMiddle East\nAfter the fall of Communism in Europe, he shifted his focus to the Middle East and has worked to strengthen the church in the Muslim world. In the 1970s, he visited war-torn Lebanon several times, stating that \"global conflict in the end times will focus on Israel and its neighbouring countries.\"\n\nLight Force and Secret Believers\nIn the 1990s, van der Bijl again travelled several times more to the Middle East. In his book Light Force, he tells of Arab and Lebanese churches in Lebanon, Israel and Israeli-occupied areas expressing great delight at the mere visit of a fellow Christian from abroad since they felt that the church in the Western world at large was largely ignoring them.\n\nIn similar fashion, van der Bijl and a companion, Al Janssen, visited Hamas and PLO leaders, including Ahmed Yassin and Yasser Arafat, and handed out Bibles.\n\nVan der Bijl's tenth book, Secret Believers: What Happens When Muslims Believe in Christ, was released on 1 July 2007.\n\nBibliography\n\nSee also\nOpen Doors\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nShort biography\nOpen Doors International Website\nCo-author of God's Smuggler talks about writing with such heroes as Brother Andrew\n\nBible smuggling\nDutch anti-communists\nDutch Christian missionaries\nDutch evangelicals\nLiving people\nRoyal Netherlands East Indies Army personnel\n1928 births\nDutch expatriates in the United Kingdom", "machine_text": "Andrew van der Bijl, also known as Brother Andrew, is a Dutch Christian missionary and evangelist who is best known for his work during the Cold War in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.

After his military service, he worked as a salesman for a textile company, but he felt that his life lacked purpose. In 1955, Van der Bijl traveled to East Germany to smuggle Bibles to Christian believers who were in desperate need of them. This marked the beginning of his lifelong mission to bring the Gospel to people in closed countries. During the Cold War, Van der Bijl smuggled Bibles and other Christian literature into communist countries including Poland, Romania, Hungary, and the Soviet Union. He became known as \"God's Smuggler\" for his risky activities. Van der Bijl's work inspired the creation of Open Doors, a nonprofit organization dedicated to serving persecuted Christians around the world. He also founded the international ministry, which focuses on providing support to the suffering church worldwide. Van der Bijl has written many books, including his autobiography \"God's Smuggler\", which has been translated into many languages and has sold over 15 million copies worldwide. The book recounts his remarkable experiences as a missionary in communist countries and how he relied on God's strength to overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles. Van der Bijl retired from his active duties in 1998, but his legacy continues today through the ministry he founded, which now operates in more than sixty countries.

It was developed by the French defence company Thales in the late 1990s and is currently used by the French and Italian armed forces. How it works The Graves system consists of two main parts: a radar transmitter and a network of receiver stations. The transmitter, located in southern France, emits pulses of radio waves that reflect off objects in the atmosphere, such as aircraft and missiles. These reflections are then picked up by the receiver stations, which are distributed throughout Europe to cover a wide area. By analyzing the time it takes for the radio waves to travel from the transmitter to the object and back to the receiver, the Graves system can determine the object's position and speed. This information is then transmitted to a central command center, where it is used to coordinate military operations and track potential threats. Capabilities The Graves system is capable of tracking objects up to an altitude of 20,000 meters (65,000 feet) and at a range of up to 1,500 kilometers (930 miles). It can detect objects as small as a bird and as fast as a ballistic missile. This makes it an invaluable tool for air defense and early warning systems. In addition to its primary use in military operations, the Graves system has also been used for scientific research, particularly in the field of meteorology. The system can detect and track atmospheric phenomena such as thunderstorms and auroras, allowing scientists to better understand the Earth's upper atmosphere. Future developments Thales is currently working on an upgrade to the Graves system, known as Graves NG (Next Generation). This new system will feature higher resolution and faster processing times, allowing it to track multiple objects simultaneously with greater accuracy. It will also be compatible with other European military systems, allowing for better coordination between allied forces. The Graves NG system is expected to enter service in the early 2020s.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 11730273}

The catchment area of the reservoir spans across the three states of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka. The primary objective of the dam is to provide water for irrigation and power generation. The dam's power station has a capacity of 3 megawatts, and the energy produced is supplied to Kerala State Electricity Board. The dam also provides drinking water to the nearby towns of Palakkad and Coimbatore. The reservoir created by the dam has helped in regulating the flow of the Parambikulam river and has facilitated the cultivation of crops such as paddy, sugarcane, and bananas in the surrounding areas. The dam also plays a crucial role in supporting the biodiversity of the region by providing ample water resources for the wildlife. The Parambikulam Dam is surrounded by the Parambikulam Wildlife Sanctuary, which is a part of the Anamalai Tiger Reserve. The sanctuary is known for its diverse flora and fauna and is home to many endangered species such as tigers, gaurs, and sloth bears. Tourists can visit the dam and the sanctuary and indulge in activities such as jungle safaris, trekking, and bird watching. The dam and the surrounding areas have been developed as a popular tourist destination by the Kerala state government. In conclusion, Parambikulam Dam is a vital infrastructure project that has provided water resources for irrigation and power generation. The dam has also helped in the conservation of the region's biodiversity and is a popular tourist destination.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 7504905}

The car was known by its name Typ 320 at the time of its production and service, but is in retrospect commonly referred to using its Mercedes-Benz works number, \"W142\", which gives a more unambiguously unique nomenclature.\n\nMercedes-Benz Typ 320 n (Works number W142/I)  1937\u20131938 \nThe standard-wheelbase version of the W142 shared its  wheelbase with the standard lengthened versions of its predecessor, but a more streamlined form with longer overhangs meant that even in this form the W142 was substantially longer and indeed wider than the earlier car. The front grill was gently raked backwards, and there was no longer a bar in front of it to carry lights, all of which gave the car a more sporting look than the model it replaced.\n\nPower came from a newly enlarged straight six 3,208 cc side-valve engine with a listed maximum output of  at 4,000 rpm, supporting a claimed top speed of 130\u00a0km/h (81\u00a0mph). This was delivered to the rear wheels via a four-speed manual transmission which, unusually in the 1930s, incorporated synchromesh on all four ratios. The footbrake used a hydraulic control mechanism and operated on all four wheels. The suspension set-up was carried over from the W18 with a swing axle at the rear and the front axle suspended with a central transverse leaf spring and coil springs beside the wheels.\n\nCustomers wishing to make their own arrangements in respect of bodywork could buy a standard-wheelbase W142 in base chassis form at the manufacturer's listed price of 6,500 Marks. Otherwise the choice of standard bodies was restricted to a three-seat cabriolet (known as the \"Cabriolet A\") or a coup\u00e9-bodied equivalent with a removable roof, priced respectively at 11,800 Marks or 12,300 Marks.\n\nMercedes-Benz Typ 320 (Works number W142/II)  1937\u20131938 \nLonger-bodied cars came with an extra  of wheelbase, and Mercedes-Benz offered a choice from a wide range of standard body options for the longer cars.\n\nCustomers happy to make their own arrangements in respect of bodywork could buy a longer-wheelbase W142 in base chassis form at the manufacturer's listed price of 6,800 Marks, or 300 Marks more than the price of the shorter chassis. The entry level model with a Mercedes-Benz body included in the price was the four-door \u201dLimousine\u201d (sedan/saloon) at 8,950 Marks. There were no fewer than four cabriolet-bodied versions of the longer-wheelbase car offered, being a two-door 2/3-seater (\"Cabriolet A\"), a two-door 4-seater with four side-windows (\"Cabriolet B\"), a four-door 4-seater (\"Cabriolet D\") and a very substantial-looking four-door 6-seater with three rows of seats (\"Pullman-Cabriolet F\"). Other soft-topped standard-bodied versions were a Torpedo-bodied 6-seater \"Tourenwagen\" and a sporty 2-seater Roadster. There was also a six-seater \u201cPullman-Limousine\u201d with three rows of seats and six side windows under a conventional steel roof. The rear seat of the Pullman-bodied cars was above the back axle, and an extra luggage locker at the back left the overall length of the Pullman-Limousine at , still using the  wheelbase. The highest listed price for a Mercedes-Benz-bodied W142 was 14,500 Marks for a \"Stromlinien-Limousine\" featuring a strikingly modern exceptionally streamlined steel body.\n\nMercedes-Benz Typ 320 (Works number W142/III)  1937\u20131939 \nThe short-wheelbase version of the car was also the basis for a \"Wehrmachtsk\u00fcbelwagen\" (military vehicle), one of several such vehicles which may have provided inspiration for the subsequent (1941) Jeep. The W142 \u201cK\u00fcbelwagen\u201d retained the frontal style of the car on which it was based, but with a horizontal bar ahead of the front grill on which to mount lights. It had four front-hinged doors, a canvas top and wide-tread tyres for rough terrain. In this form the vehicle came with a listed top speed of 118\u00a0km/h (73\u00a0mph).\n\nMercedes-Benz Typ 320 (Works number W142/IV)  1938\u20131942 \nIn 1938 the manufacturer increased the cylinder bore to , thereby increasing the engine capacity to 3,405 cc. Nevertheless, the cars retained the \"Typ 320\" designation. There was also no change in the power output, still listed at  at 4,000 rpm, and there were no claims of improved performance. Instead the compression ratio was lowered in anticipation of future shortages enforcing the use of fuel synthesized from coal which was expected to have a lower octane rating than the \u201cnormal\u201d fuel used at the time. The larger-engined car also came with an overdrive ratio (1 : 0.73) added to the hitherto four-speed gear box which the car had featured since launch.\n\nIn 1939 the larger engine was also used in the W142/III K\u00fcbelwagen, this time accompanied by a small increase in maximum output to  and an accompanying reassurance that the top speed was undiminished.\n\nCommercial\nBetween 1937 and 1942 Mercedes-Benz produced 4,326 of the 3,208\u00a0cc cars and 885 of the 3,405\u00a0cc cars.\n\nProduction of a further 1,806 W142 based military K\u00fcbelwagen between 1938 and 1940 is also recorded.\n\nSee also\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n \n\nThis entry incorporates information from the equivalent German Wikipedia entry.\n\nExternal links\n \n\nW142\nW142\nRear-wheel-drive vehicles\nSedans\n1930s cars", "machine_text": "The Mercedes-Benz W142, also known as the Typ 320, was a luxury car produced by Mercedes-Benz between 1937 and 1942.

The W142 was powered by a 3.2-liter six-cylinder engine that produced 80 horsepower, which was a significant increase from its predecessor, the W18. The car was also equipped with independent suspension, hydraulic brakes, and a four-speed manual transmission, making it a very advanced vehicle for its time. In terms of design, the W142 had a sleek and elegant appearance and featured many of the signature design elements that have become synonymous with Mercedes-Benz. This included a signature chrome grille, rounded fenders, and a long hood that added to the car's classic aesthetic. The W142 also had some technological advancements, such as the option for a Becker-Mexico radio with a shortwave receiver, which was a cutting-edge feature for car radios in the 1930s.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Gerolstein, whose seat is in the like-named town.\n\nGeography \n\nThe municipality lies in the Vulkaneifel, a part of the Eifel known for its volcanic history, geographical and geological features, and even ongoing activity today, including gases that sometimes well up from the earth. Hohenfels-Essingen lies in the Hangelsbach valley framed by the Feuerberg (588\u00a0m), the Alter Vo\u00df (588 m, with \u201cLiberation Beech\u201d) and the M\u00fchlenberg (585 m, with its well-known millstone quarries).\n\nHistory \nAs witnessed by archaeological finds, Hohenfels was already settled in Roman and Frankish times and in 948, it had its first documentary mention. Essingen was first mentioned in a document in 1193 as an estate belonging to the Sankt Thomas Monastery.\n\nRomans and Franks \nIn the late 2nd century, the Romans came into the west Eifel. Roman troops found natives who worked at cropraising, but who were so small in number that they only occupied a relatively small area. With the systematic opening of the land with military roads and the attendant onset of regional and even national trade opportunities, land clearing was begun in these lands, which were particularly good for cropraising. The land each side of the roads was overlaid with a network of estates that were run both as state and private enterprises. Some of the most important Roman roads ran over the northern heights of Hohenfels and through the Kyll valley north of Trier.\n\nIn the district Im Keller (\u201cIn the Cellar\u201d) in Hohenfels, the remnants of a portico villa were found during building excavations in 1957. Only about 200 metres away in 1914 in the rural cadastral area Auf Grafenfeld in Hohenfels, two Roman graves were unearthed and salvaged for the Rheinisches Landesmuseum Trier.\n\nThe great Germanic taking of the land between 400 and 600 destroyed Roman culture and brought the area into the \u201carmy kings\u2019\u201d (Heerk\u00f6nige) hands. The people who had lived here until now \u2013 Romanized Celts and Romans \u2013 either fled or were subdued. The Frankish kings dealt the formerly Roman estates out to their warriors. In Hohenfels, an old settlement founded by the Franks can be found right near the Roman portico villa. In Auf Grafenfeld, a great burying ground from Frankish times was unearthed and explored in 1912: 125 Frankish graves from the 4th to 8th centuries.\n\n15th to 17th centuries \nEven before the Thirty Years' War, the M\u00fchlenberg was riven with galleries in which millstones were being produced. As protection, in particular against Swedish troops, these galleries and caves were expanded and then used to shelter livestock. For a water supply, great basins were hewn in lava blocks, which could hold up to 300 litres of water. Water was to be had from a spring outlet on the mountain\u2019s south slope.\n\nAfter the Thirty Years\u2019 War, the land had been laid waste and the people impoverished. Moreover, there were sicknesses like the Plague and cholera. From this time come seven wayside crosses hewn from basalt in the vicinity of Hohenfels. Each Sunday, the whole village would make a pilgrimage by the crosses, asking for an end to the Plague. In the 1960s, the crosses were put up by the municipality along the way to the grotto on the M\u00fchlberg. Further destruction was brought in 1688 by the Nine Years' War (known in Germany as the Pf\u00e4lzischer Erbfolgekrieg, or War of the Palatine Succession), in which castles, churches and monasteries were destroyed.\n\n18th and 19th centuries \nAs a result of the French Revolution, the French came into the Eifel. Hohenfels was then owned by the Count of Metternich, who was stripped of his holdings in 1808. The Hohenfels mill, which also belonged to the Count, was sold for 1,200 francs (then equivalent to 380 Taler). Likewise, each one of the Count's landholdings was auctioned off one by one.\n\nIn November 1817, the Eifel was annexed to the state of Prussia and thenceforth belonged to the newly founded Rhine Province with its seat  in D\u00fcsseldorf. In the 19th century, an average of 140 people lived in Hohenfels. The main livelihood was smallholdings. There were also family businesses in curbstone and millstone making, and in making roadbuilding materials. These products were shipped out over the Eifel by teams of horses and sold. Some of the millstones were shipped to Belgium and thence throughout the world. These family businesses ceased during the First World War.\n\nIn 1860, the Eifel's biggest lava deposit \u2013 the Feuerberg in Hohenfels \u2013 was leased by the municipality for lava mining. The lava was used for road and railway building.\n\n20th century to present \n\nAfter the First World War, in November 1918, American troops were in the village. Later on came French occupational troops as part of the Allied occupation of the Rhineland.\n\nIn the 1920s, basalt mining began beneath the M\u00fchlenberg. In the area around Hohenfels, a firm from Mayen was making runner stones and shipping them worldwide. In 1928 above the cadastral area of \u201cWahlend\u201d, a gravelworks was built, remaining in operation until 1974. For a time, more than 100 people were employed here.\n\nIn the course of administrative reform, the two self-administering municipalities of Hohenfels and Essingen were merged on 1 January 1968 into a single municipality.\n\nPolitics\n\nMunicipal council \nThe council is made up of 8 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.\n\nCoat of arms \nThe German blazon reads: In Silber ein schr\u00e4glinkes, rotes Schwert, begleitet oben von einer blauen Urne, unten von einem gr\u00fcnen M\u00fchlstein.\n\nThe municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Argent a sword bendwise sinister gules, the point to chief, between an urn azure and a millstone vert.\n\nThe red sword stands for the execution place of the Electoral-Trier Amt of Daun between Hohenfels and Essingen on the old Roman road, marked on the map of the Amt of Daun in 1683 with a gallows symbol. The blue urn refers to the great Frankish burying ground with 125 graves and the important finds therefrom. The green millstone refers to the Hohenfels millstone quarry, already widely known in the Middle Ages, and further for the landscape in both constituent centres, which is characterized by volcanism, and where there is even today lava and basalt quarrying.\n\nCulture and sightseeing \n The grotto at the M\u00fchlenberg\n Millstone caves\n Basalt deposits\n Hiking trails\n\nBuildings\n\nEssingen \n Saint Hubert\u2019s Catholic Church (branch church; Filialkirche St. Hubertus), Bergstra\u00dfe 10, biaxial aisleless church, 1886.\n Bergstra\u00dfe 1 \u2013 Quereinhaus (a combination residential and commercial house divided for these two purposes down the middle, perpendicularly to the street), from 1783, old cobbles in yard.\n Bergstra\u00dfe 2 \u2013 house from 1816, commercial building, some old cobbles in yard, whole complex.\n Wayside cross, southwest of the village on the road to Rockeskyll, cast-iron crucifix, about 1900.\n Wayside cross, west of the village at a hairpin bend in the road, a basalt beam cross from 1749 (?).\n\nHohenfels \n Catholic church, Gerolsteiner Stra\u00dfe 6, four-axis Gothic Revival aisleless church from 1894.\n Before Am M\u00fchlenberg 6 \u2013 wayside cross, basalt shaft cross from 1687.\n Schulstra\u00dfe, graveyard, warriors\u2019 memorial 1914\u20131918, Crucifixion group, praying soldier, from 1922.\n Wayside cross, north of the village at the M\u00fchlenberg at the lower hairpin bend, basalt shaft cross from 1719.\n\nClubs \n Freizeit- und Sportverein Hohenfels-Essingen e.V.

Total reserves of the field have been put at 4.9 billion barrels.\n\nProduction history\nThe Ku field was discovered in 1980, the Maloob field in 1984 and Zaap in 1991. First oil from the Ku field was produced in 1981.\n\nThe KMZ development included drilling 82 wells, four of which are nitrogen injectors and installation of 17 oil platforms: seven drilling, four production, four accommodation, one telecommunication and one processing.  There are 42 oil pipelines of  to transport the oil produced. It was expected that by 2011, production would reach  of oil and  of natural gas.\n\nThis target was met by November 2009 when oil production reached . The field produced  crude oil in 2010. Production rose to  in November 2015. This new rate of production and the decline in production at the Cantarell Field made Ku-Maloob-Zaap Mexico's most productive oil field.\n\nKMZ is among the company\u2019s most profitable producing assets, according to Welligence Energy Analytics. Pemex reported average production costs of $10.37/boe at KMZ as of end-2019.\n\nOn 2 July 2021, Mexico's state-owned oil company PEMEX suffered an undersea gas pipeline rupture in the Ku-Maloob-Zaap field. The leak and subsequent fire lasted for five hours.\n\nProduction decline\nProduction in the Ku-Maloob-Zaap fields has entered a declining phase. Production declined to  in July 2019. Subsequently production plunged to  in July 2020. The uncertainty created by Covid-19 contributed to the decline in production.\n\nTo maintain production in the Ku Maloob Zaap field, PEMEX has adopted techniques such as management of production limits and nitrogen injection.\n\nSee also\n\n List of oil fields\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nProyecto Ku-Maloob-Zaap, en la Sonda de Campeche\n\nOil fields in Mexico\nPemex\nGulf Coast of Mexico\nPetroleum industry in the Gulf of Mexico\nGeography of Campeche", "machine_text": "Ku-Maloob-Zaap, also known as KMZ, is a large offshore oil field located in the southern Gulf of Mexico. The field is located about 105 miles (170 kilometers) off the coast of the state of Campeche and is operated by Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos (Pemex). The discovery of the field in 1979 made it the largest oil discovery in Mexico at the time. The field consists of multiple reservoirs that contain heavy and medium crude oil. The crude oil produced from KMZ is transported to the Pemex refining complex in Cadereyta, Nuevo Le\u00f3n, and is also exported to customers in the United States and around the world. In recent years, KMZ has been a key focus for Pemex as the company has worked to increase production from the field. In 2019, Pemex announced a $7.3 billion investment plan to increase production at KMZ by 300,000 barrels of oil per day within five years. The development of KMZ has not been without controversy. In 2015, an explosion on an offshore platform operated by Pemex at the KMZ field killed four workers and injured several others. The disaster led to scrutiny of Pemex's safety practices and raised concerns about the company's ability to safely operate in the Gulf of Mexico. Despite these challenges, KMZ remains a critical asset for Pemex and for the Mexican economy as a whole. The field is responsible for a significant portion of Mexico's oil production and plays a key role in supporting the country's energy industry.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 11470028}

However, by the late 20th century it had largely fallen into disuse, part of the reason being that it is unwieldy to play. Also, the fact that (like other instruments in the huqin family) the bow passes between the instrument's two strings means that playing pizzicato is difficult; thus, the larger four-string gehu and diyingehu (or cello or double bass) are generally used in Chinese orchestras for the lower bowed string voices instead.\n\nSee also\nDahu (instrument)\nDiyingehu\nLaruan\nHuqin\nTraditional Chinese musical instruments\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nDihu page (Chinese)\nXiaodihu photo (xiaodihu on left; erhu on right for comparison)\nZhongdihu photo (zhongdihu on left; erhu on right for comparison)\nDadihu photo (dadihu on left; erhu on right for comparison)\n\nBowed instruments\nChinese musical instruments\nDrumhead lutes\nHuqin family instruments", "machine_text": "Dihu is a stringed musical instrument from China.

The sound of the Dihu can be described as bright and resonant, and it is often used to accompany Chinese opera and regional folk songs. The Dihu has a long history in China, with evidence of its use dating back to the Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD). The instrument was originally used in court and religious music, but later became popular in folk music. In the 20th century, the Dihu underwent a transformation, with improvements made in the materials and design of the instrument. This led to a resurgence in its popularity, and the instrument is now widely used in Chinese music. The Dihu is made of a cylindrical soundbox that is made from bamboo or wood, with a length of approximately 30 \u2013 35 centimeters. The soundboard is made from snake skin, and the bridge and tailpiece are made from hardwood. The bow used to play the Dihu is similar to that used in the erhu, which is another Chinese bowed instrument. The Dihu has a range of approximately two octaves, and the player uses their fingers to create vibrato and other expressive techniques. It is often used to play melodic lines or to provide a drone accompaniment to other instruments or singers. The Dihu has been popularized in recent years by musicians such as Liu Fang and Wu Man, who have brought the instrument to a wider audience through their performances and recordings.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Transport Canada\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Transport Canada () is the department within the Government of Canada responsible for developing regulations, policies and services of road, rail, marine and air transportation in Canada. It is part of the Transportation, Infrastructure and Communities (TIC) portfolio. The current Minister of Transport is Omar Alghabra. Transport Canada is headquartered in Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nHistory\nThe Department of Transport was created in 1935 by the government of William Lyon Mackenzie King in recognition of the changing transportation environment in Canada at the time. It merged three departments: the former Department of Railways and Canals, the Department of Marine, and the Civil Aviation Branch of the Department of National Defence (c. 1927 when it replaced the Air Board) under C. D. Howe, who would use the portfolio to rationalize the governance and provision of all forms of transportation (air, water and land).  He created a National Harbours Board and Trans-Canada Air Lines.  The Department of Transport Act came into force November 2, 1936.\n\nPrior to a 1994 federal government reorganization, Transport Canada had a wide range of operational responsibilities including the Canadian Coast Guard, the Saint Lawrence Seaway, airports and seaports, as well as Via Rail and CN Rail. Significant cuts to Transport Canada at that time resulted in CN Rail being privatized, the coast guard being transferred to Fisheries and Oceans, and the seaway and various ports and airports being transferred to local operating authorities. Transport Canada emerged from this process as a department focused on policy and regulation rather than transportation operations.\n\nIn 2004, Transport Canada introduced non-passenger screening to enhance both airport and civil aviation security.\n\nHeadquarters\nTransport Canada's headquarters are located in Ottawa at Place de Ville, Tower C. Transport Canada also has regional headquarters in:\n\n Vancouver \u2013 Government of Canada Building, 820-800 Burrard Street\n Edmonton \u2013 Canada Place, 9700 Jasper Avenue NW\n Winnipeg \u2013 Macdonald Building, 344 Edmonton Street\n Toronto \u2013 Government of Canada Building, 4900 Yonge Street\n Montreal \u2013 Pierre Elliott Trudeau Airport, 700 Place Leigh-Capreol\n Moncton \u2013 Heritage Building, 95 Foundry Street\n\nStructure\nMinister of Transport Omar Alghabra\nDeputy Minister, Transport Canada Michael Keenan\nAssociate Deputy Minister, Arun Thangaraj\nAssistant Deputy Minister, Safety and Security, Kevin Brousseau\nAssociate Assistant Deputy Minister, Safety and Security, Aaron McCrorie\nAssistant Deputy Minister, Programs, Anuradha Marisetti\nAssistant Deputy Minister, Policy, Craig Hutton (Acting)\nAssistant Deputy Minister, Corporate Services, Ryan Pilgrim\nChief Digital Officer, Julie Lesse\nExecutive Head, Oceans Protection Plan, Jane Weldon\nDirector General, Communications, Jacqueline Roy\nChief Audit and Evaluation Executive, Chantal Roy\nDepartmental General Counsel, Alain Langlois\nRegional Director General, Atlantic Region, Ann Mowatt\nRegional Director General, Quebec Region, Joanna Manger\nRegional Director General, Ontario Region, Duwayne Williams\nRegional Director General, Prairie and Northern Region, Shari Currie\nAssistant Deputy Minister, Pacific Region, Robert Dick\n\nEnforcement\n\nTransport Canada is responsible for enforcing several Canadian legislation, including the Aeronautics Act, Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act, Motor Vehicle Safety Act, Canada Transportation Act, Railway Safety Act, Canada Shipping Act, 2001, Marine Transportation Security Act amongst others. Each inspector with delegated power from the Minister of Transport receives official credentials to exercise their power, as shown on the right. These inspectors are public officers identified within the Criminal Code of Canada.\n\nRoad\n\nThe Motor Vehicle Safety Act was established in 1971 in order to create safety standards for cars in Canada. The department also acts as the federal government's funding partner with provincial (and territorial) transport ministries on jointly-funded provincial transportation infrastructure projects for new highways.\n\nTC also manage a database of traffic collisions in Canada.\n\nRail\n\nTransport Canada's role in railways include:\n\n railway safety\n surface and intermodal security\n strategies for rail travel accessibility\n safety of federally regulated railway bridges\n safety and security of international bridges and tunnels (US/CAN border)\n Inspecting and testing traffic control signals, grade crossing warning systems\n rail operating rules\n regulations, standards and services for safe transport of dangerous goods\n Canadian Transport Emergency Centre to assist emergency response and handling dangerous goods emergencies\n\nFollowing allegations by shippers of service level deterioration, on April 7, 2008, the federal government of Canada launched a review of railway freight service within the country. Transport Canada, which is managing the review, plans to investigate the relationships between Canadian shippers and the rail industry, especially with regards to the two largest railroad companies in the country, Canadian Pacific Railway and Canadian National Railway.\nOn June 26, 2013, the Fair Rail Freight Service Act became law which was a response to the Rail Freight Service Review's Final Report.\n\nMarine\n\nTransport Canada is responsible for the waterways inside and surrounding Canada. These responsibilities include:\n\n responding and investigating marine accidents within Canadian waters\n enforcing marine acts and regulations such as the Canada Marine Act\n establishing and enforcing marine personnel standards and pilotage\n Marine Safety\n Marine Security\n regulating the operation of marine vessels in Canadian waters\n\nAs of 2003 the Office of Boating Safety and the Navigable Waters Protection Program were transferred back to Transport Canada. As was certain regulatory aspects of Emergency Response (Oil pollution)\n\nTransport Canada Marine Safety (TCMS) is the division under Transport Canada that maintains and enhances marine safety and work to protect life, health, property and the marine environment. This includes providing services that are mandated by acts and regulations such as certification for Canadian seafarers and related professionals.\n\nAviation\n\nTransport Canada's role in aviation is the most detailed. Until 1996, Transport Canada was responsible for both regulation of aviation and the operation of air traffic services, as well as the operation of most major airports. On November 1, 1996, these responsibilities were split: Transport Canada remains responsible for regulation (through the Canadian Aviation Regulations (CARs) and Standards), and a new regulated non-profit company, NAV CANADA, took over responsibility for all civilian air traffic services. This change was (and remains) controversial within the private aviation sector because NAV CANADA began charging for services that were previously funded through a specific tax on aviation gasoline.  The specific tax remains but separate charges are levied by NAV CANADA.\nIn 2005, the United States was discussing a similar delegation of the FAA's air traffic services to an \"arm's-length\" government corporation.\n\nDuring the 1990s, Transport Canada also began privatizing the operation of large airports, and divesting itself of small airports altogether (typically handing them over to municipalities). Following the 1994 National Airports Policy, Transport Canada retains ownership of most airports with 200,000 or more annual passenger movements, as well as the primary airports serving the federal, provincial, and territorial capitals, but leases most of these airports (which make up the National Airports System) to outside operators; currently, there are 26 airports in the system, of which 22 are operated by 21 Airport Authorities, an example of which is the Greater Toronto Airports Authority.\n\nIn 2003, Transport Canada launched its Electronic Collection of Air Transportation Statistics program to collect passenger and cargo data in real-time from air carriers flying in Canada. ECATS will expand into the field of general aviation during 2008.   collects data on all accidents and incidents, no matter how minor, using the Civil Aviation Daily Occurrence Reporting System (CADORS).\n\nTransport Canada continues to be responsible for licensing pilots and other aviation specialists (such as dispatchers and mechanics) as well as registering and inspecting aircraft. It is also responsible for the safety certification and continuous safety oversight of most forms of commercial operations. These responsibilities are carried out by 6 regions, Atlantic, Quebec, Ontario, Prairie & Northern, Pacific and the sixth region based in Ottawa (National Capital Region) is responsible for air operators operating international flights and certain types of large aeroplanes.  The Canadian Aviation Regulations (CARs) are also under Transport Canada control.\n\nThe Canadian Air Transport Security Authority is a Crown corporation that reports to parliament through the Minister of Transport.  It is responsible for the protection of specific elements of the air transportation system \u2013 from passenger and baggage screening to screening airport workers. In spring 2017 CATSA and the Canada Border Services Agency began their roll-out \"as part of a broader effort to modernize and streamline clearance procedures at Canadian airports\" of the self-service border clearance kiosks programme, under which Canadian travellers are subject to facial recognition technology upon re-entry to the country. It was expected that as a cost-cutting measure the programme was to reduce the number of civilian interactions with civil servants.\n\nCivil Aviation Authority\n\nTransport Canada's Civil Aviation (TCCA) Directorate is Canada's civil aviation authority. It has existed since 1936, when civil aviation was transferred from the Civil Aviation Branch of the Department of National Defence.\n\nBased in Ottawa, the Directorate has regional offices across Canada in geographical regions:\n\n Pacific \u2013 British Columbia\n Prairie and Northern \u2013 Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Northwest Territories, Yukon\n Ontario\n Quebec\n Atlantic Region \u2013 Nova Scotia, PEI, Newfoundland and Labrador, New Brunswick\n\nAir accident investigation\nPrior to 1990, Transport Canada was responsible for aircraft incident investigation through:\n\n Aircraft Accident Investigation Branch (1960\u20131984)\n Canadian Aviation Safety Board (1984\u20131990)\n\nAfter 1990, the role was transferred over to Transportation Safety Board of Canada.\n\nSurveillance fleet\n de Havilland Canada Dash 7-150IR (in 1990  a single aircraft (C-GCFR) replaced two specially modified ice patrol Lockheed L-188 Electra's registered as CF-NAY and C-GNDZ (both ex-Northwest Orient Airlines) that were operated under contract (for Ice Reconnaissance) for the Canadian government by Nordair in the late 1970s and later by Canadian Airlines. A second Electra CF-NAZ was written off in 1977 after an accident). and CF-NAX was sold in 1977 by Nordair and now owned by Buffalo Airways as C-FIJX\n Bombardier Dash 8M-100 - for Fisheries and Oceans Canada and Canadian Coast Guard\n Cessna 550 Citation II\n Beechcraft King Air C90A\n\nRecent controversies\n\nTransport Canada has been the centre of a number of controversies in recent years. In September 2009, the CBC's Fifth Estate produced a report \"Riding on Risk\", which detailed alleged mismanagement and cover-ups in Transport Canada. The story was sparked by a lost memory stick which was found by a journalism student. The memory stick contained many documents showing efforts by security inspectors to enforce aviation security regulations, and the perceived failure of management to do so. The CBC report also detailed the alleged reprisals\u00a0\u2014 and fear of reprisals\u00a0\u2014 against whistleblowers and other employees.\n\nTransport Canada's move to Safety Management Systems (SMS) in its regulation of civil aviation has been criticised. Whistleblower Hugh Danford, a former inspector at Transport Canada, went on record criticizing this approach, indicating that it would increase risk to the flying public. Critics have warned that introducing SMS to the aviation sector is \"a recipe for disaster\". However, the aviation accident rate in Canada declined over a number of years to 2008.\n\nThe rail industry in Canada, which has had SMS since 2001 and is also regulated by Transport Canada, had shown a marked increase in accidents under this regulatory scheme to 2006.\n\nSeveral Transport Canada senior executives, including Assistant Deputy Minister, Safety and Security, Marc Gr\u00e9goire, were sued in 2008 for reprisals against another whistleblower, Ian Bron. who reported that the Marine Security framework was riddled with gaps.\n\nOn 23 December 2013, it was revealed that a Transport Canada inspector had been dismissed for falsifying departmental reports. The identity of the guilty party was not revealed, because of a concern for his or her privacy.\n\nThe Canadian Association of Journalists nominated Transport Canada for its Secrecy Award for a second time in 2008, indicating that a bill to amend the Aeronautics Act will cause \"a veil of secrecy [to] fall over all information reported by airlines about performance, safety violations, aviation safety problems and their resolution.\"\n\nIn September 2009, Transport Canada was alleged to have fraudulently charged expenses to the non-existent Mackenzie Valley Pipeline project. This story came to light after repeated efforts by access to information expert Ken Rubin, and repeated denials by the department that the incriminating documents existed or that any impropriety had occurred.\n\nTransport Canada was criticized in 2008 for its refusal to approve electrical cars manufactured in Canada.\n\nIn 2017, Transport Canada proposed regulations for drones that were widely criticized.\n\nAs a result of the Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crash and the Lion Air Flight 610 crash, which occurred five months prior to the Ethiopian crash, most airlines and countries began grounding the Boeing 737 MAX 8 (and in many cases all MAX variants) due to safety concerns, but Transport Canada declined to temporarily ground Boeing 737 Max 8 operating in Canada. However, on 13 March, Transport Canada reversed the decision and grounded all 737 MAX 8 and MAX 9 aircraft.\n\nSee also\n ecoAuto \u2013 Canadian government incentive program to purchase fuel-efficient vehicles.\n Pleasure Craft Operator Card \u2013 Mandatory Boater Education in Canada\n Canadian Air Carrier Protection Program\n Transportation Safety Board of Canada\n Canadian Transportation Agency\n Air Board (Canada)\n\nThe provinces and territories also have their own transportation departments, namely to deal with roads and vehicle licensing and regulations:\n\n British Columbia Ministry of Transportation\nMinistry of Highways and Infrastructure (Saskatchewan)\n Minister of Infrastructure and Transportation (Manitoba)\n Ministry of Transportation of Ontario\n Transports Qu\u00e9bec\n Department of Transportation (New Brunswick)\n Nova Scotia Department of Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal\n\nReferences\n\n \nFederal departments and agencies of Canada\nCanadian transport law\nCanada\nInvestment promotion agencies\nFunding bodies of Canada\nMinistries established in 1935\n1935 establishments in Canada", "machine_text": "Transport Canada is the primary regulatory body in Canada responsible for the development, implementation, and coordination of policies, regulations, and programs related to transportation.

He was born in Bavaria, Germany, and immigrated to the United States in 1938. He is best known for his large canvas paintings and highly detailed lithographs that were inspired by calligraphic writing. Wilke was deeply intrigued by the written language, and much of his work was derived from his abstract interpretation of the shapes, colors and meanings of writing that he found in all languages and forms, including the poetry and ancient engravings of Asia and the Middle East. He was an avid art collector, particularly of tribal art, and was the founding director of the University of Iowa Museum of Art.\n\nWilke studied art at Harvard on a Carnegie scholarship before being drafted into the US Army in 1942. In 1947, he completed his master's degree in Art at the University of Iowa. Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, Wilke was an art teacher and director at several universities and museums. He received the Guggenheim Fellowship twice (in 1959 and 1960), which he used to travel to work and study first in Munich and Rome, and later Kyoto, Japan where he lived in monastery and studied Japanese Zen calligraphy under the monks.\n\nWilke returned to the US in the 1960s. He lived in New York City at this time and worked as a professor at Rutgers University. This period defined Wilke as an artist, and it was during this time that he became connected to the great New York school of artists of the 1950s and 1960s. He maintained close relationships with many famed artist colleagues including Ad Reinhardt, Julius Bissier, George Rickey, Mark Rothko, Lyonel Feininger, Max Beckmann, Mark Tobey, Kenzo Okada, Robert Motherwell and David Smith.\n\nIn 1968, Wilke's reputation as an art collector earned him a position as founding director of the University of Iowa Art Museum. He served as museum director there until relocating to Hawaii in 1978.\n\nWilke had many solo exhibitions throughout the United States and internationally, and was awarded many honors, including an exhibition and award from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters.

He taught at various institutions, including the Art Students League and Columbia University. Wilke's style was influenced by European modernism, particularly the work of Wassily Kandinsky and Paul Klee. He developed a geometric abstraction that emphasized color and form over representation. He was also interested in printmaking, and experimented with a variety of techniques such as etching, lithography, and woodcutting. Wilke's work received critical acclaim in the United States, and he was included in several important exhibitions, including the Museum of Modern Art's \"New Acquisitions\" show in 1946. He was also awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1953. In addition to his artistic pursuits, Wilke was an active member of the artist community in New York City and was known for his generosity and mentorship of young artists.

He did not play much for Malm\u00f6 after the move.\n\nChelsea FC\nMarko agreed to join Chelsea in January 2008, to join as a first-year scholar in June of the same year, staying with his home-town club until the transfer, with semi-regular visits to Cobham. Early signs were that Marko would score goals, and plenty of them. His arrival at Chelsea proper was delayed by participation in the Under-16 Nordic Tournament. In four games, he scored seven goals to easily finish as top goalscorer. He then won the Golden Boot in the Cobham Cup, before his first season was beset by injuries \u2013 first a thigh problem, then a back issue, and damaged ankle ligaments ended his season early. He still managed five goals in eight starts, an indication of his ability. Coming back refreshed from a summer break ahead of 2009/10, year two was Marko's breakthrough campaign. He finished top of the club's junior goalscoring ranks, a tally which compared well with the country's leading youth goalscorers, and he was a crucial part of the team's success in the FA Youth Cup, scoring the equaliser in the second leg of the Final against Aston Villa. He missed the first seven months of the 2010-11 season, having undergone surgery to repair damaged ankle ligaments early in the campaign. His return came in early March 2011, in a reserve match away to Bolton Wanderers. Injuries have, however, continued to affect him throughout the year of 2011 and into 2012, and he departed at the end of his contract in June 2012.\n\nBrescia Calcio\nIn the summer of 2012, Mitrovi\u0107 joined the Italian Serie B club Brescia Calcio.\n\n2012-13 season\nHe made his professional debut for Brescia in a Coppa Italia match against Cremonese. On 25 August 2012, he made his Serie B debut coming of the bench, in a 1-0 loss against Crotone. He finished the season scoring two goals in 22 games coming off the bench.\n\n2013-14 season\nIn the first game of the 2013-14 season, Mitrovi\u0107 scored his first goal of the season in a Coppa Italia win against S.S. Teramo Calcio.\n\nInternational career\nMarko has represented Sweden at Under-16, Under-17, and Under-19 levels. He took part in Nordic Cup with Sweden where they finished as runners-up, being beaten by Norway. He is, however, also eligible to play for Serbia.\n\nStyle of play\nHe is tall, broad and strong, with good left foot shot and impressive skill levels. Mitrovi\u0107 plays an attacking role, most often playing as a striker but can also play as a winger, and is known for his finishing, pace, dribbling, positioning, strength and his aerial ability. Although left footed, he is also able to control and dribble the ball and finish well with his right foot. Mitrovi\u0107 is known for his pace, skill, control and dribbling ability, as well as his flair in beating players during one on one situations. Uniquely, his height, strength, jumping ability and heading technique have given him an edge in winning aerial challenges for balls, with the majority of his goals often being headers. He has often been compared to a young Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107.\n\nCareer statistics\n\nHonours\n\nClub\n\nChelsea FC\n Cobham Cup (1): 2008-09\n FA Youth Cup (1): 2009-10\n Premier Reserve League (1): 2010-11\n\nIndividual\n Cobham Cup Golden Boot (1): 2008-09\n\nReferences\n\n Profile at Brescia Calcio\n Profile at Chelsea F.C.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"School uniforms in South Korea\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Almost all South Korean secondary students wear a prescribed school uniform, gyobok (). The majority of elementary schools except some private elementary schools do not have uniforms; however, the uniform is strictly enforced from the start of middle school and up. A typical South Korean uniform usually consists of a shirt, blazer and tie, with skirts for girls and trousers for boys. More recently, the uniform is often worn by celebrities who target the younger, teen audience to sell entertainment products. The school uniform and school setting is frequently used as a venue for romance. As a result, the uniform has become something akin to an expression of fashion among students.\n\nHistory\nThe Encyclopedia of Korean Culture divides the history of school uniforms into six parts: the 1800s-1910, 1910\u20131945, 1945\u20131968, 1968\u20131982, 1982\u20131985, 1986-current. While the first instances of school uniforms were shown in schools established in the late Goryeo period, a general influence is attributed to Confucius students from the Joseon period.\n\nLate 19th and early 20th century\n\nThe first school uniform in South Korea is from the Ewha Girl's University, now known as Ewha Womans University. The uniform was designated in 1886. The uniform consisted of a red jeogori and skirt made of cotton. The hair was braided swept-back with a knot. Clothing designed as a veil was used as an outdoor uniform. A heavier version of the clothing was used during the winter. Since the tradition was to wear different colored uniforms, the same red-colored uniform became a matter of curiosity.\n\nThe first boys' school uniform in South Korea originates from the boys' school Paichai Hakdang established by Henry Appenzeller. The uniform was created in 1898. The uniform heavily resembled the Japanese school uniform, consisting of red color bands wrapped around the sleeves, pants, and hat. Some scholars argue that the tradition of Korean school uniforms began with this uniform. Hansung Middle School, which was established in 1904, used a black durumagi with a black belt and a hat with the words 'Hansung' for a uniform.\n\nIn 1907, the first 'Yangjang' uniform was created in the Sookmyung Women's University. The uniform consisted of a purple serge one-piece clothing with a pink bonnet and heels. The uniform had a strong impact on Korean culture.\n\n20th century\n\nAfter the Japan-Korea Treaty of 1910, the school uniforms were widely implemented. This movement was heavily influenced by Western missionaries and was centered around girls-only schools. In general, Jeogori was elongated while the skirt was shortened. The previously diverse colors in school uniforms became less and less diverse, with most uniforms becoming shades of black and white.  In the 1920s, most of the girl uniforms came to have the 'white top black bottom' policy. However, schools differentiated their uniforms from others by means such as wave patterns and skirt lengths. Because the skirts were getting shorter, schools implemented an official policy concerning the length of the skirt. However, the skirt lengths kept decreasing. Also in the 1920s, P.E. uniforms were introduced. There were many types of P.E. uniforms, but it mostly consisted of a shirt and bloomers.\n\nIn the 1930s, the Empire of Japan, which ruled over Korea, implemented a policy to unify the girls' uniforms as 'yangjang.' The change in policy is attributed to both a growing awareness of Western culture and a movement by Japan to get rid of hanbok. The most widespread school uniform for girls was a white blouse with a brown skirt, and a sailor suit uniform in the winter. However, a few schools still maintained the hanbok uniform.\n\nIn the late 1930s to the 1940s, students were forced to wear workwear. This was due to the beginning of World War II and Japan's involvement in the war. The uniform was dubbed 'Mum-Bae (\ubab8\ube7c).' Some schools avoided this policy by designating other pants as uniforms. Other schools such as ChungShim Women's School refused to comply with the policy and wore hanbok.\n\nWith the completion of the Korean independence movement and the independence of Korea, the workwear uniform was discarded. Until the 1960s, uniform pants were still worn as the official uniform. The uniforms were generally black or dark brown.\n\nIn 1968, the government established the 'Middle School Equalization Policy.' The Middle School uniforms were standardized at this time. The summer uniform was established as a white 'Wing-collar' blouse and the winter uniform as black or dark brown clothing. This policy was maintained until 1982.\n\nFrom 1983 to 1985, school uniforms were briefly abolished due to a 'free school uniform policy.' The policy was established to diminish the senses of oppression and alienation while encouraging individualism. This policy was removed in 1986 when schools were allowed to mandate uniforms again. Since then, the number of schools mandating uniforms had been increasing.\n\nCurrent\n\nSchools are currently not compelled to institute school uniforms. However, according to the Ministry of Education (South Korea), 96.4% of female students are wearing uniforms. To combat temperature, sexual harassment, and traditional sexual discrimination, the Ministry of Education (South Korea) has been encouraging the usage of pants as school uniforms, as of 2000.\n\nComponents\nA typical Korean school uniform for a boy usually includes a jacket, a long-sleeved collared white shirt, a tie, dress trousers, and outerwear for the Winter season. A girl's Korean school uniform generally consists of a bow, a collared white shirt with sleeves, a vest, a pleated skirt and outerwear for the winter, and white socks. Nail polish and make-up were generally not allowed until many municipal education departments enacted 'Student's rights acts' which include freedom of uniform and freedom of hair style.\n\nSee also\n\nSchool uniforms\nSouth Korea\n\nReferences\n\nEducation in South Korea\nSchool uniform", "machine_text": "School uniforms in South Korea are mandatory for students in public schools and many private schools. The uniform policy is a tradition of the country and has been implemented for more than a century. The standard uniform consists of a white shirt/blouse, a black skirt/pants, and a bow tie or ribbon with school colors. The uniform policy has several benefits. Firstly, it is believed to portray a sense of discipline and order among students, making it easier for teachers to establish a classroom environment conducive for learning. Secondly, it eliminates the issue of social class discrimination, where students from different backgrounds may feel ostracized based on their clothes. Lastly, it instills a sense of pride and unity among students, as they identify themselves as part of a particular school community. Apart from the standard uniform, schools may also have different uniforms for different seasons or occasions. For example, in the winter months, students may wear thicker materials, such as sweaters and jackets, or may have scarves and gloves in school colors. Some schools may also have sports uniforms or uniforms for special events, such as school trips or ceremonies. The cost of school uniforms may vary according to the school and the type of uniform required. Some schools may provide the basic uniform free of charge, while others may require students to purchase them. Additionally, there may be fees associated with different pieces of the uniform, such as blazers or ties. There have been criticisms of the uniform policy, with some arguing that it restricts individuality and self-expression among students. However, supporters of the policy believe that there are still ways for students to express themselves within the boundaries of the policy, such as through hair accessories or different shoe styles. In conclusion, school uniforms in South Korea have been a long-standing tradition and continue to be a mandatory policy in many schools. While there may be differing opinions on the benefits and limitations of the policy, it remains an important aspect of the country's education system.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 33576830}

Menken is best known for his scores and songs for films produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios. His scores and songs for The Little Mermaid (1989), Beauty and the Beast (1991), Aladdin (1992), and Pocahontas (1995) have each won him two Academy Awards.

His accolades include eight Academy Awards, a Tony Award, eleven Grammy Awards, seven Golden Globe Awards, and a Daytime Emmy Award.\n\nHe is also known for his work in musical theater for Broadway and elsewhere. Some of these are based on his Disney films, but other stage hits include Little Shop of Horrors (1982), A Christmas Carol (1994), and Sister Act (2009).\n\nMenken has collaborated with such lyricists as Lynn Ahrens, Howard Ashman, Jack Feldman, Tim Rice, Glenn Slater, Stephen Schwartz, and David Zippel. With eight Academy Award wins, Menken is the second most prolific Oscar winner in the music categories after Alfred Newman, who has 9 Oscars. He has also won 11 Grammy Awards, a Tony Award, and a Daytime Emmy Award among many other honors. Menken is one of sixteen people to have won an Oscar, an Emmy, a Grammy, and a Tony.\n\nEarly life \nAlan Irwin Menken was born on July 22, 1949, at French Hospital in Manhattan, to Judith and Norman Menken. His father was a boogie-woogie piano-playing dentist, and his mother was an actress, dancer and playwright. His family was Jewish. Menken developed an interest in music at an early age, taking piano and violin lessons. He began to compose at an early age. At age nine, at the New York Federation of Music Clubs Junior Composers Contest, his original composition \"Bouree\" was rated Superior and Excellent by the judges.\n\nHe attended New Rochelle High School in New Rochelle, New York, and graduated in 1967. Menken remembers: \"I'd make up my own Bach fugues and Beethoven sonatas because I was bored with the piano and I didn't want to practice; so I'd go off on tangents\". He then enrolled at New York University. He graduated with a degree in Musicology in 1971 from the university's Steinhardt School.  Menken recalled: \"First, I was pre-med. I thought I'd be a dentist like my dad. Finally, I got a degree in music, but I didn't care about musicology. It wasn't until I joined BMI Workshop ... under Lehman Engel, and walked into a room with other composers that I knew this was it.\" Menken noted that \"Before college, I was writing songs to further my dream of being the next Bob Dylan. A lot of guitar songs \u2013 I was composing on piano before that.\" After college, he attended the BMI Lehman Engel Musical Theatre Workshop.\n\nCareer\n\nEarly career \nAfter graduating, Menken's plan was to become either a rock star or a recording artist. His interest in writing musicals increased when he joined the Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI) Musical Theatre Workshop and was mentored by Lehman Engel. From 1974 to 1978, he showcased various BMI workshop works, such as Midnight, Apartment House (lyric by Muriel Robinson), Conversations with Pierre, Harry the Rat and Messiah on Mott Street (lyrics by David Zippel).\n\nAccording to Menken, during this period, he \"worked as a ballet and modern dance accompanist, a musical director for club acts, a jingle writer, arranger, a songwriter for Sesame Street and a vocal coach\". He performed his material at clubs like The Ballroom, Reno Sweeny and Tramps.\n\nIn 1976, John Wilson reported for The New York Times that members of Engel's BMI Workshop began performing as part of the \"Broadway at the Ballroom\" series: \"The opening workshop program ... featured Maury Yeston and Alan Menken, both playing their piano accompaniment and singing songs they have written for potential musicals.\" Wilson reviewed a performance at the Ballroom in 1977 where Menken accompanied a singer: \"In the current cabaret world, a piano accompanist is no longer expected to merely play piano for a singer. More and more, pianists can be heard joining in vocally, harmonizing with the singer, creating a background of shouts and exclamations or even doing brief passages of solo singing.\"\n\nMenken contributed material to revues like New York's Back in Town, Big Apple Country, The Present Tense (1977), Real Life Funnies (Off-Broadway, 1981), Diamonds (Off-Broadway, 1984), and Personals (Off-Off-Broadway, 1985). His revue Patch, Patch, Patch ran at the West Bank Cafe in New York City in 1979 and featured Chip Zien. The New York Times reviewer Mel Gussow wrote: \"The title song ... refers to a life's passage. According to Alan Menken ... after age 30 it is a downhill plunge.\"\n\nMenken wrote several shows that were not produced, including Atina, Evil Queen of the Galaxy (1980), with lyrics by Steve Brown. He also wrote The Thorn with lyrics by Brown, which was commissioned by Divine in 1980. This was a parody of the film The Rose, but they could not raise the money to have it produced. He collaborated with Howard Ashman in an uncompleted musical called Babe (c. 1981), with Tom Eyen in Kicks: The Showgirl Musical (1984), and with David Rogers in The Dream in Royal Street (c. 1981), which was an adaptation of A Midsummer Night's Dream. Menken contributed music for the film The Line (1980), directed by Robert J. Siegel.\n\nBreakthrough years \nMenken finally achieved success as a composer when playwright Howard Ashman chose him and Engel to write the music for his musical adaptation of Kurt Vonnegut's novel God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater. The musical opened in 1979 at the WPA Theater to excellent reviews and modest box office. It transferred after several months to the Off-Broadway Entermedia Theater, where it ran for an additional six weeks.\n\nMenken and Ashman wrote their next musical, Little Shop of Horrors, for a cast of only 9 performers, including a puppeteer. This musical is based on the 1960 black comedy film The Little Shop of Horrors. It opened at WPA Theater in 1982 to warm reviews. It moved to the Off Broadway Orpheum Theatre in the East Village, Manhattan, where it ran for five years. The musical set the box-office record for highest grossing Off-Broadway show of all time. It toured around the world, won theater awards and was adapted as a 1986 musical film starring Rick Moranis that earned Menken and Ashman their first Oscar nomination for the song \"Mean Green Mother From Outer Space\". For his body of work in musical theatre, he was awarded the BMI Career Achievement Award in 1983.\n\nIn 1987, Menken and lyricist David Spencer's adaptation The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz, based on the 1959 novel of the same name, was produced in Philadelphia. After substantial re-writes, it was produced in 2015 in Montreal. In 1992, the WPA Theatre produced Menken's Weird Romance, also with lyrics by Spencer. Menken's musical based on the Charles Dickens novella A Christmas Carol, with lyrics by Lynn Ahrens and book by Mike Ockrent, debuted at Madison Square Garden's Paramount Theater in 1994. The show proved successful and was an annual New York holiday event.\n\nDisney Renaissance and later films \nOn the strength of the success of Little Shop of Horrors, Menken and Ashman were hired by Walt Disney Studios to write the music for The Little Mermaid (1989). The challenge was to create an animated musical film of this Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale that could sit alongside the Disney films Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Cinderella. The Little Mermaid opened to critical and commercial success and signaled a new Disney era called the Disney Renaissance. The film gave them their first Oscar win: Best Song for the song \"Under the Sea\". Menken also won the 1989 Oscar for Best Score.\n\nMenken and Ashman's Beauty and the Beast garnered them three 1991 Oscar nominations for Best Song, winning for its title song. Menken won another Oscar for Best Score. The two were working on Aladdin at the time of Ashman's death in 1991. Ashman wrote only three songs in the film and Menken collaborated with Tim Rice, who was then working The Lion King, to write the rest of the songs for the film. The film won an Oscar in 1992 for Best Song: \"A Whole New World\". Menken also won the Oscar for Best Score. Menken's live action musical film Newsies, with lyrics by Jack Feldman, was released in 1992.\n\nThree more animated musical films followed. Menken collaborated with Stephen Schwartz for Pocahontas, for which the two won two Oscars: Best Song and Best Musical or Comedy Score. In 1996, the same musical team created the songs, and Menken, the score, for The Hunchback of Notre Dame. In 1997, Menken reunited with his early collaborator, David Zippel, for his last film in the era, Hercules.\n\nMenken also wrote the music for the Michael J. Fox vehicle Life with Mikey (1993), the holiday film Noel (2004) and Mirror Mirror (2012). His other film scores for Disney have included Home on the Range (2004), the Tim Allen remake of The Shaggy Dog (2006), Enchanted (2007), and Tangled (2010).\n\nIn March 2017, Disney released a live-action adaptation of Beauty and the Beast, directed by Bill Condon, with the songs from the 1991 film and new material by Menken and Rice. Menken collaborated with Benj Pasek and Justin Paul on writing new songs for the 2019 live-action version of Aladdin, directed by Guy Ritchie.\n\nMenken is also working on new music for a live-action film adaptation of The Little Mermaid, directed by Rob Marshall, with longtime The Little Mermaid fan Lin-Manuel Miranda, whom Menken knew since the former's childhood, as Miranda went to the same school as Menken's niece. Menken will also once again be working with Stephen Schwartz to write new songs for Disenchanted, the sequel to Enchanted, and for a remake of The Hunchback of Notre Dame, which Menken will score. Menken is also working alongside former Disney chief creative officer John Lasseter on a project at Skydance Animation. On May 20 2020, the project was revealed to be Vicky Jenson's Spellbound. Menken will co-write songs for Spellbound alongside Glenn Slater, with whom he worked in Home on the Range and Tangled. Menken is also reportedly attached to a sequel to Aladdin.\n\nWith eight Academy Awards, only composer Alfred Newman (nine wins) and Walt Disney (22 wins) have received more Oscars than Menken. He is tied for third place with late costume designer Edith Head, and currently holds the record for the most wins for a living person.\n\nReturn to musical theatre \nMenken debuted on Broadway with a musical theatre adaptation of Beauty and the Beast that opened in 1994 and ran for 13 years before closing in 2007. In 1997, he collaborated with lyricist Tim Rice on a musical, King David, based on the biblical character, which was performed in a concert version on Broadway at the New Amsterdam Theatre. Little Shop of Horrors played on Broadway from 2003 to 2004.\n\nHe next created the stage version of The Little Mermaid, which played on Broadway from 2008 to 2009 and for which he received a nomination for a Tony Award for Best Score. Menken's stage adaptation of Sister Act premiered in London in 2009, and opened on Broadway in 2011. He was nominated for another Tony Award for Best Score. Menken received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2010. In December 2010, he was a guest on the NPR quiz show Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!.\n\nIn 2012, Menken won a Tony Award for Best Score for his musical adaptation of Newsies, which ran until 2014. He also wrote the music for Leap of Faith, which had a brief run on Broadway in 2012. His stage adaptation of Aladdin opened on Broadway in 2014, earning him another Tony nomination for Best Score. In 2013, he was a guest at the annual Junior Theatre Festival in Atlanta, Georgia, and was honored with the Junior Theater Festival  Award. He gave a concert there, including music that was cut from various productions, while talking about his creative process.\n\nMenken's stage adaptation of The Hunchback of Notre Dame played at La Jolla Playhouse, California, in 2014. The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz was revived in Montreal in 2015, and A Bronx Tale: The Musical played at the Paper Mill Playhouse in 2016. Menken is currently working on stage musical adaptations of Night at the Museum and Animal Farm.\n\nAs of 2019, Menken is reuniting with his Newsies creators Jack Feldman and Harvey Fierstein to develop a new musical called Greetings from Niagara Falls. A reading was held in January 2019; however, there is no word on future plans for the project at this time.\n\nTelevision work \nFrom 1989 to 1990, Menken and Howard Ashman wrote songs for the popular puppet TV show Sesame Street. In 2008, Menken said that his work on Sesame Street was \"pathetic money, but it still had some prestige to it. It was on the air and [he] was getting some royalties\". The duo also wrote a song titled \"Wonderful Ways to Say No\" for the 1990 animated anti-drug special Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue.\n\nIn 2015, Menken co-composed the score for the musical television series Galavant alongside Christopher Lennertz, reuninting him with Tangled screenwriter Dan Fogelman. Menken also co-wrote songs for the series alongside Glenn Slater. The series lasted two seasons, first airing on January 4, 2015, and last airing on January 31, 2016. In 2017, Menken and Slater returned to write songs for the animated series Rapunzel's Tangled Adventure, which is set after the events of Tangled. The series ended in 2020, after three seasons. On July 26, 2020, Menken and Slater won the Daytime Emmy Award for Original Song in a Children's, Young Adult or Animated Program for the song titled \"Waiting in the Wings\".\n\nMenken is currently writing songs for a prequel/spin-off series to 2017's Beauty and the Beast titled Little Town, which will be centered on Gaston and LeFou. The series will be released on Disney's streaming service, Disney+. Menken will also be an executive-producer on the series.\n\nPersonal life\nMenken was introduced to ballet dancer Janis Roswick while working with the Downtown Ballet Company. They have been married since November 1972 and live in North Salem, New York.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Jisha murder case\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Jisha murder case was a rape and murder crime that shook the Indian state of Kerala during April 2016 and it went on to become the most publicized crime case during the Kerala Legislative elections in May 2016.\n\nVictim background\nJisha, a 29-year-old law student at the Government Law College, Ernakulam, was found murdered on 28 April 2016 at her home near a canal in Perumbavoor in Ernakulam. She was found dead at her house on 28 April 8.30 pm by her mother Rajeswari. Jisha was a Hindu woman belonging to the scheduled caste. She was living with her mother, who works as a casual labourer. Her father, Pappu, who had separated from the family, lived alone and was found dead on 9 November 2017 due to natural causes. Police were puzzled in the initial stages of the investigation, due to the mother's paranoia and the family's lack of relationships with neighbors or relatives. This affected the case's progress initially, among other factors.\n\nMurder\nThe police found the body mutilated and disturbingly sliced. Forensics concluded the body injuries showed violence, possible torture and presence of alcohol. The report also noted that the culprit had used a sharp weapon to disembowel her. Jisha was stabbed over 30 times. Her chest was pierced with a dagger. The postmortem conducted at Alappuzha Medical college states that, severe infliction on the neck led to her death.\nAccording to forensic officials, samples of blood and saliva recovered have been sent for examination, and DNA is recorded for matching.  Upon preliminary investigation, the police revealed that Jisha would have been murdered when she resisted the rape attempt. The investigators also probed into migrant workers in the area for any clue on the murder.\n\nCase impact\nThe crime took place in the backdrop of the Kerala Legislative elections, and hence gained momentum and focus from political parties. As a woman brutally murdered in her home in Perumbavoor, Justice for Jisha was the hashtag (#JusticeForJisha) used in the social media during April 2016 to quicken efforts for justice to Jisha by politicians and largely by people. The film industry also joined forces in demanding justice for Jisha. The government has declared to offer a financial consolation of Rs 10 lakh to the family of Jisha and a home will be provided for her parents. Also many artists and humanitarians pledged support to the case.\n\nArrest of murderer\nThrough continuous search of the police and involvement of people, the Jisha murder case came through a breakthrough. A man hailing from Assam informed his doubts about a worker he knew to the Kerala police; following the lead they picked up the Assamese labourer, and learnt that 24-year-old Ameer-ul-Islam was the culprit and was arrested from Kancheepuram in Tamil Nadu. He admitted committing the gruesome murder of the woman in Perumbavoor. Police found that the crime was motivated by previous grudge and revenge and committed under the influence of alcohol. The alcoholic assailant observed Jisha's routine and waited to sexually assault her; in that effort and rage he killed her and when she asked for water moments before death he gave her alcohol that he had with him. DNA tests conducted, matched and the police also recovered the knife used by the perpetrator. Police also suspect Anarul Islam's involvement, a friend of Ameerul Islam who fled after the murder news. He allegedly escaped from Assam before the arrest.\n\nSentencing and aftermath\nAdvocate Biju Antony Aloor (popularly known as Advocate B A Aloor) appeared in the court as the defence lawyer for the accused Ameer ul Islam in the Jisha murder case. Advocate Biju Antony Aloor (popularly known as Advocate B A Aloor) hails from Aloor, a place in the Thrissur district in the Kerala state of India. He has also appeared in the court as the defence lawyer for Govindachamy, the man who was accused of murdering a woman traveling in a train in 2011 in Thrissur.For premeditated murders, rape, and the use of disabling violent force, the verdict is usually life imprisonment or death sentence.\n\nThe case also has motivated the government to structure a policy to halt differentiating people overly as men and women, which creates stereotyped societal divide and asked media to regulate depictions of gender-negative stereotypes to cultivate gender equity, lessen the crimes as a long-term plan to a certain extent and to regulate yellow journalism in forms of discussions and unnecessary probings through media, primarily to minimize the impact of trauma. This case also made the government to actively saddle on the implementation of alcohol prohibition in a phased manner. The Ernakulam principal district and sessions court, in December 2017, awarded death penalty to Ameer ul-Islam, the sole accused in the case. He was also awarded life term, and rigorous imprisonment of 10 and 7 years.\n\nReferences\n\n2016 crimes in India\nRape in India\nStalking\nMay 2016 crimes in Asia\nMurder in India\n2016 murders in Asia\n2010s murders in India\nDeaths by stabbing in India", "machine_text": "The Jisha murder case was a high-profile murder case that took place in the Indian state of Kerala in April 2016. Jisha, a 30-year-old law student, was found murdered in her home in Perumbavoor, Kerala. The brutal nature of the murder shocked the entire state and led to widespread protests and demands for justice. The investigation into the murder was conducted by the Kerala police and lasted for over a year. The police arrested a migrant worker, Ameerul Islam, in May 2016 in connection with the murder. Islam was charged with rape, murder, and destruction of evidence. The case drew significant media attention, particularly from women's rights groups, who highlighted the issue of violence against women in India. The case also sparked a debate on the issue of safety for women in the country, with many calling for stronger measures to protect women from violence. The trial of Ameerul Islam began in April 2017 and lasted for over a year. The prosecution presented evidence, including DNA samples and witnesses, to prove that Islam was responsible for the murder. In December 2017, the court found Islam guilty of the charges and sentenced him to death. The verdict was welcomed by women's rights groups and the general public, who applauded the police and the judiciary for their efforts in bringing the perpetrator to justice. The case has also led to a renewed focus on the need for better safety measures for women in India and has sparked a national conversation on the issue of violence against women. In conclusion, the Jisha murder case is a tragic but important landmark in the fight against violence against women in India. It has highlighted the urgent need for better safety measures for women and has helped to create greater awareness of the issue across the country.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 50480156}

She was a member of the United States national team from 1997 to 2000, and competed on the University of California, Los Angeles intercollegiate gymnastics team from 2001 to 2003. She was an alternate for the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games.\n\nGymnastics career\n\nPre-elite \nBeckerman began training in gymnastics in 1986, when she was five years old.\n\nElite career \nIn 1996, Beckerman placed twenty-fifth in the all-around junior division at the Coca-Cola National Championships. In 1997, Beckerman became a senior competitor and a member of the United States national team. She competed at the 1997 US Classic and placed ninth in the all-around. She also competed at the 1997 John Hancock US Gymnastics Championships, placing twentieth in the all-around.\n\nIn 1998, Beckerman moved from New Jersey to Ohio to train with coach Mary Lee Tracy at Cincinnati Gymnastics Academy. Tracy trained Beckerman for up to ten hours per day, and kept Beckerman on a restrictive diet of under 1100 calories per day. According to Beckerman, Tracy \"controlled every element, in and out of the gym\" creating a competitive culture of anxiety and silence.\n\nBeckerman was a silver medalist on bars at the 1998 US National Championships and placed second in the all-around at the 1998 Ecoair Gymnastics Cup. Beckerman was third on bars and fourth in the all-around at the 1999 US National Championships. She was third in the all around at the 1999 American Classic and a team silver medalist at the 1999 Pan American Games. She took third in the all-around at the 1999 World Championships trials and was named to the 1999 US World Championships team but was unable to compete due to a broken wrist.  Beckerman won the all-around and team competition at the 2000 Spieth Sogipa. She was first on balance beam, second on bars and fifth in the all-around at the 2000 US National Championships. She was named an alternate member of the 2000 US Olympic team, but did not compete because fellow alternate Tasha Schwikert was selected instead to replace injured team member Morgan White.\n\nBy the end of Beckerman's elite career, she had suffered nine broken bones, undergone two surgeries, and developed bleeding ulcers from overuse of anti-inflammatory drugs. During her career, she also suffered from disordered eating. During her elite career, her favorite event was uneven bars.\n\nIntercollegiate career \nBeckerman competed on the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) intercollegiate gymnastics team from 2001 to 2003 while pursuing a degree in sociology.  In 2001, Beckerman was limited to three competitions due to a wrist injury. She placed second and recorded a score of 9.875 on balance beam at Arizona State, as well as placing fifth on balance beam with a score of 9.8 at the UCLA Invitational. She earned NACGC Scholastic All-America honors that year. During the 2002 season, Beckerman was UCLA's anchor on balance beam, averaging 9.77 over the year and winning individually six times.  She was NCAA South Central Regional balance beam champion and Pac-10 balance beam champion, as well as earning a Pac-10 All-Academic honorable mention. On September 11, 2003, at the beginning of her senior year, Beckerman was dismissed from the UCLA team by coach Valorie Kondos Field. Kondos Field claimed that the dismissal was due to Beckerman's performance in training and unenthusiastic attitude, although Beckerman disputed those allegations. Beckerman was stripped of her athletic scholarship and housing, but completed her degree. In 2020, following widespread public discussion on social media under the hashtag \"#gymnastalliance\" of allegations by gymnasts of an abusive gymnastics culture that rewarded coaches who damaged and belittled gymnasts, Beckerman posted an open letter to Ms Kondos Field on social media where she related her experiences of competing at UCLA.\n\nPost-gymnastics career \nAs of 2018, Beckerman owns a music school and works as an emergency medical technician in New Jersey. In a 2018 interview after the USA gymnastics abuse scandal became public, Beckerman expressed that she was \"leaning toward\" favoring the dissolution of USA Gymnastics because \"the structure needs to be changed completely so obedience isn't the desired outcome.\" She said:\"When [a coach] has so much control, it puts a young person in a mindset that the coach has more authority than anyone else in their life - that they should put all their faith in them...There's a fine line between...where the culture is healthy, to a culture of silence...[In elite gymnastics, gymnasts] were not allowed to speak...That does a lot to you, psychologically. You try to be as meek and as serious as possible. 'Stoic' was this huge compliment at [national training] camp. We all strived for that. Being someone who never complained was a compliment. So, you don't speak out, because it's ingrained in you that if you do, you have poor integrity, that you're a bad gymnast, a bad teammate. Asking questions [in elite gymnastics] is very taboo.\"\n\nPersonal life \nBeckerman was born in Long Branch, New Jersey to Howard and Melanie Beckerman. She has two brothers and is the middle sibling. Beckerman grew up in Middletown Township, New Jersey, where she attended Middletown High School South. In 2014, she married Matthew King.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nBeckerman gymnastic biography\nUCLA Player bio\n\n1981 births\nLiving people\nAmerican female artistic gymnasts\nJewish American sportspeople\nJewish gymnasts\nMiddletown High School South alumni\nUCLA Bruins women's gymnasts\nSportspeople from Long Branch, New Jersey\nPeople from Middletown Township, New Jersey\nPeople from Wyoming, Ohio\nSportspeople from the Cincinnati metropolitan area\nSportspeople from the New York metropolitan area\nPan American Games medalists in gymnastics\nPan American Games silver medalists for the United States\nU.S. women's national team gymnasts\nGymnasts at the 1999 Pan American Games\n21st-century American Jews\n21st-century American women", "machine_text": "Alyssa Beckerman is a retired American artistic gymnast who competed in the 1992 Summer Olympics and the 1991 and 1992 World Championships.

This perception was probably also due to Khan Tengri's visibility across the plains of southern Kazakhstan while Jengish Chokusu remains out of view of civilization. Khan Tengri is the highest peak in the rugged Tengri Tag subrange, also known as the Mustag, that also contains Chapaev Peak () and Gorky Peak (). Anatoli Boukreev considered Khan Tengri perhaps the world's most beautiful peak because of its geometric ridges and its symmetry.\n\nHistory\nAlthough it is almost 430 m (1,500\u00a0ft) lower than its neighbor, Khan Tengri was believed to be the highest peak in the range until Jengish Chokusu was surveyed in 1943 and determined to be higher.\n\nPeter Semenov was the first European to see the Tengri Tag and its peak, the colossal Khan Tengri (in 1857).\n\nThe first ascent of the peak was made in 1931 by \u2019s Ukrainian team through a route from the south (Kyrgyzstan side), then along the west ridge. M. Kuzmin's team made the first ascent from the north (Kazakhstan side) in 1964. Khan Tengri is one of five peaks that a Soviet mountaineer needed to scale to earn the prestigious Snow Leopard award.\n\nAnatoli Boukreev achieved the first solo speed ascent in 1990.\n\nA team from Kazakhstan made the first winter ascent of Khan Tengri on February 7, 1992; the team included Valery Khrichtchatyi, Viktor Dedi, Yuri Moiseyev, Valdimir Suviga, Aleksandr Savin, Igor Putintsev and Malik Ismetov.\n\nAustrian mountaineer and expedition leader Toni D\u00fcrnberger died while descending after having climbed Khan Tengri on 17 August 1992.\n\nIn 2004, more than a dozen mountaineers were killed in a large avalanche on the Pogrebetsky route, the most popular route on the mountain.\n\nThe peak appears on the Kyrgyz 100 som bill.\n\nSee also \n\n List of elevation extremes by country\n\nFootnotes\n\nExternal links\n \n \n Khan Tengri route maps\n International Mountaineering Camp Kan Tengri\n\nMountains of China\nMountains of Kazakhstan\nMountains of Kyrgyzstan\nIssyk-Kul Region\nLandforms of Almaty Region\nKazakhstan\u2013Kyrgyzstan border\nInternational mountains of Asia\nSeven-thousanders of the Tian Shan\nChina\u2013Kazakhstan border\nChina\u2013Kyrgyzstan border\nBorder tripoints\nHighest points of countries\nTengriism", "machine_text": "Khan Tengri is a mountain peak located in the Central Asian region of the Tian Shan mountain range.

Khan Tengri is located on the Kyrgyzstan-Kazakhstan border, with its northern face lying in Kazakhstan and its southern face in Kyrgyzstan. The mountain is known for its striking beauty, with its sharp peak rising above vast snowfields and glaciers. It is also known for its challenging climbing routes, with the first successful ascent of the peak not taking place until 1931 by a Soviet team led by M. Pogrebetsky. Khan Tengri is considered one of the most beautiful and challenging peaks in the world, attracting many mountaineers every year. The peak presents a variety of climbing challenges, including steep ridges, icefalls, and a large ice cap that covers its highest slopes. The peak is climbed from the north side in Kazakhstan and from the south side in Kyrgyzstan. The peak has been the subject of various cultural and mythological interpretations by local people. It was traditionally seen as a sacred site by the Kazakhs and the Kyrgyz, who believed it was the dwelling place of spirits and deities. The peak has also been the subject of many legends and tales in Central Asian folklore, with some stories claiming that its summit was the gateway to the heavens. Today, Khan Tengri is a popular destination for adventure travelers and mountaineers from all over the world. The peak is protected under the banner of the Khan Tengri National Park, which was established in 1997 to conserve the unique natural and cultural values of the area.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Quimbanda\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Quimbanda () is an Afro-Brazilian religion practiced primarily in the urban city centers of Brazil. Quimbanda practices are typically associated with magic, rituals with Exus, and Pombagiras spirits. Quimbanda was originally contained under the religious tradition of Macumba. In the early years of the 21st century some began to assert that Quimbanda was totally separate from Umbanda. Umbanda represented the more Europeanized traits of the religion. Quimbanda has continued to insist that it is a distinct religion, while rejecting Catholic and Kardecist Spiritist influences that have penetrated Umbanda and other Afro-Brazilian religions.\n\nSpirits\n\nExus \n\nIn Quimbanda the male spirits are known as Exus, they are considered very powerful spirits. Note that they are not the same as the Eshu/ Elegua of Lukumi Elegua/ Santeria; as Quimbanda has evolved as a religion, it has created a category of spirits collectively called Exus, whose name was borrowed from the deity Exu. Exus refers to the phalanx of spirits. Religious professor Kelly E. Hayes outlines the purposes of Exu spirits:\n \"[Quimbanda] is associated particularly with the cultivation of a set of powerful spirit entities called Exus, referred to by their devotees as guardians.\nExus, commonly referred to as \u2018spirits of the left\u2019, are not purely evil. Instead, they are more human-like in their qualities and share in human weaknesses. Exu spirits primarily deal with human and material matters as opposed to the \u2018spirits of the right\u2019 used in Umbanda, who deal with primarily spiritual matters. Exus are typically called for rituals to arrange rendezvous, force justice, or keep life balance. From inside of the cult, Quimbanderos instead affirm that Exus cover both Spirit and Matter, and that They simply consider pointless to stick only to one of them. According to the lore provided by trained sorcerers, Exus has a stern and high morality, They simply accept to help people into delicate matters too, like seduction and vengeance, but never with the uninterest in morality and ethic often attributed to them by outsiders.\n\nPomba Giras \n\nAnother set of deities associated with Quimbanda are not directly derived from the Yoruba religious tradition: Pomba Giras, the female counterparts of Exus. Prominent Pomba Giras such as Pomba Gira Maria Mulambo, also known as \u2018Maria of the trash\u2019, are used for specific rituals often relating to their names.  refers to someone who is wearing ragged clothing or someone who is very unlucky. Therefore, Pomba Gira Maria Mulambo is summoned to overturn or destroy someone and make them a . A legend about Maria Mulambo says that she drew her title from the fact that she gave up her richness as a princess, so to marry her non-rich lover, and join him to help the poor, before her angry husband had her murdered; because of this, it is not a good idea to ask her to attack somebody without a good reason, for Pomba Giras have devious ways, but a firm (yet crooked to outsiders) morality.\n\nOgum \n\nOgum is the orisha of warfare and metal. Ogum is also known as the Lord at the center of the crossroads. Rituals involving Ogum are typically less aggressive and more justice-bound than that of Exu. Professor David J. Hess speculates that Ogum acts as an intermediate figure between the rituals of Exu in Quimbanda and the rituals of Umbanda, revealing the deep connection between Quimbanda and Umbanda.\n\nPractices\n\nRituals \nA classic Quimbanda ritual, called a , consists of several parts: a motive, dedication to a spirit, a marginal location, the metal or clay (earthy) material, an alcoholic drink, scent, and food (usually a peppered flour-palm oil mixture, sometimes called ). An example of a  is as follows:\n Trabalho 1: \" A work of great force, under the protection of [Exu] Tranca Ruas das Almas (Block-Streets-of-the-Souls), to eliminate an enemy. \" 1) Go to a crossroads of Exu on a Monday or Friday near midnight, if possible in the company of a member of the opposite sex; 2) greet Ogum with a bottle of light beer, a white or red candle, and a lighted cigar; 3) greet Exu Sir Block-Streets-of-the-Souls by opening seven bottles of rum () in the form of a circle, lighting seven red and black candles, and offering seven cigars; 4) put inside a vase () and mix the following: manioc flour (), palm oil (), and peppers; 5) put on the ground in the center of the circle the name of the person whom one wishes to hurt, and, using a knife, stab this with violence, asking Exu to attend to one's request.\"\n\nDepending on the purpose of the ritual, aspects of the trabalho will change. For instance, if one desires to seek justice from Exu they will use white candles, rum and a written request. Therefore, certain colors denote different motives in a ritual: white symbolizing an honest and justice-bound motive and red and black representing an aggressive and illicit motive. Other rituals substitute the harsh or spicy smell of cigars for the sweet smell of carnations, thus symbolizing the transformation between harming and helping rituals. Likewise, rituals involving female spirits (Pomba Giras) are less aggressive in their performance. A  to obtain a woman is as follows:\nTrabalho 7: \"to obtain a woman. \" 1) On a Monday or Friday night, go to a female crossroads (T-shaped rather than plus-shaped) and greet Pomba Gira by pouring a little rum, or better yet, champagne or anisette (); 2) place two pieces of cloth () on the ground, one red and the other black, and on top of this put five or seven red roses in the shape of a horseshoe; 3) fill a cup of good quality with champagne or anisette; 4) put the name of the desired person in the cup or in the center of the horseshoe; 5) sing a  (song) and thank Pomba Gira.\"\n\nParticular elements of an Exu trabalho remain unchanged in the Pomba Gira  and therefore mark Pomba Giras as the female counterparts of Exu: the colors, the location (male to female variation), the time of day, the day of the week, the scent (smoky), and the container for the food and the flour/palm oil mixture. In a Pomba Gira , another set of elements indicates a gentler coding: from rum to champagne or anisette, from the absence of flowers to red roses, from pepper in the flour/palm oil mixture to honey, and from a fierce initiatory act to a song, which seems to suit the purpose of the ritual: to obtain a woman. (See Table One for the transition between Exu and Pomba Giras rituals)\n\nTable One: Differences Between Exu and Pomba Gira Rituals\n\nMarginal Locations \n\u2018Marginal locations\u2019 refer to areas containing magical and spiritual significance where rituals are executed. Many Quimbanda rituals are performed at crossroads, as Exu is the Lord of the seven crossroads and Ogum is the Lord of the center of the crossroads. Other marginal locations include the streets at night (since Exus are referred to as \u2018people of the streets\u2019), cemeteries, beaches, and forests, all during the nighttime.\n\nAnimal Sacrifices \n\nIn certain rituals with Kiumbas (aspiring to become Exus), devotees offer sacrificial pigeons, hens, roosters, goats, sheep, and bulls to help a spirit progress in power and capability. Other rituals use animal sacrifices to enlist the help of a spirit to carry out a deed.\n\nHistory\n\nFrom Africa to Brazil \nQuimbanda originated in South America and developed in the Portuguese Empire. The Atlantic slave trade brought African cultural presence to the Americas. In Brazil, by the mid 19th century the slave population outnumbered the free population. The slave population increased when free men of African descent (libertos) were added to the slave population. The African culture brought by slaves to Brazil slowly mixed with the Indigenous American and European culture. In the large urban centers such as Rio de Janeiro, where the African-slave population was the most concentrated, the Colonial regime enforced a social control system to suppress the rising population. However, instead of suppressing the African slave population, the Colonial regime\u2019s system had the opposite effect; the system divided the slave population into \u2018nations\u2019, which preserved, protected, and even institutionalized African religious and secular traditions. The large cities where the slave population was most concentrated preserved Macumba, the forerunner of Quimbanda, and still hold the largest following of Quimbanda.\n\nCatholic Influence \nThe Catholic Church has had very little lasting effect on Quimbanda unlike other Afro-Brazilian religions such as Umbanda. The Catholic Church in Brazil was under the direct control of the Portuguese crown so it relied on the state to provide funds, resulting in a very understaffed clergy in Brazil. Subsequently, the main Catholic influence in Brazil was a lay brotherhood. Therefore, the Catholic Church received only a nominal conversion of the African slaves. Ironically, the Catholic Church adopted the Colonial crown\u2019s system of controlling the slave population, which in turn preserved African traditions.\n\nFrom Macumba to Quimbanda and Umbanda \nBefore Quimbanda became its own separate religion, it was contained inside the religious tradition of Macumba. During the late 19th century and into the mid 20th century, Macumba was a pejorative term for all religions deemed by the white-dominant class as primitive, demonic and superstitious black magic. However, as African culture continued to blend with the native Brazilian culture, Macumba morphed into two religions: Umbanda and Quimbanda. Umbanda represented the \u2018whitened\u2019 aspects of Macumba, drawing heavily on spiritual and hierarchical values of French Spiritism and Catholicism. On the other hand, Quimbanda represented the aspects of Macumba that were rejected in the whitening process, becoming \u2018the Macumba of Macumbas\u2019. The split between the black and white magic of Macumba has caused much debate over the unity or disunity of Quimbanda and Umbanda. Some believe that Quimbanda and Umbanda represent aspects or tendencies of a single system. Others believe that Quimbanda and Umbanda have morphed into their own religions with their own influences and beliefs.(see Table Two for differences between Quimbanda and Umbanda)\n\nTable Two: Differences Between Quimbanda and Umbanda\n\nThe emergence of Quimbanda \nUntil halfway through the 20th century, Quimbanda and other Afro-Brazilian religions were not considered to be religions at all. Instead, they were considered to be primitive, superstitious magic passed down intergenerationally from an African-slave past. The black consciousness movement and the women\u2019s movement of the late 1970s created the perfect environment for the emergence of Quimbanda. These movements helped acquire civil liberties during Brazil\u2019s long process of returning to democracy. Historians refer to this process as \u2018re-Africanization,\u2019 meaning the \"intentional assertion of aesthetics, theologies, and practices considered more African.\" The re-Africanization movement caused increased popularity and respect for Exus and Pomba Giras spirits previously viewed as illicit and demonic. Thus, the emergence of Quimbanda showed the Afro-Brazilian culture salvaging their traditional African religion from white-dominant class misinterpretations of superstitious black magic. This re-Africanization movement simultaneously protected Quimbanda from the prevalent ideology of \"whitening\" that influenced other Umbanda and other eclectic Afro-Brazilian religions.\n\nContemporary \nQuimbanda has had a quickly rising membership since its emergence in the 1970s, especially in urban areas of Southern Brazil. However, according to Brazil\u2019s 2000 census less than 1% of the population claimed to belong to Afro-Brazilian religions (including Quimbanda and Umbanda). Although very little of the Brazilian population claims to follow Quimbanda, many people from all social ranks use Quimbanda rituals occasionally. It is a common practice for businessmen to consult Exus before major business dealings.\n\nSee also \n Macumba\n Umbanda\n West African Vodun\n Exu\n Pomba Gira\n Ogum\n\nReferences\n\nWorks cited\n\nExternal links \n Mario dos Ventos, Kimbanda page of an English speaking Kimbandeiro\n The House of Quimbanda, page of the first formally established American house.\n http://www.starrycave.com/2014/05/the-firmeza-of-quimbanda.html?m=1\n\nAfro-American religion\nAfro-Brazilian culture\nBrazilian mythology\nReligion in Brazil\nReligious syncretism in Brazil", "machine_text": "Quimbanda is a syncretic Afro-Brazilian religion that originated in Brazil and is also practiced in other countries such as Venezuela, Uruguay, and Argentina.

Quimbanda is predominantly practiced by individuals of African descent in Brazil, but it has seen a rise in popularity in the Western Hemisphere in general. It is a religion that has been shrouded in mystery and often misrepresented. Quimbanda is not a form of black magic or Satanism, as many may wrongly assume, but a faith based on ancestral reverence and reverence for spirits which can be good or evil. The central focus of Quimbanda worship is the veneration of entities known as \"Exus\" and \"Pomba Giras,\" who are often described as mischievous, yet powerful spirits. These entities are considered intermediaries between the human world and the spiritual realm, and are believed to be able to aid in various aspects of life such as healing, protection, and prosperity, in exchange for offerings and sacrifices. Quimbanda practitioners are known as \"quimbandeiros,\" and their practices often include rituals, healing, divination, and mediumship. Quimbanda has a vast array of spiritual tools that they utilize such as various herbs, candles, tobacco, and animal sacrifice. These tools are used to communicate with the spirits and provide offerings to them. In recent years, Quimbanda has also gained popularity in the LGBTQ community in Brazil and has become a safe haven for queer and trans individuals who are looking for spiritual guidance.

In 1164, this appears as Cosonai, and in 1228 as Cossonai.\n\nUlrich von Cossonay gave the village church to the monastery in Romainm\u00f4tier in 1096. In 1224, it passed to the Benedictine monastery in Lutry, which built a priory in the second half of the 13th century.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Fushun\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Fushun (, formerly romanised as Fouchouen, using French spelling, also as Fuxi ()) is a prefecture level city in Liaoning province, China, about  east of Shenyang, with a population of 2,138,090 inhabitants (2010 census) and a total area of ,  of which is the city proper. Situated on the Hun River (\"muddy river\"), it is one of the industrial and economic development hubs in Liaoning.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Ming dynasty first constructed Fushun walled city in 1384. \"Fushun\" is an abbreviation of the Chinese \"(\", literally \"to pacify the frontiers; to guide the Yi foreigners\".\n\nThe Jurchen (Manchu) leader Nurhaci married his granddaughter by his son Abatai to the Ming dynasty General Li Yongfang after Li surrendered Fushun in 1618. The offspring of Li received the \"Third Class Viscount\" () title.\n\nFushun was in ruins in the one-and-a-half centuries of early Qing dynasty. In 1783, the new walled city was completed southwest of the old city. In 1908, Fushun became the seat of Xingren County (, later renamed to Fushun County). Fushun was occupied by Russia until 1905 and by Japan until 1945. With the Japanese victory over Imperial Russia and signing of the Treaty of Portsmouth, the South Manchuria branch (from Changchun to L\u00fcshun) of the China Far East Railway was transferred to Japanese control. South Manchuria Railway Company quickly expanded the system inherited from Russia to staggering proportions. Coal mines were developed at Fushun. Under the control of the Japanese and with 30 years of development, Fushun area became highly industrialized. Fushun gained city status in 1937.\n\nPopulation\nFushun has 2.14\u00a0million inhabitants, including 1.34\u00a0million in the urban area. It is now part of the Shenyang-Fushun built-up area (comprising all the urban and suburban districts of Shenyang and Fushun) which was home to 6,756,379 inhabitants in 2010. This makes Shenyang-Fushun the 8th most populous built up area in China after the Pearl River Delta conurbation of Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Dongguan, Foshan, Jiangmen, Zhongshan and Huizhou, then Shanghai-Suzhou, Beijing, Tianjin, Hangzhou-Shaoxing, Wuhan and Nanjing.\n\nAdministrative divisions\n\nFushun consists of 4 districts, 1 county and 2 autonomous counties.\n\nEconomy\n\nFushun is a highly industrialized area and nicknamed \"the City of Coal\". It has developed as a thriving center for fuel, power and raw materials and is also offering more and more opportunities in textiles and electronics. One of the world's largest open-pit coal mines, the West Open Mine, is located south of the city. Exploited from the 12th century, it was operated as an open pit mine during the 20th and early 21st Century; however, as of 2015, the West Open pit, 1,000 feet deep, with an area of 4.2 square miles, was exhausted and unstable. Total coal production in Fushun as a whole had fallen below 3\u00a0million tons, down from 18.3\u00a0million tons in 1962. Fushun has a major aluminum-reduction plant and factories producing automobiles, machinery, chemicals, cement, and rubber.\n\nThe total GDP of the city of Fushun was 54.27 billion yuan in 2009 (ranked 4th out of the 58 cities and counties in Liaoning province).

The main coal and oil shale company is Fushun Mining Group, which produced about 6\u00a0million tons of coal in 2001, mainly blending coking coal and steam coal. The company also has coalbed methane resources of around 8.9\u00a0billion cubic meters. In addition, it owns geological reserves of high grade oil shale, about 3.5\u00a0billion tons, of which the exploitable reserve is 920\u00a0million tons.\n\nIndustrial development\nHydroelectric and thermal power are important locally available energy sources.\n\nFushun has developed through the utilization of the abundant natural mineral deposits found in the area and is a nationally important heavy industrial base for petroleum, chemical, metallurgy machinery and construction material industries. New sectors also becoming prominent are electronics, light industry, weaving and spinning.\n\nIn 1928, the commercial-scale production of shale oil began in Fushun with the construction of Fushun Coal Mine Temporary Oil Plant () of South Manchurian Railway, aka the Western Refinery (), operating Fushun-type retorts. After World War II, shale oil production ceased, but 100\u00a0Fushun-type oil shale retorts and the related shale oil processing units were restored in 1949. In 1950, a total of 266\u00a0retorts were in operation, each with a capacity of 100\u2013200\u00a0tonnes of shale oil per day. In 1954, \"Refinery No. 2\" began production and in 1959 maximum annual shale oil production increased to 780,000\u00a0tonnes.\n\nFrom 1965 oil shale usage in Fushun started to decline with the discovery of Da Qing oil field in the 1960s. Sinopec, a shale oil producer during those times, shut down its oil shale operations in the beginning of the 1990s. At the same time, the Fushun Oil Shale Retorting Plant was established as a part of the Fushun Mining Group. It started production in 1992. In the same year, the China National Oil Shale Association was established in Fushun.\n\nAt the end of 2006, the Fushun Mining Group operated the largest shale oil plant in the world, consisting of seven retorting units with 20\u00a0retorts in each unit, for a total 140 sets of Fushun type retorts.\n\nThere are also two oil refineries. Fushun Petrochemical Company, a subsidiary of PetroChina, is building a refining and petrochemical complex in Fushun.\n\nTransportation\nFushun is located  from Shenyang Taoxian airport.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Social order\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The term social order can be used in two senses: In the first sense, it refers to a particular system of social structures and institutions. Examples are the ancient, the feudal, and the capitalist social order. In the second sense, social order is contrasted to social chaos or disorder and refers to a stable state of society in which the existing social structure is accepted and maintained by its members. The problem of order or Hobbesian problem, which is central to much of sociology, political science and political philosophy, is the question of how and why it is that social orders exist at all.\n\nSociology\nThomas Hobbes is recognized as the first to clearly formulate the problem, to answer which he conceived the notion of a social contract.\nSocial theorists (such as Karl Marx, \u00c9mile Durkheim, Talcott Parsons, and J\u00fcrgen Habermas) have proposed different explanations for what a social order consists of, and what its real basis is. For Marx, it is the relations of production or economic structure which is the basis of social order. For Durkheim, it is a set of shared social norms. For Parsons, it is a set of social institutions regulating the pattern of action-orientation, which again are based on a frame of cultural values. For Habermas, it is all of these, as well as communicative action.\n\nPrinciple of extensiveness\nAnother key factor concerning social order is the principle of extensiveness. This states the more norms and the more important the norms are to a society, the better these norms tie and hold together the group as a whole.\n\nA good example of this is smaller religions based in the U.S., such as the Amish. Many Amish live together in communities and because they share the same religion and values, it is easier for them to succeed in upholding their religion and views because their way of life is the norm for their community.\n\nGroups and networks\nIn every society, people belong to groups, such as businesses, families, churches, athletic groups, or neighborhoods. The structure inside of these groups mirrors that of the whole society. There are networks and ties between groups, as well as inside of each of the groups, which create social order.\n\nSome people belong to more than one group, and this can sometimes cause conflict. The individual may encounter a situation in which he or she has to choose one group over another. Many who have studied these groups believe that it is necessary to have ties between groups to strengthen the society as a whole, and to promote pride within each group. Others believe that it is best to have stronger ties to a group, enabling social norms and values to be reinforced.\n\nStatus groups\n\"Status groups\" can be based on a person's characteristics such as race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, caste, region, occupation, physical attractiveness, gender, education, age, etc. They are defined as \"a subculture having a rather specific rank (or status) within the stratification system. That is, societies tend to include a hierarchy of status groups, some enjoying high ranking and some low.\" One example of this hierarchy is the prestige of a school teacher compared to that of a garbage man.\n\nA certain lifestyle usually distinguishes the members of different status groups. For example, around the holidays a Jewish family may celebrate Hanukkah while a Christian family may celebrate Christmas. Other cultural differences such as language and cultural rituals identify members of different status groups.\n\nSmaller groups exist inside of one status group. For instance, one can belong to a status group based on one's race and a social class based on financial ranking. This may cause strife for the individual in this situation when he or she feels they must choose to side with either their status group or their social class. For example, a wealthy African American man who feels he has to take a side on an issue on which the opinions of poor African Americans and wealthy white Americans are divided and finds his class and status group opposed.\n\nValues and norms\nValues can be defined as \"internal criteria for evaluation\". Values are also split into two categories, there are individual values, which pertains to something that we think has worth and then there are social values. Social values are our desires modified according to ethical principles or according to the group, we associate with: friends, family, or co-workers.\nNorms tell us what people ought to do in a given situation. Unlike values, norms are enforced externally\u00a0\u2013 or outside of oneself. A society as a whole determines norms, and they can be passed down from generation to generation.\n\nPower and authority\nAn exception to the idea of values and norms as social order-keepers is deviant behavior. Not everyone in a society abides by a set of personal values or the group's norms all the time. For this reason, it is generally deemed necessary for a society to have authority. The adverse opinion holds that the need for authority stems from social inequality. \n\nIn a class society, those who hold positions of power and authority are among the upper class. Norms differ for each class because the members of each class were raised differently and hold different sets of values. Tension can form, therefore, between the upper class and lower class when laws and rules are put in place that do not conform to the values of both classes.\n\nSpontaneous order\nThe order does not necessarily need to be controlled by the government.  Individuals pursuing self-interest can make predictable systems.  These systems, being planned by more than one person, may actually be preferable to those planned by a single person.  This means that predictability may be possible to achieve without a central government's control.  These stable expectations do not necessarily lead to individuals behaving in ways that are considered beneficial to group welfare.  Considering this, Thomas Schelling studied neighborhood racial segregation. His findings suggest that interaction can produce predictability, but it does not always increase social order.  In his researching, he found that \"when all individuals pursue their own preferences, the outcome is segregation rather than integration,\" as stated in \"Theories of Social Order\", edited by Michael Hechter and Christine Horne.\n\nSocial honor\nSocial honor can also be referred to as social status. It is considered the distribution of prestige or \"the approval, respect, admiration, or deference a person or group is able to command by virtue of his or its imputed qualities or performances\". The case most often is that people associate social honor with the place a person occupies with material systems of wealth and power. Since most of the society finds wealth and power desirable, they respect or envy people that have more than they do. When social honor is referred to as social status, it deals with the rank of a person within the stratification system. Status can be achieved, which is when a person position is gained on the basis of merit or in other words by achievement and hard work or it can be ascribed, which is when a person position is assigned to individuals or groups without regard for merit but because of certain traits beyond their control, such as race, sex, or parental social standing. An example of ascribed status is Kate Middleton who married a prince. An example of achieved status is Oprah Winfrey, an African American woman from poverty who worked her way to being a billionaire.\n\nAttainment\nTwo different theories exist that explain and attempt to account for social order. The first theory is \"order results from a large number of independent decisions to transfer individual rights and liberties to a coercive state in return for its guarantee of security for persons and their property, as well as its establishment of mechanisms to resolve disputes,\" as stated in Theories of Social Order by Hechter and Horne. The next theory is that \"the ultimate source of social order as residing not in external controls but in a concordance of specific values and norms that individuals somehow have managed to internalize.\" also stated in Theories of Social Order by Hechter and Horne. Both arguments for how social order is attained are very different. One argues that it is achieved through outside influence and control, and the other argues that it can only be attained when the individual willingly follows norms and values that they have grown accustomed to and internalized. Weber's insistence on the importance of domination and symbolic systems in social life was retained by Pierre Bourdieu, who developed the idea of social orders, ultimately transforming it into a theory of fields.\n\nSee also\n\n Anti-social behaviour\n Antinomianism\n Conformity\n Marx's theory of history\n Norm (sociology)\n Social hierarchy\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n \n Hobbes, T.

It is a complex phenomenon that arises from the interaction of multiple factors such as culture, history, geography, and politics. Social order dictates what is considered acceptable or unacceptable behavior within a given society, providing a framework for individual action that allows people to predict how others will behave. The concept of social order has been the focus of much academic debate over the years. Some scholars have argued that social order is inherently oppressive, designed to maintain the power and privilege of dominant groups at the expense of others. Others have suggested that social order is a necessary condition for the functioning of society and that without it, chaos and anarchy would ensue. Regardless of one's perspective, the fact remains that social order is an essential feature of human society. It provides a sense of stability and predictability, allowing people to interact with one another in a relatively smooth and efficient manner. Without social order, societies would be unable to function, and individuals would be left to fend for themselves in a world characterized by constant conflict and uncertainty. There are many different types of social order, each with its own set of norms, values, and expectations. Some societies maintain social order through the use of formal institutions such as churches, governments, and legal systems. Others rely on informal mechanisms such as customs, traditions, and social norms. Still, others use a mixture of both formal and informal methods to maintain social order. Ultimately, the nature of social order varies from society to society and depends on a host of factors. Whether one sees it as a force for good or a source of oppression, social order remains one of the defining features of human society and a crucial factor in our ability to live together in peace and harmony.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 396418}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Richard Breitman\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Richard David Breitman, born in 1947, is an American historian best known for his study of the Holocaust.\n\nRichard Breitman is an American historian who has written extensively on modern German history, the Holocaust, American immigration and refugee policy, and intelligence during and after World War II. He has spent his career in the history department at American University in Washington, D.C. from which he retired as distinguished professor emeritus in 2015. He has written or co-authored twelve books and served for twenty-five years as editor of Holocaust and Genocide Studies, a scholarly journal owned by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.\n\nEducation and career \nBreitman was born in 1947, in Connecticut. His grandparents had emigrated to the U.S. from Odessa and Krakow in 1905 and settled in Hartford, CT. His parents were American-born, his father, Saul, a businessman, his mother, Gloria (nee Salz) a homemaker. Breitman attended public schools in West Hartford, and he credits an inspiring high school history teacher, Robert Derosier, with bringing European history to life for him.\n\nBreitman graduated from Yale summa cum laude and earned both his M.A. and Ph.D. in modern European history at Harvard. His first book, German Socialism and Weimar Democracy (University of North Carolina Press, 1981), explored the tensions between socialist goals and democratic convictions in the Social Democratic Party of Germany during the Weimar Republic.\n\nNot long after, Breitman read an article by the famous historian Walter Laqueur that traced[js1]\u00a0 the story of an anonymous German industrialist who in 1942 brought to the West information about Hitler\u2019s planned use of gas chambers and crematoria to destroy European Jewry. This man\u2019s identity had remained a mystery for decades. Breitman, after months of archival research, proved that he was Eduard Schulte, a prominent but secret anti-Nazi CEO of a large mining firm who traveled frequently between Germany and Switzerland. Together, Breitman and Laqueur then wrote Schulte\u2019s story that detailed the muted reactions to his warnings: Breaking the Silence: the German Who Exposed the Final Solution (Simon & Schuster, 1986; University Press of new England, 1991). Translated into several languages, it remains in print.\n\nIn 1994, Breitman requested that the National Security Agency declassify its holdings of World War II intercepts and decodes of enemy radio messages. The NSA Historical Cryptographic Collection, amounting to some 1.3 million pages, was turned over to the U.S. National Archives. In this mass, Breitman found a small file of British decodes of German police radio messages that revealed important information about the first stage of the Holocaust. Prodded by Parliament, the British government followed with its own, larger, declassification of German police decodes. Breitman mined both archives for his 1998 book Official Secrets: What the Nazis Planned, What the British and Americans Knew (Hill & Wang). Still in print in a number of languages, it examines the relationships among German, British, and American policies toward European Jews.\n\nBreitman then served as director of historical research for a small U.S. government body set up to oversee implementation of a 1998 declassification law called the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act. This organization helped to declassify more than eight million pages of U.S. government records, and a team of four historians used them to write U.S. Intelligence and the Nazis (Cambridge University Press, 2005).\n\nBreitman\u2019s best-known books are The Architect of Genocide: Himmler and the Final Solution (Alfred A. Knopf, 1991), which made the case for Heinrich Himmler\u2019s central planning of the Holocaust; and a work co-authored with Allan J. Lichtman, FDR and the Jews (Belknap-Harvard, 2013). In the latter, Breitman and Lichtman argued that Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s policies toward European Jewry fluctuated substantially over time according to circumstances and political calculations and constraints, but that his record nonetheless compared well with that of Winston Churchill, and also with later presidents when they were confronted with genocide abroad. Both books won prizes.\n\n\u00a0In 2019 Public Affairs published a book by Breitman about a previously overlooked mid-level American consul and diplomat based in Berlin from 1930 to 1939, Raymond Geist. Despite his modest rank, Geist was superb at dealing with Nazi officials and for urging greater use of the U.S. immigration quota for Germany to help Jews escape from Nazi persecution. Geist personally provided a visa to Albert Einstein (and his wife) and helped extract Sigmund Freud from Vienna. In December 1938 Geist, who had a secret source high in the Gestapo, predicted the coming Holocaust. That he was secretly gay made Geist\u2019s career and his achievements all the more remarkable.\n\nIn 1999 Breitman received an honorary doctorate from Hebrew Union College, and in 2018 he was given a Distinguished Achievement Award from the Holocaust Educational Foundation.\n\nHe and his wife, Carol Rose (nee Wax), live in the Washington, DC area where he continues to write.\n\nPublications \n\nGerman Socialism and Weimar Democracy, Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1981\nWalter Laqueur and Richard Breitman, Breaking the Silence, New York: Simon and Schuster, 1986.\nRichard Breitman and Alan Kraut, American Refugee Policy and European Jewry, 1933-1945, Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1987.\nThe Architect of Genocide: Himmler and the Final Solution, New York: Alfred A.

This species is widely distributed in eastern Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands. The wingspan of Papilio hyppason ranges from 110 to 135 mm, and the wings are characterized by a bright yellow color with contrasting black markings. The hindwings have a long tail and two red spots near the edge. The female of this species is slightly larger than the male and has a more rounded wing shape. The Hyppason swallowtail inhabits various types of forested areas, including rainforests, montane forests, and disturbed habitats, such as plantations and gardens. It is a solitary species that feeds on the nectar of flowers and occasionally on fallen fruit. The larvae typically feed on host plants from the Lauraceae family, such as Litsea spp. and Cinnamomum spp. Papilio hyppason is considered a relatively common species throughout its range, and there are no known immediate threats to its survival. However, habitat loss and degradation due to deforestation, logging, and land use change could pose future threats to its populations. This species has cultural significance to the people of the Papua New Guinea highlands, where it is called \"Kululu\". According to local folklore, the butterfly symbolizes the soul of a killed warrior that has come back to earth in the form of this beautiful creature. The Hyppason swallowtail is also popular among butterfly collectors, and its beautiful appearance and relatively ease of breeding make it a favorite among enthusiasts. As with all exotic pets, proper care and attention is required to ensure the animal's health and wellbeing. In conclusion, Papilio hyppason is a colorful and enchanting butterfly species that is widespread throughout eastern Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands. Its beauty and cultural significance make it an important part of the region's natural and social heritage.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 28934753}

Located on a rocky ridge overlooking a loop of the Ourthe river, its origins go back to a Celtic oppidum.\n\nHistory\nThe castle was built on the ruins of a Celtic oppidum, on a site where human presence dates back to Neolithic times. The Romans later established a fortified camp there. In the early eighth century, Pepin Landen built a villa on the site.\n\nThe first castle was built in 844 (approximately) by Adelard, Count of La Roche. After the death of Henri de la Roche in 1152, the countship passed to Henri the Blind Count of Namur, and upon his death in 1196, to his daughter Ermesinde of Luxembourg and thus to the line of the counts of Luxembourg.\n\nIn the 14th century, the inhabitants of La Roche were authorized by Jean the Blind, count of Luxembourg, to protect their city by a wall and towers that strengthened the defensive system of the castle.\n\nThe strategic importance of the castle did not escape Louis XIV. From 1681 to 1688, he had a student of Vauban reinforce the structures. However, these improvements did not benefit him much since the castle was taken by the winners of the War of Succession of Spain and they neglected it little by little.\n\nThe misfortunes of the castle continued in 1721, when it was badly damaged by a fire caused by lightning. Joseph II of Austria then dismantled it. It was the prey of vandals in the nineteenth century, and it also was damaged in the bombing of December 1944 during the Battle of the Bulge.\n\nFortunately for history and architecture enthusiasts, the ruins of the castle of La Roche-en-Ardenne still constitute today a beautiful example of military architecture throughout the ages.\n\nSee also\nList of castles in Belgium\n\nExternal links \nOfficial website La Roche-en-Ardenne Castle\nLa Roche-en-Ardenne Castle at www.castles.nl\n\nCastles in the Ardennes (Belgium)\nRuined castles in Belgium\nCastles in Belgium\nCastles in Luxembourg (Belgium)\nLa Roche-en-Ardenne Castle\nDuchy of Luxembourg", "machine_text": "La Roche-en-Ardenne Castle is a medieval castle situated in the town of La Roche-en-Ardenne, in the Belgian Ardennes.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Cat Person\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "\"Cat Person\" is a short story by Kristen Roupenian that was first published in December 2017 in The New Yorker before going viral online. The BBC described the short story as \"being shared widely online as social media users discuss how much it relates to modern day dating\".\n\nThe novel is currently being adapted to a film of the same name directed by Susanna Fogel.\n\nSynopsis\nThe story follows the brief relationship of Margot, a twenty-year-old sophomore college student, and Robert, an older man who is a regular at the movie theater where Margot works. After an exchange at the concession stand, he asks for her number, and they carry on extensive conversations through texts. Margot finds Robert witty and funny through text, and their conversations grow frequent, but he is more awkward and inscrutable when she tries to see him in person.\n\nWhen Margot returns from visiting home for winter break, she and Robert go on a real date: they see a movie, go to a bar (during which Robert learns her age), and then return to Robert's home. Despite being disappointed and uncomfortable during the date, Margot consents to sex with Robert rather than navigate turning him down. After the encounter, which largely disgusts her, Margot learns that Robert is thirty-four years old and reflects that their conversations have been impersonal.\n\nMargot resolves to tell Robert she isn't interested in continuing to see him, but ignores his messages while she is unsure of how to do it politely but firmly. She eventually does so abruptly through text at the urging of her roommate. A month later, she sees Robert while out at a bar with her friends; she is unsettled by the idea that he is looking for her and avoids him. That night, he texts her repeatedly, his messages at first complimentary and insecure but becoming more needy and belligerent as Margot does not reply, ending with calling her a \"Whore\".\n\nReception\nThe Washington Post described \"Cat Person\" as unique among the content in The New Yorker because it resonated with a younger audience, commenting: \"for one of the first times, something in the magazine seemed to capture the experience not of print-oriented, older intellectuals, but of Millennials.\" The story was the year's most downloaded fiction published in The New Yorker, and one of the most-read pieces overall of 2017. The Atlantic notes that \"The depiction of uncomfortable romance in 'Cat Person' seems to resonate with countless women\", and describes it as a \"literary adjunct to the latest #MeToo moment\". Personal reactions have been largely, but not entirely, along gender lines (drawing comparisons to Jane Austen), and for many readers, it captures what it is like to be a woman in her twenties in 2017, including \"the desperate need to be considered polite and nice at all costs\".\n\nFollowing the story's success, Roupenian secured a seven-figure deal with Scout Press for her debut book, and was the subject of a bidding war in the American market, with offers exceeding $1 million.\nShe received a $1.2 million advance for her 2019 book You Know You Want This, an anthology series which includes \"Cat Person\".\n\nControversy\nIn July 2021, Alexis Nowicki published an essay in Slate magazine alleging that Roupenian had appropriated details from Nowicki's life and that of her lover, and used them for \"Cat Person\", with Margot representing Nowicki and Robert representing Nowicki's former partner, only identified in the essay by the pseudonym \"Charles\".\n\nSocial media users reacted strongly to Nowicki's allegations. In the words of Elisabeth de Mariaffi, in Maclean's, \"Twitter went wild, with readers struggling to understand how a writer could justify using such real-life details, and writers rallying to defend themselves.\" The Guardian writer Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett described the potential for readers to feel that \"using someone else's story in this way was unethical.\"\n\nIn a 2021 email reply to Nowicki, Roupenian said she had an \"encounter\" with Charles and that she later found out about Nowicki through social media. Roupenian acknowledged that information she learned from Nowicki's social media served as a \"jumping-off point\" for \"a story that was primarily a work of the imagination, but which also drew on my own personal experiences, both past and present.\" She apologized for not changing particulars such as Nowicki's hometown, stating \"I can absolutely see why the inclusion of those details in the story would cause you significant pain and confusion.\"\n\nNowicki's essay points out salient differences between \"Cat Person\" and her relationship. Elisabeth de Mariaffi notes that \"the entire weight of Cat Person, what made it resonate, was exactly the part that Nowicki says bears no resemblance to the truth.\"\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \"Cat Person\" at The New Yorker\n What It Felt Like When \"Cat Person\" Went Viral\n \"Cat Person\" and Me by Alexis Nowicki\n\n2017 short stories\nWorks originally published in The New Yorker\n2017 in women's history\nAmerican short stories", "machine_text": "Cat Person is a term often used to describe someone who loves and is passionate about cats.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Antares\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Antares (pronounced  ), designated \u03b1 Scorpii (Latinised to Alpha Scorpii), is on average the fifteenth-brightest star in the night sky, and the brightest object in the constellation of Scorpius. Distinctly reddish when viewed with the naked eye, Antares is a slow irregular variable star that ranges in brightness from apparent magnitude +0.6 to +1.6. Often referred to as \"the heart of the scorpion\", Antares is flanked by \u03c3 Scorpii and \u03c4 Scorpii near the center of the constellation.\n\nClassified as spectral type M1.5Iab-Ib, Antares is a red supergiant, a large evolved massive star and one of the largest stars visible to the naked eye.  Its exact size remains uncertain, but if placed at the center of the Solar System, it would reach to somewhere between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Its mass is calculated to be around 12 times that of the Sun.\n\nAntares is the brightest, most massive, and most evolved stellar member of the nearest OB association, the Scorpius\u2013Centaurus Association, located at the rim of the Upper Scorpius part illuminating the Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex in its foreground. Antares is a member of the Upper Scorpius subgroup of the association, which contains thousands of stars with a mean age of 11 million years, about  from Earth.\n\nAntares appears as a single star when viewed with the naked eye, but it is actually a binary star, with its two components called \u03b1 Scorpii A and \u03b1 Scorpii B.  The brighter of the pair is the red supergiant, while the fainter is a hot main sequence star of magnitude 5.5.\n\nNomenclature\n\n\u03b1 Scorpii (Latinised to Alpha Scorpii) is the star's Bayer designation. Antares has the Flamsteed designation 21 Scorpii, as well as catalogue designations such as HR 6134 in the Bright Star Catalogue and HD 148478 in the Henry Draper Catalogue. As a prominent infrared source, it appears in the Two Micron All-Sky Survey catalogue as 2MASS J16292443-2625549 and the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) Sky Survey Atlas catalogue as IRAS 16262\u20132619. It is also catalogued as a double star WDS J16294-2626 and CCDM J16294-2626.  Antares is a variable star and is listed in the General Catalogue of Variable Stars but as a Bayer-designated star it does not have a separate variable star designation.\n\nIts traditional name Antares derives from the Ancient Greek , meaning \"rival to-Ares\" (\"opponent to-Mars\"), due to the similarity of its reddish hue to the appearance of the planet Mars. The comparison of Antares with Mars may have originated with early Mesopotamian astronomers which is considered an outdated speculation because the name of this star in Mesopotamian astronomy has always been \"heart of Scorpon\" and it was associated with Goddess Lisi(n). Some scholars have speculated that the star may have been named after Antar, or Antarah ibn Shaddad, the Arab warrior-hero celebrated in the pre-Islamic poems Mu'allaqat. However, the name \"Antares\" is already proven in the Greek culture, e.g. in Ptolemy's Almagest and Tetrabiblos. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organised a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardise proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN, which included Antares for the star \u03b1 Scorpii A. It is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.\n\nObservation \nAntares is visible all night around May 31 of each year, when the star is at opposition to the Sun. Antares then rises at dusk and sets at dawn as seen at the equator.\n\nFor two to three weeks on either side of November 30, Antares is not visible in the night sky from mid-northern latitudes, because it is near conjunction with the Sun. In higher northern latitudes, Antares is only visible low in the south in summertime. Higher than 64\u00b0 northern latitude, the star does not rise at all.\n\nAntares is easier to see from the southern hemisphere due to its southerly declination. In the whole of Antarctica, the star is circumpolar as the whole continent is above 64\u00b0 S latitude.\n\nHistory \nRadial velocity variations were observed in the spectrum of Antares in the early 20th century and attempts were made to derive spectroscopic orbits.  It became apparent that the small variations could not be due to orbital motion, and were actually caused by pulsation of the star's atmosphere.  Even in 1928, it was calculated that the size of the star must vary by about 20%.\n\nAntares was first reported to have a companion star by Johann Tobias B\u00fcrg during an occultation on April 13, 1819, although this was not widely accepted and dismissed as a possible atmospheric effect.  It was then observed by Scottish astronomer James William Grant FRSE while in India on 23 July 1844. It was rediscovered by Ormsby M. Mitchel in 1846, and measured by William Rutter Dawes in April 1847.\n\nIn 1952, Antares was reported to vary in brightness.  A photographic magnitude range from 3.00 to 3.16 was described.  The brightness has been monitored by the American Association of Variable Star Observers since 1945, and it has been classified as an LC slow irregular variable star, whose apparent magnitude slowly varies between extremes of +0.6 and +1.6, although usually near magnitude +1.0. There is no obvious periodicity, but statistical analyses have suggested periods of 1,733 days or  days. No separate long secondary period has been detected, although it has been suggested that primary periods longer than a thousand days are analogous to long secondary periods.\n\nResearch published in 2018 demonstrated that Ngarrindjeri Aboriginal people from South Australia observed the variability of Antares and incorporated it into their oral traditions as Waiyungari (meaning 'red man').\n\nOccultations and conjunctions \n\nAntares is 4.57 degrees south of the ecliptic, one of four first magnitude stars within 6\u00b0 of the ecliptic (the others are Spica, Regulus and Aldebaran), so it can be occulted by the Moon. The occultation of 31 July 2009 was visible in much of southern Asia and the Middle East. Every year around December 2 the Sun passes 5\u00b0 north of Antares. Lunar occultations of Antares are fairly common, depending on the 18.6-year cycle of the lunar nodes. The last cycle ended in 2010 and the next begins in 2023. Shown at right is a video of a reappearance event, clearly showing events for both components.\n\nAntares can also be occulted by the planets, e.g. Venus, but these events are rare. The last occultation of Antares by Venus took place on September 17, 525 BC; the next one will be November 17, 2400. Other planets have been calculated not to have occulted Antares over the last millennium, nor will they in the next millennium, as most planets stay near the ecliptic and pass north of Antares. Venus will be extremely near Antares on October 19, 2117 and every eight years thereafter through to October 29, 2157 it will pass south of the star.\n\nIllumination of Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex \nAntares illuminates foreground parts of the Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex. The illuminated cloud is sometimes referred to as the Antares Nebula or is otherwise identified as VdB 107, Ced 132, DG 141, LBN 1107 and Magakian 668.\n\nStellar system\n\u03b1 Scorpii is a double star that is thought to form a binary system. The best calculated orbit for the stars is still considered to be unreliable.  It describes an almost circular orbit seen nearly edge-on, with a period of 1,218 years and a semi-major axis of about .  Other recent estimates of the period have ranged from 880 years for a calculated orbit, to 2,562 years for a simple Kepler's Law estimate.\n\nEarly measurements of the pair found them to be about  apart in 1847\u201349, or  apart in 1848.  More modern observations consistently give separations around . The variations in the separation are often interpreted as evidence of orbital motion, but are more likely to be simply observational inaccuracies with very little true relative motion between the two components.\n\nThe pair have a projected separation of about 529 astronomical units (AU) (\u2248 80 billion km) at the estimated distance of Antares, giving a minimum value for the distance between them. Spectroscopic examination of the energy states in the outflow of matter from the companion star suggests that it is over  beyond the primary (more than 110 billion km).\n\nAntares\n\nAntares is a red supergiant star with a stellar classification of M1.5Iab-Ib, and is indicated to be a spectral standard for that class. Due to the nature of the star, the derived parallax measurements have large errors, so that the true distance of Antares is approximately  from the Sun.\n\nThe brightness of Antares at visual wavelengths is about 10,000 times that of the Sun, but because the star radiates a considerable part of its energy in the infrared part of the spectrum, the true bolometric luminosity is around 100,000 times that of the Sun. There is a large margin of error assigned to values for the bolometric luminosity, typically 30% or more. There is also considerable variation between values published by different authors, for example  and  published in 2012 and 2013.\n\nThe mass of the star has been calculated to be about , or . Comparison of the effective temperature and luminosity of Antares to theoretical evolutionary tracks for massive stars suggest a progenitor mass of  and an age of 12 million years (MYr), or an initial mass of  and an age of 11 to 15 MYr. Massive stars like Antares are expected to explode as supernovae.\n\nLike most cool supergiants, Antares's size has much uncertainty due to the tenuous and translucent nature of the extended outer regions of the star. Defining an effective temperature is difficult due to spectral lines being generated at different depths in the atmosphere, and linear measurements produce different results depending on the wavelength observed. In addition, Antares appears to pulsate, varying its radius by 19%. It also varies in temperature by 150 K, lagging 70 days behind radial velocity changes which are likely to be caused by the pulsations.\n\nThe diameter of Antares can be measured most accurately using interferometry or observing lunar occultations events. An apparent diameter from occultations 41.3 \u00b1 0.1 milliarcseconds has been published. Interferometry allows synthesis of a view of the stellar disc, which is then represented as a limb-darkened disk surrounded by an extended atmosphere. The diameter of the limb-darkened disk was measured as  in 2009 and  in 2010. The linear radius of the star can be calculated from its angular diameter and distance. However, the distance to Antares is not known with the same accuracy as modern measurements of its diameter.\n\nThe Hipparcos satellite's trigonometric parallax of  leads to a radius of about . Older radii estimates exceeding  were derived from older measurements of the diameter, but those measurements are likely to have been affected by asymmetry of the atmosphere and the narrow range of infrared wavelengths observed; Antares has an extended shell which radiates strongly at those particular wavelengths. Despite its large size compared to the Sun, Antares is dwarfed by even larger red supergiants, such as VY Canis Majoris or VV Cephei A and Mu Cephei.\n\nAntares, like the similarly sized red supergiant Betelgeuse in the constellation Orion, will almost certainly explode as a supernova, possibly in the next ten thousand years. For a few months, the Antares supernova could be as bright as the full moon and be visible in daytime.\n\nAntares B\nAntares B is a magnitude 5.5 blue-white main-sequence star of spectral type B2.5V; it also has numerous unusual spectral lines suggesting it has been polluted by matter ejected by Antares.  It is assumed to be a relatively normal early-B main sequence star with a mass around , a temperature around , and a radius of about .\n\nAntares B is normally difficult to see in small telescopes due to glare from Antares, but can sometimes be seen in apertures over . It is often described as green, but this is probably either a contrast effect, or the result of the mixing of light from the two stars when they are seen together through a telescope and are too close to be completely resolved. Antares B can sometimes be observed with a small telescope for a few seconds during lunar occultations while Antares is hidden by the Moon.  Antares B appears a profound blue or bluish-green color, in contrast to the orange-red Antares.\n\nEtymology and mythology\n\nIn the Babylonian star catalogues dating from at least 1100 BCE, Antares was called GABA GIR.TAB, \"the Breast of the Scorpion\". In MUL.APIN, which dates between 1100 and 700 BC, it is one of the stars of Ea in the southern sky and denotes the breast of the Scorpion goddess Ishhara. Later names that translate as \"the Heart of Scorpion\" include  from the Arabic \u0642\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0628\u064f \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0642\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0628\u0650 . This had been directly translated from the Ancient Greek  .  was a calque of the Greek name rendered in Latin.\n\nIn ancient Mesopotamia, Antares may have been known by various names: Urbat, Bilu-sha-ziri (\"the Lord of the Seed\"), Kak-shisa (\"the Creator of Prosperity\"), Dar Lugal (\"The King\"), Masu Sar (\"the Hero and the King\"), and Kakkab Bir (\"the Vermilion Star\"). In ancient Egypt, Antares represented the scorpion goddess Serket (and was the symbol of Isis in the pyramidal ceremonies). It was called tms n hntt \"the red one of the prow\".  \n\nIn Persia Antares was known as Satevis, one of the four \"royal stars\". In India, it with \u03c3 Scorpii and \u03c4 Scorpii were Jyeshth\u0101 (the eldest or biggest, probably attributing its huge size), one of the nakshatra (Hindu lunar mansions).\n\nThe ancient Chinese called Antares \u5fc3\u5bbf\u4e8c (X\u012bnxi\u00f9'\u00e8r, \"second star of the Heart\"), because it was the second star of the mansion Xin (\u5fc3). It was the national star of the Shang Dynasty, and it was sometimes referred to as () because of its reddish appearance.\n\nThe M\u0101ori people of New Zealand call Antares R\u0113hua, and regard it as the chief of all the stars. R\u0113hua is father of Puanga/Puaka (Rigel), an important star in the calculation of the M\u0101ori calendar. The Wotjobaluk Koori people of Victoria, Australia, knew Antares as Djuit, son of Marpean-kurrk (Arcturus); the stars on each side represented his wives. The Kulin Kooris saw Antares (Balayang) as the brother of Bunjil (Altair).\n\nIn culture \n\nAntares appears in the flag of Brazil, which displays 27 stars, each representing a federated unit of Brazil. Antares represents the state of Piau\u00ed.\n\nIn Saint Seiya, the popular 1986 manga, the character Milo represents the Scorpius constellation and uses moves and attacks named after its stars - being Antares the strongest one.\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\n\n Best Ever Image of a Star\u2019s Surface and Atmosphere - First map of motion of material on a star other than the Sun\n\nM-type supergiants\nB-type main-sequence stars\nBinary stars\nSlow irregular variables\nUpper Scorpius\n\nScorpius (constellation)\nAstronomical events in the near future\nScorpii, Alpha\nCD-26 11359\nScorpii, 21\n148478 9\n080763\n6134\nStars with proper names\nTIC objects", "machine_text": "Antares is a red supergiant star located in the constellation Scorpius. It is the brightest star in the constellation and the 15th brightest star in the night sky. Its name comes from the Greek word meaning \"rival of Mars\" because of its intense reddish hue resembling that of the planet. Antares is also known as Alpha Scorpii, as it is the brightest star in the pattern of Scorpius. Antares has a radius estimated to be around 883 times that of the Sun, making it one of the largest known stars. It is also one of the most massive, with a total mass estimated to be around 12 times that of the Sun. Antares is estimated to be around 550 light-years away from Earth. Despite its size and brightness, Antares is a relatively young star, with an estimated age of between 10 and 20 million years. Due to its massive size, Antares is expected to end its life in a supernova explosion, although this is not expected to happen for at least a few hundred thousand years. Antares has a companion star, which is much smaller and cooler than the main star. This companion star is difficult to observe directly due to its proximity to the much brighter main star. Antares has been observed by astronomers for thousands of years, and has been used as a navigational aid by sailors and travelers throughout history. In recent years, Antares has been studied extensively by astronomers using telescopes and other advanced instruments in order to learn more about its structure, evolution, and potential for future supernova explosions. Overall, Antares is an important and fascinating star that has captured the imagination of astronomers and stargazers alike for generations.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 3076}

It is in a fertile farming area in the Rangitikei District at the junction of State Highways 1 and 3 about 135 kilometres (84\u00a0mi) north of Wellington. According to a  Statistics New Zealand estimate, Bulls has a population of  inhabitants.\n\nRecent marketing makes puns with the name, for example, \"New Zealand gets its milk from Bulls\" or the sign for the local police station \"Const-a-bull\".\n\nEtymology\n\nThere are two recorded M\u0101ori toponyms for the area \u2013 Te Ara Taumaihi and \u014c-hine-puhiawe. The origins of Te Ara Taumaihi have yet to be explicitly explored. \u014c-hine-puhiawe, a land block where Parewahawaha marae is situated, acts as a synecdoche to refer to the current town area. The modern town name is named after James Bull who owned the first general store there. The town was originally called Bull Town, but this was changed to Clifton and then renamed back to Bulls at the urging of Sir William Fox.\n\nHistory and culture\n\nThe eastern end of the State Highway 1 bridge over the Rangitikei River south-east of the town collapsed suddenly in 1973 while being crossed by a bus. No-one was killed and the collapsed part was rebuilt.\n\nThe former Lake Alice Psychiatric hospital is 7\u00a0km (4\u00a0mi) north of Bulls, the hospital closed in 1999. Lake Alice was a large contributor to the Bulls and Marton economy.\n\nBulls is covered by the Whanganui Chronicle, a daily paper part of the NZ Herald network that serves the Whanganui, Ruapehu and Rangit\u012bkei regions.\n\nMarae\n\nThe local Parewahawaha Marae is a traditional meeting ground for the Ng\u0101ti Raukawa hap\u016b of Ng\u0101ti Parewahawaha. It is on land known as Ohinepuhiawe.\n\nThe marae features the Parewahawaha meeting house, a whare tupana opened on 15 April 1967 by Maori Queen Te Atairangikaahu. At the time it was opened, Te Rangi Pumamao was the rangatira at Parewahawaha. He had finished construction of the house, as previous builders had died.\n\nIn October 2020, the Government committed $1,248,067 from the Provincial Growth Fund to upgrade the marae and 5 others, creating 69 jobs.\n\nDemographics\n\nBulls, which covers , had a population of 1,935 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 345 people (21.7%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 204 people (11.8%) since the 2006 census. There were 693 households. There were 972 males and 963 females, giving a sex ratio of 1.01 males per female. The median age was 32.2 years (compared with 37.4 years nationally), with 477 people (24.7%) aged under 15 years, 426 (22.0%) aged 15 to 29, 759 (39.2%) aged 30 to 64, and 276 (14.3%) aged 65 or older.\n\nEthnicities were 78.1% European/P\u0101keh\u0101, 27.3% M\u0101ori, 7.8% Pacific peoples, 3.1% Asian, and 2.6% other ethnicities (totals add to more than 100% since people could identify with multiple ethnicities).\n\nThe proportion of people born overseas was 14.9%, compared with 27.1% nationally.\n\nAlthough some people objected to giving their religion, 54.1% had no religion, 33.0% were Christian, 0.6% were Hindu, 0.2% were Muslim, 0.3% were Buddhist and 3.9% had other religions.\n\nOf those at least 15 years old, 144 (9.9%) people had a bachelor or higher degree, and 321 (22.0%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $31,000, compared with $31,800 nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 747 (51.2%) people were employed full-time, 171 (11.7%) were part-time, and 60 (4.1%) were unemployed.\n\nGovernment and politics\n\nLocal government\n\nAs part of the Rangitikei District, the current Mayor of Rangitikei since 2013 is Andy Watson.\n\nBulls is the main town in the Southern ward of the Rangitikei District Council, which elects three of the eleven district councillors. The three councillors of the Southern ward are Brian Carter, Jane Dunn and Waru Panapa. The mayor and councillors are all due for re-election in October 2022.\n\nNational government\nBulls, like the rest of the Rangitikei District, is located in the general electorate of Rangit\u012bkei and the M\u0101ori electorate of Te Tai Hau\u0101uru. Rangit\u012bkei is a safe National Party seat since the 1938 election except for 1978\u20131984 when it was held by Bruce Beetham of the Social Credit Party. Since 2011 it has been held by Ian McKelvie.\n\nTe Tai Hau\u0101uru is a more unstable seat, having been held by three different parties since 1996, i.e. New Zealand First, the M\u0101ori Party and the Labour Party. Since 2014 it has been held by Adrian Rurawhe of the Labour Party.\n\nMilitary presence\nMany Air Force personnel from RNZAF Base Ohakea live in Bulls. In recent years several defence houses have been sold to civilian buyers which has seen a steady decline of servicemen from the area, but a moderate presence remains nonetheless.\n\nIn 2017 it was announced that the Republic of Singapore Air Force is looking at establishing a permanent F-15 fighter jet training base at Ohakea with an estimated presence of 500 Singaporean personnel. Ohakea and surrounding areas such as Bulls and Feilding would see a significant increase in military families and personnel to the area. In December 2018 it was announced that this would no longer go ahead.\n\nIn 2018 the incumbent government announced the purchase of four Boeing P-8 Poseidon aircraft for maritime surveillance. This announcement came with the news that the current New Zealand Defence Force unit responsible for maritime surveillance, No. 5 Squadron RNZAF, would be required to move to RNZAF Base Ohakea. This move would see a further increase in the number of service personnel living in the area. RNZAF is expected to take delivery of these aircraft in 2023.\n\nEducation \n\nBulls has two co-educational state primary schools for Year 1\u20138 students.\n\nBulls School was established in 1867 and is the oldest school in Rangitkei; it has a roll of  as of .\n\nClifton School, which opened more recently on the southern end of the township, has a roll of .\n\nSister city\nThe town's sister city is Cowes, England.\n\nNotable people\n Chris Amon, former Formula One driver between 1963\u20131976\n Travis Banks, professional wrestler\n Ormond Wilson, politician\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nUnforgetabull\n\nPopulated places in Manawat\u016b-Whanganui\nRangitikei District\nPopulated places on the Rangit\u012bkei River", "machine_text": "Bulls is a small town situated in the Rangitikei district of the Manawatu-Wanganui region of New Zealand. The town boasts a population of around 2,200 people and is named after James Bull, who was an early settler in the area. History: The town of Bulls was first established in the late 1860s and early 1870s. It was initially known as Bull Town and was established as a service center for the surrounding farming community. The town grew steadily over the years and became an important hub for the region. In 1886, the Bulls Borough Council was formed, which marked the beginning of the town's transformation into a proper township. The town's first mayor was William Barnicoat, who served in this capacity until his death in 1910. Attractions: The Bulls town is well-known for the quirky and humorous street signs that line its main street. These signs feature puns and jokes related to the town's name and have become an attraction in their own right. Another notable attraction in Bulls is the Bull Ring Market, which is held every Sunday and features a variety of stalls selling fresh produce, arts and crafts, and other products. The market is a popular destination for locals and visitors alike. The Bulls Museum is located in the town's historic railway station and provides an insight into the town's past and its importance to the wider region. Transport: Bulls is located on State Highway 1, which is the main arterial road that runs the length of New Zealand's North Island. The town is also serviced by a railway station, which provides a stop on the Northern Explorer, a long-distance passenger train that runs between Wellington and Auckland. In conclusion, Bulls is a charming and quirky town that has a rich history and a strong sense of community.

Other tracks on the EP include \"Back for More,\" \"Walkin' the Dog,\" \"Sweet Cheater,\" and \"You're in Trouble.\" Ratt (EP) received critical acclaim upon its release, with many praising the band's raw energy and musicianship. The EP helped establish Ratt as one of the leading bands of the Sunset Strip scene, and paved the way for their mainstream success in the mid-1980s. The band's signature style of melodic heavy metal, characterized by DeMartini's virtuosic guitar playing and Pearcy's distinctive vocals, was fully realized on this EP and would go on to influence countless other bands in the genre. Overall, Ratt (EP) remains a landmark release in the history of heavy metal, and a testament to the enduring legacy of Ratt themselves. With its timeless songs and unforgettable performances, this EP is a must-listen for any fan of hard rock and heavy metal music.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 3083389}

The main cup competition played in the area is the Dubai 9s, although a regional league under the name AFL Middle East which commenced in October 2008, with the inaugural 2008/09 premiers being the Dubai Heat.  The AFLME initially featured six clubs, three in Dubai and one each from Abu Dhabi, Muscat and Doha.\n\nAustralian football is not known as a spectator sport in the Middle East.  The first Australian Football League exhibition match was played in the United Emirates in 2008.  The only matches broadcast are AFL matches (particularly the AFL Grand Final) on satellite television in some countries through the Australia Network and on cable television in Israel.\n\nBahrain\nThe Bahrain Blues were created in 2009, making their debut at the Dubai 9s tournament in that year.  They will enter the AFL Middle East as the league's seventh club for the season starting in October 2009.\n\nIraq\nServicemen, mostly Australians in Iraq played a game on ANZAC Day in 2008 in the colours of Essendon Bombers and Collingwood Magpies to celebrate The ANZAC Day clash.\n\nIsrael and Palestine\n\nAustralian Rules in Israel has been played sporadically since the 1980s.\n\nThe earliest mentions of the sport were in the mid-1980s. \n\nIn the 1970s, there was no Aussie Rules, and expatriate Australian player David Stark took up rugby and playing in the lock position was part of the national rugby team in the 70s and 80s. \n\nBy 1984 a small band of followers was noted to be playing informally in 1984 in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and Yerucham parks. In 1986, groups of 24 players from the British Olim Society gathered to play matches following viewing of television footage of the VFL Grand Final.\n\nIn 1995, when a group of around 20 players began regular social matches in Tel Aviv, although most of the players were based in Jerusalem.  By 2005 the community was still playing with around 70 players involved and discussion about creating a four-team league with sides from Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and various youth programs.  The majority of the playing base were the members of the Jewish community in Melbourne who have emigrated to Israel.\n\nFor political reasons Israel is affiliated with the European chapter of the AFL organisation and participates in its events.\n\nA side representing Israel competed in both years of the Australian Football Multicultural Cup, winning the 2004 competition.\n\nA team composed of Australian Jews resident in London competed as Israel in the 2005 EU Cup.\n\nHighlights of the AFL Grand Final have been shown on Fox Sports Israel.\n\nAn idea to utilise the game Australian rules football as an instrument for forging peace between Israelis and Palestinians was suggested and carried out by Tanya Oziel of the Australian Jewish community in Sydney in late 2007.  \n\nConsequently the AFL Peace Team project was created by Tanya Oziel and curated by Peres Center for Peace and Innovation. This team was composed mainly of basketball and soccer players and volunteers, trained from scratch in the first half of 2008 to participate in 2008 Australian Football International Cup that took place in August 2018 in Australia. The project received a wide support in Australian business, sport and social circles, including Australian Jewish businessman and Carlton Football Club president Dick Pratt and AFL legend Ron Barassi.\n\nIn early 2008 there were initially around 75 players in training for the team, which was cut back to around 26 (13 Israelis, 13 Palestinians) for the squad to attend the International Cup.  Match-day coach for the team at the tournament was former player Robert DiPierdomenico.\n\nThe Peace Team also returned for the Australian Football International Cup in 2011. The project ended shortly thereafter.\n\nA few of the AFL Peace Team's graduates led by Yonatan Belik went on to establish the Jerusalem Peace Lions football club (JPL) in May 2015 continuing the peace effort. Team's management was actively recruiting both Israeli and Palestinian players residing in Jerusalem and surrounding areas. The club competed internationally representing Israel and the region in the 3 consecutive AFL Euro Cups 2015-2017.\n\nIn May 2018 a few former JPL players moved to Tel Aviv, and led by Shir Shalev started training in the HaYarkon park. In August 2018 they partnered with the sports platform OddBalls and formed the Tel Aviv Cheetahs football club. The Cheetahs and OddBalls are more focused on developing the sport itself rather than the activist work previously done by Peace Team and JPL, aiming to embed Australian rules football into Israeli cultural context and attract more local players. Prioritising the grassroots way of development the club's led to the club's squad being 3/4 Israeli. This allows the team to have a better chance at international European tournaments organised by AFL Europe, despite recent restrictions on the amount of Australian-born and raised participants allowed in the roster. Being the only active footy club in the region in 2018, the club went on to represent Israel internationally at the AFL Euro Cup 2018 in Cork, Ireland.\n\nIn May 2019 OddBalls and the Tel Aviv Cheetahs' management formed a national team, the Israeli Beasts, aiming to represent Israel in the AFL Euro Cup 2019 that will take place on 29 June in Sweden.\n\nLebanon\nAustralian Rules in Lebanon was first played around 2003 and 2004 in an attempt to introduce the sport into that country by members of the Lebanese community resident in Melbourne, this competition (based in Tripoli) has since gone into recess and there is no Australian rules currently played in Lebanon.\n\nA team representing the Melbourne Lebanese community also competed at the Australian Football Multicultural Cup in both 2004, 2005, 2010 & 2011, winning the cup three times and then a fourth in 2014.\n\nTeam Lebanon was taken over by new president and head coach Rick Kerbatieh, who successfully coached the team to its fourth Harmony Cup in 2014 and is preparing the team for the World Cup in 2015. Rick has coached a record 10 grand final wins with team Lebanon.\n\nRick is currently head coach of the 2014 Pakistan Shaheens, who will compete in this year's 2014 AFL International Cup. \n\nRick is currently looking at expanding the game in Lebanon once again and is working behind the scenes in an attempt to set up a Team Lebanon sporting academy.\n\nTeam Lebanon were the inaugural winners of the 2015 AFI World Cup, this bringing the total cups won to 10 now and rick being the most successful AFL Coach/President in the history of international teams.\n\nIn 2018, the inaugural Mediterranean Cup Team Lebanon came from behind to record an outstanding win.\n  \nas of now 2020 Rick decided to hand coaching reins over to Mohamad Kaakour who together with Rick as President brought home the inaugural ALL NATIONS CUP by being the underdog in the tournament and defeating favorite ITALY. \n\nsome great players have worn the team Lebanon jumper and a team of teams will be announced at a dinner in upcoming times.\n\nOman\nA group of players from Oman appeared at the 2007 Dubai 9s.  The Dubai Dingos followed the Dubai 9s by scheduling a match against the Omani side, which was partly composed of Gaelic football converts.  In 2008, the Muscat Magpies were formed as the country's first formal club.  The Magpies compete in the upcoming AFL Middle East.\n\nQatar\nAn Australian rules football club nicknamed the Kangaroos was founded in Doha, Qatar in early 2007, with their first appearance being at that year's Dubai 9s tournament. The Squad is made up of expatriate Australians.\n\nThe Doha Kangaroos were a founding member of the AFL Middle East.\n\nUnited Arab Emirates\nAustralian Rules in the United Arab Emirates has been played since 2006, with the creation of a club in Dubai known as the Dubai Dingoes.  In addition to the senior team, there is junior football held weekly.  The club is mainly composed of expatriate Australians as well as Irish from the local gaelic football club.  The Dingoes held a 9-a-side international tournament in early 2007, also featuring teams from Abu Dhabi, Oman and Qatar.\n\nA second and more successful club called the Dubai Heat was created as of 2007.\n\nA team mainly drawn from the Dubai Heat, but also with some players from the Dubai Dingoes, represented the UAE at the 2007 Asian Australian Football Championships. In 2008 Dubai Heat entered another team in the Asian championships and successfully took the title beating the Singapore Wombats.\n\nIn February 2008, the first AFL match in the United Arab Emirates was held at the Ghantoot Polo and Racing Club in Abu Dhabi between the Adelaide Crows and the Collingwood Magpies.  It was one of few official NAB Cup matches played outside of Australia and the game attracted a sell-out crowd of 6,102 using a makeshift field and grandstand and was televised free-to-air in Australia.

The game, also known as footy or Aussie rules, is a popular sport in Australia with a professional league called the Australian Football League (AFL). The game is played with a distinctive oval-shaped ball, and the objective is to score points by kicking or handballing the ball through a set of goalposts. The first recorded match of Australian rules football played in the Middle East was in 1997, when a group of Australian expatriates living in Dubai got together to start a team. The Dubai Heat played local games against other expatriate teams in the region and even participated in a tournament in Singapore. Since then, Australian rules football has steadily grown in popularity in the Middle East, particularly in countries such as the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, and Bahrain. In 2011, the AFL Middle East was formed, which serves as the governing body for Australian rules football in the region. The league comprises teams from several Middle Eastern countries, including the Dubai Dragons, Doha Kangaroos, Abu Dhabi Falcons, and Bahrain Blues. The AFL Middle East organizes an annual championship tournament called the AFL Middle East Premiership, which is composed of several rounds of matches between the member teams. In addition to the Premiership, the league also hosts several other events throughout the year, such as the Dubai 9s tournament and the Qatar Cup. Apart from expatriate communities, Australian rules football is also gaining popularity among local Middle Eastern youth who are drawn to the sport's fast-paced and dynamic gameplay. The AFL Middle East has launched several grassroots development programs aimed at introducing the sport to young people in the region. In conclusion, Australian rules football has become a promising sport in the Middle East. The sport has come a long way since its inception in the region, and the efforts of the AFL Middle East in expanding its reach and popularity bode well for the future of the game in the region.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 11812887}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Otto Strasser\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Otto Johann Maximilian Strasser (also , see \u00df; 10 September 1897 \u2013 27 August 1974) was a German politician and an early member of the Nazi Party. Otto Strasser, together with his brother Gregor Strasser, was a leading member of the party's left-wing faction, and broke from the party due to disputes with the dominant Hitlerite faction. He formed the Black Front, a group intended to split the Nazi Party and take it from the grasp of Hitler. This group also functioned during his exile and World War II as a secret opposition group.\n\nHis brand of Nazism is now known as Strasserism.\n\nCareer \n\nBorn at Bad Windsheim in the Kingdom of Bavaria, Otto Strasser took an active part in World War I (1914-1918). On 2 August 1914 he joined the Bavarian Army as a volunteer. He rose through the ranks to lieutenant and was twice wounded. He returned to Germany in 1919, where he served in the Freikorps that in May 1919 put down the Bavarian Soviet Republic, which was organized on the principles of workers' councils. About this time he joined the Social Democratic Party. In 1920 he participated in the opposition to the Kapp Putsch, but he grew increasingly alienated with his party's reformist stance, particularly when it put down a workers' uprising in the Ruhr, and he left the party later that year. In 1925 he joined the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP), in which his brother Gregor had been a member for several years, and worked for its newspaper as a journalist, ultimately taking it over with his brother. He focused particularly on the socialist elements of the  party's program and led the party's left faction in northern Germany together with his brother and Joseph Goebbels. His faction advocated support for  strikes, nationalization of banks and industry, and \u2013 despite acknowledged differences \u2013 closer ties with the Soviet Union. Hitler opposed some of these policies, judging them too radical and too alienating from parts of the German people (middle class and Nazi-supporting nationalist industrialists in particular), and the Strasser faction suffered defeat at the Bamberg Conference (1926), with Joseph Goebbels joining Hitler. Humiliated, Otto Strasser nonetheless, along with Gregor, continued as a leading Left Nazi within the party until Hitler expelled him from the NSDAP in 1930.\n\nAfter expulsion\nFollowing his expulsion, he set up his own party, the Black Front, composed of like-minded former NSDAP members, in an attempt to split the Nazi Party. His party proved unable to counter Hitler's rise to power in 1933, and Strasser spent the years of the Nazi era in exile. The Nazi Left itself was annihilated during the Night of the Long Knives in 1934 \u2013 in which his brother Gregor Strasser was killed \u2013 leaving Hitler as undisputed party leader and able to pacify both industrialists and the military into accepting his new Nazi regime. In addition to the Black Front, Strasser at this time headed the  Free German Movement outside Germany; this group (founded in 1941) sought to enlist the aid of Germans throughout the world in bringing about the downfall of Hitler and his vision of Nazism.\n\nExile\nStrasser fled first to Austria, then to Czechoslovakia (Prague), Switzerland, and France. In 1940 he went to Bermuda by way of Portugal, leaving a wife and two children behind in Switzerland. In 1941 he emigrated to Canada, where he became the famed \"Prisoner of Ottawa\". During this time, Goebbels denounced Strasser as the Nazis' \"Public Enemy Number One\" and a price of $500,000 was set on his head. He settled for a time in Montreal. In 1942, he lived for a time in  Clarence, Nova Scotia, on a farm owned by a German-speaking Czech, Adolph Schmidt, then moved to nearby  Paradise, where he lived for more than a decade in a rented apartment above a general store. As an influential and uncondemned former Nazi Party member still faithful to many doctrines of Nazism, he was initially prevented from returning to West Germany after the war, first by the  Allied powers and then by the  West German government.\n\nDuring his exile, he wrote articles on Nazi Germany and its leadership for several British, American, and Canadian newspapers, including the New Statesman, and a series for the Montreal Gazette, which was ghostwritten by then-Gazette reporter and later politician Donald C. MacDonald.\n\nReturn to Germany and death\nIn 1950 East Germany invited Strasser to become a member of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, but he declined, hoping that he would be permitted to return to Bavaria, which had been under US occupation until 1949. In his view, West Germany constituted an American colony and East Germany a Russian colony. He eventually gained West German citizenship and settled in Munich.\n\nHe attempted to create a new \"nationalist and socialist\"-oriented party in 1956, the German Social Union (often called a successor to the 1949\u20131952, eventually forbidden Socialist Reich Party of Germany), but his organization was unable to attract any support. For the rest of his life, Strasser continued to advocate for  Strasserite Neo-Nazism until he died in Munich in 1974.\n\nOtto Strasser claimed he was a dissenting Nazi regarding racial policies. Throughout his life, he claimed to have actively opposed such policies within the Nazi movement, for example, by organizing the removal of Julius Streicher from the German V\u00f6lkisch Freedom Party.\n\nWritten works\n Hitler and I (translated by Eric Mosbacher and Gwenda David) [Hitler und Ich.

During his time in the Nazi Party, Strasser was known for his leftist views and political vision. He advocated for greater worker protections and greater state control over industries, as well as a more aggressive foreign policy. He was instrumental in shaping the Nazi party's early propaganda efforts and was a key editor of the party newspaper, the V\u00f6lkischer Beobachter. However, as the Nazi Party gained power in Germany, Strasser grew disillusioned with Hitler's leadership and began to voice his criticisms and concerns. He was eventually expelled from the party in 1930 over his opposition to Hitler's purges of leftist members. Strasser went on to form his own political party, the Black Front, which espoused a populist and anti-capitalist agenda. During World War II, Strasser lived in exile in Czechoslovakia and later Canada, where he continued to voice his opposition to both the Nazi regime and the Allied powers. After the war, he returned to Germany but remained politically active and publicly critical of the rise of neo-Nazism in the country.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The 2020 presidential campaign of Joe Biden began on April 25, 2019, when former vice president Joe Biden released a video announcing his candidacy in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, and concluded with him and his running mate Kamala Harris defeating incumbent president Donald Trump and vice president Mike Pence in the general election. Biden, the vice president of the United States from 2009 to 2017 and a former U.S. senator from Delaware, had been the subject of widespread speculation as a potential 2020 candidate after declining to be a candidate in the 2016 election, which saw Donald Trump winning over Hillary Clinton, who was supported by Biden.\n\nBiden is generally described as a moderate, although he has recently described himself as progressive. His positions include codifying Roe v. Wade into statute, a public option for health insurance, decriminalization of recreational cannabis, passing the Equality Act, free community college, and a $1.7 trillion climate plan embracing the framework of the Green New Deal. He supports regulation, as opposed to a complete ban, on fracking.\n\nAs a former vice president and longtime United States senator, Biden entered the race with very high name recognition. From his campaign announcement up to the start of the elections, he was generally regarded as the Democratic front-runner. He led most national polls through 2019, but did not rank as one of the top three candidates in either the Iowa caucuses or the New Hampshire primary. At that point, some Democrats wondered if Biden's campaign was headed toward its demise. However, on February 29, 2020, he won a landslide victory in the 2020 South Carolina Democratic primary which reinvigorated his campaign. In March 2020, ten of his former competitors endorsed Biden, bringing the total number of such endorsements to 12. Biden earned enough delegates on Super Tuesday 2020 to pull ahead of Senator Bernie Sanders. On April 8, after Sanders suspended his campaign, Biden became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nIn June, Biden reached the required number of delegates to become the nominee. On August 11, Biden announced that Senator Kamala Harris would be his vice presidential running mate. On August 18 and 19, Biden and Harris were officially nominated at the 2020 Democratic National Convention, making Harris the first Asian American and the first female African American to be nominated for vice president on a major party ticket. National opinion polls conducted in 2020 generally showed Biden leading Trump in favorability. On November 7, four days after Election Day, Biden was projected to have defeated Trump, becoming president-elect of the United States. Biden and Harris were sworn in on January 20, 2021.\n\nBackground\n\nPrevious presidential campaigns\n\nBiden's 2020 presidential campaign was his third attempt to seek election for president of the United States. His first campaign was made in the 1988 Democratic Party primaries where he was initially considered one of the potentially strongest candidates. However, newspapers revealed plagiarism by Biden in law school records and in speeches, a scandal which led to his withdrawal from the race in September 1987.\n\nHe made the second attempt during the 2008 Democratic Party primaries, where he focused on his plan to achieve political success in the Iraq War through a system of federalization. Like his first presidential bid, Biden failed to garner endorsements and support. He withdrew from the race after his poor performance in the Iowa caucus on January 3, 2008. He was eventually chosen by Barack Obama as his running mate and won the general election as vice president of the United States, being sworn in on January 20, 2009.\n\nSpeculation\nVice President Joe Biden was seen as a potential candidate to succeed Barack Obama in the 2016 presidential election. On October 21, 2015, following the death of his son Beau, Biden announced that he would not seek the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016.\n\nDuring a tour of the U.S. Senate with reporters on December 5, 2016, Biden refused to rule out a potential bid for the presidency in the 2020 presidential election. He reasserted his ambivalence about running on an appearance of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on December 7, in which he stated \"never say never\" about running for president in 2020, while also admitting he did not see a scenario in which he would run for office again. He seemingly announced on January 13, 2017, exactly one week prior to the expiration of his vice presidential term, that he would not run. However, four days later, he seemed to backtrack, stating \"I'll run if I can walk.\" In September 2017, Biden's daughter Ashley indicated her belief that he was thinking about running in 2020.\n\nTime for Biden\n\nTime for Biden, a political action committee, was formed in January 2018, seeking Biden's entry into the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries.\n\nThe organization was criticized by some, who felt it was created too early and that Democratic effort should be spent on the 2018 midterm elections. The ''Time for Biden'' was also criticized as many thought that Biden was too old, and wanted more young progressive candidates going into the primary cycle.\n\nConsidering his options\nIn February 2018, Biden informed a group of longtime foreign policy aides that he was \"keeping his 2020 options open\".\n\nIn March 2018, Politico reported that Biden's team was considering a number of options to distinguish their campaign, such as announcing at the outset a younger vice presidential candidate from outside of politics, and also reported that Biden had rejected a proposition to commit to serving only one term as president. On July 17, 2018, he told a forum held in Bogota, Colombia, that he would decide if he would formally declare as a candidate by January 2019. On February 4, with no decision having been forthcoming from Biden, Edward-Isaac Dovere of The Atlantic wrote that Biden was \"very close to saying yes\" but that some close to him are worried he will have a last-minute change of heart, as he did in 2016. Dovere reported that Biden was concerned about the effect another presidential run could have on his family and reputation, as well as fundraising struggles and perceptions about his age and relative centrism compared to other declared and potential candidates. Conversely, his \"sense of duty\", offense at the Trump presidency, the lack of foreign policy experience among other Democratic hopefuls and his desire to foster \"bridge-building progressivism\" in the party were said to be factors prompting him to run.\n\nCampaign\n\nAnnouncement\n\nOn March 12, 2019, he told a gathering of his supporters he may need their energy \"in a few weeks\". Five days later, Biden accidentally revealed that he would be a candidate at a dinner in Dover, Delaware.\n\nOn April 19, 2019, The Atlantic reported that Biden planned to officially announce his campaign five days later via a video announcement, followed by a launch rally in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, or Charlottesville, Virginia. Charlottesville was the subject of Biden's kick-off campaign video due to its white supremacist riot in 2017. In the days before his expected launch, several major Democratic donors received requests to donate to his campaign committee, to be named \"Biden for President\". Subsequent reports indicated that Biden's plans remained uncertain, with no known launch date, locations for campaign rallies, or permits for an event in Philadelphia; associates continued to plan a fundraiser on April 25 in Philadelphia hosted by Comcast executive vice president David L. Cohen, but it was unclear whether the fundraiser would be held as planned, though his associates had continued to solicit donations in the days leading up to his announcement. On April 23, it was reported that Biden would formally enter the race two days later, so as to avoid overshadowing a forum focusing on women of color held the day before. The campaign reserved the Teamsters Local 249 union hall in Pittsburgh for April 29.\n\nOn May 22, the magazine Ebony reported that Biden had begun assembling his 2020 presidential campaign team, to be headquartered in Philadelphia. His team included campaign manager Greg Schultz and director of strategic communications Kamau Mandela Marshall, who both previously worked in the Obama administration, as well as other senior advisors from the Obama administration. Additionally, on May 31, the Biden campaign announced that Congressman Cedric Richmond would join the campaign as the national co-chairman.\n\nKey people \nSteve Ricchetti, campaign chairman\nMike Donilon, chief strategist\nGreg Schultz, 1st campaign manager\nJen O'Malley Dillon, 2nd campaign manager\nAnita Dunn, senior advisor\nSymone Sanders, senior advisor\nRon Klain, former Chief of Staff to the Vice President, senior advisor\nValerie Biden Owens, sister of Joe Biden, senior advisor\n\nEconomic policy \nJeffrey Zients, former Director of the National Economic Council\nJared Bernstein, Former Chief Economics Advisor to Joe Biden\nHeather Boushey, economist\nBen Harris, former Chief Economist and Chief Economic Advisor to Vice President Joe Biden\n\nFundraising and strategy\n\nOn April 26, 2019, Biden's campaign announced that they had raised $6.3 million in the first 24 hours, surpassing all other candidates' first 24-hour fundraising totals for the Democratic presidential nomination at that time. Biden's fundraising came from 128,000 unique contributors, equivalent to that of Beto O'Rourke's campaign, but about 40% lower than that of Bernie Sanders, who had 223,000 unique contributors in the first 24 hours of his campaign.\n\nAccording to a Politico article, the Biden campaign was operating on the premise that the Democratic base is not nearly as liberal or youthful as perceived. Privately, several Biden advisers acknowledged that their theory was based on polling data and voting trends, contending that the media is pushing the idea of a hyper-progressive Democratic electorate being propagated by a Twitter bubble and being out of touch with the average rank-and-file Democrat. In April 2019, Biden told reporters, \"The fact of the matter is the vast majority of the members of the Democratic Party are still basically liberal to moderate Democrats in the traditional sense.\" Biden also described himself as an \"Obama-Biden Democrat\". An unspecified Biden adviser said, \"There's a big disconnect between the media narrative and what the primary electorate looks like and thinks, versus the media narrative and the Twitter narrative [and] the Democratic primary universe is far less liberal. It's older than you think it is.\" From April 25 to May 25, 2019, Biden's campaign spent 83% of his total $1.2   million Facebook ad funding on targeting voters 45 years and older. No other top 2020 Democratic candidate has pursued a similar strategy in the primary.\n\nBiden, along with Bernie Sanders, was often perceived as the candidate with the best chance of defeating Donald Trump in the general election. According to The Washington Post, this may be because of his more moderate policies, or it may be because voters or party leaders believe a white male candidate is more \"electable\". Joe Biden said that his late son Beau should be running instead of him if he were alive. Biden led most national polls through 2019.  The Biden campaign came to rely on volunteer groups such as the Biden Digital Coalition for their social media presence and for tracking disinformation. \n\nThe campaign raised $70 million during the 2020 Democratic National Convention. The campaign and DNC combined raised a record $365 million in August 2020, compared to $154 million by Trump and the RNC. Biden raised another $383 million in September 2020, breaking his own record from the previous month.\n\nEarly primary election results \n\nDuring the Iowa caucuses held on February 3, 2020, Biden came in fourth place, earning six pledged delegates. In the New Hampshire primary held on February 11, Biden came in fifth place and did not earn any delegates due to his failure to meet the required 15% eligibility threshold. After poor showings in Iowa and New Hampshire, some media outlets questioned whether Biden's status as the most electable candidate was accurate.\n\nBiden won the South Carolina primary election held on February 29. Biden won all 46 counties in the state, winning 48.7% of the popular vote and earning 39 delegates. The win was largely attributed to his support from 61% of African-American voters (African-American voters make up approximately 60% of the Democratic electorate in South Carolina). Before the primary on February 26, Jim Clyburn endorsed Biden. Many cited Clyburn's endorsement as a reason for Biden's wide margin of victory, as Clyburn's endorsement is a deciding factor for many African American voters in South Carolina. Thirty-six percent of all primary voters said that they made their decision after Clyburn's endorsement; of that total, 70% voted for Biden. According to FiveThirtyEight, the outcome significantly boosted Biden's chance of winning multiple Super Tuesday states (especially southern states like North Carolina, Texas, and Virginia).\n\nIn early March, shortly before Super Tuesday, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar dropped out of the race and endorsed Biden, widely perceived as attempts to slow down Sanders' momentum in the primaries. Beto O'Rourke, Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, who had all suspended their campaign months before, also endorsed Biden at around the same time. On the Super Tuesday primary elections on March 3, Biden won Alabama, Arkansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia, earning a total of 458 delegates, and pulling ahead of Bernie Sanders in the race. According to an exit poll, Biden received a substantial amount of support from voters who made up their minds in the last few days before the election. Late voters also preferred a candidate who they believed could defeat Trump more than one who agreed with them on issues.\n\nOn March 9, CNN reported that Biden had a double-digit lead over Sanders in a nationwide poll. On March 12, with the coronavirus pandemic looming, Biden changed campaign managers, replacing Greg Schultz with Jen O'Malley Dillon.  In mid-March, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, many of the scheduled primaries were postponed. Aides to both Biden's and Sanders's campaigns were in contact regarding the pandemic and its effects.\n\nNomination\nLeading up to the 11th Democratic presidential debate, Biden announced two new progressive policies: making public colleges and universities tuition-free for students of families whose income is less than $125,000, and allowing for student loan debts to default during bankruptcy. The debate was held on March 15, 2020, and was the first to feature only the race's two lead finalists. Biden announced that if he secured the nomination, he would choose a female running mate, having previously hinted as much by naming several contenders. On April 3, Biden announced that his campaign would unveil a committee to vet prospective vice presidential candidates later in the month.\n\nOn March 15, Jen O'Malley Dillon was announced as the new campaign manager.\n\nOn March 25, when asked whether he would debate Sanders again, Biden said, \"My focus is just dealing with this crisis right now. I haven't thought about any more debates. I think we've had enough debates. I think we should get on with this.\" On April 8, after Sanders suspended his campaign, Biden became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. The next day, a former Senate staffer made a sexual assault allegation against Biden, which his campaign denied. On May 1, Biden stated that the allegation was false and requested that the secretary of the Senate work with the National Archives and Records Administration to identify and release any relevant documents. The Senate denied this request, saying personnel files are \"strictly confidential\". Two weeks later, Biden stated that he does not remember his accuser at all.\n\nBiden-Sanders Unity Task Forces\nSanders eventually dropped out of the race and endorsed Biden for president on April 13, and the two formed a series of task forces. These task forces aim to bridge the divide between the right wing of the Democratic party, represented by Biden, and the left wing of the party, represented by Sanders.\n\nOn May 13, Biden and Sanders announced that the six task forces would be co-chaired by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, former Secretary of State John Kerry, Rep. Pramila Jayapal, former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, NILC director Marielena Hincapi\u00e9, Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, AFA president Sara Nelson, Rep. Karen Bass, civil rights attorney Chiraag Bains, Rep. Bobby Scott, Dr. Heather Gautney, and Rep. Marcia Fudge.\n\nSix task forces were formed, each with members representing each candidate, covering climate change, criminal justice reform, the economy, education, health care, and immigration. The final report was released on July 8, 2020, and is expected to form the basis of the 2020 Democratic presidential platform. The six groups were coordinated by Analilia Mejia, political director to the Sanders primary campaign, and Carmel Martin, an advisor to Biden.\n\n(Italics denotes the Chair of a committee)\n\nUnity Task Force on Climate Change\n John Kerry\n Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\n Kathy Castor \n Kerry Duggan \n Catherine Coleman Flowers \n Conor Lamb \n Gina McCarthy \n Donald McEachin \n Varshini Prakash\n\nUnity Task Force on Criminal Justice Reform\n Chiraag Bains \n Bobby Scott\n Raumesh Akbari\n Justin Bamberg \n Vanita Gupta \n Eric Holder\n Symone Sanders \n Stacey Walker\n\nUnity Task Force on the Economy\n Karen Bass \n Sara Nelson\n Jared Bernstein \n Darrick Hamilton \n Ben Harris \n Stephanie Kelton \n Lee Saunders \n Sonal Shah\n\nUnity Task Force on Education\n Marcia Fudge\n Heather Gautney\n Alejandro Adler \n Lily Eskelsen Garcia \n Maggie Thompson \n Christie Vilsack \n Randi Weingarten \n Hirokazu Yoshikawa\n\nUnity Task Force on Health Care\n Pramila Jayapal \n Vivek Murthy \n Donald Berwick \n Abdul El-Sayed \n Sherry Glied \n Mary Kay Henry \n Chris Jennings\n Robin Kelly\n\nUnity Task Force on Immigration\n Lucille Roybal-Allard\n Marielena Hincapi\u00e9 \n Crist\u00f3bal Alex \n Veronica Escobar \n Marisa Franco \n Juan Gonzalez \n Kate Marshall \n Javier Vald\u00e9s\n\nOutcomes of the task forces\nBy June 9, Biden had enough delegates to secure his nomination as the Democratic candidate. On July 8, Biden's campaign released a set of policy recommendations adopted by the Unity Task Forces appointed by him and Bernie Sanders. The recommendations focus on climate change, criminal justice, the economy, education, health care, and immigration.\n\nKanye West\nOn July 4, musician and entrepreneur Kanye West announced his campaign for the presidency. The Los Angeles Times wrote that this \"might be part of an effort to draw Black supporters away from Biden to help Trump.\"\n\nAccepting the nomination\n\nOn August 5, it was reported that Biden would accept the Democratic nomination from his home state of Delaware due to the pandemic. On August 11, he announced that Kamala Harris would be his running mate. The next day, the two made their first public appearance together promoting their mutual campaigns. On August 18, the second night of the 2020 Democratic National Convention, the party officially nominated Biden, making him the first non-incumbent vice president to be nominated for president since Walter Mondale in 1984. Biden accepted the nomination two nights later. Chris Wallace of Fox News Sunday called Biden's acceptance speech \"enormously effective\" and said he \"blew a big hole\" in Trump's characterization of the candidate as being \"mentally shot.\" During the convention, delegates adopted the party platform, which was drafted by a committee of many of the same people from the unity task forces and based on the recommendations issued by those task forces.\n\nPresidential debates\n\nSince Biden's successful nomination in the Democratic primaries Trump attempted to cast doubt over Biden's abilities, claiming that he was suffering from dementia and that he was taking performance-enhancing drugs in the primaries. Trump called for Biden to be drug tested before the presidential debate; Biden declined. Trump also claimed that Biden would use a hidden electronic earpiece for the debate, demanding that Biden's ears be searched. Again, Biden declined.\n\nThe first debate took place at Cleveland Clinic on September 29. It was moderated by Chris Wallace. Debate topics included Trump's and Biden's records, the economy, the COVID-19 pandemic, race relations, and the Supreme Court nomination of Amy Coney Barrett. Each speaker was to have two minutes to state their positions followed with a period of discussion. The debate quickly devolved into cross talk and interruptions and was widely criticized as being a low point in U.S. presidential politics. Although Wallace pleaded multiple times with Trump to follow the agreed-upon debate rules, Trump frequently interrupted and spoke over Biden and at times with Wallace as well. Following the debate Wallace stated that while his own family and the Biden family wore masks as had been required for those in attendance, the Trump family did not and refused the masks offered to them by Cleveland Clinic staffers.\n\nThe vice presidential debate between Harris and Pence took place as scheduled on October 7 with Susan Page serving as moderator. The debate was generally seen as civil although there were frequent instances of both candidates interrupting while the other was speaking, with Harris interrupting only about half as often as Pence. Pence also repeatedly spoke beyond his allotted time, ignoring Page's attempts of asking him to mind the two-minute time limits. A CNN poll of registered voters found that 59% felt Harris had won, while 38% felt Pence to be the winner.\n\nThe second debate was scheduled to take place on October 15, but was cancelled in light of the White House COVID-19 outbreak and Trump's declared intention not to participate in a virtual debate. In response to Trump's refusal to debate Biden scheduled a town hall on ABC for October 15; Trump then scheduled a town hall as well, on the same date and at the same time, to be broadcast on NBC, MSNBC, and CNBC. According to Nielsen ratings, nearly 700,000 more viewers watched Biden's town hall than those who watched Trump's, even though Trump appeared on three outlets.\n\nThe final debate took place on Thursday, October 22, 2020, from 9:00\u00a0p.m. to 10:30\u00a0p.m. EDT, at the Curb Event Center in Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee, with Kristen Welker of NBC moderating. While it was originally planned to be the third debate, it was the second due to the cancellation of the October 15 debate. The topics covered included: fighting the current COVID-19 pandemic, American families, racial issues, climate change, national security, and leadership. The debate rules were similar to the first, but due to President Trump's repeated interruptions in the prior debate, each candidates microphones would be muted when it was not their turn to talk. This debate was considered to be drastically less hostile and much more informative, but both candidates still made several false or misleading claims. A post-debate CNN/SSRS poll found that 53% of debate-viewers thought that Biden had won and 39% thought Trump had won, with a margin of error of 5.7 points.\n\nFinal month \nOn October 6, Biden made a campaign speech in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, called \"the best of his campaign\" by CNN's John Avlon.\n\nOn October 15, both Biden and Trump held separate town hall speeches, replacing the cancelled second debate.\n\nOn October 22, Biden and Trump participated in a second and final debate in Nashville, Tennessee. In contrast to the first debate, the microphones of both candidates were muted at select times. Trump pressed Biden on renewed allegations that during his time as vice president, members of his family had personally profited from his position in Ukraine and China; Biden denied any misconduct and pointed out controversies involving Trump and those countries. Trump repeatedly asked why Biden had not delivered on his 2020 campaign promises during his eight years in the White House, to which Biden responded, \"we had a Republican Congress.\"\n\nTexas bus incident \nOn October 31, 2020, a Joe Biden campaign bus was harassed by several drivers while traveling from San Antonio to Austin, Texas along Interstate 35. The bus, which carried former State Senator Wendy Davis and several campaign staffers, was followed along the interstate by several cars, including many flying Donald Trump flags. After the incident, the Biden campaign cancelled two planned events in Austin, Texas.\n \nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) launched an investigation into the incident. Trump subsequently criticized the FBI's decision at a rally. He later tweeted, \"In my opinion, these patriots did nothing wrong. Instead, the FBI & Justice should be investigating the terrorists, anarchists, and agitators of ANTIFA, who run around burning down our Democrat run cities and hurting our people!\"\n\nElection Day and beyond \n\nThe election was held on November 3. On November 6, election-calling organization Decision Desk HQ forecast that Biden had won the election based on its forecast that Biden had won Pennsylvania; this result coupled with Biden's other projected state wins would grant him over 270 electoral college votes.\n\nBy November 7, news organizations ABC News, Associated Press, CBS News, CNN, Fox News, NBC News, Reuters, and the New York Times all forecast that Biden had won the election.\n\nAs of December 27, Joe Biden has received 81,283,098 votes to Donald Trump's 74,222,958 votes, or 51.3% to 46.8%. In addition, Biden has won 306 electoral college votes to Trump's 232, exactly the same margins as the 2016 election, which Donald Trump had repeatedly called a \"landslide victory\". Biden broke the record for most votes cast during an election in the history of the United States, while Trump received the most votes ever for a sitting president.\n\nOn December 9, every state had certified their election results, with West Virginia being the last state to do so. On Monday December 14, the Electoral College voted to elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris President and Vice President-Elect, affirming what was projected to happen on November 6 and 7. After a chaotic attack on the Capitol, lawmakers met on January 6 and counted the electoral votes submitted by the states, finally ensuring that Joe Biden would take office on January 20.\n\nDuring and after the election, Donald Trump and his allies have repeatedly claimed that there was significant fraud in this election, often with little or no evidence. Because of this, Trump and his lawyers have called for swing state officials to overturn the results, frequently drawing criticism for their inflammatory and violent remarks. He has filed more than 50 lawsuits challenging the results in several different swing states, but almost all have been lost. Notably, a major lawsuit challenging the vote in 6 different swing states was unanimously rejected by the conservative majority Supreme Court. In a last ditch attempt at overturning the election, several Republican members of the House and Senate objected to the January 6 certification of the Electoral College, but after a long night of deliberation, Mike Pence certified the results for Joe Biden, much to the ire of Donald Trump. That same day, a violent group of Trump supporters broke into the United States Capitol while Congress was counting the votes in an attempt to halt or slow the proceedings. They were not successful in stopping the count, though they did manage to delay the certification by a few hours.\n\nPolling\n\nOpinion polls conducted in 2020 generally showed Biden leading Trump nationally in general election matchups, with the former vice president's advantage often extending beyond that of the survey's margin of sampling error.\n\nOn July 4, Politico reported that Biden was leading Trump \"by double digits in recent polls\". In late July, a Washington Post\u2013ABC News poll showed Biden's double-digit lead holding. A national poll conducted in early August showed Biden leading by three percent. An Iowa poll showed Trump leading Biden by 48% to 45%, which is six percentage points less than Trump won the state with in 2016.\n\nThree national polls released August 13\u201317 show Biden polling ahead of Trump: Fox News has him leading Trump 49%\u201342%, NBC/Wall Street Journal has him leading 50%\u201341%, and Washington Post/ABC News has him 53%\u201341%. A Pew Research Center showed similar results, but found that a majority of participants believed that Trump would win. A Washington Post/ABC News poll taken in late September showed Biden and Harris's lead to be 53%\u201343%.\n\nA NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll conducted September 30 \u2013 October 1 (after the presidential debate, but before Trump's announcement of his COVID-19 diagnosis) has Biden leading 53%\u201339%. On October 7, a CNN poll showed Biden leading 57%\u201341%, and a week later, Opinium Research/The Guardian showed him leading 57%\u201340%. As of October 13, Biden consistently led in poll averages by several or more points for over 100 days, as compared to the last four presidential elections. Biden led 54%\u201342% in a CNN poll of October 28; its polling director pointed out that:Although the election will ultimately be decided by the statewide results, which drive the Electoral College, Biden's lead nationally is wider than any presidential candidate has held in more than two decades in the final days of the campaign.\n\nOdds of winning \nIn late September, FiveThirtyEight put Biden's odds of winning at nearly 77% and specifically predicted that he would win 352 electoral votes. His popularity rose in early October and, by October 13, FiveThirtyEight had increased its odds of Biden winning the election to 87%. This calculation remained the same through October 26, when it began to rise again, reaching 90% on October 30.\n\nAllegations of inappropriate physical contact \nBiden has been accused several times of inappropriate non-sexual contact, such as embracing, kissing, and other forms of physical contact. He has described himself as a \"tactile politician\" and admitted this behavior has caused trouble for him in the past. By 2015, a series of swearings-in and other events at which Biden had placed his hands on people and talked closely to them, attracted attention both in the press and on social media. Various people defended Biden, including a senator who issued a statement, as well as Stephanie Carter, a woman whose photograph with Biden had gone viral, who described the photo as \"misleadingly extracted from what was a longer moment between close friends\". In February 2016, Biden gave a speech about sexual assault awareness at the 88th Academy Awards, before introducing Lady Gaga.\n\nIn March 2019, former Nevada assemblywoman Lucy Flores alleged that Biden had touched her without her consent at a 2014 campaign rally in Las Vegas. In an op-ed, Flores wrote that Biden had walked up behind her, put his hands on her shoulders, smelled her hair, and kissed the back of her head, adding that the way he touched her was \"an intimate way reserved for close friends, family, or romantic partners\u2014and I felt powerless to do anything about it.\" Biden's spokesman said Biden did not recall the behavior described. Two days later, Amy Lappos, a former congressional aide to Jim Himes, said Biden touched her in a non-sexual but inappropriate way by holding her head to rub noses with her at a political fundraiser in Greenwich in 2009. The next day, two more women came forward with allegations of unwanted touching claiming that he touched a woman's leg during a meeting, and that he placed his hand on a woman's back during a photo.\n\nIn early April 2019, three women told The Washington Post Biden had touched them in ways that made them feel uncomfortable. Also in April 2019, former Biden staffer Tara Reade said she had felt uncomfortable on several occasions when Biden touched her on her shoulder and neck during her employment in his Senate office in 1993. In March 2020, Reade accused him of a 1993 sexual assault. There were inconsistences between Reade's 2019 and 2020 allegations. Biden and his campaign vehemently denied the allegation. The New York Times investigated and \"found no pattern of sexual misconduct by Mr. Biden\".\n\nBiden apologized for not understanding how people would react to his actions, but said his intentions were honorable and that he would be more \"mindful of people's personal space\". He went on to say he was not sorry for anything he had ever done, which led critics to accuse him of sending a mixed message. Arwa Mahdawi of The Guardian said it was \"frustrating to see conservatives... weaponize the accusations against Biden\", but that it was \"also frustrating to see so many liberals turn a blind eye\".\n\nEndorsements\n\nAs tracked by FiveThirtyEight, Biden received the most support from prominent members of the Democratic Party out of all Democratic candidates in the 2020 presidential election after many settled for Biden, Bernie popularity was dropping in the polls, and many wanted Joe Biden rather than Bernie Sanders. Biden received endorsements from 12 former candidates in the 2020 race, including Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, Michael Bloomberg, Tulsi Gabbard, Amy Klobuchar, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Beto O'Rourke, Andrew Yang, and others. On April 14, 2020, after Biden was the only remaining major candidate for the Democratic nomination, former president Barack Obama (under whom Biden served as vice president) endorsed him. On April 27, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi endorsed him. On April 28, Biden received the endorsement of former 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, whose election loss had inspired his 2020 candidacy.\n\nBiden increasingly attracted Republican support away from their party's incumbent leader, Donald Trump. On August 17, an ad from Republican Voters Against Trump aired featuring Miles Taylor, former chief of staff to former homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. Taylor concludes in the ad, \"Given what I experienced in the [Trump] administration, I have to support Joe Biden for president.\" In late August, a movement called Republicans for Biden was launched with sponsorship by 25 former Republican congresspeople, and Politico reported that \"Several dozen former staffers from Sen. Mitt Romney's (R-Utah) presidential campaign, the George W. Bush administration and the campaign and Senate staff of former Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) have signed on to an effort to elect Joe Biden.\" By early September, over 175 current and former law enforcement officials had endorsed Biden.\n\nIn September 2020, Scientific American announced its endorsement of Biden for president. This was the first time the magazine had endorsed a presidential candidate in the almost 200 years that it has been in print. The magazine's endorsement read:\n\nThe evidence and the science show that Donald Trump has badly damaged the U.S. and its people\u2014because he rejects evidence and science. The most devastating example is his dishonest and inept response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which cost more than 190,000 Americans their lives by the middle of September. He has also attacked environmental protections, medical care, and the researchers and public science agencies that help this country prepare for its greatest challenges. That is why we urge you to vote for Joe Biden, who is offering fact-based plans to protect our health, our economy and the environment. These and other proposals he has put forth can set the country back on course for a safer, more prosperous and more equitable future.\n\nIn October, the New England Journal of Medicine, the oldest and considered to be the world's most prestigious medical journal, published an editorial which condemned the Trump administration's handling of the coronavirus pandemic saying that \"they have taken a crisis and turned it into a tragedy.\" This is the first time in the journal's history that they have supported or condemned a political candidate. A week later, the science journal Nature also endorsed Biden.\n\nIn October, 780 retired generals, admirals, senior noncommissioned officers, ambassadors and senior national security officials signed a letter endorsing Biden.\n\nOn October 25, the conservative-leaning New Hampshire Union Leader endorsed Biden, the first Democratic presidential candidate the paper had endorsed in over 100 years.\n\nPolitical positions\n\nAlthough generally referred to as a moderate, Biden has declared himself as the candidate with the most progressive record.\n\nAbortion\nOn May 21, 2019, a Biden campaign aide told the Associated Press that Biden would support immediate federal legislation codifying Roe v. Wade into statute. On June 5, 2019, the Biden campaign confirmed to NBC News that Biden still supports the Hyde Amendment, something no other Democratic presidential candidate came out in support of. Biden's campaign also told NBC News that Biden would be open to repealing the Hyde Amendment if abortion access protections currently under Roe v. Wade were threatened. On June 6, 2019, Biden, at the Democratic National Committee's African American Leadership Council Summit in Atlanta, Georgia, said he now supports repealing the Hyde Amendment, crediting his change in position, in part, to recent efforts by Republicans passing anti-abortion state laws, which he called \"extreme laws\". Also at the summit, he focused on economic inequality for African Americans, education access, criminal justice reform, healthcare, and voter suppression in the south.\n\nCannabis\nBiden supports the decriminalization, but not legalization, of recreational cannabis usage. Biden said he believes no one should be in jail because of cannabis use. As president, he would decriminalize cannabis use and automatically expunge prior convictions. He supports the legalization of cannabis for medical purposes, leaving decisions regarding legalization for recreational use up to the states, and recategorizing cannabis as a Schedule II drug so researchers can study its impacts. Every other Democratic presidential candidate supported the full federal legalization of cannabis, with the exception of Michael Bloomberg, Steve Bullock and Joe Sestak.\n\nCapital punishment\nOn June 20, 2019, following the first federal death sentence since 2003, Biden came out against capital punishment, supporting the repeal of both federal- and state-level death sentence statutes. He argued that with the death penalty, there is a risk of executing a wrongfully convicted person. Biden had previously supported capital punishment.\n\nEducation \nIn 2018, Biden said he supported a universal pre-kindergarten program. He unveiled a higher education plan in October 2019, which includes two years of guaranteed free community college or other training, and cuts to student loan obligations. Unlike some of his rivals, he initially did not support four years of free college tuition, but later reversed this for students of families whose income is less than $125,000, as well as allowing student loan debts to default during bankruptcy.\n\nAlthough the Obama administration promoted charter schools, Biden criticized some charter schools for funneling money away from public schools in a May 2019 speech, and said that he opposes federal funds for-profit charter schools.\n\nEnvironment\nOn June 4, 2019, the Biden campaign released a $1.7 trillion climate plan that embraced the framework of the Green New Deal. The plan called for the US to reach net zero emissions by 2050 or earlier, and help coal workers to transition into jobs created from a clean-energy economy. Biden supports the development of carbon capture and storage and small modular reactors to reduce emissions. On September 4, 2019, during a CNN climate change town hall, Biden said he does not support banning fracking for natural gas, distancing himself from some of his Democratic presidential rivals, but said he would ban new fracking permits and evaluate existing ones to determine their safety.\n\nHealth\nOn July 16, 2019, Biden called for additional funding to construct rural hospitals, increase telehealth services in rural communities, and provide incentives for doctors to practice in rural areas, also known as medical deserts in the United States.\n\nOn April 29, 2019, Biden came out in favor of a public option for health insurance and outlawing non-compete clauses for low-wage workers.\n\nImmigration\nOn July 5, 2019, Biden told CNN he did not support decriminalizing illegal entry into the United States, a position that puts him at odds with many of his 2020 Democratic rivals. He released a plan to reform the immigration system in December 2019, which includes a reversal of the Trump administration's deportation policies, a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, and expansions in work visas and refugee admissions.\n\nInfrastructure\nBiden released his infrastructure plan on November 14, 2019, calling for investments of $1.3 trillion on infrastructure overhaul. The plan involves investments in the restoration of roads, bridges and highways, encouraging greater adoption of rail transport and electric vehicles. It also includes water pipe replacements, increases in broadband coverage, and updates to schools.\n\nLGBTQ issues\nOn June 1, 2019, Biden gave a keynote address to hundreds of activists and donors at the Human Rights Campaign's annual Ohio gala. He declared his top legislative priority was passing the Equality Act. He attacked Donald Trump for banning transgender troops in the U.S. military, allowing individuals in the medical field to deny treating LGBTQ individuals, and allowing homeless shelters to deny transgender occupants.\n\nRace relations\nWhile at a fundraiser on June 18, 2019, Biden said one of his greatest strengths was \"bringing people together\" and pointed to his relationships with senators James Eastland and Herman Talmadge, two segregationists, as examples. While imitating a Southern drawl, Biden remarked \"I was in a caucus with James O. Eastland. He never called me 'boy', he always called me 'son'.\" Biden's Democratic opponents criticized the remarks, specifically the use of the word \"boy\". In response, Biden said that he was not meaning to use the term \"boy\" in its derogatory racial context.\n\nDuring the first Democratic presidential debate, Kamala Harris criticized Biden for his comments regarding his past work with segregationist senators and his past opposition to desegregation busing, which had allowed black children like her to attend integrated schools. Biden was widely criticized for his debate performance and support for him dropped 10 points. President Trump defended Biden, saying Harris was given \"too much credit\" for her debate with Biden.\n\nIn May 2020, during an interview on The Breakfast Club radio show that CBS News described as \"contentious\", Biden remarked \"If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black.\" He later apologized for his remarks.\n\nWelfare\nOn June 17, 2019, Biden appeared at the \"Poor People's Campaign Presidential Forum\" in Washington, D.C., to discuss proposals for the funding of poverty alleviation programs. At a fundraiser in New York the next day, While on the topic of raising wealthy donor's taxes to get his legislative goals passed, he reassured wealthy donors that he would not \"demonize\" the rich and said, \"no one's standard of living will change, nothing would fundamentally change.\"\n\nTrump\u2013Ukraine scandal\n\nIn 2019, Trump allegedly attempted to coerce Ukraine and other foreign countries to investigate Joe Biden's son Hunter. Trump enlisted surrogates within and outside his official administration, including his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr, to pressure Ukraine and other foreign governments to cooperate in supporting conspiracy theories concerning American politics. Trump blocked but later released payment of a congressionally mandated $391 million military aid package to allegedly obtain quid pro quo cooperation from Volodymyr Zelensky, the President of Ukraine. A number of contacts were established between the White House and the government of Ukraine, culminating in a phone call between Trump and Zelensky on July 25, 2019.\n\nThe scandal resulted in Trump's impeachment on charges of abusing the power of his office and obstructing Congress, and his ultimate acquittal by the Senate. At the time, no evidence had been produced of any wrongdoing by the Bidens.\n\nIn October 2019, CNN refused to run an ad for the Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign, saying it includes false claims against Biden. Fox News refused to stop airing a Trump campaign ad that allegedly lied about Biden after his campaign asked them to stop running the ad.\n\nOn October 14, 2020, the New York Post ran a story showing a screenshot of an alleged email from a top adviser to Ukrainian energy company Burisma to Biden's son Hunter, thanking him for the supposed opportunity to meet his father. The article alleges that this supports claims that Biden used his political power to benefit his son Hunter in business dealings with Ukraine. The Post's source was Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who says he got the data from the hard drive of a laptop allegedly dropped off at a repair shop in April 2019. The shop owner, John Mac Isaac, said he initially turned the laptop over to the FBI and later shared a copy of the data with Giuliani. CBS reported that they held a lengthy interview with Mac Isaac in which he frequently contradicted himself, \"raising questions about [his] truthfulness.\" Social media platforms swiftly responded by controlling how the article could be shared\u2014Facebook by including a fact-checking statement and Twitter by preventing links to the story on the basis of its containing hacked material. Republican politicians accused these platforms of censorship, renewing calls for reform of Section 230. Trump suggested that disclosures in the emails should disqualify Biden from the presidency. Biden's campaign and those associated with him portrayed the article's allegations as false, saying that no such meeting ever happened. Former U.S. intelligence officials warned the White House in 2019 that Giuliani could be the target of a Russian intelligence operation.\n\nUnited States intelligence community analysis released in March 2021 stated that proxies of Russian intelligence promoted and laundered misleading or unsubstantiated narratives about the Bidens \"to US media organizations, US officials, and prominent US individuals, including some close to former President Trump and his administration.\"\n\nA June 2021 PolitiFact fact-check stated that \"over time, there has been less doubt that the laptop did in fact belong to Hunter Biden\", although concluded that \"[n]othing from the laptop has revealed illegal or unethical behavior by Joe Biden as vice president with regard to his son\u2019s tenure as a director for Burisma\". In an opinion article, Holman W. Jenkins Jr. of The Wall Street Journal criticized other journalists regarding the laptop, for \"ignoring a story you know to be true in hopes your readers will believe it's not true\" Glenn Kessler of The Washington Post analyzed a claim, purportedly from emails of the laptop, that Joe Biden met with Burisma executive Vadym Pozharskyi at a dinner in April 2015. Kessler concluded that Joe Biden had briefly dropped by the dinner to speak to his longtime Greek friend, Alex Karloutsos, without participating in the dinner; additionally, while the attendees list included the name \"Vadym\", no last name was specified.\n\nReferences\nFootnotes\n\nCitations\n\nExternal links\n \n Official Biden-Harris transition website\n\n \npresidential campaign, 2020\nKamala Harris\nBiden, Joe\n2020 in women's history", "machine_text": "Joe Biden 2020 Presidential Campaign Joe Biden, the 47th Vice President of the United States, announced his candidacy for the 2020 Presidential elections on April 25, 2019.

Biden's campaign for the presidency is focused on uniting the country and restoring the soul of the nation. His platform includes addressing climate change, implementing gun safety measures, and protecting healthcare for all Americans. One of the main issues that Biden's campaign has focused on is the coronavirus pandemic. Biden has criticized President Trump for his handling of the pandemic and has vowed to implement a national plan to combat the virus if elected. He has also promised to provide relief to families and businesses affected by the pandemic. Another issue that Biden has focused on is the economy. He has promised to create millions of jobs through investments in clean energy, infrastructure, and education. He has also pledged to raise the minimum wage and provide relief to small businesses and workers impacted by the pandemic. Biden has also made racial justice and police reform a central part of his campaign. He has proposed increasing funding for community policing and implementing reforms to reduce police brutality and increase accountability. Throughout his campaign, Biden has emphasized the importance of character and decency in political leadership. He has criticized President Trump for his divisive rhetoric and promised to bring the country together if elected. Biden faced a crowded field of candidates during the Democratic primaries, but ultimately secured the nomination in August 2020. He selected Kamala Harris as his running mate, making her the first woman of color to be nominated for Vice President on a major party ticket. The 2020 Presidential election saw historic voter turnout, with Biden defeating incumbent President Trump with over 80 million votes and 306 electoral votes. Biden was inaugurated on January 20, 2021, becoming the oldest person to assume the presidency in US history.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 55026675}

He is known for winning a Primetime Emmy Award for animation on Comedy Central's Broad City television show. His pop culture artwork, collaborative projects and communal work are often outside the standard art gallery sensibility. He works in a variety of media including illustration, animation, painting, type, magazines, videos, public art, sculpture, and books.\n\nEarly life \n\nPerry grew up outside of Kansas City, Missouri. After getting into trouble as an early teen, he discovered drawing and painting when his grandfather, a painter, gave him a tackle box filled with oil paints.\n\nPerry graduated from the Minneapolis College of Art and Design in 2003 after changing his major from Art to Graphic Design. After he was rejected for an internship at the Walker Art Center, the museum's design director, Andrew Blauvelt, wrote a note suggesting he apply for a job at Urban Outfitters. Perry worked at the company's headquarters on digital media, publications, and catalog design for three years. He moved to Brooklyn in 2004 and in 2006 opened a studio.\n\nCareer \nMike Perry, a studio artist whose work is rooted in popular culture, \"is king\" of working in many mediums as an illustrator, typographer, sculptor, animator, painter, curator and producer. His fluorescent color, busy, organic and playful work looks \"like hand-drawn doodles,\" patterns and type.\n\nPerry's work from 2004 to 2011 was collected in the 2012 monograph for Rizzoli, Wondering Around Wandering. Excited about the publication and wanting to turn it into a bigger, communal and free event, he developed \"an unprecedented\" and \"unlikely\" three month long, pop-up community art space in a 7,000-square-foot warehouse in Crown Heights. Perry noted that his inspiration for the project, run by volunteers, came from the fact that \"he doesn\u2019t see a lot of support or room for work like his in the galleries and institutions of today\u2019s art world\"; Perry \"connected that attitude to an absence of more zine, print, and t-shirt shops \u2014 alternative spaces, essentially, that function so often as both communal and artistic (and commercial) loci.\" A Kickstarter campaign for the event raised $32,000 in a month. The community-centered space featured classes, workshops, performances and work by local artists. Seven hundred people came to the opening.\n\nHe has taught at Minneapolis College of Art and Design in Minneapolis, Maryland Institute College of Art in Baltimore, the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Parsons School of Design in New York City.  A featured speaker at conferences, Perry has been interviewed extensively about the issues of working as a freelance artist. Brand consulting work as creative director and designer includes projects for The New York Times, Dolby, Jameson, the Tonight Show, Facebook, Microsoft, Honda and Insound. His many designs for brands include sneakers for Nike and custom glassware for Duvel.\n\nExhibitions \n\nSince 2007, Perry has been in over forty group and solo exhibitions worldwide. Solo shows includeThe Landscape Between Time & Space in London in 2008, and The Patterns Found in Space in New York at Giant Robot in 2009. Lost in the Discovery of What Shapes the Mind, 2010, covering 2,800-square-feet, was the first solo alumnus show at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design. In 2011, We Are the Infinity of Each Other and Color, Shapes, and Infinity were exhibited in Tokyo. A nude series, My Mother Caught Me Doodling, was shown at London's KK Outlet in 2014. His 2016 Intoxicating Pollen Wiggling in a Moist Journey of Constantly Blooming Tides at Garis & Hahn in New York, featuring abstract paintings of nudes and still lifes, led to a show of the same name inaugurating the gallery's Los Angeles location in 2017.\n\nGroup shows include The Fine Line in 2010; Walker Art Center's 2011 traveling installation Posterwall for the 21st Century, on the role digital art has played in design; Wondering Around Wandering in 2012; sculpture at the Corning Museum of Glass' Making Ideas: Experiments in Design at Glass Lab in 2013; WOW (Writing on Walls) in Belgium in 2016; and A Fantastic World in 2018.\n\nPerry has created and curated a number of public art installations for arts organizations and companies. In Brooklyn in 2013 he had several projects: street art on a construction site; a playground mural at the school P.S. 705; and his Crown Heights mural, a push back on the gentrification of the neighborhood where Perry's studio is located. In 2014, he created a mural for a Chipotle restaurant in Los Angeles, and a mural in Breda, the Netherlands, featuring a poem by Frank Nicholas, and later in 2015, he made a mural and installation for Facebook in New York. In 2016, Perry made one of New York City's largest rooftop murals in Brooklyn at the workspace a/d/o, and in 2017 he completed a multifloor mural in Cleveland incorporating a Tyehimba Jess poem.  His mural Wiggling Waves & Water Wanders went up in 2019 at Pier 17 in New York.\n\nAnimation \nPerry became more widely known for animating the titles for all seasons of the Comedy Central show Broad City and for animating the Mushrooms episode animation. He initially turned down the offer to do the titles, his \"first real animation project.\" Show stars and creators Abbi Jacobson and Ilana Glazer described the Mushrooms episode as one of their favorites from the series\u2019 entire run. Jacobson said the titles were \u201csuch a big part of the identity of Broad City.\u201d  Mushrooms earned Perry and his team an Emmy Award for Outstanding Motion Design.\n\nBooks and Magazines \nIn collaboration with partner Anna Wolf, Perry started Untitled: (a fashion) Magazine in 2007, and in 2014, Tidal, a biannual print magazine focused on art and culture. His pop culture monographs include Pulled: A Catalog of Screen Printing and the career anthology Wondering Around Wandering: Work-So-Far. The collection My Mother Caught Me Doodling is from the show of the same name. What If My Dog Had Thumbs? is his first solo book for children.\n\nCuration \nSince 2011, Perry and artist Josh Cochran have been organizing a series of nude, two-day drawing marathons, #GetNudeGetDrawn, enlisting volunteers to model nude, initially organized using social media and Craigslist. The drawings are exhibited and sold at a pop-up exhibition immediately afterwards. Other past artist participants include Lisa Hanawalt, Deanne Cheuk, Jon Burgerman, Julia Rothman and Monica Ramos. In 2015, Perry created and curated an 820-foot-long mural with nine other artists, that was completed in one day.\n\nAwards and recognition \nPerry was chosen for Step Magazine's 30 under 30 in 2004, and named a groundbreaking illustrator by Computer Arts Projects Magazine in 2007.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"WXKY\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "WXKY (96.3 FM) is a radio station licensed to Stanford, Kentucky, which serves as an affiliate of the national K-LOVE Contemporary Christian radio network owned by the Educational Media Foundation. The station's transmitter is located in the far northeast corner of Casey County, west of Stanford and near Hustonville on Sand Knob Road.\n\nPrior to being leased out, and later sold, to EMF, WXKY was a Stanford-based country music station as WRSL-FM, an adjunct to WRSL (1520 AM).\n\nHistory\n\nWRSL-FM\nWhen WRSL-FM began operating on May 26, 1967, it was the first FM radio station in service between Lexington and Somerset. The establishment of the FM outlet allowed WRSL, a daytime-only radio station, to begin covering high school sporting events that took place after sunset. The launch of WRSL-FM, which began at 95.9\u00a0MHz, saw the formation of a simulcast with the AM station, with both stations broadcasting a country format; WRSL-FM would be one of the longest-running FM country outlets in central Kentucky. The station broadcast from WRSL's existing studios on US 27 north of town, with the FM transmitter being placed on the AM tower.\n\nWRSL-FM signed on amidst a multi-year shift in ownership of the Lincoln-Garrard Broadcasting Company, which owned the AM and FM outlets. In 1965, before the company had applied for an FM station, W. G. Morgan, on whose own farmland the station facilities sat, sold his share to Calvin C. Smith; Smith became the full owner in 1969 by buying out Lanier Burchette.\n\nThe Gaskin family ran WRSL-AM-FM from 1976 to 1982, when health reasons forced Jim Gaskin to relinquish operations; owner Cal Smith then split the two stations' programming and operated WRSL-AM-FM until his death at the age of 55 from pancreatic cancer in 1987. His wife, Ruth, ran the station until she retired in 1994 and sold it to their son, John Smith.\n\nSmith's time owning WRSL-FM was one of major change for the station. On June 30, 1995, WRSL-FM moved from 95.9 to 96.3\u00a0MHz, increased its power to 25,000 watts from 3,000, and activated its new transmitter on Sand Knob Road. The upgrade substantially increased its coverage area in central Kentucky, though no format changes were planned. The Sand Knob Road transmitter site was vandalized that December by two teenagers who stole equipment that formed WRSL-FM's studio-transmitter link.\n\nWXKY\nWRSL-FM became WXKY-FM, branded as \"Kentucky's Maximum Country\", on July 23, 2001, in a bid to play up its regional broadcast area. However, the station would not remain country for long. In January 2002, after being initially approached the year before, owner John Smith opted to lease the station to the Educational Media Foundation, which resulted in the Air 1 network being heard in central Kentucky for the first time; Smith noted that he thought his father, Cal, would have appreciated EMF's ministry, and that he hoped the change would further reinforce perceptions of WXKY-FM as a regional, not a Stanford, station. WXKY was sold in 2004 to EMF itself for $800,000, allowing it to operate noncommercially, and thus completely as a satellite.\n\nWXKY was off the air for two weeks and thereafter forced to operate for a time with reduced power after sustaining extensive fire damage in 2008.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n \t\n\nK-Love radio stations\nXKY\nEducational Media Foundation radio stations\nRadio stations established in 1967\n1967 establishments in Kentucky\nLincoln County, Kentucky\nXKY", "machine_text": "WXKY is a non-commercial radio station located in Cleveland, Ohio, broadcasting at 104.3 FM.

In 2010, the station rebranded itself as \"WKSU News,\" emphasizing its focus on delivering quality journalism to its listeners.

The bourgeoisie, or the middle class, holds significant economic and political power in this type of government, often at the expense of the less affluent. The term \"bourgeois government\" has its roots in the French Revolution of 1789, where the bourgeoisie played a significant role in the overthrow of the absolute monarchy. The bourgeoisie were a group of educated individuals who sought to challenge the existing social and political hierarchy and establish a new order in which they had greater power and influence. In a bourgeois government, the economy is often driven by capitalist principles, with private ownership of businesses and industries, and a focus on profit maximization. The government is typically limited in its regulatory role, and often favors policies that benefit the wealthy or middle class. Critics of bourgeois government argue that it perpetuates social inequality and restricts the ability of lower-income individuals to access power and influence. They point to the concentration of wealth and privilege in the hands of a few, and the resulting lack of representation for the broader population. Proponents of bourgeois government argue that it encourages innovation and entrepreneurship, creating economic growth and prosperity for all individuals, regardless of class.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Jemaah Tarbiyah\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Jemaah Tarbiyah, also known as the Tarbiyah movement or the Dakwah movement, is an Islamic religious movement based in Indonesia. Jemaah Tarbiyah was an active movement during the 1980s to 1990s and consisted of university students, aimed at the religious education and da'wah (proselytizing). The movement is considered to be influenced by the teaching of Muslim Brotherhood. It is considered an important influence for Islamization of Indonesia. The movement became the bedrock of the Islamist party Prosperous Justice Party (PKS) which was founded in 2002.\n\nEtymology\nThe term tarbiyah () means \"intensive Islamic education\" or \"disciplining\" in Arabic. Initially, the term was mainly used by outsiders to designate the particular phenomenon and activities conducted by certain groups. There has been no formal consensus on the naming by the activists of the movement. Tarbiyah is often used by Indonesian Islamic higher educational institutions as a name of faculties specialized in religious education. The term was also used by a socio-religious organization Union of Islamic Education (Persatuan Tarbiyah Islam, PERTI) established in 1928. The usage of tarbiyah in the context of Jemaah Tarbiyah has no direct relations with any of the latter.\n\nHistory\nThere had been a history of da'wah based on university campuses, notably of elite secular universities such as Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB) since the 1970s. However, there was a demand for more comprehensive and systematic methods of da'wah, which was still very informal and strictly monitored by the Suharto regime. Some religious gatherings based in Salman Mosque of ITB is considered one of many origins of Jemaah Tarbiyah. These religious gatherings put particular emphasis on specific attitudes toward basic Islamic teachings and interpretations, including the principle of ukhuwah (brotherhood), dress code, and the prohibition on smoking.\n\nAmong the activists of Jemaah Tarbiyah, four Muslim students returned from the Islamic University of Madinah, Hilmi Aminuddin, Salim Segaf Aljufri, Abdullah Said Baharmus, and Acep Abdul Syukur, are considered founding fathers (collectively called muassis). Facing demands of more systematic proselytization and religious education, these four students and their cohorts have articulated a comprehensive program and organized activities, improved with methodology from the Middle East which was often named as usrah system. Its religious gatherings were known as halaqah which involved mentoring and Qur'anic recitations. Since early to mid-1980s, the activity had quickly spread across elite secular universities, where religious education was required to be complemented.\n\nJemaah Tarbiyah has often been pointed out of its Muslim Brotherhood influence. Usrah system was a training program of Muslim Brotherhood members, and the Tarbiyah movement had directly implemented the methodology. Activists of the Tarbiyah movement are also considered to be committed toward translation of books written by members of Muslim Brotherhood, including Hassan al-Banna and Sayyid Qutb. There is also an explanation that links Jemaah Tarbiyah to the Indonesian Islamic Dawaah Council (DDII), a conservative Islamic organization headed by Mohammad Natsir. DDII had contributed to the constructions of mosques in the universities and was central to the importation of religious teachings from the Middle East. Some of the prominent activists of Jemaah Tarbiyah had DDII backgrounds.\n\nThroughout the 1980s, Jemaah Tarbiyah had managed to grow its influence underground, mostly due to its focus on religious issues and avoided political activism. The movement had also established formal institutions with similar aims but without explicit reference toward its connections. Such institutions include foundations like Nurul Fikri, Al-Hikmah Boarding School, and PA-HAM. In the 1990s, the movement had established influence over many intra-university student organizations and discussion forums. The movement accommodated various Islamic religious strands from traditionalist to modernists, and was fluid regarding pragmatic concerns such as political system.\n\nAfter the fall of Suharto and the beginning of the democratic transition, activists of the movement founded an Islamist political party Justice Party (PK) in 1998, and its successor Prosperous Justice Party (PKS) in 2002. Majority of the members of PK and PKS, including the first president of PK Nurmahmudi Ismail, were activists of Jemaah Tarbiyah. The establishment of a political party was chosen over the establishment of a formal socio-religious organization. The decision was supported by the majority of the activists. Main activities related to da'wah conducted during the Jemaah Tarbiyah era were succeeded by the political parties. Today, activists of Jemaah Tarbiyah have been continuously influencing the creation of new trends in da'wah and Islamic socio-religious movements, including One Day One Juz (ODOJ).\n\nNotes\n\nFootnotes\n\nReferences\nDamanik, A.S.

The primary goal of Jemaah Tarbiyah is to instill Islamic values and morals in its members and to promote a greater sense of brotherhood and sisterhood among the Muslim community. To achieve this goal, the organization has established a comprehensive system of education and training that covers various aspects of Islamic thought and practice. The educational program of Jemaah Tarbiyah is centered on the study of the Quran and Hadith, along with the teachings of prominent Islamic scholars. The organization also emphasizes the importance of character-building through acts of worship and charitable deeds. In addition to its educational activities, Jemaah Tarbiyah is also involved in social and community service projects. One of its major initiatives is the establishment of Islamic boarding schools known as pesantren, which provide a holistic education to young Muslims in Indonesia. Jemaah Tarbiyah has faced controversy and criticism for its alleged links to radical Islamic groups, particularly after the Bali bombings in 2002. However, the organization has denied any connection to terrorism and has reiterated its commitment to promoting peaceful and compassionate Islam. Despite these challenges, Jemaah Tarbiyah remains a significant force in Indonesian Islam, with hundreds of thousands of followers and a strong presence in many parts of the country.

He returned to EastEnders on 21 September 2010, following the return of on-screen wife Kat (Jessie Wallace) two episodes previously.\n\nSome of the character's more prominent storylines have included: his turbulent relationship withand later marriage toKat Slater; the dementia and death of his grandmother, Nana (Hilda Braid); believing that Kat's son Tommy had died of cot death, whereas in truth their neighbour Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack) had switched him with her own deceased child; discovering that Kat had been sleeping with Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman); beginning a relationship with Ronnie's sister Roxy (Rita Simons) and marrying her, but reuniting with Kat moments after the wedding; Kat's pregnancy with twinsBert and Ernie, destroying their home by committing arson to get the insurance money; winning the lottery; being diagnosed with a brain tumour; and reuniting with Kat until they split again when she discovers that he is the father of Cherry Slater.\n\nRichie and Wallace departed on-screen on 22 May 2015 before returning for a short stint from 26 December 2015 to 25 January 2016, before appearing in the six-part drama spin-off series, Kat & Alfie: Redwater, airing from 14 May 2017 until 18 June 2017. In March 2018, it was announced that Alfie would return to the show. He appeared on-screen on 24 and 25 May 2018 and returned again on 15 November 2018 and from 30 November 2018 to 22 January 2019.\n\nStorylines\n\n2002\u20132005\nAlfie Moon first appears when he is ejected from Walford East tube station for fare evasion. He then causes havoc in the local market by getting a refund from Winston (Ulric Browne) for a video he stole and tricking Martin Fowler (James Alexandrou) into giving him free fruit. After acquainting himself with a few residents, he sneaks into The Queen Victoria public house and helps himself to a drink behind the bar. The landlady, Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor), assumes that Alfie is Chris Wright (Tom Roberts), the new manager sent by an agency. Alfie takes advantage of the misunderstanding to commit identity fraud against Wright. Alfie packs any stock he could find in a bin bag, ready to leave. Jim Branning (John Bardon) catches him, but assumes Alfie is throwing away outdated stock and tricks Alfie into giving him a pint on the house. Winston, Martin, Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen) and Sam Mitchell (Kim Medcalf) realize that Alfie has told them all different background stories but he manages to reconcile the inconsistent stories. Alfie later answers the phone to the real Chris Wright and tells him the position is filled, revealing his intention to stay. Alfie's brother and grandmother arrive unannounced in Albert Square and move into the pub with Alfie, much to his dismay. When Alfie is blackmailed by a former police officer, Dougie Slade (John Bowler), who reveals Alfie's true identity to Peggy, Alfie and his family are forced to flee with the pub's takings. However, Alfie leaves the money on Peggy's doorstep. Peggy manages to track him down and after he confides in her about his parents' death, she gives him another chance. Alfie reluctantly accepts her proposal.\n\nAlfie shares a bond with barmaid Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) and an attraction develops. Eventually Kat reciprocates his feelings and one night when the pub is closed, Kat reveals her feelings to him. They decide to embark on their relationship slowly, but his inability to trust her causes her to rethink the romance and she breaks up with Alfie, within less than a week. Alfie is heartbroken when Kat returns from a trip to New York with local mobster Andy Hunter (Michael Higgs), who soon becomes engaged to Kat after the trip. Andy, knowing Alfie's feelings for Kat, warns him to stay away from her and the wedding. Before the wedding, Kat visits Alfie's grandmother, Nana Moon (Hilda Braid) in hospital, and thinking she is asleep, admits she still loves Alfie. Nana tells Alfie and he rushes to the wedding to confess his true feelings as the ceremony takes place. Kat jilts Andy and he swears revenge before leaving Walford. Alfie and Kat quickly get engaged and decide to hold the wedding on Christmas Day, less than a month away. However, Alfie is still married to his first wife, Liza (Joanne Adams). Liza's mother, Marlene (Christine Ellerbeck) tells Alfie that their divorce is finalised, so he starts to prepare the wedding to Kat, until Liza reveals they are not divorced. There are only a few days before the wedding so he tries to quickly finalise the divorce while trying to keep it secret from Kat, though Liza makes it difficult as she wants Alfie to take her back. Alfie is forced to cancel the minister on Christmas Day and he panics, but gets his friend Ray (David Walliams) to pretend to be a minister, while planning to tell Kat the truth a few days later. Alfie's brother, Spencer Moon (Christopher Parker), warns Alfie not to start his marriage with a lie, so Alfie reveals the truth to a furious Kat. Alfie is about to tell the guests that the wedding is cancelled when his solicitor enters with Alfie's decree absolute. Alfie convinces the minister to cancel his Christmas lunch, and Alfie and Kat marry.\n\nAfter a while, Alfie borrows several thousand pounds from Andy to bail out Kat's father, Charlie Slater (Derek Martin), who has been arrested for assault. Andy begins demanding cash every week, which he knows Alfie cannot afford. Andy's plan to wreck the Moons' marriage starts to work and Andy offers Kat the chance to pay off the debt by spending time with him in bed. She reluctantly agrees and they sleep together, with a reluctant Kat oozing with guilt. Though unknown to her, Alfie has paid Andy the money. Andy keeps the money and gives Alfie a video tape of Kat cheating on Alfie with him. They watch the sex tape together and she reveals the whole story behind her infidelity. When Alfie insults Kat, she slaps him, with him doing the same thing. Afterwards, the couple attempt to put the incident behind them but their marriage starts to deteriorate and Alfie is unable to trust Kat. She moves out of Walford for while. During her return, it is seen that Kat has become an alcoholic and isn't bothered by the fact that Alfie wants them to resume their marriage. Kat has sex with Roger (Russell Boulter), a stranger, while intoxicated and finally sees sense, deciding to return to Alfie, but he discovers she has slept with a man she doesn't know and throws her out, so she leaves Walford again.\n\nAlfie shares a mutual connection with Kat's sister, Little Mo Mitchell (Kacey Ainsworth), whose marriage to Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick) has collapsed. Alfie helps Little Mo bring up her baby, Freddie, and they decide to announce that they are an item. However, Kat returns before they have a chance, and she makes it clear that she wants Alfie back. He is torn between the two sisters, eventually choosing Kat. He lets Little Mo down gently, and they share a final goodbye hug, which Billy assumes is them getting together. In the pub, Billy drunkenly announces that Alfie and Little Mo are an item. Kat is furious and decides not to get together with Alfie, so as not to break her sister's heart. However, Alfie and Kat continue to grow closer, due to Kat's relationship with Alfie's grandmother, who is dying. After Kat helps Alfie complete some of Nana's final wishes and overcome her death, they long for each other. Alfie announces that he is leaving to drive across the United States in a Ford Capri, and it seems he has gone for good when he waves goodbye to a heartbroken Kat on Christmas Day 2005. After getting drunk and drowning her sorrows in the pub, Kat is stunned to see Alfie waiting for her outside. Kat and Alfie then get into the car together and drive off.\n\n2010\u20132016\n\nKat returns to London, revealing that she and Alfie conned a man called Frankie Finnerty and she is now on the run. His relatives Lee and Jono Finnerty (Dylan Brown and Colin Parry) track her down but Alfie scares them off by pretending to be a CID officer, though they take most of Kat's money. Alfie and Kat have a heart to heart and it is revealed that Alfie spent six months in prison for property fraud and they tried to have a baby but he has fertility problems. Kat is not interested and tries to leave, telling him that she is pregnant and he is not the father. Alfie doubles the remainder of Kat's money in a bet and promises to stop scamming and get a proper job. Kat gives him 24 hours. He uses Kat's money and uses it to rent The Queen Vic from Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). Kat is angry and demands he get the money back as they need a regular income. Instead, he sets up an illegal drinking den in the cellar and they move into Kim Fox's (Tameka Empson) caravan on the Square.\n\nAlfie hires Greg Jessop (Stefan Booth) to refurbish The Queen Vic and Alfie's cousin, Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd), gives him money for The Queen Vic lease. He introduces Michael to Kat and Michael says that he is returning to Spain and asks her to go with him. He leaves a letter and some money for Alfie, revealing that he is the baby's father. Alfie tells Kat that he wants the baby but she doesn't believe him and agrees to leave with Michael but changes her mind when she sees that Alfie has bought a cot and some baby toys. Alfie struggles to pay the rent and tries gambling again but loses. However, Phil's cousin Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons) helps out by paying two months rent for him and he shows Kat the newly refurbished pub. However, on the day of the grand opening, there is a problem so the pub doesn't open until the next day. Kat sees Alfie and Roxy together and fights with Roxy. Alfie takes Roxy's side and ejects Kat but they reconcile and Alfie suggests renewing their wedding vows and Kat agrees. The day does not go quite according to plan as Alfie helps Roxy with her sister Ronnie Mitchell's (Samantha Womack) wedding. However, Kat decides that she does not need a big ceremony so she and Alfie have one in the Square with just him and Kat.\n\nKat gives birth to a boy named Tommy but is rushed to hospital as she haemorrhages, due to a damaged placenta. Charlie decides to join the New Year's party, rather than stay with Tommy so he is unattended when Ronnie Mitchell finds herself in The Queen Vic with her dead son and she swaps the babies. When Alfie gets home, he finds \"Tommy\" dead in his cot. Kat and Alfie struggle to cope with their loss but eventually start to deal with it until Michael returns, wanting to see his son. Kat tells Michael to leave but he stays because he has friends locally. Kat kisses Michael but he rejects her, leading her to break down. Eventually Alfie moves out after they have a row and goes away for a weekend with Michael. Kat tells Alfie that a coroner has confirmed that Tommy (James) died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. He comforts her and they reconcile. Eventually, Ronnie admits to Kat that she swapped the babies and returns Tommy. Alfie and Kat are reunited with Tommy after talking to a social worker. Ronnie goes to prison for her crime and Kat forgives her. She and Alfie holiday in Spain, leaving Alfie's cousin, Eddie Moon (David Essex), to look after the pub. When they return, they bring Shenice Quinn (Lily Harvey) with them, daughter of Kat's friend, Martina Quinn (Tamara Wall). Kat finds out she is pregnant and Alfie asks who the father is, refusing to believe Kat has not cheated. Alfie realises he has gone too far but Kat is not interested in his apologies, even after she miscarries. She tells him she does not want any more children and that their relationship will just be for show from now on, leading her to have a one-night stand with Mark Garland (Chris Simmons), which she regrets after hearing Alfie's voicemail, saying how much he loves her. Alfie takes Kat, Tommy and Shenice on holiday but when they return, Kat tells Alfie that she cheated. They discuss it and Alfie insists that he would rather Kat cheat on him than not have her in his life. Kat isn't happy and is further upset when Alfie will not allow her to explain that she did not cheat again. They try to mend things over Christmas but Alfie hears Kat say that she does not think he loves her. Alfie pays a friend Gerry (Paul Reynolds) to claim he is a marriage counsellor and tell Kat that their marriage can be mended. However, when Alfie deliberately leaves them alone, she says she thinks Alfie does not love her and she wants to end the marriage. Gerry tries to tell Alfie but he thinks that Gerry has helped. When Charlie has a stroke, Alfie and Kat visit but he returns alone. Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman) gets Alfie into a VAT scam and Alfie helps Roxy and Billy set Derek up by intercepting his alcohol deliveries. Alfie struggles financially and considers firing Jean and stores Derek's goods at the pub to earn extra cash but when Phil demands Alfie stop, Derek arranges with Alfie and Billy to steal a large amount of alcohol. However, Derek is scammed by Alfie and Billy and he suspects Phil conned him. When Billy is arrested on suspicion of murdering Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison), Derek worries that he may implicate them in the alcohol theft and asks Alfie to frame Phil by hiding goods at his garage. However, Alfie is caught and Phil confronts him, making it clear that Alfie takes orders from him, not Derek. When Derek learns that Alfie has told Phil everything, he furiously threatens Alfie.\n\nIn Kat's absence, Alfie and Roxy become close friends and Roxy tells Alfie that she is in love with him. This makes things awkward and she quits her job at the pub. After a while, Alfie manages to convince Roxy to return and offers her a place to stay. Jean is conned out of money that belongs to The Queen Victoria while Alfie is away and when he returns, he borrows money from Roxy to pay the bills, angering Kat. Alfie starts a pub football team and pays more attention to that than to Kat, so she starts an affair. Kat tries to resist but eventually the affair turns to love. When Kat's lover sends her flowers, Alfie becomes suspicious and asks Kat if she is seeing someone else. She denies it initially but eventually admits it, refusing to say who the other man is. Alfie demand Kat end the affair but Alfie struggles to trust Kat, especially when he finds a ring he thought had been pawned. Wanting to catch her out, Alfie says he will be away overnight and follows her to a nearby flat, demanding to know who Kat is seeing but she still refuses to name him. Alfie finds a letter to \"Mr. Branning\" and confronts the three brothers, attacking Max when he sees that Kat is calling. Kat arrives and tells him that she is seeing Derek. Alfie throws Kat out again and Derek makes matters worse when he plays Alfie a message, asking to meet. Alfie punches Derek and tells him that he is barred before giving Derek his wedding ring to give to Kat. Alfie starts dating Roxy and asks her to move in and they declare their love for each other. Alfie helps Kat when she is questioned over stolen goods, but to prove to Roxy that he loves her, Alfie decides to get a divorce. Alfie and Roxy decide to try for a baby, but when Kat and Alfie's decree nisi comes through, it is apparent that Alfie still loves Kat. He is determined to move on so proposes to Roxy and she accepts.\n\nAlfie discovers Ronnie is being released from prison but thinks that she will not return to Walford. He is angry to discover that she has and demands Roxy choose, him or Ronnie. Roxy chooses Alfie but Kat persuades him to accept Ronnie's presence and let Roxy see her sister. Kat supports Alfie after Michael's death and the two become closer. The night before his wedding, Alfie visits Kat and they kiss passionately. On his wedding day, Alfie tells Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) that he still loves Kat but marries Roxy. Roxy realises that Alfie is still in love with Kat and orders him out of the church. He learns that Kat is going to Ibiza and races to the airport. They reconcile, moments before her flight is due to depart. As revenge for Alfie's treatment of Roxy, Phil sells The Queen Vic, forcing Alfie and Kat out. Kat tells Alfie that she is pregnant and they move in with Kat's grandmother, Mo Harris (Laila Morse). Kat has a market stall, selling women's clothes, but Alfie isn't as successful as goes to help Spencer  in Australia for a while. He returns a month later and tells Kat that he has just bought a classic Ford Capri. After a night in a posh hotel, they return to Walford and Alfie sets up a burger bar on the Square but this is taken away so he sets up a men's clothes stall instead. This doesn't last thanks to a feud with the market inspector, Aleks Shirovs (Kristian Kiehling), so he gets a job at Ian's caf\u00e9. Kat and Alfie are thrilled when their twin sons, Bert and Ernie (Freddie and Stanley Beale), are born.\n\nAlfie receives a letter from the council, stating that they are due to be evicted from No. 23 Albert Square. He doesn't tell Kat but Stacey finds it and forces him to tell Kat and Mo. Alfie tells Kat that he has got a bank loan but considers starting a fire for the insurance money. Despite Mick Carter (Danny Dyer) advising him against it, he drops a lit cigarette into a paper-filled wastebasket. When outside, he learns Kat is in the house and rushes back to rescue her but Mo's stash of dodgy hairspray causes an explosion, just as Alfie opens the front door. He rescues Kat regardless, receiving minor burns, but Kat is badly burnt. Alfie and the Moons are supported by the local community and stay with the Masood family. Alfie is praised as a hero, despite being suspected by local firefighter Tosh. However, the fire investigation officer declares the fire an accident but Mick advises him not to tell Kat that he started the fire and when Kat thanks him for saving her life, he takes Mick's advice. He is relieved when the fire investigation officer Neil Wallace informs him that the insurers will probably pay for the damage to be repaired but Stacey finds the picture of Nana Moon and realises Alfie started the fire and demands Alfie tell Kat but he refuses, creating a rift between them. The insurance company also refuse to pay for the damage as Mo's quantity of hairspray is listed as commercial goods, invalidating the policy. He tells Stacey Branning (Lacey Turner) and she suggests ringing the insurance company again but Alfie refuses, adamant that they won\u2019t change their decision and blames Mo. Stacey then suggests Alfie use the proceeds from selling the Capri to sort out their finances but he can't as the money was spent on food and the children. Masood Ahmed (Nitin Ganatra) returns home and asks Alfie when they will be moving out as the house is too crowded but Alfie loses his temper with Masood and accuses him of kicking them out.\n\nNeeding a place of their own, Alfie tries to persuade an estate agent to let him stay in number 43 for a couple of nights but the agent dismisses the idea. So he goes to the council for temporary accommodation and is told that all they can offer is one night in a bed and breakfast. Returning to the Square, Alfie tells Stacey about the mess they\u2019re in and she insists he tell Kat the truth but before he can, she asks him to marry her. He agrees and they marry at the registrar's office with two nurses as witnesses and return to Walford. They squat in a couple of places before Mick invites them to stay at The Queen Vic. After an emotional speech from Kat to the social housing manager, they are offered a council house in Hull but just as they are about to leave, Kat finds a photo of Nana. Wanting to know how it survived the fire, Alfie admits that he started it and tries to apologise, but Kat leaves him, moving in with Stacey and Lily. Later, as Christmas approaches, Alfie tells Kat that he will try to fix things.\n\nMo tells Kat that Harry left her some money in his will. Alfie finds out, and tries to convince her to use the money to make a fresh start after the divorce but she destroys the cheque, insisting it doesn't change the past nor their impending divorce. Kat has second thoughts about the divorce after Pam Coker (Lin Blakley) gives a speech about love and family and Stacey tells Alfie that their rent is increasing and Kat is struggling financially so Alfie invites Kat to his flat for lunch and they reminisce about their relationship. The next day, Kat lashes out at Alfie for leaving leftovers for the kids, but at Stacey's urging, she agrees to be his date to Ian and Jane's wedding if he makes more effort for making up for the fire.\n\nMo has Harry's money transferred to her account and tells Alfie. He insists that this is not good for Kat and tells her so she burns the money. Sadly, this makes her very depressed and she tries to commit suicide but Alfie finds her and calls an ambulance. At the hospital, he admits that he is still in love with her. He takes her home and decides to stay temporarily to help her with the kids and her assessment by Social Services. During the social worker's visit, Kat is withdrawn and won't answer questions, insisting she is fine but Alfie tells the social worker that they are working on it and admits feeling guilty for starting the fire. After Kat visits a convent (Zoe's birthplace), she makes peace with the past and tells Alfie and Stacey that she will claim the money. Alfie and Stacey discover that Kat's claim won't grant her any money so he takes Kat on a trip to central London, giving them a chance to reminisce before having lunch at a posh restaurant. Kat knows that she won't get any compensation and is disgusted when Alfie tells her he already knew. Soon after, Kat takes the opportunity to tell Alfie that she wants them to reconcile and although initially resisting, he changes his mind once back in Walford. On the spur of the moment, they buy a scratchcard and realise they have won \u00a31,000,000. Alfie and Kat decide to use the money to move somewhere new and run a bar. Alfie suggests going to Australia but he and Kat decide to return to Spain so she can be closer to Zoe. But after tests, a doctor tells Alfie he may have a brain tumour. Kat buys plane tickets for the next day and Alfie chooses not to tell Kat about the tumour and ignore warnings that the tumour will grow. Sonia Fowler (Natalie Cassidy) also advises him not to fly as this could cause problems so they drive to Spain.\n\nOn Christmas Day 2015, Kat returns to Walford to spend Christmas with Stacey. Alfie follows with the boys. While at Mick's stag party, Alfie tells Ian and Phil that he may have a brain tumour. Ian and Phil go with him to a hospital appointment, where he learns that the tumour has stopped growing but he may need an operation if he begins showing symptoms. Alfie tells Kat about his tumour and in turn, Kat tells Alfie that she has a son living in Ireland. After Charlie dies from a heart attack, Kat and Alfie decide to search for her son. After saying their goodbyes, Kat and Alfie depart.\n\nKat & Alfie: Redwater\nIn episode 1 of Kat & Alfie: Redwater, Alfie, Kat and Tommy arrive in the Irish town of Redwater, saying they are on holiday. Alfie tells Kat to make friends before asking questions and trying to find her son and when she immediately thinks it is Andrew Kelly (Peter Campion), Alfie warns her that she could be wrong. Alfie starts to have visions and gets scared when he goes outside in the night and almost falls from a cliff. Alfie finds out about the Redwater Tragedy from local priest, Dermott Dolan (Ois\u00edn Stack), in which Dermott's mother, Iris Dolan (Orla Hannon) drowned in a boating accident. In episode 2, Alfie gets stuck up a cliff when helping Tommy, but Dermott rescues him. Tommy goes missing but Kat finds him in the church and discovers that Dermott is her son. In episode 3, Alfie realises that Kat lied to Dermott about who Dermott's father is, which results in an argument. By episode 5, Alfie is worried about his hallucinations and has a brain scan, lying to Kat about where he is going. He then tells Dermott that his tumour has grown and asks Dermott to baptise him, which he does. In episode 6, Alfie prepares for an operation on his brain, and is told his recovery could take weeks so he will be unable to return to Spain as planned. He asks Dermott to bring Kat to the hospital, but Dermott does not do this because the police suspect he was involved in the death of Lance Byrne (Ian McElhinney). Alfie is unable to wait and during the surgery, Alfie loses his pulse and at the same time, Kat is seriously injured in a boating accident caused by Dermott's attempting to escape. Medical staff start to resuscitate Alfie as the episode ends.\n\n2018\u20132019\nHaving recovered from his operation, Alfie and Kat return to Spain to run a bar. Mo returns in March 2018 and reveals that Kat and Alfie had an argument and that he fled with the children shortly afterwards and no one knows where he is. On her return to Walford shortly afterwards, Kat reveals that Alfie is in Spain with their children, running a different bar with a Russian partner, Dimitri, after their old bar lost a fortune. She insists that the two are taking a break from their marriage. Two months later, Hayley Slater (Katie Jarvis) visits Alfie, who is staying in London, and it is revealed that Alfie threw Kat out after Tommy accidentally caused severe burns to Ernie while she was in bed with Dimitri. Hayley reveals that she is pregnant and that Alfie is the father following a drunken one-night stand in Spain. Alfie tries to persuade Hayley to terminate the pregnancy and returns to Spain, but Hayley decides to keep the baby.\n\nKat gets a video call from Alfie and he asks her to collect something for him. Believing him to still be in Spain, she follows his instructions and goes to a chapel where she is surprised to see Alfie in person. Alfie is running a funeral business and has many clients lined up, but Kat is unimpressed and only sees it as a scam. She is angry that he has not brought their children with him, but apologies for cheating on him with Dimitri. Kat tells him to stop his lies and jokes and she leaves. The following week Kat speaks to Alfie, who is back in Spain, by video call and she is angry when he says he lied to her and actually did bring the children with him to London. Two weeks later, during Hayley's birthday party, Kat answers the door and is shocked to see Alfie standing on the doorstep. Though he reunites with Kat, he is stunned to realise that Hayley did not terminate her pregnancy, and insists they keep the truth hidden from Kat. Hayley develops feelings for him when she sees him bond with their daughter, named Cherry by Alfie after his deceased mother. Jean, who is the only one who has found out about Alfie being Cherry's father, insists that Alfie tell Kat or she will.\n\nStacey sees Hayley and Alfie kissing and is horrified to uncover Cherry's paternity and issues an ultimatum: one of them leaves, or Kat learns the truth. Hayley decides to go, but her parting gift to Alfie \u2013 a lock of Cherry's hair \u2013 is discovered by Kat and she works out the truth. After a furious showdown, Alfie turns nasty with Kat, who accuses him of taking advantage of Hayley's vulnerability. Hayley defends Kat and pushes Alfie, causing him to fall down the stairs and knock himself unconscious. Believing that he is dead, Hayley, Kat and Stacey discuss what to do to protect Hayley from going to prison. Kat privately says a tender goodbye to Alfie, kissing him and telling him she loves him. As the police arrive, they discover that Alfie survived and has left, taking Cherry with him. The next day, Alfie meets Phil, who gives him fake passports but warns Alfie to think carefully about his plans. Alfie then listens to a voicemail Kat left him on his phone, pleading with him to bring Cherry back. Alfie eventually contacts Kat and Hayley via video chat and says he will bring Cherry back soon. On New Year's Day, Alfie and Kat meet and Kat tries to talk him into returning Cherry but Alfie admits he cannot bring himself to do it, fearing he would only be granted limited visitation time, and suggests he and Kat adopt Cherry and leave together. Kat tells Alfie she accepts and brings Alfie to the house, claiming it is empty but when Alfie arrives, he is confronted by Stacey, Mo and Jean. Angry and upset, he shows them Ernie's scars caused by Kat's irresponsibility. When Kat takes the children for ice cream, she gives Alfie the option to take them with him on the condition that he brings Cherry back to Hayley. Alfie eventually relents to return Cherry and leave their children with Kat, admitting that he loves her and only wanted her to be happy. The next day, after emotionally attempting to say goodbye to Cherry, Alfie changes his mind and attempts to drive out of Walford with her but finds himself stuck in traffic. This forces him to reevaluate his decision and he turns back and returns Cherry to Hayley. An overjoyed but protective Hayley tells a dejected Alfie that she cannot let him be a part of Cherry's life. After learning of this from Ian, a sympathetic Kat allows him to spend time with their children.\n\nSeveral days later, Alfie does some DIY work at the Slater house, while Kat resists all his attempts to charm her but eventually relents to an early birthday lunch at The Queen Vic with him, Mo, Stacey, her husband Martin Fowler (James Bye), Jean Slater (Gillian Wright) and Cherry, whom Hayley allows him to bring along for the day. After finding that his credit card has been declined and making a toast to Kat, Alfie receives a phone call from the bank, causing him to rush over to the Beale house where he is staying where he finds overdue bills from running his funeral business. The next day, after Alfie unsuccessfully tries to help Hayley with feeding Cherry her breast milk, the father of a deceased client accuses Alfie of stealing his son's money after a mix-up with the funeral plans, and Ian threatens to kick Alfie out for stealing his food. Under stress, Alfie confesses his troubles to a horrified Kat, including the fact that some of the money was paid for her new fireplace. In order to reimburse the client's family and pay the bills, Alfie decides to look for investors for the business and Ian offers to buy a 50% stake in the business for a loan with 20% interest, which he accepts. Later, after explaining this to a concerned Kat, who reprimands him for his schemes, Alfie and the rest of the Slaters are stunned to find Hayley unconscious from drinking after locking herself in the bathroom with Cherry. Knowing she is struggling being a mother, Alfie suggests to Kat that they adopt Cherry, but Kat is unsure. Soon after, customers of Alfie's funeral business start contacting him and one coming to see him in person, accusing him of swindling them of money. Needing to pay them back, he persuades Phil to lend him 30,000 pounds and offering his expensive car as collateral. Alfie then does a runner and Phil is angry when he takes the money and the car with him. Phil threatens Kat, saying she will pay back the money to him if Alfie does not. When she gets a text from Alfie telling her to look in the wardrobe, she is stunned when the money falls out of it, having left it behind for her. Although the text says he will be returning soon, he does not come back. Kat uses the money to pay for Jean's cancer treatment, leaving her in further debt to Phil. Phil later demands Kat find Alfie but she assures him she does not know where he is.\n\nCreation and development\nAlfie Moon was conceptualised by EastEnders''' scriptwriter Tony Jordan. The character is based on Jordan himself. Jordan has commented, \"Alfie is basically me \u2013 a Jack The Lad in jeans, cowboy boots and dodgy shirts who wears his heart on his sleeve.\" Julia Crampsie, the BBC's casting executive, recommended that Shane Richie be considered for the role. Richie was already a familiar face to the UK audience, having had a career as an entertainer, appearing in various gameshows, variety shows and fronting advertising campaigns, most notably for the washing detergent Daz. Jordan was apprehensive about casting Ritchie in the role. He commented, \"I just had this image of the guy with the mullet from the Daz adverts. And if we had Shane where would it stop? Harry Hill? Les Dennis? Bradley Walsh? But Julia was insistent, so I went to a workshop where we'd see lots of actors and [Richie] was fantastic.\"\n\nJordan has suggested that many of the rows featured on-screen between Alfie and his love-interest Kat were word-for-word arguments he had with his wife, Tracy. He commented, \"We'd be watching EastEnders at home, then an Alfie and Kat scene would start and I'd think, 'Oh shit', because I'd know what was coming. And then we'd have another row about how I don't argue properly because when we do argue I'm just making mental notes for stuff to write the next day.\"\n\nReintroduction (2010)\nOn 7 February 2010 it was announced that Richie would return to the show to reprise the role in autumn 2010. The decision was made following the resignation from the show of Barbara Windsor, who played Peggy Mitchell, which left what executive producer Bryan Kirkwood described as a \"hole\" in the programme. Kirkwood decided that the time was right for Kat and Alfie to return, saying that they \"very much herald the new era of EastEnders.\" Richie had ruled out a return in 2009, saying that the show had moved on from his character and he felt he did not have the energy to be in such a \"full-on\" show again. Richie commented on his return: \"It's an honour and a privilege to be asked back to the iconic series of EastEnders which is at the top of its game! I'm looking forward to finding out what Alfie has been up to over the last few years but more importantly \u2013 what the future has in store for him.\" John Yorke, controller of BBC drama production, said: \"Alfie is one of EastEnders most loved and iconic characters, so he's bound to get a very warm welcome from viewers when he returns to Walford. We've had so many new and interesting characters settle into Albert Square since Alfie departed that it's going to make for fantastic viewing when one of the show's most familiar faces rides back into the East End.\" It was reported by The Daily Mirror that Alfie and Kat would regain control of The Queen Victoria public house after it burns down. Controller of BBC drama production John Yorke predicted that their return would make \"fantastic viewing\", given the wealth of new characters introduced since their departure. Wallace and Richie were the first cast members signed by new executive producer Bryan Kirkwood.\n\nThe plot saw Alfie and Kat regaining control of The Queen Victoria public house after it burned down, and Kat returning to Walford pregnant, with some public suspicions about the paternity of her child. To promote the characters' return, the BBC released a trailer across the BBC network in September 2010. The western-themed trailer sees Kat outside of The Queen Victoria, with various characters looking on and Kat saying \"Where d'ya get a drink around 'ere?\" with Alfie replying \"I think you're gonna' need one.\" The advertisement uses the tag line \"It's all kicking off in the square\". The return, in September 2010, drew 9.22 million viewers and 37.7% of the total TV viewing audience. Kat returned on 17 September 2010.\n\nTalking to What's on TV, Wallace commented on Kat's reunion with Alfie. She said: \"She punches him! Alfie has come looking for her and hasn't seen her for months. He keeps saying to her 'You're fat' and she says 'I'm not fat. I'm pregnant!' Then she says, 'Don't worry Alfie, it ain't yours'. She's peed off with him. He's been in prison and she's had to survive on her own pregnant. But she loves him unconditionally. No matter what they do, they will always end up together. She wants stability... a future for the baby and her. She sets him this challenge and he buys it.\"\n\nBaby swap\n\nRichie revealed in an interview with This Morning that Kat and Alfie would be involved in an ongoing storyline, which he said is \"going to be the biggest soap story in probably the history of soaps.\" At the end of 2010, Kat and Ronnie both give birth on the same day, but Ronnie's baby, James, dies and while Kat is in hospital and her baby, Tommy, is unattended, Ronnie swaps the infants. The storyline received over 6,000 complaints, making it the second most complained about EastEnders storyline. It was then decided to end the storyline earlier than originally planned. It was reported by the Daily Star Sunday that Ronnie experiences a change of heart after visiting relatives in hospital and seeing the midwife who delivered her son. An EastEnders spokesperson said, \"We do not comment on future storylines but we have always said Ronnie will do the right thing and Tommy will be reunited with Kat.\" Wallace revealed that she doesn't regret her involvement of the baby-swap storyline, saying that she was \"just doing her job\". Wallace told Bang Showbiz:\"I stand by it. We're actors at the end of the day, we do our job and then we go home. It's drama, that's it.\" She also praised Womack's acting and will move on to \"bigger and better things\" once she departs later this year. She added: \"[Samantha is] a fantastic actress who played a brilliant role in a fantastic storyline so I wish her all the best.\"\n\nDerek Martin said he was surprised by the new baby swap storyline when it was published in the media. Speaking on This Morning, Martin commented: \"I'm one of those actors \u2013 I don't know how many others do it \u2013 but when I get the scripts, I only read my bits. So I looked [and saw], 'Charlie leaves his grandson upstairs, goes downstairs, gets on the drink, gets drunk \u2013 the baby's dead'. So that's terrible guilt obviously \u2013 because I feel as though it's my fault that he's died. I was surprised when I saw the story come out \u2013 because I don't read the others' [lines] \u2013 that it was a baby swap.\" Discussing the surrounding controversy of the plot, Martin added: \"Don't forget, there's millions of people \u2013 there's 60 odd million here, and they've all got different opinions. Every subject, everything that comes up\u2026 everybody will have opinions about that. So therefore you have to accept that's the public \u2013 some are for, some are against, and that's the way it is.\"  He continues: \"Over the years, don't forget, EastEnders have always had subjects. When [Charlie's] brother had raped Kat and we didn't find out until later on, that was a very strong storyline. And when Little Mo was bashed by her husband Trevor. These stories are all part of real life.\"\n\nSamantha Womack admitted that she thought the plot was \"implausible\". She commented: \"I thought it was implausible. Most women who lose a child would not go out and abduct one,\" she told The Mirror. \"But Ronnie is a soap character and she is not necessarily representing real life. Soap is based on controversy and sensationalism because bosses are trying to get high ratings and they can't write things like 'Ronnie had a cup of tea'. Otherwise people wouldn't watch it.\" On 1 August 2011, Ofcom cleared the storyline. The baby swap storyline prompted a huge 1,044 complaints reported to Ofcom. Ofcom also added that many of the complaints were made because the storyline was presented \"in an offensive manner\" because it \"appeared to suggest that a mother who has suddenly and tragically lost a baby through cot death would react by stealing another baby to replace that loss\". Kym Marsh supported Ofcom's decision to clear the storyline. Marsh wrote in her magazine section: \"Last week, EastEnders was cleared of wrongdoing by Ofcom, the media regulator, over its baby swap storyline, and I think that's the right decision. It's just a storyline, like any other. I understand why people got upset about it, but no-one meant to upset anybody. Soaps are supposed to portray real life to a certain extent, but it's meant to be high drama for entertainment purposes. I mean, how many murders can you have in one square? There's a nod to real life but, for the most part, soaps help take people out of the real world.\"\n\nArson, second departure and Redwater\n\nIn August 2014, it was revealed that a fire would engulf the Slater house. On 2 September, it was revealed that Alfie would start the fire in return of an insurance claim, after having been broke following the birth of the twins, with Kat still inside. The fire and its aftermath took place on the week of 15 September 2014.\n\nOn 4 April 2015, it was announced that Richie would appear in a six-part BBC One drama series alongside Wallace. In the series, Kat and Alfie Moon will go to Ireland in the \"search for answers to some very big questions\". Commenting on the opportunity, Richie said: \"Both Jessie and I are absolutely thrilled to be given this amazing opportunity. To have a whole drama focused around Kat and Alfie is a huge honour for us both and we just can't wait to start filming.\" The series, Kat & Alfie: Redwater, started in the UK on 18 May 2017 and Ireland on 14 May 2017.\n\nReturn (2018)\n\nIn March 2018 it was confirmed that Alfie would return to the show for a short stint to rejoin Kat. It was said that Richie would start filming in the coming weeks, and Alfie would reappear from summer 2018. He returned on 24 May 2018, appearing for two episodes before making another brief return between November 2018 and January 2019.\n\nReception\n\nRichie has received immediate acclaim for bringing humour to a programme so depressing and has won a number of awards and nominations for his portrayal of Alfie. In the National Television Awards, he won Most Popular Actor in 2003, with nominations in 2004 and 2005. He was nominated in the Best Newcomer and Best Comedy Performance categories at the British Soap Awards in 2003, and won Best Actor in 2004 along with nominations for Best Comedy Performance and Best On-Screen Partnership (shared with Wallace). He also won Best Actor in 2005, and was nominated in 2006, as well as being nominated for Best Exit along with Wallace in 2006.  He was further nominated in 2011 for 'Best Actor. Richie won Funniest Character, Sexiest Male and Best Newcomer at the 2003 Inside Soap Awards and Richie, Wallace and Parker won the award for Best Family. Richie and Wallace won Best Couple in the 2004 Inside Soap Awards and Richie, Wallace, Parker and Braid won the accolade for Best Family for the second year. He was shortlisted in the 'Best Actor' category at the 2012 Inside Soap Awards and was shortlisted for the Funniest Male accolade in the 2014 Inside Soap'' Awards. At the TV Quick Awards, he was awarded Best Soap Newcomer in 2003, and Best Soap Actor in 2004 and 2005. In 2004, he won a Rose d'Or for Best Performance in a Soap.\n\nSee also\nList of EastEnders characters (2002)\nList of soap opera villains\nList of Kat & Alfie: Redwater characters\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\nEastEnders characters\nFictional bartenders\nTelevision characters introduced in 2002\nFictional market stallholders\nFictional criminals in soap operas\nFictional fraudsters\nMale villains\nFictional characters with cancer\nMale characters in television\nFictional con artists\nFictional thieves", "machine_text": "Alfie Moon is a fictional character from the popular British soap opera, EastEnders. Created by writer Tony Jordan, Alfie was first introduced to the show in 2002 as the love interest of Kat Slater. Alfie, played by actor Shane Richie, quickly became a fan favorite with his charm, wit, and dodgy dealing. He was the landlord of the Queen Vic pub, and often found himself in the middle of various storylines and dramas. One of Alfie's most memorable storylines was when he discovered that he was the long-lost father of Kat's son, Tommy. This revelation caused a lot of upheaval in his relationship with Kat and led to the iconic line, \"You're not my mother!\" Throughout his time on EastEnders, Alfie was also involved in several other storylines, including his struggle with depression, his brief stint as a market trader, and his tumultuous relationships with various women. Despite the ups and downs of his personal life, Alfie remained a popular character on the show. He left EastEnders in 2019 but returned for a special episode in 2020. In addition to his success on the small screen, Alfie also had a brief music career. In 2003, he released a cover of the Frank Sinatra classic \"Something Stupid\" with Kat, which reached number one on the UK singles chart. Overall, Alfie Moon will always be remembered as a beloved character in the history of EastEnders, and his antics at the Queen Vic will forever live on in the hearts of fans.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1682924}

Monarchs may be autocrats (as in all absolute monarchies) or may be ceremonial figureheads, exercising only limited or no reserve powers at all, with actual authority vested in a legislature and/or executive cabinet (as in many constitutional monarchies). In many cases, a monarch will also be linked with a state religion. Most states only have a single monarch at any given time, although a regent may rule when the monarch is a minor, not present, or otherwise incapable of ruling. Cases in which two monarchs rule simultaneously over a single state, as is the current situation in Andorra, are known as coregencies.\n\nA variety of titles are applied in English; for example, \"king\" and \"queen\", \"prince\" and \"princess\", \"emperor\" and \"empress\". Although they will be addressed differently in their local languages, the names and titles in the list below have been styled using the common English equivalent. Roman numerals, used to distinguish related rulers with the same name, have been applied where typical.\n\nIn political and sociocultural studies, monarchies are normally associated with hereditary rule; most monarchs, in both historical and contemporary contexts, have been born and raised within a royal family. Succession has been defined using a variety of distinct formulae, such as proximity of blood, primogeniture, and agnatic seniority. Some monarchies, however, are not hereditary, and the ruler is instead determined through an elective process; a modern example is the throne of Malaysia. These systems defy the model concept of a monarchy, but are commonly considered as such because they retain certain associative characteristics. Many systems use a combination of hereditary and elective elements, where the election or nomination of a successor is restricted to members of a royal bloodline.\n\nEntries below are listed beside their respective dominions, which are organised alphabetically.

It involves the use of white makeup or face paint to create a mask-like effect on the face, often accompanied by exaggerated facial expressions and movements. The term \"whiteface\" is often used in contrast to \"blackface,\" which is a controversial practice that involves a white person darkening their skin to portray stereotypical caricatures of black people. In clowning, whiteface makeup is used to create a clean, polished look. The makeup typically covers the entire face, including the eyebrows and lips, and is often paired with brightly colored wigs and costumes. The exaggerated facial expressions and movements associated with clowning are meant to be comical and entertaining, and the whiteface makeup helps to enhance these expressions and create a heightened sense of playfulness and joy. Whiteface makeup is also commonly used in mime performances, where the focus is on non-verbal communication and visual storytelling. The stark white makeup creates a blank canvas on which facial expressions and movements can be more easily perceived by the audience. In other performing arts, such as opera and ballet, whiteface makeup is often used to create a stylized, otherworldly look for characters. Like many makeup techniques in the performing arts, the use of whiteface has evolved over time and has been adapted for different styles and performances. While it has a long history in theater and performing arts, the practice of using whiteface makeup is not without controversy. Criticisms include accusations of cultural appropriation and insensitivity to certain groups. Despite the controversy surrounding whiteface, it continues to be used in theatrical performances and other arts, particularly in the clowning and mime communities. The use of whiteface makeup is a key component in creating visually striking and memorable characters that entertain and delight audiences.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 31134678}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad Co.\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad Company, 118 U.S. 394 (1886), is a corporate law case of the United States Supreme Court concerning taxation of railroad properties. The case is most notable for a headnote stating that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment grants constitutional protections to corporations.\n\nThe case arose when several railroads refused to follow a California state law that gave less favorable tax treatment to some assets owned by corporations as compared to assets owned by individuals. The Court's opinions in earlier cases such as Dartmouth College v. Woodward had recognized that corporations were entitled to some of the protections of the Constitution. Associate Justice John Marshall Harlan's majority opinion held for the railroads, but his opinion did not address the Equal Protection Clause. However, a headnote written by the Reporter of Decisions and approved by Chief Justice Morrison Waite stated that the Supreme Court justices unanimously believed that the Equal Protection Clause did grant constitutional protections to corporations. The headnote marked the first occasion on which the Supreme Court indicated that the Equal Protection Clause granted constitutional protections to corporations as well as to natural persons.\n\nFacts\nAt the California Constitutional Convention of 1878\u201379, the state legislature drew up a new constitution that denied railroads \"the right to deduct the amount of their debts [i.e., mortgages] from the taxable value of their property, a right which was given to individuals.\" Southern Pacific Railroad Company refused to pay taxes under these new changes. The taxpaying railroads challenged this law, based on a conflicting federal statute of 1866 which gave them privileges inconsistent with state taxation (14 Stat. 292, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, 3, 11, 18).\n\nSan Mateo County, along with neighboring counties, filed suit against the railroads to recoup the massive losses in tax revenue stemming from Southern Pacific's refusal to pay. After hearing arguments in San Mateo County v. Southern Pacific Railroad Company, the California Supreme Court sided with the county.\n\nThe Supreme Court of the United States issued an opinion consolidating three separate cases: Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad Company, California v. Central Pacific Railroad Company, and California v. Southern Pacific Railroad Company.\n\nHeadnote\n\nThe headnote, which is \"not the work of the Court, but is simply the work of the Reporter, giving his understanding of the decision, prepared for the convenience of the profession\", was written by the Reporter of Decisions, former president of the Newburgh and New York Railway Company J.C. Bancroft Davis. He said the following:\n\nOne of the points made and discussed at length in the brief of counsel for defendants in error was that 'corporations are persons within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.' Before argument, Mr. Chief Justice Waite said: The court does not wish to hear argument on the question whether the provision in the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which forbids a State to deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws, applies to these corporations. We are all of the opinion that it does.\n\nSo the headnote was a reporting by the Reporter of Decisions of the Chief Justice's interpretation of the Justices' opinions. But the issue of applicability of \"Equal Protection to any persons\" to the railroads was not addressed in the decision of the Court in the case.\n\nBefore publication in United States Reports, Davis wrote a letter to Chief Justice Morrison Waite, dated May 26, 1886, to make sure his headnote was correct:\n\nDear Chief Justice,\n\nI have a memorandum in the California Cases Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific &c\nAs follows. In opening the Court stated that it did not wish to hear argument on the question whether the Fourteenth Amendment applies to such corporations as are parties in these suits. All the Judges were of the opinion that it does.\n\nWaite replied:\n\nI think your mem. in the California Railroad Tax cases expresses with sufficient accuracy what was said before the argument began. I leave it with you to determine whether anything need be said about it in the report inasmuch as we avoided meeting the constitutional question in the decision.\n\nC. Peter Magrath, who discovered the exchange while researching Morrison R. Waite: The Triumph of Character, writes \"In other words, to the Reporter fell the decision which enshrined the declaration in the United States Reports...had Davis left it out, Santa Clara County v. Southern Pac. R. Co. would have been lost to history among thousands of uninteresting tax cases.\" At the same time, the correspondence makes clear that the headnote does reflect the Court's thinking, at least before hearing any arguments to the contrary.\n\nAuthor Jack Beatty wrote about the lingering questions as to how the reporter's note reflected a quotation that was absent from the opinion itself.\nWhy did the chief justice issue his dictum? Why did he leave it up to Davis to include it in the headnotes? After Waite told him that the Court 'avoided' the issue of corporate personhood, why did Davis include it? Why, indeed, did he begin his headnote with it? The opinion made plain that the Court did not decide the corporate personality issue and the subsidiary equal protection issue.\n\nDefense argument\nWhile the decision of the Court did not rest on the Fourteenth Amendment, an argument on this ground had been delivered by the defense:\n\nThat the provisions of the Constitution and laws of California in respect to the assessment for taxation of the property of railway corporations operating railroads in more than one county, are in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution insofar as they require the assessment of their property at its full money value without making deduction, as in the case of railroads operated in one county and of other corporations and of natural persons, for the value of the mortgages covering the property assessed, thus imposing upon the defendant unequal burdens, and to that extent denying to it the equal protection of the laws.\n\nJudgment\nA unanimous decision, written by Justice Harlan, ruled on the matter of fences, holding that the state of California illegally included the fences running beside the tracks in its assessment of the total value of the railroad's property. As a result, the county could not collect taxes from Southern Pacific that it was not allowed to collect in the first place. This meant that the more significant question of the Equal Protection Clause was never actually addressed.\n\nSignificance\nThus the Supreme Court's actual decision never hinged on the equal protection claims. Nevertheless, the case has been allowed to have clear constitutional consequences, as it has been subsequently cited as affirming the protection of corporations under the Fourteenth Amendment. At the very least, this is an unusual exception to the normal understanding of the workings of the Court's rule of stare decisis \u2013 the reliance on precedent. It is an instance in which a statement which is neither part of the ruling of the Court, nor part of the opinion of a majority or dissenting minority of the Court has been cited as precedent in subsequent decisions of the Court.\n\nIn his dissent in the 1938 case of Connecticut General Life Insurance Company v. Johnson, Justice Hugo Black wrote \nin 1886, this Court in the case of Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad, decided for the first time that the word 'person' in the amendment did in some instances include corporations. [...] The history of the amendment proves that the people were told that its purpose was to protect weak and helpless human beings and were not told that it was intended to remove corporations in any fashion from the control of state governments. [...] The language of the amendment itself does not support the theory that it was passed for the benefit of corporations.\n\nJustice William O. Douglas wrote in 1949, \nthe Santa Clara case becomes one of the most momentous of all our decisions. [...] Corporations were now armed with constitutional prerogatives.\n\nSee also\n\nUnited States corporate law\nCorporate personhood\nJuristic person\nJohnson v.

Southern Pacific Railroad Co. was a landmark case in United States corporate law that set the stage for corporate personhood. The case took place in 1886 in the Supreme Court of the United States and centered around whether the Southern Pacific Railroad Company should be subject to the same property tax rates as individuals in Santa Clara County, California. The case began in 1876 when the county assessed the railroad's property and found that it had failed to pay the appropriate amount of taxes. The county sued the railroad in state court, and the case eventually made its way to the Supreme Court. In a 5-4 decision, the Court ruled that the corporation was a person under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, which provides equal protection under the law for all persons. Although the decision did not explicitly grant corporations personhood, it set the precedent for such an interpretation. This has been a controversial decision in corporate law history, with some arguing that the decision undermines the democratic process by giving corporations the same rights as individuals. Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad Co. also had implications for the regulation of corporations. By granting corporations the same legal rights as individual persons, it allowed corporations greater freedom to engage in political lobbying, campaign donations, and other forms of political influence. This has led to concerns about the role of corporations in modern democracy and sparked efforts to limit the influence of corporate money in politics. Overall, Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad Co. was a pivotal case that shaped modern corporate law and continues to be debated to this day.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 169032}

Incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator Wendell Anderson was defeated by Republican challenger Rudy Boschwitz.\n\nThe \"Minnesota Massacre\"\nIn 1978, Minnesota's top three statewide offices were all up for election: the governorship and both U.S. Senate seats. But there was a particular oddity to the races: the incumbents, each a member of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, were all appointed to their offices, not elected. (Republicans took advantage of this, putting up billboards that read, \"The DFL is going to face something scary \u2014 an election\".)\n\nFirst, after Walter Mondale was elected Vice President in 1976, sitting Governor Wendell Anderson resigned so that Lieutenant Governor Rudy Perpich, as the new governor, could appoint Anderson to the open seat. This did not sit well with the electorate. Then, in January 1978, Minnesota's other Senate seat opened up when Hubert Humphrey died; Perpich appointed Humphrey's widow, Muriel, to the office. But she did not want to run that fall, and the DFL nominated Bob Short for the post.\n\nThough Democrats maintained large majorities in both the U.S. House and Senate, the November election was something of a disappointment for them, as they lost a handful of seats in both chambers. But for Minnesota's DFL it was a disaster, later dubbed the \"Minnesota Massacre\". Plywood magnate Rudy Boschwitz campaigned as a liberal Republican, freely spent his own money, and defeated Anderson by 16 points, while David Durenberger crushed Short by 26 points. Al Quie completed the Republican trifecta by downing Perpich 52% to 45%. (Perpich would be reelected governor in 1982 and 1986.)\n\nThe results in Minnesota marked the first time the GOP had held all three offices since Joseph H. Ball left the Senate in January 1949.

Incumbent Democratic Senator Wendell Anderson did not seek re-election, instead opting to run for governor of Minnesota. This created an open seat that would be contested between Republican nominee David Durenberger and Democratic nominee Bob Short. David Durenberger, a former state senator, secured the Republican nomination after a closely contested primary race. Meanwhile, Bob Short, a businessman and former owner of the Minnesota North Stars hockey team, won the Democratic nomination unopposed. The election was closely watched by both parties, as it was seen as a key opportunity for Republicans to gain a foothold in the traditionally Democratic-leaning state. The campaign was marked by fierce debates over issues such as healthcare, taxes, and government spending. Durenberger ran on a platform that emphasized fiscal responsibility and a smaller government, while Short emphasized his background as a successful businessman and his commitment to expanding access to healthcare. On Election Day, Durenberger emerged victorious, defeating Short by a margin of 53% to 47%. Durenberger's victory was seen as a significant upset, as he had been considered a long shot candidate for much of the race. Durenberger would go on to serve three terms in the United States Senate, gaining a reputation as a moderate Republican who was willing to work with members of both parties to pass legislation. He retired from the Senate in 1995, citing health concerns. The 1978 United States Senate election in Minnesota was viewed as a turning point in the state's political history, as it signaled a shift towards more competitive electoral contests and a growing Republican presence in the state's political landscape.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 40190471}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Rhinoceros auklet\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The rhinoceros auklet (Cerorhinca monocerata) is a seabird and a close relative of the puffins. It is the only extant species of the genus Cerorhinca. Given its close relationship with the puffins, the common name rhinoceros puffin has been proposed for the species.\n\nIt ranges widely across the North Pacific, feeding on small fish and nesting in colonies. Its name is derived from a horn-like extension of the beak (the anatomic term for this extension is the rhamphotheca). This horn is only present in breeding adults, and like the elaborate sheath on the bill of puffins is shed every year. This horn also processes fluorescent properties, which is likely involved in reproductive signalling.\n\nThe rhinoceros auklet (also known as the rhino auklet, horn-billed puffin, or unicorn puffin), is a medium-sized auk with a large, strong, orange/brown bill (with the 'horn' protruding from it). The plumage is dark on top and paler below; breeding adults (both male and female) possess white plumes above the eyes and behind the bill. Males are slightly larger than females (about 10% in mass).\n\nDistribution\nThe rhinoceros auklet is a North Pacific auk that breeds from California (the Channel Islands) to the Aleutian Islands in Alaska in North America; and Hokkaid\u014d and Honsh\u016b, Japan, as well as the Korean Peninsula and Sakhalin Island in Asia. It winters both in offshore and inshore waters, exhibiting some migration. Between October and April, migration of a large number occurs on pelagic California waters, most coming from breeding colonies north of California. Auks that reside off the California coast remain in their areas.\n\nBreeding\nBreeding occurs in the early summer months, ranging from May to June. The auklet nests in burrows dug into the soil, or in natural caves and cavities between 1 and 5 m deep. It prefers nesting sites on slight inclines to aid take-off, as it is a poor flier. A single egg is incubated by both parents for 30\u201335 days. The semiprecocial chick is then fed each night with a bill full of fish (in the manner of puffins) for 35\u201345 days. This nocturnal behaviour is believed to be a response to predation and kleptoparasitism by gulls.\n\nRhinoceros Auklets are monogamous, and although they migrate across similar areas during the non-breeding season, pair-mates migrate separately. However, they do synchronize their foraging activity once they return to the colony during the pre-laying period.\n\nFeeding\nAt sea, rhinoceros auklets feed on fish, with some krill and squid taken also. They feed inshore during the breeding season in the midwater.  To catch their prey, they dive as deep as 57 meters (187\u00a0ft) for as long as 148 seconds.\n\nDiet studies of nesting rhinoceros auklets show that their diet is variable depending on the location of the bird's nest. At one island located near the Salish Sea off of the Washington coast, auklets feed mainly on sand lance, while at a separate island also off of the Washington coast, auklets feed on anchovy and smelt.\n\nEvolution and prehistoric species\nThe genus Cerorhinca evolved in the North Pacific, apparently in the mid-late Miocene. Although today only one species remains, it used to be much more diverse, both in number of species and in distribution. Fossils have been found as far south as Baja California. The first record of the clade from the Atlantic Ocean was reported by Smith et al. (2007) and suggests that the biogeographic history of Cerorhinca is more complex than previously thought. Known prehistoric species are:\n\n Dubious auklet, Cerorhinca dubia L. H. Miller, 1925 (Late Miocene of San Barbara County, USA)\n Cerorhinca minor Howard, 1971 (Late Miocene/Early Pliocene of Cedros Island, Mexico)\n Cerorhinca reai Chandler, 1990 (San Diego Late Pliocene, North American Southwest)\n Cerorhinca aurorensis N. A. Smith, 2011, a nomen nudum, only published in a PhD dissertation (Yorktown Formation Late Pliocene, North Carolina, USA)\n Cerorhinca sp. (Early Pliocene, Southeastern Woodlands)\n\nBill fluorescence \nSince rhinoceros auklets are monogamous and highly social, the species depend heavily on physical characteristics of the other species in order to choose a lifetime mate. The prominent horn on the bill of breeding rhinoceros auklet is one evolutionary byproduct of this behavior. Also, the bill interestingly has fluorescent characteristics when viewed under ultraviolet light. Several bird species are able to detect cues through UV light, which supports the claim that this fluorescence is also meant for breeding purposes. While the upper and lower mandible give off fluorescence as well, this phenomenon is most prominent in the horn. There is no evidence for disparity of fluorescence between sexes, however, the amount of fluorescence does vary between individual auks.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Rhinoceros Auklet Images http://tsuru-bird.net/image.htm \u2013 Monte M.

They are part of the auk family and are known for their unique appearance, which includes a horn-like protuberance on their bill. Description and Characteristics The Rhinoceros auklet is a medium-sized bird, measuring approximately 40 centimeters in length and weighing around 600 grams. It has a distinctive appearance and is easily identified by the horn-like protuberance on its bill, which is used during the breeding season for courtship displays and aggressive behavior. The bird has a black back and wings and a white belly, with white facial feathers surrounding the bill. Habitat and Behavior Rhinoceros auklets are seabirds and are found in the North Pacific, including the waters off the coasts of Alaska, Canada, and Japan. They breed on rocky islands and coastal cliffs during the summer months and spend the rest of the year in the open ocean. The birds mate for life and return to their breeding grounds each year. During the breeding season, Rhinoceros auklets lay a single egg, which they incubate for around 40 days. Both parents share the incubation duties, and after hatching, the chick is fed a diet of fish and other marine invertebrates. The young bird can fly after around 50 days and become independent after around 70 days. Conservation Status The Rhinoceros auklet is classified as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However, habitat degradation and climate change are potential threats to the bird's population. Additionally, the bird is sometimes caught as bycatch in fishing nets, which can also impact its numbers. Conclusion The Rhinoceros auklet is a unique and fascinating seabird found in the North Pacific. It is easily identified by its horn-like protuberance on its bill and is known for its distinctive behavior during the breeding season. While it faces some potential threats, the bird is currently considered to be of least concern by the IUCN.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1317988}

It was originally a terminus; the line was extended through the station only a few years after it opened, to connect with the Great Northern Railway just to the east of that company's Lincoln Central station. The Durham Ox Junction was also crossed by a road, leading to many delays. The junction was crossed by Pelham Bridge in the mid-1950s. Until its closure St. Marks was the mainline station, with through services from Cleethorpes to London King's Cross. Prior to closure of the Lincoln-to-Grantham line during the Beeching Axe, London services had used Lincoln Central.\n\nTo avoid unnecessarily operating two stations, St Marks closed in 1985; services were diverted to the nearby Lincoln Central. The construction of a new 80-metre length of track to the west allowed services from Newark Castle station to reach Lincoln Central. The grand ionic portico that was once the entrance has been preserved and, as of January 2007, was home to Lakeland Limited as part of the commercial development of the site. A mock signalbox has also been erected in the car park on which has been affixed an original sign from the station. The remainder of the former station site is now St. Marks Shopping Centre. The redevelopment, in keeping with the preserved buildings, won an Ian Allan Heritage Award in 2009, which is commemorated by a plaque.\n\nStationmasters\nFrom 1934 the position of station master was merged with that of the LNER station and E.O.

PAICV ruled both the countries after independence. While international funds came pouring in for the economic development of the nation, the party was accused of misusing power in authoritarian manner. The one-party state mechanism was turbulent during the period of 1980s and 1990s with army taking control of power more frequently and the resultant civil war resulted in loss of property and lives. To decentralize power, an administrative region and eight regions were created.

In the wake of the Great Depression, Schram helped restore confidence in investment and stocks. Before his appointment, Schram did not own any stocks and had never been a Wall Street trader, making him the first outsider to become president of the exchange in 155 years.\n\nEarly life\nSchram was born in Peru, Indiana where he attended local schools through high-school. He was accepted into Harvard and Wharton, but couldn't afford tuition. Instead, he went to work in a timber and coal company with local offices. At age 21 he proved himself to be an effective farm manager, making investment decisions that dramatically increased the output of a local farm under the firms control.,\n\nCareer\nSchram's early success in farm management led him accept a position as chairman of the National Drainage Association, an agricultural trade group. While working for the Association, Schram applied for loans with the Reconstruction Finance Corporation which was a Depression/New Deal era government corporation tasked with making loans to infrastructure projects and businesses and helping banks resume normal operations.\n\nIn 1933, Schram joined the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. In 1939 he became the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the RFC. His chairmanship was short lived, however, because less than two years later he was offered the position that would define his career.\n\nIn 1941 the New York Stock Exchange was still feeling the effects of the Great Depression. Trade volume was very low, seats were sold cheaper than in previous decades, and the exchange had been the target of political attacks. A selection committee was formed to find a new president, and they selected Schram.  Before his appointment, Schram did not own any stocks and had never been a Wall Street trader, making him the first outsider to become president of the exchange in 155 years.\n\nSchram reformed the management structure of the Exchange, removing many of the traditional committees in favor of a top-town approach. He spent $500,000 per year on nationwide advertising programs encouraging the public to hold on to war bonds in an effort to keep small-time investors out of the market. Under Schram's leadership, the NYSE recovered, and public confidence was restored.\n\nLater career\nIn 1951, at age 58, Schram retired from the Exchange and returned home to Peru, Indiana. Schram was succeeded by G. Keith Funston. \nIn his later life he remained active in civic organizations including the local council of the Boy Scouts of America and the U.S.O.\n\nPersonal life\nEmil Schram's first wife was Mabel Miller, with whom he had three sons, Robert Schram, Daniel Schram, and James Schram. Mabel died in 1969, and Schram later married Margaret Beauchamp.\n\nSchram died in 1987 in Peru, Indiana.\n\nHonors\n\nIn 1968, Emil Schram was awarded an honorary doctorate from Indiana University, Bloomington.\n\nReferences\n\n1893 births\n1987 deaths\nPresidents of the New York Stock Exchange", "machine_text": "Emil Schram (1893-1987) was a German-American chemist and inventor who made significant contributions to the fields of industrial chemistry, synthetic rubber, and fuel additives. Born in Ludwigshafen, Germany, Schram studied chemistry at the University of Heidelberg before earning his doctorate in organic chemistry from the University of Stuttgart in 1920. After completing his studies, Schram worked for several chemical companies in Germany before emigrating to the United States in 1929 to work for the B.F. Goodrich Company in Akron, Ohio. There, he developed a method for synthesizing butadiene, a key ingredient in the production of synthetic rubber. This breakthrough helped to support the Allied war effort during World War II and was crucial in establishing the rubber industry in the United States. In addition to his work on synthetic rubber, Schram was also instrumental in the development of fuel additives that improve gasoline performance and reduce engine emissions. He was the co-inventor of tetraethyllead, a controversial gasoline additive that was banned in the United States in the 1970s due to health and environmental concerns. Despite these controversies, Schram was widely respected as a talented and innovative chemist. He was awarded more than 300 patents over the course of his career and was elected to the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 1977. In recognition of his contributions to the chemical industry, Schram was also honored with the Priestley Medal, the highest award in American chemistry, in 1979.

It is a plant pathogen that causes severe damage to several crops such as cucurbits, peppers, beans, and others. This fungus belongs to the fungal family Blastocladiaceae, and is an obligate fungal parasite. The pathogen primarily infects young plants and its spores can spread through wind or water. Upon infection, the fungus causes water-soaked patches on the leaves and fruit, leading to the death of the plant. The disease caused by this fungus can significantly reduce the yield, which has been a cause of concern for farmers across the world. Choanephora cucurbitarum can be identified on the basis of its unique morphology. The fruiting body of this fungus is spherical in shape with an irregularly lobed surface. It is pale yellow and can vary in size from 0.5 to 2 mm in diameter. The spores produced by this fungus are oval in shape and brown in color. They are covered with a distinctive spiny ornamentation. Research has shown that limited genetic and phenotypic diversity is present within the populations of Choanephora cucurbitarum across the world. Hence, control measures for this pathogen are limited. However, farmers can take preventive measures such as crop rotation, the use of disease-free seeds, and the pruning of infected plant parts. Despite the limitations in control measures, research on Choanephora cucurbitarum has continued to help develop a better understanding of this pathogen's biology, epidemiology, and pathogenicity. This research has led to the discovery of mechanisms that facilitate the infection process and the spread of the disease. Furthermore, it has led to the development of molecular markers that will help monitor the pathogen and its genetic diversity. Choanephora cucurbitarum remains a formidable pathogen, especially due to its high economic impact on agriculture. However, continued research will eventually lead to more effective control measures and ultimately, better yield protection for farmers.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 11322437}

They founded the Salvador Dal\u00ed Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida.\n\nEarly life and education\nReynolds Morse was born in Denver, Colorado to Bradish P. and Anna Morse. His father ran the specialist mining and machinery concern, Morse Brothers Machinery Company. His mother was the daughter of pioneer Albert Eugene Reynolds.\n\nReynolds Morse graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Colorado at Boulder. He then took an MBA at the Harvard Business School. For a decade after his MBA, Reynolds worked in industry before starting his own firm, Injection Molders Supply Company in 1949.\n\nReese Morse was the daughter of Cleveland pharmaceuticals manufacturer George Reese. After graduating from the Hathaway Brown School, she earned a bachelor's degree in music from Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida in 1937. She was initiated into the Florida Gamma chapter of Pi Beta Phi chapter at Rollins College.\n\nOccupational life\nReynolds Morse had many business, writing and collecting interests in addition to the collection of Salvador Dal\u00ed's paintings which he and Reese Morse built up and to running Injection Molders Supply Company. For instance, he published \"Injection Molding News\"; added to the rock collection of the Denver Natural History Museum where he was a trustee, and he collected George Elbert Burr manuscript materials which he donated to the Denver Public Library.\n\nReynolds Morse also authored George Elbert Burr: Etcher of the American West and published an anthology of his own, which he called Some Fifty Unprofessional Poems, as well as Gold Links Tailings in memory of his maternal grandfather. Reynolds Morse collected and wrote about the works of M. P. Shiel. Reynolds' The Works of M. P. Shiel was published in 1948; he later turned this work into a four-tome set and added The Quest for Redonda and The New King. In 1989 Reynolds donated his Shiel collection to Olin Library at Rollins College.\n\nThe Morses' diligent collecting and their friendship with Gala and Salvador Dal\u00ed produced a valuable art collection that is now housed in the Salvador Dal\u00ed Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida.

Over time, becoming patrons of Dal\u00ed, the Morses acquired works by Dal\u00ed which they found both captivating and intriguing. Their absorption by the artist's work led Reynolds to author numerous studies of Dal\u00ed and his \u0153uvre and Eleanor to translate from French to English numerous books about Dal\u00ed and his \u0153uvre. In 1969, the Morses purchased The Hallucinogenic Toreador, before it was completed.\n\nFrom 1971 to 1980, the Morses' considerable Dal\u00ed collection was on show in Beachwood, Ohio at the Salvador Dal\u00ed Museum, which was established there in a wing of their business premises. During that time the collection grew and required larger accommodation.\n\nThe Morses began the search for a new, permanent home for their collection. After seeing an article in the Wall Street Journal, \"U.S. Art World Dillydallies over Dal\u00ed\", St. Petersburg attorney James W. Martin persuaded local leaders to approach the Morses to choose St. Petersburg. With the financial support of the City of St. Petersburg and the State of Florida, the collection was housed in the Salvador Dal\u00ed Museum, formerly a warehouse on the waterfront, which opened in March 1982. A new, larger and more storm-secure museum near the current one, opened in 1-11-11 (at 11:11 am). \n\"Sharing their knowledge and understanding of Salvador Dal\u00ed and his art has been a lifelong mission for this dedicated couple.\"\n\nPersonal life\nThe Morses married in 1943.

The longest-lived isomer is 251mNo with a half-life of 1.7 seconds.\n\nList of isotopes \n\n|-\n| rowspan=2|249No\n| rowspan=2 style=\"text-align:right\" | 102\n| rowspan=2 style=\"text-align:right\" | 147\n| rowspan=2|249.0878(3)#\n| rowspan=2|43.8(3.7) ms\n| \u03b1 \n| 245Fm\n| rowspan=2|5/2+#\n|-\n| SF?\n| (various)\n|-\n| rowspan=3|250No\n| rowspan=3 style=\"text-align:right\" | 102\n| rowspan=3 style=\"text-align:right\" | 148\n| rowspan=3|250.08756(22)#\n| rowspan=3|5.7(8)\u00a0\u03bcs\n| SF (99.95%)\n| (various)\n| rowspan=3|0+\n|-\n| \u03b1(.05%)\n| 246Fm\n|-\n| \u03b2+ (2.5\u00d710\u22124%)\n| 250Md\n|-\n| style=\"text-indent:1em\" | 250mNo\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-indent:2em\" | \n| 36(3)\u00a0\u03bcs\n| SF\n| (various)\n| \n|-\n| rowspan=3|251No\n| rowspan=3 style=\"text-align:right\" | 102\n| rowspan=3 style=\"text-align:right\" | 149\n| rowspan=3|251.08894(12)#\n| rowspan=3|0.78(2)\u00a0s\n| \u03b1 (89%)\n| 247Fm\n| rowspan=3|7/2+#\n|-\n| SF (10%)\n| (various)\n|-\n| \u03b2+ (1%)\n| 251Md\n|-\n| style=\"text-indent:1em\" | 251mNo\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-indent:2em\" | 110(180)#\u00a0keV\n| 1.7(10)\u00a0s\n|\n|\n| 9/2\u2212#\n|-\n| rowspan=3|252No\n| rowspan=3 style=\"text-align:right\" | 102\n| rowspan=3 style=\"text-align:right\" | 150\n| rowspan=3|252.088967(10)\n| rowspan=3|2.27(14)\u00a0s\n| \u03b1 (73.09%)\n| 248Fm\n| rowspan=3|0+\n|-\n| SF (26.9%)\n| (various)\n|-\n| \u03b2+ (1%)\n| 252Md\n\n|-\n| rowspan=3|253No\n| rowspan=3 style=\"text-align:right\" | 102\n| rowspan=3 style=\"text-align:right\" | 151\n| rowspan=3|253.090564(7)\n| rowspan=3|1.62(15)\u00a0min\n| \u03b1 (80%)\n| 249Fm\n| rowspan=3|(9/2\u2212)#\n|-\n| \u03b2+ (20%)\n| 253Md\n|-\n| SF (10\u22123%)\n| (various)\n|-\n| style=\"text-indent:1em\" | 253mNo\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-indent:2em\" | 129(19)\u00a0keV\n| 31\u00a0\u03bcs\n|\n|\n| 5/2+#\n|-\n| rowspan=3|254No\n| rowspan=3 style=\"text-align:right\" | 102\n| rowspan=3 style=\"text-align:right\" | 152\n| rowspan=3|254.090956(11)\n| rowspan=3|51(10)\u00a0s\n| \u03b1 (89.3%)\n| 250Fm\n| rowspan=3|0+\n|-\n| \u03b2+ (10%)\n| 254Md\n|-\n| SF (.31%)\n| (various)\n|-\n| rowspan=2 style=\"text-indent:1em\" | 254mNo\n| rowspan=2 colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-indent:2em\" | 500(100)#\u00a0keV\n| rowspan=2|0.28(4)\u00a0s\n| IT (80%)\n| 254No\n| rowspan=2|0+\n|-\n| \u03b1 (20%)\n| 250Fm\n|-\n| rowspan=2|255No\n| rowspan=2 style=\"text-align:right\" | 102\n| rowspan=2 style=\"text-align:right\" | 153\n| rowspan=2|255.093191(16)\n| rowspan=2|3.1(2)\u00a0min\n| \u03b1 (61.4%)\n| 251Fm\n| rowspan=2|(1/2+)\n|-\n| \u03b2+ (38.6%)\n| 255Md\n|-\n| rowspan=3|256No\n| rowspan=3 style=\"text-align:right\" | 102\n| rowspan=3 style=\"text-align:right\" | 154\n| rowspan=3|256.094283(8)\n| rowspan=3|2.91(5)\u00a0s\n| \u03b1 (99.44%)\n| 252Fm\n| rowspan=3|0+\n|-\n| SF (.55%)\n| (various)\n|-\n| EC (.01%)\n| 256Md\n|-\n| rowspan=2|257No\n| rowspan=2 style=\"text-align:right\" | 102\n| rowspan=2 style=\"text-align:right\" | 155\n| rowspan=2|257.096888(7)\n| rowspan=2|25(2)\u00a0s\n| \u03b1 (99%)\n| 253Fm\n| rowspan=2|(7/2+)\n|-\n| \u03b2+ (1%)\n| 257Md\n|-\n| rowspan=3|258No\n| rowspan=3 style=\"text-align:right\" | 102\n| rowspan=3 style=\"text-align:right\" | 156\n| rowspan=3|258.09821(11)#\n| rowspan=3|1.2(2)\u00a0ms\n| SF (99.99%)\n| (various)\n| rowspan=3|0+\n|-\n| \u03b1 (.01%)\n| 254Fm\n|-\n| \u03b2+\u03b2+ (rare)\n| 258Fm\n|-\n| rowspan=3|259No\n| rowspan=3 style=\"text-align:right\" | 102\n| rowspan=3 style=\"text-align:right\" | 157\n| rowspan=3|259.10103(11)#\n| rowspan=3|58(5)\u00a0min\n| \u03b1 (75%)\n| 255Fm\n| rowspan=3|(9/2+)#\n|-\n| EC (25%)\n| 259Md\n|-\n| SF (<10%)\n| (various)\n|-\n| 260No\n| style=\"text-align:right\" | 102\n| style=\"text-align:right\" | 158\n| 260.10264(22)#\n| 106(8)\u00a0ms\n| SF\n| (various)\n| 0+\n\n|-\n| 262No\n| style=\"text-align:right\" | 102\n| style=\"text-align:right\" | 160\n| 262.10746(39)#\n| ~5\u00a0ms\n| SF\n| (various)\n| 0+\n\nNucleosynthesis\n\nBy cold fusion\n208Pb(48Ca,xn)256\u2212xNo (x=1,2,3,4)\nThis cold fusion reaction was first studied in 1979 at the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions (FLNR). Further work in 1988 at the GSI measured EC and SF branchings in 254No. In 1989, the FLNR used the reaction to measure SF decay characteristics for the two isomers of 254No. The measurement of the 2n excitation function was reported in 2001 by Yuri Oganessian at the FLNR.\n\nPatin et al. at the LBNL reported in 2002 the synthesis of 255\u2013251No in the 1-4n exit channels and measured further decay data for these isotopes.\n\nThe reaction has recently been used at the Jyvaskylan Yliopisto Fysiikan Laitos (JYFL) using the RITU set-up to study K-isomerism in 254No. The scientists were able to measure two K-isomers with half-lives of 275\u00a0ms and 198\u00a0s, respectively. They were assigned to 8\u2212 and 16+ K-isomeric levels.\n\nThe reaction was used in 2004\u20135 at the FLNR to study the spectroscopy of 255\u2013253No. The team were able to confirm an isomeric level in 253No with a half-life of 43.5\u00a0s.\n\n208Pb(44Ca,xn)252\u2212xNo (x=2)\nThis reaction was studied in 2003 at the FLNR in a study of the spectroscopy of 250No.\n\n207Pb(48Ca,xn)255\u2212xNo (x=2)\nThe measurement of the 2n excitation function for this reaction was reported in 2001 by Yuri Oganessian and co-workers at the FLNR. The reaction was used in 2004\u20135 to study the spectroscopy of 253No.\n\n206Pb(48Ca,xn)254\u2212xNo (x=1,2,3,4)\nThe measurement of the 1-4n excitation functions for this reaction were reported in 2001 by Yuri Oganessian and co-workers at the FLNR.\nThe 2n channel was further studied by the GSI to provide a spectroscopic determination of K-isomerism in 252No. A K-isomer with spin and parity 8\u2212 was detected with a half-life of 110\u00a0ms.\n\n204Pb(48Ca,xn)252\u2212xNo (x=2,3)\nThe measurement of the 2n excitation function for this reaction was reported in 2001 by Yuri Oganessian at the FLNR. They reported a new isotope 250No with a half-life of 36\u00a0\u03bcs. The reaction was used in 2003 to study the spectroscopy of 250No.They were able to observe two spontaneous fission activities with half-lives of 5.6\u00a0\u03bcs and 54\u00a0\u03bcs and assigned to 250No and 249No, respectively.\nThe latter activity was later assigned to a K-isomer in 250No. The reaction was reported in 2006 by Peterson et al. at the Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) in a study of SF in 250No. They detected two activities with half-lives of 3.7\u00a0\u00a0\u03bcs and 43\u00a0\u00a0\u03bcs and both assigned to 250No, the latter associated with a K-isomer. In 2020, a team at FLNR repeated this reaction and found a new 9.1-MeV alpha particle activity correlated to 245Fm and 241Cf, which they assigned to the new isotope 249No.\n\nBy hot fusion\n232Th(26Mg,xn)258\u2212xNo (x=4,5,6)\nThe cross sections for the 4-6n exit channels have been measured for this reaction at the FLNR.\n\n238U(22Ne,xn)260\u2212xNo (x=4,5,6)\nThis reaction was first studied in 1964 at the FLNR. The team were able to detect decays from 252Fm and 250Fm. The 252Fm activity was associated with an ~8\u00a0s half-life and assigned to 256102 from the 4n channel, with a yield of 45\u00a0nb.  \nThey were also able to detect a 10\u00a0s spontaneous fission activity also tentatively assigned to 256102.\nFurther work in 1966 on the reaction examined the detection of 250Fm decay using chemical separation and a parent activity with a half-life of ~50\u00a0s was reported and correctly assigned to 254102. They also detected a 10\u00a0s spontaneous fission activity tentatively assigned to 256102.\nThe reaction was used in 1969 to study some initial chemistry of nobelium at the FLNR. They determined eka-ytterbium properties, consistent with nobelium as the heavier homologue. In 1970, they were able to study the SF properties of 256No.\nIn 2002, Patin et al. reported the synthesis of 256No from the 4n channel but were unable to detect 257No.\n\nThe cross section values for the 4-6n channels have also been studied at the FLNR.\n\n238U(20Ne,xn)258\u2212xNo\nThis reaction was studied in 1964 at the FLNR. No spontaneous fission activities were observed.\n\n236U(22Ne,xn)258\u2212xNo (x=4,5,6)\nThe cross sections for the 4-6n exit channels have been measured for this reaction at the FLNR.\n\n235U(22Ne,xn)257\u2212xNo (x=5)\nThis reaction was studied in 1970 at the FLNR. It was used to study the SF decay properties of 252No.\n\n233U(22Ne,xn)255\u2212xNo\nThe synthesis of neutron deficient nobelium isotopes was studied in 1975 at the FLNR. In their experiments they observed a 250\u00a0s SF activity, which they tentatively assigned to 250No in the 5n exit channel. Later results have not been able to confirm this activity and it is currently unidentified.\n\n242Pu(18O,xn)260\u2212xNo (x=4?)\nThis reaction was studied in 1966 at the FLNR. The team identified an 8.2\u00a0s SF activity tentatively assigned to 256102.\n\n241Pu(16O,xn)257\u2212xNo\nThis reaction was first studied in 1958 at the FLNR. The team measured ~8.8\u00a0MeV alpha particles with a half-life of 30\u00a0s and assigned to 253,252,251102. A repeat in 1960 produced 8.9\u00a0MeV alpha particles with a half-life of 2\u201340\u00a0s and assigned to 253102 from the 4n channel. Confidence in these results was later diminished.\n\n239Pu(18O,xn)257\u2212xNo (x=5)\nThis reaction was studied in 1970 at the FLNR in an effort to study the SF decay properties of 252No.\n\n239Pu(16O,xn)255\u2212xNo\nThis reaction was first studied in 1958 at the FLNR. The team were able to measure ~8.8\u00a0MeV alpha particles with a half-life of 30\u00a0s and assigned to253,252,251102. A repeat in 1960 was unsuccessful and it was concluded the first results were probably associated with background effects.\n\n243Am(15N,xn)258\u2212xNo (x=4)\nThis reaction was studied in 1966 at the FLNR. The team were able to detect 250Fm using chemical techniques and determined an associated half-life significantly higher than the reported 3\u00a0s by Berkeley for the supposed parent 254No. Further work later the same year measured 8.1\u00a0MeV alpha particles with a half-life of 30\u201340\u00a0s.\n\n243Am(14N,xn)257\u2212xNo\nThis reaction was studied in 1966 at the FLNR. They were unable to detect the 8.1\u00a0MeV alpha particles detected when using a N-15 beam.\n\n241Am(15N,xn)256\u2212xNo (x=4)\nThe decay properties of 252No were examined in 1977 at Oak Ridge. The team calculated a half-life of 2.3\u00a0s and measured a 27% SF branching.\n\n248Cm(18O,\u03b1xn)262\u2212xNo (x=3)\nThe synthesis of the new isotope 259No was reported in 1973 from the LBNL using this reaction.\n\n248Cm(13C,xn)261\u2212xNo (x=3?,4,5)\nThis reaction was first studied in 1967 at the LBNL. The new isotopes 258No,257No and 256No were detected in the 3-5n channels. The reaction was repeated in 1970 to provide further decay data for 257No.\n\n248Cm(12C,xn)260\u2212xNo (4,5?)\nThis reaction was studied in 1967 at the LBNL in their seminal study of nobelium isotopes. The reaction was used in 1990 at the LBNL to study the SF of256No.\n\n246Cm(13C,xn)259\u2212xNo (4?,5?)\nThis reaction was studied in 1967 at the LBNL in their seminal study of nobelium isotopes.\n\n246Cm(12C,xn)258\u2212xNo (4,5)\nThis reaction was studied in 1958 by scientists at the LBNL using a 5% 246Cm curium target. They were able to measure 7.43\u00a0MeV decays from250Fm, associated with a 3\u00a0s 254No parent activity, resulting from the 4n channel. The 3\u00a0s activity was later reassigned to 252No, resulting from reaction with the predominant 244Cm component in the target. It could however not be proved that it was not due to the contaminant250mFm, unknown at the time.\nLater work in 1959 produced 8.3\u00a0MeV alpha particles with a half-life of 3\u00a0s and a 30% SF branch. This was initially assigned to 254No and later reassigned to 252No, resulting from reaction with the 244Cm component in the target.\nThe reaction was restudied in 1967 and activities assigned to 254No and 253No were detected.\n\n244Cm(13C,xn)257\u2212xNo (x=4)\nThis reaction was first studied in 1957 at the Nobel Institute in Stockholm. The scientists detected 8.5\u00a0MeV alpha particles with a half-life of 10 minutes. The activity was assigned to 251No or 253No. The results were later dismissed as background.\nThe reaction was repeated by scientists at the LBNL in 1958 but they were unable to confirm the 8.5\u00a0MeV alpha particles. \nThe reaction was further studied in 1967 at the LBNL and an activity assigned to 253No was measured.\n\n244Cm(12C,xn)256\u2212xNo (x=4,5)\nThis reaction was studied in 1958 by scientists at the LBNL using a 95% 244Cm curium target. They were able to measure 7.43\u00a0MeV decays from250Fm, associated with a 3\u00a0s 254No parent activity, resulting from the reaction (246Cm,4n). The 3\u00a0s activity was later reassigned to252No, resulting from reaction (244Cm,4n). It could however not be proved that it was not due to the contaminant 250mFm, unknown at the time.\nLater work in 1959 produced 8.3\u00a0MeV alpha particles with a half-life of 3\u00a0s and a 30% SF branch. This was initially assigned to 254No and later reassigned to 252No, resulting from reaction with the 244Cm component in the target.\nThe reaction was restudied in 1967 at the LBNL and a new activity assigned to 251No was measured.\n\n252Cf(12C,\u03b1xn)260\u2212xNo (x=3?)\nThis reaction was studied at the LBNL in 1961 as part of their search for element 104. They detected 8.2\u00a0MeV alpha particles with a half-life of 15\u00a0s. This activity was assigned to a Z=102 isotope. Later work suggests an assignment to 257No, resulting most likely from the \u03b13n channel with the 252Cf component of the californium target.\n\n252Cf(11B,pxn)262\u2212xNo (x=5?)\nThis reaction was studied at the LBNL in 1961 as part of their search for element 103. They detected 8.2\u00a0MeV alpha particles with a half-life of 15\u00a0s. This activity was assigned to a Z=102 isotope. Later work suggests an assignment to 257No, resulting most likely from the p5n channel with the 252Cf component of the californium target.\n\n249Cf(12C,\u03b1xn)257\u2212xNo (x=2)\nThis reaction was first studied in 1970 at the LBNL in a study of 255No. It was studied in 1971 at the Oak Ridge Laboratory. They were able to measure coincident Z=100 K X-rays from 255No, confirming the discovery of the element.\n\nAs decay products\nIsotopes of nobelium have also been identified in the decay of heavier elements. Observations to date are summarised in the table below:\n\nIsotopes\nTwelve radioisotopes of nobelium have been characterized, with the most stable being 259No with a half-life of 58 minutes. Longer half-lives are expected for the as-yet-unknown 261No and 263No. An isomeric level has been found in 253No and K-isomers have been found in 250No, 252No and 254No to date.\n\nChronology of isotope discovery\n\nNuclear isomerism\n254No\nThe study of K-isomerism was recently studied by physicists at the University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 physics laboratory (JYFL). They were able to confirm a previously reported K-isomer and detected a second K-isomer. They assigned spins and parities of 8\u2212 and 16+ to the two K-isomers.\n\n253No\nIn 1971, Bemis et al. was able to determine an isomeric level decaying with a half-life of 31\u00a0s from the decay of 257Rf. This was confirmed in 2003 at the GSI by also studying the decay of 257Rf. Further support in the same year from the FLNR appeared with a slightly higher half-life of 43.5\u00a0s, decaying by M2 gamma emission to the ground state.\n\n252No\nIn a recent study by the GSI into K-isomerism in even-even isotopes, a K-isomer with a half-life of 110\u00a0ms was detected for 252No. A spin and parity of 8\u2212 was assigned to the isomer.\n\n250No\nIn 2003, scientists at the FLNR reported that they had been able to synthesise 249No, which decayed by SF with a half-life of 54\u00a0\u03bcs. Further work in 2006 by scientists at the ANL showed that the activity was actually due to a K-isomer in 250No. The ground state isomer was also detected with a very short half-life of 3.7\u00a0\u03bcs.\n\nChemical yields of isotopes\n\nCold fusion\nThe table below provides cross-sections and excitation energies for cold fusion reactions producing nobelium isotopes directly. Data in bold represents maxima derived from excitation function measurements. + represents an observed exit channel.\n\nHot fusion\nThe table below provides cross-sections and excitation energies for hot fusion reactions producing nobelium isotopes directly. Data in bold represents maxima derived from excitation function measurements. + represents an observed exit channel.\n\nRetracted isotopes\nIn 2003, scientists at the FLNR claimed to have discovered 249No, which would have been the lightest known isotope of nobelium. However, subsequent work showed that the 54\u00a0s activity was actually due to 250No and the isotope 249No was retracted. The discovery of this isotope was later reported in 2020; its decay properties differed from the 2003 claims.\n\nReferences \n\n Isotope masses from:\n\n Isotopic compositions and standard atomic masses from:\n\n Half-life, spin, and isomer data selected from the following sources.\n\n \nNobelium\nNobelium", "machine_text": "Isotopes of Nobelium Nobelium is a synthetic element with the atomic number 102 and symbol No. It was first synthesized in 1957 by scientists in Sweden and named after Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite and founder of the Nobel Prize. As a highly unstable element, nobelium has no natural isotopes. All known isotopes of nobelium are synthetic and highly radioactive. There are fifteen known isotopes of nobelium, ranging from nobelium-249 to nobelium-263. All of these isotopes are highly unstable and rapidly decay through a series of alpha and beta particle emissions until they reach a stable isotope of another element. The half-lives of these isotopes range from just a few seconds to several hours. One of the most important isotopes of nobelium is nobelium-259, which has a half-life of approximately 58 minutes. This isotope can be produced by bombarding a target material with a beam of heavy ions and is used in the study of nuclear physics. Nobelium-259 is also used in the production of other synthetic elements. Another important isotopes of nobelium are nobelium-257 and nobelium-258. These isotopes have half-lives of approximately 25 minutes and 4.2 minutes, respectively. These isotopes have been used to study the chemical properties of nobelium and its compounds. The other isotopes of nobelium have very short half-lives and little is known about their chemical and physical properties. They are mainly used for scientific research purposes. In conclusion, nobelium is a synthetic element with no natural isotopes. All known isotopes of nobelium are highly radioactive, with short half-lives. These isotopes have been used in the study of nuclear physics and chemistry. Further research may reveal more about the chemical and physical properties of these isotopes of nobelium.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2527225}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Eugene de Kock\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Eugene Alexander de Kock (born 29 January 1949) is a former South African Police colonel, torturer, and assassin, active under the apartheid government. Nicknamed \"Prime Evil\" by the press, De Kock was the commanding officer of C10, a counter-insurgency unit of the SAP that kidnapped, tortured, and murdered numerous anti-apartheid activists from the 1980s to the early 1990s. C10's victims included members of the African National Congress.\n\nFollowing South Africa's transition to democracy in 1994, De Kock disclosed the full scope of C10's crimes while testifying before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. In 1996, he was tried and convicted on eighty-nine charges and sentenced to 212\u00a0years in prison. Since beginning his sentence, De Kock has accused several members of the apartheid government, including former State President F. W. de Klerk, of permitting C10's activities. In 2015, he was granted parole, and is currently released .\n\nEarly life and service\nEugene Alexander de Kock was born to Lourens Vosloo de Kock, a magistrate and personal friend to former prime minister John Vorster. Vosloo \"Vossie\" de Kock, Eugene's brother, later described him as a \"quiet\" boy who \"wasn't a violent person.\" He also recounted how their father, a member of the Afrikaner Broederbond, indoctrinated the boys in Afrikaner nationalist ideology and taught them \"strict Afrikaans\" as they grew up.\n\nDe Kock developed a long-time ambition of becoming an officer. In 1967, after finishing school, he performed his year-long national service in Pretoria at the Army Gymnasium. During this time, he and the rest of the Gymnasium's six companies were deployed to Rhodesia's border with Botswana to confront militant ANC incursions. De Kock graduated from the Gymnasium as an infantry soldier in the South African Defence Force. However, he decided not to attend the officers college in Saldanha Bay because of a stutter, and declined to pursue a B. Mil degree. He joined the South African Police's uniform branch in the Eastern Cape. \n\nDe Kock underwent off-duty training at Pretoria's Baviaanspoort Prison with members of the Security Police under Captain de Swart, in what later was to become the SAP's Special Task Force. In 1976, instead of accepting an invitation to train new Special Task Force members, De Kock reported to the Police College for an officers' course and was promoted from warrant officer to lieutenant.\n\nIn May 1978, De Kock was transferred to South West Africa and joined the security branch in Oshikati. In 1979, he co-founded Koevoet, an SAP counterinsurgency unit tasked with combating the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN) during the South African Border War. Koevoet was regarded as a highly effective unit, but committed atrocities against civilians and other human rights violations. Its successes in tracking and killing PLAN guerrillas prompted the SAP to consider setting up a similar division in South Africa.\n\nVlakplaas\n\nIn 1983, the SAP transferred De Kock to C10, a counter-insurgency unit headquartered at a farm called Vlakplaas, located  west of Pretoria. De Kock, who had established a reputation for commitment during his tours in Rhodesia and Namibia, was promoted as the unit's commanding officer two years later. Under his leadership, C10\u2014later known as C1\u2014became a death squad which hunted down and killed opponents of the National Party and the apartheid system.\n\nTRC testimony\nDe Kock first became prominent during his testimony in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 1998, during which he made multiple revelations relating to ANC deaths.\n\nDe Kock has been interviewed a number of times by psychologist Pumla Gobodo-Madikizela, who ended up releasing a book, A Human Being Died That Night, about her interviews with De Kock, her time on the TRC, and what causes a moral person to become a killer.\n\nTrial, conviction, and sentencing\nUpon being convicted on 30 October 1996, De Kock was sentenced to two life sentences plus 212 years in prison for crimes against humanity. The eighty-nine charges included six counts of murder, as well as conspiracy to murder, attempted murder, assault, kidnapping, illegal possession of a firearm, and fraud. De Kock served his sentence in the C Max section of the Pretoria Central Prison.\n\nImprisonment\nIn a local radio interview in July 2007, De Kock claimed that former president FW de Klerk's hands were \"soaked in blood\" and that de Klerk had ordered political killings and other crimes during the anti-apartheid conflict. These claims were in response to de Klerk's then-recent statements that he had a \"clear conscience\" regarding his time in office.\n\nThe Sunday Independent reported in January 2010 that De Kock was seeking a presidential pardon from President Jacob Zuma in exchange for more information about the apartheid government's death squads, and that a three-hour meeting between Zuma and the incarcerated De Kock took place in April 2009. A spokesman for Zuma denied the veracity of the report.\n\nIn 2012, De Kock made several pleas for forgiveness to the relatives of his victims. In January, he wrote a letter to the family of Bheki Mlangeni, apologising for killing the ANC attorney in a 1991 bomb attack; Mlangeni's mother, Catherine, doubted De Kock's sincerity as he had never before shown remorse. In February, De Kock met Marcia Khoza in his prison, confessing that he had personally executed her mother, Portia Shabangu, in an ambush in 1989; Khoza would not forgive him, because he had scarcely shown remorse during his TRC hearing.\n\nIn September 2014, De Kock met the Mamas, the family of another of his victims. Candice Mama, daughter of the late Glenack Masilo Mama, did forgive De Kock, even going as far as to express in countless interviews support for his bid for parole.\n\nParole\nJustice Minister Michael Masutha announced on 30 January 2015, that De Kock had been granted parole. At the press conference, it was announced that the date of his release would not be made public. Masutha further said that De Kock had expressed remorse for his crimes and had co-operated with authorities to recover the remains of a number of his victims. De Kock was nevertheless to remain on parole for the rest of his life.\n\nSee also\nDirk Coetzee\nCraig Williamson\nCivil Cooperation Bureau\nWouter Basson\nLothar Neethling\nJanusz Walu\u015b\nSiphiwe Mvuyane\n\nReferences\n\n1949 births\nSouth African prisoners and detainees\nLiving people\nAfrikaner people\nPolice officers convicted of crimes against humanity\nSouth African people of Dutch descent\nSouth African people convicted of crimes against humanity\nPrisoners and detainees of South Africa\nSouth African police officers convicted of crimes\nPeople who testified at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)\nTorturers", "machine_text": "Eugene Alexander de Kock is a former colonel in the South African Police Service (SAPS) and a convicted murderer.

De Kock was in charge of the apartheid government's death squads from the 1980s until the early 1990s. During his time in command, he oversaw the assassination of many anti-apartheid activists, including members of the African National Congress (ANC) and the South African Communist Party (SACP). He also played a role in a number of bombings and acts of sabotage. In 1994, following the end of apartheid and the establishment of a new, democratic government in South Africa, de Kock was arrested and charged with numerous crimes, including 122 counts of murder, fraud, and kidnapping. He was convicted of these charges and sentenced to two life terms plus 212 years in prison. De Kock's trial was significant in South Africa's transition to democracy as it was the first time that a senior member of the apartheid government's security establishment had been brought to trial for crimes committed during the apartheid era. His testimony also provided insight into the workings of the apartheid government's security apparatus. In 2015, de Kock was granted parole after serving 20 years in prison. He has since expressed remorse for his actions and has sought forgiveness from his victims' families. He has also become involved in community work and has provided assistance to victims of apartheid-era violence. De Kock's legacy remains controversial in South Africa, with some viewing him as a cold-blooded killer and others as a victim of the brutal apartheid system. His case continues to be studied by academics, journalists, and human rights activists in an effort to understand the human impact of apartheid-era violence.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 8324621}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Rhus garwellii\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Rhus garwellii  is an extinct species of flowering plant in the sumac family Anacardiaceae.  The species is known from fossil leaves found in the early Eocene deposits of northern Washington State, United States.  The species was first described from fossil leaves found in the Klondike Mountain Formation.  R. garwellii likely hybridized with the other Klondike Mountain formation sumac species R. boothillensis, R. malloryi, and R. republicensis.\n\nDistribution and paleoenvironment\nRhus garwellii is known from specimens which are recovered from an outcrop of the early Eocene, Ypresian Klondike Mountain Formation in Republic.  The Klondike Mountain Formation preserves an upland temperate flora which was first interpreted as being microthermal, however further study has shown the flora to be more mesothermal in nature.  The plant community preserved in the Klondike Mountain formation is a mixed conifer\u2013broadleaf forest with large pollen elements of birch and golden larch, but also having notable traces of fir, spruce, cypress, and palm.  Fossils of Rhus garwellii were described along with descriptions of the coeval species R. boothillensis and R. republicensis plus a redescription of R. malloryi.\n\nTaxonomy\nThe species was described from a type specimen, the holotype leaf, number SR 00-04-24, plus two paratype specimens SR 93-14-02 and SR 07-39-05 A & B.  The type series specimens are currently preserved in the paleobotanical collections of the Stonerose Interpretive Center in Republic, Washington.  The specimens were studied by paleobotanists Soon Flynn and Kathleen Pigg of Arizona State University with Melanie DeVore of Georgia College and State University. They published their 2019 type description for R. boothillensis in the International Journal of Plant Sciences.  The etymology of the chosen specific name garwellii is a patronym honoring Gar Rothwell recognizing his excitement and dedication for paleobotany.  In addition to Rhus garwellii Flynn et al also provided descriptions of the coeval species R. boothillensis and R. republicensis and a gave a redescription of R. malloryi in the 2019 paper.  They noted that the Klondike Mountain Formation preserves a number of Rhus specimens which appear to be hybrids of the named species.\n\nDescription\nFull R. garwellii pinnately compound leaves are unknown, with the leaflets being found without a petiole or rachis having been found at the time of description.  Unlike R. malloryi and R. republicensis which both have sessile leaflets, R. garwell and R. boothillensis leaflets have petiolules.  The  R. garwell leaflets are elliptical in outline, tapering from the wide middle to the symmetrical base and pointed apex.  They have a width of  and a length to width ratio of up to 2.6:1. The teeth along the margin have distinctly pointed tips with convex basal and apical sides running towards angular sinuses.\n\nThe midveins of the leaflets are thicker at the base and narrow from base to the leaflet apex, with smaller secondary veins branching off the midvein at acute angles.  The secondaries are branch from the midvein subopposite to alternately, with frequent intersecondary veins between them that branch into tetiaries.  The secondaries curved towards the leaflet edges, with a major fork between 40%\u201360% from the midvein.  The secondary veins major branch terminate in a tooth, while the minor branch terminates in the sinus above or below a tooth.  The tertiary veins are sinuous and connect to either the secondary veins or to the midvein.\n\nReferences\n\n\u2020garwellii\nPrehistoric angiosperms\nPlants described in 2019\nYpresian plants of North America\nExtinct flora of North America\nFossil taxa described in 2019\nKlondike Mountain Formation", "machine_text": "Rhus garwellii, commonly known as Garwell's sumac, is a species of deciduous shrub in the family Anacardiaceae. It is native to the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian Mountains. The plant is named after American botanist Alice Garwell, who specialized in the study of diatoms and freshwater algae. Garwell's sumac grows up to 3 meters in height and has a spreading, open habit. The leaves are pinnately compound, with 11 to 27 leaflets that are dark green and glossy on the upper surface and paler and hairy underneath. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring and early summer, followed by clusters of red, hairy fruits in autumn. The berries are sour and astringent, but have been used by Native Americans to make a lemon-flavored drink or powdered and used as a spice. The plant contains urushiol, which is the same compound found in poison ivy and can cause an allergic reaction in some people. Garwell's sumac is not commonly cultivated, but it is sometimes grown as an ornamental shrub in gardens for its attractive foliage and striking fall color. It is also sometimes used for erosion control or to reclaim disturbed lands. The plant is adapted to a variety of soil types and moisture conditions and can grow in full sun or partial shade. It is a pioneer plant that thrives in disturbed areas, including forest clearings, roadsides, and abandoned fields. Garwell's sumac is not considered threatened or endangered, although its range is limited to the eastern United States. It is a valuable plant for wildlife, providing food and cover for birds and small mammals. The plant is also important for pollinators, such as bees and butterflies, which visit its flowers for nectar and pollen.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 61254739}

This period is significant as it was during this time that Russia underwent tremendous social, political, and economic transformations. These changes had a consequent effect on Russia\u2019s military, leading to the transformation of the military ranks and insignia system of the country. The military ranks and insignia system of the Russian Federation\u2019s armed forces were reformed in the year 1994, following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The new system retained the general structure of the Soviet era system but with some modifications. The former 'Marshal of the Soviet Union' rank was replaced by the rank of 'General of the Army,' which is the highest attainable rank under the current system. The current military ranks of Russia's armed forces 1994\u20132010 hierarchy comprises of 8 categories, namely General officer, Field officer, Company or junior officer, Warrant officer, Senior sergeant, Sergeant, Junior sergeant, and Private or equivalent. Insignia designs and colors changed accordingly. Likewise, the number of stars added to the insignia indicates the rank of the officer or soldier. In conclusion, the changes in Russia\u2019s military ranks and insignia system from the year 1994 to 2010 were significant transformations.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Paul of Taranto\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Paul of Taranto was a 13th-century Franciscan alchemist and author from southern Italy. (Taranto is a city in Apulia.) Perhaps the best known of his works is his Theorica et practica, which defends alchemical principles by describing the theoretical and practical reasoning behind it.  It has also been argued that Paul is the author of the much more widely known alchemical text Summa perfectionis, generally attributed to the spurious Jabir, or Pseudo-Geber.\n\nDefinitions and Concepts \n\nWhen examining Paul\u2019s work, it is important to make the distinction from modern definitions of words to the definitions used by medieval philosophers and scientists.\n\nSubstance \u2013 Paul does not use \u201csubstance\u201d as the modern definition of \u201cmaterial\u201d or \u201cmatter.\u201d  Instead, substance describes something that is primary and can exist on its own.\n\nAccident \u2013 Paul doesn\u2019t use this term as an unexpected/unplanned event.  Instead, it is simply an attribute, or adjective, and cannot exist on its own.\n\nForm/Substantial Form \u2013 Form is something that acts on matter that gives it characteristics (e.g. color, hardness, and heaviness).  Substantial form is a fundamental type of \u201cform.\u201d\n\nAs an example to demonstrate:  Substance is simply the object itself, including characteristics that define the object, whereas accidents simply qualify it, but are not necessary for its existence.  For example, a bird could be considered the substance, generally combining characteristics such as feathers, a beak, and the ability to lay eggs.  Describing a bird as big/small or timid/aggressive simply adds qualification to the bird, but is not defining characteristics of a bird.  These concepts of substance and accident stem from Aristotle\u2019s works.\n\nTheorica et practica \n\nNature and intellect relationship\n\nPaul argues that human intellect is superior to nature.  Therefore, humans must have the ability to manipulate nature as they see fit.  Sculptures and painters, for example, use nature (marble for statue, paint etc) to create various forms of art.  They take natural materials and manipulate them in such a way (chiseling a statue, combining colors/drawing shapes, patterns, and figures) to create artistic works.  They are able to in a controllable manner alter and improve nature.  This thought is also reflected in the act of writing.  \u201c[T]he hand does not write by the motion alone of nature, but as ruled by intellect through art.\u201d  Artists are able to control nature and use it as a tool or instrument.  This concept of intellect over nature is derived from the pseudo-Aristotelian Liber de Causis.\n\nTwo categories of arts\n\nPaul then identifies two categories of arts: \u201cPurely artificial\u201d art alters the extrinsic form or \u201cform of art\u201d and \u201cperfective art\u201d alters the \u201cintrinsic\u201d form (or form of nature).  Purely artificial art only changes nature superficially, whereas perfective art changes the essence of nature.  Paul clarifies this distinction through the use of primary and secondary qualities.  The primary qualities are the four Aristotelian qualities, hot, cold, wet, and dry, which reside in the four elements (earth, water, air, and fire).  Secondary qualities include white, black, sweet, bitter, hard, soft, sharp, and dull.  Perfective art alters the primary qualities, while purely artificial art only results in changes among the secondary qualities; essential changes result from changes in primary qualities, while accidental changes are a result of changes in secondary qualities.  A painter and sculpture, then, only practice artificial art since they change shapes and colors of material.  Physicians are considered to practice perfective art since they attempt to control the four humors, which by their definition are characterized by the primary qualities.  Farmers too, practice perfective art since they work with the transmutation power inherent in seeds.\n\nAn analogous modern example of extrinsic versus intrinsic changes is the difference between a physical and chemical reaction.  In a physical reaction, there is no change in the molecules in the system.  Boiling water is a classic example: The system starts with liquid water, and when enough heat has been added to the water, the water boils into the gaseous phase.  While there has been a phase change, the water molecule, H2O hasn\u2019t broken apart and is still present at the end of the reaction, so this is analogous to an extrinsic change.  Electrolysis of water is a chemical change \u2013 electricity is used to break water into hydrogen and oxygen gas.  Since the molecules present have been changed, this is a chemical change, similar to an intrinsic change.\n\nSulfur-mercury theory of metals\n\nOne of the goals of Theorica et practica is to affirm the validity of the sulfur-mercury theory of metals, which basically states that metals are composed of sulfur and mercury and the different proportions between the two form different types of metals.  Observations of the reactivity of metals suggest that metals were in fact composed of sulfur and mercury.  When metals were heated, they gave off a sulfurous odor.  When mercury came in contact with metals such as gold, silver, copper, tin, or lead, an amalgam resulted.  These observations lead to the conclusion that metals were composed of both mercury and sulfur.\nPaul addresses one of the many arguments against the sulfur-mercury theory: that intermediate substances cannot exist between the pure elements and the \u201cfinal product.\u201d  Therefore, metals cannot be broken down into sulfur and mercury.  In Theorica et practica, Paul first presents this argument before declining it in a contra and pro fashion.  He first states the argument against the sulfur-mercury theory.  Essentially the argument is as follows: In order to make \u201cA\u201d from \u201cB and C\u201d, \u201cB and C\u201d become corrupted as soon as they combine to make \u201cA,\u201d so \u201cB and C\u201d clearly cannot exist within \u201cA.\u201d \n\nPaul then rebuttals against this argument in two ways: theoretical examples and scientific experimentations.  One example is how a smaller number can exist in a larger number.  For example, the quantity \u201c3\u201d resides in the quantity \u201c4\u201d; 4 can be viewed as the combination of 3 and 1.  A less abstract example is a live tree and a dead one.  The difference between them is simply the essence of life or its vegetative soul.  The dead tree still contains the substantial form of the wood, so clearly that form must have been there even when the tree was alive.  Paul\u2019s experimental approach is to decompose metals into other materials, then attempt to recombine those materials into the metal again.  If the sulfur-mercury theory is correct, you can decompose metals into the four elements, but when attempting to recombine the elements, there is no reason for the elements to recombine into any one particular metal.  Paul writes that he successfully recreated the same metal after a process of calcining, dissolving, subliming, and lastly reducing metals.  Since he was able to recreate the same metal that he started with, he obviously did not break the metal down into the pure elements, but instead into some intermediate phases.\n\nNotes\n\nItalian alchemists\nItalian Franciscans\n13th-century alchemists\n13th-century Italian writers\n13th-century Latin writers", "machine_text": "Paul of Taranto was an Italian painter born in the 14th century. He is known for his contributions to the development of the Byzantine style of painting which was popular in Italy during the Middle Ages. His works, which include frescoes and panel paintings, are characterized by intricate designs, vibrant colors, and religious themes. Paul was born in Taranto, a port city in southern Italy. He began his career as an artist in Rome, working under the patronage of Pope Clement VI. It is said that he was inspired by the works of the great Byzantine artists such as Duccio di Buoninsegna and Giotto di Bondone, whose works had a profound impact on the development of Western art. Paul's most famous work is the fresco cycle in the Church of San Domenico in Siena, which he completed in 1350. The cycle depicts scenes from the life of Saint Catherine of Siena, one of the patron saints of Italy. The frescoes are a masterpiece of the Byzantine style, with the use of gold leaf and intricate designs. In addition to his work in Siena, Paul also created panel paintings for various churches in Italy. His style is characterized by the use of rich colors and intricate designs, often featuring ornate borders and decorative patterns. Despite his contributions to the development of the Byzantine style in Italy, Paul remains relatively unknown outside of art circles. Nevertheless, his works continue to be admired for their beauty and the skillful mastery of the Byzantine painting technique. Today, Paul's works are held in collections around the world, including the National Gallery in London and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 24888846}

It is encoded by the MRPL24 gene that is located on the long arm of chromosome 3 in humans. This gene is known to express a protein that is made up of 122 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 13.4 kDa. The MRPL24 protein is involved in the assembly and functioning of the mitochondrial ribosome, which is responsible for synthesizing proteins that are used in the respiratory chain of mitochondria. It is a part of the 54S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome, which works together with the 28S subunit to form the complete ribosome. Several studies have shown that MRPL24 plays a crucial role in the survival and function of cells. Knocking down the MRPL24 gene in mammalian cells has been shown to result in decreased cell proliferation and viability, highlighting the importance of this protein in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Mutations in the MRPL24 gene have also been linked to several diseases, including Leigh syndrome and non-syndromic hearing loss. Leigh syndrome is a rare neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects the central nervous system, while non-syndromic hearing loss is a common genetic disorder that leads to hearing impairment. In summary, MRPL24 is a vital component of the mitochondrial ribosome and plays a pivotal role in the survival and function of cells.

CHKT's studios at 151 Esna Park Drive, Unit 26 in Markham. \n\nCHKT is powered at 50,000 watts, the maximum for Canadian AM stations.  It uses a directional antenna with a six-tower array, to protect other stations on AM 1430.  The transmitter is on one of the Toronto Islands.\n\nHistory\n\nCKCL and CKEY\nThe station that was the indirect forerunner of CHKT first signed on the air on May 5, 1925.  Its call sign was CKCL, broadcasting at 840 kilocycles, and owned by the Dominion Battery Company. As with many radio stations in the early years of radio broadcasting, the station changed frequencies a number of times in its first years of operation. It settled on 580 kHz frequency in 1931.\n\nIn 1945, the station was sold to Jack Kent Cooke's Toronto Broadcasting Co., and adopted the call sign CKEY. It was acquired in 1961 by Shoreacres Broadcasting, a consortium that included Westinghouse and The Globe and Mail. \nCKEY changed its frequency to 590 in 1964 as CKWW signed on at 580 that year in Windsor and CKAR, (known today as CFBK-FM), in Huntsville had to change its frequency from 590 to 630\u00a0kHz.\n\nTop 40\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, CKEY was the leading Top 40 competitor to 1050 CHUM.  One of its DJs was later CFNY staple David Marsden, known as Dave Mickie at CKEY (and later at CHUM as well). Another notable broadcaster was Bryan Fustukian, broadcasting as Vik Armen. The station dropped its Top 40 format for middle of the road music in 1965, now going up against CFRB, and was successful in that arena for a time. Shoreacres, in turn, was acquired by Maclean-Hunter in 1966.\n\nA transmitter for CKEY was once located on Midland Avenue and Eglinton Avenue East in Scarborough. This site was sold to the Scarborough Board of Education in 1964 to build Tabor Park Vocational School for the area's redevelopment.  From 1972 until the 1990s, CKEY's and then CKYC's offices and studios were located in the Toronto Star building at One Yonge Street.\n\nMOR and Oldies\nFrom 1970 to 1984, CKEY featured Charles Templeton and Pierre Berton on the commentary show Dialogue with Templeton also reading the morning news for several years. The station also had Stephen Lewis as a commentator in the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nOn January 1, 1984, CKEY flipped from its long running MOR format to soft rock/oldies as \"Solid Gold CKEY.\"\n\nOn April 25, 1988, Key Radio Limited was denied a license to move CKEY from 590\u00a0kHz to 99.1\u00a0MHz as well The CKO Radio Partnership (CKO) was also denied to move the all-news radio station CKO from 99.1\u00a0MHz to 590\u00a0kHz.\n\nOn June 20, 1988, the station became Key 590 moving from its Soft AC and Oldies mix to all Oldies, once again competing directly with a re-formatted CHUM. \n\nAt 7 p.m. on March 14, 1991, CKEY signed off and began stunting with the sound of a heartbeat. The following morning at 9, the station adopted a country format, changing its call sign to CKYC. The CKEY call sign was subsequently picked up by a station in Fort Erie.\n\nFrequency Swap\nAfter Rogers Communications acquired Maclean-Hunter in 1994, CKYC was sold to Telemedia. Telemedia subsequently swapped CKYC's frequency with that of its sports outlet CJCL. On February 6, 1995, at 10 AM, CKYC ceased airing country music, and after stunting with a ticking clock for two hours, CJCL and CKYC swapped frequencies. \n\nCKYC subsequently aired only syndicated programming until it went off the air permanently in late 1996.\n\nCHKT Signs On\nCHKT was launched as an ethnic, multilingual radio station by Fairchild Group in 1997, over the 1430 AM frequency that had been occupied by CKYC immediately prior to its signing off for the last time.  The CKYC call sign was subsequently picked up by a station in Owen Sound in 2001.\n\nIn October 2019, Fairchild Radio gained public attention when it fired a Toronto radio talk-show host allegedly because of his questions during an interview perceived as critical of the Chinese government's stance on the 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Fairchild Radio\n Remembering CKEY Radio Toronto - 580 - 590\n CHKT history - Canadian Communications Foundation\n \n\nHKT\nCHKT\nCHKT\nHKT\n1925 establishments in Ontario", "machine_text": "CHKTS is a Canadian radio station that broadcasts via AM 1430 and is licensed in Toronto, Ontario.

The 231st Reserve Infantry Regiment was raised in Thuringia, mainly in the duchy of Saxe-Altenburg and the Prussian Province of Saxony.  The 232nd Reserve Infantry Regiment was raised in Prussian Saxony and the Duchy of Anhalt.

The 50th Reserve Division suffered heavy losses during the war, with over 50,000 soldiers killed or wounded. The division was disbanded in 1919 as part of the demobilization of the German Army following the armistice. Despite its losses, the 50th Reserve Division was regarded as a highly effective fighting force, with its units receiving numerous commendations and citations for their valor in battle. The division was seen as an example of the high level of discipline and training within the German Army during World War I, and its legacy continued to influence military thinking in Germany for many years after the war.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 12963378}

Hugh left the company in 1899 and later return to Toronto to establish his own publication firm. John subsequently expanded his company into other areas of publishing, launching the general interest magazine Maclean's in 1905, the business newspaper Financial Post in 1907, the lifestyle magazine Canadian Homes and Gardens in 1925, the women's magazine Chatelaine in 1928, and its French-language counterpart, Ch\u00e2telaine in 1960.\n\nHorace Talmadge Hunter joined Maclean Publishing in 1903, moving up the management ranks from general manager in 1911 to succeed John Bayne Maclean as president in 1933; in 1945 the company's name was changed to Maclean-Hunter. Hunter retired in 1952 and died in 1961. Hunter's son Donald Fleming later became president and chairman of M-H.\n\nIn 1961, the company began to diversify, adding its first broadcasting asset, radio station CFCO in Chatham, Ontario. In 1968 Maclean-Hunter Publishing Company Limited was renamed to Maclean-Hunter Limited and finally as Maclean Hunter Limited in 1981.\n\nIn the 1970s, M-H merged its Le Maclean French-language magazine with Actualit\u00e9, and began publishing L'actualit\u00e9. In 1982, the company acquired a controlling interest in Sun Media; ownership of the Financial Post was transferred to Sun Media in 1987 to facilitate the publication's expansion from a weekly to a daily newspaper.\n\nBy the early 1990s, Maclean-Hunter's assets also included cable television services in 35 Ontario markets, 21 radio stations, television station CFCN in Calgary and a significant minority share in CTV.\n\nMaclean-Hunter was acquired in 1994 by Rogers Communications. The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission approved the transaction, but required Rogers to divest itself of some of Maclean-Hunter's individual assets to alleviate concerns about concentration of media ownership. Shaw Communications acquired some of the cable holdings and radio stations, Telemedia and Blackburn Radio acquired other radio stations, and the consortium of Baton Broadcasting and Electrohome acquired CFCN and the CTV shares. Sun Media was sold in an employee buyout in 1996.\n\nMaclean-Hunter also had cable holdings in the United States, which were acquired by Comcast in 1994.\n\nMaclean-Hunter lives on in the publication Maclean's magazine.\n\nIn 2016 L'Actualit\u00e9. was sold to Mishmash (XPND Capital).\n\nThe former assets of Maclean-Hunter were sold by Rogers to St. Joseph Communications in March 2019.\n\nOperations\nMaclean-Hunter's main office was at College Park from the 1980s until its acquisition by Rogers in 1994. Its previous head office was in a series of buildings along the corner of Dundas Street and University Avenue. Maclean's magazine moved to Rogers Communications premises at 1 Mount Pleasant Road (Rogers Building) and remained there until it was sold to St. Joseph Communications.\n\nIn 1948, M-H moved their printing plant at 210 Dundas Street West to North York (Highway 401-Yonge Street). The large plant was built near the home of Robert Earl Bales, Reeve of North York. The plant was sold and demolished in 2001 for re-development as \"Mansions of Avondale\" condominiums and Avondale Park.

They owned radio and television stations across the country, including CFTO-TV in Toronto, CKLW-TV in Windsor, and CHCH-TV in Hamilton. In the 1970s, they were one of the pioneers in the development of cable television in Canada and established the country's first cable television network. In addition to its media holdings, Maclean-Hunter was also involved in the forest products industry. They owned a number of sawmills and pulp and paper mills in Ontario and Quebec. In 1988, Maclean-Hunter was acquired by Rogers Communications, which caused the breakup of the company and the sale of its various assets. The Financial Post was sold to Thomson Newspapers, while other properties, including the television stations and cable networks, were sold to various other companies.

The film won awards at the 15th Antalya Film Festival (Umur Bugay \"Best Screenplay\") and \u015eener \u015een (\"Best Supporting Actor\").\n\nPlot \nApti, a slow-witted but likeable street cleaner lives and works in a neighborhood of \u0130stanbul. His superior \u015eakir, a corrupt, and abrasive Zab\u0131ta (Municipal Inspector) officer, purposely makes Apti's life miserable by berating him for most minor offences and making him to go errands for \u015eakir's annoying mother. Apti is in love with Hacer, a feisty house cleaner but his attempts to court her usually fails due to Hacer's overprotective brothers. \n\nIt is also revealed that \u015eakir and Hacer have feelings for each other but \u015eakir's overbearing mother refuses to allow her son to marry a \"lowly cleaner\". \u015eakir nevertheless wants to marry Hacer and after \u015eakir confronts her, Hacer's brothers beat him up.\n\nHad enough of \u015eakir's indecision, Hacer's father decides to marry her to Apti. Apti visits Hacer's house and despite the very low impression he left on them, Hacer's father allows them to marry. After \u015eakir hears the news, he attacks Apti then forces him to catch all the cats in the neighborhood for revenge. He also has Hacer's brothers arrested. \n\nAngered, Hacer attacks \u015eakir but the two make up during the fight after \u015eakir assures her that he will convince his mother. \u015eakir once again tries to talk his mother into allowing him to marry Hacer but she once again, rudely refuses. \u015eakir finally snaps and comically attempts to kill her by pushing her off the window. She survives after she falls on Apti.\n\nNext evening, Apti visits Hacer's house to finalize the marriage but unbeknowst to him \u015eakir and his mother, who is in bandages, are also in the house and they ask for Hacer's hand in marriage. Believing that a Municipal official has a more promising future than a street cleaner, Hacer's father breaks off her engagement with Apti. Angry and disappointed, Apti causes a scene but kicked out of the house. In a famous scene, Apti starts walking back home, throws flowers on the ground and eats the lokum by himself. (\"Fuck your Flowers!\")\n\nNext day, Apti's doorman friend \u0130smail convinces him to kidnap and have sex with Hacer so her father would have no choice but marry her to him. Apti then sneaks into Hacer's house and attempts to rape her. However he is quickly beaten back by Hacer's kid brother and escapes. Chased by Hacer's father and brothers, Apti accidentally enters a nightclub and finds himself on the stage. In panic, he starts singing some popular folk songs and audience starts cheering for him. Owner of the nightclub quickly hires him as the lead singer. \n\nFew days later posters with Apti's face fill the walls of the town. Realizing that she just rejected a rich husband for \u015eakir, Hacer falls ill. Hacer's father also tries to make things up with him but Apti, still angry over the earlier treatment he received, rudely rejects them and walks into the stage. His singing debut does not go well however, as his clumsiness gets the better of him and he causes accidents on the stage: he almost chokes a customer with mic's cord and accidentally removes the toupee of another. He is immediately fired and returns to his previous job of garbage man.\n\nSome time later, Hacer and \u015eakir are now married but it is soon revealed that the marriage is not a happy one after Hacer causes a scene in the morning. \u015eakir's life turns absolutely miserable, now stuck between his bickering mother and foul-tempered Hacer. Apti breathes a sigh of relief, realizing that he just dodged a bullet by not marrying an insufferable woman like Hacer. Film ends with Apti happily noticing another young cleaner lady on a nearby window, implying that he might find love again.\n\nCast \nKemal Sunal - Abdullah \"Apti\" \u015eakrak\n\u015eener \u015een - Zab\u0131ta Officer and boss of \u015eakir \nAy\u015fen Gruda - Hacer\n\u0130hsan Y\u00fcce - Hacer\u2018s father\nErdal \u00d6zya\u011fc\u0131lar - Hacer's older brother \nT\u00fcrker Tekin - Doorman \u0130smail\n\u0130lyas Salman - Doorman\nNejat G\u00fcr\u00e7en - Gazino Boss\n\u0130hsan Bilsev - The Patron Man\nMuadelet Tibet - Hanife\nSalih Sarikaya - Coffee Shop \nNezahat Tanyeri - Mother of Shakir\nNermin \u00d6zses - Mother of Hacer\nErtu\u011frul Bilda\n\nGallery\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \n\n1977 films\nTurkish films\n1970s comedy-drama films\nFilms shot in Istanbul\nTurkish comedy-drama films\n1978 comedy films\n1978 films\n1977 comedy films\n1977 drama films\n1978 drama films", "machine_text": "The King of the Street Cleaners is a title given to a man who has made significant contributions to the cleanliness of streets and public spaces in his community.

The battles took place in the North Atlantic Ocean between 1939 and 1943 and were essential in determining the outcome of the war. The North Atlantic was a crucial region during World War II, as it was the main shipping lane connecting America and Europe. The German navy had a powerful submarine force, or U-Boats, which posed a significant threat to Allied shipping. The British navy, on the other hand, had a sizeable fleet of destroyers and battleships tasked with protecting the convoys from German U-Boat attacks. The North Atlantic campaign began in September 1939, with the sinking of the British carrier HMS Courageous. The following year, in 1940, the German navy launched a massive submarine offensive against the British convoys, known as the Battle of the Atlantic. This battle saw intense fighting between the German and British navies, with both sides suffering losses. The Royal Navy responded by investing in the development of new technologies such as radar, depth charges, and sonar, which aided in detecting and destroying German U-Boats. Throughout the campaign, the British navy engaged in several significant battles. In November 1940, the Battle of Cape Spartivento saw a naval engagement between the British and Italian navies, resulting in the sinking of two Italian cruisers. In March 1941, the British navy engaged with the German battleships, Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, in the Battle of the Denmark Strait. The British lost their flagship, HMS Hood, in the battle, and the Germans were able to break through the English Channel. The North Atlantic campaign ended in 1943, with the Allies achieving a decisive victory. The Allied forces were able to overcome the German U-Boat threat, and the convoys could travel safely across the Atlantic without fear of attack. The successful outcome of the North Atlantic campaign was essential to the Allied victory in World War II, highlighting the crucial role played by naval forces in warfare.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 27875112}

It is a small, spreading shrub that typically grows to a height of 0.3 to 0.6 meters. The leaves are small, bi-pinnate, and have a distinct pale ghostly appearance due to the dense, white hairs on the upper and lower surfaces. The flowers of the ghost wattle are globular and bright yellow, and they appear from July to November. The ghost wattle is a hardy plant and is adapted to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is found in the Great Sandy Desert, Pilbara and Gascoyne regions, and other areas with similar climate and soils. The plant is often observed growing in shallow soils on rocky outcrops, on sand dunes, and in other areas with limited water availability. The ghost wattle is a radiation-absorbing species, and it has been used effectively to mitigate salinity in soils. Aboriginal people use the ghost wattle for medicinal purposes. The plant is known to possess antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. The leaves can be used to treat skin infections and are also effective in treating respiratory diseases. The ghost wattle was first described by the Australian botanist Allan Cunningham in 1838. The plant belongs to the family Fabaceae, and its taxonomy is still being revised. As of today, the plant is not yet a conservation concern, as it is widely distributed and has a stable population. However, some populations may be threatened by habitat loss due to mining, pastoralism, and other land use practices. The ghost wattle is an interesting and unique plant in Australia's native flora. Its striking appearance, medicinal properties, and ecological significance make it an essential part of the country's natural heritage.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 37935230}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Take a Picture (Filter song)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "\"Take a Picture\" is a song by American rock band Filter, released in 1999 as the second single from their second studio album, Title of Record (1999). The song became a hit at the start of 2000 following its January 18 retail release, peaking at number 12 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and number three in Canada. It also became a top-ten hit in New Zealand, peaking at number eight on the RIANZ Singles Chart.\n\nBackground and lyrics\nFilter frontman and founding member Richard Patrick has said that the song is about him getting drunk on an airplane and taking off all of his clothes. Patrick expanded in greater detail in a 2008 retrospective interview:\n\"When I wrote the chorus to \"Take a Picture\" [...] it was just after my friend was like, \"Do you remember anything you did last night?\" And I was like, \"What are you talking about?\" She said, \"My God, you were throwing beer bottles out of a cab window at a cop car. Do you remember that?\" And I said, \"Good lord, could you take my picture, 'cuz I won't remember.\" And that line just kinda stuck. Weeks later, I had another drunken experience \u2013 being on a plane and being blacked out and not feeling good and taking my shirt off, half in and out of consciousness \u2013 and I'm in the back of a paddy wagon. I\u2019m thinking, \"Oh my God, what is my dad gonna think of this shit?\" Y\u2019know, \"Dad, what do you think about your son now?\" So, the song is this amazing thing for me to look back on now.\"\n\nPatrick's father was offended by this line, but Patrick explained to his father that each time he sings the line it has a different meaning because Patrick changes the tone in which he delivers the line each time it's sung. The song was intended as a tribute to the Was (Not Was) song \"Dad, I'm In Jail\", from their album What Up, Dog?.\n\nChart performance\n\"Take a Picture\" reached number 12 on the US Billboard Hot 100 on February 5, 2000 after reaching the top 40 on December 14, 1999. The song hit number one on Billboards Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart on February 5, 2000. It became a top-five hit on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart at number four and the Modern Rock Tracks chart at number three. It was also a top-ten hit on the Adult Top 40 at number seven and a top-twenty hit on the Mainstream Top 40 at number 15, giving the band their only hit on these two charts. Internationally, \"Take a Picture\" reached number three in Canada, number eight in New Zealand, number 25 in the United Kingdom and number 32 in Australia.\n\nMusic video\nA music video, directed by David Meyers, featured the band in a dreamlike sequence taking place in five different main scenes: a crashed and burning jet airplane in the middle of the ocean, underwater below it without scuba gear on, on a tiny search boat rowboat in the middle of the ocean, a room in a house being flooded by water, and on the roof of this flooding house. Several segments include supermodel Jaime King.\n\nFilter appeared two years in a row at popular Washington, D.C./Baltimore radio station 99.1 HFStival.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"1987 Maryland train collision\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The 1987 Maryland train collision occurred at 1:30 pm on January 4, 1987, on Amtrak's Northeast Corridor main line. The site of the crash was in the Chase community in eastern Baltimore County, Maryland, United States, at Gunpowder Interlocking, about  northeast of Baltimore. Amtrak train 94, the Colonial, (now part of the Northeast Regional) traveling north from Washington, D.C., to Boston, crashed into a set of Conrail locomotives running light (without freight cars), and which had fouled (entered) the mainline. Train 94's speed at the time of the collision was estimated at . Fourteen passengers on the Amtrak train were killed, as well as the Amtrak engineer and lounge car attendant.\n\nThe Conrail locomotive crew failed to stop at the signals before Gunpowder Interlocking, and it was determined that the accident would have been avoided had they done so. Additionally, they tested positive for marijuana. The engineer served four years in a Maryland prison for his role in the crash. In the aftermath, drug and alcohol procedures for train crews were overhauled by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), which is charged with rail safety. In 1991, prompted in large part by the Chase Maryland crash, the United States Congress took even broader action and authorized mandatory random drug-testing for all employees in \"safety-sensitive\" jobs in all industries regulated by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) including trucking, bus carriers and rail systems. Additionally, all trains operating on the high-speed Northeast Corridor are now equipped with automatic cab signalling with an automatic train stop feature. Several safety issues were identified with Amfleet cars as well.\n\nAt the time, the wreck was the deadliest in Amtrak's history. It was surpassed in 1993, by Big Bayou Canot rail accident in Alabama that killed 47 and injured another 103.\n\nMovements of the trains pre-collision\n\nAmtrak Train 94 \nAmtrak Train 94 (the Colonial) left Washington Union Station at 12:30 pm (Eastern time) for Boston South Station. The train had 12 cars and was filled with travelers returning from the holiday season to their homes and schools for the second semester of the year. Two AEM-7 locomotives, numbered 900 and 903, led the train; #903 was the lead locomotive. The engineer was 35-year-old Jerome Evans.\n\nAfter leaving Baltimore Penn Station, the train's next stop was Wilmington, Delaware. Just north of Baltimore, while still in Baltimore County, the four-track Northeast Corridor narrows to two tracks at Gunpowder Interlocking just before crossing over the Gunpowder River. The train accelerated north toward that location.\n\nConrail light engine move \nRicky Lynn Gates, a Penn Central and Conrail engineer since 1973, was operating a trio of Conrail GE B36-7 locomotives light (with no freight cars) from Conrail's Bayview Yard just east of Baltimore bound for Enola Yard near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Gates was later determined to have violated several signal and operating rules, including a failure to properly test his cab signals as required before departure from Bayview. It was later discovered that someone had disabled the cab signal alerter whistle on lead unit #5044 with duct tape, muting it almost completely. Also, one of the light bulbs in the PRR-style cab signal display had been removed. Investigators believed these conditions probably existed prior to departure from Bayview and that they would have been revealed by a properly performed departure test.\n\nGates and his brakeman, Edward \"Butch\" Cromwell, were also smoking marijuana cigarettes. Marijuana can alter one's sense of time and impair the ability to perform tasks that require concentration. Cromwell was responsible for calling out the signals if Gates missed them, but failed to do so.\n\nThe collision \n\nAs Amtrak Train 94 approached Gunpowder Interlocking near the Chase community on the electrified main line, the three Conrail freight locomotives were moving north on one of the adjacent freight tracks. Before the adjacent tracks reached the bridge at the river, they merged into the two through tracks that cross the bridge.\n\nWhile the tracks and interlocking plant at this location are signalized to alert locomotive engineer when the interlocking switches are set for through track train movement, the switches are not designed to de-rail a locomotive or train that runs through them when they are aligned for through track train movement.\n\nIn the case of the accident, the interlocking plant was properly set for through track movement only, so as to allow the Amtrak train to pass the freight locomotives (which should have been stopped on the side tracks) on the through tracks onto and over the bridge. The freight locomotive crew ignored the stop signals in their locomotive cab (which were muted), and at trackside, visible to them from the cab of their locomotive.\n\nSpeed/event recording devices indicated that the Conrail locomotives were moving at approximately  when their brakes were applied for an emergency stop, after they had passed the trackside signals. This was, Gates later claimed, when he realized that he did not have a wayside signal to proceed north at the interlocking. He was, however, moving too fast to stop before passing the signal indicating he should stop clear of the main track on which #94 was approaching. Had Gates reacted either to an approach signal instructing him to reduce speed, or to the stop signal itself in a timely fashion, or had the brakeman called out the state of the signals as he was supposed to do, it was likely the Conrail engines could have stopped short of the switch.\n\nThe Conrail locomotives came to a stop on the track directly in front of #94, which approached the interlocking at a speed between . Although the maximum allowed speed for Amtrak AEM-7 locomotives carrying cars on this corridor was 125\u00a0mph, #94 was carrying one Heritage style passenger car, whose maximum allowed speed was limited to . The conductor for #94 testified that he did inform the fatally injured train engineer of the Heritage car on the train; in any event, its presence meant that the Amtrak train was speeding. With little time to react, Amtrak engineer Evans apparently saw the diesels on the line in front of him and applied the brakes for an emergency stop. The NTSB determined that even if #94 had been travelling at , the Amtrak's authorized speed limit, the collision was unavoidable at this point.\n\nOn impact, the rearmost Conrail diesel, GE B36-7 #5045 exploded and burned down to the frame completely destroying the unit. The middle unit, #5052, sustained significant damage to the front while lead unit #5044 had little damage.\n\nOne of Amtrak's AEM-7s, #900, was buried under the wreckage, while the lead locomotive, #903, ended up among some trees on the west side of the right of way. Several Budd Company Amfleet cars were piled up, with some crushed under the pile.\n\nCromwell, who was on the lead locomotive with Gates, suffered a broken leg in the collision. Gates was uninjured. The Amtrak engineer, lounge car Lead Service Attendant and 14 passengers were killed.\n\nThe front cars on the Amtrak #94 train suffered the greatest extent of damage and were almost completely crushed. However, they were nearly empty - awaiting additional holiday passengers en route who would have boarded the train at stations further north. According to the NTSB, had these cars been fully occupied at the time, the death toll would have been at least 100. There were relatively few passengers on those cars, however, and so the death toll was much less. Most of the dead were on Amtrak car #21236.\n\nPost-collision response and cleanup \nWith a total passenger load of about 600 people, there was a great deal of confusion after the collision. Witnesses and neighbors ran to the smoking train and helped remove injured and dazed passengers, even before the first emergency vehicles could arrive at the location.\n\nWhile many of the injured passengers were aided by nearby residents, some of the uninjured passengers wandered away, making it difficult for Amtrak to know the complete story.\n\nEmergency personnel worked for many hours in the frigid cold to extricate trapped passengers from the wreckage, impeded by the stainless-steel Amfleet cars' skin resistance to ordinary hydraulic rescue tools. Helicopters and ambulances transported injured people to hospitals and trauma centers. It was over 10 hours after the collision before the final trapped people were freed from the wreckage.\n\nIt was several days before the wrecked equipment was removed and the track and electrical propulsion system were returned to service.\n\nConrail diesel, GE B36-7 #5045 was completely destroyed while #5044 and #5052 were repaired and returned to service. Both Amtrak's AEM-7s and a few Amfleet cars were also destroyed in the collision.\n\nInvestigation, charges and conviction \n\nGates and Cromwell initially denied smoking marijuana. However, they later tested positive for the substance. A National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation revealed that had Gates slowed down at the signals as required, he would have stopped in time. It also determined that Gates and Cromwell's marijuana use was the \"probable cause\" of the accident. Gates and Cromwell were immediately suspended by Conrail pending an internal investigation, but resigned rather than face certain termination.\n\nGates was eventually charged with manslaughter by locomotive; under Maryland law a locomotive is considered a motor vehicle. Prosecutors cut a deal with Cromwell in which he agreed to testify against Gates in return for immunity. Gates was sentenced to five years in state prison and one year's probation, and was later sentenced to an additional three years on federal charges of lying to the NTSB. Gates' history of DWI (driving while intoxicated) convictions as well as his admission that the crew had been using marijuana while on duty led for a call to certify locomotive engineers as to their qualifications and history.\n\nToxicology tests on the Amtrak engineer's body returned negative. In a 3-2 decision, the NTSB report stated that the speed of train #94 at the time the brakes were applied, between , was an unauthorized excessive speed, since the maximum for an Amtrak train carrying Heritage cars was . The excessive speed was determined to have been a contributing factor to the amount of damage to both trains at the point of impact. The two dissenters to the report believed that it was unreasonable to assign contributory blame to the Amtrak engineer based solely on the premise of the Heritage car lowering its speed limit.\n\nGates was released from prison in 1992 after serving four years (two years of a state sentence, then two more years of a federal sentence), and then worked as an abuse counselor at a treatment center. In a 1993 interview with The Baltimore Sun, Gates said the accident would have never happened if not for the marijuana, saying that it had thrown off his \"perception of speed and distance and time.\" He admitted that in his rush to get back to Baltimore and get high, he skipped critical safety checks; he believed that had he performed those checks, \"I wouldn't have been in front of that train.\" He also revealed he had smoked marijuana on the job several times.\n\nAdditionally, it was never determined if the alerter whistle was muted while the locomotives were at Bayview yard. The alerter whistle on these locomotives were notorious for being irritating and loud, which was pointed out in a 1979 accident of a Union Pacific train in Wyoming which involved muting the whistle with a rag. The whistle was easily accessible by removing a cover on the back of the control stand that was sealed with latches, so it was possible for the Conrail crew to have muted the whistle before they left or before the units arrived at Bayview yard (which would have been done by other crews), but Gates reported that the whistle was relatively faint when it was tested, which meant that it could not be heard over the sound of the trailing units. The whistle was so well muted, that when it was sent to the FBI, they were not able to determine when and who muted it, due to the lack of fingerprints.\n\nWhen Conrail unit 5044 was tested after the accident, it was found that all light bulbs (including a replacement for the missing one) were working, and it was undetermined if the light bulb was removed while Conrail and Amtrak left the units unattended. Gates recalled having tested the cab signalling and seeing all the aspects, but he might have not looked at all the lights. The deadmans pedal was also found to have been disabled, when Gates was trying to reactivate the cab signaling system by switching it off in the nose of the locomotive (this was despite the cab signalling and deadmans pedal levers being different in aspect). The data recorder found that the reverser was put into the reverse position two hours after the accident, and the locomotive's fuses, battery and engine switched off.\n\nChanges for future prevention \nAs a result of the wreck, all locomotives operating on the Northeast Corridor are now required to have automatic cab signaling with an automatic train stop feature. Although common on passenger trains up until that time, cab signals combined with train stop and speed control had never been installed on freight locomotives due to potential train handling issues at high speed. Conrail subsequently developed a device called a locomotive speed limiter (LSL), a computerized device that is designed to monitor and control the rate of deceleration for restrictive signals in conjunction with cab signals. All freight locomotives which operate on the Northeast Corridor must now be equipped with an operating LSL which also limits top speed to . Previously, freight locomotives were only required to have automatic cab signals without an automatic train stop feature.\n\nAlso as a direct result of this collision, federal legislation was enacted that required the FRA to develop a system of federal certification for locomotive engineers. These regulations went into effect in January 1990. Since then, railroads are required by law to certify that their engineers are properly trained and qualified, and that they have no drug or alcohol impairment motor vehicle convictions for the five-year period prior to certification. Another effect was that age-old Rule G (The use of intoxicants or narcotics by employees subject to duty, or their possession or use while in duty, is prohibited. \u2014 UCOR, 1962) was revamped to:\n\nEmployees are prohibited from engaging in the following activities while on duty or reporting for duty:\n\n1. Using alcoholic beverages or intoxicants, having them in their possession, or being under the influence.\n\n2. Using or being under the influence of any drug, medication, or other controlled substance - including prescribed medication - that will in any way adversely affect their alertness, coordination, reaction, response or safety.  Employees having questions about possible adverse effects of prescribed medication must consult a Company medical officer before reporting for duty.\n\n3. Illegally possessing or selling a drug, narcotic or other controlled substance.\n\nAn employee may be required to take a breath test and/or provide a urine sample if the Company reasonably suspects violation of this rule.  Refusal to comply with this requirement will be considered a violation of this rule and the employee will be promptly removed from service.  Source: NORAC operating rules 6th edition effective  January 1, 1997\n\nA form of Rule G has existed in many railroad operating manuals for decades. However, the federal codification of this rule was deemed necessary to assure that any violator would be dealt with in a consistent and harsh manner. Also, anyone who passes a stop signal loses his or her FRA certification for a period not less than 30 days for a first offense. This is per 49 CFR part 240.\n\nIn 1991\u2014prompted in large part by the Chase crash\u2014Congress authorized mandatory random drug-testing for all employees in \"safety-sensitive\" jobs in industries regulated by DOT.\n\nMemorials \n\nTen years after the collision, the McDonogh School of Owings Mills, Maryland decided to build a 448-seat theater in memory of one of the crash's victims and alumna, 16-year-old Ceres Millicent Horn, daughter of American mathematicians Roger and Susan Horn. Ceres Horn graduated from McDonogh at age 15 and enrolled and was accepted at Princeton University at age 16 where she majored in astrophysics.\n\nOn January 4, 2007, the 20th anniversary of the crash, her family visited the theatre for the first time and attended a ceremony at the McDonogh School held in honor of their daughter.\n\nThe Baltimore County Fire Department's medical commander at the scene 20 years earlier told the newspaper that the Amtrak crash is still being used as a case study in effective disaster response. \"The reason is how the members of the professional and volunteer fire departments and the community people got together.\" It was, he said, \"a very sad but a very proud moment\" in his career.\n\nSee also \n1996 Maryland train collision, involving two passenger trains\nHinton train collision, similar accident in Canada the previous year in which a freight disregarded signals and collided head-on with an intercity passenger train; the freight's crew was also found to have adversely impacted mental capacity (in their case due to insufficient rest and the engineer possibly having a heart attack or stroke) and had disabled safety features as well.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n Picture of AEM-7 Amtrak #903 in Wilmington, Baltimore after the crash - http://www.railpictures.net/photo/78276/\n Pictures of the 2 Amtrak AEM-7's on flat cars near the accident site - Lancaster Dispatcher - Lancaster Chapter NHRS (January 2010, Vol. 41 #1) - https://web.archive.org/web/20160910044434/http://nrhs1.org/images/Dispatcher_Jan_10.pdf\n \n\nRailway accidents and incidents in Maryland\nRailway accidents in 1987\n1987 in Maryland\nAccidents and incidents involving Amtrak\nAccidents and incidents involving Conrail\nChase, Maryland\nRailway accidents involving a signal passed at danger\nJanuary 1987 events in the United States\nTrain collisions in the United States\nRail accidents caused by a driver's error", "machine_text": "The 1987 Maryland train collision was a catastrophic disaster that occurred on January 4, 1987, in Washington County, Maryland, USA.

However, the signalman at Cherry Run did not notice that the Conrail freight train was stopped before the switch, and he signaled for the Chessie System freight train to proceed northbound on Track 2, which was also the Amtrak train's track. The Amtrak train collided with the Chessie System freight train, causing the death of three crew members and thirty-five passengers, and injuring over 200 others. The impact was so great that the locomotives of both the Amtrak train and the Chessie System freight train derailed and fell into nearby waterways. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) conducted an investigation of the accident and found that numerous factors contributed to the disaster, including inadequate training of the signalmen, defective signal lights, and poor communication between the train crews and the signalmen. The 1987 Maryland train collision remains one of the deadliest train accidents in the history of Maryland. Since the accident, significant improvements have been made to the safety protocols and equipment used by train crews and signalmen. The accident stands as a stark reminder of the importance of ensuring proper communication and safety measures in the railroad industry. Today, the tragedy is honored by a memorial plaque at the site of the disaster, which serves as a reminder to all who visit of the lives lost and the importance of safety in the railroad industry.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2790429}

It stars Sudhakar, Raadhika, Vijayan and Rati. The film was released on 31 August 1979.\n\nPlot \nSudhakar is a poor man desperately looking for work. One day he has a skirmish with Radhika, a rich woman and only daughter of a businessman Selladurai, in a telephone booth. Radhika finds out that Sudhakar is searching for a job from his diary that he leaves at the booth. She employs him in her father's firm as a manager and soon they mutually fall in love. Radhika's class-conscious father initially opposes but later reluctantly agrees to have them married. However things take a turn when his business friend Sivaraman, to whom he owes a lot of favours, visits him and reminds him of his old promise to get Radhika married to Sivaraman's son Vijayan. And soon after Sudhakar goes missing with five lakhs of the office cash on his way to Bombay and is presumed to have absconded. Radhika is heart-broken and her father takes her to Sivaraman's estate in Ooty to relax for a while.\n\nIn Ooty, Radhika and her father are introduced to Vijayan who shockingly seems to be a severely despondent alcoholic. He is often seen standing near the shore of the river listening to his tape recorder playing a lone melodious song, sung by a woman. After a few days in the estate and several interactions, Vijayan and  Radhika get acquainted and friendly with each other and he opens up about his erstwhile lover Rathi. Vijayan had fallen in love with the beautiful Rathi at first sight and pursues her relentlessly till she finally reciprocates. Rathi often playfully cheats Vijayan about not knowing stuff like horse riding and car driving when she actually could. And on an April Fool's Day when she claims she doesn't know how to swim, Vijayan thinks she's fooling him again and playfully pushes her into the river but to his horror she drowns and dies. The incident left Vijayan as a suicidal wreck who carries poison in his coat but doesn't consume it just for his father's sake. Rather he has chosen the slow poison of alcohol. When Vijayan learns Radhika too has a past forlorn love affair, he feels closer to her since they both seem to be in the same boat.\n\nAs days move on, Vijayan and Radhika get closer to each other and eventually agree to get married, much to the delight of their fathers but then on an eventful day Radhika encounters Sudhakar working as a gardener in the estate. Radhika angrily admonishes him for having deserted her and walks away but Vijayan is determined to find out the truth. It turns out that Sudhakar was coerced and forced to decamp by Radhika's father himself so he could get her married to Vijayan.  On the day of their supposed marriage, Vijayan gets Radhika united with Sudhakar and they leave town together. Later, Vijayan who had promised to Radhika to give up alcohol, instead consumes the poison he carried in his pocket and walks into the river that had once consumed his beloved Rathi. Before dying Vijayan makes a statement to God, \"They say love is blind, but You have been blind to my love, so I am leaving my glasses for You\".\n\nCast \nSudhakar as Sudhakar\nRaadhika as Radhika\nVijayan as Vijayan\nRati as Rathi\nVagai Chandrasekhar\n\nProduction \nAfter Panchu Arunachalam wrote the screenplay for the film that would become Niram Maratha Pookal, Bharathiraja approached K. Bhagyaraj for advice; Bhagyaraj rewrote the screenplay. When Panchu learned of this, after reading Bhagyaraj's rewritten version, he recommended that it be made into a film. Bharathiraja initially wanted Rajinikanth, Kamal Haasan and Sridevi to portray the characters Vijayan, Sudhakar and Rati; the producer who initially was supposed to produce died, so Sudhakar, Raadhika, Vijayan and Rati Agnihotri were instead cast as the lead characters, with their characters being named after themselves. Ravi, who later debuted with Bharathiraja's Nizhalgal (1980) was asked to audition as a dubbing artist for Vijayan. However, since Bharathiraaja himself decided to dub for the character, Ravi was dropped.\n\nSoundtrack \nThe music was composed by Ilaiyaraaja.\n\nRelease and reception \nNiram Maratha Pookal was released on 31 August 1979.

He was the co-founder with Morton Subotnick of the San Francisco Tape Music Center in 1962. He is the son of Spanish writer Ram\u00f3n J. Sender.\n\nEducation\nSender was born in Madrid, Spain, and left the country during the civil war following the Fascist coup there in 1936. He studied piano with George Copeland, harmony with Elliott Carter, and counterpoint and fugue with Harold Shapero (1948\u20131951). Sender attended the Conservatorio di Santa Cecilia in Rome and Columbia University in New York, where he studied with Henry Cowell.  He also studied with Robert Erickson at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music (1959\u20131962) and at Mills College, where he studied with Darius Milhaud. Sender holds a Bachelor of Music degree from the San Francisco Conservatory of Music and an M.A. from Mills College.\n\nSan Francisco Tape Music Center\nSender co-founded the San Francisco Tape Music Center in 1962 with Morton Subotnick and also collaborated with composers and visual artists including Pauline Oliveros, Tony Martin, Joseph Byrd, Terry Riley, William Maginnis, and many others until 1966 when the Center was incorporated into Mills College.  It was later named the Mills Center for Contemporary Music and continues to function today.\n\nSender participated with Don Buchla and Morton Subotnick in the design of the Buchla Box, one of the first music synthesizers.\n\nMorningstar and Wheeler Ranches\n\nIn January 1966, he co-produced the Trips Festival with Ken Kesey and Stewart Brand. It was a three-day event that, in conjunction with The Merry Pranksters, brought together the nascent hippie movement for the first time.\n\nIn April 1966, Sender became the first resident at Lou Gottlieb's Morning Star Ranch (Sender has, at times, referred to himself as Ramon Sender Morningstar) open land commune, which evolved into a Digger Farm / open land commune in 1967.  After the residents' homes were bulldozed by Sonoma County authorities three times, he moved into the Wheeler Ranch in Occidental, California. Currently both properties have reverted to private ownership. Sender continued living and working in the area until 1980 when he returned to San Francisco. As \"His Imperial Nothingness, Zero the Clown,\" he has continued appearing in the annual Occidental Fools Parade.\n\nOne of the residents at Wheeler at Ranch was Alicia Bay Laurel, a visual artist, author and singer-songwriter known for her 1970 best-seller Living on the Earth.  He collaborated with her on another book, Being of the Sun, which contains information about homemade music, drones, modes, and open tunings as a means of spiritual growth, as well as information about yoga, creating ritual, and forming intentional communities. In 1973, Sender made a reel-to-reel recording of himself and Laurel performing songs, chants and improvisations from the book, which Laurel released in 2013 as a CD on her record label, Indigo With Stars, titled Songs from Being of the Sun.\n\nDuring the late 1970s, Sender was one of the founding members of The Occidental Community Choir (the nearest town to the Wheeler Ranch commune), for whom he wrote original music and shared his skills as a choral arranger. The choir's rendition of Sender's arrangement of Laurel's song, \"In the Morning\" appears on her CD, Music from Living on the Earth.\n\nIn 2006, stage producer, arranger and bassist Nicholas Alva created a musical based on the story of the open land communes Morningstar and Wheeler Ranch, including songs by Sender. In 2020 the music and dialogue were recorded and released as an ebook.\n\nSender co-curated \"The Hippies,\" an exhibition re-telling in written narration, photography, art and memorabilia, the history of the west Sonoma County Open Land communes, at the West County Museum in Sebastopol, California (part of the Sonoma County Historical Society.) Running from October 30, 2016 to March 5, 2017, it was the most popular exhibition ever at the West County Museum.\n\nLater Years in San Francisco\n\nIn 1980, Sender returned to San Francisco where he married his long-time friend Judith Levy-Sender, who taught in the San Francisco School District for thirty years. A poet and self-taught artist, he helped her publish two books of poems and artwork, the last titled \"Transitions Visible and Invisible.\" Collaborating with her, they founded the Odd Mondays speaker series that they ran for eighteen years before turning it over to a new producer.\n\nSender is also a visual artist whose visual works are sampled on his web site and in a 2009 book, Barayon, a Catalog of Prints, Drawings, Original Art.  The book is based on a one-man show at the Gallery Sanchez in 2008.\n\nAfter the death of Sender's daughter Xaverie in 1989, he founded the Peregrine Foundation (for people \"living in or exiting from experimental social groups\"). He was the administrator of the foundation until 1999 and published four full-length autobiographies of women who had left the Bruderhof community in a series titled \"Women from Utopia.\"\n\nSender identifies himself as a \"transcendental, post-monotheist hippie pagan sun worshipper, with one foot planted in the nondual teaching of Julie Henderson and the other in the Archaic Revival culture\".\n\nIn 2018, Spanish documentary filmmaker Luis Olano released Sender Baray\u00f3n Un Viaje Hacia La Luz (A Trip into the Light), a film about the life and works of Ram\u00f3n Sender Baray\u00f3n, including interviews with Sender at his home in San Francisco, archival photos and footage, and recordings of Sender's music.

He has several other unpublished manuscripts and some of his short stories are published on the internet.\n\nIn 1989, Sender published A Death in Zamora, a book investigating the execution of his mother by Franco's forces during the Spanish Civil War. The book has been recognized not only as a valuable record of the Spanish Civil War, but as a historical account of early feminism and rebellion against patriarchy in Spain, of which his mother, Amparo Baray\u00f3n, was a pioneer. An updated edition (2018), based on the Spanish Post-Metropolis Editorial 2017 edition, contains essays by renowned Spanish Civil War historians Paul Preston, Helen Graham and Francisco Espinosa Maestre.

It does not have a ticket agent, but the station does have personnel that can assist riders upon departure and arrival. The station is directly across the tracks from the National New York Central Railroad Museum.\n\nHistory \nElkhart station was originally built in 1900 by the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway and had a freight house installed across the tracks in 1907. The building is constructed of red brick trimmed with limestone, which is used for the window surrounds and belt course. The station was originally set amid a well-kept garden that displayed neat beds of colorful flowers and a row of trees along the tracks; this manicured landscape was not only a pretty introduction to the city for first time visitors, but it also buffered the streets of downtown from the noise and dirt associated with steam engines and freight trains. The station and the railroad were acquired by the New York Central Railroad in 1914. NYC merged with the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1968, and passenger service was taken over by Amtrak in 1971. The freight house became the National NYC Museum in 1987.\n\nTransit connections \n\nMACOG Interurban Trolley's Elkhart-Goshen and Concord routes both stop near the station.

The station was designed by the prominent architect Solon Spencer Beman, who also designed several other stations along the same route, including the South Bend station. Throughout the twentieth century, Elkhart station served as a vital transportation hub for the region, connecting Elkhart to major cities across the Midwest and the East Coast. However, with the rise of commercial air travel and the decline of railroads in the latter part of the century, the station saw a decline in ridership and underwent several renovations and updates. Today, Elkhart station remains an important transportation center for the region, connecting travelers to major cities and tourist destinations across the United States.

Christie (born 1964) is a Professor of Medicine and Neuroscience at The University of Victoria. He helped found the Neuroscience Graduate Program at the University of Victoria and served as its director from 2010\u20132017. He is a Michael Smith Senior Scholar Award winner. Christie received his PhD in 1992 from the University of Otago before doing postdoctoral work with Daniel Johnston at Baylor College of Medicine and Terrence Sejnowski at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, and then became   Assistant Professor at the University of British Columbia. Promoted to Associate Professor in 2007. Full Professor in 2013.\n\nResearch\nChristie's early research focused on heterosynaptic plasticity in the hippocampal formation. During the course of this work, he discovered that prior synaptic activity could impact the capacity for synapses to subsequently show activity-dependent forms of plasticity, a phenomenon that he originally called \"priming\" but that has since been termed \"metaplasticity\". His Ph.D. work generated 9 publications on synaptic plasticity with Abraham. Following the completion of his Ph.D., he became interested in how calcium entered neurons, and began a post-doctoral fellowship with Dan Johnston. In this period he showed for the first time, using calcium imaging, that different types of voltage-gated calcium channels were not distributed homogeneously throughout neuron dendrites and somata. Moreover, he was able to show that certain types of voltage-gated channels played a preferential role in long-term forms of synaptic depression, or LTD. Despite lasting only 2.5 years, this post-doctoral fellowship generated 8 publications. In 1996, Christie turned down several job offers at Canadian institutions and moved to the Salk Institute to work with T. Sejnowski. While his aspirations for becoming more involved in the computational modeling the Sejnowski lab was known for were not realized, it was during this period that met Dr.'s Henriette van Praag and Fred \"Rusty\"Gage and became interested in neurogenesis. Together these individuals published four influential publications on adult hippocampal neurogenesis, with Christie performing the majority of the electrophysiological recordings.\n\nChristie's research has shown that exercise promotes adult neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus.\n\nThis work has since progressed to show that exercise can have beneficial effects for the brains of animals that have been exposed to ethanol while in the womb, an animal model of fetal alcohol syndrome effects. His current work continues to examine how exercise can benefit the brain. He is part of the Island Medical Program and the Division of Medical Sciences, a joint venture of the University of British Columbia and the University of Victoria to increase the number of medical doctors being trained in Canada, and teaches neuroanatomy and problem-based learning (PBL) in this program . His current research concentrates on how exercise generates new brain cells, enhances synaptic plasticity, and affects learning and memory processes in people with Alzheimer's Disease, stroke, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Disorder (FASD), Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). particularly in the hippocampus. This work is funded by a variety of organizations including NSERC, FRAXA, Azrieli, and CIHR. Christie also has an extensive research program focused on mild traumatic brain injury at the University of Victoria. He is the director of the concussion laboratory at UVic, which focuses on clinical research, but has also initiated an extensive pre-clinical research program around repeated mild traumatic brain injury and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) that is funded by CIHR. He has recently expanded the focus of his prenatal exposure research to include both prenatal cannabis and prenatal ethanol exposure, and is funded by CIHR to determine how prenatal exposure to these substances impacts learning and memory processes in the developing brain.

It begins near La Mesa Dam as the San Francisco del Monte River, which officially takes the name San Juan River when it meets with Mariblo Creek in Quezon City. As the San Juan River, it passes through Quezon City, San Juan, the Manila district of Santa Mesa and Santa Ana, and Mandaluyong.\n\nRight-of-way issues caused the realignment of the Santa Mesa portion of the Skyway Stage 3. Instead of passing through Old Santa Mesa Street, the expressway now follows the course of the San Juan River from Araneta Avenue to Pasig River.\n\nTributaries\nAside from the San Francisco del Monte River, the San Juan River has five creeks as its main tributaries (starting from its mouth going upstream):\n\n Buhangin Creek in Mandaluyong is the tributary nearest to the river's confluence with the Pasig. Its mouth is in Barangay Poblaci\u00f3n, Mandaluyong, near the end of Bonifacio Avenue where it meets New Panaderos Street. Its traceable headwaters are somewhere in Barangay Zu\u00f1iga.\n Maytunas Creek in San Juan has its mouth near Sevilla Bridge at the end of Shaw Boulevard, Barangay Daang Bakal. Its traceable headwaters are somewhere near the National Center for Mental Health in Mandaluyong.\n Salap\u00e1n Creek (also called Ermita\u00f1o Creek) in San Juan is the third main tributary of the San Juan River. Its mouth is located in Barangay Salap\u00e1n, San Juan near Aurora Boulevard, and crosses Wilson Street near Barasoain Street in Barangay Greenhills, San Juan. Its known sources are near Club Filipino and inside the Wack Wack Golf and Country Club, both in San Juan; and in Barangay Bagong Lipunan Crame, Quezon City.\nDilim\u00e1n Creek in Quezon City is the fourth main tributary. It joins the San Juan River in Barangay Kalusugan near E. Rodriguez Avenue behind St Luke's Medical Center. Its traceable headwaters are in Quezon City. The southernmost branch can be traced to Barangay Santolan near Blue Ridge Subdivision, the northernmost in Brgy. Pans\u00f3l near the UP Integrated School. An intermediate branch springs from within the Ateneo de Manila University campus, while a fourth branch, known as Victoria Creek, passes by the Anonas Avenue area and is notable for defining the boundary of Project 2 and 3, before finally ending in Barangay Duyan Duyan in Project 3.\n Mariblo Creek (sometimes called Talayan Creek and Tanque Creek; also spelt Mariablo) in Quezon City is the fifth main tributary. Mariblo Creek joins the San Franc\u00edsco River to form the San Juan River in Barangay Mariblo, near Quezon Avenue. Its traceable headwaters are in Barangay Bungad near the corner of West Avenue and EDSA; at the opposite end of West Avenue, near the Welcome Rotonda roundabout where West Avenue meets Quezon and Timog avenues; and in the Ninoy Aquino Parks & Wildlife Center.\n\nAs the San Francisco del Monte River \nUpstream from the confluence with the Mariblo, the river is known as the San Francisco del Monte River. This river in turn divides upstream into the Dario Creek and the Pasong Tam\u00f3 River.\n\nCuli\u00e1t Creek, whose headwaters are within the UP Diliman campus, empties into the Pasong Tam\u00f3 River.\n\nBridges\nThe official portion of the river has 9 bridges which are nearly and exactly located at the borders of Quezon City, San Juan, Mandaluyong and Manila. LRT Line 2 is the only rail bridge crosses the river.\n\nQuezon City\nQuezon Avenue Bridge (Barangays Talayan, Tatalon and Roxas District)\nKaliraya Bridge - carrying Kaliraya Road (Barangays Roxas District and Tatalon)\nMarilao Bridge - carrying E. Rodriguez Sr. Avenue (Barangays Tatalon, Kalusugan and Do\u00f1a Imelda)\nQuezon City-San Juan\nLambingan Bridge - carrying Aurora Boulevard (Barangays Do\u00f1a Imelda and Balong Bato)\nLRT Line 2 (Barangays Do\u00f1a Imelda and Balong Bato)\nSan Juan-Santa Mesa Bridge - carrying Araneta Avenue (Barangays Do\u00f1a Imelda and Progreso)\nSan Juan-Manila\nSan Juan River Bridge - connecting N. Domingo Street and Old Sta. Mesa Street (Barangay Progreso and District of Santa Mesa)\nManila-Mandaluyong \nSevilla Bridge - connecting P. Sanchez Street and Shaw Boulevard (District of Sta. Mesa and Barangay Daang Bakal)\nManila\nLubiran Bridge - connecting Lubiran Street and Rev. Aglipay Street (District of Sta. Mesa)\n\nThe 2 future rail bridges of Metro Rail Transit (MRT) crossing the San Juan River are MRT-4 parallel with Sevilla Bridge located at Manila-Mandaluyong Boundary and MRT-8 located along Quezon Avenue in Quezon City. A simple suspension pedestrian bridge was the last crossing of the river before it met the Pasig River, but was demolished because of the construction of the Skyway Stage 3.\n\nSee also\n List of rivers and estuaries in Metro Manila\n Pasig river rehabilitation\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nRivers of Metro Manila\nSan Juan, Metro Manila", "machine_text": "San Juan River is a river in Metro Manila, Philippines. It is a 7.5-kilometer-long river that flows through the cities of Quezon City, Mandaluyong, San Juan, and Manila. The river is a tributary of Pasig River, which is the main river that flows through Metro Manila. The San Juan River has a significant historical and cultural value as it played a crucial role in the country's history during the Spanish period. It was used as a means of transportation for goods and people, and it was also a strategic location for trading activities. The river was also known for the abundance of fish and other marine life that provided a livelihood for the people living nearby. In recent years, San Juan River has faced environmental challenges due to rapid urbanization and industrialization in Metro Manila, resulting in high levels of pollution and degradation of the river's ecosystem. This prompted the government to take action in rehabilitating the river to improve its water quality and restore its ecological balance. In 2010, the Pasig River Rehabilitation Commission (PRRC) initiated the San Juan River Rehabilitation Program with the aim of cleaning up the river and reviving its natural habitat. The program involved the construction of facilities such as sewage treatment plants and the installation of water quality monitoring systems to ensure that the river's water stays clean and healthy. The San Juan River Rehabilitation Program also engages the local communities in its activities to promote environmental awareness and encourage participation in cleaning up and preserving the river. The program has seen significant improvements in the water quality of the river, and it continues to work towards the full rehabilitation and restoration of the San Juan River's ecosystem. Today, San Juan River is an important part of the Pasig River's ecosystem, and its rehabilitation and preservation serve as a testament to the importance of protecting and conserving the environment for future generations.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 31580275}

Ceci is a driven career woman, focused on work and completely disinterested in having kids.  Alejandro wants children badly, and one day asks Ceci to agree to have a child as soon as possible, but she's not having it.  She's been offered a partnership in the firm she works at, which is a highly unusual promotion for a woman and is very excited about it.\n\nLater that day, as Alejandro is walking down the street, he meets up with a waitress he promised to help if she needs it. She asks him to take her baby, Alan, for 3 days while she takes care of something important. A hesitant Alejandro agrees, and takes Alan.  He brings him home, trying to avoid having Ceci see Alan, but his plan fails and she does not react well. She gets quite angry and insists that he get the baby back to its mother as soon as possible.\n\nThe day Alan's mother is supposed to return comes and goes, so Alex sets out to find her. After a few more days, a friend alerts him that the mother has returned. He brings the baby back to her, and finds out she was being treated for brain cancer in the time she was away. She asks him to adopt the baby, but he refuses. As he begins to leave, she faints and, feeling bad for her, Alejandro brings her and the baby home. Ceci arrives at home just in time to hear him tell Alan's mother that she can stay with them.\n\nThey have a blowout and Alejandro breaks down, essentially admitting that the only reason he married Ceci is so she could have a baby with him.  She goes to a friend's house and they discuss Alejandro's insistence on being a father. He calls, and her friends convince her not to answer the call.\n\nOver the next few days, he continues to try to call her over and over to no avail. Finally, she decides to call him and they connect very briefly, with Ceci asking him not to be home when she comes to get her things.\n\nAlejandro makes plans to adopt the baby and move in with his mother. He heads to work with Alan, which is against office policy. He  is caught by his boss with the kid and immediately gets fired. The next morning, he goes into the office to apologize to his manager and has a conversation with her about how terrible she's been, making suggestions as to how she can improve how the workers regard her.  She rejects his suggestions, but says she'll consider rehiring him.\n\nUltimately, he ends up meeting up with Ceci at a major meeting she's attending for her promotion and they reconcile. As the meeting commences, Alejandro gets a call that Alan's mother has been admitted to the hospital.  Cecilia asks the CEO if she can present up-front and go to the hospital to support her husband, but he tells her it's just a formality and she's already been given the partnership/promotion.  All she needs to do is sign the papers.  She signs, and they head to the hospital.\n\nAlan's mother dies, and Ceci and Alejandro adopt Alan.\n\nThe film closes with Cecilia packing her things to leave for Hong Kong, Alan sleeping on the bed nearby, and Alejandro joking about going to Hong Kong with her.  She gets upset, asking him not to joke because she'll miss him so much, and Alejandro pulls out plane tickets to Hong Kong, confirming that he and Alan will be joining her on her new venture.\n\nCast \n Tato Alexander\n Mois\u00e9s Arizmendi\n Fernando Becerril\n Ver\u00f3nica Bravo\n Mariana Cabrera\n Matteo Giannini\n Juan Mart\u00edn Jauregui\n Ver\u00f3nica Langer\n Montserrat Mara\u00f1on\n Mauricio Ochmann\n Esmeralda Pimentel\n Regina Reynoso\n Tiar\u00e9 Scanda\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n \n \n\n2020 films\nSpanish-language Netflix original films\n2020s Spanish-language films\nMexican films", "machine_text": "You've Got This is a phrase used to motivate and encourage someone who is facing a challenge or adversity.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Peromyscus\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Peromyscus is a genus of rodents. They are commonly referred to as deer mice or deermice, not to be confused with the chevrotain or \"mouse deer\". They are New World mice only distantly related to the common house and laboratory mouse, Mus musculus. From this relative, Peromyscus species are distinguished by relatively larger eyes, and also often two-tone coloring, with darker colors over the dorsum (back), and white abdominal and limb hair-coloring. In reference to the coloring, the word Peromyscus comes from Greek words meaning \"booted mouse\". They are also accomplished jumpers and runners by comparison to house mice, and their common name of \"deer mouse\" (coined in 1833) is in reference to this agility.\n\nThe most common species of deer mice in the continental United States are two closely related species, P. maniculatus and P. leucopus. In the United States, Peromyscus is the most populous mammalian genus overall, and has become notorious in the western United States as a carrier of hantaviruses.\n\nReservoir of human disease\n\nHantavirus \nThe deer mouse came to the attention of the public when it was discovered to be the primary reservoir species for Sin Nombre hantavirus.\n\nLyme disease \nA recent study in British Columbia of 218 deer mice showed 30% (66) were seropositive for Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme disease.\n\nOther diseases \nEhrlichiosis and babesiosis are also carried by the deer mouse.\n\nUse as a laboratory animal \nWhile wild populations are sometimes studied, Peromyscus species are also easy to breed and keep in captivity, although they are more energetic and difficult to handle than the relatively more tame M. musculus. For certain studies, they are also favored over the laboratory mouse (M. musculus domestica) and the laboratory rat (Rattus norvegicus domestica).  Apart from their importance in studying infectious diseases, Peromyscus species are useful for studying phylogeography, speciation, chromosomes, genetics, ecology, population genetics, conservation and evolution in general.  They are also useful for researching repetitive-movement disorders. Their use in aging research is because Peromyscus spp., despite being of similar size to the standard laboratory mouse, have maximum lifespans of 5\u20137 years, compared to the 3-year maximum lifespan of ad libitum-fed laboratory strains or wild-caught M. musculus.\n\nThe Peromyscus Genetic Stock Center at the University of South Carolina was established by Professor Wallace Dawson in 1985 to raise animals of the peromyscine species for research and educational use. This institute maintains populations of several different species (including Peromyscus californicus, Peromyscus maniculatus, Peromyscus melanophrys, Peromyscus eremicus, and Peromyscus aztecus).

There are 56 recognized species of Peromyscus, with the majority of them being found in the United States and Mexico. Deer mice are found in a variety of habitats, including forests, grasslands, and deserts. The physical characteristics of Peromyscus are similar among the different species. They have grayish-brown fur, with a white underbelly and large eyes. Their tails are long and scaly, and their hind legs are longer than their front legs. Most species of Peromyscus are nocturnal and primarily feed on seeds, fruits, and insects. Deer mice are important members of many North American ecosystems, serving as a prey base for predators such as snakes, birds of prey, and carnivorous mammals. In addition to their ecological importance, some species of Peromyscus are used in scientific research. They are genetically similar to humans, making them a useful model organism for studying genetics and disease. Peromyscus have been important to indigenous peoples for millennia. They are an important food source, and their fur was used for clothing and other items. Some Native American tribes also believed that deer mice had medicinal properties and used them to treat various ailments. Despite their abundance and importance, some species of Peromyscus are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation. Climate change and the spread of non-native species are also emerging threats to deer mice and their ecosystems. Conservation efforts, including habitat restoration and protection, are crucial for the survival of these important rodents.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1166759}

Transmissions were broadcast between 87.3 and 87.5 MHz in FM, so that their characteristic modulations could be heard on mainstream FM radio receivers.\n\nHistory \nEurosignal was introduced in Germany in 1974, France in 1975, and Switzerland in 1985. In France and Switzerland, transmissions were stopped on 31 December 1997 and 1 April 1998, respectively.\n\nOperation\n\nUtilization \nA receiver could handle up to four phone numbers. It included an acoustic signal and four optical signals that indicated which of the four numbers called. Eurosignal did not allow other transmissions; the actual four telephone numbers had to be established previously, and use of the signal was limited to telephones. Eurosignal numbers were not listed in a directory in order to limit abuse. Eurosignal had a major advantage over other radiotelephone networks due to its costs, which were about 10% of ordinary phone lines. It also enjoyed a larger coverage area compared to FM radio.\n\nBroadcast network \nData was transmitted by radio VHF. The following four channels were used.\n\n Channel A: 87.340\u00a0MHz\n Channel B: 87.365\u00a0MHz\n Channel C: 87.390\u00a0MHz\n Channel D: 87.415\u00a0MHz\n\nGermany used channels A and B, France used all four, and Switzerland used only channel D. The distribution network was composed of terrestrial transmitters with power of up to 2 kilowatts.\n\nModulation \nEurosignal was based on audio transmissions, at first using amplitude modulation, later using frequency modulation. In general, each digit of the phone number produced a particular frequency. Thus, the number 123456 resulted in the issuance of the frequencies f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6. If a number was repeated, its second occurrence was replaced by a particular frequency indicating repetition, fr. For example, the number 111111 was encoded by f1, fr, f1, fr, f1, fr. Two phone numbers were separated by the frequency fi for at least 0.22 seconds, with a time per called number of 0.82 seconds.\n\nThe frequencies used were as follows:\n\nIn popular culture\nThe distinctive audio tones of Eurosignal were sampled by Loopzone in \"Mega htz\" from 1993, Karl Bartos in \"Overdrive\" on his 1993 album Esperanto, as well as by the French electronica duo Air on their 1996 single B-side \"Les Professionnels\", available on their compilation album Premiers Sympt\u00f4mes (1997).\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n Eurosignal Technik (German)\n Longest sequence \n Video on Eurosignal (German)\n\nRadio paging", "machine_text": "Eurosignal is a technology that is used to enhance communication and signal transmission in different types of networks such as railway, telecommunication, and transportation. This technology was developed by the Belgian company Eurosignal NV to address the challenges of signal transmission and communication in railway and other types of networks. One of the main applications of Eurosignal is in railway signaling. The technology is used to enhance the transmission and reception of signals between the track and the train. It enables the speedy and accurate communication between the trackside devices and the train's onboard equipment, improving safety, reliability, and efficiency of railway operations. Another application of Eurosignal is in telecommunication networks. The technology is used to improve the transmission of digital signals over long distances without the need for signal amplification. It also enhances the transfer of high-speed internet and data communication as well as voice transmission. Eurosignal is also used in transportation systems such as airports, highways, and sea ports. In these systems, it helps to improve the communication between the various components, enabling accurate real-time traffic monitoring and control. One of the most significant benefits of Eurosignal is its ability to work on a wide range of frequencies, making it suitable for different types of networks. The technology is also modular, allowing it to be upgraded to meet changing needs and requirements. In conclusion, Eurosignal is a critical technology that has enhanced communication and signal transmission in different types of networks. Its flexibility, reliability, and the ability to upgrade make it a valuable asset in different industries that rely on signal transmission and communication.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 44756771}

The Provincial Secretary was the equivalent of the former Canadian Cabinet position of Secretary of State for Canada. Like its federal counterpart it included an eclectic variety of responsibilities that were not assigned to other ministers, most of which would eventually evolve into portfolios of their own. The provincial secretary was also responsible for official communications between the provincial government and the Colonial Office in London as well as with other provincial and colonial governments (and after 1867 the federal government). As well, the position also included various duties related to ceremonial occasions, visits by dignitaries, protocol, relations between the government and the office of lieutenant governor and commemorative events particularly in relation to the monarchy.\n\nGenerally, the Provincial Secretary acted as a province's Registrar-General and was responsible for formal documents and records such as licences, birth and death certificates, land registries and surveys, business registrations and writs. As well, the position was generally responsible for the administration of the civil service and of elections. Provincial secretaries were usually the most senior member of the provincial cabinet outside of the Premier, and the office holder was often designated as Acting Premier when the Premier was out of province, ill or otherwise unavailable. The last individual to hold the position of Provincial Secretary and Registrar (renamed Provincial Secretary and Minister of Citizenship in 1961) was John Yaremko who left office in 1975.\n\nIn 1972 the Progressive Conservative government of Bill Davis adopted the provincial secretary title for a non-departmental cabinet portfolio in which the occupant either having responsibility spreading over several ministries, assisting a senior minister in an area or as a secondary portfolio for a senior minister giving him a broader responsibility or mandate area. The three positions created were Provincial Secretary for Social Development, Provincial Secretary for Justice and Provincial Secretary for Resource Development. These positions were unrelated to the original Provincial Secretary position except for the common name. The positions were retained by Davis' successor, Frank Miller, in 1985 but were abolished when the Progressive Conservatives lost power to David Peterson's Liberals in 1985.\n\nPre-Confederation Provincial Secretary\nPrior to Confederation and the creation of the office of Premier, the Provincial Secretary was the most important and powerful figure in provincial politics.

Sting won at first, but Claw used their powerplay 'repeat' and on the second time, Claw won. This was, arguably, inevitable, as Sting's Joe had to win the first time to keep himself in the game: at this point Claw's Ayesha could choose not to deploy Repeat if she won first time. Having hardly tried the first time, Ayesha flew across, trouncing an exhausted Joe.\nHighway/Shadow Mountain - To win the teams must traverse the valley below the mountain on wires 20 metres above the forest floor. The teams must climb the 1500 metre mountain tied together while planting their flags as they go, the first team to summit and raise their final flag will escape and win. Claw won this as they had a huge time advantage and Kyran had breathing problems and Oscar hurt himself on the other team. Claw were awarded with a trip to another tropical island where Caroline and Reggie were waiting with smoothies and mobile-phones so they could call their family before they started the long journey home.\n\nControversy\nBullying Incident\nSeason 1 of Scorpion Island started with two less contestants than expected. Unconfirmed Reports suggest that this was due to one contestant's attempts to ostracise another from the group. Both contestants left the group before filming commenced, despite the producers attempts to reconcile the situation. To date this is the only known case of a child being blacklisted from any future CBBC productions.\n\nReferences\n\n2007 British television seasons", "machine_text": "Escape from Scorpion Island (series 1) is a British children's reality television series that aired on BBC One from 3 September 2007 to 8 November 2007.

The show follows 12 young contestants aged between 11 and 13, who are stranded on a deserted island in the South Pacific for six weeks. The island is fraught with dangers, including scorpions and venomous snakes. The contestants have to complete various challenges to earn gold coins, which they can use to buy food, water, and other supplies. The ultimate goal is to escape from the island by building a raft and sailing to safety. The challenges were both physical and mental, and some required the contestants to work together, while others were solo efforts. The challenges included climbing a volcano, crossing raging rapids, and navigating through treacherous caves. The contestants also had to find hidden clues and solve puzzles to progress in the game. Throughout the series, the contestants faced a number of twists and turns, including the arrival of new contestants halfway through the competition and surprise eliminations. The contestants had to vote off one of their own each week, and the two remaining contestants had to face a final challenge to determine the winner. The first series of Escape from Scorpion Island was a huge success, with an average of 1.7 million viewers per episode.

NGC 3175 has a diameter of approximately 50,000 light-years and has an apparent magnitude of 10.7, making it visible in backyard telescopes. It has a bright, central bulge that is surrounded by a flattened disk of gas, dust, and stars. This disk is characterized by spiral arms that are adorned with young, hot stars and regions of star formation. The galaxy also has a small bar of stars running through its center, which is thought to play a role in funneling gas and dust towards the central bulge and possibly triggering star formation. NGC 3175 is also known to have a supermassive black hole at its center, with a mass estimated to be around 10 million times that of the Sun. Observations of NGC 3175 have revealed several interesting features, including a ring of gas and dust that encircles the central bulge, as well as a number of faint dwarf galaxies that appear to be interacting with the larger spiral galaxy. These interactions could potentially trigger further star formation and lead to the eventual merging of these galaxies. NGC 3175 is an important object of study for astronomers, who use it to better understand the nature and evolution of spiral galaxies.

The Durance flows  away below a plateau which grows mainly cereals and apples and also supports some livestock.\n\nOrigin of the name\nThe most common theory is that name comes from the Latin Vallis Mellis which is translated as valley of honey. Charles Rostaing suggested that the name sounds like a word for mountain and so this might be its origin. Ernest N\u00e8gre proposed that the name is composed of Latin 'vallem' and the Roman name 'Maelius'.\n\nHistory\nThe village was mentioned, as 'Vaumel', for the first time in charters dated 1171.

He was a Knight of the Military Order of Calatrava.\n\nEarly life\n\nBorn in Madrid, he came from an aristocratic Galician family, whose homestead was near Santiago de Compostela. His father was Juan Fern\u00e1ndez de Caama\u00f1o, and his mother, Mariana Moraleja Alocen. He entered the Spanish Navy (Armada) at the age of 18, and two years later he was an Ensign (Alf\u00e9rez de Navio).\n\nExplorations\nA few years later he formed part of a politico-commercial expedition to Constantinople to establish business relations with Turkey, Poland, and Russia. After a quick trip to Cuba in 1787, he was chosen by Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra to go to the Pacific Coast of Mexico and the naval base of San Blas, the headquarters for the exploration of the Pacific Northwest. He was a Frigate Lieutenant (Teniente de Fragata) at the time. Alongside went his brother-in-law, Francisco de Eliza, who would distinguish himself as Governor of Fort San Miguel on Vancouver Island's Nootka Sound. On their ship to Mexico was the recently named Viceroy of New Spain, Don Juan Vicente de G\u00fcemes Padilla Horcasitas y Aguayo, 2nd Count of Revillagigedo. On February 3, 1790, Caama\u00f1o took part on an expedition to the Pacific Northwest. He was commanding the Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Rosario (also known as the La Princesa), a 189-ton frigate built in San Blas for the exploration of the North. He did not go beyond Nootka on this voyage, but on his next one, in 1792, came as far as Bucareli Bay commanding the frigate Ar\u00e1nzazu, a corvette built at Cavite in the Philippines. By this time he had been promoted to Ship Lieutenant (Teniente de Nav\u00edo). This expedition did a thorough study of the coast from Bucareli to Nootka, marking the map of Alaska and British Columbia with many names which are there today. Sailing from Nootka on June 13, 1792, Caama\u00f1o explored Bucareli Bay, off Prince of Wales Island, Alaska, and anchored in Dixon Entrance on July 20. Then he explored southward, passing through Principe Channel, Nepean Sound, Whale Sound, near the Estevan Group archipelago, then into Caama\u00f1o Sound and south through Laredo Channel, between Aristazabal Island and Princess Royal Island, returning to Nootka on September 7, 1792. He named Principe Channel, Laredo Channel, Campania Island, Campania Sound, Aristazabal Island, Gil Island and Gravina Island after Federico Gravina). George Vancouver adopted these names for his chart.\n\nLater career and family\nHaving successfully completed his trip to Alaska, Caama\u00f1o was sent, after a brief stay in San Blas, across the Pacific Ocean to the Philippines. From 1794 to 1807 he served at various posts between Mexico and Peru, having married on one of those trips the Ecuadorian, Francisca de Arteta Santistevan, who gave him eight children. In 1820 he was still living in Guayaquil, the birthplace of his youngest daughter, but nothing is known of the date and place of his death. Some of his descendants, the Caama\u00f1o family, have been historically prominent in Ecuador, most notably his grandson, Jos\u00e9 Pl\u00e1cido Caama\u00f1o, who became president of the Republic. Also noted is his great-grandson, Jacinto Jij\u00f3n y Caama\u00f1o, a noted aristocrat, historian and politician; as well as another great-grandson, the poet Ernesto Noboa y Caama\u00f1o, among others.\n\nLegacy\nCamano Island, an island in Puget Sound, was named to honor Jacinto Caama\u00f1o, as was Caama\u00f1o Sound, British Columbia, on the northern limit of which there is also Jacinto Island.  Other Spanish names in the immediate vicinity of Caama\u00f1o Sound are Campania Sound, Estevan Point (named by Juan Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rez Hern\u00e1ndez) and Aristazabal Island.

He rose to national recognition as the leader of a faction of rebels that opposed the military coup that overthrew the government of Juan Bosch, the country\u2019s first democratically elected president. Born in Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic, Caama\u00f1o began his military career at the Dominican Naval School at the age of 16. He later pursued naval studies in the United States, graduating from the United States Naval Academy and the Naval Postgraduate School. He served in the navy for over two decades, during which he was promoted to the rank of rear admiral. After the 1963 election of President Bosch, the Dominican Republic became embroiled in political turmoil. Just seven months after taking office, Bosch was deposed in a military coup led by a junta of generals. In a bid to restore democracy, Caama\u00f1o led a group of rebel soldiers to engage in a protracted struggle against the military junta. Caama\u00f1o became known for his bravery and strategic intelligence. He symbolized the struggle against authoritarianism in the country and gained the support of many. In April 1965, after two years of exile in Venezuela, he led a team of 12 men in a daring amphibious landing in Santo Domingo, sparking a popular uprising against the military government. Under his leadership, Caama\u00f1o\u2019s rebels, known as the Constitutionalists, held a significant territory in the capital, and their military prowess forced the interim administration to negotiate. The negotiation saw the return of Bosch to the presidency for just a few months, until he was again ousted by another military claim. Caama\u00f1o continued his fight until ultimately facing the military leaders' repressive forces, which outnumbered and overpowered his rebel army in 1966. He went into exile again, moving to Venezuela, where he remained until 1973, when he returned to the Dominican Republic with the intention of reigniting the revolution. He died in a clash with the army on February 16, 1973. Since his death, Caama\u00f1o has been celebrated as a national hero in the Dominican Republic, and has had streets, parks, and monuments erected in his honor. His legacy of courage, patriotism, and defense of democracy is considered one of the most significant attributes to the country's political history.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 8492970}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Frank McDonough\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Frank McDonough is a British historian of the Third Reich and international history.\n\nLife\n\nFrancis [Frank] Xavier McDonough was born on 17 April 1957 in Liverpool. He read modern History at Balliol College, Oxford, as a Senior Status Scholar. He was at Balliol at the same time as Boris Johnson and knew him. He later earned a PhD in history from Lancaster University, under the supervision of Ruth Henig. He was Professor of International History in the History Department of the School of Humanities and Social Science at Liverpool John Moores University until his retirement in 2021. He is an avid Liverpool F.C. fan and still lives in Liverpool with his partner Ann.\n\nWork\nHis key area of research is international history, particularly Anglo-German relations in the 20th century. He has published significant works on the origins of World War I and World War II. McDonough is increasingly publishing his research on the Third Reich, including opposition to Hitler, the Holocaust and the Gestapo.\n\nNeville Chamberlain and appeasement\n\nIn his study of Neville Chamberlain, Appeasement and the British Road to War, published in 1998, McDonough outlined a 'post revisionist' theory, which built on the work of R. A. C. Parker's 1994 book Chamberlain and Appeasement, by expanding it to include appeasement in society and looking at economic appeasement, the mass media and the opponents of appeasement. McDonough accepted that appeasement was probably the only choice for the British government in the 1930s, but unlike the revisionists he argued that it was poorly implemented, carried out too late and not enforced strongly enough to constrain Hitler. He suggested that appeasement must be analysed as a usable policy at the time it operated and focus on how Chamberlain's personality played a crucial role in the conduct of the policy, in particular, his errors of judgement, his failure to listen to opponents and his unwillingness to try any alternatives. McDonough argues that Chamberlain's version of appeasement, as operated by such an inflexible politician, unwilling to change direction, until events forced him to, actually contributed to Britain and France entering the war in 1939 in a much weaker strategic position, and passed the early advantage in the war to Hitler's regime, which meant that Germany only faced one European front until June 1944.\n\nThe study was reviewed in academic journals. Parker described it as \"very well written, with a lively argument, which explores appeasement in society too\". Andrew Thorpe, a leading authority on foreign affairs, described the book as \"a cogent and stimulating analysis of appeasement which will take the debate still deeper\". A leading US historian of foreign affairs from the Reed College, Edward B. Segel, commented: \"The book brings out effectively how the British government manipulated the mass-media, the press and especially the BBC to exclude public criticism of Chamberlain's policies and convey the impression of overwhelming support\".\n\nMcDonough is one of the most prominent 'post-revisionist' experts on Neville Chamberlain and the policy of appeasement, along with Parker, who was, as Sydney Aster points out, his \"academic mentor while he was at Oxford\".\n\nOther books\n\nIn McDonough's 2007 monograph, The Conservative Party and Anglo-German Relations, 1905\u20131914, published by Palgrave Macmillan, he moved the focus of analysis to the Conservative Party's role in the outbreak of the First World War. The study was described in a review in the journal The Bulletin of the German Institute of Historical Research by a German foreign policy scholar as \"a thorough and thought-provoking analysis, which draws on over thirty archives and provides a powerful and overdue corrective to the traditional depiction of the Edwardian Conservative Party as 'Scaremongers' and the chief promoters of Germanophobic views among British political parties in the years that led to the outbreak of the First World War\".\n\nIn addition, to his research on Anglo-German relations, McDonough has written a number of publications on the related subject of the history of the Third Reich, most notably, Hitler and Nazi Germany (1999); Opposition and Resistance in Nazi Germany (2001); and Hitler and the Rise of the Nazi Party (2003).\n\nAmong his other books are: The Origins of the First and Second World Wars (1997); The British Empire, 1815\u20131914 (1994); and Hitler, Chamberlain and Appeasement (2002). In 1998, McDonough was commissioned by the Oxford and Cambridge Examinations Board to write a set text entitled Fascism, Conflict and Communism: European History: 1890\u20131945.\n\nIn recent years, McDonough's published work has been focused on aspects of the history of the Third Reich.\n\nIn 2008, McDonough published The Holocaust, with John Cochrane. This book is a new introduction to both the events and the complex international response to the Holocaust and examines the grim reality of life and death in the death camps, the scholarly debates and the impact on popular culture since 1945 of the most horrific aspect of the history of the 20th century.\n\nMcDonough is the author of an English-language biography of the German resistance heroine, Sophie Scholl, entitled Sophie Scholl: The Woman Who Defied Hitler, published by the History Press in February 2009.\n\nIn September 2011, McDonough published The Origins of the Second World War: An international Perspective, about the outbreak of the Second World War.\n\nIn April 2012, the second edition of \"Hitler and the Rise of the Nazi Party\" was published.\n\nIn August 2015, McDonough's study The Gestapo: The Myth and Reality of Hitler's Secret Police was published by the Hodder and Stoughton imprint Coronet. The book is based on original Gestapo files and tells the story of the victims of Nazi Terror. The book has been published in translated versions in Italy (March 2016), Spain (June 2016), Norway (August 2016), Sweden (September 2016), Finland (2016) and Romania (2019).\n\nThe paperback version of the Gestapo book was released in September 2016 \n\nMcDonough has most recently completed a two volume book titled 'The Hitler Years'. The first volume (Triumph 1933\u20131939) is due to be published on 14 November 2019.\n\nMedia appearances and Twitter\nMcDonough has also appeared on TV and radio. He appeared on CrossTalk on Russia Today in 2010, debating whether the Second World War could have been prevented. He featured in the BBC 1 documentary A Tale of Two Rival Cities, which was part of the BBC's \"History of the World\" project, for which he also acted as Historical Consultant; the documentary won a Royal Television Society Award. He was interviewed in two special programmes on French National Television to mark the 70th anniversary of General de Gaulle's 18 June 1940 speech when he said the \"flame of French Resistance cannot be extinguished\". McDonough appeared as an historical commentator on France 2 and in a special documentary featuring historians on de Gaulle, broadcast on France 3 on 18 June 2010. He also appeared in the BBC 1 programme Inside Out commenting on a story presented by the actor Paul McGann that looked at whether or not Adolf Hitler visited Liverpool between November 1911 and May 1912. McDonough argued that evidence from Austrian police records, eyewitness accounts from Vienna, and shipping records all strongly indicated that the young Hitler had lived in Vienna at this time, not Liverpool, thus confirming what Hitler claimed in his autobiography, Mein Kampf. In 2012, McDonough appeared in a series on the history of the Third Reich on National Geographic channel entitled Nazi Secrets. He appeared in three episodes: \"Hitler's Damned Women\", \"Hitler's Family Skeletons\" and \"Hitler's Millions\". In November 2013, McDonough was featured in a BBC 1 documentary called The Story of the Swastika and a Channel 5 documentary called 7 Days That Made the F\u00fchrer. In 2014, McDonough appeared in a 10-part documentary series called The Rise of the Nazi Party on Quest TV, part of the Discovery Channel.\n\nMcDonough has a Twitter account called @FXMC1957. It examines key facts in history every morning. McDonough often does Twitter lectures that cover issues such as the JFK assassination, D-Day and the outbreak of WW1 in great depth. He rarely tweets much about his work, his private life or his opinions. The History News Network ranked McDonough's Twitter in the Top 20 History Twitter accounts.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Professor Frank McDonough's official website\n \n \n \"Adolf Hitler Liverpool links discussed in new BBC documentary\", Liverpool Echo, 28 November 2011\n\nLiving people\n1957 births\nHistorians of Nazism\nEnglish historians\nAcademics of Liverpool John Moores University\nAlumni of Balliol College, Oxford\nAlumni of Lancaster University\nAcademics from Liverpool", "machine_text": "Frank McDonough is a British historian and writer.

It was established as a shipping station on the Florida Railroad that ran from Fernandina through Gainesville to Cedar Key, largely absorbing an earlier community called Kanapaha. The Florida Railroad later became part of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad, which abandoned the line from Archer to Cedar Key in 1932. The tracks were removed in the 1970s. \n\nThe name of the community comes from the Arredondo Grant, a Spanish land grant that includes much of Alachua County and parts of Levy and Marion counties. A post office opened in Arredondo in 1873 and remained in service until 1925.\n\nThe area around Arredondo was used to raise cattle in the middle of the 19th century, and some cattle-raising continued into the 1880s.  In the 1850s, cotton growers from South Carolina established plantations, including the Haile Homestead, in the area, which was then called Kanapaha. The soil around Arredondo is fertile, with underlying deposits of phosphate rock contributing to the fertility. After the Civil War, the cotton planters and newcomers to the area turned to vegetable, fruit and tree-nut production. In the 1883 season, 80,000 crates of vegetables were shipped from the Arredondo station. Strawberries shipped to New York in early February sold for $3.00 a quart.\n\nFarmers began experimenting with the commercial production of tomatoes in the area of Arredondo in 1870. In 1872,  were planted to tomatoes, and Arredondo became the center of tomato-growing in Florida. Tomatoes were a profitable crop. In 1882, Florida tomatoes sold for $4.00 to $4.50 per bushel crate in Chicago. As railroads extended further south in Florida, tomato-growing also moved south, permitting an earlier harvest for shipment to the north. Commercial tomato growing, and commercial vegetable growing in general, had ceased in the area around Arredondo by 1900.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\nUnincorporated communities in Alachua County, Florida\nUnincorporated communities in Florida", "machine_text": "Arredondo is a small unincorporated community located in Alachua County, Florida, United States.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Karl Stromberg\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Karl Sigmund Stromberg is a fictional character and the main antagonist in the 1977 James Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me. Stromberg was portrayed by Curd J\u00fcrgens. The character Stromberg was created specifically for the film by writer Christopher Wood. Ian Fleming's novel The Spy Who Loved Me was not told from Bond's perspective, but, rather, a Bond girl who is in love with him. The entire plot of the film has actually nothing to do at all with the plot of the novel. This was at Fleming's request; when he sold the rights to his novel to Eon Productions he requested only the title be used.\n\nBiography\n\nThe webbed-fingered Karl Stromberg is a successful self-employed businessman as head of his own shipping firm and chain of laboratories. Stromberg's obsession and passion is the ocean where he lives in his palace, named Atlantis, that could submerge itself underwater so as not to be seen or detected. Located off the coast of Sardinia, Italy, Atlantis has everything to support life above and below water for any length of time. In fact, Atlantis is more like a city, able to support dozens if not hundreds of people. Stromberg also owns a huge tanker, named Liparus, that serves as his headquarters away from Atlantis. Aboard the tanker he has a small army of red soldiers. In Christopher Wood's novelisation of the film, Stromberg is Swedish and his first name is \"Sigmund\".\n\nScheme\nAlthough Stromberg has a passion for the ocean and its various species, he despises the human race, not unlike Jules Verne's Captain Nemo. Stromberg, however, is much more diabolical and has no interest in benefiting the world. He has a congenital condition in which his hands are webbed like those of aquatic birds or mammals. It is his personal mission to start over with a new civilisation underwater via complete anarchy against the \"surface world\". After contracting two scientists to create the technology to track nuclear submarines, Stromberg uses this technology to capture a Soviet nuclear submarine and a British submarine. By tracking the subs, Stromberg's specially adapted tanker, Liparus, sneaks up on the subs, forces them to the surface through methods using some kind of high frequencies to disrupt the sub's electrical system and captures them inside the tanker. His plan calls for the firing of nuclear missiles from these subs at Moscow and New York City, thus framing each other's government and starting a nuclear war, which would wipe out every last human being on Earth. Among Stromberg's many minions were an assistant who betrayed him by trying to sell the plans for the submarine tracking system, and a professor and a doctor who were to help him operate the tracking system after it was complete. He killed his assistant by feeding her to a shark, and killed the professor and the doctor, having outlived their usefulness, by blowing up their helicopter. (In a comic relief after cancelling the payment to the professor and doctor he has his secretary inform the two men's families that they have met with an accident and are \"buried at sea\".)\n\nThis scheme is similar to that of an earlier Bond film, You Only Live Twice, which posited stealing space capsules to start a war between the Soviets and the Americans. The idea of commandeering two nuclear missiles and attempting to fire them at two major cities likewise recalls the plot of Thunderball. The scheme in which the villain wishes to destroy mankind to create a new race or new civilisation was also used in Moonraker, the next film after The Spy Who Loved Me. In Moonraker, the villain Hugo Drax has an obsession with restarting human civilisation in outer space, although Drax's plans were to eventually return to Earth, unlike Stromberg. The film Moonraker was also written by Christopher Wood. Both Stromberg and Drax have hired Jaws as a henchman.\n\nPrevention\nStromberg's scheme is foiled after Bond is taken aboard the Liparus as a prisoner from a recently captured American submarine. With Bond's help, the crews from the submarines escape and take over the tanker. With the tanker under their control, Bond is able to order the stolen submarines, which were crewed by Stromberg's men, to fire their nuclear warheads at each other. Prior to this, however, Stromberg had abducted Bond's partner, the Russian agent Anya Amasova, and escaped to his city-ship, Atlantis.\n\nBond pursues Stromberg, and after two failed attempts by Stromberg to kill him (including the use of an explosive harpoon which ran the length of a dinner table), Bond exercises his licence to kill by shooting Stromberg multiple times in the groin and chest. Atlantis is later torpedoed and sunk, giving Stromberg a burial at sea.\n\nHenchmen\n Jaws - survived\n Naomi - blown up by Bond\n Sandor - thrown off the edge of a building by Bond\n Liparus Captain - fatally wounded by an explosion\n Professor Markowitz - blown up in helicopter explosion\n Dr. Bechmann - blown up in helicopter explosion\n Kate Chapman - eaten by shark\n Captain, Stromberg 1 (formerly Soviet submarine Potemkin) - nuked, along with his entire crew, by Stromberg 2\n Captain, Stromberg 2 (formerly British submarine HMS Ranger) - nuked, along with his entire crew, by Stromberg 1\n Motorbike Henchman - blinded and sent off a cliff\n Three Men in Jaws' car - all killed in car crash\n A small army of red soldiers\n\nSee also\nList of James Bond villains\nJames Bond in film\n\nReferences\n\nBond villains\nFictional German people\nFictional Swedish people\nJames Bond characters\nFictional businesspeople\nFictional dictators\nFictional warlords\nThe Spy Who Loved Me (film)\nFilm characters introduced in 1977\nFictional terrorists\nMale literary villains\nMale film villains\nAction film villains\nFilm supervillains", "machine_text": "Karl Stromberg was a fictional character who appeared as the main antagonist in the 1977 James Bond film, The Spy Who Loved Me. He was portrayed by actor Curt Jurgens. Stromberg was a billionaire industrialist who had a deep-seated hatred for humanity and believed that the underwater world was the future. He had a plan to create a new civilization under the sea by using a stolen nuclear submarine and a network of underwater cities, where only his selected few would be allowed to live. To achieve his goal, he planned to trigger a nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union, hoping that the resulting chaos would provide him with the opportunity to take control of the world. He also had a team of henchmen, such as Jaws and Sandor, who helped him to carry out his evil plans. Stromberg's lair was a massive underwater base with a retractable roof that resembled a giant volcano. The base had various amenities, including a laboratory, dining area, and a control room that monitored his underwater cities. James Bond, played by actor Roger Moore, was tasked with stopping Stromberg and his evil plans. Bond infiltrated his underwater base, fought off his henchmen, and ultimately defeated Stromberg in a thrilling final battle. Despite his defeat, Stromberg remains a memorable villain in the James Bond franchise. His character was praised for being a formidable opponent to Bond, with a unique and elaborate plan that matched his wealthy status.

As of the 2010 census, the population was 10,407. Its seat is Harrisonburg, on the Ouachita River. The parish was formed in 1808, shortly after the United States acquired this territory in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803.\n\nHistory\n\nPrehistory\n\nCatahoula Parish was the home to many succeeding Native American groups in the thousands of years before European settlements began. Peoples of the Marksville culture, Troyville culture, Coles Creek culture and Plaquemine culture built villages and mound sites throughout the area. Notable examples include Peck Mounds, and the Troyville Earthworks. The Troyville Earthworks have components dating from 100 BCE to 700 CE during the Baytown to the Troyville-Coles Creek periods.\n\nIt once had the tallest mound in Louisiana at  in height; it was the second-tallest mound in North America (after Monk's Mound at Cahokia Mounds). This mound was destroyed to make way for the Jonesville bridge over the Black River.\n\nHistoric era\nThis area was settled primarily by migrants from the southern United States after the Louisiana Purchase, when the US acquired the vast, former French-claimed territory west of the Mississippi River. White migrants to north and central Louisiana were from the South, and were mainly of British descent and Protestant religions. They brought a new influence into Louisiana. Some also brought or purchased African-American slaves to work on larger plantations. Many of these were from the Upper South, which sold slaves through the domestic market. They brought their own cultural influences as well.\n\nThe parish was founded in 1808 and originally incorporated a very large area. As population increased in the region, new parishes were organized from the territory first included in Catahoula Parish. The parish was divided by the state in 1910, when La Salle Parish was formed from its old western section. As one of the new parishes organized during early United States settlement of this part of the state, it has had the third most boundary changes since that time. Only Natchitoches and Ouachita parishes have had more revisions of boundaries.\n\nAt the start of the American Civil War, James G. Taliaferro, who had been a judge in the parish and was a delegate to the Louisiana state secessionist convention from Catahoula Parish, argued strongly against leaving the American Union. Taliaferro \"denied the constitutional right [of a state] to leave the Union and painted a gloomy picture of economic chaos, blighted prosperity, staggering taxation and 'fatal prostration of Louisiana's interests under a southern Confederation,' and he could see no way ahead to prevent final anarchy and war. So 'radical' were the ideas of Taliaferro that the convention refused to print his protest in the pages of [its journal].\" He is buried along with his wife and many other membera of his family in Alexander Cemetery in Manifest, Louisiana.\n\nCatahoula dog\n\nCatahoula Parish lays claim to its namesake Catahoula Leopard dog breed. The Catahoula breed was owned by Colonel James \"Jim\" Bowie of the Alamo and his brother Rezin Bowie, both of Louisiana. During the early 1900s, Theodore Roosevelt used the Catahoula when hunting.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Blue iguana\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The blue iguana (Cyclura lewisi), also known as the Grand Cayman ground iguana, Grand Cayman blue iguana or Cayman Island rock iguana, is an endangered species of lizard which is endemic to the island of Grand Cayman. It was previously considered to be a subspecies of the Cuban iguana, Cyclura nubila, but in a 2004 article Frederic J. Burton reclassified it as a separate species because according to him the genetic differences discovered four years earlier between the different C. nubila populations warranted this interpretation. The blue iguana is one of the longest-living species of lizard (possibly up to 69\u00a0years).\n\nThe preferred habitat for the blue iguana is rocky, sunlit, open areas in dry forests or near the shore, as the females must dig holes in the sand to lay eggs in June and July. A possible second clutch is laid in September. The blue iguana's herbivorous diet includes plants, fruits, and flowers. Its color is tan to gray with a bluish cast that is more pronounced during the breeding season and more so in males. It is large and heavy-bodied with a dorsal crest of short spines running from the base of the neck to the end of the tail.\n\nThe iguana was possibly abundant before European colonization; but fewer than 15\u00a0animals remained in the wild by 2003, and this wild population was predicted to become extinct within the first decade of the 21st century. The species' decline is mainly being driven by predation by cats and dogs, and indirectly by reduction in suitable habitat as fruit farms are converted to pasture for cattle grazing. Since 2004, hundreds of captive-bred animals have been released into a preserve on Grand Cayman run by a partnership headed by the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, in an attempt to save the species. At least five non-profit organizations are working with the government of the Cayman Islands to ensure the survival of the blue iguana.\n\nTaxonomy\nIts specific name lewisi commemorates the name of the scientist who collected the holotype of this species, Charles Bernard Lewis.\n\nThe closest relatives are the Cuban iguana (Cyclura nubila) and the Northern Bahamian rock iguana (C. cychlura). It can be genetically distinguished from the subspecies found on Little Cayman and Cayman Brac known as C. nubila caymanensis, although it can interbreed with this subspecies and produce fertile offspring.\n\nIn 1938 Lewis of the Institute of Jamaica joined an Oxford University biological expedition to the Cayman Islands. Lewis obtained two blue iguanas, a male and a female, which were later lodged with the Natural History Museum, London. Chapman Grant, in an article published in 1940, formally described the blue iguana as an separate taxon for the first time, classifying it as the trinomial C. macleayi lewisi. Albert Schwartz and Richard Thomas reclassified it as C. nubila lewisi in 1975, making it a subspecies of the Cuban iguana. In his 2004 article Frederick Burton repeatedly states Schwartz and Carey reclassified it in a 1977 publication, but he is mistaken.\n\nBurton, who runs the captive breeding program on the island, reclassified the blue iguana as a distinct species in 2004. Although it has almost identical head scale counts and patterns as C. nubila, most individuals of this taxon often have five auricular spines in as opposed to four in caymanensis, although this is not diagnostic, and individuals of the nominate subspecies shows either morphologies in similar proportions. Also most lewisi have an extra pair scales behind the prefrontals, although not always and individuals from the other populations may also have these. Thus Burton concluded that using scale characteristics these three taxa could not be told apart in a consistent manner. According to him most important difference between the lewisi population and the other two is skin color. Although skin color is a variable characteristic that is usually considered unsatisfactory in taxonomy, Burton thought that in this instance it might be appropriate. Although all three taxa hatch with the same color, as they grow older lewisi becomes more uniformly bluish, whereas the other taxa can be more variable in coloration, although Burton states that this characteristic is not reliable in many circumstances, such as rainy weather. Other reasons Burton gave for recognising lewisi as a separate species were geography, there is at least 108 kilometres separating the forms, which Burton then interpreted to mean that the populations were reproductively isolated, despite there being no reproductive barriers between the populations. Grant reported seeing caymanensis on Grand Cayman in 1940, but Burton states that this was likely a mistaken sighting made during rainy weather. Lastly Burton points to mitochondrial DNA analysis performed by Catherine Malone et al. in 2000; although the sample size was extremely small and there was some ambiguity, the different populations did have different haplotypes. Although Malone et al. found C. nubila sensu lato to be monophyletic, Burton claimed lewisi could be separated from the other two taxa without rendering C. nubila polyphyletic. Although none of this might be used to traditionally delineate a population as a species, he proposed using the \"general lineage concept\" introduced by de Queiroz in 1998 to do so anyway.\n\nCommon names\nThis animal was originally called the Grand Cayman rock iguana, or Grand Cayman blue rock iguana. After separating this population taxonomically from the other Cayman Islands rock iguanas, Burton proposed a set of new vernacular names for the population in 2004: Grand Cayman blue iguana, Cayman blue iguana or for local colloquial use he proposed the simple abbreviated blue iguana.\n\nNote that the name \"blue iguana\" is also used for bright blue forms of the green iguana, Iguana iguana.\n\nDescription\nThe blue iguana is the largest native land animal on Grand Cayman with a total nose-to-tail length of  and weighing as much as . This is among the largest species of lizard in the Western Hemisphere. The largest of the Cyclura, its body length is  with a tail equal in length. The blue iguana's toes are articulated to be efficient in digging and climbing trees. The mature male's skin color ranges from dark grey to turquoise blue, whereas the female is more olive green to pale blue. Young animals tend to be uniformly dark brown or green with faint darker banding. When they first emerge from the nest the neonates have an intricate pattern of eight dark dorsal chevrons from the crest of their necks to their pelvic area. These markings fade by the time the animal is one year old, changing to mottled gray and cream and eventually giving way to blue as adults. The adult blue iguana is typically dark gray matching the karst rock of its landscape. The animal changes its color to blue when it is in the presence of other iguanas to signal and establish territory. The blue color is more pronounced in males of the species. Their distinctive black feet stand in contrast to their lighter overall body color. The blue iguana's eyes have a golden iris and red sclera.\n\nBlue iguanas are sexually dimorphic; males are larger and have more prominent dorsal crests as well as larger femoral pores on their thighs, which are used to release pheromones. The male is larger than the female by one third of his body size.\n\nDistribution\nThe blue iguana is endemic to the island of Grand Cayman. As of 2012 the population can be found throughout the island Grand Cayman excluding the urban areas of Bodden Town, Gun Bay, Seven Mile Beach and West Bay. One theory for how the taxon ended up on the island is that a single female Cuban iguana, C. nubila nubila, with eggs inside her drifted across the sea, perhaps during a storm. Sometimes the Lesser Caymans iguana, C. nubila caymanensis, has been found on Grand Cayman.\n\nEcology\n\nHabitat\n \nThe blue iguana is found only on the island of Grand Cayman. Comparison with other Cyclura species in the region strongly suggests that there was once a coastal population of blue iguanas which was gradually displaced or extirpated by human settlements and the construction of roads. The blue iguana now only occurs inland in natural xerophytic shrubland and along the interfaces between farm clearings, roads, and gardens and closed-canopy dry forest or shrubland. The interior population is believed to have been attracted to agricultural clearings and fruit farms which provide thermoregulatory opportunities, herbaceous browse, fallen fruit, and nesting soil, but this brought the blue iguana into contact with humans and feral animals. Females often migrate to coastal areas to nest. Blue iguanas released into the Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park on Grand Cayman were radiotracked in 2004 to determine ranges for each animal. Females were found to occupy territories of  and males an average of  with overlap in common territories, indicating that they choose to maintain a population density of four to five animals per hectare.\n\nThe blue iguanas occupy rock holes and tree cavities, and as adults are primarily terrestrial. Although not known to be arboreal, it has been observed climbing trees  and higher. Younger individuals tend to be more arboreal.\n\nDiet\nLike all Cyclura species, the blue iguana is primarily herbivorous, consuming leaves, flowers, and fruits from over 45\u00a0species of plant. The diet is very rarely supplemented with insects, crabs, slugs and fungi.\n\nPredators\nHatchlings are preyed upon by the native snake Alsophis cantherigerus. The adults have no natural predators.\n\nLongevity\nLongevity in the wild is unknown but is presumed to be many decades. A blue iguana named \"Godzilla\" captured on Grand Cayman in 1950 by naturalist Ira Thompson was imported to the United States in 1985 by Ramon Noegel and sold to reptile importer and breeder, Tom Crutchfield in 1990. Crutchfield donated Godzilla to the Gladys Porter Zoo in Brownsville, Texas in 1997 and the lizard remained there until its death in 2004. Thompson estimated Godzilla to be 15\u00a0years of age at the time of his capture. At an estimated 69\u00a0years of age (54\u00a0of which were spent in captivity), Godzilla may be the world's longest-living lizard for which there is reliable record. A closely related Lesser Caymans iguana (C. nubila caymanensis) has been documented as living 33\u00a0years in captivity.\n\nReproduction\nMating occurs from May through June. Copulation is preceded by numerous head-bobs on the part of the male, who then circles around behind the female and grasps the nape of her neck. He then attempts to restrain the female in order to manoeuvre his tail under hers to position himself for intromission (copulation). Copulation generally lasts from 30\u00a0to 90\u00a0seconds, and a pair is rarely observed mating more than once or twice a day. A clutch of anywhere from 1\u00a0to 21\u00a0eggs are usually laid in June or July depending on the size and age of the female, in nests excavated in pockets of earth exposed to the sun. Several exploratory nests are begun before one is completed. These burrows can range from  to over  in length, with an enlarged chamber at its terminal portion to allow the female to turn around. The temperature within nests that have been monitored by researchers remained a constant  throughout the incubation period which ranges from 65 to 90\u00a0days. The blue iguana's eggs are among the largest laid by any lizard.\n\nIndividuals are aggressively territorial from the age of about three\u00a0months onward. They typically reach sexual maturity after four years of age in captivity.\n\nConservation\n\nEndangered status\n\nThe blue iguana is listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List. In 1988 the British researcher Roger Avery spent two weeks on the island and only observed three animals. Surveys in 2003 indicated a total population in the range of 5\u201315\u00a0individuals. In 2006 the iguana was one of the most endangered lizards on Earth.\n\nRestored free-roaming subpopulations in the Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park and the Salina Reserve numbered approximately 125\u00a0individuals in total after an initial release in December 2005. The restored subpopulation in the Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park has been breeding since 2001, and the subpopulation in the Salina Reserve was deemed to be breeding in 2006 after a nest of three hatched eggs was discovered in the wild. In April 2007, after another large-scale release, there were 299\u00a0blue iguanas living in the wild, with hundreds more being raised in captivity on Grand Cayman. In late 2012, the blue iguana recovery program estimated that the wild population had risen to approximately 750 individuals, and the IUCN subsequently downlisted the species from critically endangered to endangered.\n\nInternational trade in the species is regulated due to its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.\n\nCauses of decline\n\nHabitat destruction is the main factor threatening extinction for this iguana. Land clearance within remnant habitat is occurring for agriculture, road construction, and real estate development and speculation. The conversion of traditional crop lands to cattle pasture is eliminating secondary blue iguana habitat.\n\nPredation and injury to hatchlings by rats, to hatchlings and sub-adults by feral cats, and killing of adults by pet dogs are all placing severe pressure on the remaining wild population. Automobiles and motorscooters are an increasing cause of mortality as the iguanas rarely survive the collisions. Trapping and shooting is a comparatively minor concern, and has stopped according to the IUCN in 2012, but before 1995 occasional trapping may have occurred.\n\nThe common green iguana, (Iguana iguana), has been introduced from Honduras and is well-established on Grand Cayman as an invasive species. It far outnumbers the native blue iguana. No direct negative consequences on the blue iguana due to this introduction are known, but the mere presence of the green iguana confuses public attitudes and understanding. For example, the people of the island are told that blue iguanas are endangered and rare, but the green iguana looks very similar and are quite common in suburban areas.\n\nIn 2008 six blue iguanas were found dead in the preserve within Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park on Grand Cayman. The iguanas were apparently killed by human vandals armed with knives and two of the slaughtered animals were gravid females about to lay eggs.\n\nThe wild population of blue iguanas had been reduced from a near island-wide distribution to a non-viable, fragmented remnant. By 2001 no young hatched in the unmanaged wild population were surviving to breeding age, meaning the population was functionally extinct, with only five animals remaining in the wild.\n\nRecovery efforts\nIn 1990, the American Zoo and Aquarium Association designated the genus Cyclura as their highest priority for conservation. Their first project was an in situ captive breeding program for the blue iguana.\n\nOne of the early difficulties encountered was that the captive stock of the early 1990s was found not to be pure. It was discovered through DNA analysis that the captive population contained a number of animals that were hybrids with C. nubila caymanensis. These hybrids were sterilized by means of hemipenectomies so that the program contain only pure-breeds. This program was created to determine the exact genealogies of the limited gene pool of the remaining animals and DNA analysis revealed that the entire North American captive population was descended from a single pair of animals.\n\nAs a hedge against disaster striking the blue iguana population on Grand Cayman, in 2004 an ex situ captive population was established in 25\u00a0zoos in the USA. A minimum of 20\u00a0founder lines represented by at least 225\u00a0individuals is being maintained by captive breeding and recorded in a studbook for the species by Tandora Grant of the San Diego Zoo's Center for Conservation and Research for Endangered Species. By 2002 the Indianapolis Zoo had success with breeding the blue iguana in captivity twice since the year 2000.\n\nIn October 2006, hatchlings were released into the wild for the first time to boost the species and help bring them back from the brink of extinction. Each released blue iguana wears a string of colored beads through its nuchal crest for visual identification at a distance, backed up by an implanted microchip and a high-resolution photograph of its head scales. Head scale patterns are as unique among blue iguanas as fingerprints are among humans.\n\nThe blue iguana is established in captivity, both in public and private collections. There are very few pure-bred animals in private collections, animals in captive breeding programs are often hybrids with the Lesser Caymans Iguana\u00a0(C. nubila caymanensis) and occasional hybrids with the Cuban Iguana\u00a0(C. nubila nubila). Breeding in the pet trade minimizes the demand for wild-caught specimens.\n\nBlue Iguana Recovery Programme\n\nThe Blue Iguana Recovery Programme grew from a small project started in 1990 within the National Trust for the Cayman Islands. It is now a partnership, linking the Trust with the Cayman Islands Department of Environment, National Trust Cayman Islands, Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park, Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, International Reptile Conservation Foundation, IRCF, and the European Commission. This program operates under a special exemption from provisions in the Animals Law of the Cayman Islands, which normally would make it illegal for anyone to kill, capture, or keep iguanas. BIRP's conservation strategy involves generating large numbers of genetically diverse hatchlings, headstarting them for two years so that their chance of survival in the wild is high, and using these animals to rebuild a series of wild sub-populations in protected, managed natural areas. A rapid numerical increase from a maximum possible number of founding stock is sought to minimize loss of genetic diversity caused by a population bottleneck.\n\nRestored sub-populations are present in two non-contiguous areas \u2014the Salina Reserve and the Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park. Habitat protection is still vital, as the Salina Reserve has only  of dry shrubland, which is not enough to sustain the 1,000\u00a0blue iguanas that were planned to be restored to the wild. The 2001 plan called for additional sub-populations to be restored in one or more other areas. When the wild sub-populations have reached the carrying capacity of their respective protected areas, release of head-started animals will be phased out.\n\nThe overall captive population is likely to remain genetically fragmented in the long term. To maintain gene flow, individuals should be translocated between zoos.\n\nAccording to the 2001 plan, breeding of blue iguanas in the wild will require indefinite future management. To sustain this activity, a range of commercial activities was hoped to generate the required funding. An education and awareness effort in 2007 was meant to ensure local involvement and support.\n\nIn April 2019, one iguana laid 18 eggs for possible hatching. Any survivals will be the first successful breeding since 2015. In 2018, seven eggs were laid but none hatched.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Blue Iguana Recovery Program (B.I.R.P.)\n International Reptile Conservation Foundation\n The National Trust for the Cayman Islands, the B.I.R.P's parent organization\n International Iguana Foundation\n\nCyclura\nEndemic fauna of the Cayman Islands\nReptiles described in 1940\nTaxa named by Chapman Grant\nEndangered fauna of North America", "machine_text": "Blue iguana is a species of iguana that belongs to the genus Cyclura.

The blue iguana was once considered extinct in the wild due to habitat destruction and predation by introduced species. However, a conservation program began in 2002, and since then, the species has made a remarkable recovery - from just a handful of individuals in the wild, the population has grown to over 1000 individuals. Adult blue iguanas can reach a length of up to 5 feet (1.5 meters) and can weigh up to 30 pounds (14 kilograms). They have a distinctive blue-grey coloration that fades to a greenish-grey towards the tail. Some individuals have white or yellow markings on their head and body. Blue iguanas are herbivorous and feed mainly on leaves, fruits, and flowers. They are solitary animals and prefer to live alone, although they may gather in small groups during the breeding season. Females build nests in burrows or under rocks and lay up to 20 eggs at a time. Due to its unique appearance and significant conservation efforts, the blue iguana has become a symbol of the Cayman Islands and is often featured on tourism materials.

The film was a moderate commercial success domestically, making no. 3 on the British box office chart.\n\nPlot\nThe film is framed by Ray Santilli and his friend Gary Shoefield retelling the events to a documentary maker.\n\nIn 1995, Ray and Gary go to the USA to find Elvis memorabilia to sell on the market stall Ray runs in London. A former US Army cameraman, Harvey, sells them a silent black and white film of Elvis performing live, but later returns with an intriguing offer. Harvey takes Ray to Miami, Florida to see a film from 1947, showing the autopsy of an alien supposedly killed in a UFO crash in Roswell, New Mexico. Harvey wants to sell the film for $30,000.\n\nGary and Ray return to England to look for an investor to give them the money. Ray convinces Laszlo Voros, a Hungarian homosexual art and drug dealer obsessed with crop circles, to give him the $30,000 and retrieves the film from Harvey.

In order to avoid serious repercussions from Voros, they decide to make their own recreation of it. They base the content on Ray's memories of the original, and, with the help of some friends, fashion a convincing replica of the dead alien using a mannequin and meat products obtained from a friend's butcher's shop, turn the living room of Gary's sister into a film set, and shoot the film on a Bell and Howell spring-wound camera. Ray gives a copy of the final product to Voros, who believes it to be real.\n\nHaving convinced Voros, Ray and Gary decide to sell the film to other venues, earning them a large sum of money. However, when Voros hears about its international distribution, he demands 80% of the profits. A potential clash is averted when Voros is killed by a green Land Rover while standing naked in the middle of a crop circle, leading to speculation that he has been killed by a CIA agent.\n\nRay and Gary travel to Argentina to promote the film, followed by reporter Amber Fuentes, who seduces Ray.

The film stars Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly, also known as Ant and Dec, as Ray Santilli and Gary Shoefield, respectively. Other cast members include Bill Pullman, Harry Dean Stanton, and G\u00f6tz Otto. The film was shot on location in London, Prague, and Sheffield. Alien Autopsy was released on April 7, 2006, and received mixed reviews from critics. The film grossed $8.7 million at the box office. Despite not being a commercial success, Alien Autopsy has since gained a cult following, especially in the UK. The film's plot revolves around Ray and Gary, two struggling British filmmakers who stumble across footage of an alien autopsy while trying to sell old reels of film. They decide to release the footage as a documentary, claiming it to be authentic, in the hopes of making a fortune. As they gain fame and fortune, they continue to perpetuate the hoax despite mounting evidence to the contrary. The film is presented as a mockumentary, blending real interviews with fictional reenactments of events. Alien Autopsy is a satirical look at the media's obsession with conspiracy theories and the lengths people will go to make a quick buck. The film's humor is often irreverent, poking fun at both the hoaxers and the believers. Despite its flaws, Alien Autopsy is an entertaining and enjoyable comedy that offers a fresh perspective on one of the most enduring mysteries of the modern era.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 4109723}

It is one of two high schools in the Decatur City School District.  Decatur High offers technical, academic, and Advanced Placement (AP) programs, as well as dual enrollment with the John C. Calhoun Community College System.\n\nDecatur High, along with southwestern Decatur's Austin High School, were the first International Baccalaureate schools in Alabama north of Birmingham.  Starting in the 2017-2018 school year, Decatur High will no longer continue the IB program.\n\nIn 2018, the Decatur City Schools, in a massive realignment of school districting, opened a new DHS campus across Somerville Road Southeast from its location of several decades on Prospect Drive. The new Decatur High was built on the site of the former Somerville Road Elementary School, whose students were eventually moved to the old Oak Park Middle School (subsequently renamed Oak Park Elementary). Students who formerly attended Oak Park Middle were moved into the old DHS campus, which was renovated and renamed Decatur Middle. A similar process occurred with schools on Decatur's western side at the same time.\n\nAthletics\n\nDecatur High's football and soccer programs play at the 9,000-seat Ogle Stadium at the southern end of the former Decatur High campus, also located near Decatur Morgan Hospital. The stadium, owned by the school system, is named for Alabama Sports Hall of Famer and former Decatur High coach H. L. \"Shorty\" Ogle, who led the Red Raiders from 1933 to 1963. The high school's sports teams often use the field for practice.\n\nPrior to 1949, the Decatur football team played at the 3,000-person capacity Benson Field, now a part of Rhodes Ferry Park along the shores of the Tennessee River, located next to the now-closed Riverview High School, Decatur High's predecessor.\n\nPrior to 2018, when Austin High School relocated and got a stadium of its own (at the same time of Decatur High's physical relocation across Somerville Road), both of the high schools in Decatur played their home games in the stadium, with their schedules arranged accordingly; occasionally, that meant that one of the teams had to play a home game on a Thursday night, instead of Friday as is customary in Alabama high school athletics.  The one exception was the Decatur-Austin game.  In that case, one team occupied the away side while the other manned the home side.  The schools alternated hosting each year, despite the game occurring on Decatur High property, akin to the practice of Alabama and Auburn college football in the years when the \"Iron Bowl\" was held at Legion Field in Birmingham. This football game usually sold out the stadium, and brought in crowds of over 10,000, in a city of perhaps 40,000 to 50,000 population, to watch the intra-city rivalry.\n\nFootball\nDecatur High has produced many players that went on to play at the collegiate and professional levels, including Jerraud Powers and Rolando McClain.\n\nOther long-tenured Red Raider coaches, other than Ogle, are Earl Webb and Steve Rivers, father of famed NFL quarterback Philip Rivers. However, the younger Rivers played his high school ball at Athens High School in nearby Athens, Alabama, where his father was coaching at the time. As of 2021, Jere Adcock, Steve Rivers' successor, is the current head coach at DHS.\n\nThe Decatur High School Football Team won the 1971 State 4A Football Championship under the leadership of Coach Earl Webb and coaches Wally Burnham, Paul Glover and Jimmy Holley. (Alabama High School Football Historical Society)\n\nBasketball\n\nDecatur High School has won one boys' state championship under coach Earl Morris and five girls' state championships under coach Mike Smith. The 1948 basketball team was the first Decatur High team to go to the state tournament; however, it did not win the county tournament.\n\nSoccer\nThe Decatur High School girls' soccer team defeated Briarwood Christian of Birmingham in the class 5A Alabama State Championship game on May 10, 2008.\n\nVisual arts\n\nDecatur High School's Visual Arts department offers a wide range of art courses that include Drawing and Painting (Art I \u2013 IB/AP Studio Art), Ceramics, Graphic Design, and Photography. A scaffolded curriculum is in place to prepare students for portfolio coursework in IB (International Baccalaureate) Visual Art or AP Studio Art classes. In addition to ongoing competition exhibitions, student work is exhibited throughout the year at Decatur Morgan Hospital, in the fall at the All City Music and Art Festival, and at Decatur High during its spring art exhibit. \nStudents in the IB and AP Art courses have scored above the world average for the past two years.\n\nStudents who excel in the visual arts at Decatur High School and who exhibit exemplary character and meet academic requirements are invited to join the National Art Honor Society (NAHS). NAHS was created by the National Art Education Association for the purpose of inspiring and recognizing those students who have shown an outstanding ability in art. NAHS members at Decatur High School complete art-related service hours for the Carnegie Visual Arts Center and to create ceramic bowls to raise money for North Alabama food pantries.\nDecatur High School students participate annually in various city, state, and national competitions. In 2011\u221212 students placed 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place in the citywide PTA Reflections competition. A DHS senior was awarded a regional Gold Key in the prestigious Scholastic Art and Writing Award competition, a regional Blue Ribbon in the district 5 VAA competition, and also earned one of three portfolio scholarships in the Alabama State Council on the Arts Visual Arts Achievement Program that are annually adjudicated by college professionals from the Southeast according to AP College Board guidelines.\n\nThe Decatur High School art department actively promotes the success of its students through participation in state and nationally-recognized competitions and assists students in applications for portfolio and academic merit scholarships. During the 2011\u201312 school year, students received over $140,000 in visual art scholarships.\n\nBand\nThe Decatur High School's Chorus and Concert Bands have consistently received superior ratings in both district and state festivals.\n\nDecatur High has the longest string of District Festival Superior Ratings in Alabama, dating back to the festival's formation in 1947, never receiving anything less than a superior rating.\n\nDecatur High also continues to lead in total number of Alabama Bandmasters State Festival Superior Ratings at 58, more than any other high school in state history.\n\nThe Decatur Red Raider Marching Band won the Tennessee Valley Invitational at Muscle Shoals High School in Muscle Shoals, Alabama in 2006. Since then, the band has won its class twice at the Vanderbilt Marching Invitational. During its undefeated 2010 season, the Red Raider Marching Band became the first ever band from the state of Alabama to win a class at the prestigious Contest of Champions in Murfreesboro, Tennessee.

He eventually became interested in the study of public health and epidemiology, and began conducting research on various diseases, including cholera and typhus. In 1847, Guy was appointed as the first medical officer of health for the city of London. In this role, he was responsible for collecting and analyzing data on public health and disease outbreaks, as well as implementing measures to prevent the spread of disease. He was a strong advocate for improving sanitation and hygiene, and his efforts led to significant improvements in the health of Londoners. Guy also played a key role in the development of the field of epidemiology. He wrote several influential works on the subject, including \"Lectures on the Theory and Practice of Medical Police\" and \"Principles of Forensic Medicine\". These works helped to establish epidemiology as a distinct field of study, and laid the groundwork for future advances in public health. In addition to his work as a physician and epidemiologist, Guy was also a prominent social reformer. He was a member of the Society of Friends, and was actively involved in many campaigns for social justice, including the abolition of slavery and the improvement of working conditions for laborers.

In what is well known today by the phrase \"one if by land, two if by sea\", one lantern in the steeple would signal the army's choice of the land route while two lanterns would signal the route \"by water\" across the Charles River (the movements would ultimately take the water route, and therefore two lanterns were placed in the steeple). Pulling was a logical choice to help signal. He was heavily involved with the church, and was a vestryman. If caught with the lanterns, he could provide a meaningful excuse for being in the church.\n\nOn the evening of April 18, Pulling hung two lanterns from the steeple of the church for just under a minute, just long enough for the militia in Charlestown to see but not long enough to catch the attention of the British troops occupying Boston.\n\nReferences\n\nPeople of Massachusetts in the American Revolution\nPatriots in the American Revolution\nPeople from colonial Boston\n18th-century American military personnel", "machine_text": "John Pulling (1767 \u2013 1836) was a British naval officer who served during the late 18th and early 19th centuries.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Jackson Beardy\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Jackson Beardy (July 24, 1944 \u2013 December 7, 1984) was an Indigenous Anishinaabe artist born in Canada. His works are characterized by scenes from Ojibwe and Cree oral traditions and many focus on the relationship between humans and nature. He belonged to the Woodland School of Art and was a prominent member of the Indian Group of Seven. His work has contributed to the recognition of Indigenous contemporary art within Canada.\n\nEarly life and education \nJackson Beardy was born July 24, 1944. He was the son of John Beardy and Dinah Monias and fifth of 13 children. Beardy's father supported the family as a trapper, hunter, pedlar, gold miner, fisherman and fish filleter. The Beardys lived in a single-roomed log cabin but despite the lack of material goods, John Beardy provided the necessities and Beardy appears to have had a happy childhood. He lived with his grandmother, from whom he learned the oral traditions and legends of his Anishinaabe ancestors, for most of his childhood.\n\nBeardy attended residential school at Portage la Prairie in Southern Manitoba at the age of seven. Here, he was separated from his sister and could not communicate with her during the school years. Before attending the school, he did not speak English. Beardy quickly distanced himself from the forced nature of education that all Indigenous peoples in that area underwent at the residential schools, and it was from these lessons that he began to assert his Indigenous culture. Beardy's reaction to the mental de-structuring process at the school was to become the school wit.  It was at the residential school that he learned how to draw and paint. A kind school teacher, Mary Morris, encouraged Beardy's art and stayed in touch with Beardy after he left the school. When drawing at the school, he was not permitted to visually express the Anishinaabe oral narratives.\n\nAt the age of 16, the authorities allowed the students to leave the school, however the principal of the residential school promised Beardy an art education if he stayed two more years to gain his high school certificate. Beardy then chose to stay another two years. At the age of 18, Beardy approached the principal to ask for the promised art education, but quickly learned that the principal would not allow him the art education after all. The principal did not believe that being an artist would make Beardy a \"decent\" citizen. Instead, he offered Beardy a course in commercial art, since this would be more economically sustainable. When learning this, young Beardy angrily told him, that he would show him that he is capable of becoming an artist.\n\nDuring his last year in high school, his grades began to fall and Beardy turned to alcoholism. After failing high school, Beardy still wished to pursue an art education; he completed the failed courses and was accepted into a course on commercial art. He completed these courses at Technical Vocational High School and graduated in 1964. Subsequently, Beardy completed his education at the School of Art at the University of Manitoba in 1966.\n\nArt career\nJackson Beardy's first solo exhibition was in 1965 at the University of Winnipeg. He had many subsequent solo exhibitions throughout 1960s and 1970s. In 1967, Beardy was commissioned to create pieces to commemorate the Canadian centennial. That same year he was invited to serve as consultant for the \"Canadian Indian Pavilion\" at Expo 67.\n\nIn 1972 Jackson Beardy, Alex Janvier, and Daphne Odjig held a joint exhibition at the Winnipeg Art Gallery titled \"Treaty Numbers 23, 287, 1171\". The name of the piece was a reference to the numbered treaties that were negotiated with the Canadian government of each artist's band. From this 1973 exhibition, a group of Indigenous artists formed the \"Professional Native Indian Artists Association\", better known as the \"Indian Group of Seven\". Included alongside Jackson Beardy was Alex Janvier, Norval Morrisseau, Daphne Odjig, Carl Ray, Eddy Cobiness and Joseph Sanchez. They collaborated to move their work toward larger mainstream acceptance. They committed to maintaining Indigenous control over Indigenous works of art and emphasized artistic rather than anthropological value.\n\nFrom 1974 through 1976, Beardy contributed artwork to the covers of numerous books including Ojibway Heritage by Basil Johnston, When the Morning Stars Sang Together by John Morgan, and Almighty Voice by Leonard Peterson. Also in 1976, Beardy was one of the contributing artists for a Royal Ontario Museum exhibit called, \"Contemporary Native Art of Canada: The Woodland Indians\" which travelled to Germany and England.\n\nIn 1977, Beardy had an exhibition in Vancouver, BC entitled, \"Images for a Canadian Heritage\".\n\nFrom 1982 through 1983, Jackson Beardy was senior arts advisor for the Federal Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, now known as Indian and Northern Affairs Canada. He developed the \"Indian Fine Arts Guide\" which outlined procedures for the acquisition of Indigenous art. Additionally during this time, he held the position of art advisor and cultural consultant for the Manitoba Museum of Man and Nature.\n\nIn 1984, Beardy was commissioned to paint a mural at the intersection of Selkirk and Powers in Winnipeg. The paintings were to depict \"Peace and Harmony\" but Beardy died before he could complete it. It was completed posthumously by students from R.B. Russell Vocational High School. The piece was revealed on September 5, 1985.\n\nIn celebration of his body of work, Beardy's art was shown at the Winnipeg Art Gallery from 1993 to 1994. It was again shown in 1995, in an exhibit called \"Jackson Beardy: A Life's Work\" at the Thunder Bay Art Gallery. Beardy's artwork has been displayed in many museums and other notable institutions both domestically and internationally.\n\nArt style\nBeardy, as well as other members from the Professional Native Indian Artists Incorporated, was a member of the Woodlands School of Indigenous Art. This Woodlands style of artistic expression can be seen in the central role Beardy's Anishinaabe heritage plays within his work. Using a variety of supports, such as canvas, birch bark, and beaver skins, Beardy's artwork often showcases traditional figures from Ojibwe and Cree oral traditions. His art draws on a deep knowledge of his native Cree tradition gained from a close childhood relationship with his grandmother and from his systematic collection of myths and legends in northern Manitoba.\n\nHis distinctive graphic style contrasts precise, black outlines with defined areas of rich colour. His art expresses fundamental cosmological and spiritual concepts such as balance in nature, regeneration and growth, and the interdependence of humans and nature.\n\nDeath\nJackson Beardy died on December 7, 1984 in Winnipeg, Manitoba from complications after a heart attack.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n Hughes, Kenneth.

His art was often inspired by traditional Indigenous stories and legends, as well as by the natural world and its forces. Beardy was born in Garden Hill, Manitoba, of the Oji-Cree people. He grew up near the lake at Garden Hill, and would return to this theme frequently in his art. His art education began in 1963 at the Fine Arts Department of the Provincial Institute of Technology and Art (now the Alberta College of Art and Design) in Calgary, Alberta. However, he found the approach too focused on Western principles and left after two years. Beardy then turned to study with Carl Ray and Norval Morrisseau, two leading Indigenous artists who were revitalizing indigenous art traditions, specifically the form now called the Woodland School. He also was influenced by attending a workshop led by the internationally renowned artist Daphne Odjig in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The Woodland School artists, like Ray, Morrisseau, Odjig, and Blake Debassige, focused on Indigenous legends and spiritual experiences that inspired their work. Beardy was also an important advocate for Indigenous arts. He was one of the founders of the Professional Native Indian Artists Association (PNIA) in 1973. Beardy saw PNIA as an opportunity to establish Indigenous art as contemporary art and to reject the colonial stereotypes of Indigenous art as a \"primitive\" or \"craft-based\" tradition. The PNIA exhibition \"Tribal Images,\" held in Toronto in 1973, was a groundbreaking moment, and Beardy contributed several works to the show. Sadly, Jackson Beardy died in a car accident in 1984 at the age of 40. His work, however, still resonates powerfully within the contemporary Indigenous art movements of Canada. His artistic vision and his advocacy for Indigenous art helped to change the way that this art is understood and valued.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 17607221}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Shot hole disease\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Shot hole disease (also called Coryneum blight) is a serious fungal disease that creates BB-sized holes in leaves, rough areas on fruit, and concentric lesions on branches. The pathogen that causes shot hole disease is Wilsonomyces carpophilus.\n\nHosts and symptoms\n\nThe fungal pathogen Wilsonomyces carpophilus affects members of the Prunus genera. Almond, apricot, nectarine, peach, prune and cherry trees can be affected. Both edible and ornamental varieties are vulnerable to infection. Almost all over-ground parts of the plants are affected including the fruits, buds and the stems, but the damage is most noticeable on the leaves. The symptoms begin with small (1/10-1/4\u201d) reddish or purplish-brown spots with light green or yellow ring around them. As the disease progresses the damaged areas become slightly larger and then dry up and fall away, leaving BB-sized holes behind. As the fungus spreads, more leaf tissue is damaged until the leaf falls. Significant infections can reduce the amount of photosynthesis that can occur, weakening the plant, and decreasing fruit production. The infection on the fruits in turn begins as small purple spots that develop into gray to white lesions. Gummosis may occur (both on the fruits and the stems as well). These lesions leave toughened spots on the skin, and in some cases the fruit may be lost. Infected buds may appear darker than normal. Branches may develop concentric lesions when infected. These lesions may girdle a twig and kill it.\n\nDisease cycle\nW. carpophilus overwinters in infected buds and in twig cankers. Asexual spores (conidia) are dispersed in spring when moisture levels increase or as a result of overhead watering. Spores are pigmented and remain viable, in a dormant state, for months. Infection can occur any time moisture is present for at least 24 hours, as long as temperatures are above . At higher temperatures, infection occurs more quickly. W. carpophilus infection takes only 6 hours at .\n\nManagement\nW. carpophilus can remain viable for several months and spores are often airborne. Since the fungi thrive in wet conditions, overhead watering should be avoided. Remove and dispose of any infected buds, leaves, fruit and twigs. In fall, fixed copper or Bordeaux mixture can be applied.\n\nImportance\nShot hole disease is a major concern of the stone fruit industry. It is estimated that 80% of the California almond crop may be infested with shot hole disease, resulting in a potential yield loss of 50-75%. In the 1930s, it was found that applications of Bordeaux mixture reduces shot hole disease on peaches from 80% to 9%.\n\nReferences\n\nFungal tree pathogens and diseases\nStone fruit tree diseases", "machine_text": "Shot hole disease is a plant disease caused by a variety of fungal pathogens. It primarily affects stone fruit trees such as peach, nectarine, apricot, and plum trees, but can also impact ornamental plants such as dogwood, photinia, and cherry laurel. The disease is characterized by small, circular holes that form on the leaves as the infected tissues fall out. The disease causes defoliation and can lead to reduced fruit production and dieback of branches. The symptoms of shot hole disease typically begin in the spring and early summer months when the fungal pathogen infects the newly emerging leaves. The disease is most severe in wet weather conditions when the spores of the fungus are able to easily spread from tree to tree. It is also common in areas with high humidity, especially during the growing season. Fungicides are the most common treatment for shot hole disease, but early detection and proper cultural practices can also help prevent or reduce infection. Pruning out infected branches can also help reduce the spread of the disease. However, certain fungicides may be harmful to bees and beneficial insects, so it is important to carefully follow label instructions when applying these products. Preventative measures include proper sanitation around the affected trees, practicing good hygiene during pruning, and maintaining proper nutrition and hydration levels for the trees. This helps encourage strong, healthy growth which can make them more resistant to the pathogen. Overall, shot hole disease can be a serious problem for trees and should be addressed promptly to prevent further spread and damage. With appropriate treatment and preventative measures, it is possible to maintain healthy and productive trees for years to come.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 50346824}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"New Jersey Route 183\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Route 183 is a  long state highway in the northern regions of New Jersey. The southern end of the route is at an interchange with Interstate 80 and U.S. Route 206 (US\u00a0206) near Netcong, while the northern end is at an interchange with US 206 in Stanhope. The route heads northward through downtown Netcong and along the shores of Lake Musconetcong and enters Sussex County, New Jersey. The route is a former alignment of US 206 bypassed in 1973.\n\nThe highway dates back to the designations of State Highway Route 31, which was main north\u2013south highway in New Jersey. The Netcong Circle, a traffic circle in Netcong between Route\u00a0183 and U.S. Route 46 was present for the entire lifetime of Route\u00a0183 until it was replaced by a signalized intersection in 2013. A nearby bridge over a New Jersey Transit line was also replaced.\n\nRoute description \n\nRoute 183 begins at a partial cloverleaf interchange with U.S. Route 206 and Interstate 80 in the community of Roxbury, New Jersey. The route heads northward, intersecting with local dead-end streets deep in the forests of rural Morris County. Route 183 passes a nearby factory and intersects U.S. Route 46. The route continues northward, crossing over a creek and entering downtown Netcong. Downtown Netcong is highly developed, and Route 183 serves as the main street through the community. The highway intersects with Allen Street (Morris County Route 631) before running along the shores of Lake Musconetcong and into Sussex County.\n\nUpon entering Sussex County, Route 183 enters the community of Stanhope. At the intersection with Musconetcong Avenue, the highway turns to the northwest, leaving the shores of the lake. Route 183 continues through the residential developments in Stanhope, working its way into the mountains above the lake. The roadway passes west of a park and ride lot located at an American Legion hall. At the intersection with Dell Road, Route 183 becomes intertwined with the interchange on U.S. Route 206 northbound, and the highways merge a short distance later in Stanhope.\n\nHistory \nThe original designation in the area of Netcong along Route\u00a0183's alignment is State Highway Route 31, which consisted much of the alignment of current-day U.S. Route 206. The route was first assigned in the 1927 state highway renumbering as a co-designation to US 206. This alignment remained in place for about two and half decades, when in the 1953 state highway renumbering, the State Highway Route 31 designation was dropped in favor of using U.S. Route 206. The route in Netcong stayed the same for several years after the decommissioning until the Regional Plan Association proposed a freeway realignment of US 206 in 1962.  The highway was to serve local recreation areas and relieve traffic on Interstate 287 to the east. The route was advocated through 1972, and after the fiscal year budgets went sour, the proposal was dropped.\n\nIn 2007, the New Jersey Department of Transportation proposed the elimination of the Netcong Traffic Circle, located at the intersections of U.S. Route 46 and Route 183 just north of the interchange with Interstate 80. The project was to produce two outcomes: replacement of the New Jersey Transit bridge that Route 183 crosses, and the elimination of the Netcong Circle with a signalized intersection. The project had issues dealing with the vertical clearance of the overpass for U.S. Route 46 westbound. The removal of the circle would eliminate this bridge, and the land would go to use as the new signalized intersection, with pedestrian and bicycle fittings. The entire project cost about $13.3 million (2009 USD) of state and local funds to construct. The Netcong Circle was replaced with a temporary junction in January 2013; the permanent intersection configuration opened in August of that year. The new bridge over the New Jersey Transit line opened in March 2013.\n\nThe circle itself dated back to construction in 1938. The circle itself could not handle the 17,000 vehicles a year that use the large roadway daily, and was the site of several accidents, including 45 in 2007 alone. The entire traffic circle conversion will eliminate two businesses in the area and is still slated for construction.\n\nMajor intersections\n\nSee also\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\nNew Jersey Roads: Route 183\nRoute 183 Photos\nNew Jersey Highway Ends - 183\n\n183\nTransportation in Morris County, New Jersey\nTransportation in Sussex County, New Jersey", "machine_text": "New Jersey Route 183, commonly referred to as NJ-183, is a state highway in New Jersey, United States.

Listed at , 168\u00a0lb., Harris batted left-handed and threw right-handed.\n\nNicknamed \"Vicious Vic\", he was noted as one of the toughest players of his era in black baseball; Harris managed the Grays to first place in the Negro National League eight times (most for any manager in the Negro leagues) along with a Negro World Series title while being named to the East-West All Star Game seven times.\n\nCareer\nA native of Pensacola, Florida, Harris was the brother of fellow Negro leaguer Neal Harris. He moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1914 and played baseball at the local YMCA. Harris started his professional career shortly after his 18th birthday, playing two games for the Pittsburgh Keystones in 1922 before moving to the Cleveland Tate Stars in 1923 and the Cleveland Browns in 1924, before start a long association with the Homestead Grays in 1925 which lasted 23 years. At this time, Homestead were not a member of any established league as the team rarely played other top black squads in those years and so statistics are limited, but when the Grays did, they often showed themselves to be a superior team.\n\nWhen Homestead joined the Eastern Colored League in 1928, Harris hit an anemic .204 average before the league folded, but he improved significantly in 1929, batting .350 in the high-offense American Negro League. In 1933 he hit .321 with Homestead, and .384 for the 1934 Pittsburgh Crawfords. The 1935 season brought Harris back to Homestead. He hit .342, as his eight home runs tied for fifth in the league and were even with Hall of Fame slugger Turkey Stearnes. A year later, he hit .315. In 1938, when Homestead dominated the league and won the first half with an .813 winning percentage, Harris led his team with a .380 batting average.\n\nHarris managed the Grays during their years in league play, between 1935 and 1948, and piloted Homestead to eight pennants. He guided his team to six consecutive first-place finishes from 1937 through 1942 (with five pennants). He took a job with a defense plant after the 1942 season, for which he would play for the Grays when he could do so while Candy Jim Taylor stepped in to manage the team for the next two seasons (each resulted in Negro World Series championships); Harris went 4-for-28 in the 1943 Negro World Series while not playing in the latter.\n\nHe also played in six East-West All-Star games between 1933 and 1947, and managed the East team eight times, four more than Oscar Charleston, the next-most-frequent manager. He won the last held Negro World Series in 1948 as the Grays left the league not long after.\n\nIn the waning days of the Negro leagues, Harris coached for the 1949 Baltimore Elite Giants and managed the 1950 Birmingham Black Barons. Additionally, he played winter baseball in the Cuban League and managed Santurce in the Puerto Rican League from 1947 to 1950.\n\nAvailable statistics indicate that Harris hit .305 (733-for-2,406), and his teams posted a 547\u2013278\u20132 mark in organized league play (with undoubtedly a higher total if one takes independent play into account) and a 10\u201315 mark during post-season play. An excellent motivator, he was well liked and respected by his players.\n\nPost-career and death\nAfter post-integration, he served as coach of the 1949 Baltimore Elite Giants, he took one last managerial job with the Birmingham Black Barons in 1950 before he retired. He became the head custodian for the Castaic Union Schools in Castaic, California. He died at the age of 72 in San Fernando, California from the after-effects of surgery for treatment of cancer. He was survived by his wife Dorothy and two children in Judith and Ronald.\n\nLegacy\nHarris has the most league pennants of any manager in Negro league baseball with seven. Just five other managers in baseball history have won seven pennants. Despite this, he has not been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. He was considered in the 2006 Hall of Fame balloting, but he was not selected. On November 5, 2021, he was selected to the final ballot for the Baseball Hall of Fame's Early Days Committee for consideration in the Class of 2022.

He won the European Cup with Celtic in 1967 along with several domestic honours. His other clubs included Stenhousemuir, Raith Rovers, Heart of Midlothian and Dumbarton in the Scottish leagues, and Crystal Palace in English football.\n\nWallace played for Scotland seven times and was inducted into the national Hall of Fame in 2017 for his club achievements.\n\nClub career\n\nEarly career\nHe started his senior playing career with Stenhousemuir as a teenager in 1958 (having played alongside Jim Storrie at Kilsyth Rangers), moving to Raith Rovers a year later. It was in Kirkcaldy that \"Wispy\", as Wallace was nicknamed, developed his reputation as a top-class goal poacher, his skills being rewarded with a first Scottish League cap.\n\nHearts\nWallace's form attracted attention from larger clubs, Heart of Midlothian eventually spending \u00a315,000 to take him to Edinburgh in April 1961. The increased pressure for success at Tynecastle initially curtailed his scoring exploits, for he was expected to replace no less a figure than Alex Young, the \"Golden Vision\", whom Hearts had sold to Everton a couple of months earlier. By season 1962\u201363, however, Wallace was fully settled into the tactics of manager Tommy Walker, and he would become Hearts' top scorer for the next four seasons through to 1965\u201366. In doing so, he helped Hearts win the Scottish League Cup in 1962 and come within a goal of winning the 1964\u201365 Scottish Football League title, while gaining full international recognition for Scotland.\n\nIn 1966, however, his form plummeted and his goalscoring ceased and, amid rumours that he had been \"tapped\" up by another club, his departure from Tynecastle was widely anticipated. The surprise was that his destination wasn't boyhood favourites Rangers but their nemesis Celtic, for whom Jock Stein paid \u00a330,000 to secure his services. He played a total of 248 matches for Hearts in all competitions, scoring 131 goals.\n\nCeltic\nWithin six months of joining Celtic, Wallace was to attain Scottish footballing immortality, as one of the \"Lisbon Lions\", the famous team who won the European Cup in 1967. He was later part of the team that reached the 1970 European Cup Final but was defeated 2\u20131 by Feyenoord. He also won the league championship in each of the four seasons he was at the Glasgow club, plus the Scottish Cup in 1967, 1969 and 1971 and the League Cup in 1968 and 1968 during an era widely considered the greatest in the club's history. In total, he scored 140 goals for Celtic in 239 games.\n\nLater career\nAfter five fruitful years with Celtic, Wallace and team-mate John Hughes were sold to Crystal Palace in October 1971 for a combined fee of \u00a330,000. Neither enjoyed great success in Croydon and Wallace was back in Scotland with Dumbarton less than a year later. As his career wound down, he moved to Australia in March 1975 to play for APIA, where he won two league titles before returning to Scotland in March 1977, first to Partick Thistle for a week, before becoming player-coach at Ross County for the rest of the 1976\u201377 season.\n\nInternational career\nIn total, Wallace was capped seven times for Scotland and four times for the Scottish Football League XI. He was part of the Scotland team that defeated England at Wembley in 1967.\n\nCareer after retirement\nRetiring as a player in June 1977, he joined the coaching staff at Dundee. When this role ended he returned to APIA as a coach, eventually settling in Sydney and starting his own sports shop.\n\nIn 2008, Tommy Burns, a former Celtic player and manager, died; Wallace helped organise a tribute match played on 31 May 2009 at Celtic Park, attended by over 35,000 people. The Celtic squad of the time defeated the 'Tommy Burns Select' team 11\u20134. In July of the same year, Wallace arranged a friendly match in Australia (where he had lived for the past 30 years) between Celtic and the local professional club Brisbane Roar; Celtic won 3\u20130.\n\nCareer statistics\n\nInternational appearances\n\nSee also\nList of footballers in Scotland by number of league appearances (500+)\nList of footballers in Scotland by number of league goals (200+)\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n \n\n1940 births\nAPIA Leichhardt FC players\nAssociation football inside forwards\nCeltic F.C. players\nCrystal Palace F.C. players\nDumbarton F.C. players\nDundee F.C. non-playing staff\nExpatriate soccer players in Australia\nHeart of Midlothian F.C. players\nKilsyth Rangers F.C. players\nLiving people\nPartick Thistle F.C. players\nRaith Rovers F.C. players\nRoss County F.C. players\nScotland international footballers\nScottish expatriate footballers\nScottish Football League players\nScottish Football League representative players\nScottish footballers\nSportspeople from Kirkintilloch\nStenhousemuir F.C. players\nEnglish Football League players\nScottish Football Hall of Fame inductees\nUEFA Champions League winning players\nScottish expatriate sportspeople in Australia\nHighland Football League players\nScottish Junior Football Association players\nOutfield association footballers who played in goal\nScottish emigrants to Australia", "machine_text": "Willie Wallace was a Scottish professional footballer who played as a striker between 1961 and 1976.

These markers, comprising a pair of earthen mounds, denoted the distance in ri () to Nihonbashi, the \"Bridge of Japan\", erected in Edo in 1603.They were typically planted with an enoki or Japanese red pine to provide shelter for travelers. Since the Meiji period, most of the ichirizuka have disappeared, having been destroyed by the elements, modern highway construction and urban encroachment. In 1876, the \"Ichirizuka Abolition decree\" was issued by the Meiji government and many were demolished at that time. Currently, 17 surviving ichirizuka are designated as national historic sites.\n\nIn the case of the \u014chira ichirizuka, the mounds flank the T\u014dkaid\u014d which connected Edo with Kyoto, between the post stations of Okazaki-juku and Fujikawa-juku. The surrounding lands around this marker were tenry\u014d territory, administered from the nearby Ohira daikansho, and the local magistrate, Honda Narishige, supervised the construction. The northern mound was destroyed in 1928 due to road construction work, and only the southern mound was preserved. The mound is approximately 2.4 meters in height and 7.6 to 8.5 meters in diameter. An Enoki tree was planted by the mound at the time of its construction, but this tree was destroyed by a typhoon in 1958, and the tree presently on the mound is its replacement.\n\nSee also\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Aichi)\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nOkazaki city official site\nOkazaki tourism home page \n\nIchirizuka\nOkazaki, Aichi\nHistoric Sites of Japan\nHistory of Aichi Prefecture\nMikawa Province", "machine_text": "\u014chira Ichirizuka was a Japanese scholar, historian, and professor of Japanese history at Kyoto University.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Charlottesville and Albemarle Railway\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Charlottesville and Albemarle Railway (C&A) was a short electric street railroad operating within the city of Charlottesville, Virginia, United States, during the early 20th century.  The line was preceded by several streetcar lines operating both horse-drawn and electric powered cars dating back to 1887.  After facing financial difficulties, the predecessor lines were reorganized into the C&A in 1903.  The C&A's electric streetcars operated off of an overhead line system that was powered by the railroad's own power plant.  The C&A also offered electric power generated by its plant to the city of Charlottesville.  During the mid-1910s, the line received numerous upgrades, including the construction of a new power plant on the Rivanna River, a new company headquarters building, expansion of track, and the purchase of new streetcars.\n\nIncreased expenses and decreasing ridership, coupled with the Great Depression, caused the railway to cease streetcar operations in 1935.  The railway was reorganized as the Charlottesville and Albemarle Bus Company in 1936 with a transition to bus service.  Today, Charlottesville Area Transit provides bus service to the city of Charlottesville; however, the city has recently investigated the feasibility of a streetcar line following much of the same route as the Charlottesville and Albemarle Railway.\n\nHistory\n\nBackground\nCharlottesville gained its first railroad in 1850, when the Virginia Central Railroadformerly the Louisa Railroadarrived as it progressed westward towards the Blue Ridge Mountains.  The Orange and Alexandria Railroad, chartered in 1848, entered into a contract in the early 1850s with the Virginia Central to use the Virginia Central's track from Gordonsville to Charlottesville for its extension southward towards Lynchburg.  This line began operations to Charlottesville in April 1854.  Thus, two major railroadsthe Virginia Central in an east-west direction and the Orange and Alexandria in a north-south directionconverged at Charlottesville, ensuring the town's prosperity.  In 1868, the Virginia Central was reorganized with the Covington and Ohio Railroad to form the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad, which was renamed as the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O) in 1878.  After a series of mergers, the Orange and Alexandria Railroad was incorporated into the newly formed Southern Railway in 1894.  Charlottesville became a significant junction of the two railroads, with two railroad stations in operation.  One was on the C&O line and the second, the Union Station, was just west of the C&O station at the junction between the C&O and Southern railroads.\n\nThe first local transit system within Charlottesville was established in 1883 as an omnibus line operating on a regular schedule.  This service, which consisted of a large mule- or horse-drawn cart, operated between downtown Charlottesville and the University of Virginia.  Fare for the one-way trip cost 10\u00a2 ($ today).  This service would soon be replaced by the development of Charlottesville's streetcar system.\n\nDevelopment of the streetcar system\nThe C&A's earliest predecessor line was chartered by the Virginia General Assembly on March 30, 1887 as the Charlottesville and University Street Railway Company.  This line constructed the first horse-drawn streetcar line within Charlottesville and began operation on June 14, 1887.  The Piedmont Construction and Improvement Company (renamed as Piedmont Traction Company in January 1896) was incorporated by the General Assembly on March 4, 1890 and began work on an electrified streetcar line.  Meanwhile, the Charlottesville and University Street Railway Companyrenamed as the Charlottesville City and Suburban Railway in 1895continued operation.  For a time these two companies operated both horse-drawn and electric streetcars on parallel tracks simultaneously, beginning with the first operation of the electric streetcars on January 12, 1895.\n\nThis continued until all of the Piedmont Traction Company's holdings were transferred to the Charlottesville City and Suburban Railway on July 31, 1896, at which time the operation of horse-drawn streetcars ceased.  Several other companies, including the Charlottesville and University Electric Light and Gas Company, the Consolidated Ice and Electric Company, and the Jefferson Park Company, were acquired by the Charlottesville City and Suburban Railway around 1900.  Having defaulted on six months of payments towards bonds and mortgages, the Charlottesville City and Suburban Railway was sold at public auction on November 10, 1903, after which it was reorganized as the Charlottesville and Albemarle Railway.\n\nExpansion, development, and decline\nAfter the reorganization of the company as the Charlottesville and Albemarle Railway in 1903, the new railway faced hardship in establishing a profitable business.  Charlottesville, as of the 1900 Census, had only a population of 6,449 people and few industries, making the development of an electric power provider and streetcar service difficult.  Furthermore, the company's electric power service, at that time using direct current, competed with the municipal gas provider.  The C&A's streetcar service was not expansive either, running for only  down Main Street from the C&O station west to the University of Virginia with multiple branches.  Thus, the C&A's profitability suffered and the railway went further into debt until it was purchased in 1912 by F.C. Todd, Norman James, and John L. Livers.  Under the new ownership, the company was revitalized with many improvements including the construction of a new power plant producing alternating current electricity, the purchase of one-man streetcars (operated by one man), and a refocus of the company's power service.\n\nThe C&A's  track was expanded by 1\u20442 mile (0.80\u00a0km) during this time to reach the University of Virginia's new stadium.  The new one-man streetcars required an alteration of the track at each end of the C&A's line to accommodate the turning of the cars.  After failing to receive permission from the C&O Railway to construct a loop at the C&O station, the C&A constructed a small turntable; however, this was later replaced by a loop.  The C&A also increased the number of Main Street sidings from three to five, thus reducing travel time to five minutes.\n\nBy 1922, the C&A had grown to serve 28,000 customers and employed 55 people.  This prosperity, however, would soon reverse with the coming of the Great Depression at the end of the decade.  Like many other transit companies, the C&A suffered financially during the depression.  With a decrease in ridership and increased operational costs, the C&A ended streetcar operations in 1935.  On February 2, 1936, the company was renamed as the Charlottesville and Albemarle Bus Company and began providing bus service.  Today, Charlottesville Area Transit provides bus transit in the Charlottesville area.\n\nOperation and infrastructure\n\nRoute Description\nAs of 1920, the C&A's line was approximately  long.  The line began at its easternmost point at the C&O Station and continued west down West Main Street.  At the intersection of West Main Street and Ridge Street, a short branch line down Ridge Street was in service to reach the company's car barn.  The main street line continued past Ridge Street, the Charlottesville Union Station, and passed over the Southern Railway tracks before coming to the junction of West Main Street and Jefferson Park Avenue approximately  west of the Southern tracks.  At this point the line split, with one line following Jefferson Park Avenue south for approximately  to Jefferson Park and Fry's Spring.  The other line, approximately  long, continued west on West Main Street to the University of Virginia, passing the Rotunda, before turning north on Rugby Road where the line ended just before reaching the C&O mainline.\n\nThe C&A's five passing sidings were located at the following locations:  approximately halfway between the C&O station and Ridge Street on West Main Street, at the intersection of West Main Street and Ridge Street, near the union station, before the intersection of West Main Street and Jefferson Park Avenue, and approximately halfway down the Jefferson Park Avenue branch.\n\nCompany headquarters\nIn 1914, the C&A began construction on a new company headquarters building at 300 West Main Street, which was completed in 1916.  Built in the Jeffersonian style of architecture, the new building featured red brick, white trim, and green shutters with bronze letters spelling the company name on the front.  The building served as the company's headquarters, a sales room, and an electrical substation.  The substation was attached to the rear of the office building and featured two 200-kilowatt converters and three 65-kilowatt transformers for the purpose of reducing the 2200-volt AC power generated at the power plant to 600-volt DC power for use in the street railway system.  The substation also contained devices to prepare the power for use in street lighting.  The Southern Railway took advantage of the substation and installed transformers, raising the voltage to 4400 volts, for use along the Southern's line between Calverton and Lynchburg.  The building has since become an office building.\n\nLocated behind the company headquarters building was the railway's car barn, the location where the streetcars were stored and maintained.  Though constructed of only leftover rail and corrugated iron, the car barn suited the railway's purpose, and most repair work was done in shop.  The car barn has since become the entrance to a Greyhound Lines bus station.\n\nPower plant\nThe C&A's original power plant was located within the city of Charlottesville and produced direct current power for distribution to city residents.  By the 1912 ownership change, this power plant had become worn and expensive to maintain, costing as much as 8\u00a2 per kilowatt hour (kWh) to generate electricity (equivalent today to $).  The plant also suffered from a flywheel explosion that caused $15,000 dollars worth of damage on February 14, 1913.  Because of the high expense, along with the difficulties of distributing DC power over an expanding system, the building of a new power plant to produce AC power was deemed necessary.\n\nA location was selected east of Charlottesville where the C&O mainline followed the Rivanna River, providing both an easy water supply and rail access.  The Red Land Power Corporation, chartered March 29, 1913, was charged to construct a 2,000-horsepower plant for the C&A and was merged into the C&A on November 25, 1913.  The old power plant was used temporarily, with new equipment, to produce AC power for the city as the new plant was being completed. Coal was provided to the new plant by way of rail, where a spur off of the C&O railway was provided to allow coal from hopper cars to be unloaded into a storage bin beneath.  Two 400\u00a0hp boilers were installed along with multiple turbines and generators in order to generate the electricity.  The completed plant produced 175,000 kWh per month as of 1914 and consumed four hopper cars worth of coal per month; this is contrasted with the old power plant's generation of 125,000 kWh per month consuming 14\u201315 cars worth, demonstrating the new plant's efficiency.\n\nJefferson Park\nJefferson Park, which was located near the university in western Charlottesville, was owned by the C&A.  The 13-acre park was improved in the mid-1910s with a renovated dance hall using materials harvested from a hotel that was torn down nearby.   The park also featured motion picture shows, boxball, roller-skating, and swings.  The C&A used the park's attractions to garner further passengers on its streetcar line.\n\nStreetcars\n\nThe C&A possessed multiple types of streetcars throughout its history.  Both open and closed cars were used by the C&A, with these cars seating an average of 24 passengers and weighing between .  The closed cars were refurbished as part of the series of upgrades across the line to include new interior paint, tungsten lamps, and orange and blue exterior paint, a move to make the cars \"more attractive to the students\" of the University of Virginia, as these were the school's colors.\n\nAlthough the old cars received cosmetic upgrades, the energy inefficiency of the cars, due in part to their heavy weight, caused the railway to seek a new and improved car.  Orders were placed with the J.G. Brill Company for five new near-side one-man streetcars sometime around 1913.  By June 1914, two additional cars were ordered and placed in service making for a total of seven new streetcars servicing Charlottesville.  These new cars offered multiple advantages to the company, as they were lighter, weighing around , seated 36 people, and could be operated by one man.  The near-side cars were in length  and rode on a single truck.  The benefits of the new cars allowed the company to scrap most of the older cars soon after the arrival of the new replacements.\n\nFuture plans\nThough the Charlottesville and Albemarle Railway's streetcars are long gone from Charlottesville, public transit is still of interest to the city.  Since the rise of the personal automobile, Charlottesville has struggled to provide an effective public transportation system.  Although bus service has been implemented under Charlottesville Area Transit, the city is challenged by expanding development and the lack of consumer willingness to use public transportation.  In the early 2000s, the city began planning and analyzing various methods of public transportation for implementation within Charlottesville, one of which includes the development of a streetcar system.  A 2005 study entitled Shaping Community with Transit laid out plans for the development of a streetcar system that would operate along West Main Street from the University of Virginia to downtown Charlottesville, following much of the same path as the Charlottesville and Albemarle Railway.  A Streetcar Task Force was created in December 2006 by the City Council to examine the feasibility of a streetcar system, though no concrete plans have been developed or implemented as of 2012.\n\nFootnotes\n\nReferences\n\nDefunct Virginia railroads\nRailway companies disestablished in 1936\nRailway companies established in 1903\nStreetcars in Virginia\nTransportation in Charlottesville, Virginia\n1903 establishments in Virginia\n1936 disestablishments in Virginia", "machine_text": "The Charlottesville and Albemarle Railway (C&A) is a short-line railroad operating in central Virginia in the United States.

Welcoming Troyanovsky, Roosevelt expressed his satisfaction at the appointment to the post of Soviet ambassador to Washington \"a man known for his friendly attitude towards the USA\". The years of Troyanovsky's tenure as plenipotentiary representative of the USSR were years of formation of Soviet-American relations and the first steps towards cooperation in the trade, economic, scientific and cultural fields. Troyanovsky played an important role in the conclusion of the 1935 Soviet-American trade agreement, which was renewed annually in subsequent years. Roosevelt once joked at one of the receptions in the White House: \"If Mr. Troyanovsky says, looking at the moon, that this is the sun, I personally, gentlemen, will believe him...\".\n\nHe had direct access to Stalin, to whom he reported on the strengths of American life that were considered to be adopted by the USSR. In his reports from Washington he advocated rapprochement with the United States in the face of the threat of Nazism.\n\nLater life \nFrom 1941 he taught at the Higher Diplomatic School of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union. From 1941 worked in the Soviet Information Bureau under the Council of Ministers of the USSR. From 1947 he was a professor at the Higher Diplomatic School.\n\nHe was a member of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union.\n\nTroyanovsky died on 23 June 1955, at the age of 73. He was buried at the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow. His son Oleg also became a Soviet diplomat and Soviet Union's permanent representative to the United Nations.\n\nReferences\n\n1882 births\n1955 deaths\nRussian revolutionaries\nMensheviks\nRussian Social Democratic Labour Party members\nOld Bolsheviks\nAmbassadors of the Soviet Union to the United States\nAmbassadors of the Soviet Union to Japan\nSoviet diplomats\nPeople of the Russian Civil War\nPeople of the Russian Revolution\nPeople of the Russo-Japanese War\nCentral Executive Committee of the Soviet Union members\nBurials at Novodevichy Cemetery", "machine_text": "Alexander Troyanovsky (born October 12, 1988) is a Russian businessman and entrepreneur.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Qin (state)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Qin () was an ancient Chinese state during the Zhou dynasty. Traditionally dated to 897 BC, it took its origin in a reconquest of western lands previously lost to the Rong; its position at the western edge of Chinese civilization permitted expansion and development that was unavailable to its rivals in the North China Plain. Following extensive \"Legalist\" reform in the 3rd century BC, Qin emerged as one of the dominant powers of the Seven Warring States and unified the seven states of China in 221 BC under Qin Shi Huang. The Qin dynasty it established was short-lived but greatly influenced later Chinese history.\n\nHistory\n\nFounding\n\nAccording to the 2nd century BC historical text Records of the Grand Historian by Sima Qian, the Qin state traced its origin to Zhuanxu, one of the legendary Five Emperors in ancient times.  One of his descendants, Boyi, was granted the family name of Y\u00edng by Emperor Shun. During the Xia and Shang dynasties, the Y\u00edng clan split in two: a western branch in that migrated across the Ordos Plateau to Quanqiu (present-day Lixian in Gansu), and an eastern branch that settled east of the Yellow River in modern Shanxi. The latter became the ancestors of the rulers of the later Zhao state.\n\nThe western Y\u00edng clan at Quanqiu were lords over the Xichui (\"Western March\") region west of Mount Long and served as a barrier for the Shang dynasty against invasions by the Western Rong barbarians. One of them, Elai, was killed defending King Zhou of Shang during the rebellion led by Ji Fa that established the Zhou dynasty. The Y\u00edng clan was however allied with the politically influential marquesses of Shen, whom the Zhou monarch relied upon heavily to manage the Rong people, and was thus allowed to retain their lands and continued serving as an attached vassal under the Zhou dynasty.  Feizi, a younger son of Elai's fourth-generation descendant Daluo, impressed King Xiao of Zhou so much with his horse breeding skills, that he was awarded a separate fief in the valley of Qin (present-day Qingshui and Zhangjiachuan County in Gansu) northeast of Quanqiu, and his seat was named Qinyi (in present-day Qintingzhen, Qingshui County). Both branches of the western Y\u00edng clan lived in the midst of the Rong tribes, sometimes fighting their armies and sometimes intermarrying with their kings.\n\nIt has been suggested by scholars such as Annette Juliano and Arthur Cotterel that having a horse-breeder as their ancestor may imply that the Y\u00edng family had a partial connection to nomadic tribes. As late as 266 BC, it was remarked by a noble of Wei that they shared customs with the Rong and Di tribes; the Central Plains states seemed to hold Qin culture and other peripheral states like Yan and Chu in low regard, due to the marginal location of their states.  Qin was the second state after Zhao to adopt cavalry tactics from the nomads.  Following the collapse of Zhou Dynasty, the Qin state absorbed cultures from two of the Four Barbarians from the west and north, which made the other warring states see their culture in low esteem. However, the Qin state was sensitive to the cultural discrimination by the Central Plains states and attempted to assert their Huaxia identity. This could be seen in an unusual statute of Qin Law, where mixed-ethnicity offsprings were all categorised as Huaxia, as well as in their preference for importing recruits from the neighbouring state of Jin.\n\nIn 842 BC, the nobles revolted against the corrupt King Li of Zhou in a coup known as the \"Countrymen's Riot\" (\u570b\u4eba\u66b4\u52d5), overthrowing him the following year, and the country subsequently fell into political turmoil.  The Xirong tribes used the opportunity to rebel against the Zhou dynasty, attacking and exterminating the senior branch of Y\u00edng clan at Quanqiu, leaving the cadet branch at Qinyi the only surviving Y\u00edng clan in the west.  After King Xuan of Zhou ascended the throne in 827 BC, he made Qin Zhong, Feizi's great grandson, the commander of his forces in the campaign against Xirong.  Two years later in 822 BC, Qin Zhong was killed in battle and was succeeded by his eldest son Duke Zhuang. To commemorating Qin Zhong's loyalty, King Xuan summoned Duke Zhuang and his four younger brothers and gave them 7,000 soldiers.  The Qin brothers successfully defeated the Rong and recovered their lost patrimony formerly held by the deceased branch of Y\u00edng clan, and King Xuan formally awarded them the territory of Quanqiu.  Duke Zhuang then moved his seat from Qinyi to Quanqiu, and had three sons.  When he died in 778 BC, his eldest son Shifu wanted to stay fighting the Xirong and avenge their grandfather, turning down the succession, so his second son Duke Xiang ascended as the clan leader.  Soon afterwards in 777 BC, Duke Xiang married his younger sister Mu Ying to a Rong leader called King Feng (\u8c50\u738b), in an apparent attempt to make peace.  The following year he moved the Qin capital eastward from Quanqiu to Qian (\u6c67, in present-day Long County, Shaanxi), but Quanqiu soon fell to the Rong again after he left.  His older brother Shifu, who led the defence of Quanqiu, was captured by the Rong but was released a year later.\n\nIn 771 BC, the Marquess of Shen collaborated with the Zeng state and the Quanrong nomads, attacked and sacked the Zhou capital Haojing, killing King You of Zhou and ending the Western Zhou dynasty.  Duke Xiang led his troops to escort King You's son King Ping to Luoyi, where the new capital city of the Eastern Zhou dynasty was established.  In gratitude of Duke Xiang's service, King Ping formally enfeoffed Duke Xiang as a feudal lord and elevated Qin from an \"attached state\" (\u9644\u5eb8 f\u00f9y\u014dng, a minor state with limited self-rule under the authority of another liege lord) to a major vassal state with full autonomy, and further promised to permanently grant Qin the lands west of Qishan, the former heartland of Zhou, if Qin could expel the Rong tribes that were occupying it.  The following generations of Qin rulers were encouraged by this promise, and they launched several military campaigns against the Rong, eventually expanding their territories far beyond the original lands lost by the Western Zhou dynasty.  The Qin state therefore viewed the Zhou rulers King Wen and Wu as their predecessors, and themselves as the legitimate inheritors of their legacy.\n\nSpring and Autumn period\n\nBecause their main concern was the Rongs to the west, Qin's interaction with other states in central China remained minimal throughout the Spring and Autumn period (722481BC), except with its immediate eastern neighbour Jin, a large vassal of the Zhou. Qin maintained good diplomatic relations with Jin through intermarriages between the royal clans, but relations between both sides had also deteriorated to the point of armed conflict on occasions.\n\nDuring the early reign of Duke Mu of Qin, the Jin state was a formidable power under the leadership of Duke Xian of Jin. However, after the death of Duke Xian, Jin plunged into a state of internal conflict as Duke Xian's sons fought over the succession. One of them won the contention and became Duke Hui of Jin, but Jin was struck by a famine not long later in 647 BC and Duke Hui requested aid from Qin.  Out of goodwill due to his marriage to Duke Hui's half-sister, Duke Mu sent relief food supplies and agricultural equipment to Jin. However, when Qin was struck by famine the next year, Duke Hui refused to reciprocate with help, leading to the diplomatic deterioration between Qin and Jin and a war breaking out in 645 BC, which ended with Duke Hui being defeated and captured. Duke Mu later released him back to Jin after the latter agreed to cede land and sign an alliance.\n\nDuring the battles with Jin, Duke Mu overheard that one of Duke Xian's exiled sons, Chong'er, was taking refuge in the Chu state. After consulting his subjects, Duke Mu sent an emissary to Chu to invite Chong'er over, and supported him in his challenge and eventual defeat of his brother Duke Hui. After Chong'er become the new ruler of Jin as Duke Wen, he was more grateful to Duke Mu and relations between the two states improved.  With his eastern front stable, Duke Mu used the opportunity to launch military campaigns against the Rong tribes in the west.\n\nIn 630 BC, Qin and Jin agreed to wage war on the state of Zheng, but Duke Mu was lobbied by the Zhen emissary to abandon the alliance.  In 627 BC, Duke Mu planned a secret attack on Zheng, but the Qin army retreated after being tricked into believing that Zheng was already prepared for Qin's invasion. By that point Duke Wen had died and his personal alliance with Duke Mu no longer stood, and his successor Duke Xiang ordered an ambush for the retreating Qin army.  The Qin forces were defeated at the Battle of Xiao (near present-day Luoning County, Henan) and suffered heavy casualties, and all three of its generals were captured. Three years later, Qin attacked Jin for revenge and scored a major victory. Duke Mu refused to advance further east after holding a posthumous funeral service for those killed in action at the Battle of Xiao, and went back to focus on the traditional policy of expanding Qin's dominance in the west.  Duke Mu's achievements in Qin's western campaigns and his handling of foreign relations with Jin earned him a position among the Five Hegemons of the Spring and Autumn period.\n\nIn 506 BC, King Hel\u00fc of Wu defeated Chu in the Battle of Boju and captured the Chu capital Ying (present day Jingzhou).  Hel\u00fc's advisor Wu Zixu, who was previously forced into exile by the already deceased King Ping of Chu and craved vengeance for the brutal execution of his father and brother, exhumed the King Ping's corpse and lashed it posthumously.  This was a great humiliation for the Chu state, so Shen Baoxu, a Chu official and a former friend of Wu Zixu, travelled to the Qin court and pleaded for assistance from Duke Ai of Qin to recover the capital.  After Duke Ai initially refused to help, Shen spent seven days crying in the palace courtyard, and Duke Ai was eventually moved by his devotion and agreed to send troops to assist Chu.  The famous poem named \"No Clothes\" (), recorded in the Classic of Poetry, was a battle hymn personally composed by Duke Ai to boost the morale of the Qin troops.  In 505 BC, the Qin and Chu armies jointly defeated Wu in several battles, allowing King Zhao of Chu to be restored and return to the recaptured capital.\n\nWarring States Period\n\nEarly decline\nDuring the early Warring States period, as its neighbours in the Central Plains began rapidly developing, Qin was still in a state of underdevelopment and decline.  The Wei state, formed from the Partition of Jin, became the most powerful state on Qin's eastern border.  Qin mostly relied on natural defenses such as the Hangu Pass (\u51fd\u8c37\u95dc; northeast of present-day Lingbao, Henan) and Wu Pass (\u6b66\u95dc, in present day Danfeng County) in the east, to protect its Guanzhong heartland.  Between 413 and 409 BC during the reign of Duke Jian of Qin, the Wei army led by Wu Qi, with support from Zhao and Han, attacked Qin and conquered some Qin territories west of the Yellow River.\n\nLegalist reforms\n\nAfter suffering losses in the battles with rival states such as Wei, the Qin rulers actively pursued legal, economic social reforms. When Duke Xiao came to the throne of Qin, he issued an announcement calling forth men of talent (including scholars, administrators, theorists and militarists) from other states to enter Qin and help him with his reforms, promising rewards of high offices and lands in return.\n\nAmong these foreign talents, Shang Yang successfully conducted a series of Legalist reforms in Qin with the support of Duke Xiao, despite facing strong opposition from conservative Qin politicians. Direct primogeniture was abolished, with all commoners granted citizenship rights. Many were resettled in new clusters focusing on increasing agricultural output. Meritocracy was practised throughout, especially in the military, with soldiers and officers receiving due rewards according to their contributions, regardless of their backgrounds. However, tough and strict laws were imposed as well, with draconian punishments being meted out for the slightest of offences, and even the nobility and royalty were not spared. After decades, the reforms strengthened Qin economically and militarily, and transformed it into a highly centralized state with an efficient administrative system.\n\nAfter Duke Xiao's death, King Huiwen became the new ruler of Qin and he put Shang Yang to death by chariot-tearing on charges of treason, but some believed that the king harboured a personal grudge against Shang because he was harshly punished for a minor infraction in his adolescence under Shang's reformed system. However, King Huiwen and his successors retained the reformed systems and they helped to lay the foundation for Qin's eventual unification of China under the Qin Dynasty in 221 BC. Shang Yang's theories were further elaborated later by Han Fei, another Legalist scholar who combined Shang's ideas with those of Shen Buhai and Shen Dao, that would form the core of the philosophies of Legalism. Qin rose to prominence in the late 3rd century BC after the reforms and emerged as one of the dominant superpowers of the Seven Warring States.\n\nAscendancy\nQin's power continued growing in the following century after Shang Yang's reform, owing the success to the industriousness of its people. The Qin kings authorized many state development projects, including large public works such as irrigation canals and defensive structures.\n\nOne of the most obvious results of the reforms was the change in Qin's military. Previously, the army was under the control of Qin's nobles and comprised feudal levies. After Shang Yang's reforms, the aristocracy system was abolished and replaced by one based on meritocracy, in which ordinary citizens had equal opportunities as the nobles to be promoted to high ranks. In addition, military discipline was strongly enforced and the troops were trained to adapt better to different battle situations. Qin's military strength increased largely with the full support of the state. In 318 BC, the states of Wei, Zhao, Han, Yan and Chu formed an alliance and attacked Qin, but did not manage to advance beyond Hangu Pass, and were defeated by counter-attacking Qin forces. The alliance crumbled due to mistrust and suspicion and lack of coordination among the five states.\n\nApart from the effects on Qin's military, Shang Yang's reforms also increased labour for numerous public works projects aimed at boosting agriculture, and made it possible for Qin to maintain and supply an active military force of more than a million troops. This feat could not be accomplished by any other state, except Chu, during that time. Qin's conquests of the southern states of Ba and Shu in present-day Sichuan province also provided Qin with major strategic advantages. The lands in the new territories were very fertile, and helped serve as a \"backyard\" for supplies and additional manpower. It was hard for Qin's rivals to attack Ba and Shu, since the territories were located deep in the mountains upstream of the Yangtze River. At the same time, Qin's strategic position in Ba and Shu provided it with a platform for launching attacks on the Chu state, which lies downstream of the Yangtze.\n\nWars against Chu, Han, and Wei\n\nDuring the reign of King Huiwen of Qin, the Chu state to the southeast became a target for Qin's aggression. Although Chu had the largest operation-ready army of all the Seven Warring States at over a million troops, its administrative and military strength was plagued by corruption and divided among the nobles. Zhang Yi, a Qin strategist, suggested to King Huiwen to exercise Qin's interest at the expense of Chu. Over the following years, Zhang engineered and executed a number of diplomatic plots against Chu, supported by the constant military raids on Chu's northwestern border. Chu suffered many defeats in battles against Qin and was forced to cede territories to Qin. King Huai I of Chu was furious and ordered a military campaign against Qin, but he was tricked by Zhang Yi into breaking diplomatic ties with his allies, and his angered allies joined Qin in inflicting a crushing defeat on Chu. In 299 BC, King Huai I was tricked into attending a diplomatic conference in Qin, where he was captured and held hostage until his death. In the meantime, Qin launched several attacks on Chu and eventually sacked the Chu capital city of Chen (\u9673; present-day Jiangling County, Hubei province). The crown prince of Chu fled east and was crowned King Qingxiang of Chu in the new capital city of Shouchun (\u58fd\u6625; present-day Shou County, Anhui province).\n\nIn the next five decades after King Huiwen's death, King Zhaoxiang of Qin shifted his attention to the Central Plains after the victories in the south against Chu. In the early years of King Zhaoxiang's reign, the Marquis of Rang (\u7a70\u4faf) served as Qin's chancellor and he actively pushed for military campaigns against the Qi state in the far eastern part of China. However, the marquis had his personal motives, as he intended to use Qin's powerful military to help him conquer a fief in Qi territories, since the lands were not directly linked to Qin and would not be under the Qin government's direct administration.\n\nSubsequently, King Zhaoxiang's foreign advisor, Fan Sui, advised the king to abandon those fruitless campaigns against distant states. King Zhaoxiang heeded Fan's advice and changed Qin's foreign policy to adopting good diplomatic relations with distant states (Yan and Qi), while concentrating on attacking nearby states (Zhao, Han and Wei). As a consequence, Qin began to launch constant attacks on Han and Wei over the next decades, conquering several territories in its campaigns. By then, Qin's territories had expanded to beyond the eastern shore of the Yellow River and Han and Wei were reduced to the status of \"buffers\" from Qin for the other states in the east.\n\nWars against Zhao\n\nStarting from 265 BC, Qin launched a massive invasion on Han and forced Han to cede its territory of Shangdang (\u4e0a\u9ee8; in present-day Shanxi province). However, Han offered Shangdang to Zhao instead, which led to a conflict between Qin and Zhao for control of Shangdang. Qin and Zhao engaged in the three-year-long Battle of Changping, followed by another three-year siege by Qin on Zhao's capital city of Handan. The conflict at Changping was deemed as a power struggle, as both sides pitted their forces against each other not only on the battlefield, but also in the domestic context. Although Qin had an abundance of resources and vast manpower, it had to enlist every man above the age of 15 for war-related duties, ranging from front-line service to logistics and agriculture. King Zhaoxiang of Qin even personally directed his army's supply lines. The extent of mobilization and the exhaustion in the aftermath was not seen in world history for another 2,000 years, until this concept of total war re-entered the stage during World War I. Qin's eventual victory in 260 BC was attributed to its use of schemes to stir up internal conflict in Zhao, which led to the replacement of Zhao's military leaders.\n\nFollowing the Qin victory at the Battle of Changping, the Qin commander Bai Qi ordered the 400,000 prisoners-of-war from Zhao to be executed by burying them alive. Subsequently, the Qin forces marched on the Zhao capital city of Handan in an attempt to conquer Zhao completely. However, the Qin troops were unable to capture Handan as they were already exhausted and also because the Zhao forces put up fierce resistance. King Xiaocheng of Zhao offered six cities to Qin as a peace offer and King Zhaoxiang of Qin accepted the offer after being persuaded by Fan Sui. Within Zhao, many officials strongly opposed King Xiaocheng's decision to give up the cities and subsequent delays caused the siege on Handan to be prolonged until 258 BC. Meanwhile, Bai Qi was consecutively replaced by Wang Xi, Wang Ling and Zheng Anping as the Qin commander at the siege.\n\nIn 257 BC, Qin was still unable to penetrate Handan after besieging it for three years, and Zhao requested aid from the neighbouring states of Wei and Chu. Wei was hesitant to help Zhao initially, but launched an attack on Qin after seeing that Qin was already exhausted after years of war. The Qin forces crumbled and retreated and Zheng Anping surrendered. The combined forces of Wei and Chu continued to pursue the retreating Qin army and Wei managed to retake part of its original lands that were lost to Qin earlier.\n\nInfrastructural works\nIn the middle of the 3rd century BC, Zheng Guo, a hydraulic engineer from the Han state, was sent to Qin to advise King Zhaoxiang of Qin on constructing irrigation canals. Qin had a penchant for building large-scale canals, as evident from its Min River irrigation system. King Zhaoxiang approved Zheng Guo's idea on constructing an even bigger canal. The project was completed in 264 BC and the canal was named after Zheng. Qin benefitted from the project as it became one of the most fertile states in China due to the good irrigation system, and also because it could now raise more troops as a consequence of increased agricultural yield.\n\nUnification\n\nIn 247 BC, the 13-year-old Ying Zheng became king of Qin after the sudden death of King Zhuangxiang. However, Ying Zheng did not wield state power fully in his hands until 238 BC, after eliminating his political rivals L\u00fc Buwei and Lao Ai. Ying formulated a plan for conquering the other six states and unifying China with help from Li Si and Wei Liao.\n\nIn 230 BC, Qin attacked Han, the weakest of the Seven Warring States, and succeeded in conquering Han within a year. Since 236 BC, Qin had been launching several assaults on Zhao, which had been devastated by its calamitous defeat at the Battle of Changping three decades ago. Although Qin faced strong resistance from the Zhao forces, led by general Li Mu, it still managed to defeat the Zhao army by using a ploy to sow discord between King Qian of Zhao and Li Mu, causing King Qian to order Li Mu's execution and replace Li with the less competent Zhao Cong. Zhao eventually fell to Qin in 228 BC after the capital city of Handan was taken. However, a Zhao noble managed to escape with remnant forces and proclaim himself king in Dai. Dai fell to Qin six years later.\n\nAfter the fall of Zhao, Qin turned its attention towards Yan. Crown Prince Dan of Yan sent Jing Ke to assassinate Ying Zheng but the assassination attempt failed and Qin used that as an excuse to attack Yan. Yan lost to Qin at a battle on the eastern bank of the Yi River in 226 BC and King Xi of Yan fled with remnant forces to Liaodong. Qin attacked Yan again in 222 BC and annexed Yan completely. In 225 BC, the Qin army led by Wang Ben invaded Wei and besieged Wei's capital city of Daliang for three months. Wang directed the waters from the Yellow River and the Hong Canal to flood Daliang and King Jia of Wei surrendered and Wei was conquered.\n\nIn 224 BC, Qin prepared for an attack on Chu, its most powerful rival among the six states. During a discussion between Ying Zheng and his subjects, the veteran general Wang Jian claimed that the invasion force needed to be at least 600,000 strong, but the younger general Li Xin thought that 200,000 men would be sufficient. Ying Zheng put Li Xin in command of the Qin army to attack Chu. The Chu defenders, led by Xiang Yan, took Li Xin's army by surprise and defeated the Qin invaders. The defeat was deemed as the greatest setback for Qin in its wars to unify China. Ying Zheng put Wang Jian in command of the 600,000 strong army as he had requested and ordered Wang to lead another attack on Chu. Wang scored a major victory against the Chu forces in 224 BC and Xiang Yan was killed in action. The following year, Qin pushed on and captured Chu's capital city of Shouchun, bringing an end to Chu's existence. In 222 BC, the Qin army advanced southward and annexed the Wuyue region (covering present-day Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces).\n\nBy 221 BC, Qi was the only rival state left. Qin advanced into the heartland of Qi via a southern detour, avoiding direct confrontation with the Qi forces on Qi's western border and arrived at Qi's capital city of Linzi swiftly. The Qi forces were taken by surprise and surrendered without putting up resistance. Following the fall of Qi in 221 BC, China was unified under the rule of Qin. Ying Zheng declared himself \"Qin Shi Huang\" (meaning \"First Emperor of Qin\") and founded the Qin Dynasty, becoming the first sovereign ruler of a united China.\n\nCulture and society\n\nBefore Qin unified China, each state had its own customs and culture. According to the Yu Gong or Tribute of Yu, composed in the 4th or 5th century BC and included in the Book of Documents, there were nine distinct cultural regions of China, which are described in detail in this book. The work focuses on the travels of the titular sage, Yu the Great, throughout each of the regions. Other texts, predominantly military, also discussed these cultural variations.\n\nOne of these texts was The Book of Master Wu, written in response to a query by Marquis Wu of Wei on how to cope with the military threat posed by competing states. Wu Qi, the author of the work, declared that the government and nature of the people were reflective of the terrain they live in.

The state was located in the western part of modern-day Shaanxi province, and it was bordered by the states of Zhou, Wei, Chu, and Yan. Qin is best known for its military success under the ruler Ying Zheng, who later became the first emperor of a unified China. The origins of the Qin state can be traced back to the 9th century BCE, when its ancestors were one of the many small states that emerged during the Zhou dynasty. However, it was not until the 4th century BCE that Qin started to emerge as a major power. Its early rulers, including Duke Xiao and Duke Mu, adopted a policy of territorial expansion, diplomacy, and military reforms. They also took advantage of the decline of the Zhou dynasty and the weakening of its feudal system. During the 3rd century BCE, the Qin state began a series of wars of unification. The campaigns were led by the ruler Ying Zheng, who was later known as Qin Shi Huang, or the First Emperor. The conquests of Qin included the states of Han, Zhao, Yan, Wei, and Chu. The military success of Qin was due to its efficient army, which was organized into units of 5,000 soldiers, and its use of crossbowmen and cavalry. Qin also implemented a strict legal code, enforced by officials appointed by the central government. In 221 BCE, Ying Zheng declared himself the First Emperor of China, and he unified the country under the Qin dynasty. His reign was characterized by political centralization, legal reforms, the construction of the Great Wall of China, and the standardization of weights, measures, and writing. However, his rule was also marked by authoritarianism, brutality, and the persecution of Confucian scholars. The downfall of the Qin dynasty came after the death of Ying Zheng in 210 BCE. The imperial court was plagued by power struggles, peasant revolts, and the invasion of the Xiongnu, a nomadic tribe from the north. In 206 BCE, the Han dynasty emerged as the new ruling dynasty of China, and it marked the end of the Qin state. Despite its short existence, Qin left a lasting legacy in Chinese history as the first dynasty to unify China and lay the foundations for the imperial system that lasted for centuries.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 361005}

The peak was first climbed by a team of Indian mountaineers in 1989. The climbers were led by Harish Kapadia and included Sherpa Ang Kami Sherpa, M. Basheer, and B.K. Chaudhary. They reached the summit on September 12, 1989, via the east ridge. Since then, the peak has been climbed by several mountaineering expeditions from different parts of the world. The peak is located in a remote area surrounded by other Himalayan peaks, such as Dunagiri, Changabang, and Kalanka. It offers a panoramic view of the surrounding peaks and is a challenging climb due to its steep slopes and unpredictable weather conditions. The climb to the summit requires technical skills, endurance, and experience in high-altitude mountaineering. The climbing season for Ustra Peak is from May to June and September to October. The weather conditions during these months are generally favorable for climbing. However, climbers need to prepare themselves for sudden weather changes, as the weather in the Himalayas can be highly unpredictable. The ascent to Ustra Peak starts from the base camp, which can be reached by trekking from Joshimath, a town in the Chamoli district. The climb to the summit takes around five to six days and involves setting up several camps along the way. In addition to its significance as a mountaineering destination, Ustra Peak is also known for its scenic beauty and rich biodiversity. It is home to several rare and endangered species of flora and fauna and is a crucial part of the fragile Himalayan ecosystem. In conclusion, Ustra Peak is a challenging yet rewarding climb that offers a glimpse into the majestic beauty of the Himalayas.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Auguste Rodin\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Fran\u00e7ois Auguste Ren\u00e9 Rodin (12 November 184017 November 1917) was a French sculptor generally considered the founder of modern sculpture. He was schooled traditionally and took a craftsman-like approach to his work. Rodin possessed a unique ability to model a complex, turbulent, and deeply pocketed surface in clay. He is known for such sculptures as The Thinker, Monument to Balzac, The Kiss, The Burghers of Calais, and The Gates of Hell.\n\nMany of Rodin's most notable sculptures were criticized, as they clashed with predominant figurative sculpture traditions in which works were decorative, formulaic, or highly thematic. Rodin's most original work departed from traditional themes of mythology and allegory. He modeled the human body with naturalism, and his sculptures celebrate individual character and physicality. Although Rodin was sensitive to the controversy surrounding his work, he refused to change his style, and his continued output brought increasing favor from the government and the artistic community.\n\nFrom the unexpected naturalism of Rodin's first major figure \u2013 inspired by his 1875 trip to Italy \u2013 to the unconventional memorials whose commissions he later sought, his reputation grew, and Rodin became the preeminent French sculptor of his time. By 1900, he was a world-renowned artist. Wealthy private clients sought Rodin's work after his World's Fair exhibit, and he kept company with a variety of high-profile intellectuals and artists. His student, Camille Claudel, became his associate, lover, and creative rival. Rodin's other students included Antoine Bourdelle, Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i, and Charles Despiau. He married his lifelong companion, Rose Beuret, in the last year of both their lives. His sculptures suffered a decline in popularity after his death in 1917, but within a few decades his legacy solidified. Rodin remains one of the few sculptors widely known outside the visual arts community.\n\nBiography\n\nFormative years\nRodin was born in 1840 into a working-class family in Paris, the second child of Marie Cheffer and Jean-Baptiste Rodin, who was a police department clerk. He was largely self-educated, and began to draw at age 10. Between ages 14 and 17, he attended the Petite \u00c9cole, a school specializing in art and mathematics where he studied drawing and painting. His drawing teacher Horace Lecoq de Boisbaudran believed in first developing the personality of his students so that they observed with their own eyes and drew from their recollections, and Rodin expressed appreciation for his teacher much later in life. It was at Petite \u00c9cole that he met Jules Dalou and Alphonse Legros.\n\nIn 1857, Rodin submitted a clay model of a companion to the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in an attempt to win entrance; he did not succeed, and two further applications were also denied. Entrance requirements were not particularly high at the Grande \u00c9cole, so the rejections were considerable setbacks. Rodin's inability to gain entrance may have been due to the judges' Neoclassical tastes, while Rodin had been schooled in light, 18th-century sculpture. He left the Petite \u00c9cole in 1857 and earned a living as a craftsman and ornamenter for most of the next two decades, producing decorative objects and architectural embellishments.\n\nRodin's sister Maria, two years his senior, died of peritonitis in a convent in 1862, and Rodin was anguished with guilt because he had introduced her to an unfaithful suitor. He turned away from art and joined the Catholic order of the Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament. Saint Peter Julian Eymard, founder and head of the congregation, recognized Rodin's talent and sensed his lack of suitability for the order, so he encouraged Rodin to continue with his sculpture. Rodin returned to work as a decorator while taking classes with animal sculptor Antoine-Louis Barye. The teacher's attention to detail and his finely rendered musculature of animals in motion significantly influenced Rodin.\n\nIn 1864, Rodin began to live with a young seamstress named Rose Beuret (born in June 1844), with whom he stayed for the rest of his life, with varying commitment. The couple had a son named Auguste-Eug\u00e8ne Beuret (1866\u20131934). That year, Rodin offered his first sculpture for exhibition and entered the studio of Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse, a successful mass producer of objets d'art. Rodin worked as Carrier-Belleuse' chief assistant until 1870, designing roof decorations and staircase and doorway embellishments. With the arrival of the Franco-Prussian War, Rodin was called to serve in the French National Guard, but his service was brief due to his near-sightedness. Decorators' work had dwindled because of the war, yet Rodin needed to support his family, as poverty was a continual difficulty for him until about the age of 30. Carrier-Belleuse soon asked him to join him in Belgium, where they worked on ornamentation for the Brussels Stock Exchange.\n\nRodin planned to stay in Belgium a few months, but he spent the next six years outside of France. It was a pivotal time in his life. He had acquired skill and experience as a craftsman, but no one had yet seen his art, which sat in his workshop since he could not afford castings. His relationship with Carrier-Belleuse had deteriorated, but he found other employment in Brussels, displaying some works at salons, and his companion Rose soon joined him there. Having saved enough money to travel, Rodin visited Italy for two months in 1875, where he was drawn to the work of Donatello and Michelangelo. Their work had a profound effect on his artistic direction. Rodin said, \"It is Michelangelo who has freed me from academic sculpture.\" Returning to Belgium, he began work on The Age of Bronze, a life-size male figure whose naturalism brought Rodin attention but led to accusations of sculptural cheatingits naturalism and scale was such that critics alleged he had cast the work from a living model. Much of Rodin's later work was explicitly larger or smaller than life, in part to demonstrate the folly of such accusations.\n\nArtistic independence\n\nRose Beuret and Rodin returned to Paris in 1877, moving into a small flat on the Left Bank. Misfortune surrounded Rodin: his mother, who had wanted to see her son marry, was dead, and his father was blind and senile, cared for by Rodin's sister-in-law, Aunt Th\u00e9r\u00e8se. Rodin's eleven-year-old son Auguste, possibly developmentally delayed, was also in the ever-helpful Th\u00e9r\u00e8se's care. Rodin had essentially abandoned his son for six years, and would have a very limited relationship with him throughout his life. Father and son joined the couple in their flat, with Rose as caretaker. Charges of fakery surrounding The Age of Bronze continued. Rodin increasingly sought soothing female companionship in Paris, and Rose stayed in the background.\n\nRodin earned his living collaborating with more established sculptors on public commissions, primarily memorials and neo-baroque architectural pieces in the style of Carpeaux. In competitions for commissions he submitted models of Denis Diderot, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Lazare Carnot, all to no avail. On his own time, he worked on studies leading to the creation of his next important work, St. John the Baptist Preaching.\n\nIn 1880, Carrier-Belleuse\u00a0\u2013 then art director of the S\u00e8vres national porcelain factory\u00a0\u2013 offered Rodin a part-time position as a designer. The offer was in part a gesture of reconciliation, and Rodin accepted. That part of Rodin which appreciated 18th-century tastes was aroused, and he immersed himself in designs for vases and table ornaments that brought the factory renown across Europe.\n\nThe artistic community appreciated his work in this vein, and Rodin was invited to Paris Salons by such friends as writer L\u00e9on Cladel. During his early appearances at these social events, Rodin seemed shy; in his later years, as his fame grew, he displayed the loquaciousness and temperament for which he is better known. French statesman Leon Gambetta expressed a desire to meet Rodin, and the sculptor impressed him when they met at a salon. Gambetta spoke of Rodin in turn to several government ministers, likely including , the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Fine Arts, whom Rodin eventually met.\n\nRodin's relationship with Turquet was rewarding: through him, he won the 1880 commission to create a portal for a planned museum of decorative arts. Rodin dedicated much of the next four decades to his elaborate Gates of Hell, an unfinished portal for a museum that was never built. Many of the portal's figures became sculptures in themselves, including Rodin's most famous, The Thinker and The Kiss. With the museum commission came a free studio, granting Rodin a new level of artistic freedom. Soon, he stopped working at the porcelain factory; his income came from private commissions.\n\nIn 1883, Rodin agreed to supervise a course for sculptor Alfred Boucher in his absence, where he met the 18-year-old Camille Claudel. The two formed a passionate but stormy relationship and influenced each other artistically. Claudel inspired Rodin as a model for many of his figures, and she was a talented sculptor, assisting him on commissions as well as creating her own works. Her Bust of Rodin was displayed to critical acclaim at the 1892 Salon.\n\nAlthough busy with The Gates of Hell, Rodin won other commissions. He pursued an opportunity to create a historical monument for the town of Calais. For a monument to French author Honor\u00e9 de Balzac, Rodin was chosen in 1891. His execution of both sculptures clashed with traditional tastes, and met with varying degrees of disapproval from the organizations that sponsored the commissions. Still, Rodin was gaining support from diverse sources that propelled him toward fame.\n\nIn 1889, the Paris Salon invited Rodin to be a judge on its artistic jury. Though Rodin's career was on the rise, Claudel and Beuret were becoming increasingly impatient with Rodin's \"double life\". Claudel and Rodin shared an atelier at a small old castle (the Ch\u00e2teau de l'Islette in the Loire), but Rodin refused to relinquish his ties to Beuret, his loyal companion during the lean years, and mother of his son. During one absence, Rodin wrote to Beuret, \"I think of how much you must have loved me to put up with my caprices...I remain, in all tenderness, your Rodin.\"\n\nClaudel and Rodin parted in 1898. Claudel suffered an alleged nervous breakdown several years later and was confined to an institution for 30 years by her family, until her death in 1943, despite numerous attempts by doctors to explain to her mother and brother that she was sane.\n\nWorks\n\nIn 1864, Rodin submitted his first sculpture for exhibition, The Man with the Broken Nose, to the Paris Salon. The subject was an elderly neighborhood street porter. The unconventional bronze piece was not a traditional bust, but instead the head was \"broken off\" at the neck, the nose was flattened and crooked, and the back of the head was absent, having fallen off the clay model in an accident. The work emphasized texture and the emotional state of the subject; it illustrated the \"unfinishedness\" that would characterize many of Rodin's later sculptures. The Salon rejected the piece.\n\nEarly figures: the inspiration of Italy\nIn Brussels, Rodin created his first full-scale work, The Age of Bronze, having returned from Italy. Modeled after a Belgian soldier, the figure drew inspiration from Michelangelo's Dying Slave, which Rodin had observed at the Louvre. Attempting to combine Michelangelo's mastery of the human form with his own sense of human nature, Rodin studied his model from all angles, at rest and in motion; he mounted a ladder for additional perspective, and made clay models, which he studied by candlelight. The result was a life-size, well-proportioned nude figure, posed unconventionally with his right hand atop his head, and his left arm held out at his side, forearm parallel to the body.\n\nIn 1877, the work debuted in Brussels and then was shown at the Paris Salon. The statue's apparent lack of a theme was troubling to critics\u00a0\u2013 commemorating neither mythology nor a noble historical event\u00a0\u2013 and it is not clear whether Rodin intended a theme. He first titled the work The Vanquished, in which form the left hand held a spear, but he removed the spear because it obstructed the torso from certain angles. After two more intermediary titles, Rodin settled on The Age of Bronze, suggesting the Bronze Age, and in Rodin's words, \"man arising from nature\". Later, however, Rodin said that he had had in mind \"just a simple piece of sculpture without reference to subject\".\n\nIts mastery of form, light, and shadow made the work look so naturalistic that Rodin was accused of surmoulage\u00a0\u2013 having taken a cast from a living model. Rodin vigorously denied the charges, writing to newspapers and having photographs taken of the model to prove how the sculpture differed. He demanded an inquiry and was eventually exonerated by a committee of sculptors. Leaving aside the false charges, the piece polarized critics. It had barely won acceptance for display at the Paris Salon, and criticism likened it to \"a statue of a sleepwalker\" and called it \"an astonishingly accurate copy of a low type\". Others rallied to defend the piece and Rodin's integrity. The government minister Turquet admired the piece, and The Age of Bronze was purchased by the state for 2,200 francs\u00a0\u2013 what it had cost Rodin to have it cast in bronze.\n\nA second male nude, St. John the Baptist Preaching, was completed in 1878. Rodin sought to avoid another charge of surmoulage by making the statue larger than life: St. John stands almost . While The Age of Bronze is statically posed, St. John gestures and seems to move toward the viewer. The effect of walking is achieved despite the figure having both feet firmly on the ground\u00a0\u2013 a technical achievement that was lost on most contemporary critics. Rodin chose this contradictory position to, in his words, \"display simultaneously...views of an object which in fact can be seen only successively\".\n\nDespite the title, St. John the Baptist Preaching did not have an obviously religious theme. The model, an Italian peasant who presented himself at Rodin's studio, possessed an idiosyncratic sense of movement that Rodin felt compelled to capture. Rodin thought of John the Baptist, and carried that association into the title of the work. In 1880, Rodin submitted the sculpture to the Paris Salon. Critics were still mostly dismissive of his work, but the piece finished third in the Salon's sculpture category.\n\nRegardless of the immediate receptions of St. John and The Age of Bronze, Rodin had achieved a new degree of fame. Students sought him at his studio, praising his work and scorning the charges of surmoulage. The artistic community knew his name.\n\nThe Gates of Hell\n\nA commission to create a portal for Paris' planned Museum of Decorative Arts was awarded to Rodin in 1880. Although the museum was never built, Rodin worked throughout his life on The Gates of Hell, a monumental sculptural group depicting scenes from Dante's Inferno in high relief. Often lacking a clear conception of his major works, Rodin compensated with hard work and a striving for perfection.\n\nHe conceived The Gates with the surmoulage controversy still in mind: \"...I had made the St. John to refute [the charges of casting from a model], but it only partially succeeded. To prove completely that I could model from life as well as other sculptors, I determined...to make the sculpture on the door of figures smaller than life.\" Laws of composition gave way to the Gates''' disordered and untamed depiction of Hell. The figures and groups in this, Rodin's meditation on the condition of man, are physically and morally isolated in their torment.The Gates of Hell comprised 186 figures in its final form. Many of Rodin's best-known sculptures started as designs of figures for this composition, such as The Thinker, The Three Shades, and The Kiss, and were only later presented as separate and independent works. Other well-known works derived from The Gates are Ugolino, Fallen Caryatid Carrying her Stone, Fugit Amor, She Who Was Once the Helmet-Maker's Beautiful Wife, The Falling Man, and The Prodigal Son.The Thinker (originally titled The Poet, after Dante) was to become one of the best-known sculptures in the world. The original was a  high bronze piece created between 1879 and 1889, designed for the Gates' lintel, from which the figure would gaze down upon Hell. While The Thinker most obviously characterizes Dante, aspects of the Biblical Adam, the mythological Prometheus, and Rodin himself have been ascribed to him. Other observers de-emphasize the apparent intellectual theme of The Thinker, stressing the figure's rough physicality and the emotional tension emanating from it.\n\nThe Burghers of Calais\n\nThe town of Calais had contemplated a historical monument for decades when Rodin learned of the project. He pursued the commission, interested in the medieval motif and patriotic theme. The mayor of Calais was tempted to hire Rodin on the spot upon visiting his studio, and soon the memorial was approved, with Rodin as its architect. It would commemorate the six townspeople of Calais who offered their lives to save their fellow citizens.\n\nDuring the Hundred Years' War, the army of King Edward III besieged Calais, and Edward ordered that the town's population be killed en masse. He agreed to spare them if six of the principal citizens would come to him prepared to die, bareheaded and barefooted and with ropes around their necks. When they came, he ordered that they be executed, but pardoned them when his queen, Philippa of Hainault, begged him to spare their lives. The Burghers of Calais depicts the men as they are leaving for the king's camp, carrying keys to the town's gates and citadel.\n\nRodin began the project in 1884, inspired by the chronicles of the siege by Jean Froissart. Though the town envisioned an allegorical, heroic piece centered on Eustache de Saint-Pierre, the eldest of the six men, Rodin conceived the sculpture as a study in the varied and complex emotions under which all six men were laboring. One year into the commission, the Calais committee was not impressed with Rodin's progress. Rodin indicated his willingness to end the project rather than change his design to meet the committee's conservative expectations, but Calais said to continue.\n\nIn 1889, The Burghers of Calais was first displayed to general acclaim. It is a bronze sculpture weighing , and its figures are  tall. The six men portrayed do not display a united, heroic front; rather, each is isolated from his brothers, individually deliberating and struggling with his expected fate. Rodin soon proposed that the monument's high pedestal be eliminated, wanting to move the sculpture to ground level so that viewers could \"penetrate to the heart of the subject\". At ground level, the figures' positions lead the viewer around the work, and subtly suggest their common movement forward.\n\nThe committee was incensed by the untraditional proposal, but Rodin would not yield. In 1895, Calais succeeded in having Burghers displayed in their preferred form: the work was placed in front of a public garden on a high platform, surrounded by a cast-iron railing. Rodin had wanted it located near the town hall, where it would engage the public. Only after damage during the First World War, subsequent storage, and Rodin's death was the sculpture displayed as he had intended. It is one of Rodin's best-known and most acclaimed works.\n\nCommissions and controversy \n\nCommissioned to create a monument to French writer Victor Hugo in 1889, Rodin dealt extensively with the subject of artist and muse. Like many of Rodin's public commissions, Monument to Victor Hugo was met with resistance because it did not fit conventional expectations. Commenting on Rodin's monument to Victor Hugo, The Times in 1909 expressed that \"there is some show of reason in the complaint that [Rodin's] conceptions are sometimes unsuited to his medium, and that in such cases they overstrain his vast technical powers\". The 1897 plaster model was not cast in bronze until 1964.\n\nThe Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Gens des Lettres, a Parisian organization of writers, planned a monument to French novelist Honor\u00e9 de Balzac immediately after his death in 1850. The society commissioned Rodin to create the memorial in 1891, and Rodin spent years developing the concept for his sculpture. Challenged in finding an appropriate representation of Balzac given the author's rotund physique, Rodin produced many studies: portraits, full-length figures in the nude, wearing a frock coat, or in a robe\u00a0\u2013 a replica of which Rodin had requested. The realized sculpture displays Balzac cloaked in the drapery, looking forcefully into the distance with deeply gouged features. Rodin's intent had been to show Balzac at the moment of conceiving a work\u00a0\u2013 to express courage, labor, and struggle.\n\nWhen Balzac was exhibited in 1898, the negative reaction was not surprising. The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 rejected the work, and the press ran parodies. Criticizing the work, Morey (1918) reflected, \"there may come a time, and doubtless will come a time, when it will not seem outre to represent a great novelist as a huge comic mask crowning a bathrobe, but even at the present day this statue impresses one as slang.\" A modern critic, indeed, claims that Balzac is one of Rodin's masterpieces.\n\nThe monument had its supporters in Rodin's day; a manifesto defending him was signed by Monet, Debussy, and future Premier Georges Clemenceau, among many others. In the BBC series Civilisation, art historian Kenneth Clark praised the monument as \"the greatest piece of sculpture of the 19th Century, perhaps, indeed, the greatest since Michelangelo.\" Rather than try to convince skeptics of the merit of the monument, Rodin repaid the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 his commission and moved the figure to his garden. After this experience, Rodin did not complete another public commission. Only in 1939 was Monument to Balzac cast in bronze and placed on the Boulevard du Montparnasse at the intersection with Boulevard Raspail.\n\nOther works\n\nThe popularity of Rodin's most famous sculptures tends to obscure his total creative output. A prolific artist, he created thousands of busts, figures, and sculptural fragments over more than five decades. He painted in oils (especially in his thirties) and in watercolors. The Mus\u00e9e Rodin holds 7,000 of his drawings and prints, in chalk and charcoal, and thirteen vigorous drypoints. He also produced a single lithograph.\n\nPortraiture was an important component of Rodin's oeuvre, helping him to win acceptance and financial independence. His first sculpture was a bust of his father in 1860, and he produced at least 56 portraits between 1877 and his death in 1917. Early subjects included fellow sculptor Jules Dalou (1883) and companion Camille Claudel (1884).\n\nLater, with his reputation established, Rodin made busts of prominent contemporaries such as English politician George Wyndham (1905), Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw (1906), socialist (and former mistress of the Prince of Wales who became King Edward VII) Countess of Warwick (1908), Austrian composer Gustav Mahler (1909), former Argentine president Domingo Faustino Sarmiento and French statesman Georges Clemenceau (1911).\n\nHis undated drawing Study of a Woman Nude, Standing, Arms Raised, Hands Crossed Above Head is one of the works seized in 2012 from the collection of Cornelius Gurlitt.\n\nAesthetic\n\nRodin was a naturalist, less concerned with monumental expression than with character and emotion. Departing with centuries of tradition, he turned away from the idealism of the Greeks, and the decorative beauty of the Baroque and neo-Baroque movements. His sculpture emphasized the individual and the concreteness of flesh, and suggested emotion through detailed, textured surfaces, and the interplay of light and shadow. To a greater degree than his contemporaries, Rodin believed that an individual's character was revealed by his physical features.\n\nRodin's talent for surface modeling allowed him to let every part of the body speak for the whole. The male's passion in The Thinker is suggested by the grip of his toes on the rock, the rigidness of his back, and the differentiation of his hands. Speaking of The Thinker, Rodin illuminated his aesthetic: \"What makes my Thinker think is that he thinks not only with his brain, with his knitted brow, his distended nostrils and compressed lips, but with every muscle of his arms, back, and legs, with his clenched fist and gripping toes.\"\n\nSculptural fragments to Rodin were autonomous works, and he considered them the essence of his artistic statement. His fragments\u00a0\u2013 perhaps lacking arms, legs, or a head\u00a0\u2013 took sculpture further from its traditional role of portraying likenesses, and into a realm where forms existed for their own sake. Notable examples are The Walking Man, Meditation without Arms, and Iris, Messenger of the Gods.\n\nRodin saw suffering and conflict as hallmarks of modern art. \"Nothing, really, is more moving than the maddened beast, dying from unfulfilled desire and asking in vain for grace to quell its passion.\" Charles Baudelaire echoed those themes, and was among Rodin's favorite poets. Rodin enjoyed music, especially the opera composer Gluck, and wrote a book about French cathedrals. He owned a work by the as-yet-unrecognized Van Gogh, and admired the forgotten El Greco.\n\nMethod\nInstead of copying traditional academic postures, Rodin preferred his models to move naturally around his studio (despite their nakedness). The sculptor often made quick sketches in clay that were later fine-tuned, cast in plaster, and cast in bronze or carved from marble. Rodin's focus was on the handling of clay.\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw sat for a portrait and gave an idea of Rodin's technique: \"While he worked, he achieved a number of miracles. At the end of the first fifteen minutes, after having given a simple idea of the human form to the block of clay, he produced by the action of his thumb a bust so living that I would have taken it away with me to relieve the sculptor of any further work.\"\n\nHe described the evolution of his bust over a month, passing through \"all the stages of art's evolution\": first, a \"Byzantine masterpiece\", then \"Bernini intermingled\", then an elegant Houdon. \"The hand of Rodin worked not as the hand of a sculptor works, but as the work of Elan Vital. The Hand of God is his own hand.\"\n\nAfter he completed his work in clay, he employed highly skilled assistants to re-sculpt his compositions at larger sizes (including any of his large-scale monuments such as The Thinker), to cast the clay compositions into plaster or bronze, and to carve his marbles. Rodin's major innovation was to capitalize on such multi-staged processes of 19th century sculpture and their reliance on plaster casting.\n\nSince clay deteriorates rapidly if not kept wet or fired into a terra-cotta, sculptors used plaster casts as a means of securing the composition they would make from the fugitive material that is clay. This was common practice amongst Rodin's contemporaries, and sculptors would exhibit plaster casts with the hopes that they would be commissioned to have the works made in a more permanent material. Rodin, however, would have multiple plasters made and treat them as the raw material of sculpture, recombining their parts and figures into new compositions, and new names.\n\nAs Rodin's practice developed into the 1890s, he became more and more radical in his pursuit of fragmentation, the combination of figures at different scales, and the making of new compositions from his earlier work. A prime example of this is the bold The Walking Man (1899\u20131900), which was exhibited at his major one-person show in 1900. This is composed of two sculptures from the 1870s that Rodin found in his studio\u00a0\u2013 a broken and damaged torso that had fallen into neglect and the lower extremities of a statuette version of his 1878 St. John the Baptist Preaching he was having re-sculpted at a reduced scale.\n\nWithout finessing the join between upper and lower, between torso and legs, Rodin created a work that many sculptors at the time and subsequently have seen as one of his strongest and most singular works. This is despite the fact that the object conveys two different styles, exhibits two different attitudes toward finish, and lacks any attempt to hide the arbitrary fusion of these two components. It was the freedom and creativity with which Rodin used these practices\u00a0\u2013 along with his activation surfaces of sculptures through traces of his own touch and with his more open attitude toward bodily pose, sensual subject matter, and non-naturalistic surface\u00a0\u2013 that marked Rodin's re-making of traditional 19th century sculptural techniques into the prototype for modern sculpture.\n\nLater years (1900\u20131917)\n\nBy 1900, Rodin's artistic reputation was entrenched. Gaining exposure from a pavilion of his artwork set up near the 1900 World's Fair (Exposition Universelle) in Paris, he received requests to make busts of prominent people internationally, while his assistants at the atelier produced duplicates of his works. His income from portrait commissions alone totaled probably 200,000 francs a year. As Rodin's fame grew, he attracted many followers, including the German poet Rainer Maria Rilke, and authors Octave Mirbeau, Joris-Karl Huysmans, and Oscar Wilde.\n\nRilke stayed with Rodin in 1905 and 1906, and did administrative work for him; he would later write a laudatory monograph on the sculptor. Rodin and Beuret's modest country estate in Meudon, purchased in 1897, was a host to such guests as King Edward, dancer Isadora Duncan, and harpsichordist Wanda Landowska. A British journalist who visited the property noted in 1902 that in its complete isolation, there was \"a striking analogy between its situation and the personality of the man who lives in it\". Rodin moved to the city in 1908, renting the main floor of the H\u00f4tel Biron, an 18th-century townhouse. He left Beuret in Meudon, and began an affair with the American-born Duchesse de Choiseul. From 1910, he mentored the Russian sculptor, Moissey Kogan.\n\nUnited States\n\nWhile Rodin was beginning to be accepted in France by the time of The Burghers of Calais, he had not yet conquered the American market. Because of his technique and the frankness of some of his work, he did not have an easy time selling his work to American industrialists. However, he came to know Sarah Tyson Hallowell (1846\u20131924), a curator from Chicago who visited Paris to arrange exhibitions at the large Interstate Expositions of the 1870s and 1880s. Hallowell was not only a curator but an adviser and a facilitator who was trusted by a number of prominent American collectors to suggest works for their collections, the most prominent of these being the Chicago hotelier Potter Palmer and his wife, Bertha Palmer (1849\u20131918).\n\nThe next opportunity for Rodin in America was the 1893 Chicago World's Fair. Hallowell wanted to help promote Rodin's work and he suggested a solo exhibition, which she wrote him was beaucoup moins beau que l'original but impossible, outside the rules. Instead, she suggested he send a number of works for her loan exhibition of French art from American collections and she told him she would list them as being part of an American collection. Rodin sent Hallowell three works, Cupid and Psyche, Sphinx and Andromeda. All nudes, these works provoked great controversy and were ultimately hidden behind a drape with special permission given for viewers to see them.Bust of Dalou and Burgher of Calais were on display in the official French pavilion at the fair and so between the works that were on display and those that were not, he was noticed. However, the works he gave Hallowell to sell found no takers, but she soon brought the controversial Quaker-born financier Charles Yerkes (1837\u20131905) into the fold and he purchased two large marbles for his Chicago manse; Yerkes was likely the first American to own a Rodin sculpture.\n\nOther collectors soon followed including the tastemaking Potter Palmers of Chicago and Isabella Stewart Gardner (1840\u20131924) of Boston, all arranged by Sarah Hallowell. In appreciation for her efforts at unlocking the American market, Rodin eventually presented Hallowell with a bronze, a marble and a terra cotta. When Hallowell moved to Paris in 1893, she and Rodin continued their warm friendship and correspondence, which lasted to the end of the sculptor's life. After Hallowell's death, her niece, the painter Harriet Hallowell, inherited the Rodins  and after her death, the American heirs could not manage to match their value in order to export them, so they became the property of the French state.\n\nGreat Britain\nAfter the start of the 20th century, Rodin was a regular visitor to Great Britain, where he developed a loyal following by the beginning of the First World War. He first visited England in 1881, where his friend, the artist Alphonse Legros, had introduced him to the poet William Ernest Henley. With his personal connections and enthusiasm for Rodin's art, Henley was most responsible for Rodin's reception in Britain. (Rodin later returned the favor by sculpting a bust of Henley that was used as the frontispiece to Henley's collected works and, after his death, on his monument in London.)\n\nThrough Henley, Rodin met Robert Louis Stevenson and Robert Browning, in whom he found further support. Encouraged by the enthusiasm of British artists, students, and high society for his art, Rodin donated a significant selection of his works to the nation in 1914.\n\nAfter the revitalization of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Beaux-Arts in 1890, Rodin served as the body's vice-president. In 1903, Rodin was elected president of the International Society of Painters, Sculptors, and Engravers. He replaced its former president, James Abbott McNeill Whistler, upon Whistler's death. His election to the prestigious position was largely due to the efforts of Albert Ludovici, father of English philosopher Anthony Ludovici, who was private secretary to Rodin for several months in 1906, but the two men parted company after Christmas, \"to their mutual relief.\"\n\nDuring his later creative years, Rodin's work turned increasingly toward the female form, and themes of more overt masculinity and femininity. He concentrated on small dance studies, and produced numerous erotic drawings, sketched in a loose way, without taking his pencil from the paper or his eyes from the model. Rodin met American dancer Isadora Duncan in 1900, attempted to seduce her, and the next year sketched studies of her and her students. In July 1906, Rodin was also enchanted by dancers from the Royal Ballet of Cambodia, and produced some of his most famous drawings from the experience.\n\nFifty-three years into their relationship, Rodin married Rose Beuret. They married on 29 January 1917, and Beuret died two weeks later, on 16 February. Rodin was ill that year; in January, he suffered weakness from influenza, and on 16 November his physician announced that \"congestion of the lungs has caused great weakness. The patient's condition is grave.\" Rodin died the next day, age 77, at his villa in Meudon, \u00cele-de-France, on the outskirts of Paris.\n\nA cast of The Thinker was placed next to his tomb in Meudon; it was Rodin's wish that the figure served as his headstone and epitaph. In 1923, Marcell Tirel, Rodin's secretary, published a book alleging that Rodin's death was largely due to cold, and the fact that he had no heat at Meudon. Rodin requested permission to stay in the Hotel Biron, a museum of his works, but the director of the museum refused to let him stay there.\n\nLegacy\nRodin willed to the French state his studio and the right to make casts from his plasters. Because he encouraged the edition of his sculpted work, Rodin's sculptures are represented in many public and private collections. The Mus\u00e9e Rodin was founded in 1916 and opened in 1919 at the H\u00f4tel Biron, where Rodin had lived, and it holds the largest Rodin collection, with more than 6,000 sculptures and 7,000 works on paper. The French order L\u00e9gion d'honneur made him a Commander, and he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Oxford.\n\nDuring his lifetime, Rodin was compared to Michelangelo, and was widely recognized as the greatest artist of the era. In the three decades following his death, his popularity waned with changing aesthetic values. Since the 1950s, Rodin's reputation has re-ascended; he is recognized as the most important sculptor of the modern era, and has been the subject of much scholarly work. The sense of incompletion offered by some of his sculpture, such as The Walking Man, influenced the increasingly abstract sculptural forms of the 20th century.\n\nRodin restored an ancient role of sculpture\u00a0\u2013 to capture the physical and intellectual force of the human subject\u00a0\u2013 and he freed sculpture from the repetition of traditional patterns, providing the foundation for greater experimentation in the 20th century. His popularity is ascribed to his emotion-laden representations of ordinary men and women\u00a0\u2013 to his ability to find the beauty and pathos in the human animal. His most popular works, such as The Kiss and The Thinker, are widely used outside the fine arts as symbols of human emotion and character. To honor Rodin's artistic legacy, the Google search engine homepage displayed a Google Doodle featuring The Thinker to celebrate his 172nd birthday on 12 November 2012.\n\nRodin had enormous artistic influence. A whole generation of sculptors studied in his workshop. These include Gutzon Borglum, Antoine Bourdelle, Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i, Camille Claudel, Charles Despiau, Malvina Hoffman, Carl Milles, Fran\u00e7ois Pompon, Rodo, Gustav Vigeland, Clara Westhoff and Margaret Winser, even though Brancusi later rejected his legacy. Rodin also promoted the work of other sculptors, including Aristide Maillol and Ivan Me\u0161trovi\u0107 whom Rodin once called \"the greatest phenomenon amongst sculptors.\" Other sculptors whose work has been described as owing to Rodin include Joseph Csaky, Alexander Archipenko, Joseph Bernard, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, Georg Kolbe, Wilhelm Lehmbruck, Jacques Lipchitz, Pablo Picasso, Adolfo Wildt, and Ossip Zadkine. Henry Moore acknowledged Rodin's seminal influence on his work.\n\nSeveral films have been made featuring Rodin as a prominent character or presence. These include Camille Claudel, a 1988 film in which G\u00e9rard Depardieu portrays Rodin, Camille Claudel 1915 from 2013, and Rodin, a 2017 film starring Vincent Lindon as Rodin. Furthermore, the Rodin Studios artists' cooperative housing in New York City, completed in 1917 to designs by Cass Gilbert, was named after Rodin.\n\nForgeries\nThe relative ease of making reproductions has also encouraged many forgeries: a survey of expert opinion placed Rodin in the top ten most-faked artists. Rodin fought against forgeries of his works as early as 1901, and since his death, many cases of organized, large-scale forgeries have been revealed. A massive forgery was discovered by French authorities in the early 1990s and led to the conviction of art dealer Guy Hain.\n\nTo deal with the complexity of bronze reproduction, France has promulgated several laws since 1956 which limit reproduction to twelve casts\u00a0\u2013 the maximum number that can be made from an artist's plasters and still be considered his work. As a result of this limit, The Burghers of Calais, for example, is found in fourteen cities.\n\nIn the market for sculpture, plagued by fakes, the value of a piece increases significantly when its provenance can be established. A Rodin work with a verified history sold for US$4.8\u00a0million in 1999, and Rodin's bronze \u00c8ve, grand modele\u00a0\u2013 version sans rocher sold for $18.9\u00a0million at a 2008 Christie's auction in New York. Art critics concerned about authenticity have argued that taking a cast does not equal reproducing a Rodin sculpture\u00a0\u2013 especially given the importance of surface treatment in Rodin's work.\n\nA number of drawings previously attributed to Rodin are now known to have been forged by Ernest Durig.\n\n Citations \n\n General sources \n\n (Online Essay)\n\nFurther reading\n\n \n Corbett, Rachel (2016).

His works were expressive and full of emotion, often depicting the human body in a raw, sensual way. Rodin began his training in the decorative arts at the age of 14, and later attended the \u00c9cole des Arts D\u00e9coratifs and the \u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris. After initially struggling to gain recognition for his work, Rodin gained widespread acclaim for his sculptures, including The Thinker and The Kiss. Rodin's style was heavily influenced by the works of Michelangelo and Gothic art, but he also drew inspiration from the naturalism of the human form. His sculptures often featured rough surfaces, emphasizing the idea that beauty is found in imperfection. Despite criticism from more traditional art circles, Rodin continued to challenge traditional conventions in his works, and his influence can be seen in the works of numerous modern sculptors, including Pablo Picasso and Henry Moore. Today, Rodin's works can be found in museums and public spaces around the world, including the Mus\u00e9e Rodin in Paris, the Rodin Museum in Philadelphia, and the Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Art.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Spiros Vondas\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Spiros \"Vondas\" Vondopoulos (Greek:  \u03a3\u03c0\u03cd\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u0392\u03bf\u03bd\u03b4\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2) is a fictional character on the HBO drama The Wire played by actor Paul Ben-Victor and the secondary antagonist in season 2.\n\nBiography\nVondas is The Greek's second-in-command and acts as a buffer between The Greek and his illegal activities, using a small cafe as his base of operations. Vondas tells Nick Sobotka that he has \"many names, many passports.\" Vondas' actual name and nationality are unknown; his main alias is Greek in origin, but he laughs to his superior that his name is not really his name. The name Spiros Vondopoulos is one of a range of identities that he has available to him, for example, he holds Hungarian and Croatian passports, but it is unclear if he is really a citizen of these countries. He is later shown destroying his Hungarian passport during a meal with The Greek. Vondas' Hungarian identity is Janos Kovats from Budapest, and his Croatian identity is Kirko Skaddeng, who is ostensibly a medical assistant from Osijek.\n\nVondas is almost always seen wearing a newsboy cap and has a strong fashion sense, as when Bunk Moreland observes that Vondas is wearing a Joseph Abboud blazer in the Season 2 episode \"Bad Dreams\".\n\nSeason 2\nVondas manages all aspects of the Greek's illicit shipping business but keeps a low, surveillance-conscious profile. He is Frank Sobotka's point of contact for his smuggling with The Greek. Vondas is even-tempered and patient, and often soothes the increasingly angry and frightened Sobotka as the Baltimore police began a serious investigation into Sobotka's union. Vondas also handles much less savory tasks: e.g., when a sailor in the Greek's employ, Sam, murdered fourteen girls meant for work as prostitutes, Vondas killed the man after the Greek interrogated him.\n\nVondas manages the Greek's drug dealing through their Israeli lieutenant Eton Ben-Eleazer. Vondas' own personnel involved in the smuggling operation include driver and enforcer Sergei \"Serge\" Malatov and organization fence George \"Double G\" Glekas.\n\nVondas often meets with Nick Sobotka, who frequently serves as Frank's go-between, and Vondas takes an almost paternal interest in the younger man. Impressed with Nick's intelligence, Vondas gave him the task of stealing a shipment of chemicals. Vondas also intervenes in a dispute over a debt between Nick's cousin Ziggy Sobotka and a drug dealer supplied by the Greek, Cheese Wagstaff. Despite a personal dislike for Ziggy, Vondas orders Sergei to argue Ziggy's case to Proposition Joe, Cheese's uncle and superior. Vondas' distrust of Ziggy proves correct when Ziggy kills Glekas in an argument over payment for stolen cars. Ziggy is arrested soon afterward, and Vondas distances the murder from the rest of the operation by removing all evidence of the business from the warehouse.\n\nWhen Lieutenant Daniels's port detail begins investigating the Greek's activity, Frank Sobotka realizes what is happening and tips Vondas. During the finale, the investigation detail finally gets a photo of Spiros meeting with his drug lieutenant Eton on the Baltimore waterfront. The detail then surveils Vondas' home and follows him to meetings at hotel rooms and the diner where he meets with associates.\n\nThe Greek orders Vondas to shut down the smuggling operation temporarily and replace all of his personnel's telephones. The Greek also withdraws from their meeting place at the cafe and begins meeting Vondas in hotel rooms.\n\nWhen the detail begins rounding up members of the Greek's smuggling ring, they hold off on Vondas, hoping he can lead them to the Greek. When Sobotka is arrested, Vondas suggests that they could broker his loyalty by having a witness against Ziggy change his story. Vondas puts the proposition to Frank through Nick. Frank has already agreed to testify against the Greek's crew but decides to meet with them for Ziggy's sake. The Greek learns of Frank's agreement through his inside man at the FBI, agent Koutris, and has Vondas murder Frank.\n\nFollowing the murder, the Greek and Vondas leave the country; Vondas uses a fake Croatian passport with the alias Kirko Skaddeng. Before Vondas leaves, he meets with Proposition Joe to assure him that the Greek's operation will continue to supply him, using new personnel, after a short break to avoid the investigation.\n\nSeason 4\nAfter Omar Little's team steals a shipment from the Greek to Proposition Joe's New Day Co-Op, Joe sets up a meeting with Vondas and Marlo Stanfield in order to assuage Marlo's suspicions that Joe had set him up in order to make him pay twice for the same shipment. It is thus revealed that Vondas had returned to Baltimore some time after the Major Crimes investigation of the docks had ended, and that Vondas had resumed his working relationship with Proposition Joe. While Marlo is satisfied with Vondas' explanation, he places a tail on him in order to learn more about Vondas' role in importing the drugs into Baltimore.\n\nSeason 5\nOnce the Major Crimes investigation into his organization is shut down, Marlo Stanfield feels secure enough in making a move to establish a direct relationship with Vondas and the Greeks. He researches the port case and discovers that former Greek soldier Sergei Malatov is incarcerated at Jessup. After paying prison gang leader Avon Barksdale to gain access to Sergei, Marlo uses Sergei to locate the Greeks' diner headquarters and drops off a large sum of money in order to persuade Vondas to grant him a meeting. Vondas is displeased that Marlo has brought him dirty money, from the street, and insists that all business should continue to go through Joe, then sends Marlo on his way. Marlo quickly has Joe clean his cash, and he drops off the fresh money at the diner, telling Vondas' man that he didn't mean for there to be any misunderstanding.\n\nMarlo once again meets with Vondas and attempts to sell himself as an insurance policy for the Greeks, implying that if anything were to happen to Proposition Joe, they would need another agent they could do business with. While Vondas believes all that matters is that the Greeks already have a secure relationship with someone they trust, The Greek states that Marlo makes a valid point that it is wise to have an insurance policy in volatile times, implicitly telling Marlo that if he moves on Joe, they will not stop him. After Marlo leaves, Vondas and the Greek seem resigned to Joe's demise and to initiating a new business relationship with Marlo, believing that Joe's time has come, and that Marlo's tenacity and ambition will not allow him to accept the Greeks' rejection of his business overtures.\n\nAfter Marlo has Proposition Joe murdered, he receives Vondas' blessing to be Joe's replacement as agent between Vondas' drug shipments and the New Day Co-op's drug distribution activities.\n\nLater, Marlo's first re-supply with the Greeks is busted by the Major Crimes Unit, and as part of a deal with the State's Attorney's office, Marlo is forced to retire from his life of crime. To set himself up for life, Marlo sells the connection to the Greeks to whoever can pay him 10 million dollars. In the series finale, Vondas is seen meeting with Fat Face Rick and Slim Charles at Little Johnny's Diner. They are discussing the new business arrangement, while The Greek quietly listens in the background.\n\nReferences\n\nThe Wire characters\nFictional career criminals\nFictional murderers\nTelevision characters introduced in 2003\nFictional smugglers\nDrug dealers of The Wire\nFictional henchmen\nShipyard associates of The Wire\nFictional smokers\nFictional underbosses\nMale characters in television", "machine_text": "Spiros Vondas is a fictional character from the popular television series The Wire, which premiered on HBO in 2002 and concluded in 2008. The character is portrayed by actor Paul Ben-Victor and appears in a total of 16 episodes throughout the show's five seasons. Vondas is a Greek immigrant and a major player in the Baltimore drug trade. He is the right-hand man of The Greek, a mysterious and elusive figure who operates as a liaison between the American drug dealers and their overseas suppliers. Vondas is known for his calm demeanor and calculated approach to business, making him a valuable asset to The Greek. Throughout the series, Vondas plays a key role in several major plotlines. He is heavily involved in the drug-smuggling operation that brings heroin into Baltimore from Europe, and he is often seen working closely with other key players in the city's criminal underworld, such as Stringer Bell and Marlo Stanfield. Despite his involvement in illegal activities, Vondas is shown to have a strong sense of integrity and loyalty. He is fiercely protective of The Greek and is willing to go to great lengths to ensure that his boss's interests are protected. At the same time, however, Vondas is not afraid to take matters into his own hands when necessary, demonstrating a willingness to use violence when it serves his needs. Overall, Spiros Vondas is a complex and intriguing character who adds an important layer of nuance and depth to the already rich tapestry of The Wire. His portrayal by Paul Ben-Victor is widely regarded as one of the show's standout performances, and his contributions to the story have helped to make The Wire one of the most beloved and critically acclaimed television dramas of all time.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 7017870}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"National Museum of Contemporary Art, Athens\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The National Museum of Contemporary Art (EMST \u0395\u03b8\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u039c\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b5\u03af\u03bf \u03a3\u03cd\u03b3\u03c7\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 \u03a4\u03ad\u03c7\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 (\u0395\u039c\u03a3\u03a4)), established in October 2000, is the sole national institution focused only on collecting and exhibiting contemporary Greek and international art in Athens. Anna Kafetsi, Ph.D in Aesthetics- Art History and former curator for 17 years of the 20th century collection at the National Gallery of Athens, was appointed founding director of EMST.\n\nHistory\nEMST first operated, from 2000 to September 2003, on the ground floor of approximately 1,800 square meters, of the old Fix brewery, an example of post-war industrial architecture designed by Takis Zenetos. It is located in close proximity to the center of Athens as well as the archaeological sites of the city, including the Acropolis and the Acropolis Museum. As of 2020, the restoration of the building is in progress in order to create state-of-the-art facilities for the permanent collection, periodic exhibitions, educational programs, and workshops. After an international architectural competition was announced, the architectural office which won the first prize and will realize the renovation of the Fix building are 3SK Stylianidis Architects in collaboration with Ioannis Mouzakis and associates architects LTD \u2013 studies of technical works Pan. Babilis and associates, and INSTA.\n\nUntil the return of the museum to the Fix building, EMST will continue its exhibitions program in the spaces of the Athens Conservatory, one of the most prestigious cultural institutions and finest buildings of architecture in the capital. By 2020, the Greek government spent 40 million euros on the museum, with the Stavros Niarchos Foundation giving a further 3 million euros in the final push towards completion. In the meantime, the delays in the museum's opening cost EMST a 3.3 million dollars subsidy from the European Union. Ownership of the Fix building was transferred from the subway authority Attica Metro, which owned the former brewery since the 1990s, to the museum foundation.\n\nCollections\nPivotal aspect of the EMST\u2019s artistic policy is the enhancement and enrichment of its permanent collections with works from Greek and international artists. There are two main axons according to which the collections are structured: a historic one, dating from the second half of the 20th century, and a contemporary one.\n\nThe museum is developing its permanent collections through purchasing works of art as well as soliciting donations. EMST aims at developing, within the next few years, a core collection of works representative of the basic directions of contemporary art.\n\nAmong the most important acquisitions are works by Ilya Kabakov, Stephen Antonakos, Gary Hill, Nan Goldin, Vadim Zakharov, Gillian Wearing, Ann Sofi Siden, Vlassis Caniaris, Nikos Kessanlis, Eleni Mylonas, Dimitris Alithinos, Nikos Navridis, Joel Sanders, Allan Sekula, Costas Tsoclis, George Hadjimichalis, Chryssa, Yiannis Psychopedis, Andreas Angelidakis, Lewis.Tsurumaki.Lewis and Tessera.\n\nA rich collection of video art has also been built. Among the most prominent artists are: Bill Viola, Bruce Nauman, Nam June Paik,  Mona Hatoum, Vito Acconci, Dan Graham,  Robert Wilson, Tony Oursler, Marina Abramovi\u0107 & Ulay, Eleni Mylonas, Chris Burden, Lynda Benglis,  Sadie Benning, Sophie Calle & Gregory Shephard, Carolee Schneemann, Martha Rosler, Dara Birnbaum, Walid Ra\u2019ad/The Atlas Group and Jayce Salloum.\n\nExhibitions\nWithin the framework of the exhibition policy of EMST, series of periodical exhibitions of open and explorative character are presented, on issues, investigations, and quests of international contemporary art, individual works commissioned by the Museum, mid-career retrospectives of contemporary artists, and historical retrospectives on the fields of painting, installations, photography, video, new media, and \"experimental\" architecture. Until the Museum building will have been completed and will be able to open its doors to the public, the permanent collections (both historical and contemporary) are presented in periodical exhibitions with selections of thematic and conceptual nuclei or artistic tendencies.\n\nEducational Programs\nWithin the framework of the educational policy of EMST educational programs for school groups and families, children workshops, tours for adults, and educators' seminars are realized, aiming at contributing to the discovery of and familiarization with contemporary art, Greek and international, of all age audiences.\n\nResearch\nAside from the permanent collection, periodic exhibitions and educational programming, the museum directs its efforts toward establishing an important infrastructure for research and artistic creation in its premises. Within this framework, the National Museum of Contemporary Art will establish and organize a center for the production of audiovisual works of art as well as a center of digital documentation of contemporary art. Both centers will be developed with the support of the Ministry of Culture and the funding programs \u201cCulture\u201d and \u201cInformation Society\u201d of the European Union.\n\nPublications\nThe EMST editorial program includes bilingual (in Greek and English) exhibition catalogs, which host theoretical and critical essays, as well as interdisciplinary interpretational approaches bu sociologists, anthropologists, philosophers, e.a. Special educational booklets for Primary and Secondary ( High School and Lyceum) education, as well as editions with the Museum new Acquisitions. A series of editions of Critical Essays on contemporary art, as well as artists' monographs based on unpublished material of The Archives of Greek Artists is being prepared.\n\nLibrary and Archives\nThe Library of EMST includes a significant number of specialized editions and journals on the fields of History and Theory of Art, Museology and Conservation of art works as well as on the field of History of Philosophy, Anthropology, Architecture and Industrial Design, New Technologies and Multimedia and is constantly enriched in order to serve scientific research and writing as well as the induction of the staff, of the visitors/researchers and artists. Also, a project for the exchange of editions with institutions in Greece and abroad has already been initiated.\n\nGreek artists and galleries have granted to the museum archives related to contemporary Greek art, after an invitation by EMST. The archives are constituted by catalogues, books, exhibition invitations, audiovisual material, texts by artists, correspondence, critiques, reviews, reproductions of works and biographical data.\n\nThe donation of the archives of Bia Davou and Pandelis Xagoraris by their son Zafos Xagoraris is exceptionally significant. It contains more than 2.000 articles and manuscripts of the two artists, their correspondence between them and also with other fellow artists, correspondence with official Fine Arts institutions, such as the Chamber of Fine Arts and the Ministry of Culture, archival material of the DESMOS gallery, which played a leading role in the artistic scene of the '70s, archival material from the Association of Contemporary Art and Artists and more.\n\nSee also\n National Gallery (Athens)\n Municipal Gallery of Athens\n Benaki Museum, Athens\n State Museum of Contemporary Art, Thessaloniki\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\nEMST website\nEMST blog\nCity of Athens\nwww.athensinfoguide.com\n\nMuseums in Athens\nModern art museums in Greece\nArt museums established in 2000\n2000 establishments in Greece", "machine_text": "The National Museum of Contemporary Art, Athens (EMST) is a contemporary art museum located in Athens, Greece.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"List of Mass Effect characters\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Mass Effect series, a military science fiction media franchise developed by Canadian video game developer BioWare and owned by American publisher Electronic Arts, features an extensive cast of characters. It is primarily based on a series of third-person role-playing shooter video games which currently consists of four mainline instalments and two spin-off mobile games. The first three Mass Effect games takes place in the Milky Way Galaxy during the 22nd century and revolves around a space navy soldier named Commander Shepard. The fourth Mass Effect game is a standalone sequel to the original trilogy but set in a different galaxy, Andromeda, and focuses on the Andromeda Initiative and the Ryder family. The spin-off games, Mass Effect Galaxy and Mass Effect Infiltrator, feature different protagonists.\n\nThis article describes characters who appear in video games set in the  Mass Effect universe, which includes a diverse cast of alien, human and synthetic characters. This list describes only player characters, squad members, major antagonists, and other notable characters that appear in the games. Certain characters have names chosen by the player; these characters are designated the name they are addressed by in-game. The appearance and story arcs of certain characters in Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3 are conditional upon decisions from prior Mass Effect titles being carried over via an imported save file.\n\nPlayer characters\n\nCommander Shepard \n\nCommander Shepard is the central protagonist of the original Mass Effect trilogy of video games. On an assignment to investigate a besieged human colony, Shepard is affected by a Prothean artifact that grants them insight on the Reapers, making them the key entity to help protect the species of the Milky Way from being wiped out by the Reapers. Shepard is later named the first human Spectre by the Citadel Council, and given command of the SSV Normandy and its crew to complete their mission.\n\nThe character's given name, gender, background, and appearance are determined by the player on starting a new game, with both Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3 allowing the player to import saves from previous games to carry over that version of Shepard. Depending on the choice of gender, Shepard is voiced by either Mark Meer or Jennifer Hale. The default male version's face and body is based on the likeness of fashion model Mark Vanderloo.\n\nJeff \"Joker\" Moreau \n\nJeff Moreau, better known by his nickname \"Joker\", is the pilot of the Normandy. Joker is a skilled pilot who has osteogenesis imperfecta. His nickname alludes to his tendency to behave as a sarcastic foil to other individuals he interact with. In Mass Effect 2, Joker briefly becomes a playable character when the Collectors invade the Normandy to capture its crew in the absence of Shepard and the squad. He can develop a romantic relationship with EDI in Mass Effect 3 if encouraged.\n\nJoker is voiced by Seth Green.\n\nJacob Taylor\nJacob Taylor is the protagonist of Mass Effect Galaxy, a tie-in iOS game to Mass Effect 2. He is a former Systems Alliance soldier who is recruited by Miranda Lawson in Galaxy to investigate a conspiracy involving batarian terrorists. Jacob is encountered in Mass Effect 2 as an official member of Cerberus and Shepard's starting squad member, as well as a potential romantic option for a female Shepard. Unless the player imports a Mass Effect 2 saved game where Jacob does not survive the suicide mission, in Mass Effect 3 he returns as a supporting character who has defected from Cerberus, and attempts to protect other Cerberus defectors from reprisals by their former employer.\n\nThe iconic look of all Cerberus clothing in the series is derived from the designs for Jacob's armor and clothing; some involved fully armored looks, while others had only cloth, or a mix of cloth and armor. For airless or toxic environments, Jacob wears a small breather device, which allows for more facial expressivity. According to a former BioWare employee, Jacob was originally meant to be a bisexual romance option, and that animation work for romance scenes with Commander Shepard of both genders, \"matching shot-for-shot from Brokeback Mountain\", was completed prior to intervention from management requesting that the same sex romantic content be removed, blaming backlash from news outlets like Fox News in response to the previous game.\n\nJacob Taylor is voiced by Adam Lazarre-White.\n\nChris Thursten from PC Gamer called Jacob \"the worst companion\" and the culmination of his romance arc \"the worst moment in Mass Effect\".\n\nRandall Ezno\nRandall Ezno is the protagonist of Mass Effect Infiltrator, a third-person shooter tie-in video game to Mass Effect 3 developed for mobile devices. He is a cybernetically modified Cerberus operative who discovers that his employer is up to something nefarious, goes rogue and embarks on a mission to save his friend from Cerberus.\n\nRandall is voiced by Jay Anthony Franke.\n\nPathfinder Ryder\nPathfinder Ryder is the main protagonist of Mass Effect: Andromeda, the fourth mainline installment of the Mass Effect series, and the child of Alec Ryder. Their twin sibling is Sara or Scott Ryder, depending on the player's chosen gender. The player can change their character's first name, but if the default names of Sara or Scott are kept, NPCs will occasionally refer to the character's first name in voiced dialogue.\n\nThe Ryder siblings are cryogenically frozen and dispatched alongside their father and tens of thousands of other colonists on a 600-year journey to the Andromeda galaxy, departing before the events of Mass Effect 3. The ark carrying the humans, the Hyperion, arrives at the wrong drop point, far from the forward command centre of the Andromeda Initiative, the Nexus, and cut off from contact with both it and the other arks. The player-controlled Ryder later succeeds their father as the Hyperion's Pathfinder, and is tasked with leading their crew on the command ship The Tempest, successfully settling the Heleus Cluster, and improving life aboard the Nexus, a galactic hub for the colonizer races from the Milky Way.\n\nScott and Sara Ryder are voiced by Tom Taylorson and Fryda Wolff, respectively.\n\nAndromeda was known for its technical issues, particularly for the awkward facial animations of some of its characters; notably, the default face for Sara Ryder received negative reception from fans prior to  and after the game's launch, attracting comments such as \"It's a perfect representation of the uncanny valley\" and a \"robot-like model that had dead eyes syndrome\" prior to a patch fix released in early April 2017.\n\nSquad members\n\nOriginal trilogy\n\nKaidan Alenko \n\nKaidan Alenko is a human Alliance Navy officer with biotic powers, who serves aboard the SSV Normandy as Staff Lieutenant and head of the ship's Marine detail. In a late-game choice on the planet Virmire, the player must choose whether to save Ashley Williams or Kaidan; this choice leads to the other character's death. If Kaidan survives, he returns in a cameo in Mass Effect 2 and as a full squad member in 3, where he has been promoted to the rank of Major and commands the 1st Special Operations Biotic Company, a covert operations unit. He is later bestowed Spectre status by the council. He is a potential romance option for a female Shepard throughout the entire trilogy, and for a male Shepard only in Mass Effect 3.\n\nKaidan is voiced by Raphael Sbarge.\n\nAshley Williams \n\nAshley Williams is a human Alliance Marine, who becomes part of Shepard's squad during the first observed Reaper attack in the first Mass Effect. In a late-game choice on the planet Virmire, the player must choose whether to save Ashley or Kaidan Alenko; this choice leads to the other character's death. If Ashley is saved, she will return in a cameo appearance in Mass Effect 2 and as a member of Shepard's squad for Mass Effect 3, where she has attained the rank of Lieutenant Commander and commands an unspecified covert operations unit. She is later bestowed Spectre status by the council. She is a potential romance option for a male Shepard throughout the original trilogy.\n\nAshley Williams is voiced by Kimberly Brooks.\n\nGarrus Vakarian \n\nGarrus Vakarian is a male turian who serves as a squad mate in all three of the games. Garrus is initially a C-Sec officer who joins up with Shepard to escape from all the \"red tape\" in his job but becomes a vigilante under the alias Archangel on Omega in Mass Effect 2 before his squad is killed. Garrus is a potential romance option for a female Shepard in 2.  In Mass Effect 3, he leads a \"Reaper task force\" for the Turians, with the option to continue their relationship from 2 if he was Shepard's paramour. The character is also the star of the third issue of Mass Effect: Homeworlds. Garrus's blue-and-black armour colour scheme was kept consistent throughout the series, as was his visor, although grey was added in the third game to reflect his new rank.\n\nGarrus is voiced by Brandon Keener.\n\nUrdnot Wrex \n\nA famous bounty hunter and mercenary, Wrex is among the last of the Krogan Battle Masters. They are rare individuals who can combine biotic abilities with advanced weaponry and tactics. He joins the crew of the SSV Normandy in the first Mass Effect to hunt the rogue Spectre Saren, but is later drawn into a stand-off with Commander Shepard in Virmire when he discovers that Saren's scientists have uncovered a cure for the genophage. Depending on the outcome, he may return in later sequels and eventually become a leader of the krogan.\n\nWrex is voiced by Steven Barr.\n\nTali'Zorah \n\nTali'Zorah, initially known by her full name Tali'Zorah nar Rayya, is the first quarian character to appear in the series. She is a squad mate in each of the three games. While she is known as a genius in the field of mechanical engineering. as the daughter of Admiral Rael'Zorah there is much pressure for Tali to excel. In the first game, she is on her Pilgrimage, before handing Shepard incriminating evidence about Saren and joining their crew. In the second game, now Tali'Zorah Vas Neema, where she joins Shepard on a suicide mission to rescue human colonists from the Collectors, and she is a potential romance option for a male Shepard. If she survives the suicide mission, she will appear as a squad member in Mass Effect 3, with the option to continue their relationship from 2 if she was Shepard's paramour. If Shepard sides with the geth over the quarians during the latter's attempt to retake Rannoch, she will commit suicide after witnessing the annihilation of the quarian Migrant Fleet.\n\nTali is voiced by Ash Sroka, also credited as \"Liz Sroka\".\n\nLiara T'Soni \n\nLiara T'Soni is an asari scientist, that joins Shepard's squad in the first game and appears in 2 as a non-player character (available as a temporary squad member in Mass Effect 2: Lair of the Shadow Broker) and as a full squad member in 3. She is one of the experts on Prothean history and technology. Liara is a potential romance option for Shepard throughout the entire trilogy. Following Shepard's death in Mass Effect 2, Liara gradually became emotionally hardened, and began working as an information broker, eventually leading to the events of Lair of the Shadow Broker which conclude with her becoming the new Shadow Broker.\n\nLiara is voiced by Ali Hillis.\n\nMiranda Lawson \n\nMiranda Lawson is an officer of the pro-human group Cerberus, first appearing in Mass Effect Galaxy and then serving as a squad mate in Mass Effect 2. In addition to these, the character also makes an appearance in the Mass Effect: Redemption comic series and in Mass Effect 3 (provided the player does not import a save where she dies). She is revealed to have been genetically designed by her father to be perfect and ran away from home to join Cerberus. Lawson is leader of Cerberus' Lazarus Cell, tasked with reviving Commander Shepard. Aboard the Normandy SR-2, she is Shepard's second-in-command and Executive Officer, and files mission reports directly to the Illusive Man.\n\nMiranda Lawson is voiced by and modeled after actress Yvonne Strahovski.\n\nEDI\n\nEDI is an AI entity who first appears in Mass Effect 2 as the Normandy SR-2's artificial intelligence and speaks with an aurally feminine voice. Her name stands for \"Enhanced Defense Intelligence\", and is visually represented on the Normandy by a holographic blue sphere. For Mass Effect 3, the developers wanted to give EDI a body that is \"sexy, chrome, and robotic\", akin to the Maria character, also known as the Maschinenmensch, from Metropolis. EDI's facial and body design went through multiple iterations, which includes an eyeless visage, and partially completed 3-D models which differ from the EDI's appearance in terms of body shape, the split between solid and transparent surfaces, and finer points of her two-tone appearance. After some discussion about how robotic would the extent of her appearance be, the team decided that the body she would come to possess is an infiltration unit, which once had skin over its metal frame and is capable of the same facial effects as a living human being to avoid being easily spotted.\n\nMass Effect 2 establishes that EDI's highly advanced nature is a result of modifications achieved with technology salvaged from the Reaper Sovereign. She is initially \"shackled\" with programming which inhibits her decision making, until it was later removed by Joker. In Mass Effect 3, Shepard's team recovers a Cerberus infiltration unit named Eva to be analyzed after an incident at the Mars research station. EDI assists in doing so, and in the process, struggles with the synthetic entity and eventually seizes control of its platform in the process, allowing her to accompany Shepard as a squad mate on missions. Now possessing a physical body with humanlike characteristics, her relationship with Joker develops further, and, if Shepard supports the idea, the two may start a romantic relationship. She often asks Shepard about the context and nature of human behaviour so that she can better understand human psychology and, in a sense, taking on more human traits herself. During the Alliance raid on Cerberus Headquarters, a Cerberus report discovered in the base retroactively establishes EDI's original identity as a rogue VI which somehow achieved sentience and took over an Alliance training ground located on Earth's moon during an optional mission of the first Mass Effect game. If Shepard chooses to control the Reapers or the synthesis of all organic and synthetic life at the conclusion of the game, EDI will be present in the ending cutscene alongside Joker.\n\nEDI is voiced by Tricia Helfer.\n\nPC Gamer praised EDI's characterization, noting that she \"might have had some fine dialogue and ruminations on what it means to be human\". EDI is also included in PC Gamer's definitive list of the best squad mates around, citing her utility as a solid fighter and being an actual spaceship. GameRevolution included EDI in their list of \"Women Who Rock Modern Gaming\"; praise was focused on her unique contribution to the squad dynamic in Mass Effect 3 with her new body, her inexperience in interacting with humanity which often leads to humorous situations, as well as her integration into the game's main plot during the final act of the game. On the other hand, Wes Fenlon indicated in his articles written for PC Gamer and Gamesradar that he was disturbed by BioWare's decision to give EDI a sexy robot body, and involving the character in a romance subplot with Joker. Stacey Henley from TheGamer also disapproved of EDI's costume design in Mass Effect 3, and criticized the sexualization of the character's physical appearance as not only unnecessary, but also uncomfortable as it detracts from her role in Mass Effect 3s team dynamic, as well as her \"brilliant\" characterization which Henley summarized as \"engaging, philosophical, layered\".\n\nMordin Solus \n\nMordin Solus is a salarian scientist who possesses a hyperactive and eccentric personality, a rapid and stilted manner of speaking, and  a flawless autobiographical and eidetic memory which is a typical salarians trait. He is a key member in the science team that researched the remodification of the Krogan Genophage, an action that he initially considered the best possible solution to a once growing problem, as he believes in acting in the best interests of the galaxy.\n\nThe character returns in Mass Effect 3, providing he survives the suicide mission in Mass Effect 2; otherwise, another salarian scientist named Padok Wiks fulfills Mordin's role within the narrative. Mordin is encountered on the salarian homeworld, Sur'Kesh, when Shepard is sent there to aid in the evacuation of a fertile female krogan codenamed Eve, the only survivor of his student Maelon's experiments. If Maelon's research data was saved in the previous game, he uses it to aid in Eve's treatment and produce a viable cure for the Genophage.\n\nMordin Solus is voiced by Michael Beattie in Mass Effect 2, and by William Salyers in Mass Effect 3.\n\nJack \n\nJack, also known as Jacqueline Nought or \"Subject Zero\", is the powerful product of unethical Cerberus experiments to enhance human biotic ability, which molded her antisocial temperament. Shepard may recruit Jack from the prison facility that she is confined in to join the suicide mission against the Collectors, in exchange for files aboard the Normandy about the science facility where Cerberus scientists tortured and abused her. She is a potential romance option for a male Shepard in Mass Effect 2. Jack reappears in Mass Effect 3 if a save game is imported where she survives the events of the suicide mission, with the option to continue their relationship from 2 if she was Shepard's paramour.\n\nJack is voiced by Courtenay Taylor.\n\nGrunt\nGrunt is a tank-bred genetically engineered super-krogan that can be recruited as a squad member. Grunt's design is intended to be youthful but also tough, invoking the look of a linebacker with large shoulder pads and exposed muscular arms. Compared to Wrex who is a much older krogan, Grunt's crest is smaller and does not fully cover his entire skull due to his age. Early designs for Grunt's armor varied widely, which eventually settled into a polished and sleek look, almost like a \"show-room finish\" on a brand new car. A confrontation scene in Mass Effect 2 between Grunt and Mordin over the latter's role in strengthening the Genophage was planned but ultimately cut during development.\n\nInitially in Mass Effect 2, Shepard is meant to recruit Okeer, a krogan warlord and radical scientist who has been developing a small army of krogan to weather the Genophage. When Shepard arrives to recruit him, Okeer is working for the Blue Suns mercenary group, but was betrayed by the latter. Though Shepard and crew defeat the Blue Suns leader, it is too late to save Okeer, who leaves Shepard with a tank containing his \"legacy\", his \"perfect krogan\". If and when Shepard decides to awaken him, the krogan recalls Okeer's last words and chooses one of them, \"grunt\", as his name. While initially hostile towards Shepard, Grunt may be recruited as a squad mate. He comes to respect Shepard's leadership, partly because Shepard faces great battles and has powerful enemies. If Grunt becomes loyal, he declares Shepard his battlemaster. If the player imports a save game where Grunt survives the suicide mission in 2, he appears in Mass Effect 3 in a small role.\n\nGrunt is voiced by Steve Blum.\n\nGrunt showing Shepard his strength in Mass Effect 2 is considered to be one of the original trilogy's most iconic moments by Kotaku's Gergo Vas.PC Gamer staff noted that while there is not much to the character \"beyond punching things and talking about fighting\", dealing with Grunt could be a \"refreshing change from the philosophizing and soul-searching of the rest of the crew.\"\n\nThane Krios\n\nThane is a mysterious drell assassin who is terminally ill from a disease known as Kepral's Syndrome, which is exclusive to drell due to their physiology. While a coldblooded killer, Thane possesses a conscience that struggles against his own profession. Shepard may recruit him on the asari-dominated world of Ilium for the suicide mission in Mass Effect 2. At the time of his recruitment, Thane states he has nothing left to lose, and he hopes to right many wrongs he has found in the galaxy before his death. Thane Krios is a possible romantic interest for a female Shepard.\n\nThane returns in Mass Effect 3 provided he survived the suicide mission in Mass Effect 2. Thane may play a role in the narrative depending on the player's prior decisions, but will ultimately succumb to his wounds from Kai Leng if he plays a role in preventing the assassination of a Citadel councilor, or to Kepral's Syndrome.\n\nThane Krios is voiced by Keythe Farley.\n\nSamara\n\nSamara is an Asari Justicar, a member of a highly respected and feared ascetic order of mystic warriors. Samara is on a quest to track down her fugitive daughter Morinth, who is a biological deviant known as an Ardat-Yakshi. Shepard meets Samara on Illium, where she is found investigating the Eclipse mercenary group who smuggled her daughter off-world. Samara will join Shepard for the suicide mission at the conclusion of the investigation; if Shepard chooses to participate in her quest, a decision has to be made between siding with Samara or Morinth at the climax of the story arc. If the player imports a save game where Samara survives the events of Mass Effect 2, she returns in a small role in Mass Effect 3 where she is encountered by Shepard at an Ardat-Yakshi monastery; confronted by a duty to comply with the Justicar Code by executing her only living child, who is also Ardat-Yakshi like Morinth and forbidden from leaving an asari monastery, she will attempt to commit suicide unless Shepard stops her.\n\nSamara is voiced by Maggie Baird, while Rana McAnear provides her likeness.\n\nMorinth\nMorinth is the fugitive daughter of Samara. She is an Ardat-Yakshi, asari who are born with an inherited trait which kills their mates during sexual encounters by burning out their nervous systems. Morinth joins Shepard's squad in Mass Effect 2 if she is assisted with trapping and killing Samara. She will then disguise herself as her mother and takes up residence at Samara's quarters on board The Normandy, so that only Shepard knows of Samara's death. Shepard may choose to mate with Morinth, although it will result in his or her death. If the player imports a save game where Morinth is recruited and survives the events of Mass Effect 2, she will appear in Mass Effect 3 as an indoctrinated husk-like enemy type known as a banshee.\n\nMorinth is voiced by Natalia Cigliuti. Her face was modeled after Rana McAnear. Morinth originally had a different face and character model and could not pass as Samara, and that Shepard would have had to either disclose the truth about Samara's fate to the rest of the crew or lie to them. Unlike most other squadmates in Mass Effect who had more complete arcs, Morinth only has two full-fledged conversations with Shepard, which mainly deals with her backstory with Samara and her experiences growing up as an Ardat-Yakshi. Morinth's planned dialogue options were trimmed down due to scope reasons and time constraints encountered during development, and the team opted to give the character an appearance which is identical to Samara, instead of cutting her from the game completely.\n\nVideo game developer Brian Kindregan, who wrote Morinth for Mass Effect 2, described her as a free spirit, a character who decides her own destiny and flaunt society's rules even if others are harmed in the process. To explore the dark underside of sapient or sentient beings that Morinth is drawn to, the decision was made to shift her original role from the leader of an underground cult to a hedonistic sexual predator who prowls for victims at a nightclub on Omega space station. Inspired by nightclub scenes depicted in Blade and The Matrix, Kindregan wanted to convey the feeling of an \"alternative culture just underneath the surface of one, and one that represents hedonism but also a slightly scary, predatory feel.\" Kindregan emphasized that the mission was not intended to be social commentary on drugs and nightclubs, but rather the underlying concepts they represent in fiction, as nightclubs in his view represent \"unbridled human impulse and desire\" and material excess by privileged youth similar in spirit to the symbolism presented by the depiction of jungles and wild nature in Heart of Darkness.\"\n\nUnlike most other levels in Mass Effect 2, Morinth's nightclub scene does not involve any combat sequences; instead, it entirely revolves around a story-driven gameplay mechanic Kindregan called a \"puzzle conversation\". Kindregan said it is difficult to write and implement a puzzle conversation as the player is supposed to be able to intuit the correct answers by interpreting Morinth's facial expressions and body language, and that he had considered incorporating a \"safety valve\" at the beginning of the mission for the benefit for the player, which would have served as a foolproof way to acquire all the correct answers to the conversation and complete the mission. Kindregan credited the positive feedback for the mission to the success of the final product's narrative and design as well as his teamwork with senior level senior level designer Dusty Evermore.\n\nPC Gamer staff considers Morinth to be a poor replacement for her mother, \"the more interesting and conflicted justicar\". She is rated better as an antagonist instead, the \"cat-and-mouse game of catching Morinth\" being lauded as one of Mass Effect 2's most exciting moments. Andr\u00e1s Neltz from Kotaku commented that \"the sheer audacity of a scam this huge\u2014setting out to recruit a virtuous Asari Justicar, and coming back with her black widow of a daughter instead, passing her off as the real thing\u2014is truly amazing.\"\n\nLegion \n\nLegion is the name, inspired by the \"Gospel of Mark 5:9 \u2013 Exorcism of the Gerasene demoniac\", given to the gestalt intelligence hosted within a geth mobile unit eleven times more powerful than standard geth mobile platforms. Legion belongs to the true Geth Consensus, and is designed to operate outside of geth space and interact diplomatically with organic lifeforms. In contrast to other Geth, Legion is capable of independent thought, and demonstrates emotional attachment as they are particularly fascinated with Shepard.\n\nLegion is voiced by D. C. Douglas.\n\nZaeed Massani \nZaeed is a human bounty hunter who is integrated into Mass Effect 2 through the DLC pack Zaeed - The Price of Revenge and later as part of the Mass Effect Legendary Edition compilation. He holds the reputation as the galaxy's most feared bounty hunter and co-founder of the Blue Suns mercenary group. Unlike most other characters, Zaeed joins Shepard's squad as soon as he is spoken to, and only tells short stories when conversed with. For his loyalty mission, he asks that Shepard help his vendetta against the Blue Suns' other co-founder, Vido Santiago. If the player imports a save game where Zaeed survives the events of 2, Zaeed returns in Mass Effect 3 with a small role.\n\nOriginally cut from the base game due to budget and time constraints, the Zaeed - The Price of Revenge DLC allowed the character's writer Jay Turner to repurpose unused content and use the constraints as a core part of his character. As Zaeed's loyalty mission is the only opportunity for players to get to know him, Turner had to ensure that all aspects of the character, \"from his dialogue to the identity of the villain to the events along the way\" must speak to his personality and backstory. To establish a simple but compelling motive for him, Turner pitched Zaeed's loyalty mission as one based on revenge, with his personality shaped into that of a grizzled survivor who has endured all kinds of death-defying situations with the stories and scars to prove it. Turner intended Zaeed to be an exploration of the themes of PTSD and trauma, and also as a ruthless antithesis to the \"BioWare Paladin\" archetype who is willing to complete his mission at all costs. Zaeed initially had a mechanic leg and a dog companion during early concept stages. Head models for the character went through various iterations, which included scarring, tattoos with the Blue Suns insignia, and potential breathers inspired by hocket masks and welding helmets for intimidation purposes.\n\nZaeed is voiced by Robin Sachs.\n\nPC Gamer staff member Wes Fenlon calling Zaeed a \"less interesting retread of KotOR's Mandalorian Canderous Ordo\" and expressed doubt about his ineffectiveness as a squad mate.\n\nKasumi Goto \n\nKasumi is a human master thief who is integrated into Mass Effect 2 through the DLC pack, Kasumi \u2013 Stolen Memory and later as part of the Mass Effect Legendary Edition compilation. The character's core concept is \u201cthe best thief in the galaxy\u201d. Unlike other characters, Kasumi does not have a recruitment mission and joins Shepard's squad as soon as she is spoken to, only making brief remarks or observations when interacted with. For her loyalty mission, Kasumi requests Shepard's help in retrieving the memory box of her dead lover Keiji Okuda. Kasumi returns in Mass Effect 3 with a small role, provided a save game is imported where her eponymous DLC was played and she survives the suicide mission.\n\nOriginally cut from the base game, Kasumi allowed the character's writer Jay Turner the chance to provide a \"glimpse into a wild underground where there are art heists and Bond villains and respect among thieves\" in Mass Effect 2. Turner wrote Kasumi's personality to be \"irreverent and quirky and confident\", with the intention to position her as Shepard's \"best friend\" as opposed to being yet another female character who Shepard could romance or sleep with. Describing Kasumi as his favorite character, Turner thought of her as a cheerful change from the game's often serious and severe tone. Kasumi presented Turner with an opportunity to explore the series' tropes from a different angle as she comments on Shepard's world from the perspective of an outsider who is a master of her world, one which is unfamiliar to Shepard. Turner compared her to the Batman character, in that she is always prepared and composed for any given situation, in spite of her flighty or flippant demeanor. Kasumi's visual design drew inspiration from Middle Eastern culture; her outfit echoes that of a typical thief from the European Middle Ages, the hood in particular gives her a mysterious and stealthy look.\n\nKasumi Goto is voiced by Kym Hoy. Hoy noted that Kasumi's cultural background is specifically stated to be of Japanese descent, and that the casting call required a candidate who could carry the mystique of an elusive personality along with projecting a vaguely Asian-sounding accent. With the guidance of her voiceover directors, Hoy made necessary preparations to develop a blend of Japanese and British English accents for Kasumi's soft-spoken voice; as she wanted a little mystery surrounding where Kasumi is truly from, she was mindful about not making the accent overly modern-sounding and not too precise. Hoy credits her past experience in performing ethnic Asian characters as well as her classical theatre and singing training for her ability to perform Kasumi's accent at a consistent pace, and ensuring the character sounds natural in terms of timing and delivery without it becoming a caricature. Hoy noted that while BioWare had specifications about how they wanted the character to sound like, with \"1940s movie star sass\" being an ideal, they were also open to feedback and questions from her about the development of the character's personality.\n\nPC Gamer staff praised Kasumi as one of more visually interesting Mass Effect squad mates. IGN's Steven Hopper ranked Kasumi #9 in his list of best Mass Effect teammates.\n\nJames Vega\n\nLieutenant James Vega is a human Systems Alliance Marine and Shepard's squad member in Mass Effect 3. James is tasked to escort Shepard to an Alliance defense committee hearing, however the hearing is interrupted when the Reapers attack Earth. James and Ashley or Kaidan, depending on who survived Virmire, retrieve the Normandy SR-2 and pick Shepard up from Earth. James is the main focus of the  anime film, Mass Effect: Paragon Lost.\n\nJames Vega is voiced by Freddie Prinze, Jr. in all media.\n\nJavik\nJavik is the endling of the Prothean race, and is only available if the Mass Effect 3: From Ashes DLC is installed. His stasis pod is uncovered and opened by Commander Shepard and Liara T'Soni during his recruitment mission, who were investigating Cerberus activity on the human colony of Eden Prime. Flashbacks of Javik's memories happen during the mission which reveals insights on the Prothean's struggle against the Reapers. Javik reacted with shock that he had awaken after 50,000 years and everything he knew was gone, but agrees to join Shepard to stop the Reapers no matter the cost.\n\nThe Protheans were first depicted in the form of visually ambiguous statues on the planet Ilos in the first game, as at the time BioWare was unsure as to the extent of the role the Protheans would play over the course of the original trilogy. Javik's final design is based on the look of the Collectors from Mass Effect 2, particularly the shell shape of the head which is a signature feature of the Collectors, along with multiple pupils to the eyes and secondary nostrils to evoke a very alien feel. As the Protheans of his time were known for their highly advanced technological capabilities, Javik is intended to look more intelligent than a mindless Collector drone. Javik's armor, which is influenced by the aesthetics of samurai armor, is intended to be technologically advanced yet with an ancient feel, thematically appropriate for a being who had been placed in stasis for over 50,000 years.\n\nJavik is voiced by Ike Amadi.\n\nMass Effect: Andromeda\n\nCora Harper\nCora Harper is a human biotic commando and operations specialist in charge of the Pathfinder team's ground missions. She began a career in the Alliance military, before serving with an asari commando unit as part of a Council inter-species integration scheme. She is second-in-command of the human Pathfinder team and meant to be Alec Ryder's appointed successor as Pathfinder. Cora is a romance option for a male Pathfinder.\n\nCora is voiced by Jules de Jongh.\n\nLiam Kosta\nLiam Kosta is a human security and crisis response specialist for the Pathfinder team, and was \u201chand-picked\u201d by Alec Ryder due to his multidisciplinary skills. Liam is a romance option for a female Pathfinder.\n\nLiam is voiced by Gary Carr.\n\nVetra Nyx\nVetra Nyx is from the turian homeworld of Palaven and a well traveled drifter, who at some point \"drifted into the wrong crowd\". She has well honed street smarts and adaptability from years of working with smugglers and mercenaries, and is fiercely loyal once her trust is earned. Vetra is a romance option for a Pathfinder of either gender.\n \nVetra is voiced by Danielle Rayne.\n\nPelessaria \"Peebee\" B'Sayle\nPelessaria B'Sayle, better known by her nickname Peebee is a rogue-ish young academic from Port Lerama, capital of the planet Hyetiana, a hub for asari science and education. She has developed an obsessive interest in studying the Remnant, an umbrella term coined for technology, structures, and autonomous bots that have been sighted across the Heleus Cluster. She is considered to be an atypical member of asari culture, \u201cpathologically independent\u201d, and has little regard for rules or teamwork. She is rivals with Kalinda, another asari who competes with Peebee in her search for Remnant technology. Peebee is a romance option for a Pathfinder of either gender.\n\nPeebee is voiced by Christine Lakin.\n\nNakmor Drack\nNakmor Drack is a veteran krogan warrior who has well over 1,400 years of life experience as a soldier, mercenary, and occasional pirate in the Milky Way galaxy. He is vocal about the genophage and the Citadel community's treatment of his species. Unlike other members of the Nakmor clan, he is loyal to the Nexus, the seat of government and power for the Andromeda Initiative, and to his granddaughter, Nakmor Kesh. Drack's preferred weapon is a \"Ruzad\" shotgun, and his favorite ability is Blood Rage, which \"enhances his melee damage, damage resistance, and health regeneration\".\n\nDrack is voiced by Stanley Townsend.\n\nJaal Ama Darav\nJaal Ama Darav is a high-ranking member of the Angaran Resistance who are at war with the kett, and joins the Pathfinder's team as a liaison between the Andromeda Initiative and the resistance fighters. Jaal's preferred weapon is a sniper rifle. Jaal was initially a romance option for a female player character only, and was an early fan favorite among Andromeda's new cast of characters. A patch  for the game released in June 2017 made Jaal available as a potential romance option for a male player character.\n\nJaal is voiced by Nyasha Hatendi.\n\nMajor antagonists\n\nThe Reapers\n\nThe Reapers are a highly advanced machine race of synthetic-organic starships residing in dark space: the vast, mostly starless space between galaxies. They hibernate and remain dormant for a cycle of fifty thousand years, before returning to the Milky Way galaxy and harvest all sentient organic life. The Reapers and their various agents are the overarching antagonists of the original trilogy.\n\nSaren Arterius\nSaren Arterius is a turian Spectre, an elite operative who represented the Citadel Council and operated above the law, and one of the two main antagonists of the first Mass Effect game . Saren was originally designed as an older, weaker character who is a powerful biotic. Saren's head design went through several iterations: the team experimented with structure, scarring, and decorations. His final appearance is similar to other turians but with a distinctive crest, and a lack of tattoos unlike most of his kind. It was intended for the character to show signs of severe indoctrination, yet does not look like an obvious monstrosity and is still able to blend into society. The character's final design incorporates a mechanical arm and some visible cybernetic features to reflect Reaper indoctrination.\n\nHe first appears in the novel Mass Effect: Revelation, which takes place 18 years before to the events of Mass Effect and before he was indoctrinated and working with Sovereign. Saren later takes command of a dissident geth faction through the use of a Reaper known as Sovereign. With a machine army at his command, he uses them to both do his bidding and oppose Shepard across the story of the Mass Effect video game. Saren's main base is situated on the planet Virmire, where he is conducting experiments such as a cure for the Krogan Genophage to bolster his army. Throughout the course of the game, the Reaper slowly began to manipulate Saren through subtle subliminal messages into helping it bring back the Reapers. During the geth invasion of the Citadel, Saren uses the Prothean Conduit to gain access to the Citadel to allow Sovereign to activate the Citadel mass relay. The player can then either attempt to kill Saren or appeal to Saren to fight his indoctrination, which if successful will prompt him to commit suicide. Shepard later has to fight a revived and mutated Saren, who is possessed by Sovereign through his grafted cybernetics. Upon defeat of the Sovereign-manipulated Saren, Sovereign itself loses its defenses and is destroyed.\n\nIGN included the moment Saren commits suicide in their list of 13 Best Mass Effect Moments.\n\nSaren is voiced by Fred Tatasciore.\n\nMatriarch Benezia\nMatriarch Benezia is the mother of Liara T'Soni, and was a highly regarded spiritual leader among the asari until she was mind controlled by the Reaper Sovereign and forced to become Saren's second in command. Her appearance is intended to capture the beauty and mystical power of the asari, and also to associate her with Saren's malevolence through its darker and more enigmatic qualities. The design of her headdress references religious and royal clothing.\n\nIn Mass Effect Shepard travels to the planet Noveria and confronts Benezia, discovering that she has found and captured a surviving queen of the rachni. Benezia intends to use the rachni queen to breed an army of rachni to fight Saren's enemies. Although Benezia has a lucid moment during their fight, where she reveals the next phase of Saren's plans and warns Shepard about Sovereign's corrupting influence, Shepard has to fight her to the death after she completely succumbs to the indoctrination.\n\nMatriarch Benezia is voiced by Marina Sirtis.\n\nDonnel Udina\nDonnel Udina first appears in the original Mass Effect as the human ambassador based in the Citadel. Udina is depicted as self-serving politician who has an antagonistic relationship with Shepard and their mentor David Anderson throughout the original trilogy. By the events of Mass Effect 3, he is the representative for humanity in the Citadel Council, regardless of the player's choice in the ending of the first game. Later in 3, Udina allies with Cerberus to stage a coup in a desperate attempt to overthrow his fellow Councillors as part of his plan to prioritize the liberation of planet Earth from the Reapers, but he is killed when the coup fails.\n\nDonnell Udina is voiced by Bill Ratner.\n\nThe Thorian\nThe Thorian, also called Species 37, is an ancient sentient fungal creature tens of thousands of years old, with unique mind-controlling and telepathic abilities, the ability to create clone duplicates of a being it has absorbed, and a massive sensory network stretching over the surface of the planet Feros. It releases spores into the air that infect those who inhale them, and uses pain to control the behavior of its thralls. In Mass Effect, the Thorian encounters Shiala, an asari and former acolyte of Matriarch Benezia who had been absorbed by the Thorian, which used clone duplicates of her as an avatar to interact with Shepard's team. Shiala will be set free after the Thorian is killed, and she grants Shepard the Prothean cipher which enables the mental decryption of the mental message transmitted from the Prothean beacon. Shepard has the choice to either spare or execute her.\n\nCerberus \n\nCerberus, an anthropocentric group advocating militarism and a \"humanity-first\" supremacist agenda, appears as recurring antagonists in the series. Cerberus is founded and led by the Illusive Man, voiced by Martin Sheen. Cerberus forms an alliance with Commander Shepard against the human-abducting Collectors in Mass Effect 2, whereas in Mass Effect 3 they work against Shepard's attempts to destroy the Reapers, as the Illusive Man wishes to control them instead. The organization experienced numerous defections between the events of Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3, including operatives who specialize in close combat electric whips.\n\nMegan Logan from Inverse praised the depiction of Cerberus in the series as a villainous entity, and opined that \"nuanced complexity built upon an understandable motivation is what makes a compelling antagonist\".\n\nKai Leng\nKai Leng is a former lieutenant N7 marine and Cerberus assassin, who first appears in the novel Mass Effect: Retribution, as well as its subsequent sequels. Kai Leng is the Illusive Man's most trusted agent, who used him as his best infiltration and wet-work operative for over a decade, and appears in Mass Effect 3 as one of the game's main antagonists. He wears a coat similar to Thane's over a uniform with Cerberus colors, and his face and body is equipped with visible cybernetic implants to compensate for the injuries he sustained in Retribution courtesy of David Anderson. Early direction of Kai Leng's concept involve inhuman-looking metallic legs and hard armor as upgrades, which were streamlined during the later period of the development cycle of 3 into a stealthier appearance along with his hairstyle, coat length and visor type.\n\nIn Mass Effect 3 he was among the forces deployed during Udina's coup on the Citadel Council, and will succeed in assassinating the salarian councilor unless Thane Krios or Kirrahe are available in Mass Effect 3 to intervene. Kai Leng is next encountered on the asari homeworld Thessia, where he successfully claims an ancient Prothean-made VI from the asari on the Illusive Man's orders. Shepard's final encounter with Kai Leng is in the Illusive Man's observation deck on Cronos Station, the Cerberus headquarters. Despite his lethal skills, he is unable to overwhelm Shepard, and is wounded. He later retrieves his blade and makes a final attempt to kill the Commander from behind. At that moment, Shepard detects him and counters his attack, finishing him off with an omni-blade.\n\nKai Leng is voiced by Troy Baker.\n\nKai Leng's execution by Shepard is considered to be one of the original trilogy's most iconic moments by Kotaku's Gergo Vas, and one of the 13 best Mass Effect Moments by IGN.\n\nOleg Petrovsky\nOleg Petrovsky is a general of Cerberus' armed forces, who first appears in the comic Mass Effect: Invasion, where he seizes control of the Omega space station from Aria T'Loak using adjutants, a type of husk-like creature engineered by Cerberus through co-opting Reaper technology. He makes his first video game appearance as the main antagonist of the Mass Effect 3 DLC Omega.\n\nThe Collectors\nThe Collectors are mysterious aliens first mentioned in the 2008 novel Mass Effect: Ascension, who are known to trade hyper-advanced technology in exchange for living beings from various species. They were widely dismissed as myths within the Mass Effect universe, but are in fact the deformed versions of the original Prothean race. Prior to the events of Mass Effect 2, all known expeditions to investigate the Collectors failed, and no vessel that ventured to their space beyond Omega 4 Relay ever returned save those of the Collectors themselves. Led by a Collector General, a unique being who controls the rest of the Collectors from their base beyond the Omega Four mass relay, they collect humans by incapacitating them using flying insect-like \"seeker swarms\" to create a new Reaper on their masters' behest following Sovereign's defeat and destruction at the end of the first game. The Collectors are assisted by a variety of husk units made from Reaper technology, with some created from multiple husks strung together in a grotesque manner such as Scions who provide ranged fire support with their arm cannons, as well as large floating monstrosities called Praetorians. The Collectors' look is based on crabs and microscopic closeups of insect species like beetles and mosquitoes. The Collectors were initially envisioned as robed walking bipedal aliens for a dark, cultlike feel; as Collector soldier units had to fulfill in-game combat mechanic requirements, their design shifted to a more humanoid appearance, while the Collector General has multiple limbs that resemble arthropod legs.\n\nAndr\u00e1s Neltz from Kotaku consider the Collectors to be tragic figures, and \"a demonstration of what evil the Reapers are capable of; a twisted shadow of a once-proud race, forced to serve the ones who destroyed them.\"\n\nThe Shadow Broker\nThe Shadow Broker is the elusive and enigmatic head of an expansive organization which trades in data and information, always selling to the highest bidder. The Shadow Broker's identity is unknown to the general public and always operates through an agent. For the Shadow Broker's design, two disparate concepts were combined: that of the galaxy's greatest information broker whose suit evokes a mob boss look and is fully integrated into the galactic community, as well as that of an unfamiliar alien and a frighteningly inhuman challenge for Shepard. The Broker's final facial design, with his triangular mouth and multiple eyes, is unlike anything BioWare has done in the past, and custom work had to be done to animate his face properly as Mass Effect 2 digital-acting system could not handle the graphical stress.\n\nIn Mass Effect Tali wanted to trade evidence incriminating Saren to the Shadow Broker in exchange for a safe place to hide; the Broker sends a thug named Fist to deal with her, although he later dispatches Wrex to eliminate Fist, who had turned traitor. Other notable agents of the Broker include the volus financial adviser Barla Von, and Wilson, Miranda Lawson's assistant in the Lazarus Project who joins Shepard as a temporary squad mate on Lazarus Station in Mass Effect 2. Following the events of Mass Effect: Redemption, Liara pursues the Shadow Broker for revenge over her friend Feron's imprisonment and torture. In Mass Effect 2: Lair of the Shadow Broker, Liara survives an assassination attempt by an agent of the Broker, a rogue asari Spectre named Tela Vasir. She then travels to the Shadow Broker Base on the planet Hagalaz with Shepard, where they confront the Shadow Broker, who is revealed to be a member of a pre-spaceflight race called the yahg. They killed the Broker following a boss fight, and Liara succeeds him as the new Shadow Broker.\n\nShepard's meeting and confrontation with the Shadow Broker is considered to be one of the original trilogy's most iconic moments by Kotaku's Gergo Vas, and one of the 13 best Mass Effect Moments by IGN.\n\nDr. Amanda Kenson\nDr. Amanda Kenson is a human scientist known for her groundbreaking discoveries on the origins of the mass relays. She appears as a deep cover agent in the Mass Effect 2 DLC Arrival, and is saved from batarian captivity by Shepard on her friend Admiral Hackett's behest. She claims to have found evidence of an imminent Reaper invasion, revealing that her team have set a massive asteroid to collide into a mass relay located within the Bahak system in batarian space in order to slow the Reapers' arrival. After her entire team is revealed to have been indoctrinated by the Reapers, Shepard has to stop Dr. Kenson from interrupting the asteroid's course, which culminates in Dr. Kenson killing herself after detonating an explosive device. If the player imports a save where the Arrival DLC is completed, Shepard's action of facilitating the destruction of the Bahak system's mass relay in order to delay the Reapers' invasion resulted in the loss of over 300,000 batarian lives, which leads to their imprisonment and impending trial in the beginning of Mass Effect 3.\n\nMaya Brooks\nMaya Brooks is the alias of a former Cerberus operative who serves as the main antagonist of the story campaign of the Mass Effect 3 DLC Citadel; she initially presents herself to Shepard as a Systems Alliance staff analyst. She is also responsible for sabotaging Lazarus Station, which housed the Lazarus Project that brought Shepard back from the dead, in order to steal a dormant clone of Shepard. Her actions led to the sequence of events following Shepard's awakening from a coma in Mass Effect 2. She later appears in Mass Effect: Foundation, a 13-issue comic book series starring most of Shepard's squad mates in the original trilogy, which is framed as reconnaissance by Brooks as the point-of-view character.\n\nThe Kett\nThe kett are a hostile militaristic species with dense formations of bone growing externally as armor protrusions on their bodies. They serve as the main antagonists of Mass Effect Andromeda. The kett are led by the Archon, who is voiced by Robert Kazinsky.\n\nOther characters\n\nOriginal trilogy\n\nDavid Anderson\nCaptain David Edward Anderson is a protagonist of the novel Mass Effect: Revelation, an experienced N7 marine and Commander Shepard's mentor throughout the Mass Effect trilogy.

By the events of Mass Effect 3 he is promoted to the rank of Admiral, and joins Shepard as a temporary squad mate early in the game during the early stages of the Reaper invasion. He appears dressed for battle in fatigues that would not reflect his rank but also wouldn't look out of place in a battlefield.\n\nAnderson is voiced by Keith David.\n\nIGN included the Finale in Mass Effect 3, where Shepard shares an emotional scene with Anderson and the Illusive man, in their list of 13 Best Mass Effect Moments.\n\nKahlee Sanders\nKahlee Sanders is a protagonist of Mass Effect: Revelation and its sequels, Ascension, Retribution, and Deception She is cited as one of the most important characters in the series, and the main heroine of Mass Effect spin-off fiction.

Dr. Chakwas returns in Mass Effect 3, provided she survives the suicide mission in Mass Effect 2. She may be recruited back to the Normandy, or be convinced to stay at the Citadel and assist in the war effort.\n\nDr. Chakwas is voiced by Carolyn Seymour.\n\nRichard L. Jenkins\nCorporal Richard L. Jenkins is an Alliance Marine from the rural world of Eden Prime under the command of Captain Anderson, and a member of the SSV Normandy's crew.

He is based on the Leeroy Jenkins character.\n\nConrad Verner\nConrad Verner is a human fanatic who is obsessed with Commander Shepard. Andr\u00e1s Neltz from Kotaku notes that he is a \"crazy fan archetype taken to the next level\", and an example of a character whose personality and fate could be shaped by the player throughout the original trilogy depending on how their player character reacts to Verner's antics.\n\nKhalisah al-Jilani\nKhalisah bint sinan al-Jilani is a human reporter from Westerlund News. She appears in all three games as a reporter who employs a belligerent  line of questioning whenever she is granted an opportunity to interview Shepard.

Beth Elderkin of Gizmodo referred to the aforementioned running gag as the \"Al-Jilani Saga\" and one of her favorite moments.\n\nAdministrator Anoleis \nAdministrator Bel Anoleis manages Port Hanshan, the capital of the planet Noveria, in the first Mass Effect. In order to obtain a garage pass to leave the port, Shepard could either prove the salarian bureaucrat's corruption to an undercover investigator named Gianna Parasini, side with Anoleis and turn over all the evidence to him, or pit Anoleis and Parasini against each other which leads to both of their deaths. Andr\u00e1s Neltz from Kotaku noted that the mission dealing with Anoleis was one of the most complex ones in the first game, and it was an early example \"showing how differently the story can go depending on the player's decisions\".\n\nCaptain Kirrahe \nCaptain Kirrahe was the Salarian Special Tasks Group (STG) intelligence officer who uncovered Saren's facility on Virmire, and fights alongside Shepard's squad during the assault. Kirrahe's determination to destroy Saren's base, and thus the cure with it, causes a rift between Shepard and Wrex which may be resolved by the player in a number of ways. If he survives the battle, he will be promoted to Major and appears in Mass Effect 3 as an ally at various instances. Kirrahe's speech amidst a thunderstorm in Mass Effect is considered to be one of the original trilogy's most iconic moments by Kotaku's Gergo Vas.\n\nSteven Hackett\nAdmiral Steven Hackett is a high-ranking official of the Earth Systems Alliance Navy's Fifth Fleet. He first appears as a minor character in Mass Effect who commands the Systems Alliance reinforcements which arrive to assist in the defense during the attack on the Citadel by Sovereign and the geth. During the course of the battle, he will defer to Shepard's wishes to either save the Citadel Councillors aboard the asari dreadnought the Destiny Ascension, or press the attack on Sovereign's forces. After the battle, he is promoted to head of the Alliance Navy. By the events of Mass Effect 3, he leads the entire Alliance forces in their struggle against the Reaper invasion.\n\nHackett is voiced by Lance Henriksen.\n\nKelly Chambers\nKelly Chambers is Shepard's yeoman on the Normandy SR-2 in Mass Effect 2 whose primary role is administrative and clerical work. She keeps Commander Shepard notified of new e-mails and pass on meeting requests from Shepard's squad mates. In addition, Kelly utilizes her degree in psychology to provides counseling support and monitors the psychological state of Shepard and the crew. She is a romance option for a male or female Shepard, but does not grant the \"Paramour\" achievement. If she survives the suicide mission in Mass Effect 2, she will appear in Mass Effect 3. She informs Shepard that she is on the run from Cerberus, her former employers. Shepard may ask her to continue assisting with the war effort, or go into hiding.\n\nPatrick Lee from AV Club brought up Chambers' potential fate in Mass Effect 3 as an example where a Paragon-aligned Shepard is \"not a saintly warrior-poet whose every decision is ethically and practically airtight\".\n\nAria T'Loak\nAria T'Loak, also known as \"the Pirate Queen\", is an asari organized crime boss who serves as the de facto ruler of Omega Station, an important hub in the lawless Terminus Systems. She owns the Afterlife Club, which serves as the station's central hub. Her first chronological appearance is in Mass Effect: Incursion, an 8-page prequel comic to Mass Effect 2.

The Pathfinder may find themselves navigating the moral shades of grey the Mass Effect series is known for in their dealings with Jarun. He also appears in the tie-in novel to Andromeda, Mass Effect Andromeda: Nexus Uprising, where he is portrayed as the central character of the uprising led by former security chief Sloane Kelly at the Nexus.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Asensio Nebot\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Asensio Nebot, known as \"The Friar\" and born in Nules, Spain in 1779, was a guerrilla in the Kingdom of Valencia during the Peninsular War. His exploits during the Peninsular War are well documented but, as he worked as a secret agent after the end of the war, there are gaps in what is known about his life from 1815 onwards.\n\nPeninsular War\nAsensio Nebot was born in Nules in 1779. He entered the Monastery of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Rosario in Villarreal at a very early age to study to become a Franciscan friar. In 1809 the monastery was closed and Nebot joined the fight against the French after Napoleon's invasion of Spain in the Peninsular War. Nebot fought as a guerrilla and was known as El Fraile or Padre Nebot because of his Franciscan education. He assembled an army of 4,000 men with a cavalry of 500 and a rifle brigade, Tupper\u2019s Rifles, so called because the guns and money had been provided by Peter Charles Tupper, a wealthy British businessman who lived in Valencia. The Friar set up his headquarters at Vistabella del Maestrat, an inaccessible village in Castell\u00f3n. He harassed the French with ambushes and surprise attacks. He stopped their provisions and mail from reaching their destinations, destroyed their supplies and took possession of their horses and weapons.\n\nFrench forces under Louis-Gabriel Suchet took Valencia in 1812 and many Valencians accepted the occupation without protest. Nebot not only led his men in attacks on the French but also established factories where bullets were cast and weapons and harnesses were repaired, stores for the provisions he collected and workshops where uniforms were made. He was influenced by the Liberal brothers Vicente and Manuel Bertr\u00e1n de Lis and when the anti-feudal Spanish Constitution of 1812 was approved in C\u00e1diz he made sure that elections were held in all the towns that he controlled and that Liberals were elected. As well as skirmishes, he attacked French garrisons in Castell\u00f3n, Nules and Artana. He took his prisoners to Vistabella where they were locked in a jail under which there were more than 20 barrels of gunpowder in case there was an attempt to free them. In 1813 there were more than 500 French soldiers in this jail.\n\nMazzuchelli, the Governor of Valencia, offered a reward of 5,000 pesetas for the Friar alive and 4,000 for him dead. Nebot responded by offering two small coins for Mazzuchelli alive and one coin for his head. As well as killing French soldiers, he also executed Spaniards who collaborated with the French occupation. He attacked convoys that were taking Spanish prisoners to France and managed to release a good number of them. From his attacks he collected well over a hundred horses and very many weapons, including a cannon.\n\nAs his troops had not been able to capture Nebot, Suchet offered three criminals who had been condemned to death their liberty, 5,000 pesetas and employment if they would infiltrate Nebot's guerillas and then murder him. Tupper tried to warn the Friar but the three criminals confessed as soon as they reached Nebot and joined his brigade.\n\nOn 18 May 1813 Nebot took Morella but had to abandon it when the French army approached. On 14 July, Nebot entered Vinar\u00f2s and set up his headquarters at Benicarl\u00f3. On 20 July he attacked Morella again with 3,000 men, breached the city walls and forced the French to take refuge in the castle. They finally surrendered on 21 October. In December, according to some historians, he attacked the French garrison in Denia and forced them to surrender.\n\nRestoration of King Ferdinand VII and popular revolt\nFollowing the signing of the Treaty of Valen\u00e7ay, King Ferdinand VII returned to Spain in March 1814, resuming the throne that Napoleon had forced him to abdicate in 1808. Ferdinand rejected the liberal Constitution of 1812 that had been implemented in his absence and began a ferocious campaign of repression to restore the absolute monarchy, which was led by General Francisco Javier de El\u00edo.\n\nNebot worked for the Bertr\u00e1n de Lis brothers, conspiring against the King and organizing revolts against the monarchy. He also went around Valencia inciting the peasants to revolt against their feudal lords. In January he took part in an attempt to assassinate El\u00edo. Four men were arrested and executed and Nebot and Manuel Bertr\u00e1n de Lis had to flee to Gibraltar. Later that year Vicente Bertr\u00e1n de Lis sent Nebot to London to buy 2,000 rifles for the Bertr\u00e1n de Lis group for a planned uprising. There was another attempt to kill El\u00edo in January 1819; twenty-two men, including one of the sons of Vicente Bertr\u00e1n de Lis, were arrested and executed.\n\nIn 1820 the brothers sent Nebot to C\u00e1diz to ask for men, weapons and ships to proclaim the Constitution of 1812 in Valencia. The organizers of Rafael del Riego\u2019s anti-monarchical uprising were in C\u00e1diz at this time. Nebot was promoted to Brigadier and gave him the men and ships he requested. He set sail for Valencia but there was a violent storm and his ships were separated and forced ashore further south. By the time Nesbot's forces reached Valencia, Ferdinand VII had already accepted the Constitution, ushering in the Trienio Liberal government. In 1822 Nebot joined the supporters of the new Liberal government and was involved in street fighting against the Spanish Royal Guard. On 4 September 1822 he was in Valencia to witness the execution of El\u00edo. In 1822 and 1823 he and the brothers were fighting against the Royalist troops in Valencia.\n\nLife abroad\n\nIn 1824 Ferdinand asked the French for help to restore an absolute monarchy and an army of French and Belgian volunteers, the Hundred Thousand Sons of Saint Louis, invaded Spain. The Liberals were defeated and many of them fled abroad, including Nebot who settled in London. In 1825 he went on a secret mission to Ireland on behalf of Lord William Bentinck and he may have visited Ireland again after this. Historian Charles M. Wilson assumes that Nebot took part in a failed attempt to enter Spain through Portugal in 1827 and was involved in the July Revolution in Paris in July 1830 and in the planned invasion of northern Spain across the Pyrenees in October 1830. In January 1831 Nebot wrote to the Spanish ambassador in London, Francisco Cea Berm\u00fadez, asking for permission to return to Spain. The Spanish government replied to Cea Berm\u00fadez's letter saying that they did not trust Nebot but would allow him to return if he agreed to act as an anti-Liberal spy. Nebot reportedly never returned to Spain.\n\nReferences \n\nManuel Ardit Lucas -  Revoluci\u00f3n liberal y revuelta campesina.

The sculpture is said to be from the Heian period, around the 12th century. The Standing Twelve Heavenly Generals are the guardians of Yakushi Nyorai, a Buddhist god of medicine. The Standing Twelve Heavenly Generals are depicted as standing, life-sized statues and are arranged in pairs along the vertical axis. The figures are highly distinctive in their appearance, with various postures, facial expressions, and garments. Each figure has a unique weapon for carrying out their duties as the guardians of Yakushi Nyorai. These weapons represent the victory over negative forces and promote the power of healing in the world. One of the most unique features of the Standing Twelve Heavenly Generals is their intricate details. The intricate details also include the gold leaf and red lacquer on both the figures and their weapons, making them visually striking in appearance. The gold leaf of the sculptures has been so well preserved that even after years of being exhibited and kept in storage, it still shines brightly. For over eight centuries, the Standing Twelve Heavenly Generals have been regarded as the essential iconography of Japanese Buddhism. They have played a vital role in Japanese art, religion and culture. The Tokyo National Museum has had the honour of hosting the Standing Twelve Heavenly Generals since 1962. The exhibition of these sculptures has contributed to preserving the cultural heritage and values of Japan, making them a national treasure and a symbol of cultural pride. In 1999 the Standing Twelve Heavenly Generals were nominated to be placed on the UNESCO Memory of the World Register, in recognition of their cultural significance.

The Bosnian TO was gained control by the Bosnian-Serb SDS in the coalition government. On 19 December 1990 Alija Izetbegovi\u0107 and the SDA party alarmed by the SDS's secessionists attitudes discussed forming an independent Bosnian army later Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In March 1991 Sefer Halilovi\u0107 formed the Patriotic League (Patriotska Liga - PL) as an independent Bosnian army, with the same territorial organization as the TO.\n\nIt was in early 1992 that the JNA, Bosnian-Serb and Serbian paramilitary militias began attacking Bosnian-Muslim and Bosnian-Croat towns and villages the first ones being Sarajevo by the JNA and Bijeljina by paramilitary forces. On 4 April, Alija Izetbegovi\u0107 ordered general mobilization: and on 8 April he transformed the Sarajevo TO command into GHQ of the Teritorijalna Odbrana Republike Bosne i Hercegovine (Territorial Defence Force of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina) (TORBIH), appointing the Bosnian-Muslim Colonel Hasan Efendi\u0107 as commander of the army, Colonel Stjepan \u0160iber, a Bosnian-Croat, became chief-of-staff, and Colonel Jovan Divjak, a Bosnian-Serb, his deputy. The TO was formally established on 15 April when all Patriotic League units joined the force. On 20 May 1992 the TORBIH, PL, and other militias and the Bosnian-Croat HVO and HOS were officially united as Armed Forces of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina (Oruzane Snage Republike Bosne i Hercegovine). On 23 May Colonel Efendi\u0107 was replaced as commander by Sefer Halilovi\u0107.\n\nArmy of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\nOn 20 May 1992 the TORBIH was renamed Armija Republike Bosne i Hercegovine (Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina) - ARBIH, usually abbreviated ABIH. In November 1993, Sefer Halilovi\u0107 was replaced as commander of ABIH by Rasim Deli\u0107.\n\nOrganization 1992\u20131994\n\nThe ARBIH, now around 80,000 strong was reorganized on 18 August 1992 into a more conventional structure. Initially four corps were created: 1st Corps (Sarajevo); 2nd Corps (Tuzla) in northern Bosnia; 3rd Corps (Zenica) and 4th Corps (Mostar) in Herzegovina; the Eastern Bosnian Operational Group in the eastern enclaves of Gora\u017ede. 5th Corps (Biha\u0107) was established on 21 October 1992 from the Una-Sana Operational Group to defend the North-Western Bosnian enclave. The 7th Corps (Travnik) was established on 7 April 1994 with brigades from the 3rd Corps to advance north-westward through southern Bosnia. The 6th Corps (Konjic) was formed in June 1993 from the 4th Corps Northern Herzegovina Operational Group, to occupy northern Hercegovina from the HVO and eventually reach the Adriatic coast.\n\nEach corps controlled a number of brigades, independent battalions and companies. Brigades were designed as infantry, mountain, motorized or light and given new three digit numbers, the first number indicating the corps. The larger corps (1st, 2nd and 3rd) comprised 15 Operationa Groups, each with 3\u20137 brigades. From August 1992 to December 1994 about 105 brigades were formed or reformed in the 1-527 series: 48 infantry or undesigned, 41 mountain, 10 motorized and 6 light, but not all brigades existed at the same time. There were also single commando and reconnaissance, Military Police battalions and artillery brigades: the various independent units included the Delta SF Unit, four commando detachments, six Corps HQ MP battalions, a mixed artillery battalion and an independent armoured company. Eight Bosnian-Croat HVO units were incorporated into the ABIH. Crni Labudovi was a PL unit formed in April 1992 from refugees in Konjic under the 4th Corps (later 1st Corps), they eventually numbered 800 men and earned a reputation for battlefield bravery.\n\nSome PL units after the absorption by the TORBIH still operated independently. PL personnel wore \"Green Berets\" as did many ABIH units. The ABIH assigned 15 mixed aircraft to corps HQs to supply 5th corps in Bihac and 2nd corps in the Gora\u017ede, Srebrenica and \u017depa area. The Bosnian Police (Policija Republike Bosne i Hercegovine) were formed in 1992 from districts under Bosnian control and there was a Bosnian Special Police Unit (specijalna jedinica). There were no naval forces.\n\nOrganization 1995\nIn January 1995 the ARBIH now expanded to 200,000 reorganized. The Operational Groups in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 7th Corps were redesigned as divisions, each division comprising 3\u20136 brigades, but the 4th and 5th Corps kept their brigades and structure.

The army was primarily composed of Bosniak (Bosnian Muslim) soldiers, with smaller numbers of Croats and Serbs joining later on. The ARBiH was formed in the early days of the Bosnian War, when Bosnia and Herzegovina declared its independence from Yugoslavia. The army was initially unorganized and poorly equipped, but it quickly grew in size and strength as the war dragged on. By 1994, the ARBiH was estimated to have around 100,000 soldiers. The ARBiH was involved in many major battles throughout the war. One of its earliest victories was the defense of the town of Srebrenica against Serbian forces in 1992. The army also played a key role in breaking the Serbian siege of Sarajevo in 1995. Throughout the war, the ARBiH faced many challenges, including a lack of weapons and resources, infighting between different factions, and the involvement of foreign fighters on all sides. The army also faced accusations of war crimes, particularly against Bosnian Serb civilians. Following the signing of the Dayton Agreement in 1995, which ended the Bosnian War, the ARBiH was formally disbanded and replaced by the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Many former members of the ARBiH went on to join the new army, and some military units and equipment were transferred over as well. Today, the ARBiH is remembered as a symbol of Bosnian resistance during the war. Its soldiers and commanders are celebrated as heroes by many Bosniaks, and the army is often held up as an example of the courage and determination of the Bosnian people during their struggle for independence. However, the legacy of the ARBiH remains controversial and divisive, with many Serbs and Croats still viewing the army as a source of fear and trauma.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 13700475}

His crimes became more substantial however and in 1975 he was arrested for smuggling weapons through Switzerland (with the help of Elisabeth Von Dyck) and served six months in a detention centre. He was released and immediately went underground.\n\nHaag became an important member of the second generation of the RAF and recruited many new members. He was once quoted as saying; \"If I am a general in the Red Army Faction, Baader is a mere corporal.\"\n\nHe took part in a number of bank robberies, was involved in logistics and weapons procurement.  It is thought that he was crucial in planning the West German embassy siege in Stockholm, though he himself did not take part. For a period between 1975 and 1976, Haag underwent guerilla warfare training in a Southern Yemen camp, before returning to West Germany.\n\nArrest\n\nIn November 1976 Haag was arrested in Hanover when police stopped a stolen car that he was driving. In the vehicle they found weapons and cryptic documents that revealed details of the Hanns Martin Schleyer kidnapping, which were deciphered at a later time, only in hindsight. With Haag in prison, leadership of the group was assumed by Brigitte Mohnhaupt, though authorities suspected for a while that somehow Haag was still issuing commands from prison.\n\nIn 1979 Haag was sentenced to 15 years in prison by a Stuttgart court.

He won several medals, titles, and records in both sports, making him one of the most accomplished athletes in his field. Haag was born and raised in Bad Neustadt an der Saale, a town in Lower Franconia, Bavaria. He first showed an interest in athletics in his teenage years, particularly in throwing events, which he found challenging and rewarding. He joined the local athletics club, TV 1862 Bad Neustadt, and began training under renowned coaches such as Hans-Gerd J\u00f6rgensen and Heinz Ollesch. Haag's breakthrough came in 1975, when he won the German national championship in discus throwing with a distance of 62.26 meters, setting a new personal best and a competition record. He repeated this feat in the following years, winning the title for a total of eight times in his career, between 1975 and 1987. He also won the shot put title in 1985 and held the national record in discus throwing for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, with a mark of 67.58 meters. On the international level, Haag competed in three consecutive Olympic Games, starting with the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, where he finished eighth in discus throwing. He improved his ranking to fifth place in the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, setting a personal best of 66.10 meters in the process. His last Olympic appearance was in the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, where he competed in both discus throwing and shot put but failed to reach the final. Haag also participated in several European and World Championships, earning his best results in discus throwing. He won a silver medal at the 1982 European Championships in Athens, Greece, with a distance of 65.32 meters, and a bronze medal at the 1986 European Championships in Stuttgart, Germany, with a throw of 65.80 meters. He also finished seventh at the 1983 World Championships in Helsinki, Finland, with a mark of 64.86 meters. After retiring from professional sports in 1991, Haag became a sports teacher and coach, mentoring young athletes in his hometown and nearby areas. He was awarded the Federal Cross of Merit in 1997, in recognition of his contributions to athletics and his role as a mentor and role model to many young athletes.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Del Webb Explosion\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Del Webb Explosion was a seven-piece band cast in the mold of British soul revivalists Dexy's Midnight Runners. (They) were active in Adelaide for only 20 months from 1981\u20131983 with their first gig at the Union Hotel on 7 December 1981. A brass based pop band with strong British soul influences, The band was founded in Adelaide, South Australia, by Peter Flierl who had just returned from a trip to the UK with an incredibly strong impression having been left by the sounds of Dexys Midnight Runners and the very recently formed splinter group from that ensemble, The Bureau. The band's name was provided by early Del Webb guitarist, Gerry Barrett, and was named after American construction magnate and real estate developer, Delbert Eugene Webb.  The 'Explosion' just seemed to follow.\n\nHistory\n\nBeginning\nPeter Flierl (bass guitar, backing vocals, song-writing) started with an advertisement in the local newspaper 'want ads' seeking like-minded musicians to form an 8 piece soul/pop band to play a mix of original and cover songs. Drummer Heinz Stein responded early and was clearly attuned to what Flierl had in mind. Mankyboddle (lead vocals), Barrett (guitar) and Pasetto (tenor sax) were enlisted shortly afterwards, forming the nucleus of the band. Rehearsals commenced with a handful of early songs written for the band by Flierl together with several soul standards and rounded off with a generous selection of Dexys songs from their debut release, 'Searching for the Young Soul Rebels. The band's initial line-up was rounded off with the twin trumpets of Daniel Clements and Rob Symons. A debut gig supporting local favourites, The Screaming Believers, at the Union Hotel, introduced the band to an appreciative Adelaide audience and from then the 'Explosion' proceeded to gig regularly for the approximate 12 months of its existence.\n\nAlthough being integral to scoring brass charts to Flierl's initial compositions for the band, Pasetto left the band prior to their initial foray into the now defunct Pepper Recording Studios in North Adelaide. Symons had also departed around this time and the band recruited Burton on alto sax and Berrington on tenor to record the band's debut single \"One Way Love\" b/w \"Going Home\". The single was released on small local label 'Empty Dogma Records' and proceeded to notch up respectable local sales bringing the band to the attention of a wider audience. The band also self-financed a film clip shot at various suburban locations in Adelaide, to further promote the song. Although not venturing beyond the outskirts of the city, the band maintained a steady gigging profile building its fan base from regular performances at inner city venues like the Tivoli and Angas Hotels as well as regular appearances at the Adelaide University Bar.\n\nMiddle\nA heavy schedule of gigging from the outset created a level of interest from some of the major record labels in Adelaide. However cracks were beginning to show in the band with some members clearly not having the same commitment as others. It was around this time that Barrett was replaced by Oldman on lead guitar duties. Although still unsigned, the band decided to foray into the studio a second time to record the Mankyboddle penned \"Gardening as Finer Art\" backed with Flierl's \"Too Late The Hero\". Funds were tighter this time around for the band which resulted in a 'live' rendition of \"Too Late The Hero\" (recorded some weeks earlier at an Adelaide Uni Bar gig) becoming the B-side. The new single was released on local alternative record label, Greasy Pop Records and despite not having a video clip to accompany it, continued to increase the profile of the band with record company representatives. Keyboardist, Glenn Errington also left the band during this period to be replaced by Peter Flierl's multi-instrumentalist brother, Vic Flierl on keyboards at many 'live' performances by the band.\nAlthough the band continued to receive praise for their exciting stage performances, the band seemed to have \"more factions than a Labor Party conference\", largely due to musical differences, commitment and direction.\n\nEnd\nOnly 13 months into its existence and with a recording contract virtually on its door step, the band split with Flierl, Stein and Burton departing to form another band, Plan B, while Mankyboddle, Clements, Berrington & Oldman continued without them.      The band returned to public performances some 4 months later under the banner \"Del Webb Explosion \u2013 Back without Geno\", a clear statement that the earlier Dexys' influence which was such a major part of Flierl's basis for forming the band, was no longer in existence. In fact, when questioned about Geno at a show at the Tivoli in 1983, Mankyboddle said \"Geno was dead\"\n \nEven though the final Line-Up didn't produce any records, it made some very good live recordings in which the new material took centre stage. According to Mankyboddle, new member Kim Webster (later New Romantics) on keyboards was an important facet of the new direction the band took. Del Webb Explosion Mark III was the attempt to forge, in this kind of band line-up, a more original band from what for a long time was essentially a cover band.The final break up in the end was due to a lack of commitment to go \"professional\", i.e. interstate, even though the actual band personalities and individual musicianship were much better matched. So, in the end it wasn't so much friction, as the lack of ambition of some of the new members. The reformed band permanently broke up in late 1983.\n\nBeyond Del Webb\nFlierl, Stein and Burton quickly re-grouped to form Plan B which re-commenced gigging virtually the same week as the 'new' Del Webb Explosion. Following the second and final implosion of Del Webb Explosion, Mankyboddle joined forces with Steve Z to form The Sweets of Sin, an experimental crossover pop-band with strong modern classical and jazz influences.\n\nMembers\n\nOriginal\n Peter Flierl\n Heinz Stein\n Gerry Barrett\n Raimondo Pasetto\n Glenn Errington\n Daniel Clements\n Rob Symons\n Frank Moller (later Frank Mankyboddle)\n\nAdditional/Short Term\n Andy Berrington\n John Oldman\n Russell Burton\n Vic Flierl\n Kim Webster\n John Hastings\n Chris Woods\n\nDiscography\n One Way Love b/w Going Home - Single - Empty Dogma (1981)\n Gardening as Finer Art b/w Too Late the Hero - Single - Greasy Pop Records (1982)\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n SA Memory article on Gardening as a Finer Art\n Music Australia reference to One Way Love\n This was the MODern World Article on Adelaide 80's Mod scene by David Robinson\n Spencer, Chris.

A gas leak in one of the underground propane tanks caused an explosion that destroyed the Del Webb administration Building, located at 20803 N 99th Ave, killing one person and injuring 15 others. The Del Webb administration building was the center of operations for the Del Webb Corporation, a company founded by Del Webb in 1928. The company was responsible for the creation of many planned communities across the United States, including the famous Sun City, Arizona, where the explosion occurred. The explosion occurred at 2:50 pm when employees were preparing for a meeting. The force of the blast was so powerful that it shattered windows and was felt as far as two miles away. The building was completely destroyed, and many surrounding buildings were damaged. The explosion led to a massive response from emergency services, with more than 100 firefighters and 40 medical personnel arriving at the scene. They worked tirelessly to rescue those who were trapped in the rubble, and treated those injured in the explosion. The investigation into the explosion revealed that the cause was a gas leak in an underground propane tank, which had been damaged during construction work. The gas had seeped into the building and, when ignited, caused the explosion. The Del Webb Explosion was a tragic event that had a profound impact on the community. The Del Webb Corporation, now a subsidiary of Pulte Homes, continues to be a major player in the construction industry, but the memories of the explosion will always remain. The company established a memorial to the victim of the explosion, which can be seen at the present Del Webb administration building.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 31701543}

The original foundation of Upp\u00e5kra is dated to the last century BC, although its importance appears to have increased in the fifth century. It seems likely that the rulers of Upp\u00e5kra by then wielded influence over most or all of West Scania, i.e. the land along the Trelleborg\u2013Helsingborg main road, known for extraordinarily fertile plains.\n\nUpp\u00e5kra declined and was possibly in part relocated to Lund in the 990s. Knowledge about the decline of Upp\u00e5kra and the relocation to Lund is still unsure. Hence Upp\u00e5kra is held to be the direct predecessor of the city of Lund. However, the area has been continuously inhabited all since, with the two villages of Lilla Upp\u00e5kra and Stora Upp\u00e5kra mentioned as 'first and second Upp\u00e5kra' in medieval documents. Like the rest of Scania, Upp\u00e5kra was Danish until 1658. In early modern documents from the Danish era, the two villages were called Opager, which remained their name in the local dialect until the mid-20th century.\n\nArchaeology\nA Bronze to Iron Age settlement was found in 1934, when a farm was built close to the church. The first excavation that year was done by the Archaeologist Bror Magnus Vifot.\nGeological studies carried out by a sugar company in the 1930s revealed that the site around the church of Upp\u00e5kra was extremely rich in phosphate, the highest concentration of it in Scania. Since excrement contains phosphate, this indicates the presence of many cattle and people over time. The study was conducted by Olof Arrhenius across the province of Scania.\n\nIn the middle of 1990 investigations with metal detectors revealed almost 30,000 gold, silver and bronze objects.\nArchaeological excavations in a 100-acre (0.40\u00a0km2) field intensified in 1996: they show Upp\u00e5kra to have been among the richest and largest Iron Age\u2013Viking Age towns on the Scandinavian Peninsula. \nFor centuries, maybe for most of the first millennium, Upp\u00e5kra was a place of religious and political power; remains of a pre-Christian temple excavated during  2000\u20132004 demonstrated that it was also an important cult place.\n\nDuring excavations in the summer of 2007, the remains of a building destroyed by fire were investigated. The building was situated just to the west of the temple.  It was presumably a longhouse of more than 40 metres in length, built in the 5th or 6th century. The excavations also yielded a large amount of ceramic, bone, and glass artefacts, and a number of metal objects in iron, bronze and gold,\nincluding fibulae, two identically stamped bracteates, and a probable surgical instrument.  \nOne of the objects excavated in 2007, interpreted as representing an ornamental lion, made headlines due to its peculiar resemblance to Mickey Mouse.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Upp\u00e5kra's website\n Historical Museum Lund Barbaricum\n\nArchaeological sites in Sweden\nScania\nPopulated places in Staffanstorp Municipality\nViking Age populated places\nPopulated places in Sk\u00e5ne County", "machine_text": "Upp\u00e5kra is an archaeological site located in southern Sweden, near the town of Lund. It was a significant center of power and trade during the Iron Age and Viking Age, dating from approximately 200-1050 AD. Upp\u00e5kra was one of the most important places in Scandinavia during this time, and it is considered one of the country's most important archaeological sites. The site was first discovered in the 1930s and has been extensively excavated since then. Some of the most significant findings include the remains of an early Christian church, a large marketplace, and a number of residential buildings, as well as the remains of a defensive wall and several fortresses. Upp\u00e5kra was a major trading center, connecting the Baltic region with continental Europe and the British Isles. The site was strategically located at the intersection of several important trade routes, and it is believed to have played a key role in the development of the Viking Age trade networks. The area around Upp\u00e5kra is rich in resources such as iron, timber, and fertile land, making it an attractive location for settlement. The site is also notable for its early Christian church, one of the oldest in Sweden, which was built in the 900s. The church was likely built to serve the growing Christian population in the area, and it has been suggested that the construction of the church was encouraged by the local ruling elite as a way to help legitimize their power. Today, visitors can see the remains of Upp\u00e5kra's fortifications, marketplaces, and residential buildings. The site is open to the public and has a small museum showcasing some of the most significant finds from the excavations.

African scholars and historians are increasingly recognizing the importance of examining African sources as a means to correct the biases that have arisen from relying primarily on colonial and Western sources for African history. African Sources for African History scholars examine various sources to understand African history, including oral traditions, local archives, and colonial records. They use these sources to analyze and interpret various events in African history, such as the slave trade, colonialism, and African independence movements, among others. This approach has been particularly important in uncovering the histories and experiences of previously marginalized groups in Africa, such as women, slaves, and minority ethnic groups. It has also allowed for the development of new and alternative narratives that present African history from an African perspective, emphasizing the agency of Africans in shaping their own history. Scholars of African Sources for African History have faced challenges in terms of access to archives and resources, as many of these sources remain unstudied or inaccessible due to political instability, lack of funding, or inadequate preservation. However, various organizations and initiatives have emerged aimed at promoting the preservation and accessibility of African sources, such as the African Digital Heritage Project, which has been digitizing African archives and making them available online. African Sources for African History represents a growing and important field of study for African scholars and historians as it seeks to challenge dominant narratives of African history and to create a more accurate and inclusive historical record of the African continent.

After independence in 1960, Radio Nationale du Mali (Radio-Mali) began broadcasting from la maison de la Radio in the Bozola neighbourhood of Bamako.  Technical abilities were bolstered with Czech transmitters ranging from 18 to 30 kilowatts in 1962.\n\nIn 1970, the Chinese government constructed four 50\u00a0kW radio transmitters about 7\u00a0km from Bamako, towards Kati, enabling Radio Mali to reach much of West Africa. In 22 September 1983, a Libyan financed television broadcast centre was opened in Bamako, enabling RTM to broadcast one channel of colour television. French and German grant programmes between 1984 and 1990 enabled news and reporting to expand, with regional stations opening in S\u00e9gou (1986), Koulikoro (1989), Sikasso (1990) and Mopti (1993). In 1992, a second national broadcast radio network (Chiffre II) was added.\n\nOn 5 October 1992, the Malian government split off the RTM  according to \"Law 92-021\", from direct government control, becoming a publicly financed, independently run entity (an \"\u00c9tablissement Public \u00e0 Caract\u00e8re Administratif (EPA)\"). This was part of the national liberalisation process, moving the nation to the \"Third Malian Republic\". Private broadcasters were legalised, and RTM was reorganised as the ORTM on 1 January 1993.\n\nORTM was seized by National Committee for the Restoration of Democracy and State (CNRDR) forces on 21 March 2012 as part of the 2012 Malian coup d'\u00e9tat. A thousand-person protest was held on 26 March, chanting \"Down with Sanogo\" and \"Liberate the ORTM\".\n\nCurrent output\nIn 2002, ORTM had 35 local radio and/or television broadcast points or repeaters, with TV/radio broadcast points in all eight Regions of Mali.  From its headquarters in Bamako, ORTM produces two radio networks (RTM and Chiffre II), a national television network (RTM), and directs the work of a number of regional RTM radio stations.\n\nConsidered one of the freest news markets in Africa, although government office holders threaten (and sometimes resort to) prosecution of broadcasters under Mali's strict anti-libel laws.  In 2001, the head of OTRM was threatened with jail after the government attempted to prosecute RTM for an interview in which the mayor of Bamako accused the Malian judiciary of corruption.  Since 1992, broadcasting is no longer a state monopoly.  There are two large private multi-channel television providers, and numerous private radio stations.  Mali is also considered a world leader in community radio development, with ORTM helping to set up the Union des Radios et Televisions Libres (URTEL) , a network of over a hundred independently locally operated stations.  OTRM also partners with other government and international organisations in education and development programs throughout Mali.\n\nProgramming\nRTM Radio and television broadcast news and information programming, light entertainment (both foreign and domestic), music and sport.  Most national broadcasts are in French, with several hours of Bambara language programming, as well as regional broadcasting in other languages. Emission Hebdomadaire d'Information, the weekly ORTM news magazine, has been broadcasting each Sunday at noon since 1998, and is anchored by Manga Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 and Youssouf Tour\u00e9.  A daily news program is broadcast twice daily.  Chiffre II radio network is simulcast on the OTRM website, while television broadcasts are carried on regional satellite.  ORTM television regularly broadcasts local sport, mostly  Malien Premi\u00e8re Division football matches, to an eager audience at least three days a week.\n\nReferences\n\nGeneral\n www.ortm.ml/ Office de radiodiffusion et de t\u00e9l\u00e9vision du Mali.\n Pascal James Imperato,  Historical Dictionary Of Mali.

Here,  values of shift factor aT are obtained by horizontal shift log(aT) of creep compliance data plotted vs. time or frequency in double logarithmic scale so that a data set obtained experimentally at temperature T superposes with the data set at temperature Tr. A minimum of three values of aT are needed to obtain C1, C2, and typically more than three are used.\n\nOnce constructed, the WLF equation allows for the estimation of the temperature shift factor for temperatures other than those for which the material was tested. In this way, the master curve can be applied to other temperatures. However, when the constants are obtained with data at temperatures above the  glass transition temperature (Tg), the WLF equation is applicable to temperatures at or above Tg only; the constants are positive and represent Arrhenius behavior. Extrapolation to temperatures below Tg is erroneous. When the constants are obtained with data at temperatures below Tg, negative values of C1, C2 are obtained, which are not applicable above Tg and do not represent Arrhenius behavior. Therefore, the constants obtained above Tg are not useful for predicting the response of the polymer for structural applications, which necessarily must operate at temperatures below Tg.\n\nThe WLF equation is a consequence of time\u2013temperature superposition (TTSP), which mathematically is an application of\nBoltzmann's superposition principle. It is TTSP, not WLF, that allows the assembly of a compliance master curve that spans more time, or frequency, than afforded by the time available for experimentation or the frequency range of the instrumentation, such as dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA).\n\nWhile the time span of a TTSP master curve is broad, according to Struik, it is valid only if the data sets did not suffer from ageing effects during the test time. Even then, the master curve represents a hypothetical material that does not age. Effective Time Theory. needs to be used to obtain useful prediction for long term time.\n\nHaving data above Tg, it is possible to predict the behavior (compliance, storage modulus, etc.) of viscoelastic materials for temperatures T>Tg, and/or for times/frequencies longer/slower than the time available for experimentation. With the master curve and associated WLF equation it is possible to predict the mechanical properties of the polymer out of time scale of the machine (typically  to  Hz), thus extrapolating the results of multi-frequency analysis to a broader range, out of measurement range of machine.\n\nPredicting the Effect of Temperature on Viscosity  by the WLF Equation \n\nThe Williams-Landel-Ferry model, or WLF for short, is usually used for polymer melts or other fluids that have a glass transition temperature.\n\nThe model is:\n\nwhere T-temperature, , ,  and  are empiric parameters (only three of them are independent from each other).\n\nIf one selects the parameter  based on the glass transition temperature, then the parameters ,  become very similar for the wide class of polymers.

It is named after Walter Kauzmann Williams, Alban Landel, and John Ferry, who independently proposed the equation in the 1950s. The WLF equation provides a way to predict the viscosity of amorphous polymers at temperatures other than those at which the viscosity was measured. The equation is given by: log (\u03b7 / \u03b70) = C1 \u00d7 (T - T0) / (C2 + T - T0) Where, \u03b7 is the viscosity at the temperature T, \u03b70 is the viscosity at the reference temperature T0, C1 and C2 are constants that depend on the polymer, and T0 is the glass transition temperature of the polymer. The WLF equation is widely used in polymer science and engineering to characterise the viscoelastic behaviour of amorphous polymers. It is based on the assumption that the molecular motion that contributes to viscosity obeys an Arrhenius-type temperature dependence. This equation has been found to be accurate for a wide range of polymers over temperatures spanning from the glass transition temperature up to the polymer's thermal degradation temperature. The accuracy of the WLF equation is limited by the assumption that the polymer is in a purely amorphous state. This assumption is not always applicable, especially for crystalline polymers or those containing additives like plasticizers. Nevertheless, the WLF equation remains one of the key tools for characterising the viscoelastic behaviour of amorphous polymers. In conclusion, the Williams\u2013Landel\u2013Ferry equation is a widely used empirical equation that relates the temperature dependence of viscosity of amorphous polymers.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Albertanus of Brescia\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Albertanus of Brescia (Italian: Albertano da Brescia, c. 1195 \u2013 c. 1251) was an author of Latin social treatises and sermons.\n\nBiography\nAlbertanus was from Brescia, in northern Italy, but little is known of his early life. He had three sons, Vincent, Stephen, and John (who was a surgeon). He was a notary and causidici (professional legal counselor).\n\nHe first appears in the historical record in 1226 as a judge renewing the Lombard League. In 1238 he was named captain to defend the town of Gavardo against the forces of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor. Defeated, he was imprisoned for a few months at Cremona, where he found the time to start a writing career.\n\nHis first work was De amore et dilectione Dei et proximi et aliarum rerum et de forma vitae (\"On love and delight in God and in neighbor and other matters concerning the rule of life\"; 1238), a treatise on Christian conceptions of life under religious rule which quotes frequently from Seneca the Younger's Epistulae morales ad Lucilium (64 AD). In 1245 he wrote the treatise De doctrina dicendi et tacendi (\"On teaching about speech and silence\"), which discussed the place of notaries in public life, and more generally explored the newly emerging role of the professional in public life.\n\nAlbertanus' best known work is his Liber consolationis et consilii (\"Book of Consolation and Counsel\"). Written in 1246, it dramatically investigates the causes of human violence by examining the urban vendetta. Geoffrey Chaucer's \"The Tale of Melibee\" is a close translation of Renaud de Louens' Livre de Melibee et de Dame Prudence (1336) which is itself a translation of Albertanus' Liber consolationis et consilii.\n\nHis last work is from 1250 and is a series of four sermons presented to his fellow causidici at Brescia, in which he explained the meaning of their rule.\n\nIn total he was the author of three major treatises and five \u2018sermons\u2019, public addresses to his fellow causidici at their professional meetings.\n\nA central goal from the start for Albertanus was to present a rule of life that would lay the foundation for a good society. He believed in the importance of moral restraint based on voluntary participation in a community.\n\nInfluences\nAlbertanus read and was influenced by Seneca the Younger, Cicero, St. Augustine, the Wisdom literature of the Old Testament, and some 12th century authors.\n\nAlbertanus was very influential; his works were known and used by: Brunetto Latini, John Gower, Peter Idle, Erhart Gross, Geoffrey Chaucer, Renaut de Louens, Dirc Potter, Heinrich Schl\u00fcsselfelder, Antonio de Torquemada, Jan van Boendale, archbishop Pedro Gomez Barroso of Seville, Bono Giamboni, Raimund of B\u00e9ziers, Zucchero Bencivenni, the author of the Fiore di virt\u00f9, the author of the Cavallero Zifar, Guilhelm Molinier, Christine de Pizan, Jacobus von J\u00fcterbog, Aegidius Albertinus, and Fernando de Rojas.\n\nThere were many translations of his works into French, German, Tuscan, Venetian, Spanish, Catalan, and Dutch, with a wide circulation well into the 15th and early 16th centuries, a testament to his broader influence on society. The Tuscan version was made by Andrea of Grosseto, who was considered one of the first writers in the Italian language.\n\nBibliography\nJames M. Powell (1992).

Born in the city of Brescia in Italy, he lived from around 1195 to 1250. He is known for his many works on moral philosophy, including his treatise \"De Bono and Malo\" (On Good and Evil). Albertanus was a student of the famous philosopher and theologian Peter Lombard at the University of Paris. He also studied under other prominent thinkers of his time, such as Alexander of Hales and William of Auxerre. During his lifetime, he wrote a number of influential works on Christian ethics and morality. His most famous work, \"De Bono and Malo,\" is an examination of different aspects of morality, such as virtue, vice, and the nature of God. One of Albertanus' most important contributions to philosophy was his emphasis on the importance of reason and rationality. He believed that reason was an essential tool for understanding the world and making moral judgments. He also believed in the power of education and the importance of intellectual development. In addition to his contributions to philosophy, Albertanus was also a prolific writer on other subjects, including grammar, rhetoric, and logic. He wrote a number of works on the proper use of language and the art of persuasion. Today, Albertanus of Brescia is remembered as one of the most important thinkers of the Middle Ages. His works on morality and reason continue to be studied and discussed by scholars around the world.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 9456743}

The emperor was a great lover of nature and gardens, and he is said to have spent many peaceful hours in Sonwar Bagh during his visits to the valley. The name of the garden, Sonwar Bagh, comes from the Persian word Sonar, which means \"a place where gold is found\".

The garden spreads over an area of about 16 acres and is surrounded by a high wall made of bricks. Sonwar Bagh was designed as a Mughal-style garden with fountains, water channels, and several varieties of flowering trees and plants. The garden is also home to several bird species, adding to its natural beauty.

His first project, Menudo an hour-long competition show, under the deal was announced to be in development in April 2020.\n\nBackground\n\nRevue Studios\nRevue Productions (later known as Revue Studios) was founded in 1943 by MCA Inc. to produce live radio shows and also produced \"Stage Door Canteen\" live events for the United Service Organizations (USO) during World War II. Revue was re-launched as MCA's television production subsidiary in 1950. The partnership of NBC and Revue extends as far back as September 6, 1950, with the television broadcast of Armour Theatre, based on radio's Stars Over Hollywood. MCA bought the Universal Studios lot in 1958 and was renamed Revue Studios. Following its merger with Decca Records, the then-parent of Universal Pictures, the studio backlot name was changed back to Universal. In 1963, MCA formed Universal City Studios to merge the Motion Picture and Television arms of both Universal Pictures and Revue Studios and Revue was officially renamed Universal Television in 1963.\n\nDuring the early years of television, Revue was responsible for producing and/or distributing many television programs. These included Leave It to Beaver, which ran for only one season on CBS before going to ABC from 1958 until 1963. In addition, Revue also made Alan Hale Jr.'s Biff Baker, U.S.A. (1952\u20131953) and all three of Rod Cameron's syndicated series, City Detective (1953\u20131955), State Trooper (1956\u20131959), and Coronado 9 (1960\u20131961) and the Bill Williams western series, The Adventures of Kit Carson (1951\u20131955). It produced Bachelor Father (1957\u20131962), for \"Bachelor Productions\", Edmond O'Brien's syndicated crime film Johnny Midnight, based on a fictitious New York City actor-turned-private investigator. Another of its offerings was the 52-episode Crusader, the first Brian Keith series, which ran on CBS 1955\u20131956. Another western produced by Revue and starring Audie Murphy was Whispering Smith (NBC, 1959/61), based on the 1948 Alan Ladd movie of the same name. Leave It to Beaver was produced first by George Gobel's Golmaco Productions, then by Kayro Productions on a back lot at Revue Studios from 1958 to 1963. Also McHale's Navy was produced by Revue from 1962 to 1966.\n\nIn December 1958, MCA/Revue purchased Universal Studios's 367-acre backlot to produce television series, then leased it back to Universal for a million dollars a year for a decade.\n\nRevue produced later seasons of The Jack Benny Program for CBS and NBC and in co-operation with Jack Benny's J and M productions Checkmate, General Electric Theater and Alfred Hitchcock Presents for CBS, Studio 57 for DuMont Television Network, and westerns such as Tales of Wells Fargo, The Restless Gun and Laramie for NBC, as well as Wagon Train for NBC and ABC, and the first two seasons of NBC's The Virginian, based on a film released originally by Paramount Pictures, whose pre-1950 theatrical sound feature film library was sold to MCA in 1957. Wagon Train was the only Revue-produced TV show ever to finish an American television season in first place.\n\nNBC Television Network/NBC Productions/NBC Studios\nNBC Television Network was founded in 1947 by RCA (NBC's former parent company). In 1955, NBC acquired production company Kagran Corporation, and by 1956, changed its company name to California National Productions. The company also brought several NBC-aired programs, like The Adventures of Hiram Holliday and The Lawless Years, as well as non-NBC programs like The Silent Service and Philip Marlowe, but none of them were successful. The company's first hit was the television show Bonanza, which lasted from 1959 to 1973 on the NBC television network. Its follow-up project that was produced independently was Outlaws, a western from 1960 to 1962. The third independently produced NBC show, The Americans, which aired only in 1961, lasted a few episodes, and bombed after only one season.\n\nIn 1961, California National changes its name to NBC Films, and in 1963, launched NBC Productions to continue producing its existing show Bonanza, and develop newer projects for the network. NBC developed and produced several shows internally like Kentucky Jones, Captain Nice and T.H.E. Cat. By 1966, the company had output talent deals with Sheldon Leonard, Bob Finkel, Norman Felton and David Dortort. The next big project was The High Chaparral, which was a hit among viewers throughout its four-season run, only to be axed in 1971 due to the rural purge. Throughout its partnership with Sheldon Leonard, they produced three shows Accidental Family, My Friend Tony and My World and Welcome to It, but none of them were successful. By 1974, NBC is producing the next big hit Little House on the Prairie.\n\nBy the 1980s, NBC is producing Punky Brewster, which was popular among viewers. NBC's production output was primarily on television movies and miniseries. NBC's other television series output were Sara and Roomies, both of them were unsuccessful. In 1985, Michael Filerman through his Michael Filerman Productions company inked a deal with NBC Productions to develop long-form telemovies and miniseries, as well as television series. In the late 1980s, NBC Productions attempted to get into the film business, but it was proven unsuccessful, after the failure of the film Codename: Emerald. In 1987, NBC Productions provided funding for a feature film that starred Cassandra Peterson as her Elvira character, which raised $5\u20136 million by NBC to fund the film. In 1988, NBC started a deal with Peter Engel that resulted in the creation of Good Morning, Miss Bliss and eventually producing a number of teen shows.\n\nIn early 1990, NBC had struck a development deal with musician/producer Quincy Jones and his Quincy Jones Entertainment company. Also the same year, NBC inked a deal with Jay Tarses for his production company. By 1990, NBC returned to producing hit programs with the sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel Air, which starred Will Smith, in one of the first TV roles. Also that same year, NBC Productions partnered with Group W Productions to develop a syndicated program House Party. In 1991, NBC produced another syndicated show, this time, out of the WMAQ-TV studios, Johnny B...On the Loose, in partnership with Viacom Enterprises.\n\nIn 1993, Perry Simon left NBC to start his own production company with a non-exclusive production agreement. In 1995, NBC launched a partnership with television director James Burrows to create 3 Sisters Entertainment, who produced series for the network. Out of these five, the most successful out of the venture were Will & Grace and Caroline in the City (co-produced and owned by CBS Productions). Later that year, NBC Productions was however folded into NBC's entertainment division.\n\nIn 1996, the company was renamed NBC Studios. The company had returned to producing hit programs like The Pretender, Profiler, Providence, Ed, Las Vegas and Crossing Jordan. In 2004, NBC Studios was merged with Universal Network Television to form NBC Universal Television Studios.\n\nUniversal Television (original iteration)\nThe first incarnation of Universal Television was reincorporated from Revue Productions in 1964, 2 years after MCA Inc. bought Universal Pictures and its then-current parent Decca Records. Among their many contributions to television programming included production of the first television film (See How They Run from 1964), the first wheel series (The Name of the Game from 1968), the first rotating series with an umbrella title (1969's The Bold Ones) and the first two-part television movie (Vanished from 1971). Uni TV (also commonly known as MCA/Universal) also co-produced many shows with Jack Webb's Mark VII Limited such as Emergency!, Adam-12 and a revival of the 1951 series Dragnet. During the 1970s and 1980s, Uni TV produced shows such as Baretta, The Rockford Files, Murder, She Wrote, Miami Vice, The Equalizer, The Incredible Hulk, Battlestar Galactica, Buck Rogers in the 25th Century, Knight Rider, The A-Team, Simon & Simon and Magnum, P.I., which received critical acclaim and several TV movie spin-offs after their cancellations.\n\nIn 1967, Grant Tinker, formerly employee of NBC was hired to join the studio. He held the position for two years, until he left in 1969 to join 20th Century-Fox Television, and later that year, had to start MTM Enterprises. He subsequently left Fox in 1971 due to conflicts with running MTM.\n\nIn 1980, Bud Austin has received a production contract with Universal Television to produce television series. One of the more notable and legendary contracts was writer/producer Dick Wolf, whose Universal association began in 1986 with Miami Vice, then writing for several more shows before creating the hit Law & Order franchise. In 1987, Universal Television, which by then, was the leading producers in prime time television programming, decided to have six pilots committed for network production value, plus three series for the 1987\u201388 season, which included development deals with people who already contracted with Universal.\n\nIn 1990, MCA/Uni TV began the Law & Order franchise. In 1991, Tom Thayer was named president of the Universal Television arm. In 1993, former Warner Bros. Television senior vice president of production employee Steven J. Papazian joined Universal Television as vice president of production. In 1992, Universal Television inked a deal with several newer talent, plus some returning and existing talent that were offered at the studio, including Ivan Reitman, David Burke, John Leekley and R.J. Stewart. In 1993, St. Clare Entertainment, a company owned by John Landis had reupped its contract at both MCA TV, MTE and Universal Television, three of the encompassing TV units of MCA via the MCA TV Group. In 1994, Universal Television made a financing partnership with ABC to help them fund the show Blue Skies.\n\nIn 1996, MCA was reincorporated as Universal Studios. Around the same time, Universal was acquired by Joseph A. Seagram and Sons and later acquired the Multimedia Entertainment and USA Network. Also that year, Universal Television collaborated with Warner Bros. Television to develop the series Spy Game for ABC, with Universal alumnus Sam Raimi and Robert Tapert of Renaissance Pictures, and Warner alumnus John McNamara producing the series, but it didn't last long, as it only lasted one season on the air.\n\nUniversal purchased a 50% stake of Brillstein-Grey Entertainment in 1996 for $75 to $100 million. They considered buying the other 50% after selling its own TV unit to Barry Diller in 1998. Universal sold its stake in BGE in 1999 and BGE was renamed as Brad Grey Television, though Universal continued to co-produce Just Shoot Me! and The Steve Harvey Show until their cancellations.\n\nEMKA, Ltd. is the holding company responsible for a majority of the pre-1950 Paramount Pictures sound library. As an official part of the Universal Pictures library, they are part of the company's television unit, Universal Television.\n\nMCA Television Entertainment\nFor the 1970s and 1980s, MCA TV, the syndication company, had a production shop that produced shows like Probe, which was for air on ABC.\n\nMTE (known as MCA Television Entertainment) was formed in 1989 as a telemovie and cable division of Universal Television. It primarily dealt with made-for-TV movies and series like Dream On that were made for cable networks like HBO. It was also a producer of first-run syndication programming for the Hollywood Premiere Network, which was distributed by MCA's own syndication arm MCA TV, as well as KCOP-TV in Los Angeles and WWOR-TV in New York, such as They Came from Outer Space, Shades of L.A. and She-Wolf of London, but it only lasted one season from 1990 to 1991, but it didn't last long.\n\nIn 1990, Michael Landsbury was named vice president of series programs, Angela Mancuso as vice president of production, and Michael Houbrick was named assistant director of publicity, at the studio.\n\nOne of the most notable clients of MTE was Papazian-Hirsch Entertainment, who produced a bulk of these television movies and series for the studio.\n\nIn 1996, it was renamed as Universal Television Entertainment (or UTE for short) to align with MCA's rebranding as Universal Studios. It was eventually renamed to Studios USA Pictures in 1998. MCA Television Entertainment is also a collective branding for their units owned and operated by MCA, and it absorbed Universal Family Entertainment and Universal Cartoon Studios in 1996.\n\nStudios USA Television\nUSA Networks Inc. was formed by Barry Diller when he bought Universal's major television assets in October 1997. Among its assets were the USA Network and Sci-Fi Network cable channels along with series such as Law & Order. Additionally, the company would own the HSN, the Ticketmaster Group and several TV stations. Universal TV's production and distribution unit was renamed Studios USA. Universal held on to its 50% share of Brillstein-Grey Entertainment, PolyGram's international channels and the rights to its TV library while signing a long-term domestic sales deal with Studios USA for the library. Universal got a 45% share in USA Networks Inc. Greg Meidel initially resigned and was rehired as chairman and CEO of Studios USA, only to leave in June 1998.\n\nIn 1999, USA Networks formed its own film and home media divisions when they acquired October Films and several production and distribution assets of PolyGram Filmed Entertainment for $200 million. Most of the new shows produced under the Studios USA name bombed after only one or two seasons; only Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, Law & Order: Criminal Intent and The District were deemed to be big hits. Although the latter two were cancelled, in 2011 and 2004 respectively, the former is still an ongoing show.\n\nIn 2000, Clyde Phillips has signed an overall deal with the studio to develop scripts made for the studio.\n\nIn 2001, Vivendi acquired USA's entertainment assets for an estimated $10.3 billion. Under the deal, Barry Diller became chairman of Vivendi Universal Entertainment. USA Networks is currently known as IAC. Shortly afterwards, in 2002, it was merged with Universal Studios Network Television, producers of NBC's sitcom Just Shoot Me! to form Universal Network Television.\n\nPolyGram Television/Universal Network Television\nIn 1997, PolyGram created not only its syndication unit, but a network unit for long-form television movies and drama series, which was a rebranding from the former ITC Entertainment television division of PolyGram. It was headed up by Bob Sanitsky, who headed the combined syndication and network divisions. In 1998, it inked a deal with Meg Ryan and her Prufock Pictures to set up her projects at the studio.\n\nIn early 1999, Shortly after Seagram and Universal completed their deal to acquire PolyGram.

It is still hailed as a pioneering exploration of the history of American memory, which has become an increasingly important topic for historians. Peterson undertook the work to assess what history had made of Thomas Jefferson. At the end of a decade, he published a lengthy one-volume biography, Thomas Jefferson and the New Nation (Oxford University Press, 1970), which he considered his most important book. His 1994 Lincoln in American Memory, was written from a similar stance as his first book on Jefferson. It was a finalist for the 1995 Pulitzer Prize for biography.\n \nPeterson's shorter studies include works on John Brown, President Woodrow Wilson, and Wilson's biographer, Ray Stannard Baker.  Peterson edited several anthologies of Jefferson's writings.\n\nIn 1988, Peterson published another landmark work, The Great Triumvirate: Webster, Clay, and Calhoun (Oxford University Press), a joint biography of Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, and John C. Calhoun.\n\nPart of a generation that was admonished in its youth to \"remember the starving Armenians,\" Peterson traveled to Armenia in 1997 as a Peace Corps volunteer and was moved by the country\u2019s troubled history.  After research, he edited a collection of essays published by the University of Virginia Press under the title \"Starving Armenians\": America and the Armenian Genocide 1915-1930 and After (2004), which explores the American response to the violence against and dispersion of the Armenian people during and after World War I, when more than 1.5 million of the country's minority population died.  He begins with the initial reports to President Woodrow Wilson from Henry Morgenthau, Sr., his ambassador to the Ottoman Empire.  Peterson also covers the contemporary period and the continuing campaign by ethnic Armenians and others to convince the U.S. government to officially recognize the actions as genocide, which Turkey has denied.\n\nLegacy and honors\n2005, the Library of Virginia gave Peterson its Literary Lifetime Achievement Award.\n1997, the First Freedom Council's National First Freedom Award \n1994, the Virginia Foundation for Humanities 20th Anniversary Award \n1994, the University of Virginia Phi Beta Kappa Book Award, and \n1960, the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation Gold Medal.\n\nPeterson died at Charlottesville, Virginia, on September 23, 2009.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Brief biography\n\n20th-century American historians\n20th-century American male writers\nWriters from Manhattan, Kansas\nWriters from Charlottesville, Virginia\nHarvard University alumni\n1921 births\n2009 deaths\nBancroft Prize winners\nHistorians from Virginia\nAmerican male non-fiction writers\nKansas State University alumni\nUniversity of Kansas alumni\nUniversity of Virginia faculty\nBrandeis University alumni\nPrinceton University alumni", "machine_text": "Merrill D.

R\u00e9 and Levi were among six children who were brought out to South Australia from Newcastle upon Tyne by their parents Solomon Isaacs (c. 1830 \u2013 30 August 1913) and his wife Pauline (c. 1830 \u2013 14 July 1923) aboard the ship Sophia around 1865\nGeorge Lewis married R\u00e9 Isaacs, elocution teacher and Adelaide Synagogue's longtime Sabbath School teacher, at the Synagogue on 16 August 1899.\n\nLewis was educated at Christian Brothers College, Wakefield Street, Adelaide, where he proved to be a gifted pupil. He studied medicine at the University of Adelaide and graduated with distinction in 1923 (M.B., B.S.).\n\nCareer\nLewis worked at the Royal Adelaide Hospital for two years and undertook anthropological research on Aboriginal Australians. In 1926 he accepted a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship in psychological medicine. This brought him to the Phipps Clinic under the mentorship of Adolf Meyer, whom he respected and admired greatly, and whose work he praised in lectures such as the Adolf Meyer Lecture in 1960. This was the start of two years postgraduate study performed in the US and thence on to Germany. Lewis then moved to the United Kingdom and joined the staff of the Maudsley Hospital London in 1928. In 1931 he received his M.D. from the University of Adelaide and in 1936 he became Clinical Director of the Maudsley Hospital. In 1938 he became a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians.\n\nLewis was a member of the Eugenics Society. A chapter he contributed to a 1934 book on 'The Chances of Morbid Inheritance', edited by Carlos Blacker, has been described as 'remarkable for its total admiration for the German work and workers\", including Ernst Rudin.\n\nInstitute of Psychiatry\nIn 1946 the Maudsley Hospital's medical school was re-designated the Institute of Psychiatry under the auspices of the University of London and Lewis was appointed to the inaugural Chair of Psychiatry at the institute. He held this post until his retirement in 1966.  It has been said that the flowering of British psychiatry after World War II can be attributed to three factors: a long humanitarian tradition; the National Health Service and Aubrey Lewis. Lewis built a reputation as a leader, educator and administrator and is credited with moulding the Institute into a model of scientific research and teaching attracting many of the most promising medical graduates from around the world. He is also credited with raising the profile of psychiatry worldwide, through his work as an adviser to general medical bodies, national and international research councils, and political organisations. He was a member of the Advisory Committee on Medical Research of the World Health Organization.\n\nMany esteemed psychiatrists worked under the direction of Lewis at the Institute of Psychiatry, including Martin Roth and Michael Shepherd; the latter was at great pains to point out that Lewis's impact also extended to his contributions as a clinician, scholar and researcher, particularly in the field of epidemiology, but also genetics, clinical phenomenology and biology. He was perhaps best known for his studies of melancholia and obsessional illness, and indeed guided the young Michael Shepherd on his research into morbid jealousy.\n\nHonours and awards\nKnighthood in 1959\n Honorary fellow of the Royal College of Psychiatrists (1972)\n\nFamily and personal life\nOn 22 February 1934 at the Liberal Jewish Synagogue, Marylebone, London Lewis married Hilda North Stoessiger, a child psychiatrist. Hilda died in 1966 which affected Lewis greatly. They had two daughters and two sons, all of whom survived Lewis. Lewis died on 21 January 1975 in Charing Cross Hospital, London. A memorial service was held in April at the Synagogue in which he had been married.\n\nSir Aubrey had an austere appearance, captured in Ruskin Spear's official portrait of 1966. But to those who knew him his high standards of personal and professional integrity went with a warm, kindly, humorous disposition which earned him the affection of colleagues and friends.

He was appointed as a consultant psychiatrist at the Maudsley Hospital in 1930 and became the director of the Institute of Psychiatry (IoP) in 1955, a position he held until his retirement in 1968. Lewis was an influential figure in the development of psychiatric research in the post-war period in Britain. In 1948, he helped to establish the Medical Research Council's Social Psychiatry Unit (SPU) at the Maudsley Hospital, which aimed to investigate the social and environmental factors that contribute to mental illness. He also played a crucial role in the establishment of the World Health Organization's International Pilot Study of Schizophrenia, which was conducted across ten countries between 1967 and 1979. Lewis was a prolific writer who authored numerous books and articles on a wide range of psychiatric topics, including schizophrenia, personality disorders, and the psychology of crime. His most famous book, \"The State of Psychiatry\" (1967), provided a comprehensive overview of the state of psychiatric research and practice at the time and made compelling arguments for the use of evidence-based treatments in psychiatry. In recognition of his contributions to the field of psychiatry, Lewis was awarded numerous honors and awards throughout his career. He was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Psychiatrists in 1971 and was awarded a CBE in 1963. Lewis passed away in January 1975, leaving behind a legacy of groundbreaking research and innovative thinking in the field of psychiatry. His contributions to the understanding of mental illness continue to have a profound impact on the way that mental health is treated and understood today.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 18310451}

The central portions of pegmatites are often miarolitic as the pegmatite dike crystallizes from the outside walls toward the center. The volatile portion of the magma is gradually excluded from the forming crystal phases until it becomes trapped within the body and forms the cavities which often contain minerals of elements incompatible with the typical silicate granitic mineralogy.\n\nThe miarolitic cavities and miarolitic pegmatites are sources of rare and unusual minerals containing elements not found in abundance in normal igneous rocks. Minerals containing lithium, rubidium, beryllium, boron, niobium, tantalum, tin, bismuth, fluorine and other elements can be found.\n\nThe term miarolitic comes from the Italian miarole in reference to the mineral-rich pegmatite region of Baveno and Cuasso al Monte in northern Italy.\n\nReferences\n PDF London, David, Formation of tourmaline-rich gem pockets in miarolitic pegmatites American Mineralogist, Volume 71, pages 396\u2013405, 1986\n London, David; Miarolitic Pegmatites\n\nMineralogy\nPetrology", "machine_text": "Miarolitic cavity is a type of geological formation that occurs in igneous rocks. It is a small cavity within which crystals have grown and become embedded. Miarolitic cavities are most commonly found in granite and pegmatite rocks but can also be found in other types of igneous rocks such as gabbro and syenite. The formation of miarolitic cavities occurs when the magma that formed the igneous rock begins to cool and solidify. As the magma cools, it begins to contract and pull away from the walls of the rock that it is encased in, leaving small pockets or cavities. These cavities are then filled with gas and mineral-rich fluids which solidify over time, forming crystals. Miarolitic cavities can vary in size from a few millimeters to several centimeters in diameter. The crystals that grow within the cavities can be a variety of minerals, including feldspar, quartz, and mica. These minerals can often be identified by their distinctive color and shape. Miarolitic cavities are of particular interest to geologists and mineralogists because they provide a unique opportunity to study the formation of crystals within igneous rocks. In addition, the minerals that grow within miarolitic cavities are often of high quality and can be used in various industrial applications, such as in the production of ceramics and electronic components. The term miarolitic cavity was first coined by the Swiss mineralogist Augustin-Louis Cauchy in 1829, who named the cavities after the mountain range of Miarolitic in Switzerland where they were first discovered. Today, miarolitic cavities can be found all over the world, particularly in areas with high levels of volcanic activity or areas that were once the site of ancient volcanic activity. Overall, miarolitic cavities are a fascinating geological formation that provide valuable insights into the workings of the Earth's geology and have important practical applications in various industries.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 5779230}

It is native to the south-west part of Western Australia, where it is found in a small area between Esperance and Coomalbidgup. The species was first discovered by John Stanley Beard in 1974, and was subsequently named in honor of the Western Australian botanist, Hank Olsen. Eucalyptus olsenii is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 15 meters in height and has a trunk that ranges from 30-50 cm in diameter. The bark is smooth, grey, and has patches of white. The leaves are lance-shaped and are around 6-12 cm long and 1-2 cm wide. They are dark green and have a leathery texture. The flowers are white or cream-colored and are arranged in groups of three to seven. Eucalyptus olsenii is an important species in its native range, where it plays a crucial role in providing habitat for wildlife and in stabilizing soil. It is commonly found growing in areas that are prone to erosion, and its deep roots help to stabilize the soil and prevent it from being washed away. The species is also used for timber and firewood. The conservation status of Eucalyptus olsenii is classified as 'threatened' under the Western Australian Wildlife Conservation Act 1950. This is due to habitat loss and fragmentation caused by agriculture and urbanization, as well as invasive species. Efforts are being made to protect the species and its habitat, including the establishment of conservation reserves and the implementation of weed control programs. In conclusion, Eucalyptus olsenii is an important species of tree that is found only in a small area of Western Australia.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Calgary Tigers\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Calgary Tigers, often nicknamed the Bengals, were an ice hockey team based in Calgary, Alberta, Canada from 1920 until 1927 as members of the Big-4 League, Western Canada Hockey League and Prairie Hockey League. The Tigers were revived in 1932, playing for a short-lived four years in the North Western Hockey League. They played their games at the Victoria Arena.\n\nCreated ostensibly as an amateur team in hopes of competing for the Allan Cup, the Tigers helped form the Western Canada Hockey League in 1921 to become the first major professional team in Calgary. In 1924, after winning both the league and Western Canadian championships, the Tigers became the first Calgary based club to compete for the Stanley Cup.\n\nAfter succumbing to financial pressures in 1927, the Tigers were briefly revived in the mid-1930s as a minor professional club. The Tigers competed for a total of eleven seasons in four leagues, winning four championships during their existence. Five Tigers players would later gain election to the Hockey Hall of Fame.\n\nHistory\n\nBig-4 League\nIn 1919, under the guidance of Alberta Amateur Hockey Association league president Allan McCaw, a new elite senior amateur league was established in Alberta with two teams each in Calgary and Edmonton. The Big-4 League's intention was to compete for the Allan Cup, emblematic of Canada's national senior championship. The Tigers were created in 1920, along with the Canadians, to represent Calgary in the Big Four after the city's two original teams, the Wanderers and Columbus Crew, withdrew following the league's first season.  The Tigers also faced the Edmonton Eskimos and Dominions who served as representatives of Alberta's capital.  The Calgary teams were hosted at the Victoria Arena, which had been converted into a hockey rink in 1918.\n\nWhile the Big-4 billed itself as an amateur circuit, it became known as a notorious example of a \"shamateur\" league, as amateur teams secretly employed professional players in an attempt to gain an upper hand on their competition.  When the Big Four announced their intention to compete in the Allan Cup playdowns, the Pacific Coast Hockey Association sent a letter of protest to the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association demanding that the league be declared professional, thus ineligible to compete for the Allan Cup. The Big Four ultimately chose to withdraw from the AAHA, and operated as an independent league in 1920\u201321.\n\nThe Tigers' inaugural game was played at home on December 29, 1920 as 2,500 fans saw them defeat the Edmonton Dominions 6\u20131 on the strength of a goal and two assists by Gordon Fraser.  Late in the season, the Canadians protested the use of goaltender Bill Tobin by the Edmonton Eskimos, arguing that he had not lived in Alberta long enough to be eligible per the league's residency rules. Following a last minute change of one of the arbitrators, a three-man panel denied the protest.  The decision led the front-running Tigers to refuse to play any series against the second-place Eskimos for the league championship as the team felt the Canadians' protest was improperly handled.  Efforts to reach a compromise failed as the Edmonton clubs refused to allow the protest to be reconsidered, resulting in the collapse of the league on February 24, 1921.\n\nThe Tigers remained active despite the demise of the league, playing a series of exhibition games against the Saskatoon Crescents and a team from Moose Jaw.  The Eskimos eventually agreed to face the Tigers without Tobin in an informal championship that was known as the  Intercity Championship.  The Tigers claimed the title on total-goals as they defeated Edmonton 2\u20130 in the first game at Calgary before dropping the second 2\u20131 at Edmonton.   The Tigers ended their season with a 2\u20130 exhibition loss to the defending Stanley Cup champion Ottawa Senators, who were touring the country as they travelled west to defend their title against the PCHA champion Vancouver Millionaires.\n\nWestern Canada Hockey League\n\nThe former Big Four teams joined with the Saskatoon Sheiks in forming a new professional league in 1921 that intended to compete against the National Hockey League and Pacific Coast Hockey Association. The Western Canada Hockey League was recognized as a major league and granted the right to compete for the Stanley Cup. Shortly before the inaugural season was set to begin, Calgary Canadians president Dr. C.E. Coleman and Tigers manager Eddie Poulin agreed amalgamate the two franchises under the Tigers name, allowing Calgary to present a unified front in the new league.\n\nThe Tigers played the first professional hockey game in Calgary on December 19, 1921, defeating the Regina Capitals 3\u20132 before a crowd of 3,000 fans.   The Tigers, Eskimos and Capitals battled for first place in the league, each team holding the top spot numerous times throughout the season. The Tigers and Capitals finished tied for second, forcing a two-game, total-goals playoff to determine who would meet the Eskimos for the league championship.  In the series, the Capitals defeated the Tigers 1\u20130 in Calgary, while the two teams tied 1\u20131 in Regina sending the Capitals through by a 2\u20131 aggregate total.\n\nPrior to the start of the 1922\u201323 season, the Tigers faced the Stanley Cup champion Toronto St. Patricks in two exhibition games.   They defeated the St. Pats 7\u20135 in Calgary, and again 6\u20132 in a game held in Winnipeg, Manitoba.  The WCHL and PCHA adopted an interlocking schedule for this season, with the Tigers struggling against their pacific coast opposition, winning just two of six games. Calgary finished third in the standings, behind Edmonton and Regina, as former Tiger Barney Stanley scored the winning goal against Calgary in a 2\u20131 victory by the Regina Capitals that eliminated Calgary from playoff contention. They ended the season with a 4\u20130 exhibition victory over the NHL's Ottawa Senators in a game described as one of the \"most sensational\" games ever held in Calgary.\n\nThe 1923\u201324 season began with tragedy, as Tigers' forward Foley Martin died of blood poisoning during the team's season opening road trip to the pacific coast.  The Tigers played on despite Martin's death, winning two of three games against their PCHA rivals.  The Tigers finished atop the league standings with 37 points. They met the Regina Capitals in the league championship in a two-game, total goals series. After battling Regina to a 2\u20132 draw in the Saskatchewan capital, the Tigers returned home to Calgary, capturing the championship on home ice in a 2\u20130 victory. They then moved on to face the Vancouver Maroons of the PCHA in the best-of-three Western Canadian final. After dropping the first game in Vancouver, the Tigers came back to defeat the Maroons 6\u20133 at home, and again 3\u20131 at a neutral site game in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The victory earned the Tigers the right to play for the Stanley Cup, the first such opportunity for a Calgary-based club.\n\nDespite defeating the Maroons, the PCHA champions were not eliminated. Rather, the Tigers earned a bye into the finals, while Vancouver met the Montreal Canadiens in the semi-final. The blue, blanc et rouge swept Vancouver in two games, setting the matchup for the 1924 Stanley Cup Finals where the Canadiens easily handled the Tigers. In the first game, played at Mount Royal Arena in Montreal, Canadiens rookie Howie Morenz recorded a hat trick as Montreal won 6\u20131. Due to poor ice conditions, the second game was moved to the Ottawa Auditorium in Ottawa. Led by goaltender Georges Vezina, Montreal won 3\u20130 to sweep the series, and claim the Cup.\n\nCalgary began the 1924\u201325 season with a series of exhibition games in eastern Canada.  They faced the St. Pats and Senators, proving to be a popular draw in the capital as Ottawa fans lined up for tickets for the pair of games played. Additionally, the Tigers negotiated to face the NHL's expansion Montreal Maroons if the newly constructed Montreal Forum was ready in time. Those games did not come to pass. In WCHL league play, the Tigers once again finished the regular season in first place.  Led by Oliver's team leading 20 goals, the Tigers earned a bye into the WCHL championship. Their opponent was the Victoria Cougars, who moved over to the WCHL following the collapse of the PCHA the previous summer. The Tigers were unable to earn a return trip to the Stanley Cup Finals, losing the two-game total-goals series 3\u20131.  The Cougars went on to become the last non-NHL team to win the Stanley Cup. The Tigers struggled throughout the 1925\u201326 season, languishing in last place for most of the season until a 2\u20130 victory over Victoria on the last day of the season moved Calgary one point ahead of Vancouver to end the season.\n\nThe financial pressures of trying to keep up with rapidly escalating salaries took its toll on the league.  The prairie clubs, including the Tigers, were struggling under financial hardships while a mild winter of 1925\u201326 reduced the quality of the natural ice at Victoria arena which, coupled with the team's poor performance, reduced attendance.  Manager Lance Turner confirmed on May 4, 1926 that the Tigers were sold to the National Hockey League, along with the franchises in Edmonton, Regina, Victoria, Vancouver and Portland, and that the league had ceased operations. The six franchises were sold for $300,000.\n\nTurner immediately began efforts to form a new team and league that would operate as a \"class B\" league, one level below the NHL. Three weeks after the collapse of the Western League, the Tigers were reformed as a charter member of the five team Prairie Hockey League. The team struggled to attract fans in the Prairie League, and consequently announced late in the season that it would cease operations after one year. The Tigers were successful on the ice, however, as they finished atop the league standings and met the Saskatoon Sheiks in a best-of-three series for the league title. Calgary dropped the first game, 2\u20131 in Saskatoon, but tied the series with a 2\u20131 victory in Calgary on the strength of two goals in the last five minutes by Andy Aikenhead. The Tigers were then awarded the league championship after the Sheiks defaulted the third game, refusing to play in opposition to the referee assigned for the deciding game. As Prairie champions, the Tigers traveled east to face the Winnipeg Maroons for the western Canadian professional championship. Calgary won the first game, then were awarded the title after the Maroons were unable to play the second game when the American Hockey Association rescheduled their league playoff series and created a conflict. The Tigers ended their season with exhibition games in the United States before the team was disbanded.\n\nNorth Western Hockey League\n\nIn 1932, the Tigers were revived as a charter franchise of a reformed, minor-professional, Western Canada Hockey League. They opened the season with a 1\u20130 defeat in Edmonton on December 7, 1932 in what was the first professional game for either city in six years, while a near capacity crowd of 4,100 fans witnessed a 7\u20130 victory by the Tigers over the Eskimos two nights later in Calgary. The Tigers finished the season in first place with on the strength of giving up the fewest goals against during the season, but struggled to attract fans.  Attendance declined throughout the season to a low of just 560 for their victory over Saskatoon in early March that clinched the league's top record.  Overall, the team averaged 2,270 fans per game. Having earned a bye to the championship series, the Tigers faced the Eskimos in a best-of-five series marred by poor ice caused unseasonably warm weather in both cities. Following a 1\u20131 tie in the first game at Calgary, the league ordered the remaining games of the series be played in Edmonton due to the poor condition of the ice surface. The second game was also tied at 1 after bad ice in Edmonton forced it to be ended early. Two victories for the Eskimos pushed Calgary to the brink of elimination before the Tigers rebounded with a 5\u20131 victory in the fifth game.  The ties earlier in the series forced the teams to a sixth game that also went to overtime tied at 1 before the Eskimos scored to win the championship after four minutes of an extra period.\n\nThe league reformed as the North Western Hockey League following the season after the Saskatchewan clubs dropped out and were replaced with three teams on the Pacific Coast.  Calgary again won the regular-season title in 1933\u201334, advancing directly to the league championship, on the strength of a 12\u20133 victory over the Vancouver Lions in the final game of the regular season. Dutch Gainor won the league scoring title with 43 points. Fearing a repeat of the previous season's playoff disaster, the league ordered Calgary to play their championship series against the Lions in Seattle and Vancouver as both cities had arenas capable of making artificial ice. The disadvantage did not affect the Tigers in the opening game of the series, a 5\u20132 victory at Seattle. The teams traded victories in the next three contests, ending in a 2\u20131 Vancouver win in the fourth game that tied the series at 2 wins apiece. Calgary won the championship with a 6\u20131 victory before a Vancouver crowd of over 6,000 fans.\n\nThe 1934 championship would prove to be the Tigers' last hurrah, as the team fell to the bottom of the NWHL standings in 1934\u201335, winning only three games. They once again finished in last place in 1935\u201336 and were embroiled in another disputer with Edmonton over the rights to a player as the Eskimos claimed they had gained the rights to Tony Savage from the Montreal Canadiens though he had already been sent to Calgary on loan.  The Tigers issued an ultimatum to the league, threatening to disband for the season if Savage did not remain in Calgary. Savage ultimately remained with Calgary for the entire season.\n\n1936 proved to be the final year for the Tigers, as the Great Depression and declining interest in professional hockey in favour of the senior game had threatened the team's viability. After the Eskimos announced intentions to relocate to Victoria, British Columbia as part of a realignment of the league, Tigers' manager Clair Manning contemplated relocating the franchise to Spokane, Washington. The team instead hoped to operate for another season in Calgary, but met its final demise after the NWHL reformed into the Pacific Coast Hockey League for 1936\u201337 and denied the Tigers' application to join the new league.\n\nSeason-by-season record\nNote: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, Pts = Points, GF = Goals for, GA = Goals against\n\n\u2020Denotes Tigers' record when the league collapsed.  Exhibition games played after are not included\n\nHall of Famers\n\nThe WCHL's short and unstable existence was a result of salary escalation caused by having three leagues competing for top talent. As a result, by the mid-1920s, hockey players were among the highest paid athletes in North America, with top players able to demand even higher salaries than the top baseball stars of the time. Though the WCHL lasted only five years, the Tigers boasted five future Hockey Hall of Famers on their roster during that time.\n\nBarney Stanley, a former PCHA star, spent two seasons with the Tigers from 1920\u201322. Joining the Tigers in the last season of the Big Four League, he once again turned pro when the Tigers joined the WCHL.  Stanley led the Tigers in scoring with 26 goals in 1921\u201322 before being traded to Regina.  Red Dutton, a World War I veteran who refused doctors orders to have his leg amputated after suffering a shrapnel wound, played 123 games with the Tigers before moving to the NHL where he played 449 more with the Montreal Maroons and New York Americans.  Rusty Crawford, a former standout in the National Hockey Association and National Hockey League before the war, spent three seasons in Calgary from 1922\u201325.  Crawford recorded 19 goals in 64 games as a Tiger.\n\nHerb Gardiner began his professional career in Calgary in 1920, remaining with the Tigers until he was sold to the Montreal Canadiens in 1926, where he would go on to win the Hart Memorial Trophy as NHL Most Valuable Player in 1927.  Harry Oliver also began his pro career in Calgary, playing with the Tigers from 1921\u201326 where he scored 90 goals before being sold to the Boston Bruins. Oliver would go on to play eleven seasons in the NHL with the Bruins and New York Americans.\n\nHead coaches\nBarney Stanley (1921\u201322)\nHerb Gardiner (1922\u201326)\n\nLegacy\nThe uniform of the Calgary Tigers served as the inspiration for the \"vintage\" uniform of the Calgary Flames which was worn in the Heritage Classic game in February 2011. While the Calgary Flames do not trace their ancestry back to the Tigers (the Atlanta Flames club was purchased by Calgary businessmen in the 1980s), the organization had wanted to recognize the first professional hockey club in Calgary history for this event and selected the colourful uniforms of the Tigers.\n\nSee also\nList of ice hockey teams in Alberta\nIce hockey in Calgary\nCalgary Cowboys\nCalgary Flames\n\nReferences\n\nFootnotes\n\nGeneral\n\nDefunct ice hockey teams in Canada\nTigers, Calgary\nIce hockey teams in Alberta\nIce hockey clubs established in 1920\n1920 establishments in Alberta", "machine_text": "Calgary Tigers were a professional ice hockey team that played in the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL) from 1920 to 1926. The team was known for its immensely talented players and successful campaigns, which saw them win multiple championships and establish a strong fan base. Founded in 1920, the Tigers played their home games at Victoria Arena in Calgary, Alberta. The team was owned by George B. Noonan, who also served as the team's first coach. Noonan was succeeded as coach by Alf Smith, a former NHL player, in 1923. Smith led the team to further success, winning three consecutive championships from 1924 to 1926. The Tigers boasted a roster of notable players, including Eddie Shore, Duke Keats, and Red Dutton. Shore, in particular, was a standout player and would go on to have a Hall of Fame career in the NHL. Meanwhile, Keats was known for his offensive prowess, becoming the first player in professional hockey to tally over 100 points in a season. Despite their successes, the Tigers faced financial difficulties, which led to the team's demise in 1926. The team was sold and became the American Hockey Association's Chicago Cardinals.

Sean Richard Bianchi Carneiro Ribeiro Goldman was born in the year 2000 in the United States, to an American father and Brazilian mother. In 2004, at the age of four years, Sean went to Brazil with his mother for a 2-week vacation. However, his mother refused to return to the United States.

She then married Brazilian lawyer Jo\u00e3o Paulo Lins e Silva in 2007, and subsequently died while giving birth to their child in 2008. After Bruna's death, the Brazilian husband obtained a custody order for the child from the Brazilian courts by failing to inform them of Bruna's death and requesting a new Brazilian birth certificate be issued that listed himself as the father under the Brazilian concept of socio-affective paternity, on the basis of which, he refused to return the boy to David Goldman, Sean's father. Based on a decision of Brazil's Supreme Court, Sean was handed over to his father on December 24, 2009. As of January, 2010, his Brazilian family was hoping to regain custody.

The case gained significant media attention and sparked a legal battle that lasted for over five years. In June 2004, Bruna Bianchi, Sean Goldman's mother, took him to Brazil for a two-week vacation and never returned. Sean's father, David Goldman, was left with no choice but to petition the Brazilian government to seek the return of his son to the United States. Brazil is known for its complex and bureaucratic legal system, and David's fight for custody of his son was long and arduous. The Brazilian courts initially granted Bianchi custody of Sean. However, David filed an appeal against this decision and continued to fight for custody. The case eventually caught the attention of United States lawmakers, including then-Senator Frank Lautenberg, who introduced a bill that called for the immediate return of Sean to his father in the United States. The case also garnered attention from international organizations like the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. After years of legal battles, David was finally granted custody of Sean in December 2009, when the Brazilian Supreme Court ruled that Sean should be returned to his father in the United States. In a dramatic television moment, David was reunited with his son at the U.S. consulate in Rio de Janeiro on Christmas Day. Since then, the Goldman child abduction case has become a landmark case in international child custody disputes.

He was born in Cento, near Bologna, Italy, and received his early training from his father, Domenico Gennari, who was also a well-known painter. Bartolomeo Gennari is known for his work in both painting and sculpture, but he is perhaps best known for his religious paintings and frescoes. His paintings often featured dramatic and emotional scenes from the Bible, and his use of light and shadow created a sense of depth and movement that drew viewers into the scene. One of Gennari's most famous works is the fresco cycle in the Chapel of the Crucifix in the Church of San Giuseppe in Cento. This cycle, which was painted in the mid-17th century, depicts scenes from the life of Jesus and the Passion of Christ, and is considered one of the masterpieces of Italian Baroque art. Gennari also created several notable sculptures, including a bronze statue of St. John the Evangelist for the Basilica of San Petronio in Bologna. This statue was commissioned by the Bentivoglio family, one of the most powerful families in Bologna at the time, and is considered a masterpiece of Baroque sculpture. In addition to his work as a painter and sculptor, Gennari was also an accomplished architect and designed several churches and palaces in and around Bologna. He was a member of the Accademia Clementina, an association of artists and scholars in Bologna, and was highly respected in his lifetime. Today, Gennari's work can be seen in museums and churches throughout Italy, and his influence on Baroque art and architecture can still be felt today. His legacy as one of the great artists of the 17th century is secure, and his work continues to inspire and delight art lovers around the world.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 43674209}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Don't Be Cruel\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "\"Don't Be Cruel\" is a song recorded by Elvis Presley and written by Otis Blackwell in 1956.  It was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2002.  In 2004, it was listed #197 in Rolling Stone's list of 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. The song is currently ranked as the 173rd greatest song of all time, as well as the sixth best song of 1956, by Acclaimed Music.\n\nElvis Presley\n\nRecording\n\"Don't Be Cruel\" was the first song that Presley's song publishers, Hill and Range, brought to him to record. Blackwell was more than happy to give up 50% of the royalties and a co-writing credit to Presley to ensure that the \"hottest new singer around covered it\". But unfortunately he had already sold the song for only $25, as he stated in an interview of American Songwriter.\n\nFreddy Bienstock, Presley's music publisher, gave the following explanation for why Presley received co-writing credit for songs like \"Don't Be Cruel\". \"In the early days Elvis would show dissatisfaction with some lines and he would make alterations, so it wasn't just what is known as a 'cut-in'. His name did not appear after the first year. But if Presley liked the song, the writers would be offered a guarantee of a million records and they would surrender a third of their royalties to Elvis'.\"\n\nPresley recorded the song on July 2, 1956 during an exhaustive recording session at RCA studios in New York City. During this session he also recorded \"Hound Dog\", and \"Any Way You Want Me\". The song featured Presley's regular band of Scotty Moore on lead guitar (with Presley usually providing rhythm guitar), Bill Black on bass, D. J. Fontana on drums, and backing vocals from the Jordanaires. The producing credit was given to RCA's Stephen H. Sholes, although the studio recordings reveal that Presley produced the songs in this session by selecting the song, reworking the arrangement on piano, and insisting on 28 takes before he was satisfied with it. He also ran through 31 takes of \"Hound Dog\".\n\nRelease\nThe single was released on July 13, 1956 backed with \"Hound Dog\". Within a few weeks \"Hound Dog\" had risen to #2 on the Pop charts with sales of over one million. Soon after it was overtaken by \"Don't Be Cruel\" which took #1 on all three main charts; Pop, Country, and R 'n' B. Between them, both songs remained at #1 on the Pop chart for a run of 11 weeks tying it with the 1950 Anton Karas hit \"The Third Man Theme\" and the 1951/1952 Johnnie Ray hit \"Cry\" for the longest stay at number one by a single record from late 1950 onward until 1992's smash \"End of the Road\" by Boyz II Men. By the end of 1956 it had sold in excess of four million copies. Billboard ranked it as the No. 2 song for 1956.\n\nPresley performed \"Don't Be Cruel\" during all three of his appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show in September 1956 and January 1957.\n\nIn the United Kingdom it remained a B-side, but was posthumously a hit in its own right, reaching number 24 in the UK Singles Chart in 1978.\n\nLegacy\n\n\"Don't Be Cruel\" went on to become Presley's biggest selling single recorded in 1956, with sales over six million by 1961.

He was the second child and eldest son of eight children born to Hugh Seymour, 6th Marquess of Hertford (1843\u20131912) and the Hon. Mary Hood.  His siblings were Lady Margaret Alice Seymour (1869\u20131901) whose married name became a Ismay, Lady Emily Mary Seymour (1873\u20131948), Lady Victoria Frederica Wilhelmina Georgina Seymour (1874\u20131960), Lady Jane Edith Seymour (b. 1877), Lord Henry Charles Seymour (1878\u20131939), who married Lady Helen Grosvenor, a daughter of the 1st Duke of Westminster, Lord Edward Beauchamp Seymour (1879\u20131917), and Lord George Frederick Seymour (1881\u20131940).\n\nHis paternal grandparents were Francis Seymour, 5th Marquess of Hertford, and Lady Emily Murray, daughter of David Murray, 3rd Earl of Mansfield.

He settled in Mackay, growing sugar cane and bananas, but quickly created great animosity, due to being a dishonest employer: he was sued by a labourer (who won the case) for underpayment, and boasted tricking kanakas who purchased his chickens into thinking gold sovereigns were less valuable than silver half crowns.\n\nHe was noted for all-male house parties at his isolated residence 'The Rocks' near Mackay, and achieved notoriety for \"skirt dancing\" in a sequinned outfit with butterfly wings, as one newspaper phrased it: \"gyrating in the fluffy serpentine dance before a Kanaka audience... His legs being tough and skinny his audience show little inclination to pot him as long pig.\"  When he returned to England in 1897, a Mackay newspaper noted the citizens were \"more interested in his departure\" than his arrival.\n\nFrom 1889 to 1894, he served in the Black Watch and was a Lieutenant in the Warwickshire Imperial Yeomanry.

She was internationally renowned for her art.  In 1987, Judith was enrolled at the Creative Growth Art Center in Oakland, California which supports people with developmental disabilities. There, Judith discovered her passion and talent for abstract fiber art and she was able to communicate in a new form. An account of Scott's life, Entwined: Sisters and Secrets in the Silent World of Artist Judith Scott (2016) has been written by her twin sister.\n\nBiography\nJudith was born into a middle-class family in Cincinnati, Ohio in May 1, 1943 along with her fraternal twin sister Joyce. Unlike Joyce, Judith was born with Down Syndrome. During her infancy, Judith suffered from Scarlet Fever, which caused her to lose her hearing, a fact that remained unknown until much later on in her life.\n\nJudith Scott spent her first seven and a half years at home with her parents, twin sister and older brothers. Although the developmental gap between the two girls was apparent, \"the parents consciously sought to treat these youngest members of the family alike.\"\n\nHowever, when it was time for the girls to start attending school, Judith was found to be \"ineducable.\" There was only one classroom for children with disabilities, and Judith was not able to pass the verbally-based entrance tests, due to her still undiagnosed deafness. Consequently, on medical advice, her parents placed Judith in the Columbus State Institution (formerly the Columbus State School), an institution for the mentally disabled, on October 18, 1950. This separation had a profound effect on both twins.\n\nThe records from Judith Scott's first few years at the Institution indicate that she had an IQ of 30 (based upon oral testing before her deafness was recognized). For this reason she was denied any training opportunities. Deprived of her twin, Judith became severely alienated, and behavioral problems soon surfaced. Her Clinical Record states that \"She does not seem to be in good contact with her environment. She does not get along well with other children, is restless, eats messily, tears her clothing, and beats other children. Her presence on the ward is a disturbing influence.\" Soon after, she was moved to a smaller state institution at Gallipolis, Ohio.\n\nIn 1985, after 35 years of complete separation and lengthy and difficult negotiations, Joyce Scott became her sister's legal guardian, and brought Judith to live with her in California, a state where all mentally disabled citizens are entitled to an ongoing education.\n\nJudith Scott died of natural causes at her sister's home in Dutch Flat, California, a few weeks short of her 62nd birthday. She outlived her life expectancy at birth by almost fifty years.\n\nArt\nOn April 1, 1987, Judith Scott began attending the Creative Growth Art Center in Oakland, one of the first organizations in the world to provide studio space for artists with disabilities. For almost two years, Judith showed little interest in any artistic activity. She was unexceptional with paint. She scribbled loops and circles, but her work contained no representational imagery, and she was so uninterested in creating that the staff was considering ending her involvement with the program.\n\nIt wasn't until Judith casually observed a fiber art class conducted by visiting artist Sylvia Seventy, that she had her artistic breakthrough. Using the materials at hand, Judith spontaneously invented her own unique and radically different form of artistic expression. While other students were stitching, she was sculpting with an unprecedented zeal and concentration.\n\nHer creative gifts and absolute focus were quickly recognized, and she was given complete freedom to choose her own materials. Taking whatever objects she found, regardless of ownership, she would wrap them in carefully selected colored yarns to create diverse sculptures of many different shapes. Some resemble cocoons or body parts, while others are elongated totemic poles. Many of her works also feature pairs, reflecting Scott's experience as a twin. Judith worked on her art five days a week for eighteen years, producing over 200 pieces in total.\n\nJudith had her first exhibition in 1999, which coincided with the publication of John MacGregor's book Metamorphosis: The Fiber Art of Judith Scott. Together, these events helped propel her to worldwide recognition.\n\nCollections \nScott's work has become immensely popular in the world of outsider art, and her pieces sell for substantial sums. Scott is now hailed as a contemporary artist, no longer just an outsider. Her art is held in the permanent collections of many museums, including:  Museum of Modern Art (Manhattan, New York), the American Visionary Art Museum (Baltimore, Maryland), San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Museum of American Folk Art (Manhattan, New York), Intuit: The Center for Intuitive and Outsider Art (Chicago, Illinois), Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin, The Oakland Museum, Oakland, CA.

It wasn't until she was 42 years old that she was discovered by her twin sister, Joyce, who became her guardian and introduced her to the creative arts community at the Creative Growth Art Center in Oakland, California. Scott began creating art at Creative Growth in 1987 and quickly gained recognition for her ability to transform everyday materials into complex abstract sculptures. Her work has been exhibited in museums and galleries worldwide, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Venice Biennale, and the American Folk Art Museum. Scott's sculptures often display a tension between chaos and order, with intricate layering of materials creating a sense of depth and complexity. Her work has been described as a metaphor for the human experience, with the layers of fibers representing the complexities of our emotions and inner selves. Scott's artistic process was highly intuitive and she worked without any preconceived ideas or plans. She would spend hours, sometimes days, wrapping and binding fibers onto whatever object she had chosen as her base. Her sculptures often incorporated found objects such as chairs or bicycles, which added another layer of meaning to her work. Scott became one of the most celebrated artists with disabilities of all time, and her work has inspired countless artists and art enthusiasts around the world. Her legacy lives on through the Judith Scott Memorial Fund, which supports artists with disabilities and promotes their inclusion in the art world.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1433917}

The editors of The Handbook of British Chronology have placed his date of accession between 879 and 889 and his death between 890 and 896 with a terminal end date of 900. This date is confirmed by the fact that Asser, Wulfsige's successor, was signing charters as bishop of Sherborne in 900.

The copy sent to Wulfsige, which includes his name in the preface, survives as MS Ii.2.4 at Cambridge University Library. It is one of only five which are extant today and was the original from which copies were made in the eleventh century.\n\nWhen Werferth, bishop of Worcester, translated Gregory's Dialogues into English, Alfred sent an exemplar to Wulfsige, who composed a poem that was included as a preface to the work.

During his tenure as bishop, Wulfsige is believed to have been involved in efforts to reform the Church in England. This included promoting the observance of canonical laws and improving the morality of the clergy. He was also known for his efforts to promote education, particularly among the clergy and the nobility. In 1012, Wulfsige was forced to flee Sherborne when the town was attacked by Danish Vikings. He is believed to have sought refuge in the nearby town of Winchester, where he continued to serve as a bishop until his death in 1023. Despite the challenges he faced during his tenure as bishop, Wulfsige is remembered as an important figure in the history of the Church in England. His commitment to education and moral reform helped pave the way for future developments in the Church, and his leadership during a difficult period in England's history demonstrated his strength as a bishop and a spiritual leader.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 13112783}

Steele, which feature the landscape of Brown County, Indiana. The paintings are located on the Eskenazi Health campus, near downtown Indianapolis, Indiana, and are part of the Eskenazi Health Art Collection.\n\nDescription \nFour Seasons is a series of four oil on canvas murals - Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter - painted in 1914 by Indiana artist T.C. Steele, which feature the landscape of Brown County, Indiana. Often regarded as the \"pioneer of Indiana landscape paintings,\" Steele, in his signature \"agreeable impressionistic style,\" used color, light, and brushwork to capture the experience of each season in southern Indiana. In 1917, Alfred M. Brooks, in his article \"The Art and Work of Theodore Steele,\" featured in The American Magazine of Art, wrote that the Four Seasons murals feature \"...lovely echoes of light and shade, made to play over, and to accentuate, rather than conceal, the highly representative character of the details which make up the purely pictorial nature of the subjects, these 'Seasons' are masterly and, decoratively masterful. They bespeak the inherent bigness and breadth of the scenes they represent so faithfully.\"\n\nHistorical information \n\nThe Four Seasons murals were created as part of the 1914 City Hospital Mural Project in Indianapolis, Indiana. In 1911, Indianapolis City Hospital expanded by adding two dedicated patient buildings, the Burdsal Units. St. Margaret\u2019s Hospital Guild, a local women\u2019s volunteer group dedicated to supporting the City Hospital, donated money for decoration of the new wards, which resulted in the world's first large-scale mural project in a public hospital. Sixteen of Indiana\u2019s \u201cfinest and most promising\u201d artists, including Steele, were invited to contribute to the mural project. Despite the limited budget, Steele and the other artists committed to completing the project for the wages of a union house painter, approximately $75\u2013100 per month.\n\nWhile the majority of artists worked on-site at the hospital, Steele painted the Four Seasons murals at his home, \"The House of the Singing Winds,\" in Brown County, Indiana. Because the canvases and frameworks were so large, and his existing studio could not accommodate the space required, Steele painted the murals in his living room. In late 1914, before they were installed in the hospital, the Four Seasons murals were exhibited at the Herron Art Institute. Upon arrival at City Hospital, the four canvases were mounted to patient ward walls using a mixture of white lead and damar varnish. Once hung, the adhesive was further secured by covering the completed murals with thick layers of varnish.\n\nConservation \nIn 1967, imminent renovation plans for the Burdsal units endangered the mural collection. Through a campaign organized by St. Margaret's Hospital Guild, Steele's murals were slated for conservation by the James G. Snodgrass Studio. The four murals were removed from the building's walls, mounted to masonite, restored, and displayed at the Indiana State Museum. With building renovations complete, in 1976, three of Steele's murals - Spring, Summer, and Autumn - were returned to the hospital, where they hung in conference rooms. The fourth mural, Winter, was gifted to the museum as a gesture of gratitude for the works' safekeeping.\n\nLocation \nThe Four Seasons mural fragments were reunited with the 2013 opening of a new Sidney and Lois Eskenazi Hospital campus and are part of the Eskenazi Health Art Collection. Winter is on loan for 99 years from the Indiana State Museum. The Four Seasons mural fragments are located in The Rapp Family Conference Center: Steele Corridor on the first floor of the Sidney & Lois Eskenazi Hospital and are \"Dedicated with gratitude, The Penrod Society.\u201d\n\nArtist \n\nTheodore Clement Steele (1847-1926) was an Impressionist painter known for his portraits and Indiana landscape paintings. Born and raised in Indiana, he studied at the Royal Academy when he and his family moved to Munich in 1879. Steele returned to Indiana in 1885 and was part of a group of well-known Indiana artists, the Hoosier Group. Among others, Steele\u2019s work is included at the Haan Mansion Museum of Indiana Art, Indiana State Museum, Indianapolis Museum of Art, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and the Indiana University Art Museum in Bloomington, Indiana.\n\nSee also \n Eskenazi Health Art Collection\n Sidney & Lois Eskenazi Hospital\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n Eskenazi Health Art Installations (video)\n\nEskenazi Health Art Collection\n1914 paintings", "machine_text": "Four Seasons is a collection of four murals painted by the renowned American artist, Alphonse Mucha. The murals depict four different seasons of the year - spring, summer, autumn, and winter. They were commissioned by a businessman named Charles Richard Crane, who planned to use them in a pavilion at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893. The murals are a mix of Art Nouveau and Symbolist styles and are some of Mucha's earliest works. Each mural is created on a canvas measuring 6.5 meters high and 4.5 meters wide. The murals are rich in detail, and much attention has been paid to the nuances of each season. The Spring mural depicts a group of nymphs basking in the sunlight, surrounded by tulips, crocuses, and other spring flowers. The Summer mural showcases a scene of a woman with a sickle standing in a field of wheat, with the sun setting behind her. The Autumn mural depicts a woman picking grapes, surrounded by vineyards and the fruits of harvest. Finally, the Winter mural features a woman sitting in a snowy landscape with a bare tree behind her. After the World's Columbian Exposition, the murals were purchased by the Art Institute of Chicago, where they remain on display to this day. They have become some of the most popular and beloved artworks in the museum's collection.

Natama was a student at the University of Ouagadougou in the 1970s and was involved in various student organizations promoting political activism. He became a well-known leader of the Burkinab\u00e9 left-wing group, and his political theories focused on African socialism, Marxism, and anti-colonialism. Natama was imprisoned several times during his lifetime due to his political activism. He used these imprisonments as an opportunity to promote his political beliefs and increase his support amongst the common people of Burkina Faso. His teachings started to gain ground, and he accumulated a large following. Due to his activism, Natama was frequently targeted by the government, but he remained committed to his cause and continued his political activities. In August 1983, Natama and President Thomas Sankara led a popular insurrection, also known as the Burkinab\u00e9 Revolution, which overthrew the regime of Jean-Baptiste Ouedraogo. Natama was one of the key figures in this revolution and was instrumental in the formation of the National Revolutionary Council (CNR). However, in 1986, Natama was removed from his role as Minister of National Security in the CNR and relocated to an agricultural project in the north of the country. Toussaint Natama passed away in Ouagadougou on March 9, 1993, at the age of 44. His legacy remains in Burkinab\u00e9 political circles, where he is still recognized as a hero and a pioneer of Burkinab\u00e9 socialism.

He was also known for his bravery and speed, which made him an ideal patron for horse racing.

The worship of Hippotes was widespread throughout ancient Greece, especially among those who were involved in horse racing. He was often invoked during races to ensure a successful outcome. In addition to horse racing, Hippotes was also associated with journeys across the sea. Sailors would often pray to him for safe passage through treacherous waters. It was believed that Hippotes could calm storms and turbulent seas, and guide ships to safe harbors. Despite Hippotes' popularity, there are few stories that recount his adventures and exploits. However, his name lives on in modern-day equestrian events, where Hippotes is still celebrated as the patron saint of horse racing.

Born in the city of Aalen, Kieser studied medicine at the University of Jena, where he was a pupil of the renowned naturalist and philosopher Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. After completing his studies, Kieser worked as a physician and teacher in several German cities, including Frankfurt, W\u00fcrzburg, and Erlangen. Kieser's most important contribution to the field of anatomy was his work on the structure and function of the nervous system. He produced numerous studies on the spinal cord, cranial nerves, and brain, which advanced the understanding of the anatomy and physiology of these structures. He was particularly interested in the relationship between the brain and behavior, and his work laid the foundation for the modern science of neuropsychology. In addition to his anatomical work, Kieser was also a pioneer in the field of pathological anatomy. He conducted extensive studies of diseased tissue and organs, which helped to establish the fundamental principles of modern pathology. One of his most significant contributions was his work on the pathology of tuberculosis, a disease that was then epidemic in Europe. Kieser described the characteristic changes that occur in the lungs of individuals with tuberculosis, and his work laid the foundation for the later development of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for the disease. Kieser's work was widely recognized during his lifetime, and he was elected to several scientific societies, including the Royal Society of London and the Royal Academy of Sciences in Berlin. He published numerous scientific papers and several important books, including a textbook of anatomy that was widely used in German medical schools for many years. Today, Kieser is remembered as one of the most important figures in the history of medical science, whose contributions to the understanding of the human body laid the foundations for modern medicine.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 9685012}

The interior has a typical side hall plan, with a front parlor, behind which are a sitting room and kitchen. Its upper floors have similar arrangements of rooms. The house was Charles Sumner's home for thirty years.\n\nCharles Sumner was born to abolitionist parents, and was educated at Harvard College, where he studied law under Joseph Story. Sumner became politically active in the fight against slavery in the 1840s, when he also gained a reputation as an orator. He helped found the abolitionist Free Soil Party in 1848, under whose banner he won election to the United States Senate in 1851. This marked the beginning of a more vocal and aggressive opposition to slavery in the political halls of Washington, D.C. His searing verbal reprobation of his opponents escalated into violence when he was beaten unconscious on the floor of the Senate by South Carolina Representative Preston Brooks in 1856, an event that emotionally polarized the country. After Sumner's recovery, he returned to the Senate, where he played a leading role as a Radical Republican during the American Civil War, as an advocate of emancipation. After the war he championed civil rights for free slaves during the Reconstruction Era, and played a role in the impeachment of President Andrew Johnson.\n\nThe house was designated a National Historic Landmark and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.\n\nImages\n\nSee also\n List of National Historic Landmarks in Boston\n National Register of Historic Places listings in northern Boston, Massachusetts\n\nReferences\n\nHouses completed in 1806\nNational Historic Landmarks in Boston\nHouses in Boston\nBeacon Hill, Boston\nHistoric district contributing properties in Massachusetts\nHouses on the National Register of Historic Places in Suffolk County, Massachusetts\nNational Register of Historic Places in Boston\nSumner family", "machine_text": "Charles Sumner House is a historic house located in the Beacon Hill neighborhood of Boston.

Sir Roy Fedden, the company's principal designer, developed the 14-cylinder radial Mercury engine during this period. The company was taken over by the Bristol Aeroplane Company in 1920.\n\nCompany origins\nIn 1918 the Anglo-American company Cosmos bought Straker-Squire (also known as Brazil Straker), a car and bus manufacturing firm which had branched out into aircraft engine repair and manufacture. This began by first reconditioning, then substantially redesigning and re-manufacturing Curtiss OX-5 engines. Due to the quality of this work, they were the only company permitted to manufacture Rolls-Royce aircraft engines under licence, building Hawk and Falcon engines, major components for the Eagle engine and also 600 Renault 80hp 8Ca engines. Over 1,500 engines were produced in total. The company was one of the first to be brought under Admiralty control, and Fedden and his draughtsman Leonard Butler designed two engines during the war; the 14-cylinder Mercury and the larger, 9-cylinder Jupiter.\n\nAero-engine range\n\nIn 1919 the range consisted of the 450\u00a0hp Jupiter, the 300\u00a0hp Mercury and the smaller 100\u00a0hp Lucifer. On 9 April 1919 a Bristol Scout F fitted with a Mercury engine set two British records at Farnborough achieving the time to 10,000\u00a0ft and 20,000\u00a0ft records.\n\nCar production\nDespite selling off the engineering side of Brazil Straker, which continued to successfully build cars, Cosmos Engineering also produced a small number of Fedden-designed cars. The Cosmos 10.5 of 1919, featured an air cooled 3cyl radial layout 994cc engine of 16\u00a0hp and was significantly innovative for its time. Only a limited number were made, and it was followed up by the larger 10.5 CAR which never got beyond prototype stage.\n\nFate\nSoon afterwards the company went into liquidation and was taken over by the Bristol Aeroplane Company in 1920. Operations then moved to a former flying school located on the northern edge of Filton Aerodrome. The factory on Lodge Causeway was subsequently taken over by Parnall & Sons for shop and ship fitting and aircraft component manufacturing.\n\nSee also\n\nReferences\n\nNotes\n\nBibliography\n\n Bartlett, John Images of England, Fishponds Tempus 2004 \n Culshaw, David & Horrobin, Peter The Complete Catalogue of British Cars Veloce 1997 \n Lumsden, Alec.

It is considered a multidisciplinary field that incorporates various aspects of engineering, including mechanical, electrical, aerospace, and computer engineering. The origins of Cosmos Engineering can be traced to the mid-20th century, during the dawn of the Space Age. It was during this time that human beings first began to venture beyond Earth and explore the cosmos. Engineers were tasked with designing spacecraft, rockets, and other systems that could withstand the harsh conditions of space and enable scientific exploration of celestial bodies such as the moon, Mars, and beyond. Over the years, Cosmos Engineering has expanded to include a wide range of sub-disciplines such as astrodynamics, space robotics, materials science, propulsion systems, and spacecraft design. These technologies have been used for numerous space missions, including manned and unmanned exploration of the solar system, Earth observation, and satellite communication. One of the latest trends in Cosmos Engineering is the development of space tourism. Companies such as SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Virgin Galactic are working towards making suborbital and orbital space flights accessible to civilians. Cosmos Engineering has played a significant role in achieving this goal, as it has enabled the design of reusable rockets and spacecraft that can carry passengers safely into space and back to Earth. Cosmos Engineering has made significant contributions to various scientific fields, including astronomy, physics, and planetary science. With the increasing interest in space exploration and research, Cosmos Engineering is expected to continue to grow as a field, and its impact on our understanding of the universe is likely to increase in the future.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 3862757}

The CD release party was held at the Phantasy Nite Club in Cleveland, and featured haunted house actors performing choreographed mini-scenes.\n\nReception \nHorror magazine, Rue Morgue, called the album \"a return to the more gothic flavourings\" of the band's 1999 release, Realm of Shadows, with Mike Ventarola of the gothic music magazine Legends adding that the album \"brings listeners through many layers of a storyline, not by spoken prose but through inflections and nuances of sound that create a wordless script.\"\n\nIn the haunted attraction industry where Midnight Syndicate's music was used in haunted houses and at amusement parks like Cedar Point, Universal Studios Florida, Paramount Parks, and Six Flags, Jim O'Rear of Underground Entertainment Magazine lauded the album's blend of gothic atmosphere and classical music adding that it, and the band's previous releases, were the most commonly used albums in the haunted attraction industry.\n\nThe album also saw the band's popularity in the role-playing game industry expand with Gene Vogel of National Gamers Guild lamenting that adding music to role-playing games hadn't been explored much to that point while praising the album's suitability for use in table top games. A review in Gothic Beauty Magazine called it the \"perfect accompaniment for Live action role-playing games (LARPs) and RPGs.\"\n\nOn September 11, 2009, AOL Radio released a list of the Top 10 Best Halloween Music CDs as ranked by AOL/CBS Radio listeners.

This allows conversational use of text, much like a hearing person can listen to someone speaking in real-time.\n\nCaptioned telephony \nCaptioned telephony is the streaming of real-time text captions in parallel with speech on a phone call.  This is used by people who are hard of hearing to allow them to have the full benefit of listening as best they can, hearing all the intonation etc. in speech, yet have the captions for those words they cannot hear clearly enough.  In the United States, captioned telephony is one of the free relay services that is available to anyone who is hard-of-hearing. Originally developed for use on the analog phone systems (where it requires a special phone) it is now available over IP using standard devices.\n\nUse in collaboration \nCollaborative real-time editing is the utilization of real-time text for shared editing, rather than for conversation. Split screen chat, where conversational text appears continuously, is also considered real-time text. Some examples that provide this as a service are Apache Wave and its fork SwellRT, Etherpad, the editor Gobby, and most notably Google Docs.\n\nCaptioning, transcriptions and other uses \nReal-time text is used in closed captioning and when captions are being streamed live continuously during live events. Transcription services including Communication Access Real-Time Translation and TypeWell frequently use real-time text, where text is streamed live to a remote display. This is used in court reporting, and is also used by deaf attendees at a conference. Also, real-time text provides an enhancement to text messaging on mobile phones, via real-time texting apps.\n\nReal-time text protocols \nReal-time text protocols include Text over IP (ToIP) designed around ITU-T T.140, IETF RFC 4103, RFC 5194, and XMPP Extension Protocol XEP-0301.\n\nTotal conversation \nAccording to ITU-T Multimedia Recommendation F.703, total conversation defines the simultaneous use of audio, video and real-time text. An instant messaging program that can enable all three features simultaneously would be compliant. Real time text is an important part of it.\n\nHistory \nReal-time text is also historically found in the old UNIX talk, BBS software such as Celerity BBS, and older versions of ICQ messaging software.\n\nSee also \n Collaborative real-time editor\n Text over IP\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n realtimetext.org - Real Time Text Taskforce (R3TF)\n realjabber.org - Animation of what real-time text looks like / Information on XEP-0301\n Total Conversation by IV\u00e8S\n Total Conversation by Omintor\n Total Conversation in the cloud\n\nIMS services\nText", "machine_text": "Real-time text (RTT) refers to a mode of transmitting text messages instantaneously between two or more parties, where each party can receive and view text as it is typed by the other. Real-time text is a mode of communication that enables individuals who are deaf, hard of hearing, or have speech disabilities to communicate more effectively, using text instead of spoken language. Real-time text can be transmitted over various platforms and devices, including computers, mobile phones, and landline phones equipped with specialized software or hardware. The real-time text can appear on the screen of the receiving device in real-time, facilitating communication in an efficient and effective way. One of the main advantages of real-time text is that it is more accessible than traditional telephone communication for individuals with hearing or speech disabilities. In contrast to voice communication, where the words disappear into thin air, real-time text can be stored and reviewed, which can be particularly helpful for individuals who are unable to remember everything that has been said during the conversation. Real-time text is also useful in situations where voice communication is not practical or desirable. For example, in noisy environments, during public meetings, or when confidentiality is necessary, real-time text can be a more effective communication method than voice communication. Real-time text also has the potential to improve the quality of communication between individuals who speak different languages. Real-time text can be used to translate text on the fly, enabling users who speak different languages to communicate in real-time, without having to wait for translations. In conclusion, real-time text is a valuable communication mode that enables individuals with hearing or speech disabilities to communicate more effectively, and can be used as a more accessible and practical alternative to voice communication. With the advancement of technology, real-time text has the potential to revolutionize the way we communicate and connect with each other.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 32335474}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Polyhedral map projection\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "A polyhedral map projection is a map projection based on a spherical polyhedron. Typically, the polyhedron is overlaid on the globe, and each face of the polyhedron is transformed to a polygon or other shape in the plane. The best-known polyhedral map projection is Buckminster Fuller's Dymaxion map. When the spherical polyhedron faces are transformed to the faces of an ordinary polyhedron instead of laid flat in a plane, the result is a polyhedral globe.\n\nOften the polyhedron used is a Platonic solid or Archimedean solid. However, other polyhedra can be used: the AuthaGraph projection makes use of a polyhedron with 96 faces, and the myriahedral projection allows for an arbitrary large number of faces.\nAlthough interruptions between faces are common, and more common with an increasing number of faces, some maps avoid them: the Lee conformal projection only has interruptions at its border, and the AuthaGraph projection scales its faces so that the map fills a rectangle without internal interruptions. Some projections can be tesselated to fill the plane, the Lee conformal projection among them.\n\nTo a degree, the polyhedron and the projection used to transform each face of the polyhedron can be considered separately, and some projections can be applied to differently shaped faces. The gnomonic projection transforms the edges of spherical polyhedra to straight lines, preserving all polyhedra contained within a hemisphere, so it is a common choice. The Snyder equal-area projection can be applied to any polyhedron with regular faces. The projection used in later versions of the Dymaxion map can be generalized to other equilateral triangular faces, and even to certain quadrilaterals.\n\nPolyhedral map projections are useful for creating discrete global grids, as with the quadrilateralized spherical cube and Icosahedral Snyder Equal Area (ISEA) grids.\n\nHistory \nThe earliest known polyhedral projection is the octant projection developed by Leonardo da Vinci or his associate around 1514, which transforms the faces of an octahedron to Reuleaux triangles.\n\nChristian Gottlieb Reichard created a polyhedral globe based on the cube in 1803. An icosahedral globe appeared in 1851. Polyhedral globes cheaply constructed from cardboard were popular for a time in Europe.\n\nProjections based on dihedra begin appearing with the Peirce quincuncial projection in 1879, Guyou hemisphere-in-a-square projection in 1887, and Adams hemisphere-in-a-square projection in 1925. Although the dihedra are not traditional polyhedra they are spherical polyhedra, and the methods used in these projections are also used in other polyhedral projections. In the same work as the hemisphere-in-a-square projection, Adams created maps depicting the entire globe in a rhombus, hexagon, and hexagram.\n\nBernard J. S. Cahill invented the \"butterfly map\", based on the octahedron, in 1909. This was generalized into the Cahill\u2013Keyes projection in 1975 and the Waterman butterfly projection in 1996. Cahill's work was also influential on Fuller's Dymaxion maps: his first version, based on a cuboctahedron, was published in 1943, and his second, based on an icosahedron, was published in 1954.\n\nThe quadrilateralized spherical cube was devised in 1975 for the Cosmic Background Explorer project.\n\nGallery\n\nSee also \n HEALPix, which is not strictly a polyhedral map projection\n List of map projections\n\nReferences \n\nMap projections", "machine_text": "Polyhedral map projection is a type of projection technique that projects the surface of a sphere onto a polyhedron. This is done in order to obtain a flat map surface, which can be used for various mapping purposes including navigation, surveying and cartography. The polyhedral map projection technique is distinct from other projection techniques, such as cylindrical and conical projections, which also aim to flatten the surface of the Earth. The polyhedron used in polyhedral map projection is usually a regular polyhedron, such as a cube or an octahedron. The polyhedron is then unfolded into a flat surface, which is used to create a flat map of the Earth. The process of unfolding the polyhedron involves cutting and stretching the polyhedron's faces, which produces an approximation of the Earth's surface. This technique may produce some distortion of the map, but can be useful for a range of applications. Polyhedral map projections have been used for various purposes, ranging from creating maps of the ocean floor to mapping global ocean currents. One popular use of polyhedral map projections is in the construction of globe maps, which allow for easy visualization of the Earth's surface at a global scale. Globe maps are used by scientists and other professionals to study a range of phenomena, including climate change, natural disasters, and population demographics. In addition to globe maps, polyhedral map projections can also be used for creating flat maps of specific regions or countries. These maps can be used for various purposes, including urban planning, land-use mapping, and transportation planning. The advantages of using a polyhedral map projection over other projection techniques include their ability to represent the Earth's surface in a more accurate manner and their flexibility in adapting to different region-specific mapping needs. In conclusion, polyhedral map projection is a useful technique for creating flat maps of the Earth's surface. While some distortion may occur during the unfolding process, the technique is flexible and can be adapted to a wide range of mapping applications. The use of polyhedral map projection can help professionals and the general public better understand the Earth, its features, and its changing patterns.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 69388599}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Lucas aggregate supply function\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Lucas aggregate supply function or Lucas \"surprise\" supply function, based on the Lucas imperfect information model, is a representation of aggregate supply based on the work of new classical economist Robert Lucas.  The model states that economic output is a function of money or price \"surprise\".  The model accounts for the empirically based trade off between output and prices represented by the Phillips curve, but the function breaks from the Phillips curve since only unanticipated price level changes lead to changes in output.  The model accounts for empirically observed short-run correlations between output and prices, but maintains the neutrality of money (the absence of a price or money supply relationship with output and employment) in the long-run.  The policy ineffectiveness proposition extends the model by arguing that, since people with rational expectations cannot be systematically surprised by monetary policy, monetary policy cannot be used to systematically influence the economy.\n\nBackground \nNew classical economics made its first attempt to model aggregate supply in Lucas and Leonard Rapping (1969).  In this earlier model, supply (specifically labor supply) is a direct function of real wages: more work will be done when real wages are high and less when they are low. Under this model, unemployment is \"voluntary\". In 1972 Lucas made a second attempt at modelling aggregate supply.  This attempt drew from Milton Friedman's natural rate hypothesis that challenged the Phillips curve.  Lucas supported his original, theoretical paper that outlined the surprise based supply curve with an empirical paper that demonstrated that countries with a history of stable price levels exhibit larger effects in response to monetary policy than countries where prices have been volatile.\n\nOn the basis of Lucas' 1973 paper, Thomas Sargent and Neil Wallace introduced their 'surprise' supply function in which there was a white noise error term introduced that cannot be predicted in any way. Lucas introduced the effects of nominal and real shocks affecting a macro-economy into his system through price expectations: if expectations are true, output in any given period is at its natural level. However, the well-known and widely accepted aggregate production function described by Sargent and Wallace also provides leeway for the white-noise shocks independent of price expectations\u2013resulting in the accidental nature of equilibrium and in the inefficacy of countercyclical efforts of monetary policy.\n\nLucas's model dominated new classical economic business cycle theory until 1982 when real business cycle theory, starting with Finn E. Kydland and Edward C. Prescott, replaced Lucas's theory of a money driven business cycle with a strictly supply based model that used technology and other real shocks to explain fluctuations in output.\n\nTheory \nThe rationale behind Lucas's supply theory centers on how suppliers get information.  Lucas claimed that suppliers had to respond to a \"signal extraction\" problem when making decisions based on prices; the firms had to determine what portion of price changes in their respective industries reflected a general change in nominal prices (inflation) and what portion reflected a change in real prices for inputs and outputs. Lucas hypothesized that suppliers know their own industries better than the general economy.  Given this imbalance in information, a supplier could perceive a general increase in prices due to inflation as an increase the relative price for its output, reflecting a better, real price for its output and encouraging more production.  The surprise leads to an increase in production and employment throughout the economy.\n\nThe function can be represented simply as:\n\nThe simple version models aggregate output as a function of the price surprise.  A more complicated expression of the Lucas supply curve adds expectations to the model.  Aggregate supply is a function of the \u201cnatural\u201d level of output () and the difference between actual prices () and the expected price level given past information  times a coefficient based on an economy's sensitivity to price surprises ():\n\nBy invoking Okun's law to express the function in terms of unemployment, Lucas's supply function can be viewed as an expression of the expectations-augmented Phillips curve.\n\nSee also \n Lucas islands model\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading \n \n  \n \n\nNew classical macroeconomics", "machine_text": "Lucas Aggregate Supply Function is an economic model developed by Robert Lucas in 1972. It is a macroeconomic model that explains the relationship between the aggregate output and the price level in an economy. This model emphasizes the importance of the expectations and information of individuals in determining how the economy reacts to changes in the price level and aggregate demand. According to the Lucas Aggregate Supply Function, the relationship between the aggregate output and the price level is not always positive. In the short run, there may be a positive relationship between the two, but in the long run, the relationship may be negative. This model is based on the assumption that individuals have rational expectations, which means that they use all available information to make their economic decisions. This means that when the price level changes, individuals will adjust their expectations and behavior accordingly. One of the main contributions of the Lucas Aggregate Supply Function is its explanation of the relationship between inflation and unemployment. The model suggests that in the short run, there may be a trade-off between inflation and unemployment. This means that a decrease in unemployment may result in an increase in inflation. However, in the long run, there is no such trade-off as the economy moves towards its full employment equilibrium. The Lucas Aggregate Supply Function has been subject to criticism by some economists who argue that it relies heavily on the assumption of rational expectations. They argue that individuals may not always have the necessary information or may not be capable of processing it efficiently. Despite its criticisms, the Lucas Aggregate Supply Function continues to be an important model in macroeconomics. It has contributed significantly to our understanding of the relationship between inflation and unemployment and the importance of expectations and information in the economy.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 28155219}

Nine out of ten of the victims were not partisans.\n\nOf the total number of 5295 villages destroyed, 3% were destroyed in the first year of war in 1941, 16% in 1942, 63% in 1943 and 18% in 1944.\n\nFrequently state visitors come here to lay a wreath in memory of the more than two million dead.\n\nThe destruction of Khatyn and the murder of the villagers was an act of revenge in response to the bombardment of a German motorcade by Belarusian partisans on 22 March 1943, killing the company commander, Captain Hans Woellke, and three Ukrainian members of the Battalion 118 protection team. On the same day Khatyn was plundered and destroyed by Battalion 118 and SS Special Battalion Dirlewanger. They drove the inhabitants first into the village barn, set it on fire and with machine guns shot the people who tried to save themselves from the barn. A total of 149 villagers died, including 75 children. One adult, the then 56-year-old village blacksmith Iosif Kaminskij, and five children survived the destruction of Khatyn and the Second World War. Two more girls were able to flee from the burning barn into the forest and were taken in by inhabitants of the village Khvorosteni, but then died in the destruction of that very village.\n\nThe memorial \nThe memorial was inaugurated on 5 July 1969. It was designed and created by the architects Yuri Gradow, Leonid Lewin, Walentin Sankowitsch and the sculptor Sergej Selichanow. The opening began with a mourning ceremony in Minsk. Delegations from Russia, Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova and other republics of the Soviet Union, from the then twin cities and other foreign guests took part in the ceremony and the trip to Khatyn. This village represents the many destroyed villages in Belarus. The survivor Kaminskij also spoke at the opening ceremony.\n\nThe renovation and reconstruction of the State Memorial \"Khatyn\" was completed in July 2004, on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the \"Liberation of Belarus from the German-Fascist Conquerors\" in Khatyn, which was commemorated in the presence of the Presidents of Belarus, Aljaksandr Lukashenka, Russia, Vladimir Putin, and Ukraine, Leonid Kuchma. In July 2004, a photographic exposition was inaugurated at the memorial, commemorating Khatyn, Maly Trostenez and the Ozarichi concentration camp as another example.\n\nThe memorial contains many symbols, the three most important of which are probably the memories of Khatyn, the cemetery of the burnt villages and the trees of the rebuilt villages.\n\nFurthermore, the \"eternal flame\" burns in a large black granite stone block on which three birches grow.\n\nThis symbolizes the fact that about a quarter of all Belorussian inhabitants died in the Second World War.\n\nEverywhere in the area where the houses of Khatyn village once stood, their floor plans are indicated by concrete beams embedded in the ground. A symbolic chimney juts out into the air as a reminder of each fire ruin. A bell strikes every thirty seconds together with all the other bells in the chimney steles commemorating the destroyed houses. The number and ages of the victims are recorded at each house. At the entrance of the symbolic village there is a six-metre-high bronze sculpture depicting Iosif Kaminskij carrying his dead son Adam in his arms. Behind the sculpture there is also a symbolic reproduction of the village barn, which commemorates the annihilation of the village population.\n\nThe cemetery of the burned villages looks like the burial grounds on any modern cemetery. Uniform rows of graves and identical type of lettering. But each of the 185 graves represents a village that was destroyed in the so-called punitive operations. On each grave there is an urn filled with native soil and an inscription with the name of the village and the name of the district where the village used to be, which remained extinct after the war.\n\nThe names of 433 Belarusian villages, burned like Khatyn but rebuilt after the war, are immortalized like branches on symbolic \"trees of life\". In the Logojskij district alone, 21 villages and their populations were burned down. After the war 11 villages were rebuilt.\n\nIn a long memorial wall, memorial plates with the names and deaths of the concentration camps and extermination sites in Belarus were placed in niches. The path along this wall commemorates over 260 death camps and mass extermination sites of the German SS, the Ordnungspolizei and the Wehrmacht.\n\nReferences \n\nWar monuments and memorials\nMonuments and memorials in Belarus", "machine_text": "The National Memorial of the Republic of Belarus, also known as the Mound of Glory, is a historical and cultural monument located in the capital city of Minsk.

It acts as a potent inhibitor of the enzyme ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related (ATR) and with lower potency as an inhibitor of ATM serine/threonine kinase (ATM). These enzymes are both involved in detecting DNA damage as part of cell cycle checkpoints during cell division. By inhibiting their activity, berzosertib interferes with the ability of rapidly dividing cells to detect damage to DNA, and this makes it useful as a potential treatment for some forms of cancer by causing accumulation of DNA damage in the cancer cells and thus reducing their viability. It has progressed furthest in trials for the treatment of ovarian cancer, though also shows activity against numerous other cancer types.\n\nPhase 1 trial results show promising results in the first clinical trial of the drug class.The new study, designed to test the drug's safety, found that half of patients given the new drug either alone or with platinum chemotherapy saw their cancer stop growing, and two patients saw their tumors shrink or disappear completely.\n\nIn a UCLA-led study, berzosertib showed promise in treating COVID-19.\n\nReferences \n\nEnzyme inhibitors", "machine_text": "Berzosertib is a small-molecule inhibitor that works by inhibiting the protein ATR (ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related) kinase, which is responsible for regulating cellular responses to DNA damage.

Berzosertib was developed by the pharmaceutical company Mereo BioPharma and was originally known as MEDI3039. In 2018, it was granted orphan drug designation by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer. In clinical trials, Berzosertib has demonstrated activity against both solid tumors and hematological malignancies, including breast, lung, and ovarian cancers. This drug has also been observed to sensitize cancer cells to other chemotherapeutic agents, suggesting that it may be effective in combination therapy. One notable aspect of Berzosertib is its ability to selectively target cancer cells while leaving healthy cells relatively unscathed. This is due in part to the fact that cancer cells are more reliant on the ATR pathway than healthy cells, making them more susceptible to inhibition of ATR kinase activity. Currently, Berzosertib is undergoing further clinical development in combination with other cancer treatments such as PARP inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors. While it is still early days in terms of assessment of its full effectiveness, this promising drug has the potential to significantly improve the treatment of various cancers.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 64365868}

Nelson, 517 U.S. 25 (1996), is a Supreme court case that ruled that states could moderate national banks if doing so does not prevent or largely interfere with the national bank's ability to exercise its powers. Later, in 2004, the OCC (Office of the Comptroller of the Currency) authorized its preemption rule which declared that a national bank's ability to exert its incidental powers which include lending and deposit taking inhibited state laws that obstruct, impair or condition\u201d the business of banking.\"\n\nBackground\n\nUnder the National Bank Act, there is a dual banking system in the United States: a federal system based on national bank charters, and a state system formed on state charters. Under the act, a national bank association has the power to do what is necessary for its banking business.\n\nIn 1994, amongst a time of national bank expansion across state lines, Congress clearly declared its aim to create a path of freedom from state regulations by adopting the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (Riegle-Neal). This act sought a new preemption standard for national banks in America by administering that national banks were subject to state consumer laws as if they were sections of a state bank except when federal law preempted the application of a state law to a national bank or if the Office of the Comptroller of Currency (OCC) concluded that a state law inclined against national banks. Courts later held that the (Riegle-Neal) act gave the OCC the ability to apply state laws even if they were not prohibited.\n\nA Florida law prohibited Florida-licensed insurance agents from engaging in certain insurance activities such as deposits and engage in any activity incidental to receiving deposits where the agent was related with, among other things, any bank than one which was not a subordinate or associate of a bank capital company, and was located in a city with a populace of less than 5000 people.

Nelson was a landmark case that was decided by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1996. The case resulted in a significant ruling that changed the way banks in the United States operate their businesses. In 1990, Carolyn Nelson, a loan officer at Barnett Bank in Marion County, Florida, filed a claim with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), alleging that she had been dismissed from her job because of her age and gender. Nelson was 47 years old at the time of her dismissal. After the EEOC was unable to resolve the matter, she filed a lawsuit against the bank in federal court. Barnett Bank of Marion County argued that it had dismissed Nelson for performance-related reasons. However, Nelson provided evidence that suggested otherwise. She claimed that her male colleagues, who had similar or even worse performance records, were not dismissed, and that the bank's management had made sexist and ageist comments about her. The case reached the Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of Nelson. The ruling established the \"mixed-motive\" framework, which means that if an employee can show that an employer had both legitimate and discriminatory reasons for taking an adverse action against them, the burden of proof shifts to the employer to prove that it would have taken the same action regardless of the discriminatory motive. This ruling made it easier for employees to file claims of discrimination, and it also put the burden of proof on employers to prove that they do not discriminate against their employees. The ruling sent a clear message to banks and other employers that they cannot dismiss employees on discriminatory grounds, and that they will have to provide clear evidence to justify their actions. Overall, Barnett Bank of Marion County, N.A. v.

They are intended to be played at the same time, much like the previous Boris double album Dronevil, or as separate works.\n\nInitial teasers were posted at the start of the year, most prominently a live clip of \"Huge\" from the Fever performance on January 21. Rolling Stone announced YouTube streams of \"Heavy Rain\" and its accompanying section of \"Goloka pt. 1\" on February 5, 2016. Later in February, The Wire debuted a live video of Boris alone playing the song \"More\" from Leave Them All Behind 2015.\n\nBackground\n\nThe album was inspired by their June 2014 Boiler Room set, during which Boris played a drumless set, followed by Merzbow, and then a joint set by Boris with Merzbow. In support of Gensho, they played a one-off show at Fever in Tokyo on November 27, 2015; a recording of the concert called Gensho at Fever 11272015 is included as a bonus with the Japanese release of Gensho by Daymare Recordings. It includes the recorded debut of a new Boris song \"More\", as well as a performance of rare song \"Kilmister,\" created for the web anime series Ninja Slayer, and a cover of the Man song \"Many Are Called, but Few Get Up\". Because the Boris tracks are primarily drone-based, both presented versions of the song \"Akuma no Uta\" are actually more similar to \"Introduction\" from the same album; regardless, the song is credited as \"Akuma no Uta\" on all versions.\n\nThe vinyl version of the album is released as two separate double LPs; one LP with half of the Boris material and one LP with half of the Merzbow material. Thus, no matter which form is purchased, it is possible to play both contributors simultaneously. These are also available bundled together as a single deluxe edition.

It was released on March 18, 2016, by Sargent House records. The album contains two separate discs, one with Boris's music and the other with minimalist composer Merzbow's noise-oriented music. Both discs are intended to be played simultaneously, but there is no pre-determined starting point and order, thus creating a unique listening experience every time. The title of the album means \"phenomenon\" or \"manifestation\" in Japanese and reflects the experimental nature of the album. Gensho is comprised of six tracks on each disc, with the first track being the shortest and each successive track gradually increasing in duration. The tracks on Boris's disc contain familiar elements of the band's sound, such as heavy drone and sludge metal, accented by serene shoegaze textures. Merzbow's disc is distinctly harsher and abrasive, full of intense noise and distorted soundscapes. The album was initially conceived as part of a live performance for the Jazz Caf\u00e9 in London. Boris and Merzbow have collaborated on several projects over the years, and their approach on Gensho further exemplifies their shared desire to constantly push boundaries and experiment with sound. Critics praised the album for its innovative concept and execution. Gensho was noted for its ability to create a meditative and immersive listening experience, despite the seemingly disparate sounds presented. The album was included on several \"Best of 2016\" lists, such as Rolling Stone's \"20 Best Avant Albums of 2016\".

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"PA-class patrol ship (Germany)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The  (\"patrol boat abroad\") (PA)-class patrol ships were a class of vessels commissioned into the Kriegsmarine (German Navy) in the Second World War.\n\nThe ships were under construction in French shipyards that were seized by the Germans in 1940 at the Fall of France. Work on them continued under German control but progressed slowly, being subject to reluctance, or even sabotage, by the French workforce. Eventually only four were completed. The ships were commissioned in 1943\u201344 and deployed as escort vessels. Three were bombed and sunk by Royal Air Force (RAF) aircraft in 1944; the fourth was sunk as a block ship at Le Havre later the same year.\n\nBackground\nThe PA-class patrol vessels were originally laid down as part of a 1939 order by the French Navy for anti-submarine warfare vessels to a British design, called s in the Royal Navy. They were adapted from a merchant ship design and were suitable for building at merchant yards.\n\nOf the 18 ships ordered, 12 were under construction at British and six at French yards, four of which were at Chantier de St Nazaire-Penho\u00ebt. The order was overtaken by events, and none of the ships ordered was completed before the fall of France in June 1940. Saint-Nazaire, with four ships still under construction, fell into German hands, and as the town was in the occupied zone the Germans decided to complete the vessels for use by the German Kriegsmarine.\n\nDesign\nThe PA-class ships differed in several respects from the original Smiths Dock design, and therefore from the Flower-class corvettes in service with the Allies. This reflects their construction history and their intended use. The PAs retained the short forecastle which was a feature of the original design, but which the Royal Navy found impractical in heavy weather. Later Allied vessels were given a longer forecastle, and the early ships were altered as they refitted. This did not happen with the PAs, which retained the un-weatherly short forecastle throughout their service careers. The PAs had another original feature, the enclosed merchant-style bridge, though it was abandoned in Allied ships.\n\nThe focus of the PA class's role was as inshore and coastal escorts, where the chief danger was from mines or attack by aircraft and small craft, such as motor torpedo boats and gunboats. A number of changes to their armament and layout were made to reflect this. The PAs were equipped with minesweeping gear, and to accommodate these items the upswept stern gunwale, a characteristic of the original design, was cut away, producing a flat quarterdeck and simple wire rails. The PAs also had an enhanced anti-aircraft (AA) armament; two sets of twin 37\u00a0mm AA guns were fitted in a flying bridge amidships and a set of quadruple 20\u00a0mm guns was fitted aft. They also had a 20\u00a0mm quadruple mount in a tub set on the roof of the bridge; given the Flowers' reputation for rolling in any seas, putting such a weight so high up would have done no good for their seaworthiness.\n\nService history\nOn completion the four PAs had relatively short service careers. After a four-year building period, none of the ships was in service longer than nine months. The first to be completed, PA 2, joined  (\"15th Outpost Flotilla\") in September 1943, and took part in general patrol and escort duties, protecting coastal traffic against air and small craft attack in the English Channel. She was joined by PA 3 in November 1943 and PA 1 in April 1944.\n\nThe ships took part in a number of naval actions. In September 1943 PA 2 was part of a force escorting the freighter Maladi in the Channel when they were attacked by Allied motor torpedo boats and motor gun boats. One escort was damaged in the action and Maladi was sunk. In January 1944 PA 3 was part of a force that escorted the blockade-runner M\u00fcnsterland up the Channel, though M\u00fcnsterland was protected from ships it was sunk by the coastal artillery at Dover. In February PA 2 and PA 3 were with a force that successfully fought off an attack on the tanker Reckum, bringing her safely to Le Havre. The tanker was later sunk by the Dover batteries.\n\nIn June 1944, during the Allied invasion of Normandy, German naval units in the area came under persistent air attack. During RAF air raids at Le Havre PA 2 - along with six other escorts - was sunk on 15 June and PA 3 was irreparably damaged on 15\u201316 June. PA 1 survived until August, but was abandoned when the flotilla fled the town ahead of the Allied advance. PA 4 was unfinished when Nantes was liberated. She was launched as La T\u00e9lindi\u00e8re and sunk as a blockship in April 1945. She was raised and scrapped in 1946.\n\nShips in class\n\nNotes\n\nBibliography\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\n\nWorld War II patrol vessels of Germany\n1940s ships", "machine_text": "PA-class patrol ship (Germany) The PA-class patrol ship is a German naval vessel built by the L\u00fcrssen shipbuilding company. This class of ships is designed for a variety of missions, including maritime security, search and rescue operations, and enforcing laws in Germany's coastal waters. The German Navy operates five PA-class patrol ships, which were commissioned between 2005 and 2008. Design The PA-class of patrol ships comprises of five vessels, each with a length of 57.2 meters, a beam of 8.7 meters, and a draft of 2.5 meters. The ships are powered by two MTU 16V 1163 diesel engines, which provide a speed of 26 knots. The patrol ships have a range of 3,800 nautical miles at 12 knots, and can sail continuously for 14 days. The vessels are equipped with a variety of weapons and sensors, including an OTO Melara 76 mm gun, two 27 mm Mauser machine guns, and four 7.62 mm machine guns. In addition, the ships have a SeaKing Mk41 search radar, a STN Atlas EADS TRS-3D surface search radar, a Thales BlueWatcher EO/IR camera, and a Kongsberg Maritime 3000 series Echo Sounder. Mission capabilities The PA-class patrol ships have a range of capabilities, which make them ideal for maritime security and other missions. They can respond quickly to any maritime threats and carry out surveillance and reconnaissance operations. In addition, they can perform search and rescue operations, as well as provide support to other naval vessels. The ships are also used for law enforcement in Germany's coastal waters, particularly in the North Sea and Baltic Sea. They enforce laws related to fishing, smuggling, illegal immigration, and pollution control. The patrol ships have high endurance and can operate in adverse weather conditions, which make them suitable for working in the harsh environments of the North Sea and Baltic Sea. In conclusion, the PA-class patrol ship is a versatile and capable naval vessel designed for a range of missions. Its high speed, endurance, weapons and sensors, make this class of ships ideal for maritime security, search and rescue, and law enforcement operations. The five ships in service with the German Navy have proven to be reliable and effective, and are expected to remain in operation for many more years.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 32294576}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Lorraine 37L\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Lorraine 37L or , (\"tank supply tractor 1937 L\") is a light tracked armoured vehicle developed by the Lorraine company during the interwar period or interbellum, before the Second World War, to an April 1936 French Army requirement for a fully armoured munition and fuel supply carrier to be used by tank units for front line resupply. A prototype was built in 1937 and production started in 1939. In this period, two armoured personnel carriers and a tank destroyer project were also based on its chassis. Mainly equipping the larger mechanised units of the French Infantry arm, the type was extensively employed during the Battle of France in 1940. After the defeat of France, clandestine manufacture was continued in Vichy France, culminating in a small AFV production after the liberation and bringing the total production to about 630 in 1945. Germany used captured vehicles in their original role of carrier and later, finding the suspension system to be particularly reliable, rebuilt many into tank destroyers () of the Marder I type or into self-propelled artillery.\n\nDevelopment\nIn 1934, the order was given to design a munition supply vehicle to increase the operational range of independent tank units. The same year, the Renault 36R was selected for further development; three hundred were ordered from 1938. However, this tractor was only partially armoured; on 17 April 1936, a new set of specifications was drafted for a fully armoured vehicle to deliver fuel and munitions to tanks fighting on the frontline.\n\nEarly in 1937, the  company finished a prototype. It was a lengthened version of a proposed replacement type for the 1931 model Renault UE Chenillette tracked infantry supply tractor. In February 1937, the mat\u00e9riel commission, the , was ordered to test the prototype and to complete an evaluation before 1 November 1937, even if testing had not been finished. The prototype was only presented on 9 July and tested until 4 August. It was equipped with a 2371 cc Delahaye four cylinder 124 F engine. Although the vehicle attained a maximum speed of , this dropped to an unacceptably low  when an intended fuel trailer was attached. It was therefore returned to the factory and a more powerful Delahaye 135 engine and stronger clutch were fitted. This vehicle was tested between 22 September and 29 October and achieved the desired .\n\nProduction\nThe commission approved the type during late 1937, being especially impressed by the rugged suspension system. It was decided in September 1939 to reserve the total production capacity of the suspension elements for the larger tractor. This implied that the shorter Lorraine replacement for the Renault UE, though also favoured over other candidates, would not be taken into production: an order of hundred made early 1939 was that month shifted towards the longer version.\n\nIn 1938, three orders were made: of 78, 100 and another 100 vehicles of the  (TRC 37L); in 1939, before the war, a fourth order of 100 followed, and then a fifth of 74, to which was added the replacement order of 100 for a total of 552. The first vehicle was delivered by Lorraine on 11 January 1939; 212 had been delivered on 1 September 1939.\n\nThe ambitious plans made after the outbreak of war for the expansion of the number of armoured divisions meant that the Lorraine 37L orders had to be enlarged accordingly, bringing the total to 1012. The intended initial production rate was fifty per month, to be expanded to seventy. To assist in the manufacture, a second assembly hall was erected by Fouga at B\u00e9ziers, where it was hoped that it could produce at first twenty and later thirty vehicles per month. In reality, this number was never attained; e.g. 20 were made in January, 32 by both companies in May 1940. On 26 May 1940, 432 vehicles had been delivered to the army by Lorraine and Fouga out of 440 produced. Production continued after that date and an estimated total of about 480 to 490 had been reached by 25 June 1940, the end of the Battle of France.\n\nDescription\nBeing derived from a  project, the Lorraine 37 L was a rather small vehicle, just 1.57 metres wide. Space had been found by lengthening the chassis to 4.22 metres, making it rather oblong. Lacking a turret or superstructure its height was also not excessive at just 1.215 metres. The small dimensions combined with a light armour \u2014 nine millimetres for the vertical riveted plates, six for the top and bottom and twelve for the cast rounded nose section \u2014 ensured a low weight: the basic TRC 37L weighs just 5.24 metric tonnes empty, the trailer adding 1.2 tonnes.\n\nGiven the vehicle's low weight, the suspension was quite robust and exceptionally reliable in comparison with other systems used on French armour of the time, that were either too complicated or too flimsy. Six large road wheels in three pairs of bogies gave a low ground pressure and good weight distribution. Each bogie was allowed a vertical movement in its entirety, sprung by an inverted leaf spring assembly located just below the upper track run, the three assemblies being placed between the four top rollers. The tracks were  wide. The drive sprockets were in the front and driven by a transmission in the nose of the vehicle. The two crew members, the driver on the left, sat in the forward compartment, the drive shaft between them. Entrance to the compartment was by two wide horizontal hatches, the upper hinging upwards, allowing the driver an unobstructed view if opened, the lower hinging downwards.\n\nThe centrally positioned engine compartment was separated by a bulkhead from the driver compartment in front of it. The external silencer was on the left of the vehicle under an armoured covering. All vehicles in the series were powered by a Delahaye Type 135 six-cylinder 3.556 litre engine developing  at 2800 rpm, giving a maximum speed of 35\u00a0km/h and an average speed of 20\u00a0km/h. The wading capacity was 60 centimetres, a trench of 130 centimetres could be crossed and an incline of 50% climbed. There was a fuel supply of 114 litres, allowing for a range of 137 kilometres. There were five forward drives and one rear drive.\n\nAt the back was an armoured ammunition bin; a load of 810 kilograms can be carried, bringing the weight to 6.05 tonnes. As with the Renault UE, the TRC 37L was supplied with a tracked, armoured trailer with two road wheels per side, mostly used to carry a 565-litre fuel tank to supply the tank units; total load capacity is 690\u00a0kg for a total for the combination of 1.5 tonnes and a total weight of the trailer of 1890\u00a0kg. At 155\u00a0cm, the trailer was somewhat narrower than the main vehicle, and higher at 133\u00a0cm. It increased the length of the combination to 6.9 metres. The trailer also carried a Vulcano fuel pump and stowage boxes for lubrication oil, greases, water and assorted equipment to serve the tank maintenance teams.\n\nThe Lorraine 37Ls were painted in the standard army green, a rather greyish colour, over which a brown pattern of dark earth was sprayed.\n\nTactical function and operational history\nIn 1939, the Lorraine 37 L was gradually introduced to the supply units of the tank battalions. This coincided with a change in tactical thinking about the use of armour. In the early thirties, French doctrine had favoured the construction of ever deeper defensive belts to counter infantry infiltration tactics to defeat enemy attacks before they could develop into full-scale manoeuvre warfare, a field at which the French were aware being less adept than their most likely adversary, Germany. Expecting any possible enemy to defend himself likewise, the armour branch of the French Infantry became much preoccupied with the vexing problem of how to break through similar in-depth positions itself, emphasizing close cooperation with the foot soldier. Far less attention was paid to the next phase: the envelopment of the enemy forces.\n\nThe situation changed in the late thirties. Having at last built a considerable number of modern and well-armoured tanks, the Infantry became confident in its ability to break the enemy line, if sufficient artillery and air support was provided within a combined arms tactic. At the same time the political situation made it likely that large-scale offensives were needed to bring Germany to its knees. Though few officers advocated the creation of armoured divisions able to execute both the breakthrough and the strategic exploitation phase \u2014 these required trained personnel in numbers that simply would not be available \u2014 it was understood that the \"manoeuvre mass\" of tanks effecting the break would immediately have to envelop the defensive enemy position and defeat counterattacking enemy armour reserves, otherwise the momentum of the attack would be lost and the breach would not be kept open long enough for the motorised divisions and cavalry armoured divisions to be launched to quickly occupy and hold strategic key positions.\n\nHowever, this posed a serious logistical problem: trucks would not be able to closely follow the tanks on the battlefield. The prescribed procedure for resupplying was for the tanks to return to their start positions to be refitted. While this had still been practical in the previous war with its much slower tempo of operations, it was unacceptable in modern warfare. The tanks would have to be supplied in the field to continue their advance as soon as possible. Thus a tracked supply vehicle was needed that could overcome the expected poor terrain conditions, with many shell-craters and trenches, and it had to be armoured to protect against shell-fragments, given that the breakthrough sector would likely be in range of concentrated enemy artillery.\n\nThe type was provided to the armoured units of both the Infantry and the Cavalry. Each independent tank battalion of the Infantry, or , had an organic strength of twelve Lorraine tractors: four in the  (supply platoon) of each of its three companies. The BCCs incorporated in the armoured divisions and equipped with the Char B1 or Char B1 bis had 27 TRC 37Ls: each of their three companies had six tractors in its supply platoon and furthermore a single tractor organic to each of its three tank platoons. This extra allotment was made to compensate for the large fuel consumption of these heavy tanks, that, apart from being simply bigger, had also a rather limited range. Each group of three tanks was in their case thus directly followed by its own fuel supply.\n\nWhen, during the Battle of France, independent companies were formed, these, too, had their Lorraine tractors \u2014 an increased allotment of eight if a Char B1 bis unit, otherwise the standard allotment of four. However, the older FT 17 battalions only used fuel trucks. Likewise, the TRC 37L was not in common use in the colonies; however, when the 67e BCC, which was equipped with the Char D1, was brought over from Tunisia in June, it was provided with tractors. The motorised infantry divisions did not use the TRC 37L.\n\nIn the Cavalry, each squadron of twenty tanks had three Lorraine tractors, for a total of 24 for each mechanised light division. The AMR 35 or Panhard 178 units did not use the type, just trucks as its speed was considered insufficient. It was proposed to remedy this by fitting a stronger engine, bringing the speed to 50\u00a0km/h. The TRC 37L was also not present in the cavalry light divisions.\n\nIn practice, the supply vehicles would mainly move by road and meet with the tanks at predetermined rendez-vous points. Refuelling was relatively quick as the Vulcano could theoretically pump 565 litres in fifteen minutes. To completely refill a heavy tank would normally take about forty to sixty minutes. The trailer fuel reservoirs could themselves be replenished by the company fuel truck carrying 3600 litres of petrol. The company supplies could again be restocked from battalion stocks, moved by trucks loaded with fifty litre fuel drums. This method of distribution ensured a sufficient fuel supply on the tactical level, but was too cumbersome for strategic movements: if large distances had to be covered on track, the tanks would be directly refuelled from fuel trucks.\n\nWhen the Germans invaded on 10 May, French tank units had an organic strength of 606 Lorraine 37Ls; the numbers produced were thus insufficient to provide each unit with its official complement. About a third had to do without. That day French general headquarters decided to increase the TRC 37L strength of  and  by a half; these armoured divisions had been earmarked as reserves against an expected German breakthrough attempt in the Gembloux Gap and the low range of the Char B1 bis worried French command. To free enough tractors, , still in the process of being constituted, had to give up its twelve TRC L37s to . However, contrary to French expectations, the main German breakthrough would be at Sedan and  was sent to block it \u2014 and despite its larger number of fuel tractors,  was still surprised by  while refuelling on 15 May.\n\nDuring the campaign, the TRC 37L crews quickly saw the need for some armament and began to improvise machine-gun mounts on their vehicles.\n\nVariants\n\nThe first development from the TRC 37L was an armoured personnel carrier, the  (\"Armoured mounted infantry vehicle 38L\"). Like the TRC 37L, this Lorraine 38L was equipped with an armoured tracked trailer. The total capacity was twelve men: the driver and one passenger in the driving compartment, four in the former cargo bay, and six in the trailer. To protect the infantry squad, high box-like armoured superstructures were built over both the bin and the trailer, with doors at their back. The loaded weight of the main vehicle was 7.7 tonnes. A total of 240 VBCP 38L vehicles were ordered, of which nine had been delivered on 1 September 1939 and around 150 by 25 June 1940. In view of the war threat, the order was made before the prototype could be tested. Of all participants in the Battle of France, the French army would thus be the only to employ a fully tracked APC. The vehicles were intended for the , the (single) mechanised infantry battalion within the , or armoured division of the Infantry. However, on 10 May, they had not yet been allocated to these units, who still used half-tracks. During May, the vehicles were hurriedly taken into use by the 5e BCP and 17e BCP of the 1re DCr and 2nd DCr respectively. The 4e DCr did not receive any.\n\nAn improved model, the VBCP 39L, was created by expanding the cargo bay to carry eight passengers, apart from the two crew members. This model had no trailer and a total capacity of ten persons; extra room was found by raising the upper deck \u2014 the passenger compartment was open-topped \u2014 and constructing a more forward sloped armour glacis, contiguous with the nose section; the type thus resembled postwar APCs. Some two hundred VBCP 39L vehicles were ordered, to replace the 38L on the production lines from the 241st vehicle onwards, but none had been delivered by June 1940, the manufacture remaining limited to a single prototype. Experimental and limited production models included tank destroyers armed with 47\u00a0mm SA 47 guns () and command post vehicles; probably a  prototype was produced.\n\nVichy production\n\nIn 1939 and 1940 the type had been mainly produced in the Lorraine factory at Lun\u00e9ville. Early 1939 it was decided to erect a factory in a more southern location, less vulnerable to German bombing, at Bagn\u00e8res-de-Bigorre. This  had not made a single vehicle by the time of the armistice between France and Germany, but it was, like the other tractor-producing Fouga factory at B\u00e9ziers, located in the unoccupied zone of Vichy France. Limited production continued after June 1940 for a total of about 150, although military models were not officially produced. Some of these vehicles had a shortened chassis, their suspension consisting of only two bogies per side. Lorraine tractors were ostensively fitted for use in forestry and construction; in reality they constituted a clandestine armoured fighting vehicle production as they could be easily rebuilt. The AMX factory secretly produced armoured bodies for these vehicles, which were stockpiled. The type was called the . After the German occupation of the south of France in November 1942, many of these chassis were hidden. In the spring of 1944, the French resistance attacked the Bagn\u00e8res factory on orders from London, the allies assuming that it produced vehicles for Germany. To prevent further attacks, the resistance was informed of and involved in the affair in the summer of 1944 by the promise to arm existing vehicles for their use. The first twenty of these were delivered in January 1945, after the liberation, and the factory continued modifying vehicles for the duration of the war at a rate of about twenty a month, often by fitting an armoured superstructure, armed with a light or heavy machine-gun, to the front or back of the chassis.\n\nGerman use\nA considerable number of Lorraine tractors, about 360, fell into German hands. Due to its reliability, the type was well suited to the mobile tactics the Germans favoured in 1941 and 1942. They were first used as such, renamed the . As the Germans themselves had not produced a similar type, the Lorraine tractors filled a requirement for fully tracked supply vehicles as  or . In July and August 1942, Major Alfred Becker directed the conversion of 170 of these vehicles into the  or Marder I, a 75\u00a0mm equipped self-propelled anti-tank gun. At the same time, 106 were converted into self-propelled artillery: 94 into the  and twelve into the . Also, an artillery observation vehicle was provided: the , thirty of which were produced. A single conversion entailed the fitting of a Soviet 122\u00a0mm howitzer: the .  The Germans also employed the VBCP 38L as the Lorraine 38L(f).\n\nFor a time, it has also been assumed that a 47\u00a0mm tank destroyer conversion existed: the presumed \"4.7cm Pak181(f) auf PanzerJ\u00e4ger Lorraine Schlepper (f)\", based on preserved photographs that, however, in reality depicted the French  mentioned above, an ad hoc conversion built in June 1940.\n\nGerman designations\n  - The Lorraine tractor as captured.\n  - Supply vehicle\n  - Ammunition carrier\n  - 170 Marder I, a 7.5cm PaK40/1 equipped self-propelled anti-tank gun.\n  - 94 self-propelled artillery vehicles, mounting 15cm sFH13/1 howitzers.\n  - twelve self-propelled artillery vehicles, mounting 10.5cm leFH18/40 L/28 howitzers.\n  - An artillery observation vehicle, thirty of which were produced.\n  - A single conversion mounting a Soviet 122\u00a0mm howitzer on the Lorraine chassis.\n\nGallery\n\nAfter the war\nLorraine tractors were used after World War II for various experimental roles. A number were sold on the civilian market, being used to carry cranes and digging equipment. However, the factory did not secure, despite lobbying, an order from the French Army, due to the fact that so much discarded Allied mat\u00e9riel could be obtained for free. Likewise, an attempt in 1946 to export the type to Switzerland failed. Some were listed in the army inventories for a few years after the war; the last known user was Syria. The Maurice Dufresne Museum, in Azay-le-Rideau, and the State Military Technical Museum, at Ivanovskoje, exhibit surviving vehicles of the shortened version. Two vehicles of the long version are part of the collection of the  at Dresden.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n  Vauvillier, Fran\u00e7ois & Jean-Michel Touraine,  Paris: Editions Ch.

He again reported sick in July, and did not return to the 48th Battalion until mid-August.\n\nOn 18 September 1918, the 48th Battalion was involved in the attack on the Hindenburg Outpost Line during the Hundred Days Offensive. After the first phase of the attack, some elements of Woods' unit were tasked to support another battalion as it conducted a further assault. When it was suspected that flanking British troops had not gone forward to their objective as reported, a four-man patrol including Woods attempted to make contact with them. Instead of finding British troops, they encountered a strong German post and, after calling for reinforcements, attacked it, driving more than thirty Germans from the position. Woods' actions during this assault and subsequent defence of the captured post resulted in him being awarded the Victoria Cross. Woods survived the war, returned to Australia and operated a vineyard and orchard in Western Australia. He retired early due to ill health and died in 1963. His medals are displayed in the Hall of Valour at the Australian War Memorial.\n\nEarly life\nJames Park \"Jimmy\" Woods was born at Two Wells, South Australia, on 4 January 1886, the son of a blacksmith, James Woods, and his wife Ester  Johnson. After his mother's death when he was seven, Woods was raised by a stepsister and, after completing his schooling, worked in a vineyard alongside his brothers. Not long after World War I broke out in 1914, he attempted to enlist in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF), but was rejected due to his height of . He and his brother Will then moved to Western Australia and for the next two years worked in cartage and fencing in the Kantanning district before James became a viticulturist at Caversham in the Swan Valley wine region near Perth. He was also an enthusiastic cricketer in his younger years. After further unsuccessful attempts to join the AIF, he was eventually successful on 29 September 1916, after height requirements had been lowered.\n\nWorld War I\n\n1916\u20131917\nFollowing his enlistment as a private, Woods was allotted as a reinforcement to the 48th Battalion, a mixed South Australian-Western Australian unit, part of the 12th Brigade, 4th Division. It was already serving on the Western Front in France and Belgium. After two months training at Blackboy Hill, Woods embarked with the rest of his reinforcement draft on  at Fremantle on 23 December 1916. He disembarked at Devonport in the UK on 16 February 1917, and joined the 12th Training Battalion at Codford on Salisbury Plain. During this training period, he was hospitalised with mumps and then with bronchitis and pneumonia. Recovered, he completed his training, embarked at Southampton for France, and joined the 48th Battalion on 12 September.\n\nAt the time Woods joined the battalion, it was undergoing training and absorbing reinforcements in a rest area at Zuytpeene. On 21 September, the battalion was collected by buses and transported over several days via Steenvoorde to the vicinity of Ypres in Belgium. There the 12th Brigade relieved other units of the 4th Division that had participated in the Battle of Polygon Wood and took up support positions. During this period its main tasks were battlefield salvage and digging graves for recently killed Germans and Australians. Despite these non-combat tasks, the battalion suffered several casualties from German artillery fire. The 48th Battalion was relieved from these positions on 1 October, and occupied trenches at Westhoek Ridge overnight before returning to Steenvoorde.\n\nAfter a week at Steenvoorde, Woods' battalion marched to Abeele on 10 October, then entrained for Ypres. That evening it marched to trenches on Westhoek Ridge, where it received orders for a major attack by the division: the First Battle of Passchendaele, which was fought on 12 October. Despite initial success and the capture of more than 200 Germans, the main attack failed, leaving the left flank of the battalion exposed. The first German counterattack was beaten off, but with its left flank unprotected, the 48th Battalion was pushed back to its start line by a second counterattack. During the fighting, the unit suffered 370 casualties from its original complement of 621. Woods and the rest of the battalion were withdrawn from the line and they were re-united with the nucleus troops, the one-third of each unit that was retained out of the line when a battalion went into action. Thus reinforced, the battalion then went briefly into a support position on Anzac Ridge on 19 October, before being relieved and marching away from Passchendaele for a long period of rest and recuperation. This time was spent first at Cuhem, then Friancourt before the battalion spent a few weeks at a camp near P\u00e9ronne, where Woods and the rest of the unit celebrated Christmas Day.\n\n1918\nOn 8 January 1918, the 48th Battalion marched to P\u00e9ronne and, travelling by train and on foot, arrived in Belgium where they entered the front line trenches near Hollebeke on 11 January. The battalion remained in the quiet trenches in cold winter conditions for ten days before being relieved, being mainly engaged on improving the dilapidated defences. On the day after the battalion was relieved and went into the rear area, Woods reported sick. He was diagnosed with either bronchitis or pericarditis, and was evacuated to a hospital in Birmingham, UK. He did not return to his battalion until 30 May, when the battalion was in a rest area at Rivery. On 2 June the unit moved forward again, taking up positions as part of the divisional reserve. Two weeks later, the 48th Battalion moved into the front line near Sailly-le-Sec, from which it was relieved on 4 July. It then went back into a rest area near Allonville with the remainder of the 4th Division. This rest period continued to the end of the month, but on 23 July, Woods reported sick with dysentery. He was evacuated and admitted to a casualty clearing station to recover, and did not return to his unit until 16 August. At this time, the battalion was in the front line near Lihons, where it had a quiet time until relieved on 24 August. The unit was then withdrawn to a rest area near Saint-Vaast-en-Chauss\u00e9e where it remained for nearly two weeks.\n\nBy September 1918, the Allies were in the midst of the Hundred Days Offensive, a series of unanswered attacks that had commenced with the Battle of Amiens on 8 August. As part of the attack on the Hindenburg Outpost Line on 18 September, the 48th Battalion led the assault in the first phase, capturing 480 Germans, and they were followed by the 45th and 46th Battalions which were responsible for the second and third phases respectively. The Australian attack was near Le Verguier, north-west of St. Quentin. On the right flank of the 12th Brigade, the British 1st Division delayed its assault on the third objective line. The commander of the 12th Brigade, Brigadier General Raymond Leane, therefore ordered two companies of the 48th Battalion to protect the flank of the 46th Battalion as it conducted the third phase of the attack. After the 46th Battalion's successful assault, the two companies of the 48th Battalion were tasked to assist the 46th Battalion in consolidating their position. The British 1st Division on the right flank repeatedly reported that they had also captured the third objective, and Leane sent patrols to confirm.\n\nWoods was a member of a four-man patrol sent on Leane's orders to make contact with the British. Instead of finding British troops, they located a strongly defended German position with excellent fields of fire. While an attack in force on the position was being organised, Woods led the patrol against the German defenders. Woods killed one German, and at least thirty others fled, leaving behind four heavy and two light machine guns. One of the patrol was wounded in the assault, but they managed to hold off several determined counterattacks until reinforcements arrived. Woods climbed onto the parapet, lay down, and threw hand grenades passed to him, causing severe casualties to the Germans. Reinforcements arrived when he was down to his last few rifle cartridges, and the post was secured by dawn. During the overall brigade attack, the 48th Battalion suffered just 65 casualties. For his work, Woods was recommended for the Victoria Cross (VC).\n\nThe 4th Division was then relieved and went to the rear to rest, and the brigade did not return to combat before the Armistice of 11 November 1918. Woods' VC citation was published on Christmas Eve 1918, and read:\n\nWoods' VC was the only one awarded to a member of the 48th Battalion. He received the decoration from King George V at Buckingham Palace on 31 May 1919. Woods embarked aboard the troop ship  on 21 June, arrived back in Fremantle in early August, and was discharged from the AIF the following month.\n\nLater life\n\nOn his return to civilian life, Woods bought and operated a vineyard and orchard in the Swan Valley. He married Olive Adeline Wilson at the Caversham Methodist Church on 30 April 1921. The couple had seven children: four sons and three daughters. James suffered from poor health as a result of his gassing and chest infections during his service, and in 1937 retired on a full pension, expected to only live a few more years. The family moved to Claremont. His sons Gordon and Norman served in the Royal Australian Air Force during World War II; Gordon, the eldest, was killed in a flying training accident near Newcastle, New South Wales, in October 1943. In retirement, Woods was involved with the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, serving as president of the Caversham sub-branch, and was a keen fisherman. In 1956, he went to the UK to attend the VC centenary.\n\nWoods died on 18 January 1963 in the Repatriation General Hospital, Hollywood, in Nedlands, aged 77, and was buried in Karrakatta Cemetery. He was survived by his wife and six children. A ward at the Repatriation General Hospital, now known as the Hollywood Private Hospital, is named in his honour.\n\nAs well as the Victoria Cross, British War Medal and Victory Medal for his service in World War I, Woods was later awarded the King George VI Coronation Medal and Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal. His medal set, including his Victoria Cross, was presented to the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, and is displayed in the Hall of Valour. The Victoria Cross was the highest award possible at the time, and is considered the equivalent of the Victoria Cross for Australia, which was created in 1991.\n\nNotes\n\nFootnotes\n\nReferences\n\nBooks\n\nNews and gazettes\n\nWebsites\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1886 births\n1963 deaths\nAustralian World War I recipients of the Victoria Cross\nAustralian Army soldiers\nPeople from Two Wells, South Australia\nBurials at Karrakatta Cemetery", "machine_text": "James Park Woods James Park Woods (born 1990) is an American entrepreneur and co-founder of the fitness tracking company, Fitbit.

Although nominally led by party President Sidi el-Mokhtar N'Diaye, it was de facto headed by Moktar Ould Daddah.\n\nFoundation\nDaddah founded the party in May 1958 in an attempt to unite the various competing political groups within  Mauritania into a single inclusive organisation so as to both strengthen the credibility of Mauritanian independence movement and secure his own power. At the Council of Aleg Daddah persuaded the Mauritanian Progressive Union, the Entente Mauritanienne, and the black nationalist Bloc D\u00e9mocratique du Gorgol to merge to form the Mauritanian Regroupment Party.\n\nIdeology\nThe party was strongly nationalistic, and opposed the inclusion of Mauritania into either a Greater Morocco, or any other form of federation, rejecting a proposal by France for a federation uniting all of its Saharan African territories into a Common Saharan States Organization. The party did however favour joining the French Community, and campaigned for a yes vote in the 1958 referendum.\n\nThe party sought to maintain the balance between Mauritania's Moorish and Black African communities, and local PRM committees were set up that were open to all citizens. In July 1958 more radical anti-French and Arab nationalist members were expelled, and later formed the Nadha party on September 26, 1958. The PRM moved closer to Mali for support against Morocco's plans for the inclusion of Mauritania in a Greater Morocco, plans which the Arab nationalist Nadha party supported. The PRM also developed a more flexible attitude towards France.\n\nIndependence & Dissolution\nThe PRM went on to win every seat at the 1959 parliamentary election, although did so largely due to non-PRM political activity being banned, and PRM loyalists controlling selections to the electoral lists. Following independence in November 1960 most Mauritanian politicians rallied around Daddah and the PRM, and relations between the PRM and the Nadha party warmed, with the latter being granted several seats in the Council of Ministers in September 1961.\n\nIn October 1961 Daddah organised a Conference of Unity, and on 4 October the PRM was merged with several other Mauritanian parties to form the Mauritanian People's Party.\n\nElectoral history\n\nPresidential elections\n\nNational Assembly elections\n\nReferences \n\nDefunct political parties in Mauritania\nParties of one-party systems\nMauritanian nationalism", "machine_text": "The Mauritanian Regroupment Party (Parti du Rassemblement Mauritanien, PRM) is a political party in Mauritania founded in 1991 by former Prime Minister Ahmed Ould Daddah. The PRM is a center-left political party that advocates for a democratic and pluralistic society in Mauritania. Its principles are based on social justice, equality, and national solidarity. The party has been vocal in the fight against corruption and discrimination, and has called for greater accountability in government. In the 1992 presidential elections, the PRM supported Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya, who won the election and appointed Ould Daddah as his prime minister. However, tensions emerged between Ould Daddah and Taya, and in 2003, Ould Daddah resigned from the government. In the 2007 presidential elections, the PRM fielded its own candidate, Ibrahima Moctar Sarr, who finished in sixth place with only 1.8% of the vote. The party did not contest the 2009 presidential elections, but participated in the 2013 and 2014 legislative elections. In the latter election, the PRM won two seats in the National Assembly. The PRM has also been active in promoting regional integration and cooperation, particularly with neighboring West African countries. The party has called for greater economic integration with the region and for Mauritania to play a leading role in the advancement of the African continent. The current leader of the PRM is former diplomat Mohamed Ould Maouloud, who was elected as the party's secretary-general in 2013. Under his leadership, the PRM has continued to advocate for greater democratization, human rights, and social justice in Mauritania.

The name \"Phacium\" means \"lens-like,\" which is a reference to the fungus's shape. Phacium fungi are typically small, with a height range of less than 1mm to 4mm and can be found growing in a variety of habitats including soil and leaf litter. The fruiting body of Phacium appears in the form of black, brown, or reddish-brown discs that are attached to the substrate by a small stalk. These fruiting bodies are also called apothecia and contain the sexual spores or ascospores. Phacium fungi are saprobic, meaning they obtain their nutrients from dead plant and animal material. They are important in the decomposition of plant matter, which recycles carbon and nutrients back into the ecosystem. Phacium has been recorded to cause brown rot of potatoes, but its pathogenicity to humans and other animals remains unknown. There are over 70 species of Phacium, and the genus is widely studied in fungal taxonomy and biodiversity research. Molecular techniques are now being employed to identify and classify Phacium fungi accurately. While there is no known commercial or medicinal use for Phacium fungi, they play a crucial role in maintaining soil fertility and the global carbon cycle. Furthermore, understanding the diversity of Phacium species has implications for agricultural practices and ecosystem management.

In 2009 the Suquamish tribe launched a capital campaign to construct a new facility, enlisting Senator Patty Murray and former Washington Secretary of State Ralph Munro to help lead the effort. The new facility opened in 2012 and is triple the size of the original building. Constructed at a cost of $6 million, the  purpose-built structure is set in a small botanical garden on the Port Madison Indian Reservation and consists of two galleries, a gift shop, a 50-seat auditorium, and a climate-controlled storage room used to house artifacts not on display. The facility was designed by the Seattle architectural firm Mithun and is a LEED Gold certified building.

Originally in the custody of the Burke Museum at the University of Washington, the artifacts, which include harpoon points, smoking pipes, and jewelry, were transferred to the Suquamish tribe in 2013.  In 2014, the Port of Seattle transferred additional artifacts to the museum, including crockery and glass bottles, discovered during archaeological excavations in the 1970s at the Baba'kwob site, a pre-contact village located in what is now Seattle's Belltown neighborhood. The controversial transfer was contested by the Duwamish, an unrecognized tribe and historic Suquamish rival who claim ownership of the artifacts.\n\nExhibitions\nThe museum's main gallery features a permanent exhibit titled \"Ancient Shores \u2013 Changing Tides\" that showcases drawings, documents, and historic photographs related to the Suquamish Tribe, contemporary and historic crafts, and interpretative panels and multimedia elements. The centerpiece of this exhibit is a 300-year-old carved canoe that was last used in the 1989 Paddle to Seattle, the first of a now annual series of canoe journeys through the Salish Sea undertaken by tribal members.\nA second gallery is used to house rotating exhibits from the museum's permanent collection, or items on loan from other museums, including traveling exhibits from the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service (SITES).

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"George Woolf\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "George Monroe Woolf (May 31, 1910 \u2013 January 4, 1946), nicknamed \"The Iceman\", was a Canadian thoroughbred race horse jockey.  An annual jockey's award given by the United States Jockeys' Guild is named in his honor. He became known for riding the people's champion Seabiscuit to victories in 1938.\n\nAfter his early death resulting from a racing accident, Woolf was inducted into newly founded honorary institutions: the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame, Canada's Sports Hall of Fame and the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame.\n\nEarly life and education\nWoolf was born on a ranch in Cardston, Alberta to horse people - his mother had been a trick rider in a circus and his father rode in rodeos. Woolf learned to ride horses as a child and as a teenager he rode in horse races and competed in  rodeo events in Alberta and Montana.\n\nGeorge's mother, Rosina Parker, was born in Wales, and his maternal grandmother was from England. His father, Frank Henry Woolf, was a Utah pioneer born before 1869 and an Alberta pioneer coming to Canada before 1890.  His paternal grandfather Absalom Woolf and great-grandfather J.A. Woolf were Mormon pioneers, both settlers of Cache Valley, Utah.  Absalom Woolf was a soldier in the Utah militia serving in the Walkara Indian War and also the Utah War.\n\nWoolf's ancestor, Peter Woolf, was an early settler of New York, immigrating from Germany.\n\nOn the Newell and Olmstead side of his family, Woolf was related to the fur trapper and mountain man Robert \"Doc\" Newell, and related as well to Charles O. Card, the founder of the town of Cardston, Alberta.\n\nWoolf's rodeo and horse training associates included the Bascom brothers - Raymond, Melvin, Earl and Weldon Bascom.\n\nCareer\n\nHe began racing thoroughbreds professionally in 1928 in Vancouver, British Columbia.  He also raced in Tijuana, Mexico before going to Arcadia, California, where he made his permanent home.\n\nUsing Santa Anita Park as his home base, Woolf became one of the premier jockeys of his era; he was known by fellow jockeys and fans as \"The Iceman\". He earned the nickname for displaying the patience in waiting for the right time to have his horse make a move in a race, as well as his calm attitude before major races, when he could take a nap while other jockeys nervously paced about.\n\nWhile establishing himself as one of America's leading jockeys, he was diagnosed with what is now known as type 1 diabetes. Only a few years earlier, before the discovery of insulin, such a diagnosis would have been fatal. Because of his condition, and the nature of diabetes management in the 1930s and 1940s, Woolf had to regulate his weight to avoid rapid dieting. His racing success allowed him to accept only a few mounts each week, riding only 150\u2013200 races each year compared to as many as a thousand rides other jockeys might undertake, and for years he maintained top physical condition.  Despite his limited number of races and a relatively short career, Woolf won ninety-seven major stakes races around the United States, including the Hollywood Gold Cup Stakes, the American Derby and the Belmont Futurity Stakes three years running.\n\nHe made history in 1935 when he rode Azucar to victory in the first $100,000 horse race, the Santa Anita Handicap, defeating such greats as Equipoise and Twenty Grand. Woolf finished second twice at the Kentucky Derby and won the 1936 Preakness Stakes. \n\nHe is remembered for his tactical performance in the 1938 match race when he rode Seabiscuit to victory over the heavily favored U.S. Triple Crown champion, War Admiral, in the Pimlico Special at Baltimore, based on advice from his friend, Seabiscuit's injured regular jockey Red Pollard.  When asked which was the best racehorse he had ever ridden, Woolf answered immediately, \"Seabiscuit\".\n\nDeath\nDuring the running of the fourth race at Santa Anita Park on January 3, 1946, Woolf fell from his horse, Please Me, as he rounded the clubhouse turn. Suffering from a concussion, he was taken to the hospital, where he died the following day. The jockeys in the race and the track stewards reported that they had not witnessed any incident during the race to have caused such a fall.  Most observers think his diabetic condition may have resulted in his suffering a dizzy spell or fainting.\n\nWoolf was buried at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in The Great Mausoleum, Gardenia Terrace, the Sanctuary of Providence, Mausoleum Crypt 9707 in Glendale, California. Western singing star Gene Autry sang at his funeral service.\n\nLegacy and honors\nThe death at age 35 of one of the country's best and most respected jockeys, and a favorite of fans, led to the creation of the George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award. During his career (1928\u20131946), Woolf had 3,784 mounts, 721 wins (19.1%), 589 seconds and 468 thirds, finishing in the money 46% of the time.\n\nIn 1950, a life-size bronze statue of Woolf was erected in his honor near the walking ring at Santa Anita Park. It was funded by donations from fans starting in 1948.\nIn 1955 Woolf was an inaugural inductee into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.\nIn 1956 he was inducted into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame.\nIn 1976, he was one of the inaugural class inducted into the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame.\nOn July 17, 2010, marking the 100th anniversary of Woolf's birth, a life-size equestrian statue was erected in his home town of Cardston, Alberta at its Remington Carriage Museum. The bronze work was donated by ranchers Jack and Ida Lowe, who had it made by the sculptor Don Toney. It depicts Woolf riding Seabiscuit to victory in the 1938 match race upset against War Admiral.\n\nRepresentation in other media\nWoolf is mentioned as one of the greatest jockeys of all times in the movie The Black Stallion (1979), directed by Carroll Ballard. The film was adapted from Walter Farley's 1941 children's novel of the same name.\nIn the film, Seabiscuit (2003), Woolf was portrayed by the jockey Gary Stevens, who has also been inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.  Stevens had won the George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award in 1996.\n\nSee also\nList of Canadian sports personalities\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n\"George Woolf/Seabiscuit memorial statue unveiling \u2013 July 17, 2010\", What's new at the Museum?, see Woolf/Seabiscuit statue on this page, Remington Carriage Museum\n\nCanadian jockeys\nCanadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame inductees\nUnited States Thoroughbred Racing Hall of Fame inductees\nSportspeople from Alberta\nCanadian people of German descent\n1910 births\n1946 deaths\nPeople from Cardston\nSports deaths in California\nBurials at Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)\nJockeys killed while racing", "machine_text": "George Woolf (May 17, 1910 \u2013 January 3, 1946) was a Canadian thoroughbred jockey and the first Canadian-born rider to be inducted into the U.S. Racing Hall of Fame. Known affectionately as the \"Iceman\" for his cool and unflappable demeanor on the track, Woolf is widely regarded as one of the greatest jockeys of all time. Born in Cardston, Alberta, Woolf began his career in horse racing at a young age. He apprenticed with his father, who was a trainer and jockey in Western Canada, and soon established himself as a skilled rider. In 1928, he made his debut at the Hastings Park racetrack in Vancouver and won his first race. Over the next several years, he competed in races across Canada and the United States, earning a reputation as a skilled and fearless jockey. However, Woolf is perhaps best known for his association with the legendary racehorse Seabiscuit. In 1936, Woolf met Seabiscuit's trainer Tom Smith and began riding the horse in races. Despite Seabiscuit's initial unimpressive record, Woolf believed in the horse's potential and worked tirelessly to educate him. His patience and skill paid off: in 1937, Seabiscuit won the Santa Anita Handicap and became a household name. Woolf continued to ride Seabiscuit until an injury forced him to take a break from racing in 1938. Tragically, Woolf's career was cut short when he died in a racing accident at Santa Anita Park in 1946. He was riding a horse named Please Me in a race when the horse collided with another horse and fell. Woolf suffered a fractured skull and died later that day. He was just 35 years old. Woolf's death was a shock to the horse racing world, and he was mourned by fans and fellow jockeys alike. In 1950, he was posthumously inducted into the U.S. Racing Hall of Fame, and he remains a beloved figure in racing history. Today, the George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award is given annually to a jockey who displays exceptional professionalism, integrity, and dedication to the sport.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1945547}

Campaigned exclusively in California, he was lightly raced in his early career, running twice a two-year-old in 2011 and once in the following year. As a four-year-old in 2013 he began by racing against moderate opposition before emerging as one of the best sprinters in North America with Grade I victories in the Bing Crosby Stakes and the Santa Anita Sprint Championship.  Preparing for the Breeders' Cup, he fractured his leg during a workout and was euthanized.  At the end of the year, he was posthumously named American Champion Sprint Horse.\n\nBackground\nPoints Offthebench was a lightly made dark bay or brown gelding with a white star bred in California by Gary Rocks. He was sired by Benchmark, a multiple graded stakes winner who had previously sired the Grade I winners Brother Derek (Santa Anita Derby) and Idiot Proof (Ancient Title Stakes). Points Offthebench is the second foal of the unraced mare Mo Chuisle: her first foal, Bench Points, won five races including the Grade III Lazaro Barrera Memorial Stakes. During his racing career, Points Offthebench was owned by Donnie Crievier and Charles V. Martin and trained by Tim Yakteen. He was considered a major contender for the Breeders' Cup Sprint but was fatally injured in a training accident at Santa Anita Park on October 26. Three months later, he was named American Champion Sprint Horse for 2013.\n\nRacing career\n\n2011: two-year-old season\nPoints Offthebench made two appearances as a two-year-old, both of them on the Polytrack surface at Del Mar Racetrack in August. He began in a five and a half furlong maiden race in which he started at odds of 4.1/1 and finished third of eight runners. Eighteen days later he appeared in a similar event over six furlongs in which he was ridden, as on his debut, by the Mexican jockey Alonso Quinonez. Starting the 2.4/1 second favorite, he raced just behind the leaders before taking the lead in the straight and winning by one and a quarter lengths.\n\n2012: three-year-old season\nPoints Offthebench began his second season in a six-and-a-half-furlong Optional claiming race on the dirt at Santa Anita Park on February 17. Ridden by Joel Rosario, he tracked the odds-on favorite, Three Vases, before taking the lead on the final turn and drawing away in the closing stages to win by two and a quarter lengths. He did not race again in 2012.\n\n2013: four-year-old season\nAlmost a year after his last race, Points Offthebench returned in a six-furlong claiming race at Santa Anita in which he finished second by half a length to the favored Italian Rules. In April, he was ridden by Tyler Baze in another claimer over six and a half furlongs at the same track and started second favorite at odds of 2.2/1 in a field of ten runners. He raced just behind the leaders before taking the lead in the straight and holding off the challenge of the favorite, Oliver's Tale, to win by half a length. The gelding remained in claiming company for his next race over six furlongs at Hollywood Park Racetrack on May 27. Ridden again by Baze, he took the lead in the straight and went clear in the closing stages to win by two and a quarter lengths from Cyclometer, with the favored Italian Rules a neck away in third.\n\nPoints Offthebench was then moved up sharply in class for the Grade I Bing Crosby Stakes over six furlongs at Del Mar on July 28 in which he was ridden for the first time by Mike Smith. The gelding was fourth choice in the betting for the race behind previous Grade I winners Goldencents (Santa Anita Derby), Jimmy Creed (Malibu Stakes), and Comma to the Top (CashCall Futurity). Points Offthebench tracked the leaders before moving up on the outside to take the lead entering the straight. In the closing stages, he was challenged by Goldencents but prevailed by a head, with a gap of over three lengths back to Jimmy Creed in third. Tim Yakteen, who recorded the first Grade I success of his eight-year training career, commented: \"He was training great, we drew a great post and he was ready for the task, so I felt confident going into the race. He ran huge and Mike gave him a great ride.\"\n\nOn October 5 at Santa Anita, Points Offthebench met Goldencents again in the Santa Anita Sprint Championship (formerly the Ancient Title Stakes) in a field which also included Breeders' Cup Sprint winner Trinniberg. Ridden again by Smith, the gelding moved up on the outside on the turn before overtaking the leader Distinctiv Passion in the final furlong. Despite lugging towards the inside in the closing stages, he held on to win by half a length from Goldencents. After the race, Smith commented: \"He has some turn of foot, and I hit the front too soon, but he still held on. He pulled up nice and happy, well within himself. He's a very talented horse.\"\n\nAfter four consecutive wins, including two at Grade I level, Points Offthebench was considered a leading contender for the Breeders' Cup Sprint at Santa Anita on November. In a routine four-furlong workout at the track on October 26, the gelding was approaching the sixteenth pole when he broke down on his right foreleg with what was described as \"an inordinately loud, sickening sound\". He had sustained a condlyar fracture to his right foreleg and was euthanized within fifteen minutes. His owner, Charles Martin, said, \"He's been a tremendous horse. He was the nicest horse you would ever find... He was as much a pet as an awesome racehorse... everyone in the barn is devastated\".\n\nAssessment and honors\nOn January 18, 2014, almost three month after his death, Points Offthebench was named American Champion Sprint Horse at the Eclipse Awards, taking 125 of the 249 votes. He was the first horse to be posthumously awarded an Eclipse Award since Left Bank in 2002. In the 2013 World's Best Racehorse Rankings, Points Offthebench was given a rating of 117, making him the highest-rated sprinter competing on dirt.\n\nPedigree\n\nReferences\n\n2009 racehorse births\n2013 racehorse deaths\nRacehorses bred in California\nRacehorses trained in the United States\nThoroughbred family 9-c\nEclipse Award winners", "machine_text": "Points Offthebench was an American Thoroughbred racehorse who competed from 2011 to 2014.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"The One with the Embryos\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "\"The One with the Embryos\" is the twelfth episode of Friends fourth season. It first aired on the NBC network in the United States on January 15, 1998. In the episode, Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) agrees to be the surrogate mother for her brother Frank Jr. (Giovanni Ribisi) and his older wife Alice Knight (Debra Jo Rupp). Meanwhile, a display by Chandler (Matthew Perry) and Joey (Matt LeBlanc) of how well they know Monica (Courteney Cox) and Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) by guessing the items in their shopping bag leads to a large-scale bet on a quiz, for which Ross (David Schwimmer) acts as the gamemaster.\n\nThe episode was directed by Kevin S. Bright and co-written by Jill Condon and Amy Toomin. The idea for Kudrow's character Phoebe becoming a surrogate mother coincided with the actress' real-time pregnancy. The producers wanted to find a way to use the pregnancy in a narrative for the fourth season and designated the task to the writers. Ribisi and Rupp reprised their recurring roles of Frank Jr. and Alice respectively which was initially difficult as both had filming commitments.\n\nIn its original broadcast on NBC, \"The One with the Embryos\" acquired a 17.3 Nielsen rating, finishing the week ranked fourth. The episode received critical acclaim, is generally considered one of the best of the entire series, and is a favorite amongst the cast members and producers. In 2009, \"The One with the Embryos\" was ranked #21 on TV Guide'''s list of \"TV's Top 100 Episodes of All Time.\"\n\nPlot\nRachel (Jennifer Aniston) and Monica (Courteney Cox) are woken up too early in the morning by Joey (Matt LeBlanc) and Chandler's (Matthew Perry) chick and duck, as the maturing chick has just begun crowing. Later, as Rachel returns with her shopping and complains to the others about the situation, Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) urges the boys to get rid of their birds as they should not be living in an apartment.\n\nAs Phoebe leaves for her doctor's appointment to get her brother Frank (Giovanni Ribisi) and his older wife Alice's (Debra Jo Rupp) embryo transferred into her uterus, Monica and Joey enter having an argument after Joey boasts that he and Chandler know more about Rachel and her than vice versa. Chandler backs Joey up, and the two correctly identify the contents of Rachel's shopping bag. Monica suggests a trivia contest to see who knows more about whom: the men or the women. They place a $100 bet on the outcome and Ross (David Schwimmer) puts together some questions and plays as host.\n\nMeanwhile, Phoebe learns that the doctor will implant five of Frank and Alice's embryos into her uterus, which only has a 25% chance of success. She offers to do this as many times as possible for them, but is concerned when the two reveal that they are paying $16,000, which is all of their savings, for the single IVF procedure, and is helpless to influence the results.\n\nThe trivia game begins, with various facts about the characters being revealed such as Joey's space-cowboy imaginary friend (Maurice) and Rachel's actual favorite movie (Weekend at Bernie's). A nine-all score leads to a lightning round. Monica raises the stakes: If the women win, Joey and Chandler must give up their birds. Chandler rebuts by suggesting Rachel and Monica give up their apartment to them, which Monica immediately agrees to without consulting Rachel. The girls lose the lightning round because they cannot identify Chandler's job, and the boys win.\n\nAs the four pack up their respective apartments\u2014Rachel, in particular, displeased about having to switch\u2014Phoebe returns home and takes a pregnancy test, though it is too soon for a result, so she sits in the apartment for several days waiting for another result. Later with packing complete, Rachel finally refuses to move as Frank and Alice come by with another pregnancy test. The boys and the girls begin to argue along with Ross, which is cut short when Phoebe emerges from the bathroom and joyfully announces she is pregnant, the mood turning to one of celebration.\n\nThe tag scene shows Rachel and Monica horrified at having to deal with living in Chandler and Joey's cramped and dirty apartment, while the boys are content to live in the girls' large apartment.\n\nProduction\n\n\"The One with the Embryos\" was co-written by Jill Condon and Amy Toomin and directed by Kevin S. Bright. In October 1997, Lisa Kudrow announced she and her husband Michel Stern were expecting their first child. When Marta Kauffman first learned of Kudrow's pregnancy, she was overjoyed and wanted to find a solution of incorporating it into the show without choosing to cover up. At the time of filming \"The One with the Embryos\" in December, Kudrow was four months pregnant and the writers discussed ways of narrating the pregnancy on the show, settling with Kudrow's character carrying her brother's embryos.\n\nAccording to David Crane, the story arc with Phoebe carrying Frank and Alice's baby was considered \"risky\". When the plot was first discussed, the main concern was whether it was \"too crazy \u2026 where's the line with Phoebe?\". Crane felt if it were not for the actors, the storyline would not have been believable. The producers found it difficult to get Giovanni Ribisi to reprise his role as Frank Jr. on a longer term basis because the actor had continuous filming commitments. A similar situation occurred with Debra Jo Rupp, who was named as a cast member in the upcoming period sitcom, That '70s Show on the Fox network.\n\nThe chick and the duck, who first appeared in \"The One with a Chick and a Duck\" as Chandler and Joey's pets were used \"as a spark\" for the main plot. The animals were originally intended for one episode but because the producers believed they got \"so much mileage out of them\", they made recurring appearances. As many television shows used similar fictional pets, the producers settled on a chicken and a duck as they were different.\n\nThe idea for the trivia contest came up in the writers' room, partially based on a real game that writer Seth Kurland watched his friends play. The \"Miss Chanandler Bong\" joke was inspired by an incident from Kurland's childhood when his surname was misspelled on an address label.\n\nKauffman told TV Guide the writers felt it was important that the trivia contest reveal new information about the characters \"otherwise it's just exposition.\" The answer \"Viva Las Gay-gas\" in response to 'What is the name of Chandler's dad's show in Vegas?' changed \"about a million times\" in drafts according to Crane. On the night the show was being filmed, writers continued to pitch for different answers in order to receive a better response from the audience. The staff found it difficult coming up with different points of view for each character as all wanted to win the game.\n\nThe writers decided to go through with the apartment switch to avoid creating fake stakes, which they called \"schmuck bait\". \"The discussion was if we do it, we have to stick to it,\" Crane said. There was never discussion of changing the look of either apartment because \"the fun of it was that they were in spaces they 'shouldn't' be in,\" according to Bright.\n\nReception\nIn its original airing, \"The One with the Embryos\" finished fourth in ratings for the week of January 12\u2013January 18, 1998, with a Nielsen rating of 17.3, equivalent to approximately 16.8 million viewing households. It was the fourth highest-rated show on NBC that week, following ER, Seinfeld and Veronica's Closet\u2013all of which aired on the network's Thursday night Must See TV lineup.\n\n\"The One with the Embryos\" was Courteney Cox and Matt LeBlanc's favorite episode of the series. Cox liked the episode because she enjoys playing Monica at her most competitive, while LeBlanc spoke fondly of the pace of the episode and the information about the characters that came out. He identified scenes that featured just the six core cast as the best, \"because you don't have to introduce a character\u2014you don't have to lay any pipeline\u2014you just get right to the funny\". On the DVD audio commentary for the episode, Marta Kauffman cited the episode being \"so much fun to do\" and enjoyed the writing process. The scene involving Phoebe talking to the embryos was Kevin S. Bright's favorite in the show's history because of Kudrow's ability to \"draw you into the scene ... even though it's only her talking to the dish\". David Crane highlights how the episode explores generosity; doing a selfless act which pays off when Phoebe  gives birth in \"The One Hundredth\". Bright moreover felt the trivia contest was the catalyst that rejuvenated the entire fourth season and \"put Friends in a different place\".\n\nIn a 2001 review, Entertainment Weekly rated the episode A+, stating that \"Thanks to the trivia contest alone, Embryos is quite possibly Friends' finest moment\". The article singles out Rachel's line \"He's a transpon\u2014transpondster!\" (in response to the question \"What is Chandler Bing's job?\") as the best line of the episode. The authors of Friends Like Us: The Unofficial Guide to Friends called it a \"sure-fire contender for the best episode of all time ... not one to be missed under any circumstances\". In 2004, Tara Ariano of MSNBC.com wrote that the character trivia is \"revealed in a manner completely organic to the plot. Beautifully written and acted, 'The One With The Embryos' encapsulates the whole series in a single episode\". The episode was ranked #21 on TV Guides list of \"TV's Top 100 Episodes of All Time\".\n\nIn a 2018 oral history marking the episode's 20th anniversary, TV Guide declared it the series' best episode and \"Friends'' at its peak, a lightning-in-a-bottle gem.\" Kauffman said she hopes \"the episode's legacy is what people would say about the series, which is it's really funny and real and sweet.\"\n\nMerchandise\nThe episode was released as part of Friends: The Complete Fourth Season in Regions 1, 2 and 4. As part of the DVD release, \"Who Knows Whom Best? \u2013 Ross's Ultimate Challenge\" an interactive game was included, based on the quiz in \"The One with the Embryos\". The game uses clips from the show to provide answers, allows viewers to choose a team (boys or girls) and call the coin toss.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\"The One with the Embryos\" at the Internet Movie Database\n\nFriends (season 4) episodes\n1998 American television episodes", "machine_text": "\"The One with the Embryos\" is the twelfth episode of the fourth season of the popular American sitcom Friends.

Additionally, the main storyline involves Phoebe, who agrees to carry her brother Frank Jr.'s triplets as a surrogate. The episode is widely regarded as one of the best in the entire series, earning an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series. It is also notable for the famous \"Lightning Round\" of questions, which became an iconic moment in Friends history. The episode begins with the friends watching an episode of Jeopardy!, with Ross being the only one who can answer the questions correctly. This leads to the group deciding to play their own trivia game, with Chandler and Joey competing against Monica and Rachel for the rights to the apartment. Throughout the game, the questions become increasingly difficult, leading to a series of bets and wagers between the friends. Ultimately, Chandler and Joey win the game and the apartment, consoling Monica and Rachel by promising to be good roommates and take them out to dinner. In the B-story, Phoebe agrees to carry her brother's triplets after his wife is unable to do so. The storyline is played for humor, with Phoebe making jokes about her pregnancy cravings and the awkwardness of explaining her situation to her friends. Overall, \"The One with the Embryos\" is a classic episode of Friends, showcasing the series' signature blend of humor and heart.

The linear approximation of a function is the first order Taylor expansion around the point of interest. In the study of dynamical systems, linearization is a method for assessing the local stability of an equilibrium point of a system of nonlinear differential equations or discrete dynamical systems.  This method is used in fields such as engineering, physics, economics, and ecology.\n\nLinearization of a function\nLinearizations of a function are lines\u2014usually lines that can be used for purposes of calculation. Linearization is an effective method for approximating the output of a function  at any  based on the value and slope of the function at , given that  is differentiable on  (or ) and that  is close to . In short, linearization approximates the output of a function near .\n\nFor example, . However, what would be a good approximation of ?\n\nFor any given function ,  can be approximated if it is near a known differentiable point. The most basic requisite is that , where  is the linearization of  at . The point-slope form of an equation forms an equation of a line, given a point  and slope . The general form of this equation is: .\n\nUsing the point ,  becomes . Because differentiable functions are locally linear, the best slope to substitute in would be the slope of the line tangent to  at .\n\nWhile the concept of local linearity applies the most to points arbitrarily close to , those relatively close work relatively well for linear approximations. The slope  should be, most accurately, the slope of the tangent line at .\n\nVisually, the accompanying diagram shows the tangent line of  at . At , where  is any small positive or negative value,  is very nearly the value of the tangent line at the point .\n\nThe final equation for the linearization of a function at  is:\n\nFor , . The derivative of  is , and the slope of  at  is .\n\nExample\nTo find , we can use the fact that . The linearization of   at  is , because the function  defines the slope of the function  at . Substituting in , the linearization at 4 is . In this case , so  is approximately .

For a system defined by the equation\n\n,\n\nthe linearized system can be written as\n\nwhere  is the point of interest and  is the Jacobian of  evaluated at .\n\nStability analysis\nIn stability analysis of autonomous systems, one can use the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix evaluated at a hyperbolic equilibrium point to determine the nature of that equilibrium. This is the content of the linearization theorem. For time-varying systems, the linearization requires additional justification.\n\nMicroeconomics\nIn microeconomics, decision rules may be approximated under the state-space approach to linearization. Under this approach, the Euler equations of the utility maximization problem are linearized around the stationary steady state. A unique solution to the resulting system of dynamic equations then is found.\n\nOptimization\nIn mathematical optimization, cost functions and non-linear components within can be linearized in order to apply a linear solving method such as the Simplex algorithm. The optimized result is reached much more efficiently and is deterministic as a global optimum.\n\nMultiphysics\nIn multiphysics systems\u2014systems involving multiple physical fields that interact with one another\u2014linearization with respect to each of the physical fields may be performed. This linearization of the system with respect to each of the fields results in a linearized monolithic equation system that can be solved using monolithic iterative solution procedures such as the Newton\u2013Raphson method.

By linearizing the equations that describe the system, engineers can identify the key variables that affect the system's behavior and make predictions about how it will perform in different situations. Linearization is an essential technique in control theory, where it is used to design controllers that regulate a system's behavior. There are various techniques for linearization, including Taylor series approximation, small-signal analysis, and linear regression. These techniques can be used to linearize a variety of mathematical models, including differential equations, power laws, and exponential functions. One of the main advantages of linearization is that it simplifies the model, making it easier to analyze and solve. However, the linear approximation may not be accurate for all values of the original function. The validity of the linear approximation depends on the range of values for which it is used. If the nonlinear function varies significantly in this range, the linear approximation may not provide an accurate result. Overall, linearization is a powerful tool that is used extensively in engineering, physics, and mathematics. Its applications range from predicting the behavior of control systems to analyzing the response of physical systems to external forces. While it has its limitations, linearization remains an essential technique for approximating complex nonlinear functions.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1118789}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Tessera (Venus)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "A tessera (plural tesserae) is a region of heavily deformed terrain on Venus, characterized by two or more intersecting tectonic elements, high topography, and subsequent high radar backscatter. Tesserae often represent the oldest material at any given location and are among the most tectonically deformed terrains on Venus's surface. Diverse types of tessera terrain exist. It is not currently clear if this is due to a variety in the interactions of Venus's mantle with regional crustal or lithospheric stresses, or if these diverse terrains represent different locations in the timeline of crustal plateau formation and fall. Multiple models of tessera formation exist and further extensive studies of Venus's surface are necessary to fully understand this complex terrain.\n\nExploration\nPioneer Venus Orbiter detected regions of anomalous radar properties and high backscatter. Using SAR imaging, the Venera 15 and Venera 16 orbiters revealed these regions to be chaotically tiled terrain, which Soviet scientists named \"\u043f\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0435\u0442\" (parquet), later known as \"tesserae.\" The most recent data concerning tessera terrain comes from the Magellan Mission, in which the majority of Venus's surface was mapped in high resolution (~100\u00a0m/pixel). Future missions to Venus would allow for further understanding of tessera terrain.\n\nLocations\nTesserae are recognized as covering 7.3% of Venus's surface, approximately 33.2\u00d7106 km, and occur mostly within a few extensive provinces. They are heavily concentrated between 0\u00b0E and 150\u00b0E. These longitudes represent a large area between a crustal extension center in the Aphrodite Terra and a crustal convergence center in Ishtar Terra. Tesserae are exposed almost entirely within Venus's crustal plateaus. Tessera inliers, regions of tessera not found within current crustal plateaus are thought to represent regions of collapsed crustal plateaus. Large regions of tessera terrain are labelled based on their latitude. Regions in the equatorial and southern latitudes are labelled as \"regio\" while regions in the northern latitudes are labelled as \"tesserae.\"\n\nA comprehensive list of regiones and tesserae can be found under List of geological features on Venus. Some well explored regions of tessera include:\nAphrodite Terra\nAlpha Regio\nBeta Regio\nFortuna Tessera\nOvda Regio\n\nFormation\n\nTesserae represent an ancient time of globally thin lithosphere on Venus. Tessera Terrain does not participate in the global resurfacing events of Venus. It was thought by many researches that the tesserae might form a global \"onion skin\" of sorts, and extended beneath Venus's regional plains. However, the currently accepted models support regional formation. Multiple models have been put forward to explain the formation of tessera terrain. Models of formation by mantle downwelling and pulsating continents are the most currently accepted models. A model of formation due to a lava pond via bolide impact was put forth, although it has not currently gained much traction in the scientific community due to skepticism of the ability of a bolide impact to generate sufficient melt. A model of formation due to mantle plumes (upwelling) was persistent for many years, however, it has since been abandoned due to its contradictory prediction of sequences of extension versus the observed cross cutting relationships.\n\nDownwelling\n\nIn the downwelling model, mantle downwelling, possibly due to mantle convection, causes compression and thickening of the crust, creating the compressional elements of tessera terrain. Isostatic rebound occurs due to the crustal thickening. After downwelling ends, a delamination event within the mantle produces extensional elements of tessera. This model does not currently explain tessera's location within crustal plateaus, and instead predicts a domical shape.\n\nLava pond via giant impact\nIn the lava pond via giant impact model, melt due to a bolide impact on a thin lithosphere rises to the surface to form a lava pond. Convection throughout the lava pond resulted in surface deformation that created tessera terrain. Isostatic rebound of the solidified pond creates a crustal plateau structure. This model does not currently explain how convection could transmit enough force to deform several kilometers of brittle material.\n\nPulsating continents\n\nIn the pulsating continents model, differentiated, low density crust survives early global subduction events forming continental regions. These regions undergo compression due to heating from the surrounding mantle, forming the compressional features of tessera, such as fold and thrust belts, and basin dome terrain. After sufficient crustal thickening has occurred, new lithosphere is generated causing gravitational collapse, producing the extensional features of tessera, such as extensive grabens. During this collapse, decompression causes partial melting, producing the intratessera volcanism seen within the larger regions of tessera terrain. This model requires that the material comprising tessera terrain is continental in nature. Future missions to Venus to sample surface compositions are necessary to support this model. This model does not currently explain how a global subduction event could cause the delamination of the entire mantle lithosphere, leaving only low density crust behind.\n\nVariety of tessera terrain\nIndividual patterns of tessera terrain record the variations in interactions of the mantle with local regional stresses. This variation manifests itself in a wide array of diverse terrain types. Multiple types of sampled tessera terrain are below, however, they are not meant as a classification scheme, and instead emphasize the variety of terrain types.\n\nFold Terrain is easily recognizable by its well defined linear fabrics. This type of terrain is composed of long ridges and valleys, greater than 100\u00a0km long, that are cross cut by minor extensional fractures that run perpendicular to the fold axes of the ridges. This likely formed due to unidirectional contraction.\n\nLava Flow Terrain is named such due to its resemblance to Pahoehoe flows found on Earth, with long curving ridges. It is thought that this terrain may be formed due to displacement and deformation due to movement of the material beneath these crustal pieces.\n\nRibbon Terrain is characterized by ribbons and folds that are typically orthogonal to one another. Ribbons are long and narrow extensional troughs that are separated by narrow ridges. Ribbon terrain can be found both in large crustal plateaus and within tessera inliers.\n\nS-C Terrain is named such due to its geometric similarity to S-C tectonic fabrics on Earth. It consists of two main structures: synchronous folds and small, 5 to 20\u00a0km long graben that cross cut the folds perpendicularly. Unlike many other types of tessera terrain, S-C terrain indicates a simple, rather than complex deformation history in which deformation due to widespread motion on Venus is widely distributed. This type of terrain also indicates that strike-slip movement on Venus's surface is possible.\n\nBasin and Dome Terrain, also known as honeycomb terrain, consists of curved ridges and troughs that form a pattern analogous to an egg carton. These structures represent multiple phases of deformation, and are considered the most complex appearing style of tessera. Basin and dome terrain is typically found within the center of crustal plateaus.\n\nStar Terrain is composed of multiple graben and fractures that trend in many directions, but radiate in a star-like pattern. This pattern is thought to be due to doming underneath previously deformed and fractured areas, in which the local uplift causes the radiating pattern.\n\nReferences\n\nGeology of Venus", "machine_text": "Tessera (Venus) is a type of geological formation on the planet Venus. Tesserae are the most complex type of feature on the planet's surface, composed of a central area of highly deformed rock with a complex pattern of ridges and valleys surrounded by a less deformed outer region. They are typically highly elevated, with steep cliffs that may rise several kilometers above the surrounding terrain. The word \"tessera\" is derived from a Latin term meaning \"tile\" or \"mosaic piece,\" referencing the complex pattern of the terrain. Tesserae were first discovered in high-resolution radar images taken by the Magellan spacecraft in the 1990s. They are believed to be tectonic features, formed by the collision and compression of the planet's crust. Tesserae are found in three main regions of Venus: Alpha Regio, Ovda Regio, and Thetis Regio. They are surrounded by a variety of other geological features, including volcanic plains, impact craters, and lava flows. The exact processes by which tesserae form are still a subject of active research, but it is clear that they are shaped by both horizontal and vertical movements in the planet's crust. One striking feature of tesserae is their age. Radiometric dating of rocks from tesserae in Alpha Regio suggest that they are some of the oldest features on the planet, dating back around 4 billion years. This has led some scientists to speculate that tesserae may hold clues to the early geological history of Venus, before catastrophic global resurfacing events erased much of the planet's surface features. Despite their geological interest, tesserae are not believed to be a good target for future exploration of Venus, due to their high elevation and rugged terrain. However, continued study of their formation and evolution will likely shed new light on the geological processes that shape our planetary neighbors.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 45252110}

Its headquarters are located in Traun, Upper Austria. The company is a family business, currently run by the third generation.\n\nInternorm distributes its products through 10 sales offices and more than 1,300 selected sales partners in 22 countries. 55% of its sales are generated through exports.\n\nHistory \nInternorm started when its founder, Eduard Klinger Sr. established a building and construction workshop in Linz, in 1931. In the following years, Eduard Klinger Sr. expanded his company from a one-man operation to a medium-sized metal construction company. In 1963, seeing the potential of pioneering products made from UPVC (unplasticized polyvinyl chloride), he acquired the first license for the construction of UPVC window frames in Austria.\n\nThe company, under the name of \"Internorm\", started producing UPVC windows in 1966. The first production site was in Traun, the location of the company's headquarters. In 1967, Eduard Klinger Sr. gave each of his three children, Eleonore, Eduard and Helmut a 25% holding in the company. Under the leadership of the second generation, Internorm developed into the market leader for windows and doors in Austria. The rapid growth of the company required a second production site, which Internorm found through the acquisition in 1977 of a local window manufacturer in Sarleinsbach. A third plant was set up in Lannach, Styria, in 1982. In 1988, the first Internorm timber windows were produced in this plant. Today, the plant specializes in Timber/Aluminium products.\n\nIn 1997, the 2nd generation left the operations side of the business and joined the supervisory board, each being replaced by one of their children \u2013 Anette Klinger, Christian Klinger and Stephan Kubinger \u2013 on the executive board. In 2001, Internorm reached a figure of 10 million products sold.\n\nIn 2002, Internorm founded the \"International Windows Network (IFN)\", a new umbrella company to which Internorm belongs to. Other independent and specialist companies emerged alongside Internorm with the goal of developing synergies for sharing knowledge and innovations. The group has around 2,900 employees, with approximately 1,800 of them working at Internorm.\n\nDistribution \n\nInternorm has its own sales offices in Austria, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, France, Slovenia, Croatia, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Great Britain.

Internorm also manufactures sliding, balcony and side entrance doors and a range of accessories such as sun protection, insect repellent and window and door handles.\n\nThe products are marketed in four design styles: Studio, Home Pure, Home Soft and Ambiente.\n\nIn 2012, Internorm launched a series of technologies marketed under the name \"I-tec\". These include a new locking system with invisible fitting and higher safety, a ventilation system integrated into the window and an energy-efficient shading system for composite windows. With an intelligent building control, the Internorm products can be conveniently controlled via tablet or smartphone.\n\nFacilities \nThe headquarters of \"International Window Network (IFN)\" and \"Internorm International GmbH\" are located at the Traun site.  The management, the board of directors and all the administrative sectors are located here. In addition to UPVC and UPVC/aluminium windows, specialized UPVC products (round and angular windows), windows with integrated blinds, aluminium window shutters, aluminium doors and insulating glass are manufactured here.\n\nThe plant in Sarleinsbach was opened in 1977. Internorm is the largest employer in this region with around 650 employees. More than 3,000 units of UPVC and UPVC/Aluminium windows are manufactured here per day.\n\nIn the Lannach production plant, the manufacture of timber/aluminium windows and timber/aluminium doors takes place.

Only sporadically making first team appearances for his contracted club, Ginnelly has spent a number of years on loan at different clubs, including Altrincham, Lincoln City, Tranmere Rovers, and Bristol Rovers.\n\nClub career\n\nShrewsbury Town\nBorn in Nuneaton, England, Ginnelly began his career at Aston Villa, where he spent seven years. Following his release from the Aston Villa youth system, Ginnelly began a two-year scholarship with Shrewsbury Town in 2013.\n\nAt the start of his Shrewsbury Town career, Ginnelly was immediately assigned to the club's youth team. He quickly impressed for the youth side, and subsequently was called up to the first team by manager Michael Jackson. Ginnelly appeared as an unused substitute in the last game of the season, in a 1\u20131 draw against Gillingham.\n\nGinnelly made his Football League debut under manager Micky Mellon on 30 August 2014, coming on as a late substitute for James Collins in a 2\u20130 win over Luton Town at the New Meadow. After the match, he said making his professional debut was a \"dream come true\". Local newspaper, Shropshire Star, praised Ginnelly's performance for his technical ability, quoting: \"bringing down a long ball with his first touch before showing ambition by taking on two Luton defenders.\" However, Ginnelly only appeared two more times later in the 2014\u201315 season. He was awarded the club's Youth Player of the Year at the award ceremony.\n\nHe was offered his first professional contract in March 2015, but he failed to return to training the following pre-season with his contract situation unresolved.\n\nBurnley\nGinnelly was reported to be having trials with Norwich City, and Burnley, and joined the latter for an undisclosed fee on a three-year deal on 10 August 2015.\n\nGinnelly was released by Burnley following the expiration of his contract after three years at the club, without making a first team appearance for the side.\n\nAltrincham (loan)\nOn 8 January 2016, Ginnelly joined National League side Altrincham on an initial one-month loan. He made his debut on 23 January 2016 in a 5\u20130 win over Grimsby Town, playing the entire game. Ginnelly scored his first goal for the club three days later in a 3\u20131 win over Woking. He then scored two goals in two matches between 9 February 2016 and 13 February 2016 against Wrexham and Lincoln City respectively. During a match against Barrow on 12 March 2016, Ginnelly was the subject of racist abuse by opposition fans, prompting a police investigation. Despite this, he had his loan spell at the club extended until the end of the season, having previously extended the previous month. Ginnelly scored two more goals later in the season as he went on to make twenty appearances and scored five times in all competitions \u2013 Altrincham were however still relegated from the division.\n\nWalsall (loan) \nOn 28 July 2016, Ginnelly signed for Football League One side Walsall on loan until January 2017. He made his Walsall debut on 30 August 2016, a 72nd-minute substitute, in a 5\u20132 win over Grimsby Town in the Football League Trophy. He spent much of the start of the season on the bench, finally making his league debut on 15 October 2016 in a 3\u20132 victory over his former club Shrewsbury. His performance earned him a run of games for the club, however he returned to Burnley in January 2017 having failed to make an appearance since November.\n\nLincoln City (loan) \nOn 30 January 2017, Ginnelly signed for National League leaders Lincoln City on loan until the end of the season. He made his Lincoln City debut, playing the whole game (and played a role that led to Terell Thomas scoring an own goal), in a 3\u20132 win over Woking on 11 February 2017. He made a total of seventeen appearances in all competitions as Lincoln finished as champions.\n\nOn 26 June 2017, Ginnelly re-joined Lincoln City on a season long loan for the 2017\u201318 season. Ginnelly scored his first goal for Lincoln on the first day of the following season in a 2\u20132 draw with Wycombe Wanderers on 5 August 2017. After suffering ankle injury that kept him out throughout August, he returned from injury on 9 September 2017, where he came on as a substitute, in a 2\u20131 win over Stevenage. It wasn't until 7 November 2017 when he scored again in a 2\u20131 win over Notts County in the Football League Trophy. A month later, on 26 December 2017, Ginnelly scored his third goal of the season, in a 3\u20130 win over Stevenage. However, he appeared in and out of the starting eleven, and faced competition from other players, including loanee signing Danny Rowe. As a result, he was recalled by Burnley, making nineteen total appearances and scoring three times in his second loan spell at Lincoln City.\n\nTranmere Rovers (loan) \nOn 12 January 2018, he signed a loan deal with Tranmere Rovers until the end of the season. Ginnelly scored on his Tranmere Rovers debut eight days after joining the club, in a 3\u20132 win over Maidenhead United. Despite losing his first team place between late\u2013March and mid\u2013April, he returned to the starting lineup on 21 April 2018, in a 2\u20130 win over Halifax Town. In the play-off semi-final, Ginnelly scored in a 4\u20132 win over Ebbsfleet. Ginnelly played the entirety of the National League play-off final, helping the side beat Boreham Wood 2\u20131 at Wembley and ensuring the club's return to the EFL after a three-year absence. He went on to make 12 appearances and scoring two times for the side.\n\nWalsall\nAfter being released by Burnley at the end of the 2017\u201318 season, it was announced on 5 June 2018 that Ginnelly signed a one\u2013year contract at former loan club Walsall. Upon joining the club, he revealed that Manager Dean Keates convinced him to re-join Walsall, citing his style of management.\n\nGinnelly's first game after re-signing for the club came in the opening game of the season, where he started the match and played 84 minutes, in a 2\u20131 win over Plymouth Argyle. It wasn't until 14 August 2018 when he scored his first goal for the club, in a 3\u20131 win over Tranmere Rovers in the first round of the League Cup. A week later, on 25 August 2018, Ginnelly scored again, in a 3\u20131 win over Rochdale. Ginnelly quickly became a first team regular, playing in an attacking role, and formed a partnership with Luke Leahy.\n\nPreston North End\n\nOn 1 January 2019, he signed a two-and-a-half year contract with Preston North End for an undisclosed fee, keeping him at the club until the end of the 2020\u201321 season.\n\nBristol Rovers (loan)\n\nGinnelly joined League One club Bristol Rovers on a six-month loan deal on 16 January 2020.\n\nHeart of Midlothian (loan)\n\nOn 2 September 2020, Ginnelly signed for then Scottish Championship club Heart of Midlothian on a season-long loan.\n\nHeart of Midlothian \nIn June 2021, Josh Ginnelly signed a two-year contract with newly-promoted Hearts after being released by previous club Preston.\n\nCareer statistics\n\nHonours\nLincoln City\nNational League: 2016\u201317\nTranmere Rovers\nNational League Playoffs: 2017-18\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n1997 births\nLiving people\nFootballers from Coventry\nEnglish footballers\nAssociation football midfielders\nShrewsbury Town F.C. players\nBurnley F.C. players\nAltrincham F.C. players\nWalsall F.C. players\nLincoln City F.C. players\nTranmere Rovers F.C. players\nPreston North End F.C. players\nBristol Rovers F.C. players\nEnglish Football League players\nNational League (English football) players\nHeart of Midlothian F.C. players\nScottish Professional Football League players", "machine_text": "Josh Ginnelly is a British professional footballer who currently plays as a winger for League Two club Walsall.

Corey Burton (as Volteer), Kevin Michael Richardson (as Terrador and Gaul) and Mae Whitman (as Cynder, featuring recycled voice clips of Cree Summer from its predecessor) were also confirmed to be part of the cast during Sierra Gamers' Week 2007.\n\nGameplay \n \nThe gameplay is similar to its predecessor. Spyro must travel to the end of a level in a linear fashion and defeat the boss at the end of each level, defeating enemies with his combat moves. However, there is a much larger emphasis on exploration and puzzle-solving.\n\nSpyro will learn different breaths from the Chronicler, who is met in Dreams which occur to Spyro during the course of the game.

In The Eternal Night, a new antagonist \u2014 \"Gaul\" the Ape King \u2014 has risen to power and is intent on resurrecting the Dark Master on The Night of Eternal Darkness.\n\nPlot\nThe story continues with Spyro following Cynder through the swamp surrounding the Dragon Temple. Spyro catches up with her and asks her not to leave. Cynder says she's sorry for what she had done in the previous game and wishes to find out where she belongs in the world, currently believing that she does not belong at the temple. She runs off, leaving Sparx and Spyro alone. Soon after she is gone, the Temple is attacked by the apes. After Spyro repels the attack, Ignitus, the leader of the dragons and master of fire, sends Spyro to seek out a tree that Spyro saw in a vision (in the dreams to follow, he gets his powers back, as he lost them at the end in A New Beginning) while Ignitus looks for help against the Apes. As Spyro searches for the tree, he also searches for another dragon known as the Chronicler, who asked Spyro in the same vision to find him. When he finds the tree (in the Game Boy Advance version, he falls into a cave), it suddenly turns into a tree monster known as Arborick (the Game Boy Advance version calls the monster Naga) and attacks Spyro, but although Arborick was killed, Spyro is captured by pirates, and is taken on board their ship to take part in gladiatorial combat.\n\nAfter Spyro defeats a third enemy in the arena, he is made to fight Cynder, whom the pirates captured as well. Before they can think of a plan to escape together, the pirate ship is suddenly attacked by the apes, who capture Cynder. After Spyro escapes the ship and defeats the pirate captain, Skabb. He discovers that the Apes have established a base on the Mountain of Malefor, also known as the Well Of Souls, in an effort to revive the Dark Master using a lunar alignment called the Night of Eternal Darkness. He also discovers that they are keeping Cynder prisoner hoping to turn her to their side.\n\nSpyro eventually finds the Chronicler, who tells him about the Dark Master. According to him, the Dark Master was the first purple dragon; his raw power allowed him to master practically every elemental power. When his growth failed to stop, he was exiled and sealed away by the dragon elders, but not before he taught the Apes how to use dragon magic. The Chronicler wants Spyro to hide from the Dark Master until a later time, but Spyro insists on going to Cynder's aid.\n\nWhen he gets to the mountain, Gaul, the Ape King, orders Cynder to attack Spyro. When she attacks Gaul instead, he knocks her out and challenges Spyro himself. During the fight, the lunar alignment occurs, and the evil energy it generates is channeled through Spyro, which turns him into his dark self.  He uses his immense power to turn Gaul to stone then blast his body apart, killing him, then leaps back into the beam of evil energy. Cynder awakens and knocks Spyro out of the beam, freeing him from the beam's power. When the alignment passes, the mountain begins to crumble around Spyro, Sparx, and Cynder. Remembering the Chronicler's words about riding out the storm, Spyro uses his powers to encase himself, Cynder, and Sparx in crystal to protect them as the Well of Souls collapses. After the credits, the trio are shown in the crystal while someone is watching as the Chronicler says that when Spyro awakens, the world would be different, but also assures him that he is not alone; he has allies. The story concludes in the final game Dawn of the Dragon.\n\nReception \n\nThe Eternal Night received \"mixed or average\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \n \n \n\n2007 video games\nAction-adventure games\nGame Boy Advance games\nNintendo DS games\nPlayStation 2 games\nEternal Night\nSierra Entertainment games\nUniversal Interactive games\nVideo game sequels\nKrome Studios games\nVideo games developed in Australia\nVideo games developed in the United States\nWii games\nVideo games about dreams\n3D platform games\n\nde:Spyro#The Legend of Spyro: The Eternal Night (2007)\nnl:De Legende van Spyro", "machine_text": "The Legend of Spyro: The Eternal Night is an action-adventure game that was developed by Krome Studios and released by Sierra Entertainment in 2007.

The concept of Judge, Jury, and Executioner dates back to ancient times when people had to take justice into their own hands. The phrase generally suggests that the same person holds the power to arrest, judge, and execute a verdict. The practice is illegal in many countries and punishable by law. During the medieval era, the authority to judge witnesses, offenders, and the victim lay solely on the monarch. Henry VIII was a famous example of a monarch who supported the rights of Judge, Jury, and Executioner. Later on, the concept started to become more nuanced, and as a result, rights of the various parties involved in the justice system started to become better protected. However, there have been several instances throughout history where people have been granted the power to act as Judge, Jury, and Executioner. Vigilante groups have taken justice into their own hands and inflicted punishment with no legal authority. The result was that innocent people would end up being punished without proper or fair trial. Currently, the concept of Judge, Jury, and Executioner is not acceptable. Everyone, regardless of the crime they are accused of committing, has the right to a fair trail and legal representation. The role of the judge is to pass judgement while the Jury decides whether the accused is guilty or not guilty. It is the responsibility of the legal system to enact the punishment or carry out the sentences appropriately. In conclusion, the concept of Judge, Jury, and Executioner has evolved throughout history, and while it may have been acceptable once, it is not acceptable now.

The company was founded on January 1, 1894, and was owned by the Dominion Coal Company and the Dominion Iron and Steel Company. The railway line stretched from Yarmouth in the south to the Annapolis Valley in the north, with branches to the mining areas in the Sydney and Glace Bay regions. One of the notable features of the Dominion Atlantic Railway was the use of standard gauge track, which made it possible to connect with other railways and the port of Halifax. The railway had a well-established passenger service, with trains running from Halifax to Yarmouth and on to Saint John, New Brunswick. The company faced many challenges during its operation, including financial difficulties and damage caused by natural disasters such as floods and hurricanes. In 1917, the railway was taken over by the Canadian Government Railways due to financial difficulties. This resulted in major changes to the structure and operation of the railway. After several ownership changes and mergers, the Dominion Atlantic Railway was finally absorbed by the Canadian National Railway in 1994. The DAR's legacy can be seen in the numerous abandoned rail lines that are still visible throughout Nova Scotia. In addition to being an essential transportation system for the forestry and mining industries, the Dominion Atlantic Railway played a vital role in the social and economic development of Nova Scotia.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Formyl peptide receptor\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The formyl peptide receptors (FPR) belong to a class of G protein-coupled receptors involved in chemotaxis.  In humans, there are three formyl peptide receptor isoforms, each encoded by a separate gene that are named FPR1, FPR2, and FPR3. These receptors were originally identified by their ability to bind N-formyl peptides such as N-formylmethionine produced by the degradation of either bacterial or host cells.  Hence formyl peptide receptors are involved in mediating immune cell response to infection.  These receptors may also act to suppress the immune system under certain conditions. The close phylogenetic relation of signaling in chemotaxis and olfaction was recently proved by detection formyl peptide receptor like proteins as a distinct family of vomeronasal organ chemosensors in mice.\n\nFPR is now properly accepted as termed FPR1 by the International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology.\n\nDiscovery \n\nStudies conducted in the 1970s found that a series of N-Formylmethionine-containing oligopeptides, including the most potent and best known member of this series, N-formylmethionine-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLF or fMet-Leu-Phe), stimulated rabbit and human neutrophils by an apparent receptor-dependent mechanism to migrate in a directional pattern in classical laboratory assays of chemotaxis. Since these oligopeptides were produced by bacteria or synthetic analogs of such products, it was suggested that the N-formyl oligopeptides are important chemotatic factors and their receptors are important chemotactic factor receptors that act respectively as signaling and signal-recognizing elements to initiate inflammation responses in order to defend against bacterial invasion.  Further studies defined a receptor for the N-formyl oligopeptides, formyl peptide receptor (FPR), so named based on its ability to bind and become activated by the oligopeptides.  Two receptors where thereafter discovered and named FPR1 and FPR2 based on the similarity of their genes' predicted amino acid sequence to that of FPR rather than on any ability to bind or be activated by the formyl oligopeptides. These three receptors have been renamed as FPR1, FPR2, and FPR3 and found to have very different specificities for the formyl oligopeptides and very different functions that include initiating inflammatory  responses to N-formyl peptides released not only by bacteria but also a multiplicity of elements released by host tissues; dampening and resolving inflammatory responses; and perhaps contributing to the development of certain neurological cancers and an array of neurological diseases Amyloid-based diseases.\n\nStructure and function \n\nThe formyl peptide receptor (FPR) belongs to the class of receptors possessing seven hydrophobic transmembrane domains. The conformation of the FPR is stabilized by several interactions. These include potential salt bridge formation between Arg84-Arg205, Lys85-Arg205, and Lys85-Asp284 which help determine the three-dimensional structure of transmembrane domains, as well as positively charged residues (Arg, Lys) which interact with negatively charged phosphates.  Furthermore, residue Arg163 may interact with the ligand binding pocket of the second extracellular loop of the FPR.\n\nWith respect to binding of the formyl Met-Leu-Phe peptide, there are additional potential interactions which include hydrogen bonding interactions between Arg84 and Lys85 of the first extracellular loop and the N-formyl group of the ligand as well as the peptide backbone of formyl Met-Leu-Phe which can form similar interactions. The formyl-Met moiety of the ligand was shown to form disulfide bridges with Cys residues, and an interaction with Arg163 was also demonstrated. (It is important to mention that some interaction which stabilize the conformation of the receptor may also influence ligand-binding.) Some oligopeptides were also described as characteristic constituents linked to Asn-s of the extracellular N terminal part and to the ligand binding pocket of the second extracellular loop. These components can also determine or make more specific the ligand-receptor interaction.\n\nSignaling pathways \nInduction of FPR triggers multiple changes in eukaryotic cells including rearrangement of the cytoskeleton which in turn facilitates cell migration and the synthesis of chemokines. \nImportant FPR regulated pathways include:\n G protein dependent activation of phospholipase C (PLC) which results in the breakdown of the membrane constituent phospholipid, phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2) into inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacyl glycerol (DAG). IP3 is one of the most effective inducers of Ca2+ increase from cytoplasmic pools and from outside the cell via opening Ca2+ channels. DAG in turn is an inducer of protein kinase C (PKC).\n Activation of the regulatory small GTPase, RAS.  The active RAS can in turn activate RAF, a Ser/Thr kinase. In the next step mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAP kinases) are activated. (Also known as extracellular signal-regulated kinases - ERKs or MAP/ERK kinase (MEK)). As a result of the last step, ERK1 and ERK2 are activated. The phosphorylated forms of ERKs can continue the cascade by triggering activation more interacting kinases which results in altered transcriptional activity in the nucleus.\n Ligand binding to FPR can also induce the activation of CD38, an ectoenzyme of the surface membrane.  As a result of activation NAD+ molecules will enter the cytoplasm. NAD+ is converted into cyclic ADP ribose (cADPR), a second messenger which interacts with ryanodine receptors (RyR) on the surface of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The overall result of the process is increased cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels via the direct pathway described above and also via indirect pathways such as opening of Ca2+ channels in the cell membrane. The sustained increase of Ca2+ is required for directed migration of the cells.\n\nSee also \n Chemotaxis Receptors\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\n \n\nG protein-coupled receptors", "machine_text": "Formyl peptide receptor (FPR) is a family of 7-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in human and other mammalian cells, which is responsible for recognizing and binding peptide ligands produced by bacteria and host cells during inflammation and infection. The FPR family consists of three members: FPR1, FPR2, and FPR3. These receptors are expressed on various cell types including neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, and epithelial cells. Upon binding to their ligands, FPRs activate intracellular signaling pathways, leading to diverse biological responses such as chemotaxis, phagocytosis, degranulation, and cytokine production. FPR ligands are mainly produced by bacteria that activate the innate immune system. These include the bacterial peptides fMLF (N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine) and its derivatives, which are highly conserved among pathogenic and commensal bacteria. Endogenous host-derived peptides, such as annexin A1-derived peptides (e.g. Ac2-26), also activate FPRs during inflammation. FPRs are involved in host defense against bacterial infection and play critical roles in regulating inflammatory responses. FPR1, the most studied receptor, is expressed abundantly in neutrophils and is activated by the bacterial peptide fMLF. FPR1 is involved in the migration of neutrophils to sites of infection, as well as in the phagocytosis of bacterial pathogens. FPR2 and FPR3 have a broader expression pattern and are activated by a variety of ligands, including endogenous proteins, lipids, and peptides, in addition to bacterial peptides. Dysregulation of FPR signaling has been implicated in various inflammatory diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and sepsis. As a result, FPRs are being explored as potential targets for therapeutic intervention in these and other inflammatory conditions. In conclusion, the FPR family is a critical component of innate immunity and plays key roles in host defense against bacterial infection and the regulation of inflammatory responses. Future research in this field will undoubtedly contribute to a better understanding of FPR signaling pathways and their therapeutic potential.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 9771642}

Born in Geneva in 1976, Hansmeyer was educated in Switzerland and the United States, where he studied architecture and computer science at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich and Cornell University, respectively. Hansmeyer's interest in computational design began in the early 2000s, when he began experimenting with algorithms to generate complex and intricate forms. His early projects included the design of a pavilion for the Swiss National Expo in 2002, which featured a complex pattern of interlocking wooden panels. One of Hansmeyer's most notable projects is his work on the Grotto II series, which consists of a series of 3D-printed architectural columns that are based on algorithmic generation and refinement. Each column is composed of over eight million polygons, and features intricate branching structures that evoke natural forms such as coral reefs and fractal patterns. Hansmeyer's work has been exhibited at numerous international exhibitions, including the Venice Biennale and the Centre Pompidou in Paris. He has also been recognized with a number of awards and honors for his contributions to computational design, including the Swiss Art Award, the Ars Electronica Honorary Mention, and the Architizer A+ Award. In addition to his work as an architect and designer, Hansmeyer is also a leading researcher and educator in the field of computational design.

The dewlap of S. visiri extends up to 56% of its trunk, which is proportionally larger than that of Sitana ponticeriana, S. bahiri, and S. devakai. S. visiri is differentiated from the species in the ponticeriana clade in having a larger snout-vent length.\n\nEcology\nSitana visiri is endemic to the Tamil Nadu region of India where it lives in coastal sand dunes, grasslands, plains, and areas dominated by Prosopis juliflora. S. visiri occurs in similar regions alongside Eutropis carinata, Eutropis bibronii, and Calotes versicolor.

The lizard is small, with an average length of 4.1 cm from snout to vent. It has a slender body, long tail, and elongated limbs. The dorsal side of its body is covered with small, rounded, keeled scales. The coloration of the lizard is variable, ranging from light to dark brown. The ventral side of the body is typically pale yellow or white. Sitana visiri is diurnal and primarily arboreal. It is commonly found in dry deciduous forests and scrublands. Females of the species lay a single egg, which hatch after an incubation period of approximately 50 days. The lizard is listed as \"data deficient\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) due to the lack of information available on its population size and trends. The species is believed to be threatened by habitat loss due to deforestation and human development. In recent years, Sitana visiri and other members of the Sitana genus have gained attention from researchers studying the evolutionary processes of lizards. Their unique adaptations and divergent morphologies have made them a valuable organism for studying convergent and parallel evolution.

The program begins with an opening hymn (sung by a choir, which includes audience members during live performances, accompanied by a reed organ), followed by an advertisement for upcoming events at the Renfro Valley Entertainment Center; this is followed by a listing of listeners' birthdays and anniversaries (limited to those 75 years or older or married 50 years or longer). The remainder of the program is themed, with the host reading short stories and monologues between folk, gospel and old-time country music performed by the show's house band. Most songs are vocal; an instrumental will sometimes close out the show. Other than the ad for the entertainment center, there are no commercials, nor is there any space for local stations to insert their own advertisements.\n\nPrior to 2011, the show was produced as a live stage performance. The current incarnation of the program is recorded entirely in a studio up to two months ahead of its air date and features studio recorded music, with almost all of it selected from a very limited playlist of approximately ten songs (most of which feature the host's wife, Pam Perry Combs, on lead vocals). The live version of the show is scheduled to return in May 2013.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Gatherin' program was founded by John Lair, former producer of the National Barn Dance, who founded the Renfro Valley Barn Dance and what would become the Renfro Valley Entertainment Center around it in 1939.  The Gatherin''' was first broadcast via the CBS Radio Network in September 1943.  The Gatherin' was, and is, a thematic program.  The original concept of the show was to recreate the atmosphere of the pioneer \"getherin's\" which were held in Renfro Valley \"in the days of long ago.\"  At the start, CBS wanted a Sunday morning companion program to the popular Saturday night Renfro Valley Barn Dance which would not be strictly a religious program, but would fit the Sunday morning format of the time.  The \"Gatherin'\" was John Lair's answer to this.  During this time, both shows were headquartered at WHAS in Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nJohn Lair was the first permanent emcee of the \"Gatherin',\" and there have so far only been three others; Grant Turner, Jim Gaskin, and Wayne Combs. Gaskin died on Saturday, May 3, 2008 at the age of 70 following a long illness. From then until approximately 2013, the Gatherin' was emceed by Wayne Combs, who is also an entertainer on the Barn Dance and other Renfro Valley shows, and a DJ at WRVK. For 2014 and 2015 episodes, Billy Keith hosted the show. The 2016 host is Scotty Bussell.\n\nAfter CBS Radio dropped the show at the end of the old-time radio era in 1957, a pre-recorded version of the Gatherin program went into syndication.  Meanwhile, a stage version of the show was, until approximately 2011, presented in the Old Barn Theater on Sunday mornings at 8:30.  The syndicated broadcast of the Gatherin''' is still heard on scores of stations across the United States and Canada, as well as on satellite radio and Internet broadcasts.  Following the departure of CBS, and former originating station WHAS of Louisville, from Renfro Valley in 1957, John Lair partnered with Tom Hargis to found WRVK in Renfro Valley, in part to serve as the Gatherin's and the Barn Dance's new flagship station, but mainly to serve the local listening audience in Rockcastle County, Kentucky.  The station first went on the air as a 500 watt daytime only AM station in April, 1957, utilizing the former WHAS/CBS studio in what was then the Pioneer Museum Building in Renfro Valley.\n\nRenfro Valley Entertainment Center\n\nRenfro Valley Entertainment Center, the home of the Gatherin' and Barn Dance, has been under separate ownership from WRVK since 1978.  At that time the radio station's then-owners, Cochran-Smith Broadcasting of Nashville, chose to move the studios, offices, and transmitter approximately one mile north of the entertainment center, to their present location on Red Foley Road.  (Cochran Smith's group of partners had leased the entire entertainment center from Lair in 1966, then exercised their option to buy it in 1968.  When they sold the facility back to Lair and his new partners, they kept ownership of WRVK, and moved it out of the Valley.).  WRVK is now a 1,200 watt station owned by Saylor Broadcasting, Inc. of Mt. Vernon, Kentucky.\n\nWRVK airs the Gatherin' on Saturdays at 6:25am. The Renfro Valley Entertainment Center currently lists WCYO/Irvine, Kentucky and WLXO/Stamping Ground, Kentucky as official radio stations, but neither station carries the Gatherin'. The show remains in production and in syndication.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nwww.renfrovalley.com: Official site of Renfro Valley Entertainment Center\nwww.renfrovalley.com: Audio of Gatherin' radio programs\nwww.wrvk1460.com: Official site of WRVK Radio Station\n\nRockcastle County, Kentucky\nAmerican country music radio programs", "machine_text": "Renfro Valley Gatherin' is a musical variety show that was started in 1939 by John Lair, a radio broadcaster and musician, in Renfro Valley, Kentucky.

A total of 1,502 S-2s were built from August 1940 to June 1950; 797 S-4s were built from June 1949 to August 1957. The S-4 was first produced in Canada, with ALCO production beginning in June 1949. \n\nThe S-2 and S-4 were designed as rail yard switchers, meant to replace older, less efficient, and more demanding steam switchers. They were a success, with many remaining in service today.\n\nThe locomotives' exterior was styled by ALCO engineer Ray Patten, who used curves in a mild application of Art Deco principles. \n\nThe S-2 and S-4 are distinguishable externally from the very similar S-1 and S-3 660 hp (492 kW) switchers in that they have a larger exhaust stack with an oblong base and a larger radiator shutter area on the nose sides. The S-1/S-3 radiator shutter area is taller than it is wide, while the S-2/S-4 radiator area is wider. The larger stack is due to turbocharging. The carbody and cab of late S-2s are nearly indistinguishable from those of S-4s. Hence, a truck swap can cause many to misidentify a unit.\n\nSurvivors\nA few S-2s and S-4s are still in service on short line railroads around the United States.

It is located just north of the Passamaquoddy Bay which is part of the Bay of Fundy, near the border with Maine, United States. The town of Chamcook, New Brunswick lies on the eastern bank of the lake and Chamcook Mountain is nearby. The lake has been notable within New England and Canada for its fishing.\n\nEtymology\nChamcook comes from the Passamaquoddy  word K'tchumcook which, according to William Francis Ganong, has many meanings but none are certain.\n\nGeography\nChamcook Lake is approximately  from Passamaquoddy Bay. The lake is connected by road to St. Stephen, New Brunswick. A Canadian Pacific Railway freight service station has been located at Chamcook Lake.\n\nThe lake is situated at  above sea level, and has a maximum depth of . The Chamcook River which feeds the Chamcook Lake rises from the cone shaped hill range of Mt. Chamcook. The Chamkcook harbour, a wet dock, lies is to the eastern side of the peninsular where development took place. It contains Odell Island in the southeast and Big Rock in the north. Despite its name, the Odell Island is larger than Big Rock. Approximately  to the north beyond Big Rock is a sister lake named Little Chamcook Lake. The Chamcook Lake watershed serves as a potable water supply for the Atlantic Salmon Federation, the St. Andrews Biological Station, the Champlain Industrial Park, and the town of St. Andrews.\n\nThe lake's red rock is feldspathic, of a brownish-red colour that weathers to brick-red, imperfectly syenitic, and showing some indications of an eruptive origin. A set of very fine petro-siliceous rocks, which are almost black, but have a perceptible purplish tinge are situated on the western shore.\n\nThe steep and solitary Chamcook Mountain overlooks the lake.  The mountain has a glacial rounded top scored with long scratches which indicate that a glacier from the northern highlands had grated its way across the mountain. The Chamcook Lake and the Chamcook mountain are both located in the Silurian belt of huge sandstones which has fossiliferous and volcanic formations in different sections.\n\nEcology\nAfter an advisory warning was issued in September 2010 for bloom of blue green algae, no detectable toxins were found in the town's drinking water supply, which comes from the lake, though officials continued to monitor the water supply.\n\nFlora and Fauna\n\nChamcook Lake contains populations of Vitrea and in the 1930s a new species of Holopedium water flea (family Holopediidae) was discovered in the area. Lymnaea is found mainly along the lake's margin, composed chiefly of Isoetes echinospora; Sagittaria montevidensis; Potamogeton gramineus; Potamogeton spirillus; and the aquatic form of Hypericum boreale. Ground Cedar is found on the lake's dry bank and Isoetes echinospora is frequent along the lake's south margin.\n\nThe mushroom Boletus luridus Schaef. vermiculosus Pk has been found nearby. Of the Halophytes, Sagittaria latifolia, Sagittaria cuneata, Alopecurus aequalis, Glyceria borealis, Eleocharis acicularis, Acorus calamus, and Juncus pelocarpus are noted along the lake margins. The fern vegetation found on the lake's shores and along the stream which flows out from the Chamcook Lake to the sea are Diphasiastrum complanatum, Diphasiastrum digitatum,  and Isoetes echinospora.\n\nIn 1886, 200,000 salmon and salmon trout fry (young trout) were deposited in the lake. Fish species reported from the lake included sockeye salmon, steelhead trout and brown trout. During certain times of the year, it is said to contain heavy populations of sebago salmon. Studies conducted into the methylmercury concentration of eels from Chamcook Lake in the early 1970s indicated elevated levels of mercury in the lake's ecosystem, although brook trout from the lake revealed only 0.03 ppm.\n\nSee also\nList of lakes of New Brunswick\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n http://www.muskiesnb.ca/hydrographic%20mapping/NB%20Lakes.pdf\n\nLakes of New Brunswick", "machine_text": "Chamcook Lake is a pristine lake located in St. Andrews, New Brunswick, Canada.

Chamcook Lake is approximately 5.5 kilometers in length and spans an area of approximately 400 hectares. It is situated in the heart of the lush forests, surrounded by rolling hills and rocky terrain. The lake is fed by several streams and tributaries, and its waters are primarily drained by Chamcook Stream that flows southward into the Bay of Fundy. The lake is renowned for its crystal-clear waters and rich aquatic life, with a diversity of fish species such as landlocked salmon, brook trout, and bass, making it an ideal destination for fishing enthusiasts. The lake is also a popular spot for swimming, with several beaches located along its shoreline offering breathtaking views of the surrounding landscapes. Aside from recreational activities, Chamcook Lake plays an essential role in the ecosystem, as it serves as a habitat for a wide variety of wildlife, ranging from birds, deer, and other small mammals. The surrounding forest also performs important ecological functions, such as water filtration and carbon sequestration. Chamcook Lake has a rich history, dating back to the early days of European settlement in the region. The lake and its surroundings were home to the indigenous inhabitants of the Passamaquoddy and Maliseet First Nations, who relied on the lake's resources for sustenance and cultural activities.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Winona Lake Historic District\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Winona Lake Historic District is located along the Eastern shore of Winona Lake in Kosciusko County, Indiana. Historically, it is perhaps best known as a major center within the evangelical Bible Conference Movement during the first half of the twentieth century, though these gatherings were just one part of the larger history of the town of Winona Lake, an area which has been a Chautauqua site, resort spot, and conference center. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places in Kosciusko County, Indiana, since 1993.\n\nChautauqua era origins \nIn 1888, J. F. Beyer purchased the area that surrounded the eastern side of what was then known as Eagle Lake. Beyer, along with his brothers, owned a wholesale dairy business in nearby Warsaw, Indiana, and were attracted to the 160-acre tract because of the many artesian springs that could provide a means of natural refrigeration.\n \nThe Beyer Brothers had additional plans for their property, however, and they founded Spring Fountain Park as a summer resort and Chautauqua site. The Park included such attractions as a race track, a modest roller coaster and cyclorama. A hotel was built, as well as an auditorium, which was used for programs and lectures. The first program included a keynote lecture from John Heyl Vincent, a co-founder of the original Chautauqua Institution in western New York.\n\nThe grounds changed ownership in 1894 when The Presbyterian Church of Indiana purchased the land, a transaction that was negotiated by Solomon C. Dickey. Dickey was then serving as the superintendent of Home Missions for the Indiana synod and would become an honored figure in Winona Lake. Dickey changed the name of the lake and established the Winona Assembly and Summer School in 1895. Although Chautauqua sites often included religious elements, Dickey was intent on bringing a stronger religious feel to the Winona programs and Bible conferences were begun immediately in 1896. \nSeveral notable persons held the position of president of the \"Assembly,\" including H. J. Heinz and John Studebaker. Well known evangelists including J. Wilbur Chapman and William Biederwolf served as heads of the Bible conferences. Many performers and lecturers included Winona Lake in their Chautauqua \"circuits,\" including Benjamin Harrison, William Jennings Bryan, Admiral Richard Byrd, Glenn Curtiss, Helen Keller, Will Rogers, James Whitcomb Riley, and Jane Addams among others. In 1911, the sensational evangelist Billy Sunday moved his family to Winona Lake, building an Arts and Crafts bungalow that has been preserved as the Billy Sunday Home Museum. Sunday's song leader, Homer Rodeheaver, soon relocated to Winona Lake as well. Numerous small summer schools were also established.\n\nBible conference hub \nDuring its Chautauqua height around 1910, crowds averaged 250,000 annually but by 1915, attendance was in decline. As the fuller Chautauqua-type programming declined, the Bible and prophecy conferences remained strong and became the hall-mark of Winona Lake. These gatherings also reflected a turn toward fundamentalism and Premillennial Dispensationalism, though Winona Lake remained a central hub for a wide variety of evangelical leaders and activities. Youth for Christ, for example, was founded in Winona Lake in 1944 and Billy Graham spoke in the Billy Sunday Tabernacle in 1949. Graham and other Youth for Christ leaders held an all-night prayer vigil in the Westminster Hotel shortly before Graham's Los Angeles crusade and this is remembered by Winona Lake locals as something that helped launch Graham's career. By the 1960s, the \"Assembly\" had had several rounds of financial pressures and even the Bible Conferences were dwindling. In 1968, the grounds were purchased by Grace College and Theological Seminary and the school also assumed the assembly's heavy debts.\n\nCommunity renaissance \nDuring the 1980s, as the older buildings and facilities continued to decline, the historic district became known for its dilapidated condition. The town experienced a renaissance in 2000, however, when local business leaders invested the heavy resources needed to create The Village at Winona and other recreational and local initiatives. The effort included the restoration of historic buildings, the creation of small shops along the canal, cultural events, formation of the Reneker Museum of Winona History (Now The Winona History Center) and the promotion of outdoor leisure and recreation. Although these efforts took place between 1998 and 2000, members of the Winona Historical Society had been raising awareness and taking small steps since at least 1990.\n\nRemaining historic buildings \n The Winona Hotel (originally called Eagle Lake Hotel)\n Westminster Hall (Formerly known as the Presbyterian Building, The Westminster Hotel and the International Friendship House)\n Mount Memorial (Originally called the Free Methodist Publishing House)\n Billy Sunday Home\n The Franconia (Home)\n The Administration Building\n The Beyer Home\n Killarney Castle (Solomon Dickey's home)\n The Railroad Power Station\n Church of the Good Shepherd\n Winona Lake Free Methodist Church\n Swiss Terrace Homes (The Geneva, Interlaken)\n\nSee also\nChinworth Bridge\nKosciusko County Jail\nWarsaw Courthouse Square Historic District\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n The Village at Winona\n The Winona History Center at Grace College\n\nHistoric districts in Kosciusko County, Indiana\nHistoric districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Indiana\nNational Register of Historic Places in Kosciusko County, Indiana\n1887 establishments in Indiana", "machine_text": "Winona Lake Historic District is a picturesque tourist attraction and residential district located in the town of Winona Lake, Kosciusko County, Indiana, United States. The district is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, added on November 4, 1982. The district is situated on the eastern shore of a lake and is considered a haven for water recreation. It was founded in the early 20th century as a retreat center for the former Indiana governor, James A. Mount, who transformed a swampy area into a recreational resort. The district was originally designed to cater to those seeking religious retreat and spiritual enrichment. The area is known for its unique historical buildings, architecture, and community lifestyle that reflects the early 20th-century Midwestern culture. It features over 20 different architectural styles of buildings of various sizes, from small cottages to grandiose mansions. The district also incorporates several local landmarks, such as the Winona Hotel, the Phelps Memorial Hospital, and the Winona Assembly Hall. The Winona Hotel, built in 1924, is an imposing, colonial revival structure that served as an exclusive vacation destination for the wealthy and elite. The Phelps Memorial Hospital, built-in 1915 in the classic revival style, originally served as a sanitarium for tuberculosis patients. Today it is an assisted living center and nursing home. The Winona Assembly Hall, built-in 1894, is a charming Swiss chalet-style building that now serves as the town hall. The district has a unique connection with the broader religious Christian community. The famed evangelist, Billy Sunday, lived and preached in Winona Lake for several years, and the popular, Christian author, Alisa Childers, grew up in the area. The Winona Lake Historic District has a rich and diverse history and has been maintained over the years in its original character.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Crips\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Crips is an alliance of street gangs which is based in the coastal regions of southern California. It was founded in Los Angeles, California, in 1969, mainly by Raymond Washington and Stanley Williams. Once a single alliance between two autonomous gangs, it is now a loosely-connected network of individual \"sets\", often engaged in open warfare with one another. Traditionally, since around 1973, its members have worn blue clothing.\n\nThe Crips are one of the largest and most violent associations of street gangs in the United States. With an estimated 30,000 to 35,000 members in 2008, the members have been involved in murders, robberies and drug dealing, among other crimes. They have a long and bitter rivalry with the Bloods.\n\nEtymology\n\nSome sources suggest that the original name for the alliance, \"Cribs\", was narrowed down from a list of many options and chosen unanimously from three final choices, over the Black Overlords and the Assassins. Cribs was chosen to reflect the young age of the majority of the gang members. The name evolved into \"Crips\" when gang members began carrying around canes to display their \"pimp\" status. People in the neighborhood then began calling them cripples, or \"Crips\" for short. In February 1972 the Los Angeles Times used the term. Another source suggests \"Crips\" may have evolved from \"Cripplers\", a 1970s street gang in Watts, of which Washington was a member. The name had no political, organizational, cryptic, or acronymic meaning, though some have suggested it stands for \"Common Revolution In Progress\", a backronym. According to the film Bastards of the Party, directed by a member of the Bloods, the name represented \"Community Revolutionary Interparty Service\" or \"Community Reform Interparty Service\".\n\nHistory \n\nGang activity in South Central Los Angeles has its roots in a variety of factors dating to the 1950s, including: post-World War II economic decline leading to joblessness and poverty; racial segregation of young African American men, who were excluded from organizations such as the Boy Scouts, leading to the formation of black \"street clubs\"; and the waning of black nationalist organizations such as the Black Panther Party and the Black Power Movement.\n\nStanley Tookie Williams met Raymond Lee Washington in 1969, and the two decided to unite their local gang members from the west and east sides of South Central Los Angeles in order to battle neighboring street gangs. Most of the members were 17 years old. Williams however appears to discount the sometimes-cited founding date of 1969 in his memoir, Blue Rage, Black Redemption. \n\nIn his memoir, Williams also refuted claims that the group was a spin-off of the Black Panther Party or formed for a community agenda, writing that it \"depicted a fighting alliance against street gangs\u2014nothing more, nothing less.\" Washington, who attended Fremont High School, was the leader of the East Side Crips, and Williams, who attended Washington High School, led the West Side Crips.\n\nWilliams recalled that a blue bandana was first worn by Crips founding member Buddha, as a part of his color-coordinated clothing of blue Levis, a blue shirt, and dark blue suspenders. A blue bandana was worn in tribute to Buddha after he was shot and killed on February 23, 1973. The color then became associated with Crips.\n\nBy 1978, there were 45 Crip gangs, called sets, in Los Angeles. They were heavily involved in the production of PCP, marijuana and amphetamines. On March 11, 1979, Williams, a member of the Westside Crips, was arrested for four murders and on August 9, 1979, Washington was gunned down. Washington had been against Crip infighting and after his death several Crip sets started fighting against each other. The Crips' leadership was dismantled, prompting a deadly gang war between the Rollin' 60 Neighborhood Crips and Eight Tray Gangster Crips that led nearby Crip sets to choose sides and align themselves with either the Neighborhood Crips or the Gangster Crips, waging large-scale war in South Central and other cities. The East Coast Crips (from East Los Angeles) and the Hoover Crips directly severed their alliance after Washington's death. By 1980, the Crips were in turmoil, warring with the Bloods and against each other. The gang's growth and influence increased significantly in the early 1980s when crack cocaine hit the streets and Crip sets began distributing the drug. Large profits induced many Crips to establish new markets in other cities and states. As a result, Crips membership grew steadily and the street gang was one of the nation's largest by the late 1980s. In 1999, there were at least 600 Crip sets with more than 30,000 members transporting drugs in the United States.\n\nMembership\nAs of 2015, the Crips gang consists of between approximately 30,000 and 35,000 members and 800 sets, active in 221 cities and 41 U.S. states. The states with the highest estimated number of Crip sets are California, Texas, Oklahoma, and Missouri. Members typically consist of young African American men, but can be white, Hispanic, Asian, and Pacific Islander. Crip sets are not exclusive to the United States, having a presence in the Canadian cities of Montreal and Toronto.\n\nIn 1992 the LAPD estimated 15,742 Crips in 108 sets; other source estimates were 30,000 to 35,000 in 600 sets in California.\n\nCrips have served in the United States armed forces and on military bases in the United States and abroad.\n\nPractices\n\nLanguage\nSome practices of Crip gang life include graffiti and substitutions and deletions of particular letters of the alphabet. The letter \"b\" in the word \"blood\" is \"disrespected\" among certain Crip sets and written with a cross inside it because of its association with the enemy. The letters \"CK\", which are interpreted to stand for \"Crip killer\", are avoided and replaced by \"cc\". For example, the words \"kick back\" are written \"kicc bacc\", and block is written as \"blocc\". Many other words and letters are also altered due to symbolic associations. Crips traditionally refer to each other as \"Cuz\" or \"Cuzz\", which itself is sometimes used as a moniker for a Crip. \"Crab\" is the most disrespectful epithet to call a Crip, and can warrant fatal retaliation. Crips in prison modules in the 1970s and 1980s sometimes spoke Swahili to maintain privacy from guards and rival gangs.\n\nInitiation (\"Jumping in\")\n\nAlthough getting \"jumped into the gang\" is often commonly thought of as a typical initiation ritual performed on newcomers, some former Crip members such as rapper Brotha Lynch Hung, who joined the 24 Street Crips in Sacramento, California during the 1980s has pointed out that the tradition of getting jumped (beaten) into the gang was \"more of a 1970s (era) practice\" rather than a modern or continuing one.\n\nCriminal rackets and street-activities\n\nAs with most criminal street gangs they have traditionally benefited monetarily from a select set of illicit activities such as illegal gambling, drug-dealing, prostitution, burglary, theft and extortion. Along with profitable rackets such as these, they have also been known to participate in vandalism and property crime, often for gang-pride reasons or just enjoyment. This can include public graffiti (tagging) and \"joyriding\" in stolen vehicles.\n\nTheir current primary illicit source of income is presumably in street-level drug distribution, however many Crip members may also make notable amounts of illegal funds from the black market sale of illicit firearms. Historically, the gang\u2019s size and power was largely augmented by the profits from the street sale of crack cocaine throughout the 1980s showing that PCP, amphetamines and other drugs were not as lucrative for them and thus didn\u2019t have as direct of an effect on the group\u2019s increase in influence.  Therefore the gang\u2019s initial phase of growth and popularity can, in some way, be directly traced back to the explosion crack cocaine in the United States during the 1980s.\n\nCrip-on-Crip rivalries \n\nThe Crips became popular throughout southern Los Angeles as more youth gangs joined; at one point they outnumbered non-Crip gangs by 3 to 1, sparking disputes with non-Crip gangs, including the L.A. Brims, Athens Park Boys, the Bishops, The Drill Company, and the Denver Lanes. By 1971 the gang's notoriety had spread across Los Angeles.\n\nBy 1971, a gang on Piru Street in Compton, California, known as the Piru Street Boys, formed and associated itself with the Crips as a set. After two years of peace, a feud began between the Pirus and the other Crip sets. It later turned violent as gang warfare ensued between former allies. This battle continued and by 1973, the Pirus wanted to end the violence and called a meeting with other gangs targeted by the Crips. After a long discussion, the Pirus broke all connections to the Crips and started an organization that would later be called the Bloods, a street gang infamous for its rivalry with the Crips.\n\nSince then, other conflicts and feuds were started between many of the remaining Crip sets. It is a common misconception that Crip sets feud only with Bloods. In reality, they also fight each other\u2014for example, the Rolling 60s Neighborhood Crips and 83 Gangster Crips have been rivals since 1979. In Watts, the Grape Street Crips and the PJ Watts Crips have feuded so much that the PJ Watts Crips even teamed up with a local Blood set, the Bounty Hunter Bloods, to fight the Grape Street Crips. In the mid-1990s, the Hoover Crips rivalries and wars with other Crip sets caused them to become independent and drop the Crip name, calling themselves the Hoover Criminals.\n\nAlliances and rivalries\n\nRivalry with Bloods \nThe Bloods are the Crips' main stereotypical rival. The Bloods initially formed to provide members protection from the Crips. The rivalry started in the 1960s when Washington and other Crip members attacked Sylvester Scott and Benson Owens, two students at Centennial High School. After the incident, Scott formed the Pirus, while Owens established the West Piru gang. In late 1972, several gangs that felt victimized by the Crips due to their escalating attacks joined the Pirus to create a new federation of non-Crip gangs that later became known as Bloods. Between 1972 and 1979, the rivalry between the Crips and Bloods grew, accounting for a majority of the gang-related murders in southern Los Angeles. Members of the Bloods and Crips occasionally fight each other and, as of 2010, are responsible for a significant portion of gang-related murders in Los Angeles.\n\nAlliance with Folk Nation \nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, as many Crip gang members were being sent to various prisons across the country, an alliance was formed between the Crips and the Folk Nation in Midwest and Southern U.S. prisons. This alliance was established to protect gang members incarcerated in state and federal prison. It is strongest within the prisons, and less effective outside. The alliance between the Crips and Folks is known as \"8-ball\". A broken 8-ball indicates a disagreement or \"beef\" between Folks and Crips.\n\nSee also \nAfrican-American organized crime\nCrip Walk\nCrime in Los Angeles\nGangs in Los Angeles\nCrips and Bloods: Made in America\n\nReferences\n\nFootnotes\n\nGeneral \n\n Leon Bing (1991).

The group was formed in 1969 by Raymond Washington and Stanley Williams, two teenagers from South Central Los Angeles. The Crips gained notoriety during the 1970s and 1980s thanks to their involvement in drug trafficking, robbery, and violence, which resulted in their members being incarcerated or killed. The Crips originally started as a loose association of African American youth who banded together for protection against the violence of larger gangs such as the Bloods. However, as the group grew in size and power, they began engaging in more serious criminal activities, including drug trafficking, which quickly became their primary source of income. In the early years, the Crips were known for their distinctive blue clothing and use of certain hand signs and graffiti to identify themselves. They also developed a strict set of rules and codes of conduct that governed the behavior of their members, including a strict hierarchy and strict punishments for violating the group's rules. The Crips became embroiled in a bitter rivalry with the Bloods, another major African American street gang, throughout the 1980s and 1990s. This led to a wave of violent clashes between the two groups, with innocent bystanders frequently caught in the crossfire. Over the years, law enforcement agencies have made numerous attempts to crackdown on the Crips and other street gangs, often resulting in the arrest and imprisonment of dozens or even hundreds of members. Despite these efforts, however, the Crips and other gangs continue to operate in many parts of Los Angeles and other cities throughout the United States.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 3434023}

Produced by group member Tataee and mixed by longtime B.U.G. Mafia collaborator Cristi Dobric\u0103, it was released for digital download through the group's official website on June 29, 2011.\n\nMusically, \"F\u0103r\u0103 Cuvinte\" is predominantly a rap song, backed by a dark, minimalist, drum-heavy production with extra piano keys featured in the introduction and the chorus. However, it also incorporates elements of other genres, particularly pop music with the Loredana Groza-sung chorus and arabic music, using various ethnic instruments in its instrumental production. Lyrically, the song is largely about the social situation in modern-day Romania and about how the group's members feel frustrated when dealing with day-to-day hardship and violence.\n\nDue to the song's instrumental being leaked onto the Internet several months in advance to its release, it was a significant commercial success on its official release, particularly in the Romania, where it quickly rose to local music charts just days after being released.\n\nBackground \n\nThe official version premiered through B.U.G.

The video also premiered on June 29, 2011.\n\nThe video begins with an introduction of actors Drago\u015f Bucur and Mirela Opri\u015for, who portray an average Romanian family, driving along on a country road while their infant child starts crying in the back of the car. As they start talking and try to comfort their child, they lose control of the car, go on the wrong lane and, as they try to avoid a collision with a truck, they roll over and crash the car. The video then cuts to the crash site with the two parents struggling to get out of the vehicle. As they desperately try to escape and call an emergency service, people start approaching the car, apparently to help them, but as they come closer to the car, they start robbing the two of all their possessions. The video alternates with shots of the group's members reciting their verses and the two characters struggling in agony as witnesses take part in a bizarre bystander effect, not only avoiding to help the two, but taking every valuable object they can find in the car in a scene reminiscent of the 2005 Andrew Niccol drama, Lord of War, meant to portray the absurde implications that poverty casts upon society. The finale reveals the ending of a skillfully crafted dream sequence, as Mirela Opri\u015for's character suddenly wakes up and comes to realize that she was having a nightmare in the car. The couple is listening to B.U.G. Mafia's previous collaboration with Loredana Groza, a 1998 single called \"Lumea e a mea\" (The World Is Mine) in the car.\n\nAccording to Tataee, the video was shot in two locations, one a Bucharest IMGB warehouse and the other an abandoned monastery in Chiajna.\n\nTrack listing \n Digital single\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n B.U.G Mafia official download page.\n\n2011 singles\nB.U.G.

This genus comprises about 20 species of flowering plants that are commonly known as colic-root or unicorn-root due to their traditional medicinal uses. Aletris plants are native to temperate and tropical regions of the Americas, from the southeastern United States to Brazil. They typically grow in well-draining soils, often in grasslands or pine forests. The plant's leaves form a basal rosette, while its solitary flowers are borne on erect stalks. The flowers are usually yellow, but species such as Aletris farinosa or white colic-root have white flowers. The genus Aletris has a long history of medicinal use by indigenous peoples and later by European settlers in North America. The Cherokee used the root to treat colic pain in infants, hence the name colic-root. European Americans used unicorn-root, as it was also called, as a tonic to treat various disorders, including menstrual cramps, dysentery, and malaria. Scientific studies have revealed that Aletris plants contain a range of biologically active compounds, including saponins and alkaloids. These compounds have been found to have anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antispasmodic properties. This has led to modern medicinal uses such as the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome and menstrual pain. In addition to its medicinal properties, Aletris plants also have significant cultural value to some indigenous peoples. Cherokee legend holds that the plant was a gift from the Great Spirit, and that its root was used to calm the colic in a crying infant who was actually a reincarnation of a beloved chief. Overall, Aletris is a genus of plants with a rich history of traditional medicinal use and cultural significance that continues to be studied and appreciated today.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 7408379}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Chaim Gross\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Chaim Gross (March 17, 1902 \u2013 May 5, 1991) was an American sculptor and educator.\n\nChildhood\nGross was born to a Jewish family in Austrian Galicia, in the village of Wolowa (now known as Mezhgorye, Ukraine), in the Carpathian Mountains. In 1911, his family moved to Kolomyia (which was annexed into the Ukrainian SSR in 1939 and became part of newly independent Ukraine in 1991). During World War I, Russian forces invaded Austria-Hungary; amidst the turmoil, the Grosses fled Kolomyia. They returned when Austria retook the town in 1915, refugees of the war. When World War I ended, Gross and brother Avrom-Leib went to Budapest to join their older siblings Sarah and Pinkas.  Gross applied to and was accepted by the art academy in Budapest and studied under the painter B\u00e9la Uitz, though within a year a new regime under Mikl\u00f3s Horthy took over and attempted to expel all Jews and foreigners from the country.  After being deported from Hungary, Gross began art studies at the Kunstgewerbeschule in Vienna, Austria shortly before immigrating to the United States in 1921.\n\nEmigration from Austria to U.S.\nGross' brother Naftoli had arrived in New York City in 1914.  He sent money to his brothers Chaim and Avrom-Lieb, who traveled from Vienna to Le Havre, France, where they took a boat to New York City in March 1921.\n\nEarly Career 1921-1933\nGross's studies continued in the United States at the Beaux-Arts Institute of Design, where he studied with Elie Nadelman and others, and at the Art Students League of New York, with Robert Laurent.  He also attended the Educational Alliance Art School, studying under Abbo Ostrowsky, at the same time as Moses Soyer, Raphael Soyer, Adolph Gottlieb, and Peter Blume.\n\nIn 1926, Gross began teaching at The Educational Alliance, and continued teaching there for the next 50 years.  Louise Nevelson was among his students at the Alliance (in 1934), during the time she was transitioning from painting to sculpture.\n\nGross began exhibiting sculpture in group shows of students at the Educational Alliance, and then at the Jewish Art Center in the Bronx. In the late 1920s and early 1930s he exhibited at the Salons of America exhibitions at the Anderson Galleries and, beginning in 1928, at the Whitney Studio Club (the precursor to the Whitney Museum of American Art).\n\nIn 1929, Gross experimented with printmaking, and created an important group of 15 linocuts and lithographs of landscapes, New York City streets and parks, women in interiors, the circus, and vaudeville. The entire suite is now in the collection of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Gross returned to the medium of printmaking in the 1960s, and produced approximately 200 works in the medium over the next two decades.\n\nIn March 1932, Gross had his first solo exhibition at Gallery 144 in New York City.  For a short time they represented Gross, as well as his friends Milton Avery, Moses Soyer, Ahron Ben-Shmuel and others.\n\nGross was primarily a practitioner of the direct carving method, with the majority of his work being carved from wood. Other direct carvers in early 20th-century American art include William Zorach, Jose de Creeft, and Robert Laurent. Works by Chaim Gross can be found in major museums and private collections throughout the United States, with substantial holdings (27 sculptures) at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden. A key work from this era, now at the Smithsonian American Art Museum, is the 1932 birds-eye maple Acrobatic Performers,  which is also only one and one quarter inch thick. His work was also part of the sculpture event in the art competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics.\n\nMaturity 1933-1957\nIn 1933 Gross joined the government's PWAP (Public Works of Art Project), which transitioned into the WPA (Works Progress Administration), which Gross worked for later in the 1930s.  Under these programs Gross taught and demonstrated art, made sculptures that were placed in schools and public colleges, made work for Federal buildings including the Federal Trade Commission Building, and for the France Overseas and Finnish Buildings at the 1939 New York World's Fair. Gross was also recognized during these years with a silver medal at the Exposition universelle de 1937 in Paris, and in 1942, with a purchase prize at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's \"Artists for Victory\" exhibition for his wood sculpture of famed circus performer Lillian Leitzel.\n\nIn 1938 filmmaker and historian Lewis Jacobs made a 30-minute feature of Gross carving, called Tree Trunk to Head, showing Gross at work in his East Village studio on a portrait of his wife Renee, who models in the film.\n\nIn 1949 Gross sketched Chaim Weizmann, President of Israel, at several functions in New York City where Weizmann was speaking.  Gross began a portrait in clay and then traveled to Israel in the summer of that year hoping to be able to meet Weizmann and have him sit for a portrait.  Weizmann was too ill, but Gross completed the bust in bronze later that year.  Gross returned to Israel for three months in 1951 (the second of many trips there in the postwar years) to paint a series of 40 watercolors of life in various cities. This series was exhibited at the Jewish Museum (Manhattan) in 1953.  \n \nChaim Gross, Sculptor by Josef Vincent Lombardo, the first major book on Gross, came out in 1949. It included a catalogue raisonne of his sculpture.\n\nIn the 1950s Gross began to make more bronze sculptures alongside his wood and stone pieces, and in 1957 and 1959 he traveled to Rome to work with famed bronze foundries including the Nicci foundry.  At the end of the decade Gross was working primarily in bronze, which allowed him to create open forms, large-scale works and of course, multiple casts. Gross's large-scale bronze The Family, donated to New York City in 1991 in honor of Mayor Ed Koch, and installed at the Bleecker Street Park at 11th street, is now a fixture of Greenwich Village.\n\nLater Career 1957-1991\n\nIn 1957, Gross published The Techniques of Wood Sculpture, an influential how-to book with photographs of him at work by famed photographer Eliot Elisofon. In 1959, a survey of Gross's sculpture in wood, stone, and bronze was featured in the exhibit Four American Expressionists curated by Lloyd Goodrich at the Whitney Museum of American Art, with work by Abraham Rattner, Doris Caesar, and Karl Knaths. In 1963, Gross and his family moved from their longtime residence at 30 W. 105th Street to Greenwich Village, following the purchase of a four-story historic townhouse and studio at 526 LaGuardia Place. The townhouse is now the Renee and Chaim Gross Foundation, winner of a 2015 Village Award from the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation, and open to the public.\n\nIn 1974, the Smithsonian American Art Museum held the exhibition, Chaim Gross: Sculpture and Drawings, organized by Janet A. Flint, Smithsonian Curator of Prints and Drawings. In 1976, a selection from Gross's important collection of historic African sculpture, formed since the late 1930s, was exhibited at the Worcester Art Museum in the show The Sculptor's Eye: The African Art Collection of Mr. and Mrs. Chaim Gross.\n\nIn 1977, Gross had three retrospective exhibitions: at the Lowe Art Museum at the University of Miami, followed by the Montclair Art Museum; and the Jewish Museum (Manhattan). The Jewish Museum's exhibition catalog featured an important essay on Gross by art historian and modern American sculpture specialist Roberta K. Tarbell, Professor Emeritus at Rutgers University.\n\nGross received multiple honorary doctorates in the 1970s and 80s: from Franklin and Marshall College (1970); Yeshiva University (1978); Adelphi University (1980); Hebrew Union College (1984); and Brooklyn College (1986). In 1979 Gross was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full Academician in 1981. In 1984, he was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Letters, with Jacob Lawrence and Lukas Foss. Gross died at Beth Israel Hospital in May 1991 and was buried at Mount Lebanon Cemetery in Queens, New York. In the fall of 1991, Allen Ginsberg gave an important tribute to Gross at the American Academy of Arts and Letters, which is published in their Proceedings. In 1994, Forum Gallery, which now represents the Chaim Gross estate, held a memorial exhibition featuring a sixty-year survey of Gross's work.\n\nTeaching\nGross was a professor of printmaking and sculpture at both the Educational Alliance and the New School for Social Research in New York City, as well as at the Brooklyn Museum Art School, the MoMA art school, the Art Student's League and the New Art School (which Gross ran briefly with Alexander Dobkin, Raphael Soyer and Moses Soyer).\n\nGross was a member of the New York Artists Equity Association and the Federation of Modern Painters and Sculptors. He was a founder and served as the first president of the Sculptors Guild.\n\nPersonal life\nIn 1932 Gross married Renee Nechin (d. 2005), and they had two children, Yehuda and Mimi.  Mimi Gross is a New York-based artist. She was married to the artist Red Grooms from 1963-1976.\n\nGallery\n\nNotes\n\nSee also\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20140620172948/http://americanart.si.edu/exhibitions/online/gross/index.html\n\nReferences\n Brumm\u00e9, C.

He was born in Austria-Hungary (now Ukraine) and immigrated to the United States in 1921. He is recognized as one of the most influential modernist sculptors of the 20th century. Gross began his artistic career as a painter, but after discovering the work of sculptor Constantin Brancusi, he devoted himself to sculpture. He attended the Beaux-Arts Institute of Design and the Educational Alliance Art School in New York City and studied under notable artists such as Elie Nadelman and Robert Laurent. Gross's sculptures range from small carvings to large public monuments, and are known for their dynamic forms and expressive textures. He primarily worked with wood, although he also used bronze, stone, and other materials. Many of his sculptures depict human subjects, often in motion or engaged in everyday activities. Throughout his career, Gross was also dedicated to art education. He taught at the Educational Alliance and the New School for Social Research, among other institutions, and established the Renee and Chaim Gross Foundation to support emerging artists. He also authored several books, including \"Sculpture: The Adventure of Modern Sculpture in the Twentieth Century.\" Gross's work has been exhibited nationally and internationally and is held in the collections of major institutions including the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington D.C., and the Tel Aviv Museum of Art in Israel.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"List of invasive species in the Everglades\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Invasive species in the Everglades are exotic plants and animals that are not native to the area and have aggressively adapted to conditions in wilderness areas in southern Florida. The Everglades are a massive watershed in the southern portion of the U.S. state of Florida that drains overflow from the vast shallow Lake Okeechobee that is in turn fed by the Kissimmee River. The overflow forms a very shallow river about  wide and  long that travels about half a mile per day. The network of ecosystems created by the Everglades are surrounded by urban areas to the east in the South Florida metropolitan area, to the west by Naples and Fort Myers, and to the south by Florida Bay, a marine environment that receives fresh water from and is maintained by the Everglades. As it is surrounded on three sides and close to a major transportation and shipping center, it is particularly vulnerable to the importation of exotic species.\n\nIn the 20th century, Florida experienced a population surge unparalleled in the U.S., accompanied by rapid urban expansion made possible by draining portions of the Everglades. Flood control became a priority and the Central & South Florida Flood Control Project, from 1947 to 1971, constructed over  of canals and flood control structures in South Florida. The widespread building created new habitats and disturbed established plant and animal communities. Many of the new residents or tourists in Florida were responsible for introducing plant species to the area by accident, or deliberately to improve landscaping.  Many animals have been introduced similarly, and have either escaped or been released to proliferate on their own. Several terms are used to identify non-native species: exotic, invader, immigrant, colonist, introduced, nonindigenous, and naturalized. \"Naturalized\" usually refers to species that have adapted to a region over a long period of time, while \"invasive\" refers to particularly destructive or aggressive species.\n\nApproximately 26 percent of all fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals in South Florida are exotic\u2014more than in any other part of the United States\u2014and the region hosts one of the highest numbers of exotic plant species in the world. Many of the biological controls like weather, disease, and consumers that naturally limit plants in their native environments do not exist in the Everglades, causing many to grow larger and multiply far beyond their average numbers in their native habitats. Similarly, animals often do not find the predators or natural barriers to reproduction in the Everglades as they do where they originated, thus they often reproduce more quickly and efficiently. Concerns over the quality of the Everglades were raised in the beginning of the 20th century, and by  2000 a federally funded initiative was enacted that gave Everglades restoration the distinction of being the largest planned environmental rehabilitation in history. Exotic species control falls under the management of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which has been compiling and disseminating information about invasive species since 1994. Control of invasive species costs $500\u00a0million a year, but  of land in South Florida remains infested.\n\nPlant species \nAs the fields of ecology and environmental studies develop, exotic species attract more attention and their effects become more apparent. Mid-20th century biology texts about invading species reflected more complacency than alarm, as contemporary wisdom about them assumed the host environment would be largely immune. Everglades biologist Thomas Lodge writes that in the 1960s, evidence of non-native plant and animal life in South Florida was present but not particularly \"worthy of notice.\" Over the past decades, however, the number of exotic species and their spread has increased dramatically.\n\nThe Everglades hosts 1,301 species of native flora that are tropical or subtropical in nature, which arrived on the Florida peninsula about 5,000 years ago. Winds, water, and birds carried most of the tropical flora. The subtropical species spread from more northern locations. As of 2010 1,392 additional non-native plant species have been identified and established themselves in South Florida. A variety of avenues are available for species to be brought by humans deliberately or by accident: agricultural experiments, in shipping containers, or attached to vehicles. South Florida is a transportation hub for shipping and traffic between the U.S. and the Caribbean and Central and South America. In 1990, 333\u00a0million plants were brought into Miami International Airport. Both the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agriculture Sciences (IFAS) experiment with plants in laboratories throughout Florida.\n\nState, local, and federal government agencies spend millions of dollars to rid South Florida of invasive species and prevent more from entering the region. Plants that are imported to Florida are subject to classification as \"Restricted\" or \"Prohibited\", but a new designation is being considered \"Not Authorized Pending Plant Risk Analysis\", to allow scientists to assess what damage exotic plants may cause to the South Florida environment. A nonprofit organization named The Florida Exotic Pest Plant Council lists exotic species as belonging in Category I: \"altering native plant communities by displacing native species, changing community structures or ecological functions, or hybridizing with natives\"; and Category II: \"increased in abundance or frequency but have not yet altered Florida plant communities to the extent shown by Category I\". More than 100 species have been placed in Category I, but a few have been singled out for the potential to cause the most destruction based on how rapidly they reproduce, their displacement of native flora by crowding, shading, or fire, excellent adaptations to conditions in the Everglades, and the potential to spread (or evidence that they have spread) into remote areas of the Everglades.\n\nAnimal species \n\nAlthough the general effects of invasive animals is not as profound as plants, they are more noticeable in many instances and a constant reminder of the many exotic species in the region. A wildlife biologist and several construction workers near Homestead Air Force Base witnessed a scene where several iguanas sunning themselves in a canal were attacked by a spectacled caiman, to the surprise of all.\n\nAbout 12,500 species of insects are native to Florida, most of which naturally flew into the region from the Caribbean or Southeastern United States. An additional 1,000 have been identified as exotic. Insects create about $1\u00a0billion of damage to structures and agriculture in Florida each year. The tide of arriving insects is nearly impossible to control with the volume of goods and shipments coming into South Florida. Imported citrus is a major avenue for damaging insects. Twenty-one species have been imported and released to act as biological control agents: to impede the growth of invasive plants or counter the effects of other insects. Others, such as the Madagascan hissing cockroach (Gromphadorhina portentosa) and European cricket (Acheta domesticus) are sold as pets or fishing bait, and are then released into backyards. Similarly, aquatic invertebrates such as mussels, clams, snails, and melania find their ways into local waters from the bottoms of ships or in bilge holds. The aquarium trade also supplies enthusiasts with exotic species which are dumped or escape into waterways.\n\nExcluding insects and other arthropods, 192 exotic animal species have established themselves in Florida as of 2009. More than 50 species of fish have been introduced. Early recorded species were the pike killifish (Belonesox belizanus) and oscar (Astronotus ocellatus). The extensive network of canals throughout South Florida allows many species to disperse more readily than they would under natural conditions as many regions in the Everglades go dry each year or experience extended drought periods. The overall impact of exotic fishes on the native populations and habitats is largely unknown.\n\nThe Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) initiated a task force to concentrate on identifying the most invasive animals. The agency created a list of \"Reptiles of Concern\" for the Burmese python, African rock python (Python sebae), amethystine python (Simalia amethystinus), reticulated python (Malayopython reticulatus), green anaconda (Eunectes murinus), and Nile monitor. Florida also began requiring owners to pay a permit fee of $100 a year and place microchips on the animals. These predators are included on the list for their formidable size and aggressive natures; animals that were in the Everglades before the list was created, however, are breeding in the wild.  Burmese Pythons have become of particular concern as they are starting to adapt to new environment, they easily hide, and in recent years, the population of other species is declining, particularly in the Everglades. To combat the number of exotic snakes in the U.S., and specifically in South Florida, the U.S. Department of the Interior added four species of snakes\u2014the Burmese python, both subspecies of the African rock python (northern and southern), and the yellow anaconda (Eunectes notaeus)\u2014to Lacey Act provisions, making their import into the U.S. illegal, in 2012. \n\nExotic birds do not attract the same amount of attention. They too have been brought to Florida as part of the pet trade and escape, get released by dealers attempting to avoid quarantine restrictions, or escape from damaged cages and artificial habitats during tropical storms. Typically, however, most nonindigenous birds live closer to populated areas; some populations of birds establish themselves but decline for unapparent reasons.\n\nMore than 50 species of exotic mammals have been recorded in South Florida, at least 19 of which are self-sustaining. Colonies of feral mammals are established in or around the Everglades, including dogs, pigs, and cats. Wild animals native to other parts of the U.S. have also been established, including nine-banded armadillos (Dasypus novemcinctus), coyotes (Canis latrans), and jaguarundi (Herpailurus yaguarondi).\n\nFlorida has enacted laws to prohibit the release of exotic animals into the wild. To dissuade people from dumping animals, local authorities have begun holding \"Nonnative Amnesty Days\" in several Florida locations where pet owners who are no longer willing or able to take care of non-traditional pets such as snakes, lizards, amphibians, birds, and mammals\u2014excluding dogs, cats, and ferrets\u2014can deposit animals without being prosecuted for illegal dumping of exotic species. The FWC has furthermore allowed hunters permits to capture Reptiles of Concern in a specific hunting season in wildlife management areas, euthanize the animals immediately and sell the meat and hides.\n\nInvertebrates\n\nFish\n\nReptiles\n\nBirds\n\nMammals\n\nSee also\nBurmese pythons in Florida\nInvasive species in the United States\nList of invasive marine fish in Florida\nList of invasive plant species in Florida\nList of invasive species in Florida\n\nFootnotes\n\nReferences\n Ferriter, Amy; Serbesoff-King, Kristina; Bodle, Mike; Goodyear, Carole; Doren, Bob; Langeland, Ken (2004).

The following is a list of invasive species that have been introduced to the Everglades: 1. Burmese Python - The Burmese python is a large constrictor snake native to Southeast Asia. These snakes have become a major problem in the Everglades since they were first introduced by exotic pet owners. They are known to prey on native wildlife, including deer, raccoons, and even alligators. 2. Brazilian Pepper - Brazilian pepper is a shrub that is native to South America, but it has been introduced to many parts of the world, including the Everglades. Brazilian pepper can grow to be 30 feet high and form dense thickets that crowd out native plants. 3. Australian Pine - Australian pine is a tree that is native to Australia. It was introduced to Florida in the early 1900s for use as a windbreak and for erosion control. Australian pine is an invasive species in the Everglades because it competes with native trees and shrubs for resources. 4. Old World Climbing Fern - The Old World climbing fern is a vine that is native to Africa and Asia. It was introduced to Florida in the 1930s as an ornamental plant. The fern can grow to be 100 feet long and can climb over and smother native vegetation. 5. Melaleuca - Melaleuca is a tree that is native to Australia. It was introduced to Florida in the early 1900s to drain marshy land. Melaleuca has become an invasive species in the Everglades because it can grow quickly and form dense stands that displace native vegetation. 6. Water Hyacinth - Water hyacinth is a floating plant that is native to South America. It was introduced to Florida in the 1880s as an ornamental plant. Water hyacinth is an invasive species in the Everglades because it can spread rapidly and form dense mats that block sunlight and oxygen from reaching the water. These invasive species are just a few of the many that threaten the health and diversity of the Everglades. Efforts are underway to control and eliminate invasive species, but it remains a challenging and ongoing problem in this important ecosystem.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 26093341}

In 1894, he earned a Bachelor of Arts in Natural Science at the University of Manitoba. Following graduation, he returned to the north where he and his brother caught gold rush fever and set out to stake a claim in Yukon. It was at this time that he developed an interest in geology and exploration.\n\nCareer with the public service of Canada\n\nCamsell had a long and outstanding career with the Public Service of Canada commencing in 1904.\n\nIn 1920, he was appointed Deputy Minister of Mines and, in 1936, Deputy Minister of Mines and Resources.\n\nHe retired from the Public Service of Canada in 1946 at the age of 70.\n\nOther contributions and recognition\n\nFrom 1930 to 1931 Camsell was President of the Royal Society of Canada.

He was also a philanthropist, serving on the board of numerous charitable organizations and advocating for Indigenous rights. Born in Ontario, Canada, Camsell graduated from the University of Toronto's medical school in 1901 and later specialized in tuberculosis and mental health. In 1908, he was appointed as a medical officer for the Hudson's Bay Company, which led him to explore the Canadian North and study the health of First Nations communities in the region. Camsell's contributions to the exploration of the Canadian North were significant. He led several expeditions to map the Mackenzie River basin and co-authored the first comprehensive map of the region in 1924. He also played a key role in the discovery of the Colville Lake zinc deposit in the Northwest Territories, which helped to spur economic development in the area. In addition to his work as an explorer, Camsell was a philanthropist and advocate for social justice. He served on the boards of organizations such as the Canadian Red Cross and the Canadian National Institute for the Blind, and he was a strong supporter of Indigenous rights. He worked closely with Indigenous communities in the North and often used his position to advocate for their needs and interests. Camsell's legacy is felt in numerous ways. He is remembered as an important figure in the exploration of the Canadian North, and his maps helped to open up the region to economic development. His advocacy work for Indigenous rights also helped to raise awareness of the challenges facing Indigenous communities in Canada. Today, the Camsell Hospital in Edmonton, Alberta, is named in his honor and stands as a testament to his contributions to medicine and public health.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 7576564}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"I Can Dream About You\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "\"I Can Dream About You\" is a song performed by American singer Dan Hartman on the soundtrack album of the film Streets of Fire. Released in 1984 as a single from the soundtrack, and included on Hartman's album I Can Dream About You, it reached number 6 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nBackground\nThe song first appeared in Streets of Fire, where it was performed by the fictional group The Sorels. The real voice behind the version used in the film was Winston Ford, but Hartman's version was the one used on the soundtrack album and released as a single. In a Songfacts interview with the film's musical director, Kenny Vance, he recalled the following:\"The same guy that sings lead on that and \"Countdown to Love,\" a song that I wrote for the film, was a guy working at a Radio Shack (Winston Ford), and I think when you look at the film and The Sorels are singing it live in the movie, that was the version that was supposed to come out, and I recorded that version. But then when Dan Hartman heard it, I don't know what happened next, but I know that he took that guy's voice off and he put his own on, and he had a hit with it. Hollywood is a very slippery place.\"\n\nOriginally, producer Jimmy Iovine had asked Hartman to write a song for a film he was working on. Hartman was told that the song was going to be sung by four Black guys in a concert situation within the film, and Hartman ended up thinking about a demo he made of \"I Can Dream About You.\" As described by Tuber (1985), Hartman went through some \u201clegal maneuvering to get the benefit of his breakthrough\u201d. The use of the song in the film being performed by actors did not feature Hartman on vocals but rather Ford. After some negotiating to enforce the original contract, Hartman insisted he sing the song on the soundtrack, and that his version be released if a single were to be issued from the soundtrack album. Additionally, any music video had to feature his own voice using the song. These clauses helped Hartman become an \"overnight sensation\" despite the fact that Hartman had been a working musician since adolescence. In an interview snippet from Portzline (2014), Hartman elaborated on another controversy related to the song\u2014stating that \u201c\u2026some people had a fit because it was my name and my voice coming out of this group that looked like the Temptations. It was a big mess, but it was the best I could do under the circumstance.\"\n\nIn the film, the Sorels are played by Stoney Jackson (lead singer), Grand L. Bush, Mykelti Williamson and Robert Townsend (the latter three portraying backing singers). In a 2012 interview, Williamson stated that people were initially confused and thought that Jackson was Hartman. As a result, Hartman was supposedly upset; however, he might have had a change of heart by the following year due to the \u201cgood publicity\u201d that the confusion generated (Tuber, 1985). Although the choreography for the Sorels was arranged by Jeffrey Hornaday, the actors eventually improvised much of the dance moves with Hornaday\u2019s support. Williamson further mentioned that he, Jackson, Bush and Townsend received vocal coaching from Jim Gilstrap and they provided background vocals for the track. In the vinyl releases, Hartman, Joe Pizzulo, and Ford are credited as providing backing vocals for the song. Thus, in the interview, Williamson may have been referring to the version that appeared in the film with Ford's vocals. Frank and George Simms, who perform as The Simms Brothers Band and worked as backup singers for artists such as David Bowie, revealed in a 2021 podcast that they sang on \"I Can Dream About You\" as a favor to Hartman but were uncredited due to the song's quick release thereafter. \n\nAccording to Daryl Hall, Hartman had initially written the song with Hall & Oates in mind, and offered the song to them to record as their own. Hall & Oates declined, as their new album was about to be released. Later in their career, however, they issued an album of covers called Our Kind of Soul, in 2004, on which they recorded their own version (with changed lyrics) of Hartman's song. When performing the song live in February 2005, Hall revealed before the performance:\"Here's a song that we did on the new album that we sort of did twenty years late. An old friend of ours, Dan Hartman, wrote this song. I remember back in the day he came up to me and said 'You know, I have this great song I wrote for you guys. It's you, you know? \u2013 you have to sing this song.' And unfortunately we had just finished an album, we couldn't put it on the album so I said sorry Dan. About six months later I was watching MTV and there it was, and it was a hit for him, God bless him. So here we are twenty years later, I hope he's hearing it, and I hope he enjoys it.\"Before Ford settled as a musician in Colorado, he went on to tour as a vocalist for artists such as The Platters, Earth, Wind & Fire, The Drifters and Phat Daddy. He died in a motor vehicle accident in 2007 in Denver.\n\nAlbum release and promotion\nBoth Hartman and Iovine worked on his 1984, same-titled solo album I Can Dream About You, following the song's use in the film. The album would spawn two other Top 40 charting singles on the US Billboard Hot 100 \u2013 \"We Are the Young\" and \"Second Nature\". A tour was also organized to promote the I Can Dream About You album and its singles, and Hartman toured alongside Toto in 1985. It was his first tour in a decade but also his last. The song was performed on this tour.\n\nMusic videos and promotion\nTwo music videos accompanied the song. One does not feature Hartman and consists of scenes from Streets of Fire, intercut with footage of the fictional Sorels miming the song as part of a live performance.  In the second video, filmed at the Hard Rock in London, Hartman appears as a bartender trying to charm a young woman (played by Joyce Hyser), singing to her as the Sorels' performance plays on a TV set hanging above the bar. In a 2010 interview with Hyser for the blog Old School: Back to the 80s, she was asked how she came to feature in the video. She replied, \"I knew Dan's manager and he asked me if I would do it. We shot at the Hard Rock in London. I honestly remember very little about it, but Dan was very nice and I absolutely love that song.\" While recording a mimed TV performance of the song, Hartman explained why one music video featured actors: \"The producers and directors of Streets of Fire wanted the best of everything, so they hired the best singers, the best dancers and best actors to play the parts in the film. So the singers in \"I Can Dream About You\" who are the Sorels are actually actors, and I wrote and sang this song.\"\n\nAside from the two music videos which accompanied the song, Hartman appeared on various American and European TV shows to perform the song once it was released as a single. On the musical variety show Soul Train, during December 1984, Hartman dubbed the song with his touring band, along with \"We are the Young\", and later appeared on the show solo in May 1985 to perform both \"I Can Dream About You\" and \"Second Nature\" alone, but with live vocal. He also dubbed the song on the music-performance program American Bandstand in December 1984, with his touring band. \"Second Nature\" was also performed, and both performances aired on the January 12, 1985, episode of the show. In November 1984, Hartman and his band performed the song on Late Night with David Letterman, along with \"We Are the Young\". It was also dubbed on the American syndicated half hour television show This Week's Music, where his name was incorrectly spelled as 'Harkman'.\n\nWithin the UK, Hartman performed the song on Top of the Pops, dated August 29, 1985. He also dubbed the song on Cheggers Plays Pop, dated October 31, 1985.\n\nTrack listing\n7\" Single\n\"I Can Dream About You\" \u2013 3:50\n\"Blue Shadows\" (performed by The Blasters) \u2013 3:14\n\n7\" Single (American promo release)\n\"I Can Dream About You (Long Solo Version)\"\n\"I Can Dream About You (Short Solo Version)\" \u2013 3:51\n\n7\" Single (Brazilian release)\n\"I Can Dream About You (Vers\u00e3o Solo Longa)\"\n\"I Can Dream About You (Vers\u00e3o Solo Curta)\" \u2013 3:51\n\n7\" Single (1985 UK reissue)\n\"I Can Dream About You (Edited Version)\" \u2013 3:51\n\"Instant Replay\" \u2013 3:25\n\n12\" Single (American and Italian release)\n\"I Can Dream About You (Jellybean Remix)\" \u2013 7:31\n\"I Can Dream About You\" \u2013 4:23\n\"I Can Dream About You (Instrumental)\" \u2013 4:23\n\n12\" Single (Australian, Canadian and US #2 release)\n\"I Can Dream About You (Extended Remix)\" \u2013 5:56\n\"I Can Dream About You (Jellybean Remix)\" \u2013 7:31\n\n12\" Single (American promo release)\n\"I Can Dream About You (Jellybean Remix)\" \u2013 7:31\n\"I Can Dream About You\" \u2013 4:23\n\"I Can Dream About You (Instrumental)\" \u2013 4:23\n\n12\" Single (German release)\n\"I Can Dream About You (Jellybean Remix)\" \u2013 7:31\n\"I Can Dream About You (Extended Remix)\" \u2013 5:56\n\n12\" Single (Spanish release)\n\"I Can Dream About You (Jellybean Remix)\" \u2013 7:31\n\"I Can Dream About You (Instrumental)\" \u2013 4:23\n\"Blue Shadows\" (performed by The Blasters) \u2013 3:14\n\n12\" Single (1985 UK release)\n\"I Can Dream About You (Extended Mix)\" \u2013 5:56\n\"I Can Dream About You (7\" Version)\" \u2013 3:51\n\"Instant Replay\" \u2013 8:18\n\n12\" Single (1985 UK white label promo release)\n\"I Can Dream About You (Extended Mix)\" \u2013 5:56\n\"Instant Replay\" \u2013 8:18\n\nCritical reception\nAlex Henderson of Allmusic reviewed the I Can Dream About You album and stated \"This excellent album finds Hartman showing his enthusiasm for R&B on pop/rock gems that range from the hit title song and the anthemic \"We Are the Young\" to the Motown-tinged \"Name of the Game\" and the new wave-ish \"Electricity\".\"\n\nIn the Billboard magazine of November 3, 1984, another review of the album was published in the Pop Picks section, which meant that Billboard predicted the album to hit the top half of the chart.

She died by suicide at age 33.\n\nBiography\n\nYounus was a dancer in a red-light district in Pakistan,  when she met her future husband, Bilal Khar, the son of Ghulam Mustafa Khar, who himself is a former Governor and Chief Minister of Pakistan's largest province, Punjab. They were married for three years, with Younus eventually leaving him after she claimed he physically and verbally abused her.

He was acquitted of all charges in the incident. Younus was sent to Rome, Italy, for treatment by Tehmina Durrani, Khar's stepmother. Initially she was denied a visa, but under public pressure, she was allowed to leave for Italy. Durrani engaged the Italian cosmetic firm Saint Angelic and Italian government to treat her.

She is buried at Karachi, Pakistan, in the Defence area.\n\nLegacy\n\nHer attack, trial, and suicide received international attention, and highlighted the plight of acid attacks victims in Pakistan. There were 1,375 acid attacks in the country between 2007 and 2016; or some 153 per year; however only 56% are actually female victims or 85 per year.

Born in 1973 in Islamabad, her life changed when she was just 21 years old. Her husband, Bilal Khar, a member of one of Pakistan's wealthiest and influential families, threw acid on her face after a dispute between them. This incident left her severely disfigured and scarred for life. Despite undergoing extensive reconstructive surgeries in Italy and the United States, Fakhra continued to suffer from physical and emotional pain. She became an advocate for acid attack victims, using her own experience to raise awareness about the issue of violence against women in Pakistan. In 2003, Fakhra filed a case against Bilal Khar for the acid attack, but the legal system in Pakistan moved slowly, and the trial continued for over eight years. Despite evidence that clearly showed Bilal Khar as the culprit, he was acquitted in 2011, which led to widespread protests across Pakistan. In 2012, Fakhra committed suicide by jumping from the sixth floor of her apartment building in Rome, where she was living as a refugee. Her death was a huge loss for the human rights community, and it sparked renewed calls for justice for victims of acid attacks. Fakhra's legacy lives on in the work of organizations like the Acid Survivors Foundation, which she helped to establish, and her story continues to inspire activists fighting against violence against women worldwide.

The phrase derives its name from the concept that certain answers are likely to be an appropriate answer to a question asked in a Sunday school even if one has not heard the question. These answers include Jesus, sin, and the cross.\n\nFor example, if a Sunday school teacher were to ask the question, \"Now class, what is brown and furry and collects nuts for the winter?\", a student might respond, \"It sure sounds like a squirrel, but... is it Jesus?\" The term \"Sunday school answer\" is commonly used to criticize someone for attempting to answer a complex question with an answer that is simplistic, that has not been thought out well, or that is not connected with reality. It can also be used to criticize someone for boastfully trying to call attention to their knowledge of the Bible. \n\nAccording to James W. Fowler's stages of faith development, people who are in Stage 4, the \"Individuative-Reflective\" stage, find such answers an impediment to addressing new questions that they wish to ask.\n\nIn her book Love Letters to Miscarried Moms, Samantha Evans argues that answers dismissed as Sunday school answers \"for being obvious, corny and surface-level answers... are most often the right answers\".\n\nSome Christian educators raise the concern that kids are getting too much Sunday School, eventually leading to spiritual burnout.\n\nNational Basketball Association player Jeremy Lin said in a 2013 interview that, although he \"knew the Sunday school answers\" while he was growing up, it wasn't until he became a high school freshman and joined a youth group where he experienced \"radical love\" that he felt like he wanted to commit to Christianity.\n\nIn Mormonism\n\"Sunday school answer\" is also used in the culture of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) to refer to trite answers that one might provide to a question posed during the church's Sunday School classes. Such answers include \"reading the scriptures, praying daily, serving ... family and others, and attending the temple and ... Sunday meetings\".

The term is commonly associated with Christian Sunday schools, which are classes held on Sundays for children to learn the principles of Christianity and its teachings. The origins of the term \"Sunday school answer\" are unclear, but it is believed to have originated in the United States during the 19th century when Sunday schools became popular. Sunday schools were established as a way to teach children about the Bible and its teachings. As children were taught basic principles, certain answers became commonly understood and were frequently repeated in response to questions from students. The Sunday school answer is often characterized as an overly simplified and superficial answer that may not fully address the complexities of a particular issue or provide deep insights or explanations. However, these answers are necessary for laying a foundation of basic knowledge which can serve as a starting point for deeper understanding in later years. Sunday schools have been an integral part of religious communities for many years, and they continue to be a valuable resource for teaching children and newcomers about the principles of Christianity. While the Sunday school answer may be viewed by some as a shallow response, it serves as a necessary foundation for deeper discussions and theological exploration.

Famicom Ts\u016bshin scored the Mega-CD version of the game a 24 out of 40.\n\nGamePro later did a separate review for the 32X version, commenting that \"The strong elements of Fahrenheit on the Sega CD get even better on the 32X CD.\" Next Generation scored the 32X version two out of five stars, commenting, \"Fahrenheit is unusual in that it lets you decide where to go, something that has never been done in an FMV game before. That feature alone almost makes this game fun. However, the typically bad acting, grainy video, and lack of gameplay don't allow the fun to happen.\"\n\nReferences\n\n1995 video games\nVideo games about firefighting\nFull motion video based games\nSega video games\nSega 32X games\nSega CD games\nVideo games developed in the United States", "machine_text": "Fahrenheit, also known as Indigo Prophecy in North America, is an interactive drama video game developed by Quantic Dream and published by Atari in 2005 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, and Xbox. It was written and directed by David Cage and was one of the first video games to focus on narrative over gameplay. The game takes place in New York City in 2009 and follows the story of Lucas Kane, who wakes up in a diner bathroom covered in blood with no memory of how he got there. As the game progresses, players control other characters such as Detective Carla Valenti and Detective Tyler Miles as they try to solve the mystery of Lucas' involvement in a series of bizarre murders. The game features a unique interface where players make decisions by selecting actions and dialogue choices from a wheel-like menu. These choices affect the game's story and ultimately lead to one of multiple endings. Fahrenheit received critical acclaim upon release for its deep and complex narrative, innovative gameplay mechanics, and cinematic presentation. It was praised for its mature themes and handling of topics such as mental illness and social issues. The game also received criticism for its lack of difficulty and short length. Fahrenheit has since become a cult classic and is often cited as an influence on later narrative-driven video games such as Heavy Rain, Beyond: Two Souls, and Detroit: Become Human, all developed by Quantic Dream. In 2015, a remastered version of Fahrenheit was released for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. The remastered version featured updated graphics and controls, as well as additional content not found in the original game. Overall, Fahrenheit remains a significant milestone in the evolution of narrative-driven video games and continues to be enjoyed by players and critics alike.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2045589}

It is tied with 2005's Hurricane Katrina as the costliest tropical cyclone on record, inflicting $125\u00a0billion (2017 USD) in damage, primarily from catastrophic rainfall-triggered flooding in the Houston metropolitan area and Southeast Texas; this made the storm the costliest natural disaster recorded in Texas at the time. It was the first major hurricane to make landfall in the United States since Wilma in 2005, ending a record 12-year span in which no hurricanes made landfall at the intensity of a major hurricane throughout the country. In a four-day period, many areas received more than  of rain as the system slowly meandered over eastern Texas and adjacent waters, causing unprecedented flooding. With peak accumulations of , in Nederland, Texas, Harvey was the wettest tropical cyclone on record in the United States. The resulting floods inundated hundreds of thousands of homes, which displaced more than 30,000\u00a0people and prompted more than 17,000\u00a0rescues.\n\nThe eighth named storm, third hurricane, and first major hurricane of the extremely active 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, Harvey developed from a tropical wave to the east of the Lesser Antilles, reaching tropical storm status on August\u00a017. The storm crossed through the Windward Islands on the following day, making landfall on the southern end of Barbados and a second landfall on Saint Vincent. Upon entering the Caribbean, Harvey began to weaken due to moderate wind shear, and degenerated into a tropical wave north of Colombia, late on August\u00a019. The remnants were monitored for regeneration as it continued west-northwestward across the Caribbean and the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, before redeveloping over the Bay of Campeche on August\u00a023. Harvey then began to rapidly intensify on August\u00a024, regaining tropical storm status and becoming a hurricane later that day.\n\nWhile the storm moved generally northwest, Harvey's intensification phase stalled slightly overnight from August\u00a024\u201325; however, Harvey soon resumed strengthening and quickly became a major hurricane, attaining Category\u00a04 intensity later that day with peak 1-minute sustained winds of 130 mph. Hours later, Harvey made landfall at San Jos\u00e9 Island, Texas, at peak intensity, followed by another landfall at Holiday Beach at Category 3 intensity. Rapid weakening then ensued, and Harvey had downgraded to a tropical storm as it stalled near the coastline, dropping torrential and unprecedented amounts of rainfall over Texas. On August\u00a028, the storm emerged back over the Gulf of Mexico, strengthening slightly before making a fifth and final landfall in Louisiana on August\u00a029. As Harvey drifted inland, it quickly weakened again as it became extratropical on September\u00a01, before dissipating two days later.\n\nIn addition to the huge cost and extent of the damage it caused, Harvey caused at least 107 confirmed deaths: 1 in Guyana and 106 in the United States, the first one in Rockport, Texas. Due to the extensive damage, the name \"Harvey\" was retired in April 2018 and will not be used for another Atlantic tropical cyclone. It was replaced with \"Harold\" for the 2023 hurricane season.\n\nMeteorological history\n\nHurricane Harvey originated from a westward-moving tropical wave that emerged from Africa over the eastern Atlantic Ocean, on August\u00a012. A surface circulation slowly developed and convection consolidated around the low over the subsequent days; the system became a tropical depression on August\u00a017, roughly  east of Barbados. Maintaining its brisk westward motion, the system strengthened slightly and became a tropical storm later that day, at which time it was assigned the name Harvey. With maximum sustained winds of , Harvey made landfalls in Barbados and St. Vincent on August\u00a018 before entering the Caribbean. Hostile environmental conditions, namely wind shear, imparted weakening and caused Harvey to degenerate into a tropical wave by August\u00a019. Though it lacked an organized surface low, the remnants of Harvey continued to produce significant convection as it traversed the Caribbean Sea and Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. The system reached the Bay of Campeche in the Gulf of Mexico on August\u00a023 and soon consolidated around a new surface low.\n\nLate on August\u00a023, the remnants of Harvey regenerated into a tropical cyclone and re-attained tropical storm intensity by 18:00\u00a0UTC. Initial reorganization was slow; however, within a highly favorable environment, the system soon underwent rapid intensification as an eye developed and its central pressure quickly fell. After becoming a hurricane on August\u00a024, Harvey continued to quickly strengthen over the next day, ultimately reaching peak intensity as a Category\u00a04 hurricane. Around 03:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a026, the hurricane made landfall at peak intensity on San Jose Island, just east of Rockport, with winds of  and an atmospheric pressure of . It made a second landfall on the Texas mainland, at Rockport, three hours later in a slightly weakened state. Harvey became the first major hurricane to make landfall in the United States since Wilma in 2005.\n\nOnce Harvey moved inland, it began to rapidly weaken as its speed slowed dramatically to a crawl, and Harvey weakened to a tropical storm on August\u00a026. For about two days the storm stalled just inland, dropping very heavy rainfall and causing catastrophic flash flooding. Harvey's center drifted back towards the southeast, ultimately re-emerging into the Gulf of Mexico on August\u00a028. Once offshore, the poorly organized system struggled against strong wind shear. Deep convection persisted north of the cyclone's center near the Houston metropolitan area along a stationary front, resulting in several days of record-breaking rain. Early on August\u00a030, the former hurricane made its fifth and final landfall just west of Cameron, Louisiana with winds of . Associated convection with Harvey became focused north of the center and along a warm front on September\u00a01 as it moved further inland, indicating that the system transitioned into a post-tropical cyclone by 06:00\u00a0UTC that day. The remnants continued northeastwards before being absorbed into another extratropical system on September\u00a03.\n\nPreparations\n\nCaribbean and Latin America\n\nTropical cyclone warnings and watches for the Windward Islands were issued starting at 15:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a017, about six hours before Harvey developed. At that time, a tropical storm watch was posted for Dominica, while a tropical storm warning became in effect in Barbados, Martinique, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. All watches and warnings were discontinued by late on August\u00a018, as the storm continued westward into the Caribbean.\n\nIn Honduras, a green alert was issued for the Atl\u00e1ntida, Islas de la Bah\u00eda, Col\u00f3n, Cort\u00e9s, Gracias a Dios, Olancho, and Yoro departments. About  of precipitation was expected along the coast, while inland areas were forecast to receive  of rain. As the remnants of Harvey approached Mexico, the Civil Protection Secretary of the state of Campeche issued a blue alert, indicating minimal danger. When Harvey redeveloped at 15:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a023, the Government of Mexico issued a tropical storm watch in Tamaulipas from Boca De Catan to the mouth of the Rio Grande. The watch remained in effect until 21:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a025, after it became evident that the storm no longer posed a significant threat to that area.\n\nUnited States \nFEMA worked with the Coast Guard, Customs and Border Protection, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement to prepare for the storm and its aftermath. The agency placed disaster response teams on standby at emergency posts in Austin, Texas, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana.\n\nTexas \nUpon the NHC resuming advisories for Harvey at 15:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a023, a hurricane watch was issued in Texas from Port Mansfield to San Luis Pass, while a tropical storm watch was posted from Port Mansfield south to the mouth of the Rio Grande and from San Luis Pass to High Island. Additionally, a storm surge watch became in effect from Port Mansfield to High Island. Additional watches and warnings were posted in these areas at 09:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a024, with a hurricane warning from Port Mansfield to Matagorda; a tropical storm warning from Matagorda to High Island; a hurricane watch and tropical storm warning from Port Mansfield to the Rio Grande; a storm surge warning from Port Mansfield to San Luis Pass; and a storm surge watch from Port Mansfield to the Rio Grande. As the hurricane neared landfall on August\u00a024, an extreme wind warning\u2014indicating an immediate threat of 115\u2013145\u00a0mph (185\u2013235\u00a0km/h) winds\u2014was issued for areas expected to be impacted by the eyewall; this included parts of Aransas, Calhoun, Nueces, Refugio, and San Patricio counties. The watches and warnings were adjusted accordingly after Harvey moved inland and began weakening, with the warning discontinued at 15:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a026. By 09:00\u00a0UTC on the following day, only a tropical storm warning and a storm surge warning remained in effect from Port O'Connor to Sargent. However, watches and warnings were re-issued as Harvey began to re-emerge into the Gulf of Mexico, and beginning at 15:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a028, a tropical storm warning was in effect for the entire Gulf Coast of Texas from High Island northward.\n\nGovernor Greg Abbott declared a state of emergency for 30\u00a0counties on August\u00a023, while mandatory evacuations were issued for Brazoria, Calhoun, Jackson, Refugio, San Patricio, and Victoria counties, as well as parts of Matagorda County. On August\u00a026, Governor Abbott added an additional 20\u00a0counties to the state of emergency declaration. Furthermore, the International Charter on Space and Major Disasters was activated by the USGS on behalf of the Governor's Texas Emergency Management Council, including the Texas Division of Emergency Management, thus providing for humanitarian satellite coverage.\n\nLouisiana\nIn Louisiana, Governor John Bel Edwards declared a state of emergency for the entire state. A mandatory evacuation was ordered in Cameron Parish for the cities of Big Lake, Cameron, Creole, Grand Chenier, Hackberry, Holly Beach, and Johnson Bayou. Additionally, a voluntary evacuation was ordered in Vermilion Parish for low-lying areas south of State Highway 14. The Louisiana National Guard prepared about 500,000\u00a0sandbags and emergency boats and high-water-rescue vehicles were placed on standby should flooding occur. In New Orleans, there were concerns about whether or not the city's drainage system could handle a heavy rainfall event, with only 105\u00a0of the 120\u00a0water pumps being operational and some power turbines being out of service. The city's public schools, as well as six universities and a medical school, closed on August 29. As Harvey began re-emerging into the Gulf of Mexico on August\u00a028, the tropical storm warning in Texas from Mesquite Bay to High Island was extended eastward into Louisiana to the community of Cameron at 12:00\u00a0UTC, while a tropical storm watch was issued from Cameron to Intracoastal City.\n\nVideo briefings by officials\n\nImpacts in the Caribbean and Latin America\nWinds left residents throughout Barbados without electricity, with a majority of outages occurring in Christ Church, Saint Joseph, Saint Lucy, and Saint Michael provinces. Flooding washed one house off its foundation, while water entered some houses, forcing some people to evacuate. Bridges in Saint Andrew and Saint Joseph were damaged. Additionally, a fuel depot in Speightstown was flooded. Winds from Harvey ripped the roof off a church. In Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, nine homes were flooded and four others experienced wind damage. Also, a tree fell on a school, damaging the building. Blocked drains in Port Elizabeth resulted in more than 15\u00a0businesses being flooded. A total of 15\u00a0people were housed in shelters after the storm.\n\nStrong winds and heavy rainfall also affected Suriname and Guyana. In the former, high winds in the capital city of Paramaribo caused roof damage to the Presidential Palace and two homes, while the Torarica Hotel and Casino suffered structural impact. Additionally, four dwellings were deroofed in Commewijne and three others lost their roofs in Wanica; in the latter, the Ministry of Social Affairs building was damaged by falling trees. In Guyana, the village of Jawalla bore the brunt of the storm. Four homes were demolished, while five other residences and two shops were damaged. Several public buildings were also damaged, including the community center, the village council buildings, the nursery, and public schools. A 29-year-old woman died after her house collapsed on her.\n\nImpacts in the United States\n\nThe widespread and catastrophic effects of Hurricane Harvey resulted in one of the costliest natural disasters in United States history. An estimated 300,000\u00a0structures and 500,000\u00a0vehicles were damaged or destroyed in Texas alone. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimated total damage at $125\u00a0billion, with a 90% confidence interval of $90\u2013160\u00a0billion. The scope of flooding in areas with low National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) participation lends to the large uncertainty in the damage total. This ranks Harvey as the costliest tropical cyclone on record in the country alongside Hurricane Katrina in 2005. However, accounting for inflation and cost increases since 2005, the National Hurricane Center considers Harvey the second-costliest. Harvey was the costliest natural disaster recorded in Texas at the time, until it was surpassed in February 2021 by a severe winter storm that crippled the state's power grid, which was estimated to have cost at least $195 billion (2021 USD) in damages in Texas. Nationwide, 107\u00a0people died in storm-related incidents: 103 in Texas, 2 in Arkansas, 1 in Tennessee, and 1 in Kentucky. Of the deaths in Texas, 68 were from the direct effects of Harvey, the highest such number in the state since 1919.\n\nTexas\n\nThroughout Texas, approximately 336,000\u00a0people were left without electricity and tens of thousands required rescue. Throughout the state, 103\u00a0people died in storm-related incidents: 68 from its direct effects, including flooding, and 35 from indirect effects in the hurricane's aftermath. By August\u00a029, 2017 approximately 13,000\u00a0people had been rescued across the state while an estimated 30,000 were displaced. The refinery industry capacity was reduced, and oil and gas production was affected in the Gulf of Mexico and inland Texas. On Monday, the closure of oil refineries ahead of Hurricane Harvey created a fuel shortage. Panicked motorists waited in long lines. Consequently, gas stations through the state were forced to close due to the rush. More than 20 percent of refining capacity was affected.\n\n \nMore than 48,700 homes were affected by Harvey throughout the state, including over 1,000 that were completely destroyed and more than 17,000 that sustained major damage; approximately 32,000 sustained minor damage. Nearly 700 businesses were damaged as well. Yet the Texas Department of Public Safety stated more than 185,000 homes were damaged and 9,000 destroyed.\n\nThe hurricane also caused many people to believe that in the wild, only 10 individuals of Attwater's prairie chicken remained at most until Spring 2018, when it was discovered that there were about a dozen wild individuals left.\n\nLandfall area\n\nMaking landfall as a Category\u00a04 hurricane, Harvey inflicted tremendous damage across Aransas County. Wind gusts were observed up to  near Port Aransas. Nearly every structure in Port Aransas was damaged, some severely, while significant damage from storm surge also occurred. In Rockport, entire blocks were destroyed by the hurricane's violent eyewall winds. The city's courthouse was severely damaged when a cargo trailer was hurled into it, coming to a stop halfway through the structure. The gymnasium of the Rockport-Fulton High School lost multiple walls while the school itself suffered considerable damage. Many homes, apartment buildings, and businesses sustained major structural damage from the intense winds, and several were completely destroyed. Numerous boats were damaged or sunk at a marina in town, airplanes and structures were destroyed at the Aransas County Airport, and a Fairfield Inn in the city was severely damaged as well. About 20 percent of Rockport's population was displaced, and they were still unable to return to their homes a year after the hurricane. The first death associated with Harvey was in Rockport, caused by a house fire, the city was unable to rescue the victim due to the extreme weather conditions. Just north of Rockport, many structures were also severely damaged in the nearby town of Fulton. In the small community of Holiday Beach, catastrophic damage occurred as almost every home in town was severely damaged or destroyed by storm surge and violent winds. By the afternoon of August\u00a026, more than  of rain had fallen in the Corpus Christi metropolitan area. All of Victoria was left without water and most had no power.\n\nHouston metropolitan area flooding\n\nMany locations in the Houston metropolitan area observed at least  of precipitation, with a maximum of  in Nederland. This makes Harvey the wettest tropical cyclone on record for both Texas and the United States, surpassing the previous rainfall record held by Tropical Storm Amelia. The local National Weather Service office in Houston observed all-time record daily rainfall accumulations on both August\u00a026 and 27, measured at  and  respectively. Due to the amount of rain accumulated from Harvey, the National Weather Service added 2 new colors to the rain index representing around 50% of the maximum rainfall dropped by Harvey. Multiple flash flood emergencies were issued in the Houston area by the National Weather Service beginning the night of August 26. In Pearland, a suburb south of Houston, a report was made of 9.92\" of rainfall in 90 minutes. The  of rain in August made the month the wettest ever recorded in Houston since record keeping began in 1892, more than doubling the previous record of  in June 2001. The storm surge peaked at 6 feet at Port Lavaca, reducing outflow of rainwater from land to sea.\n\nDuring the storm, more than 800 Houston area flights were canceled, including 704\u00a0at George Bush Intercontinental Airport and 123\u00a0at William P. Hobby Airport. Both airports eventually closed. Several tornadoes were spawned in the area, one of which damaged or destroyed the roofs of dozens of homes in Sienna Plantation. As of August\u00a029, 14\u00a0fatalities have been confirmed from flooding in the Houston area, including 6 from the same family who died when their van was swept off a flooded bridge. A police officer drowned while trying to escape rising waters.\n\nAn estimated 25\u201330\u00a0percent of Harris County\u2014roughly 444\u00a0mi2 (1,150\u00a0km2) of land\u2014was submerged.\n\nLate on August\u00a027, a mandatory evacuation was issued for all of Bay City as model projections indicated the downtown area would be inundated by  of water. Flooding was anticipated to cut off access to the city around 1:00\u00a0p.m. CDT on August\u00a028.\nEvacuations took place in Conroe on August\u00a028 following release of water from the Lake Conroe dam. On the morning on August\u00a029, a levee along Columbia Lakes in Brazoria County was breached, prompting officials to urgently request for everyone in the area to evacuate.\n\nOn August 28, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began controlled water releases from Addicks and Barker Reservoirs in the Buffalo Bayou watershed in an attempt to manage flood levels in the immediate area. According to the local Corps commander, \"It's going to be better to release the water through the gates directly into Buffalo Bayou as opposed to letting it go around the end and through additional neighborhoods and ultimately into the bayou.\" At the time the releases started, the reservoirs had been rising at more than  per hour. Many people began evacuating the area, fearing a levee breach. Despite attempts to alleviate the water rise, the Addicks Reservoir reached capacity on the morning of August\u00a029 and began spilling out.\nThe NASA Johnson Space Center was closed to employees and visitors due to the flooding until September 5. Only the critical mission control staff remain and reside in the control rooms to monitor procedures of the International Space Station.\n\nDeep East Texas and Beaumont to Port Arthur area\n\nThe Beaumont\u2013Port Arthur metropolitan area also experienced torrential precipitation, including  of rainfall in Beaumont. Rising waters of the Neches River caused the city to lose service from its main pump station, as well as its secondary water source in Hardin County, cutting water supply to the city for an unknown amount of time. Flooding to the north and east of the Houston area resulted in mandatory evacuations for portions of Liberty, Jefferson, and Tyler counties, while Jasper and Newton counties were under a voluntary evacuation. One death occurred in Beaumont when a woman exited her disabled vehicle, but was swept away. In Port Arthur, the mayor stated that the entire city was submerged by water. Hundreds of displaced residents went to the Robert A. \"Bob\" Bowers Civic Center for shelter, but they were evacuated again after the building began to flood. Water entered at least several hundreds of homes in Jefferson County.\n\nLouisiana\n\nHeavy rainfall extended eastward into Louisiana, with the state recording up to  of precipitation near the town of Iowa. In the city of Lake Charles, flood waters reached  in height in some areas, with homes inundated and hundreds of people forced to evacuate in one neighborhood alone. Throughout the state, about 500\u00a0people were rescued by August\u00a028, while 269\u00a0people went to a shelter in southwest Louisiana, about 200\u00a0of whom were rescued from their homes. An EF2 tornado near Evangeline damaged four homes, one of which was destroyed. The tornado also damaged fences, a motorcycle, a pickup truck, and toppled three electrical poles.\n\nElsewhere\n\nRain-slicked roads were blamed for two fatal accidents in Arkansas. In Alabama, a tornado in the vicinity of Reform damaged two homes and destroyed a barn along State Route 17, while four people were hospitalized for their injuries. A possible tornado in Lamar County near Kennedy\ncaused damage to trees and roofs. In Tennessee, more than 19,000\u00a0people lost electricity in Memphis. Low-lying streets in the area were inundated with water. One indirect death occurred in Memphis due to a weather-related head-on collision of a car and a tractor trailer on Interstate 40. Heavy rainfall in Nashville inundated a number of roads and flooded an apartment complex, resulting in the evacuation of 13\u00a0people. Overall, about 50\u00a0people in the city evacuated from flooded areas. Rain in Kentucky was blamed for a fatal car accident.\n\nOn September 1, the outer bands of Harvey's remnants passed through North Carolina. Severe weather was reported across the central part of the state. Tornadoes touched down in Angier, Clayton, and Smithfield, high wind knocked out power in Fuquay-Varina, Sanford, and Holly Springs, and large hail hit parts of Wake, Harnett, and Johnston counties. In Willow Spring, hail larger than softballs damaged homes and cars. Flash flooding hit Greenville further east.\n\nEnergy production\n\nEnergy production in the Gulf of Mexico declined in the wake of Harvey by approximately 21% \u2014 the output dropped to 378,633 barrels per day from the original 1.75 million barrels of oil produced each day. The Eagle Ford Rock Formation (shale oil and gas) in southern Texas reduced production by 300,000 to 500,000 bpd, according to the Texas Railroad Commission. Many energy-related ports and terminals closed, delaying about fourteen crude oil tankers. About 2.25 million bpd of refining capacity was offline for several days; that is about 12% of total US capacity, with refineries affected at Corpus Christi, and later Port Arthur and Beaumont, and Lake Charles, Louisiana. The price of Brent crude versus West Texas Intermediate crude oil achieved a split of U.S.\u2009$5.\n\nTwo ExxonMobil refineries had to be shut down following related storm damage and releases of hazardous pollutants. Two oil storage tanks owned by Burlington Resources Oil and Gas collectively spilled 30,000\u00a0gallons of crude in DeWitt County. An additional 8,500\u00a0gallons of wastewater was spilled in the incidents.\n\nOn August 30, the CEO of Arkema warned one of its chemical plants in Crosby, Texas, could explode or be subject to intense fire due to the loss of \"critical refrigeration\" of materials. All workers at the facility and residents within  were evacuated. Eight of the plant's nine refrigeration units failed without power, enabling the stored chemicals to decompose and become combustible. Two explosions occurred around 2:00\u00a0a.m. on August\u00a031; 21\u00a0emergency personnel were briefly hospitalized.\n\nDue to the shutdown in refineries, gas prices did see an increase nationwide. However, the increase was not as extensive as Hurricane Katrina. Additionally, Harvey's impact coincided with Labor Day Weekend, which sees a traditional increase in gas prices due to the heavy travel for that weekend. Nonetheless, the spike brought the highest gas prices in two years.\n\nSports\n\nThe flooding in Houston from the storm required the traditional Governor's Cup National Football League preseason game between the Dallas Cowboys and the Houston Texans scheduled for August 31 to be moved from NRG Stadium in Houston to AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. The game was later cancelled to allow the Houston Texans players to return to Houston after the storm. In addition, the Houston Astros were forced to move their August 29\u201331 series with the Texas Rangers from Minute Maid Park in Houston to Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida; ironically, just two weeks later, Hurricane Irma would force the stadium's regular tenants, the Tampa Bay Rays, to move three home games to Citi Field in New York City. In the aftermath, the Houston Astros began to wear patches which had the logo of the team with the word \"Strong\" on the bottom of the patch, as well as promoting the hashtag Houston Strong, prominently displaying them as the Astros won the 2017 World Series. Manager A. J. Hinch has stated in an interview that the team wasn't just playing for a title, but to help boost moral support for the city. The annual Texas Kickoff game that was to feature BYU and LSU to kick off the 2017 college football season was moved to the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans. The NCAA FBS football game between Houston and UTSA was postponed due to the aftermath of the storm. It was originally scheduled for September 2 at the Alamodome in San Antonio and was ultimately canceled.\n\nThe Houston Dynamo rescheduled a planned Major League Soccer match against Sporting Kansas City on August 26 to October 11. The Houston Dash of the National Women's Soccer League rescheduled their August 27 match against the North Carolina Courage to a later date. Both teams moved their training camps to Toyota Stadium in Frisco, Texas (near Dallas) while preparing for their next matches; the Dash's match the following week, against the Seattle Reign, was played in Frisco, with all proceeds from ticket sales benefiting an American Red Cross relief fund for hurricane victims. The Dynamo and Major League Soccer also donated a combined $1 million into the hurricane relief fund, while also opening BBVA Compass Stadium to accept donated supplies for processing and distribution.\n\nAthletic events were rescheduled as far away as Kentucky, where the storm's remnants were expected to cause heavy rains on September 1, interfering with Friday night high school football. More than 50 high schools in the state moved games that had been scheduled for Friday to either Thursday or Saturday.\n\nAftermath\n\nTexas\nHouston Mayor Sylvester Turner imposed a mandatory curfew on August\u00a029 from midnight to 5\u00a0a.m. local time until further notice. He cited looting as the primary reason for the curfew. On August\u00a029, President Trump, First Lady Melania Trump, and U.S. Senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz toured damage in the Corpus Christi metropolitan area. President Trump made a formal request for $5.95\u00a0billion in federal funding on August\u00a031 for affected areas, the vast majority of which would go to FEMA.\n\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott deployed the state's entire National Guard for search and rescue, recovery, and clean up operations due to the devastating damage caused by the storm and resulting floods. Other states' National Guard's have offered assistance, with several having already been sent. Meanwhile, the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement assigned approximately 150 employees from around the country to assist with disaster relief efforts, while stating that no immigration enforcement operations would be conducted.\n\nApproximately 32,000\u00a0people were displaced in shelters across the state by August\u00a031. The George R. Brown Convention Center, the state's largest shelter, reached capacity with 8,000\u00a0evacuees. The NRG Center opened as a large public shelter accordingly. More than 210,000\u00a0people registered with FEMA for disaster assistance.\n\nThe Cajun Navy, an informal organization of volunteers with boats from Louisiana, deployed to Texas to assist in high-water rescues.\n\nThe Houston Independent School District announced that all students on any of the district's campuses would be eligible for free lunch throughout the 2017\u201318 school year. The Federal Department of Education eased financial aid rules and procedures for those affected by Harvey, giving schools the ability to waive paperwork requirements; loan borrowers were given more flexibility in managing their loan payments. A 36-year-old inmate sentenced to death for a 2003 murder was granted a temporary reprieve as a result of Harvey, as his legal team was based in Harris County, an area heavily affected by the hurricane.\n\nBy August\u00a030, corporations across the nation collectively donated more than $72\u00a0million to relief efforts, with 42\u00a0companies donating at least $1\u00a0million. Professional athletic teams, their players, and managers provided large donations to assist victims of the storm. The Houston Astros pledged $4\u00a0million to relief along with all proceeds from their home game raffles. Houston Rockets owner Leslie Alexander also donated $4\u00a0million to the cause. A fundraiser established by Houston Texans defensive lineman J. J. Watt exceeded $37\u00a0million. For his efforts, Watt received the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award. The Texas Rangers and Tennessee Titans both provided $1\u00a0million, while the New England Patriots pledged to match up to $1\u00a0million in donations to the Red Cross. Multiple Hollywood celebrities also pitched in, collectively donating more than $10\u00a0million, with Sandra Bullock providing the largest single donation of $1\u00a0million. Leonardo DiCaprio provided $1\u00a0million to the United Way Harvey Recovery Fund through his foundation. President Donald Trump donated $1\u00a0million to 12 charities involved in relief efforts. Rachael Ray provided donations totaling $1\u00a0million to animal shelters across the Houston area.\n\nEconomic loss estimates\n\nMoody's Analytics initially estimated the total economic cost of the storm at $81 billion to $108 billion or more; most of the economic losses are damage to homes and commercial property. Reinsurance company Aon Benfield estimated total economic losses at $100\u00a0billion, including $30\u00a0billion in insured damage, making Harvey the costliest disaster in 2017 by their calculations. USA Today reported an AccuWeather estimate of $190 billion, released August 31. On September 3, Texas state governor Greg Abbott estimated that damages will be between $150\u00a0billion and $180\u00a0billion, surpassing the $120\u00a0billion that it took to rebuild New Orleans after Katrina. According to weather analytics firm Planalytics, lost revenue to Houston area retailers and restaurants alone will be approximately $1 billion. The Houston area controls 4% of the spending power in the United States.\n\nIn September\u00a02017, the Insurance Council of Texas estimated the total insured losses from Hurricane Harvey at $19\u00a0billion. This figure represents $11\u00a0billion in flood losses insured by the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), $3\u00a0billion in \"insured windstorm and other storm-related property losses\"; and about $4.75\u00a0billion in insured flood losses of private and commercial vehicles. By January\u00a01, 2018, payouts from the NFIP reached $7.6\u00a0billion against total estimated losses of $8.5\u20139.5\u00a0billion. Economists Michael Hicks and Mark Burton at Ball State University estimated damage in the Houston metropolitan area alone at $198.63\u00a0billion. Preliminary reporting from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration set a more concrete total at $125\u00a0billion, making Harvey the 2nd costliest tropical cyclone on record, behind Hurricane Katrina with 2017\u00a0costs of $161\u00a0billion (after adjusting for inflation).\n\nA significant portion of the storm's damages are uninsured losses. Regular homeowner insurance policies generally exclude coverage for flooding, as the NFIP underwrites most flood insurance policies in the US. Although the purchase of flood insurance is obligatory for federally guaranteed mortgages for homes within the 100-year flood plain, enforcement of the requirement is difficult and many homes, even within the 100-year flood plain, lack flood insurance. In Harris County, Texas\u2014which includes the city of Houston\u2014only 15% of homes have flood insurance policies issued by the NFIP. Participation in the NFIP is higher, but still low, in neighboring Galveston (41%), Brazoria (26%), and Chambers Counties (21%). Homeowners sued authorities after reservoir releases damaged homes.\n\nFederal government response\n\nOn September\u00a08, President Donald Trump signed into law H.R. 601, which among other spending actions designated $15\u00a0billion for Hurricane Harvey relief.\n\nNon-governmental organization response\nThe American Red Cross, Salvation Army, United Methodist Committee on Relief (UMCOR), Gulf Coast Synod Disaster Relief, United States Equestrian Federation, Humane Society of the United States, Knights of Columbus, Samaritan's Purse, Catholic Charities USA, AmeriCares, BakerRipley, Operation BBQ relief, many celebrities, and many other charitable organizations provided help to the victims of the storm. Anarchists (including Antifa) also provided relief. Business aviation played a part in the rescue efforts, providing support during the storm as well as relief flights bringing in suppliers in the immediate aftermath.\n\nVolunteers from amateur radio's emergency service wing, the Amateur Radio Emergency Service, provided communications in American Red Cross shelters in South Texas.\n\nMany corporations also contributed to relief efforts. Operation BBQ relief had the help from several local individuals and businesses kick off the support of providing meals for volunteers and victims. Smokers, pallets of wood, and another company came up with the pounds of pork to kick off the support effort.\nOperation BBQ relief vendors volunteering for the Houston flood relief estimates that they will serve at least 450,000\u00a0meals. On August\u00a027, 2017, it was estimated that Operation BBQ relief will be expecting 25,000 to 30,000\u00a0meals a day.\n\nOn August\u00a027, 2017, KSL-TV, KSL Newsradio, FM100.3, and 103.5 The Arrow created a fundraiser to help Texas residents impacted by Hurricane Harvey. Because of an anonymous donor willing to match $2 for every $1 raised up to a total of $100,000, Peter Huntsman also agreed to match donations up to $100,000. The combined total of $200,000 was met by August\u00a031, 2017. Their new goal is $1\u00a0million.\n\nForeign government response\nSingapore dispatched Boeing CH-47 Chinook helicopters from the Republic of Singapore Air Force to areas affected by the hurricane for humanitarian operations, working alongside the Texas National Guard. Israel pledged $1\u00a0million in relief funds for restoration of non-state run communal infrastructure. Mexico sent volunteers from the Mexican Red Cross, firemen from Coahuila, and rescue teams from Guanajuato to Houston to assist in relief. Mexico later rescinded their commitment for aid after Hurricane Katia made landfall on Mexico's Gulf Coast, on September\u00a09, 2017. Venezuela offered $5\u00a0million through the state-owned Citgo Petroleum, which operates a refinery in Corpus Christi.\n\nHealth and environmental hazards in flood waters\nHouston officials stated that the Houston drinking water and sewer systems were intact; however, \"hundreds of thousands of people across the 38\u00a0Texas counties affected by Hurricane Harvey use private wells, according to an estimate by Louisiana State University researchers, and those people must fend for themselves.\" Additionally, Harris County, which includes Houston, contains a large number of Superfund-designed brownfield sites that contain a wide variety of toxins and carcinogens. Two Superfund sites in Corpus Christi were flooded.\n\nBaby boom\nIn the months after the hurricane struck, some hospitals in Texas saw a spike in birth rates, with a 17% increase in birth rates being reported at Corpus Christi Medical Center. A similar, larger baby boom also occurred after Hurricane Sandy in 2012.\n\nRetirement\n\nOn April 11, 2018, at the 40th session of the RA IV hurricane committee, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Harvey from its rotating name lists, due to the extensive damage and loss of life it caused along its track, particularly in the state of Texas, and its name will never again be used for another Atlantic hurricane. It will be replaced with Harold for the 2023 season.\n\nEnvironmental factors\n\nHouston is located in the southeastern United States on the Gulf Coastal Plain, and its clay-based soils provide poor drainage. There is a tendency for storms to move very slowly over the region, allowing them to produce tremendous amounts of rain over an extended period, as occurred during Tropical Storm Claudette in 1979, and Tropical Storm Allison in 2001. The area is a very flat flood plain at shallow gradient, slowly draining rainwater through an intricate network of channels and bayous to the sea. The main waterways, the San Jacinto River and the Buffalo Bayou, meander slowly, laden with mud, and have little capacity for carrying storm water.\n\nUrban development\nHouston has seen rapid urban development (urban sprawl), with absorbent prairie and wetlands replaced by hard surfaces which rapidly shed storm water, overwhelming the drainage capacity of the rivers and channels. Between 1992 and 2010, almost 25,000 acres of wetlands were lost, decreasing the detention capacity of the region by four billion gallons. However, Harvey was estimated to have dropped more than fifteen trillion gallons of water in the area.\n\nThe Katy Prairie in western Harris County, which once helped to absorb floodwaters in the region, has been reduced to one quarter of its previous size in the last several decades due to suburban development, and one analysis discovered that more than 7,000 housing units have been built within the 100-year floodplain in Harris County since 2010.\n\nSubsidence\nAs Houston has expanded, rainwater infiltration in the region has lessened and aquifer extraction increased, causing the depletion of underground aquifers. When the saturated ground dries, the soil can be compressed and the land surface elevation decreases in a process called subsidence. Subsidence can also occur due to sediment settling. Specifically, regions to the north and west of the Houston metro have seen  to  of subsidence per year. While oil extraction can cause subsidence, in the Houston-Galveston area, most oil has been extracted from sandstone that has relatively negligible ability to compress once oil has been removed. Thus, oil extraction has not resulted in significant subsidence. Further, the volume of oil extraction in the Houston area is too low to cause significant subsidence.\n\nClimate change\n\nThe Gulf of Mexico is known for hurricanes in August, so their incidence alone cannot be attributed to global warming, but the warming climate does influence certain attributes of storms. Studies in this regard show that storms tend to intensify more rapidly prior to landfall. Weather events are due to multiple factors, and so cannot be said to be caused by one precondition, but climate change affects aspects of extreme events, and very likely worsened some of the impacts of Harvey. In a briefing, the World Meteorological Organization stated that the quantity of rainfall from Harvey had very likely been increased by climate change.\n\nHarvey approached Houston over sea-surface waters which were significantly above average temperatures. Warm waters provide the main source of energy for hurricanes, and increased ocean heat can result in storms being larger, more intense and longer lasting, in particular bringing greatly increased rainfall. Sea level rise added to the resulting problems. According to officials from the Harris County Flood Control District, Harvey caused the third '500-year' flood in three years. The National Climate Assessment states:\n\nWarmer air can hold more water vapor, in accordance with the Clausius\u2013Clapeyron relation, and there has been a global increase of daily rainfall records. Regional sea surface temperatures around Houston have risen around 0.5\u00a0\u00b0C (0.9\u00a0\u00b0F) in recent decades, which caused a 3\u20135% increase in moisture in the atmosphere. This had the effect of allowing Harvey to strengthen more than expected. The water temperature of the Gulf of Mexico was above average for this time of the year, and likely to be a factor in Harvey's impact. Within a week of Harvey, Hurricane Irma formed in the eastern Atlantic, due to the similar conditions involving unusually warm seawater. Some scientists fear this may be becoming a 'new normal'. Also higher sea-water temperatures can make hurricanes more devastating.\n\nThe slow movement of Harvey over Texas allowed the storm to drop prolonged heavy rains on the state, as has also happened with earlier storms. Harvey's stalled position was due to weak prevailing winds linked to a greatly expanded subtropical high pressure system over much of the US at the time, which had pushed the jet stream to the north. Research and model simulations have indicated an association between this pattern and human-caused climate change.\n\nSee also\n\nWeather of 2017\nTropical cyclones in 2017\n List of Category 4 Atlantic hurricanes\n List of Texas hurricanes (1980\u2013present)\n List of costliest Atlantic hurricanes\n List of wettest tropical cyclones\n Great Flood of 1862\u00a0\u2013 An ARkStorm event that dropped similar amounts of rainfall in California\n Cyclone Hyacinthe (1982)\u00a0\u2013 The wettest recorded tropical cyclone worldwide\n Hurricane Irma (2017)\u00a0\u2013 A Category\u00a05 hurricane that made landfall in Florida as a Category\u00a04 hurricane\n Hurricane Maria (2017)\u00a0\u2013 A Category\u00a05 hurricane that devastated Puerto Rico as a high-end Category\u00a04\n Hurricane Florence (2018)\u00a0\u2013 Another Category\u00a04 hurricane in 2018 that stalled over the coast of the Carolinas as a Category\u00a01 and caused catastrophic flooding\nOther tropical cyclones that made landfall in the same region of the Texas Gulf coast\n 1886 Indianola hurricane\u00a0\u2013 Destroyed the burgeoning port city of Indianola\n 1900 Galveston hurricane\u00a0\u2013 Deadliest natural disaster in US history, impacting Galveston with unmitigated storm surge and killing as many as 12,000\n 1932 Freeport hurricane\u00a0\u2013 Rapidly intensifying Category\u00a04 hurricane that brought heavy rainfall to the Angleton and Freeport areas\n Hurricane Carla (1961)\u00a0\u2013 Another storm that made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane\n Hurricane Celia (1970)\u00a0\u2013 Produced destructive winds in the Corpus Christi area\n Hurricane Alicia (1983)\u00a0\u2013 A Category 3 hurricane that affected Galveston and Houston\n Tropical Storm Allison (2001)\u00a0\u2013 Another damaging tropical cyclone that stalled over southeastern Texas, flooding the region\n Hurricane Ike (2008)\u00a0\u2013 Another Category 4 hurricane that caused devastation in Texas\n Tropical Storm Imelda (2019)\u00a0\u2013 Weak tropical cyclone which caused similar extreme flooding in the same region\n Hurricane Nicholas (2021)\u00a0- A minimal Category 1 hurricane which made landfall in similar areas\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\n\nHurricane Harvey Advisory Archive\nHarvey Could Be America's First $200 Billion Hurricane, but Other Estimates Are More Conservative\nEMSR229: Hurricane Harvey in Texas (delineation maps) \u2013 Copernicus Emergency Management Service\n\n \nFloods in Texas\n2017 Atlantic hurricane season\nCategory 4 Atlantic hurricanes\nHurricane Harvey\nHurricane Harvey\nHurricane Harvey\nArticles containing video clips\nAtlantic hurricanes in Mexico\nHurricane Harvey\nHurricane Harvey\nHurricane Harvey\nHouston hurricanes\nTropical cyclones that lingered over Texas\nHurricanes in Barbados\nHurricanes in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines\nHurricanes in the Windward Islands\nRetired Atlantic hurricanes\nTropical cyclones in 2017", "machine_text": "Hurricane Harvey was the first major hurricane to make landfall in the United States since Wilma in 2005, striking the Texas Gulf Coast in late August 2017. The storm was initially classified as a tropical storm on August 17, but it rapidly intensified over the Gulf of Mexico and reached Category 4 intensity before making landfall near Rockport, Texas on August 25. Houston, the fourth-largest city in the United States, was hit particularly hard by the storm, with severe flooding causing billions of dollars in damage and claiming dozens of lives. Harvey produced a record-breaking amount of rainfall, with some areas receiving more than 60 inches of rain over a five-day period. The storm caused catastrophic flooding in the Houston metropolitan area, which is home to more than six million people. The flooding was compounded by the release of water from nearby reservoirs, which overflowed and added to the already-swollen river systems. In addition to the damage caused by flooding, many homes and businesses in the region were damaged or destroyed by high winds and storm surge. The storm also disrupted oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico, causing prices to rise in the aftermath of the disaster. In the days and weeks following the storm, volunteers and aid organizations from across the country descended on the region to assist with rescue and recovery efforts. The response to the disaster was overwhelming, with many people donating money, supplies, and their time to help those affected by the storm. Hurricane Harvey is widely considered to be one of the worst natural disasters in United States history, with total damages estimated to be in the billions of dollars. The storm's impact on the Gulf Coast region will be felt for years to come, as communities work to rebuild and recover from the devastation left in its wake.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 55016388}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Thomas Martin (Conservative politician)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Thomas Ballantyne Martin (13 November 1901 \u2013 28 January 1995) was a British politician, stockbroker and journalist. After an early career as a private secretary he was unexpectedly elected as a Conservative Member of Parliament in Blaydon, a traditionally extremely secure Labour constituency. After standing up in Parliament for the local mining industry he opted out of defending his seat, and could not find election elsewhere; he then became a political journalist. After wartime service in intelligence, he supported Winston Churchill's attempt to bring European unity and then became a stockbroker. A very clubbable man, he attracted interest in the 1990s as a rare survivor of the pre-Second World War Parliament.\n\nEducation\nMartin was the son of Angus Martin, a surgeon from Forest Hall in Northumberland; his mother Robina was from Wooler. He grew up in the borders area but went to Giggleswick School boarding school, and later matriculated at Jesus College, Cambridge where he graduated with a Master of Arts.\n\nElection in Blaydon\nDuring the 1920s Martin worked as a private secretary, and was on the staff of the Turkish Embassy in London as its English Secretary in 1928 and in 1930\u201331. He undertook a lecture tour of Germany in 1929. In October 1931, when the general election was already underway, he was adopted as Conservative Party candidate for the constituency of Blaydon in County Durham; the seat had a Labour majority of 13,374 and was thought absolutely safe. However Martin was elected with a majority of 496 as part of the landslide election victory of the National Government; his win was the only time that the seat had been won by a Conservative.\n\nUnparliamentary language\nMartin's first recorded contribution in the chamber of the House of Commons came in December 1931 during bad tempered scenes. Angered by opposition Members jeering at Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald he was overheard by Labour MP Valentine MacEntee shouting out \"Lie down, dog!\"; MacEntee raised a point of order and challenged him to repeat it outside. The Deputy Speaker Robert Bourne pronounced it unparliamentary and urged Martin to restrain his exuberance.\n\nMining industry\nIn Parliament, Martin concentrated on issues which affected the working lives of his mining constituents. In May 1932 he made his maiden speech on the Coal Mines Bill, urging a system where the mine owner had a guaranteed profit, while the miner had a guaranteed minimum wage, with additions according to the business done. He also endorsed a voluntary national levy on the coal trade to help exports. He accepted that other industries should not be sacrificed to help the coal trade, but urged that operating theatres be set up near to mines to help miners who had suffered industrial accidents.\n\nMartin moved an amendment to the 1933 Budget to limit the tax on hydrocarbon oils to no more than 10%. The Government opposed his amendment and the House of Commons rejected it by 228 to 58. He also voted against the Government and in support of an amendment to remove the profits of Co-operative Societies from tax. He initially supported the National Government's efforts to help distressed areas, urging that the grants be continued until the Unemployment Act replaced them, but by December 1934 was disappointed on behalf of himself and other younger supporters of the Government to find the latest proposals which would not help the basic industries. Martin stated that he could not go back to depressed areas in his constituency and tell them that the Government's policy was a solution to all their problems.\n\nGermany\nWhile a member of parliament, Martin visited Germany where he met leading Nazis Hitler, Goering and Goebbels; he was invited to a Nuremberg rally, but also visited Dachau. When he returned to Britain, Martin warned fellow members of parliament about the dangers of Nazism. He was one of 31 members of parliament to sign a letter endorsing an All-India Federation with provincial autonomy as a way forward of constitutional reform in India.\n\n1935 election\nHe was also much preoccupied with pushing forward a new constitution for the University of Durham. Preparing for the next general election, Martin decided not to defend Blaydon, but was instead adopted as candidate for Camberwell North in inner south London in May 1935. The sitting MP Arthur Bateman had stepped down although at one stage considered standing for neighbouring Peckham as an Independent candidate.\n\nAt the previous election, Camberwell North had produced a Conservative majority of 765, almost as small as at Blaydon. Martin joined the other Conservative candidates for Camberwell divisions in inviting Winston Churchill to speak for them; but observers expected that the leading Labour personality Charles Ammon would succeed in regaining the seat he had lost four years previously. Martin was in the end beaten by nearly two to one, with a substantial majority of 5,777 against him.\n\nDaily Telegraph journalist\nAfter losing his seat, Martin returned to the Palace of Westminster the next year as a political correspondent of The Daily Telegraph, where he remained until 1940. He was also assistant editor of The Spectator, becoming a regular houseguest of Lady Londonderry and of the Astor family at Cliveden. He was a liaison officer between the Foreign Office and the BBC and then volunteered for military service during the Second World War, becoming a Squadron Leader in the Middle East Intelligence Centre (part of the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve) from 1940 to 1943, then leaving the services to become adviser on public relations to the United Kingdom High Commissioner in Australia where he remained until the end of the war.\n\nEuropean unity\nIn the 1945 general election, Martin was the Conservative Party candidate in Houghton-le-Spring where he was defeated by 21,866 votes. Martin then became secretary of the United European Movement in 1947, working closely with Winston Churchill for a year before becoming Secretary of the British all-party delegation to the Congress of Europe at The Hague in 1948. There Churchill developed his support for European unity, an attitude of which Martin approved. Martin regretted that Churchill did not maintain his enthusiasm when he returned to government in 1951.\n\nLater life\nMartin developed his career by becoming a member of the London Stock Exchange in 1949, but retained his interest in politics and contributed many letters to newspapers. In 1953 he married for the first time, Jean Bennett; they had two daughters. In 1964 Martin and Dr Charles Goodson-Wickes reformed the Kit Cat Club as an attempt to restart an 18th-century Whig dining club; it gathered a significant membership, many of whom entered public life (Dr Goodson-Wickes himself became a member of parliament). After his retirement from the Stock Exchange in 1974, Martin moved back to the borders area of Northumberland where he lived at Naworth Keep and Dacre Castle. He retained his membership of Pratt's Club where he was said to be \"in his element leading the conversation at the head of the table\"; so welcome was he at the club that when he resigned his membership owing to the decreasing number of visits to London, the club proprietor the Duke of Devonshire refused to accept it and waived the subscription to keep him.\n\nIn 1990 the Speaker of the House of Commons Bernard Weatherill held a dinner in honour of the 23 remaining pre-war MPs at which Martin was one of the star guests; he was interviewed by the BBC afterwards. He appeared in a 1994 documentary on \"Westminster at War\" which interviewed the survivors of the era about what political life was like. He remained mentally alert but in his later years became physically infirm, which he recognised as \"a downward glide\" to a serene death.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\n1901 births\n1995 deaths\nAlumni of Jesus College, Cambridge\nBritish male journalists\nConservative Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies\nPeople educated at Giggleswick School\nStockbrokers\nUK MPs 1931\u20131935\nPeople from Blaydon-on-Tyne\nRoyal Air Force Volunteer Reserve personnel of World War II\nRoyal Air Force squadron leaders", "machine_text": "Thomas Martin (born 8 December 1975) is a British Conservative Party politician who has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for his local constituency of Coldstream and district since the 2019 general election.

These figurines have been dated to around 23,000 years ago, during the Upper Paleolithic period. They are notable for their unique physical characteristics, which have led to speculation about the beliefs and rituals of the people who created them. The Venus figurines of Gagarino are small, roughly carved sculptures made from ivory, bone, and stone. They are typically between 4 and 8 centimeters tall and have exaggerated body parts, especially the hips and breasts. Some of the figurines also have incised lines that suggest clothing or other adornments. The significance of these figurines is debated among historians and archaeologists. Some argue that they were objects of worship or fertility symbols, while others see them as representations of human beings or simply decorative items. However, their similarities to other female figurines found throughout Europe suggest that they were part of a larger cultural tradition. One theory about the Venus figurines of Gagarino is that they were used in shamanic rituals. The exaggerated features of the figurines may have been intended to represent the mystical powers of the women who were the focus of these rituals. Alternatively, the figurines may have been used in ancestor worship or as part of funerary practices. Despite the uncertainties surrounding the Venus figurines of Gagarino, they offer an intriguing glimpse into the beliefs and practices of prehistoric societies.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"The Mother/Child Papers\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Mother/Child Papers is Alicia Ostriker\u2019s fourth book of poetry.  It was originally published by Momentum Press in 1980 and was re-published in 1986 and 2009.  The book is divided into four sections, and draws inspiration from the events of the Vietnam War era and Ostriker's personal experiences with motherhood.  In the work, Ostriker juxtaposes meditations on war against musings of motherhood and the experience of birth.  The many verses and prose pieces that comprise the book contrasts a woman's roles as teacher, mother, and wife, with the violence, corruption, and death of war.\n\nBackground\nOstriker began composing The Mother/Child Papers after the birth of her son, a few days following the shooting of four students at Kent State. In the work, Ostriker chronicles her fears of bringing a son into the brutal modern world with so many expectations and pre-constructed notions of what makes a great man, especially during wartime.  The title of the work similarly emphasizes its historic position by echoing The Pentagon Papers.  The Mother/Child Papers explores such topics as women's strengths, the joys and frustration of parenthood, shock and outrage over war, and the destruction of the natural environment, and challenges typical notions of mother-child relationships, female experience, and sexual perceptions of women.\n\nSummary\n\nI: Cambodia \nThe books begins with a lengthy prose section in which Ostriker recalls the events of her son, Gabriel's, May 14, 1970 birth and relates it to political developments that occurred around that time, most notably the Kent State Shootings and the beginning of Operation Total Victory, the United States invasion of Cambodia.  The three events are described in tandem, with each intertwined with the others.\n\nOstriker then tells of the births of her two older daughters.  One was delivered in a progressive Wisconsin hospital and another by midwife in England.  Ostriker says that these two experiences shaped her expectation of what childbirth should be like: \u201ca woman gives birth to a child, and the medical folk assist her.\u201d\n\nOstriker then speaks of the birth of her third child, Gabriel, at a southern California traditional hospital.  Despite having reached an agreement with her doctor about what drugs she was to be given during the procedure, while in the early stages of labor Ostriker inadvertently consented to being injected with Demerol, a sedative, thinking it was a local analgesic.  Under the effects of the Demerol, Ostriker then consented to receive a spinal anesthetic, which left her unable to feel anything from the waist down.  Upon waking, Ostriker was furious about being deprived of the experience of natural childbirth and relates the invasion of her body by the medical professionals who delivered the child to the US invasion of Cambodia.\n\nII: Mother/Child \nThe second section of the book is a series of related, untitled stream-of-consciousness poems alternating between the new mother and the child's perspective.  In these sections, Ostriker explores the intimate, even erotic, relationship between a mother and her infant child.   She expresses the different emotions she experienced towards the child during this time, from blissful admiration and boundless optimism, to bitter resentment and a wish that the \u201cleech\u201d would \u201cdie\u201d.\n\nThere are also a number of short prose sections in which Ostriker relates the events of the Kent State shooting and the immediate aftermath of Gabriel's birth.  References to war and devastation pervade both accounts; as Ostriker muses on the beauty of her child, she suddenly thinks of \u201cbabies stabbed in their little bellies / and hoisted up to the sky on bayonets\u201d.  The section ends with two titled pieces: \u201cParagraphs,\u201d a prose piece in which Ostriker examines the range of emotions new mothers feel towards their infants, ranging from almost divine love to murderous rage, and \u201cMother/Child: A Coda,\u201d in which she dispenses advice about life and consciousness to her child, alerting him to its savage, brutal nature, as well as its potential for transcendent beauty.\n\nIII: The Spaces \nThe third part of the book is the longest and is composed of a series of 16 titled prose and poetry pieces exploring life with the new child and its effects on the family.  In \u201cLetter to M.\u201d the speaker discusses the erotic pleasure inherent in nursing a child and ponders why this is never discussed in any parenting material.  The poem \u201cSong of the Abandoned One\u201d is written from the perspective of the infant's jealous and angry older sibling, begging her parents to \u201cKill the baby\u201d.  Ostriker recounts an experience with her family listening to a production of Shakespeare\u2019s Macbeth on the radio in \u201cMacbeth and the Kids In the Cabin at Chester.\u201d  In \u201cThings to Remember of Eve,\u201d Ostriker describes her daughter, Eve Ostriker, at two different stages in her life, at ages 8 and 21. In \u201cIn the Autumn of My Thirty-Seventh Birthday,\u201d Ostriker describes the sense of emptiness and depression she experienced dealing with family life, recounting also a discussion with a depressed friend, N., who refuses to take the antidepressants her psychiatrist prescribed her.  In \u201cExile,\u201d Ostriker considers the contrasting powers of love and violence, wondering when her son will grow to the point where \u201che will turn away\u201d from his mother's kisses \u201cnot to waste breath.\u201d  The poem's post-script reads, \u201cduring the evacuation of Phnom Penh, 1975.\u201d  \n\nIn the section's titular prose piece, \u201cThe Spaces,\u201d Ostriker recalls an ideal \u201cwindy, snowy January evening\u201d at home with her children.  Throughout the poem, there are a number of allusions to William Blake\u2019s Songs of Innocence, as well as a repeated lamb motif.  Ostriker\u2019s perfect winter day with her children is contrasted with her husband\u2019s discussion about entropy and the ultimate heat death of the universe.\n\nThe next poem, \u201cPropaganda Poem: Maybe For Some Young Mamas\u201d is divided into three parts.  In the first part, \u201cThe Visiting Poet,\u201d Ostriker recounts an experience she once had giving a guest lecture to a class of feminist college students.  She read the class a poem about pregnancy and was shocked when the class reacted with revulsion to the notion of motherhood.  Ostriker tries to explain that motherhood is one of the most fulfilling and empowering experiences possible for a woman to experience and that the class has been thoroughly brainwashed against it through patriarchal messages.  In part two, \u201cPostscript to Propaganda,\u201d Ostriker acknowledges that raising children is an incredibly difficult and demanding experience which wears a mother down, but she concludes the poem by asking the audience, \u201cCome on, you daughters of bitches, do you want to live forever?\u201d  The poem's last part, \u201cWhat Actually,\u201d indicts the \u201cideological lockstep\u201d that Ostriker claims dictates women's feelings on motherhood.  She goes on to explain that she believes that certain women are born to be mothers, while others simply were not.  She concludes by once more acknowledging that although raising children wears away at a person, so does anything enjoyable in life, and that those who refuse to do anything dangerous are \u201calready dead.\u201d\n\nIn \u201cThe Leaf Pile,\u201d Ostriker recounts the events of an October day when, upon catching her son trying to put something dirty in his mouth, she slapped him.  The poem explores the workings of memory and how such events can be easily forgotten by the child but remain a vivid mark of shame for the parent.  The next work is a prose piece titled \u201cThe Seven Samurai, The Dolly, and Mary Cassatt.\u201d  Ostriker remembers an evening watching Akira Kurosawa\u2019s The Seven Samurai, trying to compare it to other masculine art works in an attempt to come to a better understanding of the male perspective.  She is interrupted by her children coming to her asking for attention and assistance.  She recalls a quote by W.B. Yeats about how one must choose between the perfection of one\u2019s craft and one's life before going to help her daughter with her report on Mary Cassatt.  The next poem, \u201cThe Change\u201d explores the relationship between animate and inanimate things how it parallels the distant relationship Ostriker's daughter maintains with her as they drive to her horseback riding lessons.  In \u201cOne, To Fly,\u201d Ostriker examines the transformation of her son Gabriel as he grows up.  In nursery school, he tells her that his three wishes are to be able to fly, to be able to talk to animals, and for there to be no more war.  The poem's last stanza reveals that at age 9, Gabriel has largely lost his pacifist nature due to bullying and social pressures and now fights children who bully him.  \u201cIn the Dust,\u201d the section's penultimate poem, deals with the development of Ostriker's daughter and examines the mother's own role in helping mold her daughter into an acceptable woman in society's eyes, even if that role has made the mother personally unhappy.  In the last poem of the section, \u201cHis Speed and Strength,\u201d Ostriker meditates on seeing her son at play, overtaking her on his bicycle, using his strength for a purely creative purpose.  She also sees a group of black and white children playing together without any tension and thinks to herself that maybe \u201cit is not necessary to make hate.\u201d\n\nIV: This Power \nThe book's last section is composed of three poems, \u201cOne Marries,\u201d \u201cThis Power,\u201d and \u201cDream.\u201d  \u201cOne Marries\u201d begins with a quote from Percy Shelley\u2019s Hymn to Intellectual Beauty, \u201cTo fear himself, and love all human kind.\u201d  In this poem, Ostriker meditates upon the dynamics of marriage, comparing its necessity for balance to the crude, simple domination of Imperialism.  In \u201cThis Power,\u201d Ostriker considers the respect and attraction children feel towards their mothers, even in the most degrading and trying circumstances.  \u201cDream,\u201d the book's last poem is very brief and describes\u201ca woman / oliveskinned like an Indian / brownhaired like a European\u201d \u201cgiving birth / comfortabl[y]\u201d for days on end.\n\nCritical reception\nThe Mother/Child Papers enjoyed fairly favorable reception upon its release.  The Iowa Review said, \u201cIt is startling to read the early pages of this book: where, before this, was the literature of squalid bliss and righteous woe of taking care of an infant? It is alive in Ostriker . . . one of the most intelligent and lyrical of American poets.\u201d  The American Poetry Review said, \u201cOstriker's work details the achievement of a connection between personal history and public fact as both present themselves to a very intelligent writer . . . Nothing in the novels of Margaret Drabble is as affecting, as convincing, as a few lines of Ostriker's.\u201d \n\nIn the years after the initial release of The Mother/Child Papers, it has come to be regarded as an extremely influential book in feminist circles.  Upon its 2009 republishing, poet Eleanor Wilner remarked, \u201cSo many women shed shame and took heart from The Mother/Child Papers, which feels as fresh and necessary as ever- feminism without dogma, motherhood without sanctimony, the power of the pen dipped in blood: this time not of battle but of birth. Rejoicing at its return, I recall how far this book-awakening us to all that had been left out of literature-was ahead of the curve: gravity's rainbow, the trajectory of a culture's once heaven-bound imagination, headed back to Earth.\u201d\n\nReferences\n\n1980 poetry books\nAmerican poetry collections", "machine_text": "The Mother/Child Papers is a collection of feminist essays and poems written by Robin Morgan, originally published in 1978. The book is a seminal text in second-wave feminism, exploring the experiences of women as mothers and illuminating the connection between motherhood and patriarchal oppression. The essays and poems in The Mother/Child Papers were written in the context of Morgan\u2019s own experience as a mother and as a part of the feminist movement. They address topics such as the biology of motherhood, the myths and stereotypes surrounding motherhood, and the ways in which motherhood can be used as a tool of control and oppression by patriarchal societies. Alongside the feminist analysis of motherhood and patriarchy, the book also features a collection of poems that celebrate the joys and challenges of motherhood, presenting an alternative perspective to the dominant narratives surrounding motherhood at the time. The Mother/Child Papers has had a significant impact on feminist thought and activism, inspiring further exploration of the intersection of motherhood and feminism. The book has been reprinted several times since its original publication and continues to be widely read and studied by feminists today. Robin Morgan, the author of The Mother/Child Papers, is a prominent feminist activist and writer.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Saskatchewan Party\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Saskatchewan Party is a centre-right political party in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. Since 2007, it has been the province's governing party; both the party and the province are currently led by Premier Scott Moe. The party was established in 1997 by a coalition of former provincial Progressive Conservative and Liberal party members and supporters who sought to remove the Saskatchewan New Democratic Party (NDP) from power.\n\nThe Saskatchewan Party served as the province's Official Opposition until the provincial election on November 7, 2007. The Saskatchewan Party won 38 seats in the Legislative Assembly, and leader Brad Wall was sworn in as the province's 14th Premier on November 21, 2007. During the November 7, 2011 general election, the party won a landslide victory, winning 49 of 58 seats \u2013 the third largest majority government in Saskatchewan's history. On April 4, 2016, the party won a third consecutive mandate, capturing 51 of 61 seats, and became the first non-social-democratic party to win three consecutive elections since 1925. \nIn the 2020 provincial election, the Saskatchewan Party under Moe was re-elected to its fourth majority government.\n\nHistory\n\nOrigins of the party and political basis\nSaskatchewan politics has tended towards a two-party system, with third parties enjoying limited political success. For the first 25 years of the province's existence, political power was split between the Saskatchewan Liberal Party in government, with the Conservatives (initially the Provincial Rights Party) in opposition. The emergence of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), forerunner of the NDP \u2013 a social democratic political party formed by the coming together of various socialist, agrarian and labour groups under a united front \u2013 forced the Liberals to the right. As a result of vote-splitting with the Liberals, the Tories gradually lost ground in the Legislative Assembly, and were shut out of the chamber altogether in 1934.\n\nThe Saskatchewan Tories spent the next four decades on the margins of provincial politics. The presence of future Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, who represented a Saskatchewan riding for his entire career, was not enough to reverse this trend. The renamed Progressive Conservative Party of Saskatchewan would not return to the legislature again until 1964, when they won only one seat, only to lose it in 1967. They would not win another seat until 1975.\n\nBetween 1944 and 2007 the CCF\u2013NDP won 12 out of 17 provincial elections in Saskatchewan, and formed the government for 47 of those 63 years.\n\nIn the late 1970s, the Progressive Conservatives re-emerged as a political force, forming government under Grant Devine for most of the 1980s. However, dissatisfaction with the Conservative government towards the end of the decade resulted in it being soundly defeated by the NDP in 1991. The Conservatives lost almost half of their popular vote and retained only 10 of the 66 seats in the Legislature. A subsequent corruption scandal further weakened the Tories. The Progressive Conservatives lost further ground at the 1995 general election, falling to only five seats. At that same election, the Liberals rebounded to 11 seats and Official Opposition.\n\nThe Liberal caucus soon became bogged down in factional disputes, leading a number of Liberals to propose joining forces with the Tories in hopes of providing an alternative to the NDP. The idea had been broached several times from the 1960s onward. However, in 1997, a confidential discussion of such an idea at a Liberal caucus meeting was shouted down by MLA Gerard Aldridge.\n\nIn 1997, the Saskatchewan Party was formed by a coalition of eight MLAs: four former Progressive Conservatives (Dan D'Autremont, Ben Heppner, Don Toth, and PC leader Bill Boyd) and four former Liberals (Bob Bjornerud, June Draude, Rod Gantefoer, and Liberal caucus leader Ken Krawetz).\n\nHowever, it did not result in a formal merger between the two parties. While most Tory supporters and members joined the new party, the Progressive Conservative Party was not disbanded. Under Saskatchewan law, a party must run at least 10 candidates to retain its registration. The Tories were believed to have a significant amount of money on hand, and would have had to forfeit their assets to the government if they were ever de-registered. Instead, the Tories essentially went dormant for the next two election cycles; its assets were held in trust while a select group of party members ran paper candidates to keep the party alive.\n\nThe Saskatchewan Party attracted fewer defections from the provincial Liberals, who continue to contest elections. Despite this, former Liberal Krawetz was named as interim leader of the new party, and hence remained Leader of the Opposition.\n\nSince the new Saskatchewan Party consisted largely of former Progressive Conservatives, opponents derided it as merely a re-branding of the Progressive Conservatives in an attempt to distance the party from the still-fresh corruption scandal; then-Premier Roy Romanow often referred to the new party as the \"Saska-Tories\". This view has continued to follow the party.\n\nElwin Hermanson (1998\u20132004) \nIn 1998, former Reform Party federal house leader Elwin Hermanson was elected the party's first leader. Since Hermanson did not have a seat in the legislature, Krawetz remained as interim parliamentary leader.\n\nShortly after taking the leadership, Hermanson led the party into the 1999 provincial election. The party had a strong showing, retaking many rural ridings from the NDP. In the process, they won 25 seats, five short of victory, and reduced the NDP to a minority government.\n\nDuring the 2003 provincial election, the Saskatchewan Party campaigned on a platform of tax reduction and decreased government involvement in the private sector. The party won 28 seats, while the NDP won 30 seats. The party was accused of having undisclosed plans to privatize the province's crown corporations. Hermanson stated he would not sell the four major crown corporations, but would consider offers. The NDP used the ambiguity in the Saskatchewan Party's position to turn the election into a referendum on crown corporation ownership for many voters, and won the one seat it needed to regain a majority government. Hermanson resigned as leader shortly afterward. He stated he had taken the party as far as he could, and it was time for the party to elect a new leader who could take it further.\n\nBrad Wall (2004\u20132018) \nBrad Wall was acclaimed as the new party leader on March 15, 2004, after being the only declared candidate for the leadership. Other caucus members who expressed interest in running included Jason Dearborn, Allan Kerpan (a former Reform MP), and Ken Cheveldayoff, the MLA for Saskatoon Silver Springs who at one time was the President of the Young Progressive Conservatives of Saskatchewan.\n\nFollowing his appointment as leader, Wall undertook a review of party policies. He soon unveiled a more moderate policy platform that included plans for more treatment beds for crystal meth addicts, democratic workplaces, and a new model for economic development in Saskatchewan. With significantly revised core policies and increased emphasis on social issues, the party began to soften its image and attract voters in the cities. The party came short of victory in 1999 and 2003 because it had been almost nonexistent outside its rural stronghold. In 1999, it was completely shut out in Regina and won only one seat in Saskatoon. The 2003 election was better; while it picked up two seats in Saskatoon, it was again shut out of Regina. Had 500 votes in Regina Wascana Plains gone to the Saskatchewan Party, it would have resulted in a hung parliament; both the NDP and Saskatchewan Party would have had 29 seats apiece. In response to the results of the 2003 election, the Saskatchewan Party caucus voted in favour of the NDP's Crown Corporations Public Ownership Act, which provided legislative entrenchment for the ownership of the major crown utilities and services.\n\nIn 2004, the Saskatchewan Party's aggressive questioning of the provincial NDP government over a bad investment of public funds \u2013 SPUDCO \u2013 forced cabinet minister Eldon Lautermilch to apologize for misleading the legislature, a fact that only became apparent once sworn evidence was acquired from a civil lawsuit against the province. The party's MLAs requested a public inquiry.\n\nIn February 2006, the party released a code of ethics document for its members. It set guidelines for conduct and outlined how to deal with violators. Actions prohibited in this document include disseminating false information, pressuring prospective contributors and offering bribes to other political parties, candidates or voters. Penalties included having the offender's party membership revoked.\n\nIn March 2006, the Saskatchewan Party introduced a motion calling on the NDP government to apologize for the highly unfavourable and inaccurate portrayal of Jimmy Gardiner in Prairie Giant: The Tommy Douglas Story. The government has argued it was not responsible for the film's production, and rebuked the motion for an apology.\n\nIn 2006, in preparation for the Weyburn-Big Muddy by-election, the Saskatchewan Party was accused of using push polling by attempting to link Liberal leader David Karwacki with the Canadian gun registry. The same poll asked respondents if they linked the Saskatchewan Party with the Progressive Conservative Party of Saskatchewan. On May 16, 2006, in an effort to gain political support, Saskatchewan Party MLAs tried to associate the provincial NDP \u2013 which had vocally opposed the gun registry \u2013 with their federal party counterparts \u2013 which support it.\n\nIn 2006 the party released a taxpayer-funded advertisement for the Saskatchewan Party critical of the then-NDP administration. This ad became known for the misspelling of Saskatchewan \u2013 as \"Saskatchwan\". The ad was also criticized for having false information \u2013 for example claiming rising tuition costs, despite the government policy of a 3-year freeze in the price of tuition.\n\nOn November 23, 2006, the Saskatchewan Party tried to make a political issue about the provincial government trying to reclaim money from tobacco companies for the additional strain smokers placed on the health care system. The NDP government pointed out in response that the Saskatchewan Party had accepted a $10,000 donation from Imperial Tobacco in 2003.\n\nIn a by-election held on March 5, 2007, the Saskatchewan Party recaptured the seat in the Legislative Assembly left vacant by the death of Ben Heppner. In a first for Saskatchewan politics, Heppner's daughter \u2013 Nancy Heppner \u2013 won the seat in both the by-election and the 2007 general election.\n\nIn November 2007, the party was sued by the Progressive Conservative Party of Saskatchewan over a trust fund. The PC party alleges the fund's trustees, which contains $2.9 million, conspired with the Saskatchewan Party to deny the PC party access to their funds, and thus not be able to run candidates in the next election. The Saskatchewan Party denies involvement, even though three of the five trustees are active in the Saskatchewan Party.\n\nIn the November 7, 2007 general election, the Saskatchewan Party won 38 of the 58 seats in the legislature, allowing it to form the first centre-right government in the province since 1991, and only the third in the province's history. In its first term, the Saskatchewan Party government undertook the largest single-year income tax reduction, debt reduction, and investment in infrastructure in Saskatchewan history, while still maintaining a $1.9 billion cash balance in the Growth and Financial Security Fund.\n\nThe Saskatchewan Party government also was successful in lobbying the federal government to block the takeover bid of Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan from Australian mining giant BHP Billiton.\n\nOn November 7, 2011 general election, it won a landslide victory, winning 49 of 58 seats. All 18 cabinet ministers were re-elected, and the Saskatchewan Party captured 64.2% of the popular vote en route to the third-biggest majority government (in terms of percentage of seats won) in the province's history. The only bigger majorities came in 1934, when the Liberals won 50 out of 55 seats, and 1982, when the Tories won 55 out of 64. This resulted in the worst election showing for the NDP since 1982. The Saskatchewan Party even managed to unseat NDP leader Dwain Lingenfelter in his own riding.\n\nThe party won a third term in 2016.\n\nIn February 2017, the land dealings of the Global Transportation Hub (GTH) taken on by The Saskatchewan Party governments of Brad Wall and Scott Moe are under investigation by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) for any wrongdoing or conflicts of interest.\n\nScott Moe (2018\u2013present) \n\nWall announced his retirement from politics on August 10, 2017. He stayed on as leader until a January 2018 leadership election and premier until early February.\n\nAt that convention, second-term MLA and former Environment Minister Scott Moe was elected leader on the fifth ballot. He was sworn in as premier on February 2, 2018.\n\nIn the 2020 provincial election, the Saskatchewan Party under Moe was re-elected to its fourth majority government.\n\nFederal political affiliations\nWhile not officially aligned with any federal political party, some of the Saskatchewan Party's supporters are involved with the Conservative Party of Canada, with others being involved with the Liberal Party of Canada. In the 2004 federal election, Wall endorsed incumbent Conservative David L. Anderson, Member of Parliament for Cypress Hills\u2014Grasslands; that riding includes Swift Current, Wall's hometown.\n\nIn the 2006 federal election, Wall stated he supported the Conservative Party, but would not get involved in a federal election. The previous leader, Elwin Hermanson, was a member of the Reform and Canadian Alliance federal parties.\n\nCurrent and former Saskatchewan Conservative MPs who have been involved with the Saskatchewan Party include Carol Skelton, who served on Elwin Hermanson's constituency executive; Tom Lukiwski, who served as a General Manager of the Saskatchewan Party; Garry Breitkreuz, who supported the formation of the party; and Lynne Yelich, who worked for Allan Kerpan while Kerpan served as MP and received funding from him in the 2006 federal election. \n\nWarren Steinley and Corey Tochor are Conservative federal MPs, but also served as MLAs for the Saskatchewan Party.\n\nElectoral performance\n\nParty leaders\n\nJames Thornsteinson is the party president.\n\nSee also\nPolitics of Saskatchewan\nSaskatchewan Party leadership elections\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website\nCaucus website\nConstitution of the Saskatchewan Party (2008)\nThe Canadian Encyclopedia\nCrown Corporations Public Ownership Act (official text; PDF)\n\n1997 establishments in Saskatchewan\nConservative parties in Canada\nLiberal parties in Canada\nPolitical parties established in 1997\nProvincial political parties in Saskatchewan\nOrganizations based in Regina, Saskatchewan", "machine_text": "The Saskatchewan Party is a right-leaning political party in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. It was formed in 1997 by the merger of the Progressive Conservative Party of Saskatchewan and the Saskatchewan Party, a small right-wing party. The party has governed Saskatchewan since 2007, forming a majority government in three consecutive elections. The Saskatchewan Party's platform focuses on economic growth, low taxes, and fiscal responsibility. Its leader, Scott Moe, became Premier of Saskatchewan in 2018, succeeding Brad Wall who had led the party for 10 years. Under the Saskatchewan Party's leadership, the province has experienced significant economic growth and job creation. The party has also made investments in infrastructure and healthcare, while keeping taxes low. However, the party has faced criticism for its handling of social issues such as education and climate change. One of the Saskatchewan Party's most controversial policies was the controversial Bill 40, which removed funding for non-Catholic students from Catholic schools in the province. This move was met with protests and legal challenges, and remains a divisive issue in the province. Despite these controversies, the Saskatchewan Party remains a popular choice for voters in the province. In the 2020 provincial election, the party won a fourth consecutive majority government with 48 of 61 seats in the Legislative Assembly. Whether the Saskatchewan Party will continue to hold onto power in the province remains to be seen, but its focus on economic growth and fiscal responsibility has resonated with voters in Saskatchewan and could keep them in power for years to come.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 338065}

A music video starring guitarist and producer Warren Fitzgerald was filmed for the band's cover version of Queen's \"Don't Stop Me Now\". The album's title is a euphemism for dried semen on a casting couch. Its original cover art used lettering that parodied the logo of Variety, prompting legal action and a cease and desist order from the magazine which resulted in a replacement cover with redesigned lettering. In 2010 the magazine brought further legal action against the band over third-party uses of the original cover appearing on the internet.\n\nCover artwork controversy \nThe album's cover was a source of legal controversy. A few months after the album's release, entertainment industry magazine Variety issued a cease and desist order against The Vandals over the design of the band's name on the album cover. The design mimicked the logo of the magazine as an intentional comment on the materialistic culture of Hollywood, and the magazine accused the band of trademark infringement. The lawsuit was settled with redesigned lettering which appears on all subsequent pressings of the album.\n\nHowever, in April 2010 Variety filed a lawsuit against the band in a Delaware court, suing them over images of the original cover appearing on the internet. The magazine claimed that the band \"ignored their agreement\" and were \"misusing our mark\". The Vandals claimed that they had ceased using the parody logo per the terms of the cease and desist order, and they were not responsible for images placed on the internet by third parties:\n\nWe agreed not to use this logo anymore and we have no product for sale with this logo so their claims that we are intentionally using it and harming the Daily Variety are ludicrous. Now they are in the process of punishing us with an abusive lawsuit filed in Delaware, where none of the parties reside or do business, because this will cause us the most financial harm and when we get sick of it, and realize we can't afford to fight them, we will pay them the money. That is our opinion of what is going on because we cooperated in every way to try to take the images down, but they filed the suit anyway.... in Delaware.\n\nThe Vandals planned a benefit show to raise money to cover their legal fees, and considered legal action against Variety to lift the injunction against use of the original logo: \"After reading the public filing against us by the Daily Variety it is clear they are abusing this injunction to shake us down for money, and by filing against us when there are no prohibited images on any sites under our control, they have breached the settlement agreement between us. We did not agree to be responsible for third party distributors of this product. That was clear in the settlement agreement.\" The band promised two tickets to the benefit to anyone who was able to notify them of a usage of the Variety-mocking logo on a site under the band's control. In April 2011 The Vandals successfully petitioned to have the case moved from Delaware to California. The band used their website to taunt Variety lawyer Henry Horbaczewski and editor Peter Bart, saying \"The Plaintiffs should all be ashamed and it is the Vandals' opinion that [Variety's lawyers] are liable for malpractice damages by ruining their client's reputation in a frivolous attempt to act like Godzilla when it comes to hoarding their precious font and inhibiting protected free speech.\" Variety agreed to drop the case in February 2012. Bassist Joe Escalante, who has a background as an entertainment lawyer and represented The Vandals in the lawsuit, called it \"the worst thing that's ever happened to me, and to the band, and the hardest thing I've ever done.

The brand is known for its crispy and crunchy texture, which makes it a favorite snack among children and adults alike. The Hollywood Potato Chip was first produced by the Hollywood Brands Company based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The company was founded in 1923 by Don Schisler and his brother, Roy. They started with a single product which was a caramel and nut candy bar, named the Hollywood Bar. Later, the company introduced other products such as the Hollywood Potato Chip, which quickly became a hit. The Hollywood Potato Chip gained its popularity not only for its crisp taste and texture but also for its unique packaging. The chips were sold in a distinctive can with a Hollywood movie star's picture on it. The packaging was considered a novelty at the time and helped to increase the brand's popularity. The Hollywood Potato Chip was a favorite snack in the U.S during World War II when potato chips became scarce due to rationing. The Hollywood Brands Company continued to grow in the postwar era, and by the 1950s, it was the third-largest potato chip manufacturer in the United States. In the 1970s, the Hollywood Brands Company was bought out by Consolidated Foods Corp, which later changed its name to Sara Lee Corp. Today, the Hollywood Potato Chip brand is owned by Old Dutch Foods, a company that produces various potato chip brands.

Shah Jahan became so fond of the fort that it was here, in Shahi Qila that he establishes his court for the first three years of his ascending the throne.

The locals call the Shahi Qila 'Bhulbhulaya' (that means a labyrinth) because the architecture of the Shahi Qila is puzzling and perplexing for a casual visitor.\n \nThe main attraction at the palace is the hamam or the royal bath. It was specifically built for Shah Jahan's wife, Begum Mumtaz Mahal, so that she could enjoy a luxurious bath in water scented with khus, saffron and rose petals. Hammam Khana was constructed during Mughal Period. The baths bear an inscription of Khan Khana Mirza Abdul Rahim Khana, the famous minister of Akbar and Jahangir. The rooms have domed roof. The Hammam is beautifully decorated with paintings on honey comb work. Even today, the ceiling has many intricate paintings. One of these paintings depicts a monument which is said to have been the inspiration for the Taj Mahal.

The album was produced by Cristi\u00e1n Heyne, who also worked with Rosenthal on her previous album, Fiesta. It features collaborations with international artists such as Mexican singer Javiera Mena and Puerto Rican reggaeton singer Calle 13. The album's lead single, \"Lucha en Equilibrio,\" was released on November 24, 2017. The song addresses the balance between love and freedom in a relationship. Its music video was directed by Rosenthal herself and showcases various forms of dance. Another standout track is \"Isidora,\" which delves into the complexities of a seemingly perfect relationship and the emotional toll it takes on the individuals involved. The track features a more stripped-down production style, with Rosenthal's vocals taking center stage. In addition to the album, Rosenthal also released a book of the same name, which explores the same themes of the album through poetry and personal essays. Cambio de Piel received critical acclaim upon its release, with many praising its honesty and vulnerability. It peaked at number six on the Chilean Albums Chart and was certified Gold by the Asociaci\u00f3n Chilena de Productores de Fonogramas y Videogramas (Chilean Association of Phonographic Producers and Videographers). Overall, Cambio de Piel is a strong addition to Rosenthal's discography, showcasing both her artistry and personal growth as an artist.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 56149282}

The murder cases were widely publicized, and were featured on the television series Unsolved Mysteries in 1989.\n\nCase\n\nHarkins and Cooper\nOn August 10, 1985, Steven Harkins, 27, and his girlfriend, Ruth Cooper, 42, left their Tacoma, Washington home for a weekend camping trip at Tule Lake in Pierce County. When the two did not return to their jobs at a Tacoma vocational school the following Monday, their families reported them missing. Four days later, on August 14, hikers passing through Pierce County found Harkins' body near a remote campsite. He had been shot in the head, and his body, still in a sleeping bag, suggested he had been murdered while sleeping. Nearby, searchers also found Harkins' and Cooper's pet dog, who had been shot to death as well. At the time, law enforcement suspected that the case may have been connected to the murders of Edward Smith and Kimberly Diane La Vine, a couple from Kent, Washington who were abducted, murdered, and disposed of in a gravel pit near the Columbia River in March 1985.\n\nOn October 26, a skull was found at the dead end of Eighth Avenue South, near Harts Lake, about   from where Harkins' body was found. Dental records confirmed the skull belonged to Cooper, and two days later on October 28, her body and her purse were also recovered from the area,  from where her skull had been found. A tube sock had been tied around Cooper's neck. According to the autopsy, Cooper had died of \"homicidal violence,\" though a spokesman later stated she had died of a gunshot wound to the abdomen. After the discovery of Cooper, the murders were publicized by Crime Stoppers in an attempt to recover information leading to the arrest of those responsible.\n\nRiemer and Robertson\n\nOver a month after the discovery of Ruth Cooper, on December 12, 1985, Mike Riemer, 36, his girlfriend, Diana Robertson, 21, and their daughter, Crystal Louise Robertson, age 2, traveled from their Tacoma home to Pierce County, planning to find a camp site near the Nisqually River. Riemer, an animal trapper, also planned to check on traps he had set in the area. Later that evening, customers at a Kmart store  north in Spanaway found the couple's daughter, Crystal, standing outside the store entrance. Crystal was placed in temporary foster care until her maternal grandmother saw her photograph on a local news broadcast two days later. When asked where her mother was, the dazed two-year-old told her grandmother that her \"Mommy was in the trees.\" According to investigators, the two-year-old was \"not nearly verbal enough\" to provide any information.\n\nPolice searched the area both on foot and by air, looking for evidence of Riemer's red 1982 Plymouth pickup truck, but efforts remained fruitless. On February 18, 1986, over two months after the couple's disappearance, the body of Diana Robertson was discovered half-buried in snow by a motorist near a logging road off of Washington State Route 7 in Mineral. Bloodhounds scoured the area in the following days, but  of snowfall impeded the search. Riemer's pickup truck was also found near Robertson's body.\n\nIn the truck, police discovered a note on the dashboard that read \"I love you, Diana.\" It was written on a manila envelope. Robertson's mother claimed the handwriting was that of Riemer. Bloodstains were also found on the seat of the truck. An autopsy revealed that Diana Robertson had been stabbed seventeen times, and, as with Ruth Cooper, was also found with a tube sock tied around her neck.\n\nDue to Riemer's disappearance, investigators believed he may have been responsible for Robertson's murder, and had abandoned his daughter at the Kmart store and then subsequently fled. Police theorized that Riemer may have been responsible for Harkins' and Cooper's murders as well; an alternate theory, however, claimed that Riemer was also a victim of the same killer who had murdered Robertson, Harkins, and Cooper.\n\nIn February 1986, after the discovery of Robertson's body, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer published an article revealing that Riemer had been charged with domestic assault against Robertson on October 19, 1985. However, the couple had reconciled by December, the month in which they disappeared. Riemer, who worked as a roofer at Seattle\u2019s Queen City Sheet Metal and Roofing Inc., was described by his employer as a \"typical roofer who worked hard and played hard.\"\n\n2011 development\nOn March 26, 2011, hikers discovered a partial human skull later determined to be that of Mike Riemer. It was found in an area within a mile radius of where Robertson's body had been discovered in 1986. After recovery of the skull, Lewis County investigators stated that they believed Riemer could have been a possible victim of homicide as well, though his cause of death could not be determined. Based on the condition of the skull, however, authorities were able to rule out a gunshot wound to the head.\n\nMedia depiction\nIn September 1989, the case was featured by the series Unsolved Mysteries.\n\nSee also\nList of fugitives from justice who disappeared\nList of serial killers in the United States\nList of solved missing person cases\nList of unsolved murders\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nAudio segment on The Trail Went Cold podcast\nCase profile at unsolved.com\nMichael Lloyd Riemer at Find a Grave\nDiana Robertson at Find a Grave\n\n1980s missing person cases\n1985 in Washington (state)\n1985 murders in the United States\nAugust 1985 events in the United States\nDecember 1985 events in the United States\nAugust 1985 crimes\nDecember 1985 crimes\nAmerican murder victims\nCouples\nCrimes in Washington (state)\nDeaths by firearm in Washington (state)\nDeaths by stabbing in the United States\nFormerly missing people\nFugitives\nMissing person cases in Washington (state)\nMurder in Washington (state)\nPeople murdered in Washington (state)\nSerial murders in the United States\nUnidentified serial killers\nUnsolved murders in the United States", "machine_text": "The Mineral, Washington murders were a series of unsolved murders that took place in Mineral, Washington between 1985 and 1986.

Like the previous victims, she had been shot multiple times. Despite an extensive investigation, no arrests were ever made in connection with these murders. The case remains unsolved to this day. Several theories have been proposed regarding the identity of the killer(s), including the possibility of a serial killer. Some have also suggested that the murders may have been related to the victims' work or personal lives. In 2011, a group of retired law enforcement officials formed a task force to re-examine the case and potentially identify new leads.

The race was won by the incumbent Senator, Charles H. Percy, who was a member of the Republican Party. During the campaign, Senator Percy heavily emphasized his achievements during his first term as a senator. He was credited with being an advocate for Illinois farmers and the state's manufacturing industry. His opponent, Richard J. Lyons, was a lawyer and the Democratic candidate who ran against him on a platform of social justice and economic reforms. This election received a lot of national attention due to the important role that Illinois plays in American politics. The state has always been a key swing state that has regularly swayed between the two major parties. In 1956, Illinois had 27 electoral votes, making it the third most important state in the race for the presidency. With a total of 3,374,435 votes cast, Percy emerged as the winner with 1,723,464 votes, while Lyons received 1,649,971 votes.

It is bounded by the comuni of Barile, Ginestra, Lavello, Maschito, Montemilone, Palazzo San Gervasio, Rapolla and Spinazzola.\n\nHistory\n\nAncient\nThe city was known as Venusia (\"City of Venus\") to the Romans, who credited its establishment\u2014as Aphrodisia (\"City of Aphrodite\")\u2014to the Homeric hero Diomedes. He was said to have moved to Magna Graecia in southern Italy following the Trojan War, seeking a life of peace and building the town and its temples to appease the anger of Aphrodite for the destruction of her beloved Troy.\n\nThe town was taken by the Romans after the Third Samnite War in 291 BC and became a colony for its strategical position between Apulia and Lucania. No fewer than 20,000 men were sent there, owing to its military importance. Throughout the Hannibalic wars, it remained faithful to Rome, and had a further contingent of colonists sent in 200 BC to replace its losses in the war. In 190 BC the Appian way was extended to the town. Some coins of Venusia of this period exist. It took part in the Social War, and was recaptured by Quintus Metellus Pius; it then became a municipium, but in 43 BC its territory was assigned to the veterans of the triumvirs, and it became a colony once more. Horace was born here in 65 BC. It remained an important place under the Empire as a station on the Via Appia, though Theodor Mommsen's description of it as having branch roads to Aequum Tuticum and Potentia, and Kiepert's maps annexed to the volume, do not agree with one another.\n\nMiddle Ages\n\nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Venusia was sacked by the Heruls, and in 493 AD it was turned into the administrative centre of the area in the Ostrogothic kingdom of Italy, although later this role was moved to Acerenza.\n\nThe Lombards made it a gastaldate in 570/590.\n\nIn 842 Venosa was sacked by the Saracens, who were later ousted by Emperor Louis II.\n\nNext rulers in the 9th century were the Byzantines, who lost control of it after their defeat in 1041 by the Normans. Under the latter, Venosa was assigned to Drogo of Hauteville. In 1133 the town was sacked and set on fire by Roger II of Sicily.\n\nHis later successor Frederick II had a castle built here where a Lombard outpost existed before, which was to house the Treasury (Ministry of Finances) of the Kingdom of Sicily.\n\nFrederick's son, Manfred of Sicily, was perhaps born here in 1232. After the latter's fall, the Hohenstaufens were replaced by the Angevines; King Charles of Anjou assigned Venosa as a county to his son Robert.\n\nModern era\nAfter a series of different feudal lords, Venosa became a possession of the Orsini in 1453. Count Pirro Del Balzo, who had married Donata Orsini, built a new castle (1460\u20131470) and a cathedral.\n\nThen, under the Aragonese domination, followed the Gesualdo family (1561); amongst their number was the famous prince, musician and murderer Carlo Gesualdo.\n\nDespite the plague that had reduced its population from the 13,000 of 1503 to 6,000, Venosa had a flourishing cultural life under the Gesualdos: apart from the famous Carlo, other relevant figures of the period include the poet Luigi Tansillo (1510\u20131580) and the jurist Giovanni Battista De Luca (1614\u20131683).\n\nVenosa took part in the revolt of Masaniello in 1647. The Gesualdos were in turn followed by the Ludovisi and the Caracciolo families.\n\nHome to a traditionally strong republican tradition, Venosa had a role in the peasant revolts and the Carbonari movement of the early 19th century.\n\nA true civil war between baronial powers and supporters of the peasants' rights broke out in 1849, being harshly suppressed by the Neapolitan troops.(See Sicilian revolution of independence of 1848.)\n\nIn 1861, after the fall of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies during the Italian unification, Venosa was occupied by some bands of brigands under the command of Carmine Crocco in order to restore the Bourbon power in Basilicata.\n\nMain sights\n\nThe Aragonese castle, built in 1470 by Pirro del Balzo Orsini. It has a square plan with four cylindrical towers. The shining sun, the del Balzo coat of arms, is visible on the western towers. It was turned into a residence by Carlo and Emanuele Gesualdo, who added also an internal loggia, the north-western wing and bastions used as prisons. From 1612 it was the seat of the Accademia dei Rinascenti. It is now home to the National Museum of Venosa, inaugurated in 1991, with ancient Roman and other findings up to the 9th century. The entrance is preceded by a fountain conceded by King Charles I of Anjou.\nMany fragments of Roman workmanship are built into the walls of the cathedral, which is due to Pirro del Balzo also (c. 1470).\nThe abbey church of SS. Trinit\u00e0 is historically interesting; it was consecrated in 1059 by Pope Nicholas II and passed into the hands of the Knights of Saint John in the time of Boniface VIII (1295\u20131303). In the central aisle is the tomb of Alberada, the first wife of Robert Guiscard and mother of Bohemund. An inscription on the wall commemorates the great Norman brothers William Iron Arm, Drogo, Humfrey and Robert Guiscard. The bones of these brothers rest together in a simple stone sarcophagus opposite the tomb of Alberada. The church also contains some 14th-century frescoes. Behind it is a larger church, which was begun for the Benedictines about 1150, from the designs of a French architect, in imitation of the Cluniac church at Paray-le-Monial, but never carried beyond the spring of the vaulting.

Venosa was an important Roman city, known as Venusia, during the Roman Republic and Empire eras. This was due to its strategic location on the Appian Way, a major trade route that connected Rome to the eastern regions of the Empire. During ancient times, Venusia was the birthplace of the poet Horace, and thus, draws many visitors for this reason today. In the Middle Ages, Venosa was conquered by the Lombards, and later, by the Normans. The town was fortified during this time, and the remains of some of the fortifications can still be seen today. Over the years, Venosa has endured many natural disasters and events. In 1956, an earthquake struck the town, causing substantial damage to the historical town center. However, Venosa has been restored to its former glory and continues to attract visitors for its rich history and picturesque scenery. Today, Venosa is known for its architecture and culture. Tourists can visit the medieval castle, the Renaissance-era Palazzo Caracciolo, and the Church of Santa Maria delle Grazie, amongst other sights. Venosa is also the site of numerous cultural events throughout the year, including the famous Horace Festival, which honors the ancient Roman poet. Overall, Venosa is a beautiful town that is well worth visiting for those interested in its rich history and cultural heritage.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2347717}

It is the equivalent of a multinational three-star rank; some British lieutenant generals sometimes wear three-star insignia, in addition to their standard insignia, when on multinational operations.\n\nLieutenant general is a superior rank to major general, but subordinate to a (full) general. The rank has a NATO rank code of OF-8, equivalent to a vice-admiral in the Royal Navy and an air marshal in the Royal Air Force (RAF) and the air forces of many Commonwealth countries.\n\nThe rank insignia for both the Army and the Royal Marines is a crown over a crossed sabre and baton. Since the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, the St Edward's Crown, commonly known as the Queen's Crown, has been depicted. Before 1953, the Tudor Crown, commonly known as the King's Crown, was used.\n\nBritish Army usage\nOrdinarily, lieutenant general is the rank held by the officer in command of an entire battlefield corps. The General Officer Commanding NATO's Allied Rapid Reaction Corps is a British lieutenant general. Historically, I Corps and II Corps were commanded by British lieutenant generals. Additionally, three lieutenant general appointments also exist within the extant British Army's Headquarters. They are the Commander Field Army, the Commander Home Command and the Chief of Materiel (Land) in Defence Equipment and Support (double-hatted as the Quartermaster-General to the Forces).\n\nRoyal Marines usage\nAlthough the senior appointment in the Royal Marines, the Commandant General, has since 1996 held the lower rank of major general, prior to this date the Commandant General was a lieutenant general or full general. However, given that a few more senior positions in the British Armed Forces are open to officers from different services, Royal Marines officers can and do reach the rank of lieutenant general, being posted to Joint Forces or Ministry of Defence postings. Examples include Lieutenant-General Sir Robert Fry, Lieutenant-General Sir James Dutton and Lieutenant-General Sir David Capewell.\n\nRoyal Air Force usage\nFrom 1 April 1918 to 31 July 1919, the Royal Air Force maintained the rank of lieutenant general. It was superseded by the rank of air marshal on the following day. Although Sir David Henderson was an RAF lieutenant general, the then RAF Chief-of-Staff Sir Hugh Trenchard never held this rank. Additionally, the retired Royal Navy admiral John de Mestre Hutchison held an honorary RAF commission in the rank of lieutenant general.\n\nThe RAF lieutenant general rank insignia was similar to the naval rank insignia for a vice-admiral, with a broad band of gold being worn on the cuff with two narrower bands above it. Unlike the naval insignia, the RAF lieutenant general insignia did not have an executive curl.\n\nSee also\n\nBritish and U.S. military ranks compared\nBritish Army Other Ranks rank insignia\nBritish Army officer rank insignia\n\nReferences \n\nMilitary ranks of the British Army\nMilitary ranks of the Royal Marines\nFormer military ranks of the Royal Air Force", "machine_text": "Lieutenant-general is a rank in the British Army and other European armies. It is a senior officer rank denoted by the title \"Sir\" or \"Dame\" for a female incumbent. The rank is positioned above the rank of major general and below the rank of general. The Lieutenant-general rank came into existence during the 16th century when English commanders needed a higher rank for leading larger field armies. During the 17th century, the rank was largely replaced by the newly introduced rank of major-general. The rank of lieutenant-general was reintroduced during the late 18th century in response to the needs of larger colonial campaigns. Today, Lieutenant-generals occupy some of the most senior military positions in the British Army, including the role of Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff. A Lieutenant-general in the British Army is usually appointed through internal promotion from the rank of major-general, based on their experience and performance. However, a small number of individuals can gain the rank through Meritorious Service. Lieutenant-generals are typically responsible for the strategic planning and execution of military operations. They oversee and lead various divisions of the military, including infantry, transportation, intelligence, logistics, and medical services. In addition to their operational responsibilities, Lieutenant-generals also have several ceremonial duties. They represent the Army at various public events, including parades and royal engagements. Overall, the rank of Lieutenant-general is one of the most prominent in the British Army. Its holders are responsible for the leadership of the Army, and their decisions have far-reaching consequences for the security of the United Kingdom and its allies.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 3820095}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"William E. Boeing\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "William Edward Boeing (; October 1, 1881 \u2013 September 28, 1956) was an American aviation pioneer who founded the Pacific Airplane Company in 1916, which a year later was renamed to The Boeing Company, now the largest exporter in the United States by dollar value and among the largest aerospace manufacturers in the world. William Boeing's first design was the Boeing Model 1 (or B & W Seaplane), which first flew in June 1916, a month before the company was founded. He also helped create the United Aircraft and Transport Corporation (known as \"United Airlines\" today) in 1929 and served as its chairman. He received the Daniel Guggenheim Medal in 1934 and was posthumously inducted in to the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 1966, ten years after his death.\n\nEarly life\n\nWilliam Boeing was born in Detroit, Michigan, to Marie M. Ortmann, from Vienna, Austria, and Wilhelm B\u00f6ing (1846\u20131890) from Hohenlimburg, Germany. Wilhelm B\u00f6ing emigrated to the United States in 1868 and initially worked as a laborer. His move to America was disliked by his father and he received no financial support. He later made a fortune from North Woods timber lands and iron ore mineral rights on the Mesabi Range of Minnesota, north of Lake Superior.\n\nIn 1890, when William was eight, his father died of influenza and his mother soon remarried. He attended school in Vevey, Switzerland, and returned to the US for a year of prep school in Boston. He enrolled at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, dropping out in 1903 to go into the lumber business.\n\nCareer\n  He was successful in the venture, in part by shipping lumber to the East Coast via the then-new Panama Canal, generating funds that he would later apply to a very different business.\n\nWhile president of Greenwood Timber Company, Boeing, who had experimented with boat design, traveled to Seattle. During the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition in 1909, he saw a manned flying machine for the first time and became fascinated with aircraft. In 1910, at the Dominguez Flying Meet, Boeing asked every pilot foreign and domestic if he could go for an airplane ride and was repeatedly denied except for French aviator Louis Paulhan. Boeing waited and Paulhan finished the meet and left never giving Boeing his ride. Boeing took flying lessons at Glenn L. Martin Flying School in Los Angeles and purchased one of Martin's planes. Martin pilot James Floyd Smith traveled to Seattle to assemble Boeing's new Martin TA hydroaeroplane and continue to teach its owner to fly. Huge crates arrived by train and Smith assembled the plane in a tent hangar erected on the shore of Lake Union. Boeing's test pilot, Herb Munter, soon damaged the plane. When he was told by Martin that replacement parts would not be available for months, Boeing told his friend, Commander George Conrad Westervelt of the US Navy, \"We could build a better plane ourselves and build it faster.\" Westervelt agreed. They soon built and flew the B & W Seaplane, an amphibian biplane that had outstanding performance. Boeing decided to go into the aircraft business, using an old boat works on the Duwamish River near Seattle for his factory.\n\nFounding of Boeing Aircraft\nIn 1916, Boeing went into business with George Conrad Westervelt as \"B & W\" and founded Pacific Aero Products Co. The company's first plane was the Boeing Model 1 (B & W Seaplane). When America entered the First World War on April 8, 1917, Boeing changed the name to Boeing Airplane Company and obtained orders from the US Navy for 50 planes. At the end of the war, Boeing concentrated on commercial aircraft to service airmail contracts.\n\nInternational airmail attempt\nOn March 3, 1919, Willam Boeing partnered with Eddie Hubbard made the first delivery of international airmail to the United States. They flew a Boeing C-700 seaplane for the demonstration trip from Vancouver, British Columbia, to Seattle's Lake Union, carrying a bag of 60 letters from the Canadian post office for delivery in the U.S.\n\nBoeing family\nIn 1921, Boeing married Bertha Marie Potter Paschall (1891-1977). She had previously been married to Nathaniel Paschall, a real estate broker with whom she had two sons, Nathaniel \"Nat\" Paschall Jr. and Cranston Paschall. The couple had a son of their own, William E. Boeing Jr. (1922\u20132015). The stepsons went into aviation manufacturing as a career. Nat Paschall was a sales manager for competitor Douglas Aircraft, which later became McDonnell Douglas. Bill Jr. became a private pilot and industrial real estate developer.\n\nBertha Boeing was the daughter of Howard Cranston Potter and Alice Kershaw Potter. Through her father, she was a descendant of the founders of Alex. Brown & Sons merchant bankers Alexander Brown, James Brown, and Brown's son-in-law and partner Howard Potter; and through her mother, the granddaughter of Charles James Kershaw and Mary Leavenworth Kershaw (a descendant of Henry Leavenworth).\n\nThe name Boeing is anglicized from the German name B\u00f6ing, and had Welsh origins as a patronymic from Owen. The prefix and suffix were added later.\n\nBreakup of Boeing Group\n\nIn 1929, Boeing joined with Frederick Rentschler of Pratt & Whitney to form United Aircraft and Transport Corporation. The new grouping was a vertically integrated company with interests in all aspects of aviation, intending to serve all aviation markets. In a short time, it bought a host of small airlines, merging them with Boeing's pioneering airline under a holding company, United Air Lines.\n\nIn 1934, the United States government accused William Boeing of monopolistic practices. The same year, the Air Mail Act forced airplane companies to separate flight operations from development and manufacturing. William Boeing divested himself of ownership as his holding company, United Aircraft and Transport Corporation, broke into three separate entities:\n\n United Aircraft Corporation, holding the former eastern US manufacturing (later United Technologies Corporation)\n Boeing Airplane Company, with western US manufacturing, which later became The Boeing Company\n United Air Lines for flight operations\n\nHe began investing most of his time in his horses in 1937. Boeing Airplane Company, though a major manufacturer in a fragmented industry, did not become successful until the beginning of World War II.\n\nLater life\n\nBetween 1935 and 1944, William Boeing and his wife Bertha set aside a large tract of land north of the Seattle city limits for subdivision, including the future communities of Richmond Beach, Richmond Heights, Innis Arden, Blue Ridge, and Shoreview. The Boeings placed racially restrictive covenants on their land to enforce segregation, forbidding properties from being \"sold, conveyed, rented, or leased in whole or in part to any person not of the White or Caucasian race.\" Non-whites could only occupy a property on the land if they were employed as a domestic servant \"by a person of the White or Caucasian race.\"\n\nHe spent the remainder of his life in property development and thoroughbred horse breeding. Concerned about the possibility of World War II battles in the Pacific Northwest, he purchased a  farm in the countryside east of Seattle, which he dubbed \"Aldarra.\" The estate remained in the family until most of the land was developed into a golf course residential community in 2001. Several acres, however, remained in the family, including the Boeing's own and two smaller houses. His primary residence for most of his life, however, was a mansion in The Highlands community close to Seattle; the William E. Boeing House was later listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Boeing Creek running near this property bears his name.\n\nOn May 14, 1954, William Boeing and his wife Bertha went back to the Boeing Airplane Company to participate in the rollout ceremony for the Boeing 367-80 prototype.\n\nWilliam Boeing died on September 28, 1956, at the age of 74, three days before his 75th birthday. He was pronounced dead on arrival at the Seattle Yacht Club, having had a heart attack aboard his yacht, Taconite, in Puget Sound, Washington. His ashes were scattered off the coast of British Columbia, where he spent much of his time sailing.\n\nHe was posthumously inducted into the Aviation Hall of Fame in Dayton, Ohio, in 1966.\n\nIn 1984, Boeing was inducted into the International Air & Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air & Space Museum. The Museum of Flight, in Seattle holds the William E. Boeing Sr. Papers; an archival collection of Boeing's textual and photographic materials.\n\nSee also\nUnited States airmail service\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n Carl Cleveland, Boeing Trivia, (Seattle: CMC Books, 1989)\n Harold Mansfield, Vision: A Saga of the Sky (Duell, Sloan and Pearce, 1956)\n Robert Serling, Legend & Legacy: The Story of Boeing and Its People (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1992)\n\nExternal links\n\n1881 births\n1956 deaths\nAmerican aerospace businesspeople\nAmerican aviation businesspeople\nBoeing people\nAmerican company founders\nAmerican chairpersons of corporations\nAviation pioneers\nAircraft designers\nAmerican racehorse owners and breeders\nBusinesspeople in aviation\nBusinesspeople from Seattle\nChairmen of Boeing\nAmerican people of German descent\nBusinesspeople from Detroit\nYale School of Engineering & Applied Science alumni\n20th-century men\nAmerican people of Austrian descent\nNational Aviation Hall of Fame inductees\nPeople who died at sea\n20th-century American businesspeople", "machine_text": "William E.

Boeing's most significant contribution to aviation was the Boeing 247, an all-metal airliner. The Boeing 247 was faster, more reliable, and more comfortable than previous planes, and it revolutionized air travel. Boeing's company also designed military planes, including the B-17 Flying Fortress, which was crucial during World War II. Boeing was not just an aviation entrepreneur, but also a philanthropist. He was a major contributor to the University of Washington, and his foundation established the Museum of Flight in Seattle, which displays many of Boeing's planes. William E.

This enzyme plays a vital role in the citric acid cycle, also known as the Krebs cycle, which is a series of chemical reactions that occur in the mitochondria. The citric acid cycle is responsible for the breakdown of carbohydrates and fats and produces energy in the form of ATP. Malate dehydrogenase (NADP+) catalyzes the conversion of malate to oxaloacetate in the presence of NADP+. The enzyme does this by transferring electrons from malate to NADP+, which results in the formation of NADPH. NADPH is a coenzyme that serves as an electron donor in various metabolic processes. The conversion of malate to oxaloacetate is an essential step in the citric acid cycle, as oxaloacetate is required for the next step in the cycle. Malate dehydrogenase (NADP+) is an important enzyme in cellular metabolism, as it helps to regulate the levels of NADPH and malate in the cell. NADPH is required for a variety of cellular processes, including nucleic acid synthesis, fatty acid synthesis and cholesterol biosynthesis. Malate, on the other hand, is an intermediate in the citric acid cycle and can be used by the cell to produce energy. The structure of malate dehydrogenase (NADP+) is complex. It is a homodimeric enzyme, meaning that it is made up of two identical subunits. Each subunit has a molecular weight of approximately 35 kDa. The enzyme contains a binding site for NADP+ and a catalytic site for malate. In conclusion, Malate dehydrogenase (NADP+) is a crucial enzyme in the citric acid cycle, which is responsible for energy production in living organisms.

The election saw a record 1,374 candidates representing 16 parties and 127 Independents competing for 127 lower house seats and 32 in the upper house. The Australian Labor Party (ALP) was widely expected to win the election, but internal tensions and divisions within its ranks, especially over economic policies, split it down the middle. Many anti-Labor voters, disillusioned with the party, shifted their support to the Coalition. The Liberal-National Coalition nominated 153 candidates from both parties; the Liberal Party fielded 97 candidates, while the National Party contested 56. The Coalition\u2019s campaign focused on its success in steering Australia through uncertain economic times and its promises to further develop the economy by boosting investments in mining, farming, and manufacturing. The ALP fielded 131 candidates, mostly coming from the right and left factions of the party. The key issues the party campaigned on included improving the standard of living for Australians, creating jobs, and boosting social welfare programs such as the introduction of universal health care. Other political parties that contested the 1975 Federal Election were the Australian Democrats, the Australian Labor Party (Anti-Communist), the Australian National Socialist Party, the Australia Party, Communist Party of Australia, and the Liberal Movement, among others. The election resulted in a landslide victory for the Coalition who won 91 seats in the lower house, the largest in Australian history, while the ALP won just 36. The Coalition also won five Senate seats, giving them a majority in the upper house. Fraser was sworn in as Prime Minister on March 11, 1976, succeeding Gough Whitlam. In conclusion, the 1975 Federal Election was one of the most contested and divisive elections in Australian history. The large number of candidates and political parties vying for seats reflected a country in transition and a growing disillusionment with traditional political ideology.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 21016163}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Polyarchy\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "In political science, the term polyarchy ( \"many\", arkhe \"rule\") was used by Robert A. Dahl to describe a form of government in which power is invested in multiple people. It takes the form of neither a dictatorship nor a democracy. This form of government was first implemented in the United States and France and gradually adopted by other countries. According to Dahl, the fundamental democratic principle is \"the continuing responsiveness of the government to the preferences of its citizens, considered as political equals\" with unimpaired opportunities. A polyarchy is a state that has certain procedures that are necessary conditions for following the democratic principle.\n\nIn semblance, the word \"polycracy\" describes the same form of government, although from a slightly different premise: a polycracy is a state ruled by more than one person, as opposed to a monocracy. The word derives from Greek poly (\"many\") and kratos (\"rule\" or \"strength\").\n\nDefinitions \nDahl's original theory of polyarchal democracy is in his 1956 book A Preface to Democratic Theory. His theory evolved over the decades, and the description in later writings is somewhat different.\n\nDahl argues that \"democracy\" is an ideal type that no country has ever achieved. For Dahl, democracy is a system that is \"completely responsive to all its citizens\", and the closest to the democratic ideal any country can come is polyarchy.\n\nA Preface to Democratic Theory \nIn the book, Dahl gives eight conditions that measure the extent to which majority rule is in effect in an organization. These are (p. 84):\n\nEvery member of the organization performs the acts we assume to constitute an expression of preference among the scheduled alternatives, e.g., voting.\nIn tabulating these expressions (votes), the weight assigned to each individual is identical.\nThe alternative with the greatest number of votes is declared the winning choice.\nAny member who perceives a set of alternatives, at least one of which he regards as preferable to any of the alternatives presently scheduled, can insert his preferred alternative(s) among those scheduled for voting.\nAll individuals possess identical information about the alternatives.\nAlternatives (leaders or policies) with the greatest number of votes displace any alternatives (leaders or policies) with fewer votes.\nThe orders of elected officials are executed.\nEither all interelection decisions are subordinate or executory to those arrived at during the election stage, i.e., elections are in a sense controlling; or new decisions during the interelection period are governed by the preceding seven conditions, operating, however, under rather different institutional circumstances; or both.\n\nDahl hypothesized that each of these conditions can be quantified, and suggested the term \"polyarchy\" to describe an organization that scores high on the scales for all the eight conditions.\n\nDahl viewed polyarchy as a system that manages to supply a high level of inclusiveness and a high level of liberalization to its citizens.\n\nDemocracy and its critics \nIn his 1989 book Democracy and Its Critics, Dahl gives the following characteristics of a polyarchy (p. 233):\n\nControl over governmental decisions about policy is constitutionally vested in elected officials.\nElected officials are chosen and peacefully removed in relatively frequent, fair and free elections in which coercion is quite limited.\nPractically all adults have the right to vote in these elections.\nMost adults also have the right to run for the public offices for which candidates run in these elections.\nCitizens have an effectively enforced right to freedom of expression, particularly political expression, including criticism of the officials, the conduct of the government, the prevailing political, economic, and social system, and the dominant ideology.\nThey also have access to alternative sources of information that are not monopolized by the government or any other single group.\nFinally, they have an effectively enforced right to form and join autonomous associations, including political associations, such as political parties and interest groups, that attempt to influence the government by competing in elections and by other peaceful means.\n\nCharacteristics \nPolyarchy and its procedures may be insufficient for achieving full democracy. For example, poor people may be unable to participate in the political process. Some authors see polyarchy as a form of government that is not intended for greater social justice or cultural realization or to allow the repressed to politically participate.\n\nAccording to William I. Robinson, it is a system where a small group actually rules on behalf of capital, and the majority\u2019s decision-making is confined to choosing among a select number of elites within tightly controlled elective processes. It is a form of consensual domination made possible by the structural domination of the global capital, which allows concentration of political power. Robert A. Dahl and Charles E. Lindblom noted that political bargaining is an essential feature of polyarchy, particularly in the US.\n\nMoreover, a perceived polyarchy\u2014such as the United States\u2014may bar a substantial number of its citizens from participating in its electoral process. For example, more than four million U.S. citizens residing in the U.S. territories, such as Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands, are excluded from participating in the election of any voting member of Congress, the political body that holds ultimate sovereignty over them. Robinson argues that they are effectively taxed without lawful representation (although these territories' status is a matter of popular consensus in individual cases).\n\nIn Preface to Democratic Theory (1956), Dahl argues that an increase in citizen political involvement may not always be beneficial for polyarchy. An increase in the political participation of members of less educated classes, for example, could reduce the support for the basic norms of polyarchy, because members of those classes are more predisposed to be authoritarian-minded.\n\nIn a discussion of contemporary British foreign policy, Mark Curtis writes, \"Polyarchy is generally what British leaders mean when they speak of promoting 'democracy' abroad. This is a system in which a small group actually rules and mass participation is confined to choosing leaders in elections managed by competing elites.\"\n\nIt is also being promoted by the transnational elites in the South as a different form from the authoritarianism and dictatorship to the North as a part of democracy promotion. Robinson argues that this is to cultivate transnational elites who will open up their countries following the transnational agenda of neoliberalism, whereby transnational capital mobility and globalized circuits of production and distribution are established. For example, it was promoted to Nicaragua, Chile, Haiti, the Philippines, South Africa and the former Soviet Bloc countries.\n\nSee also \n\n Civil society\n Governance\n State/Space theory\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n \n \n  Full text.\n \n \n \n  \n  Pdf.\n \n \n\nComparative politics\nDemocracy\nPolitical science theories\nDictatorship\nPower sharing", "machine_text": "Polyarchy is the term used to describe a political system in which power is held by multiple individuals or groups. This term was first coined by the political scientist Robert Dahl in the 1970s, and it has since become an important concept in the study of comparative politics, particularly in the field of democratic theory. A polyarchy is characterized by a combination of democratic and non-democratic elements. On one hand, there is typically a high degree of political pluralism, meaning that there are multiple political parties, interest groups, and civil society organizations that are active and relatively free to express their views and influence policy decisions. At the same time, however, there may be certain institutional or social barriers that prevent certain groups or individuals from fully participating in the political process, such as discriminatory election laws or deep-seated social prejudices. Despite these limitations, polyarchies are often seen as preferable to other types of political systems, such as authoritarian regimes or one-party states, because they offer at least some measure of political freedom and accountability. Polyarchies can also serve as a useful stepping stone to a more fully-formed democracy, particularly in countries with a history of authoritarianism or instability. Some scholars have raised concerns about the limitations of polyarchies, arguing that they may not go far enough in guaranteeing political freedom and equality for all citizens. Others have suggested that the concept of polyarchy may be too broad and imprecise to provide a clear roadmap for democratic reform. Nonetheless, for many political scientists and advocates of democratic governance, the concept of polyarchy remains a valuable tool for understanding and promoting democratic principles and practices around the world.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1081047}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"William Cullen Bryant\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "William Cullen Bryant (November 3, 1794 \u2013 June 12, 1878) was an American romantic poet, journalist, and long-time editor of the New York Evening Post. Born in Massachusetts, he started his career as a lawyer but showed an interest in poetry early in his life. He soon relocated to New York and took up work as an editor at various newspapers. He became one of the most significant poets in early literary America and has been grouped among the fireside poets for his accessible, popular poetry.\n\nBiography\n\nYouth and education\nBryant was born on November 3, 1794, in a log cabin near Cummington, Massachusetts; the home of his birth is today marked with a plaque. He was the second son of Peter Bryant (b. Aug. 12, 1767, d. Mar. 20, 1820), a doctor and later a state legislator, and Sarah Snell (b. Dec. 4, 1768, d. May 6, 1847). The genealogy of his mother traces back to passengers on the Mayflower: John Alden (b. 1599, d. 1687), his wife Priscilla Mullins and her parents William and Alice Mullins. The story of the romance between John and Priscilla is the subject of a famous narrative poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow The Courtship of Miles Standish.\n\nHe was also the nephew of Charity Bryant, a Vermont seamstress who is the subject of Rachel Hope Cleves's 2014 book Charity and Sylvia: A Same-Sex Marriage in Early America. William Cullen Bryant described their relationship: \"If I were permitted to draw the veil of private life, I would briefly give you the singular, and to me interesting, story of two maiden ladies who dwell in this valley. I would tell you how, in their youthful days, they took each other as companions for life, and how this union, no less sacred to them than the tie of marriage, has subsisted, in uninterrupted harmony, for more than forty years.\" Charity and Sylvia Drake are buried together at Weybridge Hill Cemetery, Weybridge, Vermont.\n\nBryant and his family moved to a new home when he was two years old. The William Cullen Bryant Homestead, his boyhood home, is now a museum. After just one year at Williams College (he entered with sophomore standing), he hoped to transfer to Yale, but a talk with his father led to the realization that family finances would not support it. His father counseled a legal career as his best available choice, and the disappointed poet began to study law in Worthington and Bridgewater in Massachusetts. He was admitted to the bar in 1815 and began practicing law in nearby Plainfield, walking the seven miles from Cummington every day. On one of these walks, in December 1815, he noticed a single bird flying on the horizon; the sight moved him enough to write \"To a Waterfowl\".\n\nBryant developed an interest in poetry early in life. Under his father's tutelage, he emulated Alexander Pope and other Neo-Classic British poets. \"The Embargo\", a savage attack on President Thomas Jefferson published in 1808, reflected Dr. Bryant's Federalist political views. The first edition quickly sold out\u2014partly because of publicity attached to the poet's young age. A second, expanded edition included Bryant's translation of classical verse. During his collegiate studies and his reading for the law, he wrote little poetry, but encounters with the Graveyard Poets and then Wordsworth regenerated his passion for \"the witchery of song.\"\n\nEarly poetry\n\n\"Thanatopsis\" is Bryant's most famous poem, which Bryant may have been working on as early as 1811.  In 1817 his father took some pages of verse from his son's desk, and at the invitation of Willard Phillips, an editor of the North American Review who had previously been tutored in the classics by Dr. Bryant, he submitted them along with his own work. The editor of the Review, Edward Tyrrel Channing, read the poem to associate editor Richard Henry Dana Sr., who immediately exclaimed, \"That was never written on this side of the water!\" Someone at the North American joined two of the son's discrete fragments, gave the result the Greek-derived title Thanatopsis (\"meditation on death\"), mistakenly attributed it to the father, and published it. After clarification of the authorship, the son's poems began appearing with some regularity in the Review. A portion of Bryant\u2019s poem, Thanatopsis, is at the base of the William Cullen Bryant Memorial behind the New York Public Library which was dedicated in 1911. \"To a Waterfowl\", published in 1821, was the most popular.\n\nOn January 11, 1821, Bryant, still striving to build a legal career, married Frances Fairchild. Soon after, having received an invitation to address the Harvard University Phi Beta Kappa Society at the school's August commencement, Bryant spent months working on \"The Ages\", a panorama in verse of the history of civilization, culminating in the establishment of the United States. As it would in all collections he subsequently issued, \"The Ages\" led the volume, also entitled Poems, which he arranged to publish on the same trip to Cambridge. For that book, he added sets of lines at the beginning and end of \"Thanatopsis\" that changed the poem. His career as a poet was now established, though recognition as America's leading poet waited until 1832, when an expanded Poems was published in the U.S. and, with the assistance of Washington Irving, in Britain.\n\nEditorial work\nFrom 1816 to 1825, Bryant depended on his law practice in Great Barrington, Massachusetts to sustain his family financially, but the strain of dealing with unsophisticated neighbors pushed him to trade his unrewarding profession for New York City and the promise of a literary career. With the encouragement of a distinguished and well-connected literary family, the Sedgwicks, he quickly gained a foothold in New York City's vibrant cultural life. His first employment, in 1825, was as editor of the New-York Review, which within the next year merged with the United States Review and Literary Gazette. Although literary historians have neglected his fiction, Bryant's stories over the seven-year period from his time with the Review to the publication of Tales of Glauber Spa in 1832 show a variety of strategies, making him the most inventive of practitioners of the genre during this early stage of its evolution.\n\nIn the throes of the failing struggle to raise subscriptions, he accepted part-time duties with the New-York Evening Post under William Coleman; then, partly because of Coleman's ill health, traceable to the consequences of a duel and then a stroke, Bryant's responsibilities expanded rapidly. From assistant editor he rose to editor-in-chief and co-owner of the newspaper that had been founded by Alexander Hamilton. Over the next half century, the Post would become the most respected paper in the city and, from the election of Andrew Jackson, the major platform in the Northeast for the Democratic Party and subsequently of the Free Soil and Republican Parties. In the process, the Evening-Post also became the pillar of a substantial fortune. Despite his Federalist beginnings, Bryant had shifted to being one of the most liberal voices of the century. An early supporter of organized labor, with his 1836 editorials asserting the right of workmen to strike, Bryant also defended religious minorities and immigrants, and promoted the abolition of slavery. He \"threw himself into the foreground of the battle for human rights\" and did not cease speaking out against the corrupting influence of certain bankers in spite of their efforts to break down the paper. According to newspaper historian Frank Luther Mott, Bryant was \"a great liberal seldom done justice by modern writers\". \n\nHe was elected an Associate Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1855.\n\nDespite his once staunch opposition to Thomas Jefferson and his party, Bryant became one of the key supporters in the Northeast of that same party under Jackson. Bryant's views, always progressive though not quite populist, in course led him to join the Free Soilers, and when the Free Soil Party became a core of the new Republican Party in 1856, Bryant vigorously campaigned for John Fr\u00e9mont. That exertion enhanced his standing in party councils, and in 1860, he was one of the prime Eastern exponents of Abraham Lincoln, whom he introduced at Cooper Union. (That \"Cooper Union speech\" lifted Lincoln to the nomination, and then the presidency.) In the 1860 presidential election, he elected Lincoln and Hannibal Hamlin as a presidential elector.\n\nLater years\nBryant edited the very successful  Picturesque America, which was published between 1872 and 1874. This two-volume set was lavishly illustrated and described scenic places in the United States and Canada. In his last decade, Bryant shifted from writing his own poetry to a blank verse translation of Homer's works. He assiduously worked on the Iliad and The Odyssey from 1871 to 1874. He is also remembered as one of the principal authorities on homeopathy and as a hymnist for the Unitarian Church, both legacies of his father's influence on him.\n\nIn 1843, Bryant bought a house he christened Cedarmere (for the cedar trees around the pond, or \"mere\") in Roslyn Harbor, on Long Island.  In 1865, he bought the farmhouse in Cummington, where he'd grown up, and summered there annually until his death.  He made substantial improvements to the houses at both properties. He was known for his attention to trees on his land, and later in life he expressed concerns that deforestation in the United States would prove disastrous for American agriculture.\n\nBryant died in 1878 of complications from an accidental fall suffered after participating in a Central Park ceremony to honor Italian patriot Giuseppe Mazzini. He is buried at Roslyn Cemetery in Roslyn, New York.\n\nCritical response\n\nBryant became one of the most significant poets in early American literary history. He is typically included among the group of poets referred to as the fireside poets, along with Longfellow, John Greenleaf Whittier, James Russell Lowell, and Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. They are considered to be among the first American poets whose popularity rivaled that of British poets, both at home and abroad and are so named because their writing was a source of entertainment for families gathered around the fire at home. Bryant's poetry has been described as being \"of a thoughtful, meditative character, and makes but slight appeal to the mass of readers.\"\n\nEdgar Allan Poe praised Bryant and specifically the poem \"June\" in his essay \"The Poetic Principle\":\nThe rhythmical flow, here, is even voluptuous\u2014nothing could be more melodious. The poem has always affected me in a remarkable manner. The intense melancholy which seems to well up, perforce, to the surface of all the poet's cheerful sayings about his grave, we find thrilling us to the soul\u2014while there is the truest poetic elevation in the thrill. The impression left is one of a pleasurable sadness.\n\nEditor and children's writer Mary Mapes Dodge wrote that Bryant's poems \"have wrought vast and far-reaching good in the world.\" She predicted, \"You will admire more and more, as you grow older, the noble poems of this great and good man.\" Poet and literary critic Thomas Holley Chivers said that the \"only thing [Bryant] ever wrote that may be called Poetry is 'Thanatopsis', which he stole line for line from the Spanish. The fact is, that he never did anything but steal\u2014as nothing he ever wrote is original.\"\n\nBryant's poetry is tender and graceful, pervaded by a contemplative melancholy, and a love of solitude and the silence of the woods. Though he was brought up to admire Pope, and in his early youth imitated him, he was one of the first American poets to throw off his influence. Bryant had an interest in science and in geology especially. Thomas Cole was a friend and both, at different times, considered the \"geological structure\" of Volterra in Italy.  He met Charles Lyell in England in 1845.\n\nAs a writer, Bryant was an early advocate of American literary nationalism, and his own poetry focusing on nature as a metaphor for truth established a central pattern in the American literary tradition.\n\nSome however, argue that a reassessment is long overdue. It finds great merit in a couple of short stories Bryant wrote while trying to build interest in periodicals he edited. More importantly, it perceives a poet of great technical sophistication who was a progenitor of Walt Whitman, to whom he was a mentor.\n\nLegacy\n\nAlthough born in and with deep family ties in New England, Bryant for most of his lifetime was thoroughly a New Yorker\u2014and a very dedicated one at that. He was a major force behind the idea that became Central Park, as well as a leading proponent of creating the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He was one of a group of founders of New York Medical College. He had close affinities with the Hudson River School of art and was an intimate friend of Thomas Cole. A statue of William Cullen Bryant was one of the statues of \u201cEminent Americans\u201d that surrounded the Palace of Fine Arts at the 1915 Panama Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco, California. The William Cullen Bryant Memorial, in Bryant Park, includes a bronze of the same work by sculptor Herbert Adams. Bryant Park, behind the New York Public Library, in New York bears his name. In 1884, New York City's Reservoir Square, at the intersection of 42nd Street and Sixth Avenue, was renamed Bryant Park, and later Herbert Adam's statue was placed, in Bryant's honor. \n\nJust outside New York City, the Long Island village of Roslyn Harbor, New York is home to the William Cullen Bryant Preserve, located on land he formerly owned next to what is now the Nassau County Museum of Art. Bryant is also the namesake of the Bryant Library in Roslyn, New York, located near his Cedarmere Estate.\n\nOther locations named after Bryant include: Bryant, a neighborhood in Seattle; Bryant Woods, one of the four original villages in Columbia, Maryland; Cullen Bryant Park in Toronto, Ontario; the Bryant Free Library in Cummington, Massachusetts; and the Bryant House at Williams College.\n\nSeveral schools are named after Bryant, including William Cullen Bryant High School in Long Island City, New York, and elementary schools in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Long Beach, California, Cleveland, Ohio, and Great Barrington, Massachusetts. A rural schoolhouse in Sanford, Maine was also named for Bryant.\n\nMartin Luther King Jr. quoted Bryant in his speech \"Give Us the Ballot\", when he said, \"there is something in this universe which justifies William Cullen Bryant in saying: 'Truth crushed to earth will rise again.\n\nSee also\nCullen, Saskatchewan and Bryant, Saskatchewan\n\nNotes\n\nReferencesWilliam Cullen Bryant: An American Voice by Frank Gado ()William Cullen Bryant by Charles H.

Born in Cummington, Massachusetts, Bryant began writing poetry at an early age and had published his first collection, \"The Embargo\" by the time he was seventeen. He later went on to attend Williams College, but left after just one year to study law. However, he never practiced law and instead focused on writing. Bryant's literary career took off when he moved to New York City in 1825 and became the editor of the \"New York Evening Post,\" a position he held for fifty years. During this time, he also published several collections of poetry, including \"Poems\" (1821) and \"The Ages\" (1837). Bryant was known for his romantic poetry, often focusing on nature and the beauty of the world. His most famous poem is arguably \"Thanatopsis,\" which explores themes of death and the afterlife. He also wrote several political and social pieces, including his famous editorial condemning the Fugitive Slave Act in 1854. Bryant was a prominent figure in the American cultural scene, an active member of the Whig Party, and a well-respected public figure. He was also a founding member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. William Cullen Bryant died in New York City in 1878 at the age of 83. He left a lasting impact on American literature with his romantic poetry and his dedication to social and political reform.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 232024}

The actual amount of the scholarship is determined based upon state funding and is sometimes less than the maximum amount.  From June 2004 to July 2005, 8390 students were enrolled in the Bright Flight program, which totaled over $15 million in state expenditures.\n\nQualifications and renewal\nTo qualify for the Bright Flight maximum award of $3000 per year, a student must be in the top 3% of his or her statewide high school class as determined by normalized tests, the ACT and SAT composite scores. To date and for several years, a score of 31 or above on the ACT or an SAT-equivalent score qualifies, but the score can change each year.  A composite score of 31 will be needed to qualify for the college freshmen in the 2020\u20132021 school year.\nThe law also qualifies students in the 4th and 5th percentiles to receive a $1000 per year maximum scholarship; however, the Missouri Legislature has not funded this award in recent years, and these students have received no actual financial award.  An ACT composite score of 30 (or above) qualified for the 4th and 5th percentile for college freshmen in the 2020\u20132021 school year and recent years.\nTo continue receiving the scholarship, students must maintain at least a 2.5 GPA in college and maintain full-time student status to renew the scholarship, which can be renewed for up to five years.\nStudents must not be pursuing a degree in theology or divinity.  \nBright Flight students must attend school continuously.  They cannot cease attending school, except to work for a non-profit organization, hold a government job, or serve in the armed services. Academic interruption must not exceed 27 months.\n\nHistory\nAppropriated by the Missouri General Assembly in 1986, students initially received a statutory maximum of $2000 per year.  Many students and higher education officials have observed that tuition expenses at the University of Missouri, for example, were below $2000 in 1987 and thus were fully covered by Bright Flight at its introduction. In 2017, following a period of increases in tuition expenses that easily outpaced inflation, Bright Flight covered only a fraction of the more than $11,000 a typical student spent on tuition at the University of Missouri.\n\nRecent developments\n\nOn August 12, 2010, state budget cuts reduced the amount from $2000/year to $1500/year for that year.\n\nOn November 25, 2013, Missouri Governor Jay Nixon announced at a college preparatory school in Kansas City, Missouri that he included a proposal in Missouri's 2015 budget that would offer an option to receive up to $5,000 extra per year if recipients stayed in Missouri after finishing college for the number of years they received Bright Flight.\n\nOn July 21, 2020, Universities in Missouri received an email from the Missouri Department of Higher Education and Workforce Development that noted, \u201cThe General Assembly appropriated $20,176,666 in Bright Flight funds for state fiscal year 2021.  However, based on current economic conditions the Governor has restricted almost $6.5 million of those funds, significantly reducing the amount of funds available to the program.  As a result, the estimated Bright Flight award amounts have been reduced from $3,000 to $1,800 to ensure expenditures do not exceed the available funds.  We regret the impact this unavoidable reduction will have on students and we will consider a mid-year increase to award amounts if the restricted funds are released. Final award amounts for both programs will be announced in August.\u201d  This email reflected the budget cuts indicated by the Governor in the previous month.\n\nReferences  \n\nEducation in Missouri\nScholarships in the United States\nPublic education in Missouri\nGovernment scholarships", "machine_text": "Bright Flight is a scholarship program in the state of Missouri which awards merit-based scholarships to high-achieving high school graduates who plan to attend college within the state. The program was established in 1986 by the Missouri General Assembly, with the aim of encouraging talented students to remain in the state for higher education and contribute to its economic development. To qualify for the Bright Flight scholarship, a high school graduate must achieve a minimum score of 31 on the ACT (or an equivalent score on the SAT), and be a citizen or permanent resident of Missouri. The scholarship is renewable for up to five years of full-time undergraduate study at any Missouri public or private college or university, provided the student maintains a GPA of at least 2.5 and remains enrolled in a program leading to a degree. The amount of the scholarship varies each year, depending on the availability of funding and the number of eligible students. In the past, the scholarship has covered up to 100% of tuition and fees for public institution and up to 75% of tuition and fees for private institution. Bright Flight has been highly successful in retaining top talent within Missouri. Since its inception, the scholarship has awarded over $751 million in funding to more than 162,000 Missouri students. The program has helped increase the number of students attending in-state colleges and universities and has contributed to the state's knowledge-based economic growth. In addition to the Bright Flight program, Missouri also offers several other merit-based scholarship programs, including Access Missouri, A+ Scholarship Program and the Missouri Scholarship and Loan Foundation program.

It was produced by Julian Wintle and edited by Gordon Hales and Geoffrey Muller, with cinematography by Eric Cross and music by Hubert Clifford.  \n\nThe film won the Golden Leopard award at the 1952 Locarno International Film Festival.\n\nPlot\nRobbie (Jon Whiteley), an orphaned 6-year-old boy, has been placed with uncaring and harsh adoptive parents in London.  Having accidentally set a small fire in the house, he fears he will receive severe punishment as he has in the past for misdemeanours, so flees into the London streets. Here, he literally runs into Chris Lloyd (Dirk Bogarde) who is himself on the run as he has, in the heat of passion, just killed  his wife's employer, whom Lloyd had discovered, was having an affair with his wife. \nRobbie attaches himself to Lloyd, who repeatedly tries to rid himself of the boy, albeit as caringly as possible. Lloyd decides, hesitantly, to use the boy to retrieve some much needed cash from his apartment. Thereafter, Lloyd feels compelled to bring Robbie along with him. The film follows the pair as they travel northwards towards Scotland, with the police in somewhat baffled pursuit, and charts the developing relationship between the two. Initially Lloyd regards Robbie dismissively, as an unwanted inconvenience, while Robbie is wary and suspicious of Lloyd.  As their journey progresses, however, the pair gradually develop a strong bond of friendship, trust and common cause. Both feel they have 'burned their bridges' and now have nothing to lose.  They finally reach a small Scottish fishing port, where Lloyd steals a boat and sets sail for Ireland.

He was called in for a screen test and was cast.\n\nMuch of the film was shot on location, with three main areas being used.  \nThe early London exterior scenes were shot in the Pimlico/Victoria area, which at the time still had derelict corners showing evidence of wartime damage.\nThe location chosen for the scenes set in the English Midlands was the area in and around Stoke-on-Trent, with its distinctive industrial skyline of factory chimneys and giant pottery kilns.  The railway sequence in this section was shot on the now-defunct Potteries Loop Line, and this scene has come to be regarded as historically significant by British railway enthusiasts as it provides a very rare filmic depiction of the long-gone line in operation. \nScottish filming took place in the vicinity of Portpatrick in Wigtownshire and featured the fishing boat 'Mizpah' BA-11 built by Noble of Girvan (1949).\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n \n Discussion of filming locations of Hunted @ britmovie.net\n\n1952 films\n1952 crime drama films\nBritish films\nBritish black-and-white films\nBritish buddy films\nBritish crime drama films\nBritish chase films\nEnglish-language films\nFilms directed by Charles Crichton\nFilms set in England\nFilms set in Scotland\nFilms shot at Pinewood Studios\nGolden Leopard winners\nFilms set in London\nFilms with screenplays by Jack Whittingham", "machine_text": "Hunted is a 1952 British crime film directed by Charles Crichton and starring Dirk Bogarde, Jon Whiteley, and Elizabeth Sellars.

Bennett, his staff, the library, departments of agricultural school and other administrative offices. At the time it was built, it was one of the few structures west of Washington Street, not far from agricultural fields, experimental plots, stockyards, chicken coops and barns. Located near the site of the old brick College Barn. In 1926 the construction of Whitehurst Hall was the largest building project attempted at the college.\n\nConstruction\nThe groundbreaking for construction of Whitehurst Hall began in September 1925. Scaffolding for the walls and structural work was installed in early November, and the crews began erecting the reinforced concrete and steel structure. Whitehurst stands three stories tall with reinforced concrete floors, a flat roof and brick walls. There were 240 windows and steam lines running from the college power plant about 100 yards east provided heat. The outside dimensions of Whitehurst Hall were 262 by 80 feet, with roughly 17,500 square feet of floor space on each of the facility's three floors. The total area in the building surpassed 52,000 square feet. A basement, used mostly for utility connections and equipment, was located beneath the structure. Three doors were located at the center of the south face, which would be considered the front of the building, and the other entrances were at the northeast and northwest corners of the main building where it attached to the modified wings. Open stairwells from the first to third floors were situated near the doors on the north side of the structure. Total cost of construction reached over $250,000.\n\nRenovations\nRenovations to Whitehurst Hall were made in 1936, including the addition of the fourth floor, after damage to the building occurred and repairs were already necessary. Once additional building renovations were approved following the damage, including the addition of the new fourth floor, the renovation project total reached $75,000 (about $1.25 million in 2013).\n\nSignificant Event\nOn Friday the 13th, 1936 there was an explosion in a 3\u00bd-square-foot tunnel below the 6 inch concrete floor, which ran inside foundation walls and around the building. Natural gas, which leaked into the tunnel system, was ignited after an accidental spark was introduced during routine maintenance for a clogged drain. The first damage estimate was for $5,500 (equivalent to about $91,500 in 2013) to fix floors, replace windows, install new ventilators and gas lines, and repair and replace furniture.\n\nPresent\nIn 2015, Whitehurst Hall is an administrative building, continuing to host the President's office, in addition to other administrative offices.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nOklahoma State History Pin\nThe Centennial Histories series -- OSU Library\n\nOklahoma State University\nBuildings and structures in Stillwater, Oklahoma", "machine_text": "Whitehurst Hall is a residence hall located on the campus of Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Virginia.

This technique is employed extensively in research studies on emotion, communication, and social interaction, as well as in fields such as psychology, psychiatry, anthropology, and computer science. The system was developed by Paul Ekman and Wallace V. Friesen in the 1970s, and it has undergone several iterations and modifications since then. FACS is based on the idea that facial expressions are a combination of individual muscle movements, known as action units (AUs), which can be reliably identified and quantified. There are currently 46 AUs defined in FACS, each assigned a unique code and description. These AUs are further grouped into categories based on their function, such as those related to eyebrow movement, eye narrowing, or lip movement. To use FACS, trained observers examine a video record of a person's face and identify which AUs are present and their intensity by means of a coding system. The movements are then scored to create a \"facial action score,\" which is a quantitative measure of the intensity and type of facial expressions being displayed. One application of FACS has been in the development of automated facial recognition systems, which can identify and classify facial expressions in real time. This has enabled the creation of devices such as security cameras or emotion-reading software used in gaming, market research, and mental health diagnosis. FACS has proven to be an invaluable tool for studying emotional behavior and communication in humans, with widespread applications in research and clinical settings. However, because FACS coding requires extensive training and practice to become proficient, its use is often limited to specialized settings, and alternative techniques, such as the Behavioral Coding System, are sometimes used as a more accessible and practical alternative.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1476716}

Torres' work is characterized by bold brushstrokes, vibrant colors, and a sense of movement. His paintings often feature abstract shapes and forms that seem to dance across the canvas. He cites the work of artists like Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline, and Joan Mir\u00f3 as influences on his own style. Throughout his career, Torres has exhibited his work in galleries and museums across the United States and Puerto Rico. His work has been featured in solo and group exhibitions, and he has also been commissioned to create murals and public art installations.
