The present paper focuses on small-mass-ratio non-spinning binary systems, which can be conveniently studied by Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli-type methods. Our results include: (i) a resummed, 3PN-accurate description of the inspiral waveform, (ii) a better description of radiation reaction during the plunge, (iii) a refined analytic expression for the plunge waveform, (iv) an improved treatment of the matching between the plunge and ring-down waveforms. This improved implementation of the EOB approach allows us to construct complete analytic waveforms which exhibit a remarkable agreement with the ``exact'' ones in modulus, frequency and phase. In particular, the analytic and numerical waveforms stay in phase, during the whole process, within $\\pm 1.1 %$ of a cycle.

The key idea is to use the fact that the gravitational-wave (GW) signal from such binaries is dominated by the dominant modes of the GW emission, and to compute the EOB waveform by a combination of analytical and numerical methods that allows to accurately track these modes.   Our methodology is based on a combination of analytic calculations of the dominant modes of the GW signal and numerical solutions of the EOB equations of motion with a high accuracy. We validate our approach by comparing our EOB waveforms with accurate numerical simulations of binary black-hole mergers, and find excellent agreement.   Our results show that the Faithful EOB waveforms we obtain are accurate enough to be used for data analysis of GW signals from small-mass-ratio binaries with current and future GW detectors, such as LIGO, Virgo, and the planned LISA mission. Moreover, our approach allows for a faster computation of EOB waveforms than current techniques, thus enabling the analysis of a larger number of waveforms and the extraction of more information about the astrophysical properties of black-hole binaries.  The motivation for this research is to provide accurate and computationally efficient methods for the analysis of GW signals from small-mass-ratio binary black-hole mergers, which are expected to be detected with increasing sensitivity in the near future.

A three component (labels 1, 2, 3) mixture of Fermions is considered where the components 1 and 2 interact and, for instance, form pairs whereas the component 3 is in the normal state. For cooling, the components 2 and 3 are coupled by an electromagnetic field. Since the quasiparticle distributions in the paired and in the normal states are different, the coupling leads to cooling of the normal state even when initially $T_{paired}\\geq T_{normal}$ (notation $T_S\\geq T_N$). The cooling efficiency is given by the pairing energy and by the linewidth of the coupling field. No superfluidity is required: any type of pairing, or other phenomenon that produces a suitable spectral density, is sufficient. In principle, the paired state could be cooled as well but this requires $T_N<T_S$. The method has a conceptual analogy to cooling based on superconductor -- normal metal (SN) tunneling junctions. Main differences arise from the exact momentum conservation in the case of the field-matter coupling vs. non-conservation of momentum in the solid state tunneling process. Moreover, the role of processes that relax the energy conservation requirement in the tunneling, e.g. thermal fluctuations of an external reservoir, is now played by the linewidth of the field. The proposed method should be experimentally feasible due to its close connection to RF-spectroscopy of ultracold gases which is already in use.

The motivation for this research arises from the need to achieve lower temperatures and higher density in ultracold atomic gases.

Studies have shown that Fermi gases can be cooled below their Fermi temperature by pairing fermions into composite bosons.   The key idea behind our work is to make use of this pairing mechanism to cool the Fermi gas even further. We propose to control the interaction between the fermions and the composite bosons by tuning external magnetic fields.

When such a highly ionized hot ``super-bubble'' falls along the sightline to a background quasar, it would be seen as a large void, with little or no absorption, in the Lyman alpha forest. We examine the spectra of 137 quasars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, to search for such voids, and find no clear evidence of their existence. The size distribution of voids in the range 5-70 Angstrom (corresponding to physical sizes of approximately 3-35 comoving Mpc/h) is consistent with the standard model for the Lyman alpha forest without additional hot bubbles. We adapt a physical model for HII bubble growth during cosmological reionization (Furlanetto, Zaldarriaga and Hernquist 2004), to describe the expected size-distribution of hot super-bubbles at redshift around z = 3. This model incorporates the conjoining of bubbles around individual neighboring galaxies. Using the non-detection of voids, we find that models in which the volume filling factor of hot bubbles exceeds approximately 20 percent at z=3 can be ruled out, primarily because they overproduce the number of large (40-50 Angstrom) voids.

We find that boxy galaxies originate from mergers with a progenitor mass ratio $n < 2$ and with a combined cold gas mass fraction $F_{\\rm cold} < 0.1$. Our model accurately reproduces the observed fraction of boxy systems as a function of luminosity and halo mass, for both central galaxies and satellites. After correcting for the stellar mass dependence, the properties of the last major merger of early-type galaxies are independent of their halo mass. This provides theoretical support for the conjecture of Pasquali et al (2007) that the stellar mass of an early-type galaxy is the main parameter that governs its isophotal shape. We argue that the observed dichotomy of early-type galaxies has a natural explanation within hierarchical structure formation, and does not require AGN feedback. Rather, we argue that it owes to the fact that more massive systems (i) have more massive progenitors, (ii) assemble later, and (iii) have a larger fraction of early-type progenitors. Each of these three trends causes the cold gas mass fraction of the progenitors of more massive early-types to be lower, so that their last major merger was dryer. Finally, our model predicts that (i) less than 10 percent of all early-type galaxies form in major mergers that involve two early-type progenitors, (ii) more than 95 percent of all boxy early-type galaxies with $M_* < 2 \\times 10^{10} h^{-1} \\Msun$ are satellite galaxies, and (iii) about 70 percent of all low mass early-types do not form a supermassive black hole binary at their last major merger.

Many authors have therefore considered gene duplication as a driving force in shaping the topology of molecular networks.

Results: We extend current models of gene duplication and rewiring by including directions and the fact that molecular networks are not a result of unidirectional growth. We introduce upstream sites and downstream shapes to quantify potential links during duplication and rewiring. We find that this in itself generates the observed scaling of transcription factors for genome sites in procaryotes. The dynamical model can generate a scale-free degree distribution, p(k)&prop; 1/k^&gamma;, with exponent &gamma;=1 in the non-growing case, and with &gamma;>1 when the network is growing.   Conclusions: We find that duplication of genes followed by substantial recombination of upstream regions could generate main features of genetic regulatory networks.

Significant structural and evolutionary differences occur between simulations with and without heat conduction. Dense clouds in pure dynamical models experience dynamical destruction by Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability. In static models heat conduction leads to evaporation of such clouds. Heat conduction acting on clouds in a gas stream smooths out steep temperature and density gradients at the edge of the cloud because the conduction timescale is shorter than the cooling timescale. This diminishes the velocity gradient between the streaming plasma and the cloud, so that the timescale for the onset of KH instabilities increases, and the surface of the cloud becomes less susceptible to KH instabilities. The stabilisation effect of heat conduction against KH instability is more pronounced for smaller and less massive clouds.

The method is formulated and tested on the two-dimensional interior Poisson and exterior Laplace problems, whose solutions and their normal derivatives are required to be continuous across the interface. A complete basis of homogeneous solutions for the interior and exterior regions, corresponding to all possible Dirichlet boundary values at the interface, are calculated in a preprocessing step. This basis is used to construct the influence matrix which serves to transform the coupled boundary conditions into conditions on the interior problem. Chebyshev approximations are used to represent both the interior solutions and the boundary values. A standard Chebyshev spectral method is used to calculate the interior solutions. The exterior harmonic solutions are calculated as the convolution of the free-space Green's function with a surface density; this surface density is itself the solution to an integral equation which has an analytic solution when the boundary values are given as a Chebyshev expansion. Properties of Chebyshev approximations insure that the basis of exterior harmonic functions represents the external near-boundary solutions uniformly. The method is tested by calculating the electrostatic potential resulting from charge distributions in a rectangle.

Entanglement is at the heart of quantum physics, both for its conceptual foundations and for applications in information processing and quantum communication. Remarkably, entanglement can be \"swapped\": if one prepares two independent entangled pairs A1-A2 and B1-B2, a joint measurement on A1 and B1 (called a \"Bell-State Measurement\", BSM) has the effect of projecting A2 and B2 onto an entangled state, although these two particles have never interacted or shared any common past[1,2]. Experiments using twin photons produced by spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) have already demonstrated entanglement swapping[3-6], but here we present its first realization using continuous wave (CW) sources, as originally proposed[2]. The challenge was to achieve sufficiently sharp synchronization of the photons in the BSM. Using narrow-band filters, the coherence time of the photons that undergo the BSM is significantly increased, exceeding the temporal resolution of the detectors. Hence pulsed sources can be replaced by CW sources, which do not require any synchronization[6,7], allowing for the first time the use of completely autonomous sources. Our experiment exploits recent progress in the time precision of photon detectors, in the efficiency of photon pair production by SPDC with waveguides in nonlinear crystals[8], and in the stability of narrow-band filters.

The actors' collaboration is mainly based on the exchange /share product information. The representation of the actors' viewpoints is the underlying requirement of the collaborative product development. The multiple viewpoints approach was designed to provide an organizational framework following the actors' perspectives in the collaboration, and their relationships.

The problem we aim to solve is the information asymmetry that often occurs in collaborative development projects due to the different perspectives and expertise of members involved in the project.

The key idea of our approach is to leverage the multiple viewpoints of the members to enhance the retrieval of information. Our methodology involves the development of a collaborative knowledge management system that captures the multiple viewpoints of members through annotations, tags, and feedback mechanisms. The system also utilizes natural language processing techniques to identify and extract relevant information from multiple sources.  Our results indicate that our approach is effective in enhancing the retrieval of relevant information in collaborative development projects. We conducted a case study in a software development project and found that the system was able to retrieve relevant information with a high degree of accuracy. Furthermore, the members reported that the system was beneficial in supporting their collaboration and decision-making processes.  In conclusion, our approach of leveraging multiple viewpoints to enhance information retrieval in collaborative development projects is a promising solution to the problem of information asymmetry commonly faced by development teams.

A compressive wave is set up in a constant sub-Jeans density distribution of radius r = 1 pc. As the wave travels through the simulation grid, a shock-bounded spherical shell is formed. The inner shock of this shell reaches and bounces off the center, leaving behind a central core with an initially almost uniform density distribution, surrounded by an envelope consisting of the material in the shock-bounded shell, with a power-law density profile that at late times approaches a logarithmic slope of -2 even in non-collapsing cases. The resulting density structure resembles a quiescent core of radius < 0.1 pc, with a Bonnor-Ebert-like (BE-like) profile, although it has significant dynamical differences: it is initially non-self-gravitating and confined by the ram pressure of the infalling material, and consequently, growing continuously in mass and size. With the appropriate parameters, the core mass eventually reaches an effective Jeans mass, at which time the core begins to collapse. Thus, there is necessarily a time delay between the appearance of the core and the onset of its collapse, but this is not due to the dissipation of its internal turbulence as it is often believed.

The analogy enables one to introduce all the powerful tools of relativistic QED (albeit in a greatly simplified form). The Feynman diagrams and the propagators turn out to be very useful. In particular, the QED concept of the vacuum polarization finds its close counterpart in the photon scattering off a two level-system leading via the linear response theory to the general formulas for the atomic polarizability and the dynamic single spin susceptibility. To illustrate the usefulness of these methods, we calculate the polarizability and susceptibility up to the fourth order of perturbation theory.

Recent high-resolution radio observations showing a putative \"cometary tail\" pointing away from the Be star near periastron have been cited as support for the pulsar-wind model. We wish here to carry out a quantitative assessment of these competing models for this extraordinary source. We apply a 3D SPH code for dynamical simulations of both the pulsar-wind-interaction and accretion-jet models. The former yields a description of the shape of the wind-wind interaction surface. The latter provides an estimation of the accretion rate. The results allow critical evaluation of how the two distinct models confront the data in various wavebands under a range of conditions. When one accounts for the 3D dynamical wind interaction under realistic constraints for the relative strength of the B-star and pulsar winds, the resulting form of the interaction front does not match the putative \"cometary tail\" claimed from radio observations. On the other hand, dynamical simulations of the accretion-jet model indicate that the orbital phase variation of accretion power includes a secondary broad peak well away from periastron, thus providing a plausible way to explain the observed TeV gamma ray emission toward apastron.

The motivation for this work stems from the need to solve large and sparse eigenvalue problems arising in scientific and engineering applications. These problems are computationally intensive and often require the solution of a large number of eigenvalues and vectors. The traditional approach to solving these problems relies on iterative solvers, and the choice of a suitable preconditioner is critical for their convergence and efficiency. BLOPEX offers a flexible and effective framework for constructing preconditioners that take advantage of the spectral properties of the underlying matrix.   The main objective of this work is to evaluate the performance of BLOPEX preconditioners in the context of the hypre and PETSc libraries, two widely used software packages for solving linear systems and eigenvalue problems. We assess the scalability, robustness, and accuracy of BLOPEX, as well as its impact on the overall solution time. Our experiments show that BLOPEX can significantly improve the convergence and efficiency of iterative solvers for a wide range of eigenvalue problems. The key ideas behind BLOPEX are to split the preconditioner construction into small, tractable problems based on local matrix blocks and to exploit the Krylov subspace framework for solving the resulting eigenvalue problems.

The energy of the fundamental harmonic of the cyclotron resonance absorption line near the maximum of the X-ray flux from the source (luminosity range 5x10^{37} - 2x10^{38} erg/s) is ~11 keV. When the pulsar luminosity falls below ~5x10^{37} erg/s, the energy of the fundamental harmonic is displaced sharply toward the high energies, up to ~16 keV. Under the assumption of a dipole magnetic field configuration, this change in cyclotron harmonic energy corresponds to a decrease in the height of the emitting region by ~2 km, while other spectral parameters, in particular, the cutoff energy, remain essentially constant. At a luminosity ~7x10^{37} erg/s, four almost equidistant cyclotron line harmonics are clearly seen in the spectrum. This suggests that either the region where the emission originates is compact or the emergent spectrum from different (in height) segments of the accretion column is uniform.

A crucial parameter is the ratio P*= Pa/F0 of applied pressure P, acting on grains of diameter $a$, to maximum tensile contact force F0. At low P* the final structure depends on the level of velocity fluctuations at the early stages of cluster aggregation. With RR the coordination number approaches 2 in the limit of low initial velocities or large rolling friction.

This paper introduces the notion of \"canonical networks\", which is a class of regularly-structured networks whose capacities can be analyzed more easily than unstructured networks. We show that the throughput capacity of canonical networks under 802.11 has an analytical upper bound of 3L/4 when the source nodes are two or more hops away from the sink; and simulated throughputs of 0.690L (0.740L) when the source nodes are many hops away.

For this constraint to be as tight as possible, it is necessary to maximize the correlation between the two dipoles. This can be achieved by optimizing the survey window through which the flux dipole is measured. Here we explicitly construct such a window for the 2MASS survey. The optimization in essence reduces to excluding from the calculation of the flux dipole galaxies brighter than some limiting magnitude K_min of the near-infrared K_s band. This exclusion mitigates nonlinear effects and shot noise from small scales, which decorrelate the 2MASS dipole from the CMB dipole. Under the assumption of negligible shot noise we find that the optimal value of K_min is about five. Inclusion of shot noise shifts the optimal K_min to larger values. We present an analytical formula for shot noise for the 2MASS flux dipole, to be used in follow-up work with 2MASS data.   The misalignment angle between the two dipoles is a sensitive measure of their correlation: the higher the correlation, the smaller the expectation value of the angle. A minimum of the misalignment is thus a sign of the optimal gravity window. We model analytically the distribution function for the misalignment angle and show that the misalignment estimated by Maller et al. is consistent with the assumed underlying model (though it is greater than the expectation value). We predict with about 90% confidence that the misalignment will decrease if 2MASS galaxies brighter than K_min = 5 mag are excluded from the calculation of the flux dipole.

Using this simulator, the performance of carbon nanoribbon (CNR) MOSFETs is examined in the ballistic limit. The impact of quantum effects on device performance of CNR MOSFETs is also studied. We found that 2D semi-infinite graphene contacts provide metal-induced-gap-states (MIGS) in the CNR channel. These states would provide quantum tunneling in the short channel device and cause Fermi level pining. These effects cause device performance degradation both on the ON-state and the OFF-state. Pure 1D devices (infinite contacts), however, show no MIGS. Quantum tunneling effects are still playing an important role in the device characteristics. Conduction due to band-to-band tunneling is accurately captured in our simulations. It is important in these devices, and found to dominate the off-state current. Based on our simulations, both a 1.4nm wide and a 1.8nm wide CNR with channel length of 12.5nm can outperform ultra scaled Si devices in terms of drive current capabilities and electrostatic control.

The structures of the up-to-date highest-performing algorithms are presented, based on an operator scheme, which permits one to exploit the power of fast Fourier transforms. Using such an implementation of the generalized Wiener-filter in the novel ARGO-software package, the different numerical schemes are benchmarked with 1-, 2-, and 3-dimensional problems including structured white and Poissonian noise, data windowing and blurring effects. A novel numerical Krylov scheme is shown to be superior in terms of performance and fidelity. These fast inverse methods ultimately will enable the application of sampling techniques to explore complex joint posterior distributions. We outline how the space of the dark-matter density field, the peculiar velocity field, and the power spectrum can jointly be investigated by a Gibbs-sampling process. Such a method can be applied for the redshift distortions correction of the observed galaxies and for time-reversal reconstructions of the initial density field.

The motivation behind this work is the necessity to accurately trace the large-scale distribution of matter, which is presently unavailable through direct observation due to its complexity, inhomogeneity, and distance. Our method solves this problem by employing statistical methods and numerical optimization techniques to predict and reconstruct the underlying large-scale structure.  The key idea behind our approach is to use a combination of data sets, including Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation, and baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO), to identify the large-scale distribution of matter. We propose to use a statistical model based on a combination of Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. Moreover, we introduce a novel approach by employing an inverse algorithm to identify the three-dimensional distribution of matter from two-dimensional sky maps.

Here we present updated determinations of the basic physical properties of 2M0535-05, bolstering the surprising reversal of temperatures with mass in this system. We compare these measurements with widely used brown-dwarf evolutionary tracks, and find that the temperature reversal can be explained by some models if the components of 2M0535-05 are mildly non-coeval, possibly consistent with dynamical simulations of brown-dwarf formation. Alternatively, a strong magnetic field on the higher-mass brown dwarf might explain its anomalously low surface temperature, consistent with emerging evidence that convection is suppressed in magnetically active, low-mass stars.

This particular system is unique in that it consists of two brown dwarfs in a tight orbit around each other, which allows for precise measurements of their properties.  Our analysis of the system's light curve data revealed a surprising reversal of effective temperatures, where the cooler, less massive dwarf appeared to be hotter than the more massive one.

The abrupt variations reported ranged 0.2 to 1.1 magnitudes, on time-scales between 2 to 100 hours, with a preponderance found nearer Mira minimum light phases. However, the HIPPARCOS sampling frequency was extremely sparse and required confirmation because of potentially important atmospheric dynamics and dust-formation physics that could be revealed.

We observe that the fundamental period of Mira variables changes over time, which is consistent with the presence of pulsation-driven shock waves in their atmospheres. Furthermore, we detect the presence of secondary periods (with low amplitude) that could indicate the existence of non-radial pulsations, magnetic activity, or binarity in some of these stars.

In this work we focus our interest on the situation where the latter measure exhibits a continuous condensation transition at some finite critical density $\\rho_c$, irrespective of the dimensionality. The novelty comes from the case of asymmetric dynamics, where the target process has a nontrivial fluctuating stationary state, whose characteristics depend on the dimensionality.

At the time of observation, AR 8375 was young, AR 0330 mature, and AR 9575 decaying. The vertical velocity indicates that the elements of MMF pairs with polarity opposite to that of the sunspot support a downflow of around 50-100 m s$^{-1}$. The average Doppler shift difference between negative and positive elements of an MMF pair is about 150 m s$^{-1}$ in AR 8375, 100 m s$^{-1}$ in AR 0330, and 20 m s$^{-1}$ in AR 9575. These observational results are in agreement with the model that MMF pairs are part of a U-loop emanating from the sunspot's magnetic canopy. According to this model the downflow is caused by the Evershed flow returning below the solar surface. For AR 8375, the horizontal velocity of MMFs ranges from 0.1 km s$^{-1}$ to 0.7 km s$^{-1}$, and on average, the velocity of an MMF pair decreases significantly (from 0.6 km s$^{-1}$ to 0.35 km s$^{-1}$) with increasing distance from the MMF's birth place. This result suggests that the change in MMF flow speed does not reflect the radial structure of the moat flow, but rather is intrinsic to the evolution of the MMF pairs. This result is also in agreement with the U-loop model of MMF pairs. We also find that properties of MMF pairs, most strikingly the lifetime, depend on the evolution stages of the parent sunspot. The mean lifetimes of MMF pairs in ARs 9575 and 0330 are 0.7 hours and 1.6 hours, respectively, which is considerably shorter than the 4 hours lifetime previously found for AR 8375.

Using time-series data obtained from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory, we analyze the velocity profiles of MMF pairs located around sunspots.

Importantly, these results corroborate the predictions of the U-loop model, which attributes these features to the motion of the Sun's twisted magnetic fields.

The gamma-ray, X-ray and UV/optical emission all showed a peak ~75s after the trigger, although the optical and X-ray afterglow components also appear early on - before, or during, the main peak. Spectral evolution was seen throughout the burst, with the prompt emission showing a clear positive correlation between brightness and hardness. The Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of the prompt emission, stretching from 1eV up to 1MeV, is very flat, with a peak in the flux density at ~1keV. The optical-to-X-ray spectra at this time are better fitted by a broken, rather than single, power-law, similar to previous results for X-ray flares. The SED shows spectral hardening as the afterglow evolves with time. This behaviour might be a symptom of self-Comptonisation, although circumstellar densities similar to those found in the cores of molecular clouds would be required.

In the first scenario, realized in sufficiently hot and dense supernova cores, nucleation of an S-phase is sufficiently rapid so as to form an S-phase core, and implying M_max = M^S_max =~ 1.5M_sun. In the second scenario, nucleation of the S-phase at neutron star birth is too slow to materialize, and the star becomes cold without forming an S-phase core. Then, stellar mass can increase via accretion, until central density \\rho_crit is reached, and the S phase forms. This N branch of neutron stars ends at M=M_crit. We select several models of N-phase satifying the necessary condition M^N_max > 2M_sun and combine them with models of kaon condensation and quark deconfinement. For kaon condensation, we get M_crit =~ M^S_max =~ 1.5M_sun, which is ruled out by PSR J0751+1807. On the contrary, for the EOSs with quark deconfinement we get M_crit =~ M^N_max > 2M_sun, which reconciles SN1987A and PSR J0751+1807. ", "machine_text": "In this work, we aim to reconcile the observations of two branches of neutron stars: the first, a high-mass pulsar with a mass of around 2 M_sun, and the second, a neutron star formed by the explosion of the supernova SN1987A, which has a lower mass. This discrepancy has puzzled physicists for years, and we want to provide a solution that helps us understand the underlying physics of neutron stars.  The motivation for this research is clear: neutron stars are one of the most enigmatic objects in the universe, with extreme conditions that challenge our understanding of fundamental physics. Their properties, such as their mass, radius, and spin, can reveal the nature of the densest matter in the universe. However, current models and simulations struggle to explain the existence of these two different branches.  To tackle this problem, we propose a new theoretical framework that explains the two branches as the result of different physical mechanisms. In particular, we suggest that the high-mass pulsar was formed by a mechanism that enhances the mass of a newborn neutron star through a strong magnetic field, while SN1987A is the result of a failed core-collapse supernova that left a smaller neutron star.  Our key idea is to use a combination of numerical simulations and analytical calculations to support this hypothesis. We also compare our results with the latest observations of neutron stars to validate the consistency of our model.

Our results showed that collisions between equal-sized agglomerates of ice grains can be classified into three types: sticking, bouncing, and fragmentation. We also found that the outcome of a collision depended on the initial conditions, such as the impact angle and velocity. The sticking collisions were more likely to occur at lower impact velocities, while fragmentation was more common at higher velocities.  The study explores the fundamental mechanics of ice agglomerate collisions, which is essential for understanding the processes that form and shape our solar system's planets and comets. Furthermore, the study provides essential data for the future development of numerical models and computational simulations of these types of collisions.

In the framework of the flux rope catastrophe model for CMEs, the energy may be abruptly released either by an ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) catastrophe, which belongs to a global magnetic topological instability of the system, or by a fast magnetic reconnection across preexisting or rapidly-developing electric current sheets. Both ways of magnetic energy release are thought to be important to CME dynamics. To disentangle their contributions, we construct a flux rope catastrophe model in the corona and solar wind and compare different cases in which we either prohibit or allow magnetic reconnection to take place across rapidly-growing current sheets during the eruption. It is demonstrated that CMEs, even fast ones, can be produced taking the ideal MHD catastrophe as the only process of magnetic energy release. Nevertheless, the eruptive speed can be significantly enhanced after magnetic reconnection sets in. In addition, a smooth transition from slow to fast eruptions is observed when increasing the strength of the background magnetic field, simply because in a stronger field there is more free magnetic energy at the catastrophic point available to be released during an eruption. This suggests that fast and slow CMEs may have an identical driving mechanism.

Furthermore, quantum gravity effects are expected to induce proton instability, indicating that the higher energy cutoff scale must be above 10^{16}GeV. Quasi-realistic heterotic string models provide the arena to explore how perturbative quantum gravity affects the particle physics phenomenology. An appealing explanation for the proton longevity is provided by the existence of an Abelian gauge symmetry that suppresses the proton decay mediating operators. Additionally, such a low-scale U(1) symmetry should: allow the suppression of the left-handed neutrino masses by a seesaw mechanism; allow fermion Yukawa couplings to the electroweak Higgs doublets; be anomaly free; be family universal. These requirements render the existence of such U(1) symmetries in quasi-realistic heterotic string models highly non-trivial. We demonstrate the existence of a U(1) symmetry that satisfies all of the above requirements in a class of left-right symmetric heterotic string models in the free fermionic formulation. The existence of the extra Z' in the energy range accessible to future experiments is motivated by the requirement of adequate suppression of proton decay mediation.

The chemical evolution models for Draco and Ursa Minor, which are able to reproduce several observational features of these two galaxies, such as the several abundance ratios, take up-to-date nucleosynthesis into account for intermediate-mass stars and supernovae of both types, as well as the effect of these objects on the energetics of the systems. For both galaxies, the model that best fits the data contains an intense continuous galactic wind, occurring at a rate proportional to the star formation rate. Models with a wind rate assumed to be proportional only to the supernova rate also reproduce the observed SMD, but do not match the gas mass, whereas the models with no galactic winds fail to reproduce the observed SMDs. In the case of Ursa Minor, the same model as in previous works reproduces the observed distribution very well with no need to modify the main parameters of the model. The model for Draco, on the other hand, is slightly modified. The observed SMD requires a model with a lower supernova type Ia thermalization efficiency ($\\eta_{SNeIa}$ = 0.5 instead of $\\eta_{SNeIa}$ = 1.0) in order to delay the galactic wind, whereas all the other parameters are kept the same.

The IHV-index for a geomagnetic element is mechanically derived from hourly values as the sum of the unsigned differences between adjacent hours over a seven-hour interval centered on local midnight. The index is derived separately for stations in both hemispheres within six longitude sectors using only local night hours. It is intended as a long-term index. Available data allows derivation of the index back well into the 19th century. On a time scale of a 27-day Bartels rotation, IHV averages for stations with corrected geomagnetic latitude less than 55 degrees are strongly correlated with midlatitude range indices. Assuming a constant calibration of the aa-index we find that observed yearly values of aa before the year 1957 are 2.9 nT too small compared to values calculated from IHV using the regression constants based on 1980-2004. We interpret this discrepancy as an indication that the calibration of the aa index is in error before 1957. There is no such problem with the ap index. Rotation averages of IHV are also strongly correlated with solar wind parameters (BV^2).

The spectra from the clouds are inconsistent with shock or ``shock + precursor'' ionization models, but they are consistent with photoionization by the quasar nucleus. The best-fit photoionization model requires a low-metallicity (12+log(O/H) < 8.7) two-phase medium, consisting of a matter-bounded diffuse component with a unity filling-factor (N ~ 1 \\cc, T ~ 15000 K), in which are embedded small, dense clouds (N ~ 400 \\cc, T ~ 10^4 K).

This allows sufficient separation of scales to observe a Navier-Stokes (NS) inertial range followed by a 2nd LANS inertial range. The analysis of the third-order structure function scaling supports the predicted l^3 scaling; it corresponds to a k^(-1) scaling of the energy spectrum. The energy spectrum itself shows a different scaling which goes as k^1. This latter spectrum is consistent with the absence of stretching in the sub-filter scales due to the Taylor frozen-in hypothesis employed as a closure in the derivation of LANS. These two scalings are conjectured to coexist in different spatial portions of the flow. The l^3 (E(k) k^(-1)) scaling is subdominant to k^1 in the energy spectrum, but the l^3 scaling is responsible for the direct energy cascade, as no cascade can result from motions with no internal degrees of freedom. We verify the prediction for the size of the LANS attractor resulting from this scaling. From this, we give a methodology either for arriving at grid-independent solutions for LANS, or for obtaining a formulation of a LES optimal in the context of the alpha models. The fully converged grid-independent LANS may not be the best approximation to a direct numerical simulation of the NS equations since the minimum error is a balance between truncation errors and the approximation error due to using LANS instead of the primitive equations.

In most regions of these disks, gas attains sub-Keplerian speeds as a consequence of a negative pressure gradient. Hydrodynamic drag leads to orbital decay and depletion of the solid material in the disk, with characteristic timescales as short as only a few hundred years for meter-sized objects at 1 AU. In this paper, we suggest a particle retention mechanism which promotes the accumulation of grains and the formation of planetesimals near the water sublimation front or ``snow line.'' This model is based on the assumption that, in the regions most interesting for planet formation, the viscous evolution of the disk is due to turbulence driven by the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) in the surface layers of the disk. The depth to which MRI effectively generates turbulence is a strong function of the grain size and abundance. A sharp increase in the grain-to-gas density ratio across the snow line reduces the column depth of the active layer. As the disk evolves towards a quasi-steady-state, this change in the active layer creates a local maximum in radial distribution of the gas surface density and pressure, causing the gas to rotate at super-Keplerian speed and halting the inward migration of grains.

We find a very good correspondence between these observations and the simulation, in terms of number, angular size, velocity distribution, overall flux and flux distribution of the clouds. We show that condensed cloud accretion only accounts for ~ 0.2 M_solar / year of the current overall Galactic accretion in the simulations.

The parameter space of the simulated clouds is consistent with all of the observed HVC complexes that have distance constraints, except the Magellanic Stream which is known to have a different origin. We also find that nearly half of these simulated halo clouds would be indistinguishable from lower-velocity gas and that this effect is strongest further from the disk of the galaxy, thus indicating a possible missing population of HVCs.

We analyzed their activity by the Fokker-Planck method.

However, sparse coding requires a large number of neurons to represent a given input, which may be costly in terms of metabolic resources. In contrast, dense coding uses fewer neurons but may result in more overlapping neural representations, potentially leading to interference and decreased discrimination ability.  To explore these tradeoffs, we trained an SNN with a layered architecture on a set of visual stimuli and varied the sparsity and density of neuronal activity within each layer. Our results demonstrate that sparser coding improves the network's ability to discriminate between similar patterns, while denser coding is advantageous for learning and recalling diverse patterns. Interestingly, we found that intermediate levels of sparsity and density provide a balance between these competing demands and lead to the most efficient storage and retrieval of information.

The effective formation height increases generally with wavelength and also from disk-centre towards the solar limb. The average intensity contribution functions are usually rather broad and in some cases they are even double-peaked as there are contributions from hot shock waves and cool post-shock regions in the model chromosphere. Taking into account the deviations from ionisation equilibrium for hydrogen gives a less strong variation of the electron density and with it of the optical depth. The result is a narrower formation height range. The average brightness temperature increases with wavelength and towards the limb.

As a consequence, the scattering rate P(r) drops much faster with increasing distance than the previously assumed 1/r^2 profile. Near the source (r<1Mpc comoving), the scattering rate of photons that redshift into the Ly_alpha resonance converges to P(r) \\propto r^{-7/3}. The scattering rate of Ly_alpha photons produced by splitting of photons that redshift into a higher resonance (Ly_gamma, Ly_delta, etc.) is only weakly affected by the radiative transfer, while the sum of scattering rates of Ly_alpha photons produced from all higher resonances also converges to P(r) \\propto r^{-7/3} near the source.

While the RGS data are of insufficient quality to allow a meaningful analysis, the EPIC data show a remarkable X-ray spectrum. The 2-10 keV continuum is described by a heavily absorbed (Nh~ 1e22 - 1e23 cm-2) power law with photon index Gamma ~1.4, and strong (R~2) cold reflection. A narrow, unresolved Fe Kalpha emission line is detected, confirming previous findings, with EW 120eV. A soft excess is present below 2 keV over the extrapolation of the hard X-ray power law, which we model with a power law with the same photon index as the hard power law, absorbed by a column density Nh=6e20 cm-2 in excess to Galactic. A host of emission lines are present below 2 keV, confirming previous indications from ASCA, due to H- and He-like O, Mg, and Si. We attribute the origin of the lines to a photoionized gas, with properties very similar to radio-quiet obscured AGN. Two different ionized media, or a single stratified medium, are required to fit the soft X-ray data satisfactorily. The similarity of the X-ray spectrum of 3C445 to Seyferts underscores that the central engines of radio-loud and radio-quiet AGN similarly host both cold and warm gas.

This remarkable spectrum shows a prominent excess at energies above 4 keV, which can be modeled by a broad Gaussian line centered at 6.7 keV, a prominent iron K-alpha line. This feature is characteristic of reflection from cold, dense matter in the vicinity of a supermassive black hole and indicates the presence of a Compton-thick torus in 3C 445. Moreover, we detect two narrow lines at 6.4 keV and 6.7 keV, which are consistent with Fe K-alpha fluorescence and Fe XXV He-like line emission, respectively.  The motivation for this research is to understand the nature and properties of the X-ray emission from BLRGs, which is still not well understood. BLRGs are a subclass of radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN), which show strong and broad emission lines in their optical spectra. Understanding the relationship between the optical and X-ray emission in these objects is crucial to understand their physical processes and to use them as probes of the evolution of AGN across cosmic time.  The problem this work attempts to solve is to provide clear evidence for the presence of a Compton-thick torus in BLRGs, which has previously been suggested by models and indirect observations. Our Chandra observations of 3C 445 allow us to confirm this hypothesis and to discuss the implications for the properties of the black hole accretion flow and the AGN environment.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "arxiv", "source_ID": 704.3053}

This is particularly significant in studies of reionization, where the dynamic range is the principal limiting factor. We test our halo-finding and HII bubble-finding algorithms independently against N-body simulations with radiative transfer and obtain excellent agreement.

We find even larger ionized bubbles than do purely analytic models at the same volume-weighted mean hydrogen neutral fraction. We also generate maps and power spectra of 21-cm brightness temperature fluctuations, which for the first time include corrections due to gas bulk velocities. We find that velocities widen the tails of the temperature distributions and increase small-scale power, though these effects quickly diminish as reionization progresses. We also include some preliminary results from a simulation run with the largest dynamic range to date: a 250 Mpc box that resolves halos with masses M >~ 2.2 x10^8 M_sun.

Such a singularity can cause an anisotropic variation in the coupling strength, which may partially explain the so-called nodal-antinodal dichotomy in the cuprates. Here we show that the topology of the graphene band structure at dopings comparable to the GICs is quite similar to that of the cuprates and that the quasiparticle dynamics in graphene have a similar dichotomy.

Supernova-fallback disks result in a distribution of solids confined to within 1-2 AU and produce the requisite material to form the three known planets surrounding PSR 1257+12. Tidal disruption disks tend to slightly underproduce solids interior to 1 AU, required for forming the pulsar planets, while overproducing the amount of solids where no body, lunar mass or greater, exists.

We examine two subsamples, one containing the systems with emission line ratios most like star-forming systems, and one with the sources that have characteristic AGN ratios.

For both cases we find a strong, almost identical, correlation between [OIII] and radio luminosity, with the AGN sample extending toward lower, and the star-formation sample toward higher luminosities. A clearer separation between the two subsamples is seen as function of the central velocity dispersion of the host galaxy.

Our simulation involved the development of a mathematical model that represents the quantum kinetics of the system under study that allowed us to simulate the production process. Our experimental studies were designed to mimic the conditions of the model and confirm our simulation results.   Our findings revealed that quantum kinetics can produce a completely sterile species through a multi-step process that includes the creation of an intermediate state. This process is sensitive to the time and energy requirements of the reaction and can result in a high yield of the desired product. Our research provides a new and valuable approach for the production of a sterile species.   The motivation behind this work was to address the growing concern for the use of sterilization methods that involve harmful radiation or chemicals. Our findings have the potential to contribute to the development of safer and more effective methods for producing a sterile species.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "arxiv", "source_ID": 705.0703}

Dimer models are a type of statistical mechanics model that describe the formation of dimers on a lattice, while free fermions are particles that obey Fermi-Dirac statistics and can move freely in a lattice. Super quantum mechanics, on the other hand, is a generalization of quantum mechanics that incorporates supersymmetry. We aim to understand how these three concepts are related and use this understanding to gain insights into the behavior of physical systems.  To achieve this, we begin by introducing the mathematical framework for dimer models, free fermions, and super quantum mechanics. We then explore how these frameworks interact, focusing on the mathematics that underline their relationship. Our key idea is that certain dimer models have a hidden supersymmetry that emerges when they are described using free fermions. We formalize this relationship using mathematical tools, including complex analysis and representation theory.  Our results show that understanding the relationship between dimer models, free fermions, and super quantum mechanics provides a new perspective on the behavior of physical systems. We demonstrate this by using our insights to address several open problems in statistical mechanics and condensed matter physics.

However, the process of collaboration introduces significant delay, since all collaborating nodes need access to the same information. In this paper, a technique that significantly reduces the collaboration overhead is proposed. It consists of two phases. In the first phase, nodes transmit locally in a random access fashion. Collisions, when they occur, are viewed as linear mixtures of the collided packets. In the second phase, a set of cooperating nodes acts as a distributed antenna system and beamform the received analog waveform to one or more faraway destinations. This step requires multiplication of the received analog waveform by a complex number, which is independently computed by each cooperating node, and which enables separation of the collided packets based on their final destination. The scheme requires that each node has global knowledge of the network coordinates. The proposed scheme can achieve high throughput, which in certain cases exceeds one.

Considering the strong dependence of planet frequency on stellar metallicity, we studied the metal rich old open cluster NGC 6791 and searched for close-in planets using the transit technique.   Methods. A ten-night observational campaign was performed using the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (3.6m), the San Pedro M\\'artir telescope (2.1m), and the Loiano telescope (1.5m).

Should the frequency and properties of close-in planets in NGC 6791 be similar to those orbiting field stars of similar metallicity, then detailed simulations foresee the presence of 2-3 transiting planets.

The simple approximation is equivalent to an extended patch model, a simple metapopulation model with patches colonized by prey, patches colonized by predators and empty patches. This approximation is capable of describing the limited available space for species occupancy. The pair approximation is moreover able to describe two types of coexistence of prey and predators: one where population densities are constant in time and another displaying self-sustained time-oscillations of the population densities. The oscillations are associated with limit cycles and arise through a Hopf bifurcation.

Random motions within the Local Sheet are small. Our Galaxy participates in the bulk motion of the Local Sheet away from the Local Void.

Our work responds to the need to understand the formation and evolution of galaxies, which remain active areas of research in modern astrophysics. The challenge lies in teasing out the details of star formation and chemical enrichment histories, which are encoded in the spectra of the galaxies we observe.  To accomplish this, VESPA uses a Bayesian framework that incorporates a library of composite stellar populations to fit the observed spectra. This approach enables us to simultaneously extract the overall star formation and metallicity histories, as well as the contributions of individual stellar populations at different times.  We demonstrate the power of VESPA by applying it to a sample of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Our results indicate that the star formation histories of these galaxies vary widely, ranging from smooth and gradual to more rapid and episodic. Additionally, we find that metallicity evolution shows a mild dependence on star formation rate, as expected from theoretical models.

Thus, the intrinsic features of such machinery are not accessible directly from (known) network properties. Rather, what one can see are the global patterns of its use and, thus, a global view of the power and organization of the underlying grammar. Taking a look into more practical issues, the paper examines how to build a net from the projection of syntactic relations. Recall that, as opposed to adult grammars, early-child language has not a well-defined concept of structure. To overcome such difficulty, we develop a set of systematic criteria assuming constituency hierarchy and a grammar based on lexico-thematic relations. At the end, what we obtain is a well defined corpora annotation that enables us i) to perform statistics on the size of structures and ii) to build a network from syntactic relations over which we can perform the standard measures of complexity.

Furthermore, the use of network statistics allowed us to examine how different syntactic structures were interconnected and how these networks evolved over time.  To achieve these goals, we used a corpus of Old English texts spanning from the 7th to the 11th century and applied network-based clustering techniques to identify nodes and edges representing syntactic relationships. We also examined various metrics, including degree centrality and betweenness, to identify important nodes in the network. Our results showed that certain syntactic categories, such as prepositions, tended to be highly central in the network, while other categories, such as adjectives, were less central. We also found evidence of evolution in the syntactic network over time, with earlier texts being characterized by more complex, hierarchical structures than later texts.

The second step consists in writing this graph as a program in Soft Constraint Logic Programming (SCLP): the engine of this framework is then able to find the best paths/trees by optimizing their costs and solving the constraints imposed on them (e.g. delay < 40msec), thus finding a solution to QoS routing problems. Moreover, c-semiring structures are a convenient tool to model QoS metrics.

The layer is then fully fluidized since macroscopic, fluid-like phenomena such as convection rolls and surface waves are observed. Increasing the total dissipation (by either decreasing the restitution coefficient or increasing the total number of particles) decreases the increase in granular temperature and rms particle displacement at fluidization, and shifts the increase to higher accelerations.

To test string theory using CMB, we focused on three key predictions of the theory. First, string theory predicts that the universe has extra dimensions beyond our four visible dimensions, which could manifest themselves as distortions in the CMB. Second, the theory predicts the existence of cosmic strings - topological defects formed during the universe's early phase transitions - that could produce gravitational waves affecting the CMB. Finally, string theory predicts the presence of specific patterns in the CMB that could arise from the so-called \"brane inflation\".  We simulated CMB maps with these predictions and compared them with the latest Planck data.

The aim of the present work was to derive chemical and physical parameters of a set of HII regions, and from them the metallicity gradient. Electron temperatures and chemical abundances were derived for the 14 HII regions where both [OII] and [OIII] emission line fluxes were measured, including the electron temperature sensitive emission line [OIII] 436.3 nm and in a few cases [NII] 575.5 nm.

The presence of abundance gradients was inferred from the radial behaviour of several emission-line ratios, and accurately measured from chemical abundances directly derived in 14 HII regions. The oxygen abundances of our HII regions, located in the radial region from ~2 to ~7.2 kpc, gave an oxygen gradient -0.054+/-0.011 dex/kpc The overall oxygen gradient for M 33 obtained using ours and previous oxygen determinations in a large number of HII regions with direct electron temperature determination as well as abundance in young stars presented a two slope shape: -0.19 dex/kpc for the central regions (R<3kpc), and -0.038dex/kpc for the outer regions (R>=3kpc).

Our results show that M 33 has a mild negative metallicity gradient, with a slope of -0.034 dex/kpc. The metallicity gradient is steeper in the inner part of the galaxy than in the outer part, consistent with the idea of inside-out disk growth. We also find that the metallicity gradient flattens beyond a galactocentric radius of 3 kpc, which may indicate the transition from disk-dominated to halo-dominated regions.  The main motivation for this research is to better understand the chemical enrichment history of M 33 and its relation to other spiral galaxies.

Its potential theory for open bounded sets has been well developed throughout the recent years however almost nothing was known about the behaviour of the process on unbounded sets. The present paper is intended to fill this gap and we provide two-sided sharp estimates for the Green function for a half-space. As a byproduct we obtain some improvements of the estimates known for bounded sets specially for balls. The advantage of these estimates is a clarification of the relationship between the diameter of the ball and the parameter $m$ of the process.   The main result states that the Green function is comparable with the Green function for the Brownian motion if the points are away from the boundary of a half-space and their distance is greater than one. On the other hand for the remaining points the Green function is somehow related the Green function for the isotropic $\\alpha$-stable process.

Fitting an axisymmetric model shows that the non-circular motions must be comparable in amplitude to the circular motions (120 km/s). Fitting a model based on elliptical orbits allows us to identify with confidence the single inner Lindblad resonance (ILR) of the large scale bar. Finally, a model based on analytical solutions for the gas particle orbits in a weakly barred potential constrained by the ILR radius reproduces the observations well. The mass inflow rate is then estimated and discussed based on the best fit model solution.

As a result, the strength of HI absorption near galaxies is not reduced by galactic winds, but even slightly increases. We also find that a lack of HI absorption for lines of sight (LOS) close to galaxies, as found by Adelberger et al., can be created by hot gas around the galaxies induced by accretion shock heating. In contrast to HI, metal absorption systems are sensitive to the presence of winds. The models without feedback can produce the strong CIV and OVI absorption lines in LOS within 50 kpc from galaxies, while strong SN feedback is capable of creating strong CIV and OVI lines out to about twice that distance. We also analyze the mean transmissivity of HI, CIV, and OVI within 1 h$^{-1}$ Mpc from star-forming galaxies. The probability distribution of the transmissivity of HI is independent of the strength of SN feedback, but strong feedback produces LOS with lower transmissivity of metal lines.

As evaluation is differently perceived and modeled among educational areas, it is not difficult to become trapped in dilemmas, which reflects an epistemological weakness. Additionally, designing and developing a computer-based learning scenario is not an easy task. Advancing further, with end-users probing the system in realistic settings, is even harder. Computer science research in evaluation faces an immense challenge, having to cope with contributions from several conflicting and controversial research fields. We believe that deep changes must be made in our field if we are to advance beyond the CBT (computer-based training) learning model and to build an adequate epistemology for this challenge. The first task is to relocate our field by building upon recent results from philosophy, psychology, social sciences, and engineering. In this article we locate evaluation in respect to communication studies. Evaluation presupposes a definition of goals to be reached, and we suggest that it is, by many means, a silent communication between teacher and student, peers, and institutional entities. If we accept that evaluation can be viewed as set of invisible rules known by nobody, but somehow understood by everybody, we should add anthropological inquiries to our research toolkit.

On length scales shorter than a crossover length (which grows with the strength of surface tension), the effective interface roughness exponent $\\zeta$ is $\\simeq 1.20$, close to the expected value for the universality class of the quenched Edwards-Wilkinson model. We find that the waiting times between avalanches are fully uncorrelated, as the wavelet transform of their autocorrelations scales as white noise. Similarly, detrended size-size correlations give a white-noise wavelet transform.

The critical interface model is a theoretical framework for describing the dynamics of a material's magnetic domains during the magnetic field-induced Barkhausen effect. We use numerical simulations to generate synthetic Barkhausen noise signals within this framework. The wavelet transform is then applied to these signals to extract useful features, such as the decay rate of the signal's power spectrum.   Our methodology involves comparing the results of wavelet transforms applied to simulated Barkhausen noise signals in the critical interface model with those from experimental data. We find that the wavelet approach significantly improves the resolution of the Barkhausen noise signal, allowing us to extract additional information.

To do this, we study the mid-IR contribution of PAH emission, continuum, and extinction. About 3/4 of our sample are continuum- (i.e. AGN) dominated sources, but ~60% of these show PAH emission, suggesting the presence of star-formation activity.

The lower bound is established by a reduction from the word problem for alternating (k-1)-fold exponential space bounded Turing Machines. Since there are fixed machines of that type whose word problems are already hard with respect to k-fold exponential time, we obtain, as a corollary, k-fold exponential time completeness for the data complexity of our fragments of HFL, provided m exceeds 3.

Collaborative beamforming (CB) and cooperative transmission (CT) have recently emerged as new communication techniques that enable and leverage effective resource sharing among collaborative/cooperative nodes. In this paper, we seek to maximize the lifetime of sensor networks by using the new idea that closely located nodes can use CB/CT to reduce the load or even avoid packet forwarding requests to nodes that have critical battery life. First, we study the effectiveness of CB/CT to improve the signal strength at a faraway destination using energy in nearby nodes. Then, a 2D disk case is analyzed to assess the resulting performance improvement. For general networks, if information-generation rates are fixed, the new routing problem is formulated as a linear programming problem; otherwise, the cost for routing is dynamically adjusted according to the amount of energy remaining and the effectiveness of CB/CT. From the analysis and simulation results, it is seen that the proposed schemes can improve the lifetime by about 90% in the 2D disk network and by about 10% in the general networks, compared to existing schemes.

WSNs have a limited lifespan due to their battery constraints, and in many cases, replacing them is not practical. Therefore, extending the lifetime of WSN is of great importance.   We proposed a novel CBCT approach that combines two techniques, collaboration among sensor nodes and beamforming. The proposed approach optimizes the energy efficiency of the network by reducing the energy consumption of each node. The CBCT approach also makes the transmission more reliable and resilient against interferences and obstacles.   Our experimental simulations showed that the proposed CBCT method could improve the network's lifetime by nearly 20% compared to traditional techniques. Additionally, our results showed that our approach outperformed existing solutions in terms of reliability, energy consumption, and network lifetime.   In conclusion, this work demonstrates the effectiveness of CBCT in improving the lifetime of WSNs. The innovative approach combines the benefits of beamforming and cooperative transmission to optimize the energy consumption and enhance the lifetime of the WSN.

We discovered nulling for 8 sources and 8 pulsars are found to intermittently emit single pulses that have pulse energies similar to giant pulses. It is estimated that at least half of the total population of pulsars have drifting subpulses when observations with a high enough signal-to-noise ratio would be available. It could well be that the drifting subpulse mechanism is an intrinsic property of the emission mechanism itself, although for some pulsars it is difficult or impossible to detect. Drifting subpulses are in general found at both frequencies, although the chance of detecting drifting subpulses is possibly slightly higher at 92 cm. It appears that the youngest pulsars have the most disordered subpulses and the subpulses become more and more organized into drifting subpulses as the pulsar ages. The correlations with the modulation indices are argued to be consistent with the picture in which the radio emission can be divided in a drifting subpulse signal plus a quasi-steady signal which becomes, on average, stronger at high observing frequencies.

We estimate the free energy, the end-to-end distance, the number of imprisoned monomers, the order parameter, and its distribution. It is shown that in the thermodynamic limit of large N and L but finite L/N, there is a small but finite jump in several average characteristics, including the order parameter. We also present a theoretical description based on the Landau free energy approach, which is in good agreement with the simulation results.

We first attempted to determine the order using Monte Carlo simulations, but encountered challenges in accurately measuring the system properties as it approached the transition. We then applied mean-field theory to analyze the transition, and found that the escape transition is a second-order phase transition.

The lack of knowledge about the neutrino masses and their mixing patterns has been a longstanding issue in particle physics that can have a profound impact on our understanding of the universe.   The problem with neutrino masses arises from the fact that the neutrinos are massless in the standard model, which assumes that the neutrinos have no mass. However, various experiments, including the MiniBooNE experiment, have provided evidence that the neutrinos do have mass. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new theories and models to explain this phenomenon.

We report a sensitive upper limit on its radio flux density of 12 uJy at 2 GHz using the NRAO GBT. Timing using XMM and Chandra over a 2.4 yr span reveals no significant change in its spin period. The 2 sigma upper limit on the period derivative leads, in the dipole spin-down formalism, to an energy loss rate E-dot < 7e33 ergs/s, surface magnetic field strength B_p < 1.5e11 G, and characteristic age tau_c = P/2P-dot > 8 Myr. This tau_c exceeds the age of the SNR by 3 orders of magnitude, implying that the pulsar was born spinning at its current period. However, the X-ray luminosity of PSR J1852+0040, L(bol) ~ 3e33(d/7.1 kpc)^2 ergs/s is a large fraction of E-dot, which challenges the rotation-powered assumption. Instead, its high blackbody temperature, 0.46+/-0.04 keV, small blackbody radius ~ 0.8 km, and large pulsed fraction, ~ 80%, may be evidence of accretion onto a polar cap, possibly from a fallback disk made of supernova debris. If B_p < 1e10 G, an accretion disk can penetrate the light cylinder and interact with the magnetosphere while resulting torques on the neutron star remain within the observed limits. A weak B-field is also inferred in another CCO, the 424-ms pulsar 1E 1207.4-5209, from its steady spin and soft X-ray absorption lines. We propose this origin of radio-quiet CCOs: the B-field, derived from a turbulent dynamo, is weaker if the NS is formed spinning slowly, which enables it to accrete SN debris. Accretion excludes neutron stars born with both B_p < 1e11 G and P > 0.1 s from radio pulsar surveys, where B_p < 1e11 G is not encountered except among very old (tau_c > 40 Myr) or recycled pulsars.

Most high redshift systems (14/20) exhibit absorption over the entire system velocity range, which differs from the result for low redshift systems (18/36) at the 95% level.

The existence of gravitational radiation was first predicted by Einstein in 1916, however gravitational waves have not yet been directly observed.

As the system loses energy the bodies spiral towards each other. This causes their orbital speed and the amount of gravitational radiation to increase, producing a characteristic ``chirp'' waveform in the LIGO sensitive band. In this thesis, matched filtering of LIGO science data is used to search for low mass binary systems in the halo of dark matter surrounding the Milky Way. Observations of gravitational microlensing events of stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud suggest that some fraction of the dark matter in the halo may be in the form of Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs). It has been proposed that low mass black holes formed in the early universe may be a component of the MACHO population; some fraction of these black hole MACHOs will be in binary systems and detectable by LIGO.

Fitting the Balmer lines of the white dwarfs in the cluster, using Keck/LRIS spectra, suggests that most of these stars are undermassive, <M> = 0.43 +/- 0.06 Msun, and therefore could not have formed from canonical stellar evolution involving the helium flash at the tip of the red giant branch.

The first model represents a stochastically-perturbed flux transport dynamo. Here even very weak stochastic perturbations can give rise to significant modulation in the activity cycle. This modulation leads to a loss of predictability. In the second model, we neglect stochastic effects and assume that generation of magnetic field in the Sun can be described by a fully deterministic nonlinear mean-field model -- this is a best case scenario for prediction. We designate the output from this deterministic model (with parameters chosen to produce chaotically modulated cycles) as a target timeseries that subsequent deterministic mean-field models are required to predict.

Furthermore, we show that even short-term prediction is impossible if there is a small discrepancy in the input parameters from the fiducial model.

This method allows the incorporation of new observations over time and provides us with a constantly updated estimate of the solar activity levels. We then apply this approach to the observed solar cycle data and compare our predictions with the actual observations. Our analysis shows that our new method outperforms the traditional mean-field models and provides more accurate predictions of the solar cycle. Furthermore, we use our approach to make predictions for the next solar cycle, which is expected to peak around 2025. Our results suggest that the activity levels during the next solar cycle will be similar to the current cycle, with a peak in activity around 2025.

In this work we suggest that the anomalies are due to the super position of two different events: 1) PRIMORDIAL SELF-ENRICHMENT: this is asked to explain the oxygen depletion down to a minimum value [O/Fe]~ -0.4; 2) EXTRA MIXING IN A FRACTION OF THE STARS ALREADY BORN WITH ANOMALOUS COMPOSITION: these objects, starting with already low [O/Fe], will reduce the oxygen abundance down to the most extreme values. Contrary to other models that invoke extra mixing to explain the chemical anomalies, we suggest that it is active only if there is a fraction of the stars in which the primordial composition is not only oxygen depleted, but also extremely helium rich (Y~ 0.4), as found in a few GCs from their main sequence multiplicity. We propose that the rotational evolution (and an associated extra mixing) of extremely helium rich stars may be affected by the fact that they develop a very small or non existent molecular weight barrier during the evolution. We show that extra mixing in these stars, having initial chemistry that has already been CNO processed, affects mainly the oxygen abundance, and to a much smaller extent if affects the sodium abundance.

The sample was observed with medium-resolution, optical spectroscopy and contains some galaxies with unpublished velocity dispersion measurements and emission-line fluxes. Measured velocity dispersions are 130-340 km/s with a mean of 216 km/s. Converting to BH mass, we find that the BH mass distribution is identical for FRIs and FRIIs, with a mean of approximately 2.5x10^8 Msun. We convert [OII] and [OIII] emission-line luminosities to photoionizing luminosity under the assumption that the gas is ionized by the nuclear UV continuum. Most of the galaxies with FRI morphology and/or low-excitation emission-line spectra have progressively lower BH masses at lower photoionizing (and jet) luminosities. This agrees with the Ledlow-Owen relation which states that the radio luminosity at the FRI/FRII transition depends on the optical luminosity of the host, L_radio ~ L_optical^1.8, because both L_radio and L_optical relate to AGN nuclear parameters. When recasting the Ledlow-Owen relation into BH mass versus photoionizing and jet luminosity, we find that the recasted relation describes the sample quite well. The FRI/FRII transition occurs at approximately an order of magnitude lower luminosity relative to the Eddington luminosity than the soft-to-hard transition in X-ray binaries. This difference is consistent with the Ledlow-Owen relation, which predicts a weak BH mass dependence in the transition luminosity.

We show that the resulting \"non-ideal\" cable model can be solved analytically using Fourier transforms.

A strong soft excess below 1 keV is observed in the time-averaged HETG spectrum, which can be parameterized with a steep power law or a thermal model.

A remaining puzzle is the non-detection of rotational modulation of the X-ray emission, despite extensive searches. The situation changed recently with XMM-Newton observations that uncovered 7 s pulsations at the 1% level. By comparing the predictions of our model (which includes simple dipolar-like surface distributions of magnetic field and temperature) with the observed brightness variations, we are able to constrain the geometry of RX J1856.5-3754, with one angle < 6 deg and the other angle = 20-45 deg, though the solutions are not definitive given the observational and model uncertainties. These angles indicate a close alignment between the rotation and magnetic axes or between the rotation axis and the observer.

Each node on the network has fixed dimensionality, while the dimension of the whole network is defined by the total number of nodes. Based on the spectacular properties of data transmission on computer networks, some new concepts of stable and unstable networks differing from the classical Lyapunov stability are defined. In particular, a special unstable network model, called devil network, is introduced and discussed. It is further found that a variety of structures and connection weights affects the network stability substantially. Several criteria on stability, instability, and devil network are established for a rather general class of networks, where some conditions are actually necessary and sufficient.

We test our model on different types of networks, ranging from regular to small world networks, and investigate the impact of the capacity function on the network's dynamics.

Our research proposes a novel approach for characterizing instrumental phase stability, based on the concept of a reference signal. By using a stable reference signal in conjunction with our system, we can compare the phase stability of measurements taken over time. In essence, we take advantage of the fact that the reference signal is not affected by instrumental variations and use it to track the stability of the phase of our measurements.   The key ideas of our methodology involve first establishing a reference signal that remains stable across the time of measurement and then identifying the most suitable measurement parameter that captures phase stability. We then use this parameter to characterize the stability of the measurements.   Our motivation for this work arises from the need to improve the accuracy of measurements in spectroscopy and imaging applications, and our proposed methodology represents a significant step forward in enhancing the accuracy and stability of phase measurements. Ultimately, this research has important implications for a wide range of scientific fields, including physics, biology, and engineering, where high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy are essential.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "arxiv", "source_ID": 704.216}

Our formalism allows for a unified description of the traditional timelike branes/shells together with the signature-changing, or pure null, ones.

In addition, our sample shows a strong correlation between the reflection fraction (R) and Gamma, but we find that it is likely the result of modeling degeneracies.

Motivated by recent theoretical developments that predict a correlation between the X-ray spectral index and the jet/disk dominance in AGN, we analyze archival X-ray spectra of 50 Type 1 AGN from the XMM-Newton and Chandra archives. We show that the X-ray spectral index is indeed a sensitive diagnostic of the jet/disk dominance, as predicted by theoretical models.  Our results demonstrate that the X-ray spectral index provides a simple and efficient tool for distinguishing between jet- and disk-dominated AGN. Specifically, we find that AGN with a steep X-ray spectral index are more likely to be jet-dominated, while AGN with a flat or inverted spectral index are more likely to be disk-dominated. Our study thus opens up new possibilities for studying the jet-disk connection in Active Galactic Nuclei and sheds new light on the physics of AGN accretion and jet launching mechanisms.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "arxiv", "source_ID": 704.1587}

We use a spectral stacking method to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of our observations and to study the average properties of a large sample of LAEs. Our results show that LAEs have strong Ly-alpha emission, consistent with previous observations. We find that the equivalent width of the Ly-alpha line in our sample is significantly higher than in previous studies, which suggests that these LAEs are highly ionized. Moreover, our analysis shows evidence of significant Ly-alpha escape fraction, which indicates that these galaxies could be important sources for reionization.

Our targets are 74 F-M dwarfs in the young stellar associations Eta Cha, TW Hydrae, Beta Pic, and Tuc-Hor, spanning ages from 6 to 30 Myr. While the Halpha EW for most F and G stars are consistent with pure photospheric absorption, most K and M stars show chromospheric emission. By comparing Halpha EW in our sample to results in the literature, we see a clear evolutionary sequence: Chromospheric activity declines steadily from the T Tauri phase to the main sequence. Using activity as an age indicator, we find a plausible age range for the Tuc-Hor association of 10-40 Myr. Between 5 and 30 Myr, we do not see evidence for rotational braking in the total sample, thus angular momentum is conserved, in contrast to younger stars. This difference indicates a change in the rotational regulation at 5-10 Myr, possibly because disk braking cannot operate longer than typical disk lifetimes, allowing the objects to spin up. The rotation-activity relation is flat in our sample; in contrast to main-sequence stars, there is no linear correlation for slow rotators. We argue that this is because young stars generate their magnetic fields in a fundamentally different way from main-sequence stars, and not just the result of a saturated solar-type dynamo. By comparing our rotational velocities with published rotation periods for a subset of stars, we determine ages of 13 (7-20) Myr and 9 (7-17} Myr for the Eta Cha and TWA associations, respectively, consistent with previous estimates.

The model incorporates a feedback and control loop to continuously improve the service as it interacts with the user devices.  The key ideas in our work include the use of multi-layer service provisioning, machine learning-based network optimization, and a feedback responsive communication model. The model's methodology involves collecting data on user interactions with the network and applying machine learning algorithms to optimize the service. The model's output is then communicated back to the network for dynamic adjustment.  In conclusion, our proposed communication model provides a viable solution to the challenges of adaptive service provisioning in hybrid wireless networks. By integrating machine learning with adaptive provisioning, the model provides reliable and responsive service to users while improving wireless network performance.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "arxiv", "source_ID": 706.113}

Next we demonstrate that the same Weyl types characterize warped product spacetimes with a one-dimensional Lorentzian (timelike) factor, whereas warped spacetimes with a two-dimensional Lorentzian factor are restricted to the types D or O. By exploring the Bianchi identities, we then analyze the simplest non-trivial case from the above classes - type D vacuum spacetimes, possibly with a cosmological constant, dropping, however, the assumptions that the spacetime is static, stationary or warped. It is shown that for ``generic'' type D vacuum spacetimes the corresponding principal null directions are geodetic in any dimension (this applies also to type II spacetimes).

In this paper we use the Wisconsin H-alpha Mapper (WHAM) Northern Sky Survey as a tracer of the ionized medium to examine the effect of this foreground component on determination of the CIB. We decompose the DIRBE far infrared data for five high Galactic latitude regions into H I and H-alpha correlated components and a residual component.

Deconvolution and correlation techniques are being employed with a significance down to 1/1000 th of a pixel. HeAr and ThAr lamps are usually used for calibration in low and high resolution spectroscopy, respectively. Unfortunately, the emitted lines typically cover only a small fraction of the spectrometer's spectral range. Furthermore, their exact position depends strongly on environmental conditions. A problem is the strong intensity variation between different (intensity ratios {>300). In addition, the brightness of the lamps is insufficient to illuminate a spectrograph via an integrating sphere, which in turn is important to calibrate a long-slit spectrograph, as this is the only way to assure a uniform illumination of the spectrograph pupil.   Laboratory precision laser spectroscopy has experienced a major advance with the development of optical frequency combs generated by pulsed femto-second lasers. These lasers emit a broad spectrum (several hundred nanometers in the visible and near infra-red) of equally-spaced \"comb\" lines with almost uniform intensity (intensity ratios typically <10). Self-referencing of the laser establishes a precise ruler in frequency space that can be stabilized to the 10e-18 uncertainty level, reaching absolute frequency inaccuracies at the 10e-12 level per day when using the Global Positioning System's (GPS) time signal as the reference.

The existence of radio sources has been shown to correlate with the presence of dense environments, such as clusters, but the nature of their interaction with the surrounding medium is still unclear.  Using multi-wavelength data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the Very Large Array (VLA), we investigate the influence of the cluster environment on 20 radio galaxies. Our work attempts to solve the problem of how the cluster affects the radio emission of these sources and how the energy exchange between the radio jet and the intercluster medium occurs.  Our results show that, in most cases, radio galaxies tend to reside in the denser regions of the cluster, suggesting that cluster merging could trigger the radio activity. Furthermore, we also found that the radio galaxies located in the peripheral regions of the cluster tend to have less powerful radio jets compared to those residing at the center. Our study highlights the importance of environmental effects on the evolution of radio galaxies and provides new insights into the interaction between jets and the surrounding intercluster medium.

For n<=20 we provide simple analytic fitting formulae to describe the non-resonant part of the two-photon emission profiles. Combining these with the analytic form of the cascade-term yields a simple and accurate description of the full two-photon decay spectrum, which only involves a sum over a few intermediate states. We demonstrate that the cascade term naturally leads to a nearly Lorentzian shape of the two-photon profiles in the vicinity of the resonances. However, due to quantum-electrodynamical corrections, the two-photon emission spectra deviate significantly from the Lorentzian shape in the very distant wings of the resonances. We investigate up to which distance the two-photon profiles are close to a Lorentzian and discuss the role of the interference term. We then analyze how the deviation of the two-photon profiles from the Lorentzian shape affects the dynamics of cosmological hydrogen recombination. Since in this context the escape of photons from the Lyman-alpha resonance plays a crucial role, we concentrate on the two-photon corrections in the vicinity of the Lyman-alpha line. Our computations show that the changes in the ionization history due to the additional two-photon process from high shell (n>2) likely do not reach the percent-level. For conservative assumptions we find a correction DN_e/N_e~-0.4% at redshift z~1160.

The mechanical strength of the surface is given only by skeletons, and no two-dimensional bending energy is assumed in the Hamiltonian. The skeletons are composed of elastic linear-chains and rigid junctions and form a compartmentalized structure on the surface, and for this reason the vertices of triangles can diffuse freely only inside the compartments. As a consequence, an inhomogeneous structure is introduced in the model; the surface strength inside the compartments is different from the surface strength on the compartments. However, the rotational symmetry is not influenced by the elastic skeletons; there is no specific direction on the surface.

The accumulated free energy in the corona is abruptly released when the catastrophe takes place, and it probably serves as the main means of energy release for CMEs at least in the initial phase. Such a release proceeds via an ideal MHD process in contrast with nonideal ones such as magnetic reconnection. The catastrophe results in a sudden formation of electric current sheets, which naturally provide proper sites for fast magnetic reconnection. The reconnection may be identified with a solar flare associated with the CME on one hand, and produces a further acceleration of the CME on the other.

We investigate these two energy release processes by simulating a CME with a 3D numerical MHD model.  Our results show that the MHD catastrophe plays a significant role in the initial phase of the CME, during which the magnetic field rapidly expands and accelerates, leading to the ejection of plasma into interplanetary space.

In this example, the nonparametric regression is used to predict a future value of chaotic time series from the present one. The mean predictor error is used in the definition of predictor quality, while the redundancy is expressed by the mean square distance between data points. Both statistics are used in a new definition of predictor cost function. From the minimum of the predictor cost function, a proper number of data in the model is estimated.

To achieve these goals, we utilized a flexible and powerful nonparametric regression technique, which allows us to model complex relationships without limiting the number of parameters. Unlike traditional parametric models, which rely on pre-specified functional forms, nonparametric models can adapt to the data and capture any nonlinearities and interactions.

We compare the spherically symmetric PDR model by Stoerzer, Stutzki & Sternberg (1996) to observations of the three lowest rotational transitions of 12CO, 13CO J = 2-1 and J = 3-2 as well as the [CI] 3P_1-3P_0 fine structure transition. We study the role of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the chemical network of the PDR model and consider the impact of depletion as well as of a variation of the external FUV field. We find it difficult to simultaneously model the observed 12CO and 13CO emission. The 12CO and [CI] emission can be explained by a PDR model with a external FUV field of 1-0.75 chi_0, but this model fails to reproduce the observed 13CO by a factor of ~2. Adding PAHs to the chemical network increases the [CI] emission by 50% in our model but makes [CII] very faint. CO depletion only slightly reduces the 12CO and 13CO line intensity (by <10% and <20%, respectively).

It does not require long-distance freshwater transportation. If seawater is not utilized for increasing its productivity, this inexpensive new method is very environment-friendly.

Taking a general form for the virial theorem, we show that a magnetic field strength of ~15 micro Gauss in SMC clouds could provide additional support to the clouds and explain the difference observed.

Linear stability analysis reveals that below the critical capillary number of entrainment, Ca_c, the contact line is linearly stable at all wavenumbers. Away from the critical point the dispersion relation has an asymptotic behaviour sigma~|q| and compares well to a quasi-static approach. Approaching Ca_c, however, a different mechanism takes over and the dispersion evolves from |q| to the more common q^2.

In the Helfer state, the negative energy density is accompanied by rapidly time-varying energy fluxes. It is the latter feature which allows the quantum inequalities, bounds which restrict the magnitude and duration of negative energy, to hold for this class of states. An observer who initially passes through the negative energy region will quickly encounter fluxes of positive energy which subsequently enter the region. We examine in detail the correlation between the energy density and flux in the Helfer state in terms of their expectation values. We then study the correlation function between energy density and flux in the Minkowski vacuum state, for a massless minimally coupled scalar field in both two and four dimensions. In this latter analysis we examine correlation functions rather than expectation values. Remarkably, we see qualitatively similar behavior to that in the Helfer state. More specifically, an initial negative energy vacuum fluctuation in some region of space is correlated with a subsequent flux fluctuation of positive energy into the region.

For such a strategy, we propose the power efficiency factor to quantify the effect of imperfect beamforming. A formula is proposed to compute the maximum power efficiency factor achievable given a feedback rate. The information rate of the overall MIMO system can be approximated by combining the asymptotic results and the formula for power efficiency factor.

The motivation behind this work is the need to improve the information transfer in wireless communication systems, particularly in the MIMO system where multiple antennas enable higher data rates over a fading channel. The power on/off strategy, which optimizes the transmit power allocation, is used to decrease the interference caused by feedback. However, the use of CSF with limited feedback rates can restrict the amount of information that can be transferred.  Our key idea is to determine the information rate of MIMO systems with finite rate channel state feedback and power on/off strategy.

The Zeeman interaction is extended along the wire and produces gaps in the energy spectrum which allow electron propagation only for spinors lying along a certain direction. For spins in the opposite direction the waves are evanescent far away from the Rashba region, which plays the role of the scattering center. The most interesting case occurs when the magnetic field is perpendicular to the Rashba field. Then, the spins of the asymptotic wavefunctions are not eigenfunctions of the Rashba Hamiltonian and the resulting coupling between spins in the Rashba region gives rise to sudden changes of the transmission probability when the Fermi energy is swept along the gap. After briefly examining the energy spectrum and eigenfunctions of a wire with extended Rashba coupling, we analyze the transmission through a region of localized Rashba interaction, in which a double interface separates a region of constant Rashba interaction from wire leads free from spin-orbit coupling. For energies slightly above the propagation threshold, we find the ubiquitous occurrence of transmission zeros (antiresonances) which are analyzed by matching methods in the one-dimensional limit. We find that a a minimal tight-binding model yields analytical transmission lineshapes of Fano antiresonance type. More general angular dependences of the external magnetic field is treated within projected Schroedinger equations with Hamiltonian matrix elements mixing wavefunction components.

The trend arises because gas pressure support becomes important compared to angular momentum support in small dark matter haloes. We suggest that dwarf galaxies with rotational velocities ~ 40 km/s do not originate as thin discs, but rather are born as thick, puffy systems. If accreted on to larger haloes, tenuous dwarfs of this kind will be more susceptible to gas loss or tidal transformation than scaled-down versions of larger spirals.

Neverthless, the calculated prefactors k0 are found to be relatively uniform across the protein set, with variation in 1/k0 less than a factor of five.

Specifically, we investigate how the excluded volume, or steric hindrance, of a protein's amino acid residues affects the folding process and the cooperativity of local structural changes. This work attempts to solve a fundamental problem in the field of protein folding: understanding the factors that determine the rates at which proteins adopt their native conformations.  To address this problem, we use computer simulations of a minimalist protein model that captures the essential features of the folding process. Our results show that the excluded volume of residues plays a crucial role in both the cooperativity and the rate of structural transitions during folding. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the relationship between excluded volume and folding rate is non-linear, highlighting the importance of considering cooperative effects in protein folding.

We show that the shape and the motion of the filaments does not agree with a purely Keplerian motion of the gas in the potential of the supermassive black hole at the position of SgrA*. Therefore, additional mechanisms must be responsible for their formation and motion.

A comparison of the X-ray flux observed from this source between 1980 and 2006 reveals that its absorbed 0.5-10 keV X-ray flux decreased from ~2x10^-12 ergs cm-2 s-1 to ~3x10^-13 ergs cm-2 during this period.

We examine the spatial distribution of turn-off stars and demonstrate that all belong to NGC 1846 rather than to any field star population. In addition, the spatial distributions of the two sets of turn-off stars may exhibit different central concentrations and some asymmetries. By fitting isochrones, we show that the properties of the colour-magnitude diagram can be explained if there are two stellar populations of equivalent metal abundance in NGC 1846, differing in age by approximately 300 Myr.

The metal abundance inferred from isochrone fitting is [M/H] ~ -0.40, consistent with spectroscopic measurements of [Fe/H]. We propose that the observed properties of NGC 1846 can be explained if this object originated via the tidal capture of two star clusters formed separately in a star cluster group in a single giant molecular cloud.

An examination of the distribution of semi-major axes shows that there is a clear excess of planets with orbital periods around 3 or 4 days, corresponding to a~0.03$ AU, with a sharp cutoff at shorter periods (see Figure 1). It is believed that Jupiter mass planets form at large distances from their parent stars; some fraction then migrate in to produce the short period objects. We argue that a significant fraction of the `hot Jupiters' (a<0.1 AU) may arise in binary star systems in which the orbit of the binary is highly inclined to the orbit of the planet. Mutual torques between the two orbits drive down the minimum separation or periapse r_p between the planet and its host star (the Kozai mechanism). This periapse collapse is halted when tidal friction on the planet circularizes the orbit faster than Kozai torque can excite it. The same friction then circularizes the planet orbit, producing hot Jupiters with the peak of the semimajor axis distribution lying around 3 days. For the observed distributions of binary separation, eccentricity and mass ratio, roughly 2.5% of planets with initial semimajor axis a_p ~ 5au will migrate to within 0.1au of their parent star.

Our study provides evidence that the black-body component is present in the GRB spectra, which indicates that thermal emission plays a significant role in the observed radiation.  The results obtained from our analysis suggest that the thermal component present in the GRB spectra is consistent with emission from the jet photosphere. Our findings provide new insight into the physical mechanisms taking place in GRBs and challenge the current understanding of their emission mechanisms. The discovery of the black-body component opens up new avenues for studying the properties of GRBs, and it has significant implications for the field of astrophysics.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "arxiv", "source_ID": 704.3438}

The Yarkovsky effect is a force that influences the orbit of asteroids by causing a drift in their trajectory due to the uneven heating and cooling of their surfaces. The thermal inertia, or the ability of an object to retain and release heat, is a crucial factor in determining the strength of the Yarkovsky effect.   We utilized thermal emission measurements from the NEOWISE space telescope to calculate the thermal inertia values of 25 near-Earth asteroids. We then modeled the asteroid orbits and compared the observed deviations in their orbits to the predicted values based on the Yarkovsky effect.   Our analysis revealed that the thermal inertia values of near-Earth asteroids vary widely, with some asteroids exhibiting significantly higher values than expected. This suggests that the Yarkovsky effect may be stronger in these asteroids than previously thought. We also found that the strength of the Yarkovsky effect is highly dependent on the asteroid size and surface properties.   These findings will help us better understand the behavior of near-Earth asteroids and their potential impact on our planet.

Using observed abundance ratios of light nuclei such as Li, Be, and B, we constructed theoretical models of nucleosynthesis processes in globular cluster environments.

This volume formula holds for Grassmann manifolds with arbitrary n, p, q and L, while previous results pertained only to some special cases. Based on this volume formula, several bounds are derived for the rate distortion tradeoff assuming the quantization rate is sufficiently high. The lower and upper bounds on the distortion rate function are asymptotically identical, and so precisely quantify the asymptotic rate distortion tradeoff. We also show that random codes are asymptotically optimal in the sense that they achieve the minimum achievable distortion with probability one as n and the code rate approach infinity linearly. Finally, we discuss some applications of the derived results to communication theory.

Recently, several groups have found no evidence for convergence of the inner halo profile to a constant power law. The choice of a split power law parameterization used in this letter is motivated by the need to compare our results to previous ones and is formally valid because we are not able to resolve regions where the slope of the fitting function reaches its asymptotic constant value.

The non-adiabatic behavior manifests itself in a twofold way, viz. by the over-reflection of the GAWs and by the generation of GAWs from EM perturbations. It is shown that these phenomena act as efficient transformers of the equilibrium flow energy into the energy of the perturbations for moderate and high shearing rate solar plasma flows.

In this paper, we take the wisdom that the cosmological QCD phase transition, which happened at a time between 10^(-5) sec and 10^(-4) sec or at the temperature of about 150 MeV and accounts for confinement of quarks and gluons to within hadrons, would be of first order.

We examine how and when \"pasted\" or \"patched\" domain walls are formed, how long such walls evolve in the long run, and we believe that the significant portion of dark matter could be accounted for in terms of such domain-wall structure and its remnants. Of course, the cosmological QCD phase transition happened in the way such that the false vacua associated with baryons and many other color-singlet objects did not disappear (that is, using the bag-model language, there are bags of radius 1.0 fermi for the baryons) - but the amount of the energy remained in the false vacua is negligible. The latent energy released due to the conversion of the false vacua to the true vacua, in the form of \"pasted\" or \"patched\" domain walls in the short run and their numerous evolved objects, should make the concept of the \"radiation-dominated\" epoch, or of the \"matter-dominated\" epoch to be re-examined.

Such a cored stellar density profile leads to more unstable CN disks than the power-law density profile characteristic of less massive galaxies. However, the more massive BHs in high-mass galaxies act to stabilize the CN disk. Our results demonstrate that the gravitational potentials of both the central BH and the stellar component should be taken into account when studying the properties of CN disks, as their stability is sensitive to both the BH mass and the stellar density profile. Our results could explain the observed trend that less luminous ellipticals have a greater tendency to exhibit ongoing SF than giant ellipticals.

We use a two-dimensional hydrodynamical code to simulate the disks evolution under different initial conditions, such as different surface mass densities and rotation curves.   Our main result reveals that circumnuclear disks in elliptical galaxies are generally unstable against gravitational collapse, except for a narrow range of surface mass densities. We also find that rotation plays a crucial role in stabilizing the disks, by introducing centrifugal forces that oppose the inward gravitational pull. Additionally, we confirm that the disks are subject to the swing amplification instability, which can enhance non-axisymmetric perturbations, leading to the formation of spiral arms.

Examining the radial dependence of their stellar populations, we find no significant velocity dispersion, age, or alpha-enhancement gradients. However, we find a wide range of metallicity gradients, suggesting a variety of formation mechanisms. The range of metallicity gradients observed is surprising given the homogeneous environment these galaxies probe and their uniform central stellar populations.

Using data from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA) survey, we analyzed the kinematics and stellar populations of 113 brightest cluster galaxies and 64 brightest group galaxies, spanning a range of redshifts and environments. Our study revealed that both cluster and group brightest galaxies exhibit complex kinematic structures, including rotation, dispersion, and streaming motions. Furthermore, we found that the stellar populations of these galaxies show clear gradients in age, metallicity, and abundance ratios, with the central regions being more metal-rich and enriched with alpha-elements.  The key idea behind this study is to understand the formation and evolution of brightest cluster and group galaxies by exploring their kinematic and stellar properties in detail. To achieve this, we employed a state-of-the-art kinematic model, combined with spectral fitting techniques, to extract the relevant parameters from the MaNGA data.

We examine its nature and surroundings by analyzing the projected galaxy distribution, the galaxy velocity distribution, the weak-lensing mass reconstruction, and the X-ray spectroscopy and imaging. The cluster shows a complex morphology. It is composed by at least two structures along the line-of-sight, with velocity dispersions of 592+-82 km s^-1 and 391+-85 km s^-1 respectively. Other structures are also detected in X-ray, in the galaxy projected number density map, and by weak-lensing. One of these clumps, could be gravitationally bound and associated to the main cluster.

We find that the mass determination inferred from weak-lensing is in average 3 to 4.8 times higher (depending on the model assumed) than the X-ray mass. We have two possible explanations for this discrepancy: i) the cluster is in non-equilibrium, then the deviation of the X-ray estimated mass from the true value can be as high as a factor of two; ii) the intervening mass along the line-of-sight of the cluster is producing an over-estimation of the weak-lensing mass.

We emphasize that creation plays very crucial role in cosmology and provides a natural explanation to the various explosive phenomena occurring in local (z<0.1) and extra galactic universe. We exemplify this point of view by considering the resurrected version of this theory - the quasi-steady state theory, which tries to relate creation events directly to the large scale dynamics of the universe and supplies more natural explanations of the observed phenomena.

This energy then generates a repulsive gravitational force that counteracts attractive gravity and causes the observed acceleration of the universe's expansion.

Experiments with entangled pairs of particles have amply confirmed these quantum predictions, thus rendering local realistic theories untenable. Maintaining realism as a fundamental concept would therefore necessitate the introduction of 'spooky' actions that defy locality.

In the experiment, we measure previously untested correlations between two entangled photons, and show that these correlations violate an inequality proposed by Leggett for non-local realistic theories.

Sampling is commonly applied on routers in order to limit the load incurred by the collection of information that the router has to undertake when evaluating flow information for monitoring purposes. The sampling process in nearly all cases is a deterministic process of choosing 1 in every N packets on a per-interface basis, and then forming the flow statistics based on the collected sampled statistics. Even though this sampling may not be significant for some statistics, such as packet rate, others can be severely distorted. However, it is important to consider the sampling techniques and their relative accuracy when applied to different traffic patterns. The main disadvantage of sampling is the loss of accuracy in the collected trace when compared to the original traffic stream. To date there has not been a detailed analysis of the impact of sampling at a router in various traffic profiles and flow criteria.

The data therefore provide no compelling evidence for undetected baryonic components, particularly any that vary in importance with cluster mass. A unique feature of the current analysis is direct inclusion of the contribution of intracluster light (ICL) in the baryon budget. The increase in X-ray gas mass fraction with increasing total mass is entirely accounted for by a decrease in the total stellar mass fraction, supporting the argument that the behavior of both the stellar and X-ray gas components is dominated by a decrease in star formation efficiency in more massive environments. Within just the stellar component, the fraction of the total stellar luminosity in the BCG and ICL decreases as velocity dispersion increases, suggesting that the BCG+ICL component, and in particular the dominant ICL component, grows less efficiently in higher mass environments.

At the cellular level, such adjustment relies on the transcription factors (TFs) which must rapidly find their target sequences amidst a vast amount of non-relevant sequences on DNA molecules. Whether these transcription factors locate their target sites through a 1D or 3D pathway is still a matter of speculation. It has been suggested that the optimum search time is when the protein equally shares its search time between 1D and 3D diffusions. In this paper, we study the above problem using a Monte Carlo simulation by considering a very simple physical model. A 1D strip, representing a DNA, with a number of low affinity sites, corresponding to non-target sites, and high affinity sites, corresponding to target sites, is considered and later extended to a 2D strip. We study the 1D and 3D exploration pathways, and combinations of the two modes by considering three different types of molecules: a walker that randomly walks along the strip with no dissociation; a jumper that represents dissociation and then re-association of a TF with the strip at later time at a distant site; and a hopper that is similar to the jumper but it dissociates and then re-associates at a faster rate than the jumper. We analyze the final probability distribution of molecules for each case and find that TFs can locate their targets fast enough even if they spend 15% of their search time diffusing freely in the solution.

Some remarkable flares are observed with fluence comparable to the prompt GRB fluence. Many GRBs have several flares, which are sometimes overlapping. Short, intense, repetitive, and late flaring can be most easily understood within the context of the standard fireball model with the internal engine that powers the prompt GRB emission in an active state at late times. However, other models for flares have been proposed. Flare origin can be investigated by comparing the flare spectra to that of the afterglow and the initial prompt emission. In this work, we have analyzed all significant X-ray flares from the first 110 GRBs observed by Swift. From this sample 33 GRBs were found to have significant X-ray flares, with 77 flares that were detected above the 3$\\sigma$ level. In addition to temporal analysis presented in a companion paper, a variety of spectral models have been fit to each flare.

The primary objective of this study is to explore the infrared emission of these remnants and to provide a more detailed understanding of the physical conditions of the gas and dust within them. The observed emission lines cover a range of excitation potentials, from [Ne II] at 12.8um to [O IV] at 25.9um.  To analyze the spectral data, we employ principal component analysis (PCA) to identify the underlying physical processes responsible for the observed line emission. PCA reveals distinct components for each SNR, with each component corresponding to specific emission lines that are likely produced by a particular physical process. Our PCA analysis indicates that the dominant physical mechanisms in the SNRs include shocks, radiative excitation, photoionization, and photon heating.  This work presents an important step forward in our understanding of the physical conditions of SNRs and highlights the power of PCA as a method to interpret complex spectral line data. The detailed information provided by this technique enables us to better quantify the energy input and output in these objects, and to constrain models of SNR evolution. The results of this study will inform future observational and theoretical efforts in the field of supernova remnants and their impact on the interstellar medium.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "arxiv", "source_ID": 704.2179}

In this extended abstract we study the non-linear functional equation P(z)=Q(y(z)), where y(z) is restricted to be analytic in a neighborhood of z=0. We provide sufficient conditions to ensure that all the roots of Q(y) are contained within the range of y(z) as well as to have y(z)=z as the unique analytic solution of the non-linear equation. Our results are motivated from uniqueness considerations of polynomial canonical representations of the phase or amplitude terms of oscillatory integrals encountered in the asymptotic analysis of the coefficients of mixed powers and multivariable generating functions via saddle-point methods. Uniqueness shall prove important for developing algorithms to determine the Taylor coefficients of the terms appearing in these representations. The uniqueness of Levinson's polynomial canonical representations of analytic functions in several variables follows as a corollary of our one-complex variables results. ", "machine_text": "In this work, we investigate the uniqueness of polynomial canonical representations in algebraic geometry. Our study departs from the long-standing problem of finding a constructive and universally accepted method of representing a polynomial, which is capable of reflecting both the properties of the root and the invariance of the polynomial's formulation under particular transformations.  We adopt a systematic approach that enables us to establish the existence and uniqueness of canonical representations of polynomials that are determined by specific modules. Using this methodology, we prove that two distinct polynomials have different canonical representations if and only if they are non-isomorphic in the associated module. Additionally, we provide algorithmic procedures that can be used to compute the canonical forms of polynomials, which gives us a concrete solution to the problem.  Our motivation for this research is primarily driven by the need to explore more effective and efficient ways of representing polynomials in algebraic geometry. The use of canonical representations has significant implications for decision-making algorithms and can simplify calculations of invariants such as Hilbert polynomials. Our study provides a formal and scientific perspective on the uniqueness of polynomial canonical representations. Our work significantly contributes to the field of algebraic geometry by providing an innovative approach to the problem of polynomial representation that has both theoretical and practical benefits.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "arxiv", "source_ID": 705.2345}

However, in many situations, such as a star formed at the edge of a molecular cloud core, an offset power-law density distribution would be more appropriate. In this paper a few of the main issues of the formation and expansion of HII regions in such media are outlined and results are presented for the particular cases where the underlying power laws are 1/r^2 and 1/r^3. A simple criterion is developed for determining whether the initial photoionized region will be unbounded, which depends on the power-law exponent and the ratio of the equivalent Stroemgren radius produced by the star in a uniform medium to the stellar offset distance. In the expansion stage, the ionized volumes will eventually become unbounded unless pressure balance with the external medium is reached before the ionization front velocity becomes supersonic with respect to the ionized gas. ", "machine_text": "In this study, we investigate the properties of off-center HII regions in power-law density distributions in order to better understand the mechanisms behind star formation in these environments. Our methodology involves performing numerical simulations using the adaptive mesh refinement code FLASH, which accounts for the effects of radiative transfer and gas dynamics on the evolution of HII regions. We explore the effects of various initial conditions such as the position and power-law slope of the density peak as well as the strength of the ionizing radiation source. Our results suggest that off-center HII regions tend to have longer lifetimes and more complex dynamics compared to their centered counterparts. We also find that the shape and position of the HII region can have a significant impact on the surrounding gas distribution, leading to the formation of secondary dense clumps and filaments. Our analysis sheds light on the potential role of off-center HII regions in triggering star formation in their surroundings, highlighting the importance of accounting for the effects of off-center ionization sources in simulations of star-forming regions.
