If this is the case then the speed of light, in fact any speed, must decrease inversely proportional to this age. The immediate consequence is that energy is not conserved: the hypothesis that time is a homogeneous property implies conservation of energy (the theorem of Noether). Nonconservation of energy follows from the condition that any time interval is proportional to the cosmological time, and therefore time can not be homogeneous. From the uncertainty principle, taking the constant of Planck as a real constant, time independent, it follows that any energy in the Universe decreases linearly with time. We then prove that Schroedinger equation does not change, except for the potential energy term. The future of the Universe gives for the wave functions a long sinusoidal spatial solution, so that everything becomes unlocalized. The relativistic absolute interval remains the same, even with a changing speed of light, and the Universe turns out to be nonexpanding. A Mass-Boom effect is confirmed.

To address this problem, we consider the fate of dark energy and the quantum treatment of gravity.   Our results suggest that a \"big crunch\" is highly unlikely and that dark energy will continue to drive the accelerated expansion of the universe. Moreover, our quantum treatment of gravity indicates that gravity itself may become unstable at a certain energy scale, implying the potential for new physics and the eventual breakdown of our current understanding of the universe.

As a consequence, with the lowering of temperature, there can occur a transition from a Wigner crystal charge-ordered state to a spin-Peierls state that is a Bond-Charge-Density Wave with charge occupancies different from the Wigner crystal. This transition is possible because spin excitations from the spin-Peierls state in the 1/4-filled band are necessarily accompanied by changes in site charge densities.

Our main goal is to statistically characterize the flare-like variability of 165 low mass (0.1-0.3 M_sun) ONC members in order to test and constrain the physical scenario in which flares explain all the observed emission. Methods. We adopt a maximum likelihood piece-wise representation of the observed X-ray light curves and detect flares by taking into account both the amplitude and time derivative of the count-rate. We then derive the frequency and energy distribution of the flares. Results. The high energy tail of the energy distribution of flares is well described by a power-law with index 2.2. We test the hypothesis that light curves are built entirely by overlapping flares with a single power law energy distribution. We constrain the parameters of this simple model for every single light curve. The analysis of synthetic light curves obtained from the model indicates a good agreement with the observed data. Comparing low mass stars with stars in the mass interval (0.9-1.2M_sun), we establish that, at ~1 Myr, low mass and solar mass stars of similar X-ray luminosity have very similar flare frequencies.

Using a fully 3-d and energy-conserving code, we compute the structure and energy balance of this disk segment over a span of more than forty cooling times. As is also true when gas pressure dominates, the disk's upper atmosphere is magnetically-supported. However, unlike the gas-dominated case, no steady-state is reached; instead, the total (i.e., radiation plus gas) energy content fluctuates by factors of 3--4 over timescales of several tens of orbits, with no secular trend. Because the radiation pressure varies much more than the gas pressure, the ratio of radiation pressure to gas pressure varies over the approximate range 0.5--2. The volume-integrated dissipation rate generally increases with increasing total energy, but the mean trend is somewhat slower than linear, and the instantaneous dissipation rate is often a factor of two larger or smaller than the mean for that total energy level. Locally, the dissipation rate per unit volume scales approximately in proportion to the current density; the time-average dissipation rate per unit mass is proportional to m^{-1/2}, where m is the horizontally-averaged mass column density to the nearer of the top or bottom surface.

This supports a previous detection of an excess of kurtosis in the wavelet coefficient of the WMAP data with the axisymmetric Mexican hat wavelet (Vielva et al. 2004). Instrumental noise and foreground emissions are not likely to be at the origin of the excess of kurtosis. Large-scale modulations of the CMB related to some unknown systematics are rejected as possible origins of the detection. The observed non-Gaussianity may therefore probably be imputed to the CMB itself, thereby questioning the basic inflationary scenario upon which the present concordance cosmological model relies.

We analytically demonstrate that the low radio loudness of non-BCG galaxies within SSC-CR clusters cannot be explained by direct major galaxy mergers or rapid galaxy flyby collisions, but by the loss of gas supply through the enhanced ram pressure felt when these galaxies cross the shock front between the 2 merging clusters and are later subjected to the stronger wind from the 2nd cluster.

We selected all clusters that were known to be mergers or suggested to be so, based on X-ray and/or optical data. We compared the radio measurements of galaxies in the merging clusters with those from galaxies in non-merging systems.

Although the evolution of some GRB afterglows is consistent with expansion into a free wind, there is also good evidence for expansion into a constant density medium. The evidence includes the evolution of X-ray afterglows (when X-rays are below the cooling frequency), the evolution of the pre-jet break optical and X-ray afterglow, and the sharp turn-on observed for some afterglows. Recent observations of short bursts, which are expected to be interacting with a constant density medium, provide a check on the standard afterglow model. Although radio observations do not support the constant density model for long bursts in some cases, the evidence for constant density interaction is strong. The most plausible way to produce such a medium around a massive star is to shock the progenitor wind. This requires a smaller termination shock than would be expected, possibly due to a high pressure surroundings, a high progenitor velocity, or the particular evolution leading to a GRB. However, the need for the termination shock near the deceleration radius cannot be plausibly accomodated and may indicate that some long bursts have compact binary progenitors and explode directly into the interstellar medium.

Usually this issue is addressed in the inflationary context, but trans-Planckian reasoning is much broader. We examine this logic in a simple example of scalar quantum field theory in the expanding and contracting Milne universes, where wavelengths of the eigenmodes are red- or blue-shifted. Trans-Planckian modifications of QFT should result in a UV-dependent VeV of the energy momentum tensor of a scalar field in the Milne universe. On the other hand, the Milne universe is another coordinate systems of flat Minkowski space-time, and the covariant energy momentum tensor should be the same (but vacuum-dependent) in different coordinates of flat space time. We explicitly demonstrate that in conventional QFT the energy momentum tensor, choosing the adiabatic vacuum, is identical to zero in Minkowski coordinates, and remains zero in the contracting Milne universe (due to non-trivial cancellations of contributions from particles which appear in the accelerating frame and from vacuum polarization there). In contrast to this, the trans-Planckian modification of the energy momentum tensor is not motivated. We provide a similar argument for the expanding Milne universe, where the energy momentum tensor in the conformal vacuum is non-zero.

The primary objective of our study is to improve neutrino oscillation measurements, which rely on accurately determining the direction of incident neutrinos.  To accomplish this, we utilize Monte Carlo simulations to generate quasi-elastic events and compare the direction of the incident neutrinos to the true direction. We evaluated the performance of several analysis techniques, such as the use of reconstructed or truth information about the direction of the recoil proton and the use of multiple scattering measurements.  Our results show that the direction of incident neutrinos can be reliably determined in fully contained quasi-elastic events with an angular resolution of less than one degree. However, in partially contained events, where a fraction of the event energy escapes the detector, the direction reconstruction becomes increasingly challenging due to poor event topology.

First, at the clustering transition, the entropically dominant part of the phase space decomposes into an exponential number of pure states so that beyond this transition a uniform sampling of solutions becomes hard. Afterward, the space of solutions condenses over a finite number of the largest states and consequently the total entropy of solutions becomes smaller than the annealed one.

Its measurement is difficult in field conditions. Vibration-induced conductivity fluctuation was investigated to quantify soil bulk density with possible field applications in the future. The AC electrical conductivity of soil was measured using a pair of blade-like electrodes while exposing the soil to periodic vibration. The blades were positioned longitudinally and transversally to the direction of the induced vibration to enable the calculation of a normalized index. The normalized index was expected to provide data independent from the vibration strength and to reduce the effect of soil salinity and water content. The experiment was conducted on natural and salinized fine sand at two moisture conditions and four bulk densities. The blade-shaped electrodes improved electrode-soil contact compared to cylindrical electrodes, and thereby, reduced measurement noise. Simulations on a simplified resistor lattice indicate that the transversal effect increases as soil bulk density decreases. Measurement of dry sand showed a negative correlation between the normalized conductivity fluctuation and soil bulk density for both longitudinal and transversal settings.

We try to figure out its place among the variable B stars on the upper Main Sequence. In order to obtain additional information on physical parameters we collected a few spectra with the ELODIE and FIES instruments. We searched for frequencies in the uvby passbands using 2 different frequency analysis methods and used the S/N>4 criterion to select the significant periodicities. We obtained an estimate of the physical parameters of the underlying B star of spectral type between B5 and B7, by correcting for the presence of a circumstellar disk, using a formalism based on the strenght of the Halpha line emission. We detected 3 independent frequencies with amplitudes below 0.01mag, f1 = 4.7126 c/d, f2 = 2.2342 c/d and f3 = 4.671 c/d, and discovered that V2104Cyg is a Be star.

The motivation for this work stems from the fact that Be stars have long been known to exhibit complex variability, both in terms of their spectral lines and their photometric light curves. However, until recently, few tools were available to systematically detect and characterize such variability, particularly in the case of mid-late Be stars. Our work addresses this issue by utilizing Fourier analysis techniques to identify and quantify periodic variations in the spectral lines and photometry of V2104 Cygni.  Our results reveal the presence of multiple periodicities in both the photometry and spectral lines of V2104 Cygni. Specifically, we find two dominant frequencies in the photometry, along with two additional frequencies that are weaker. Similarly, spectral line variations show three dominant frequencies. Our analysis also reveals a possible connection between the spectral line and photometric variability, which is consistent with the idea of a pulsation-driven disk instability as the mechanism behind Be star variability.  In conclusion, the work presented here provides evidence for multiperiodicity in a newly discovered mid-late Be star, which has implications for our understanding of the physical mechanisms that drive variability in these objects.

But this is deceptive. As we show by explicit calculation, although the relevant quantities are simultaneously measurable, they develop non-vanishing commutators when calculated back to the time of escape of the photon. This justifies Bohr's qualitative arguments in a precise way; and it illustrates how the details of the dynamics conspire to guarantee the requirements of complementarity.

The minimum mass is approximately proportional to $\\dot M^{0.48} \\alpha^{0.8} M_*^{0.42} L_*^{-0.08}$. This estimate can be used to rule out the presence of massive planets in gapless accretion disks. We identify two radii at which an inwardly migrating planet may become able to open a gap and so slow its migration; the radius at which the heating from viscous dissipation is similar to that from stellar radiation in a flared disk, and the radius at which the disk has optical depth order 1 in a self-shadowed disk. If a gap opening planet cuts off disk accretion allowing the formation of a central hole or clearing in the disk then we would estimate that the clearing radius would approximately be proportional to the stellar mass.

This problem is crucial for understanding planet formation and disk evolution. The presence of a planet can create a gap in the disk material, and the resulting flow of gas and dust can affect the planet growth, migration, and atmospheric properties. The gap-opening criterion depends on the planet mass, disk properties, and irradiation by the central star. Previous studies have generally assumed a static, non-irradiated disk, whereas observations suggest that most disks are irradiated and can exhibit significant dynamical instabilities.  To address this issue, we use 2D hydrodynamic simulations that include irradiation by a central star and the cooling and heating effects. We vary the planet mass, disk viscosity, temperature, and irradiation strength to identify the critical minimum mass that can produce a gap. We find that the gap-opening mass increases with irradiation strength and decreases with disk viscosity and temperature. Our results indicate that the minimum mass can be lower than previously thought, especially for disks with strong irradiation and low viscosity.

Over a period of three months, the Cassini Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) observed a dramatic variation in the average torus composition. Superimposed on this long-term variation, is a 10.07-hour periodicity caused by an azimuthal variation in plasma composition subcorotating relative to System III longitude. Quite surprisingly, the amplitude of the azimuthal variation appears to be modulated at the beat frequency between the System III period and the observed 10.07-hour period. Previously, we have successfully modeled the months-long compositional change by supposing a factor of three increase in the amount of material supplied to Io's extended neutral clouds. Here, we extend our torus chemistry model to include an azimuthal dimension. We postulate the existence of two azimuthal variations in the number of super-thermal electrons in the torus: a primary variation that subcorotates with a period of 10.07 hours and a secondary variation that remains fixed in System III longitude. Using these two hot electron variations, our model can reproduce the observed temporal and azimuthal variations observed by Cassini UVIS.

In this context, the UVIS instrument onboard the Cassini spacecraft has provided a long-term dataset with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution of the torus emissions. The complex variability of the torus, including changes in its shape, brightness, and composition, poses a challenge for theoretical modeling. We address this challenge by improving a previously developed statistical model that combines a ring current simulation with the UVIS observational constraints.

Assuming that dark matter is composed primarily of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), a star orbiting close enough to the SMBH can capture WIMPs at an extremely high rate. The stellar luminosity due to annihilation of captured WIMPs in the stellar core may be comparable to or even exceed the luminosity of the star due to thermonuclear burning. The model thus predicts the existence of unusual stars, i.e. \"WIMP burners\", in the vicinity of an adiabatically grown SMBH. We find that the most efficient WIMP burners are stars with degenerate electron cores, e.g. white dwarfs (WD) or degenerate cores with envelopes. If found, such stars would provide evidence for the existence of particle dark matter and could possibly be used to establish its density profile. In our previous paper we computed the luminosity from WIMP burning for a range of dark matter spike density profiles, degenerate core masses, and distances from the SMBH. Here we compare our results with the observed stars closest to the Galactic center and find that they could be consistent with WIMP burners in the form of degenerate cores with envelopes. We also cross-check the WIMP burner hypothesis with the EGRET observed flux of gamma-rays from the Galactic center, which imposes a constraint on the dark matter spike density profile and annihilation cross-section. We find that the EGRET data is consistent with the WIMP burner hypothesis.

Our approach also leads to the emergence of new geometric and algebraic properties of the Lorentz group, such as the existence of invariants that are independent of the choice of basis.   The motivation for our research stems from the desire to gain a deeper understanding of the fundamental principles of special relativity. The Lorentz transformations provide the key mathematical framework for this theory, but their full potential has not been fully explored in the literature. Our work takes a fresh look at this topic, examining the structure of Lorentz transformations from a new perspective.   Our methodology involves a combination of mathematical analysis, geometric reasoning, and physical intuition. We provide rigorous proofs of our results, while also appealing to visual representations to deepen our understanding of the geometric relationships that govern these transformations.

The phase-separation is modeled through a non-autonomous Cahn-Hilliard equation whose spinodal is determined by the evolving guiding field. Control over the dynamics of the spinodal gives control over the velocity of the instability front which separates the stable and unstable regions of the system. Since the wavelength of the pattern is largely determined by this velocity, the distance between successive precipitation bands becomes controllable. We demonstrate the above ideas by numerical studies of a 1D system with diffusive guiding field. We find that the results can be accurately described by employing a linear stability analysis (pulled-front theory) for determining the velocity -- local-wavelength relationship. From the perspective of the Liesegang theory, our results indicate that the so-called revert patterns may be naturally generated by diffusive guiding fields.

The one-loop effective potential for the volume modulus has a form which is very similar to Coleman-Weinberg potential. We evaluate coefficients appearing in the effective potential by employing zeta function regularization and heat kernel analysis. The volume modulus is stabilized for smaller degrees of warping, below a critical value, which depends on deficit angle of the reference brane. After stabilizing the modulus, it is possible to obtain observed values of the mass ratio between the fundamental energy scales and a tiny effective cosmological constant (though its sign is negative).

This allows us to take invariant cohomological classes and under the right circumstances construct unique currents of a given type, including unique measures of a given type, that represent those classes and are invariant under pullback. A dynamically interesting self map may have a plethora of invariant measures, so the uniquess of the constructed currents is important.

Because we use subsheaves of the sheaf of currents we give conditions under which a subsheaf will have the same cohomology as the sheaf containing it.

The created pairs can upscatter background photons to high energies, which in turn may pair produce, thereby initiating a cascade. The pairs diffuse on the extragalactic magnetic field (EMF) and cascade emission has been suggested as a means for measuring its intensity. Limits on the IR background and EMF are reconsidered taking into account cascade emissions. The cascade equations are solved numerically. Assuming a power-law intrinsic spectrum, the observed 100 MeV - 100 TeV spectrum is found as a function of the intrinsic spectral index and the intensity of the EMF. Cascades emit mainly at or below 100 GeV. The observed TeV spectrum appears softer than for pure absorption when cascade emission is taken into account. The upper limit on the IR photon background is found to be robust. Inversely, the intrinsic spectra needed to fit the TeV data are uncomfortably hard when cascade emission makes a significant contribution to the observed spectrum.

In contrast to its fermionic counterpart the construction of the B-DMFT requires different scalings of the hopping amplitudes with Z depending on whether the bosons are in their normal state or in the Bose-Einstein condensate. A detailed discussion of how this conceptual problem can be overcome by performing the scaling in the action rather than in the Hamiltonian itself is presented.

By understanding the properties and behavior of LRGs in clusters at different redshifts, we can gain insight into how the cluster environment affects galaxy evolution.   We used data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) to identify galaxy clusters in the target redshift range and to select samples of LRGs and other galaxies in these clusters. We then analyzed the clustering properties of these samples, using a two-point correlation function.   Our results indicate that LRGs in clusters at $0.2\\leq z\\leq 0.6$ are more strongly clustered than other galaxy types in the same clusters. This finding is consistent with previous studies and suggests that LRGs are more likely to reside in the centers of clusters. However, we also find that the clustering bias of LRGs in these clusters is weaker than that of LRGs in nearby clusters. This may be due to environmental effects on the evolution of LRGs in cluster environments at different redshifts.   Overall, our study provides insight into the evolution of LRG populations in clusters over cosmic time and highlights the importance of investigating the clustering properties of galaxy populations in different environments.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "arxiv", "source_ID": 706.0727}

Linear tabling is a framework from which different methods can be derived based on the strategies used in handling looping subgoals. One decision concerns when answers are consumed and returned. This paper describes two strategies, namely, {\\it lazy} and {\\it eager} strategies, and compares them both qualitatively and quantitatively. The results indicate that, while the lazy strategy has good locality and is well suited for finding all solutions, the eager strategy is comparable in speed with the lazy strategy and is well suited for programs with cuts. Linear tabling relies on depth-first iterative deepening rather than suspension to compute fixpoints. Each cluster of inter-dependent subgoals as represented by a top-most looping subgoal is iteratively evaluated until no subgoal in it can produce any new answers. Naive re-evaluation of all looping subgoals, albeit simple, may be computationally unacceptable. In this paper, we also introduce semi-naive optimization, an effective technique employed in bottom-up evaluation of logic programs to avoid redundant joins of answers, into linear tabling. We give the conditions for the technique to be safe (i.e. sound and complete) and propose an optimization technique called {\\it early answer promotion} to enhance its effectiveness. Benchmarking in B-Prolog demonstrates that with this optimization linear tabling compares favorably well in speed with the state-of-the-art implementation of SLG.

Our motivation for this research stems from the fact that tabling is commonly used to compute recursive and mutually recursive predicates, but its efficiency can be significantly impacted by the size and complexity of the table. Therefore, we seek to optimize the tabling mechanism by reducing the number of calls made to the table, while preserving the correctness of the computations.

For parameters relevant to the oligarchic stage of planet formation, dynamical friction keeps the typical eccentricities small and prevents orbit crossing. Interactions at impact parameters greater than several Hill radii cause the protoplanets to repel each other; if the impact parameter is instead much less than the Hill radius, the protoplanets shift slightly in semi-major axis but remain otherwise unperturbed. If the orbits of two or more protoplanets are separated by less than a Hill radius, they are each pushed towards an equilibrium spacing between their neighbors and can exist as a stable co-orbital system. In the shear-dominated oligarchic phase of planet formation we show that the feeding zones contain several oligarchs instead of only one. Growth of the protoplanets in the oligarchic phase drives the disk to an equilibrium configuration that depends on the mass ratio of protoplanets to planetesimals, $\\Sigma/\\sigma$. Early in the oligarchic phase, when $\\Sigma/\\sigma$ is low, the spacing between rows of co-orbital oligarchs are about 5 Hill radii wide, rather than the 10 Hill radii cited in the literature. It is likely that at the end of oligarchy the average number of co-orbital oligarchs is greater than unity. In the outer solar system this raises the disk mass required to form the ice giants. In the inner solar system this lowers the mass of the final oligarchs and requires more giant impacts than previously estimated.

The latter is an analytical model in which the viscous torque is assumed to vanish at the ISCO. We consider the implications of the results for attempts to estimate black hole spin by using the standard disk model to fit continuum spectra of black hole accretion disks. We find that the error in the spin estimate is quite modest so long as H/R < 0.1 and alpha < 0.2. At worst the error in the estimated value of the spin parameter is 0.1 for a non-spinning black hole; the error is much less for a rapidly spinning hole.

The contrast needs to be large if black hole spin is to be successfully estimated by fitting the relativistically-broadened X-ray line profile of fluorescent iron emission from reflection off an accretion disk. In our hydrodynamic models, the contrast in density and thickness is low when H/R>0.1, sugesting that the iron line technique may be most reliable in extemely thin disks.

The intermediate eigenvalues that occur between the largest and the bulk have been associated in NYSE with specific business sectors with strong intra-group interactions.

However, since the neutrinos interact weakly with matter, their dynamics are affected by a range of micro-physical dissipation processes.  Our work aims at characterizing the dynamics of the neutrino disc in the presence of these micro-physical instabilities using high-fidelity numerical simulations. Specifically, we investigate the effects of the neutrino cooling, the generation of turbulence due to the convective instability, and the impact of neutrino oscillations on the evolution of the disc. Our analysis demonstrates that these instabilities can significantly affect the energy transport properties of the neutrino disc and have important implications for understanding the emission mechanism of GRBs.

This frequency band offers unprecedented sensitivity (~25 mJy/beam) and resolution (~25 arcsec) for low-frequency observations. We review the hardware, the calibration and imaging strategies, comparing them to those at higher frequencies, including aspects of interference excision and wide-field imaging. Ionospheric phase fluctuations pose the major difficulty in calibrating the array. Over restricted fields of view or at times of extremely quiescent ionospheric ``weather'', an angle-invariant calibration strategy can be used. In this approach a single phase correction is devised for each antenna, typically via self-calibration. Over larger fields of view or at times of more normal ionospheric ``weather'' when the ionospheric isoplanatic patch size is smaller than the field of view, we adopt a field-based strategy in which the phase correction depends upon location within the field of view. This second calibration strategy was implemented by modeling the ionosphere above the array using Zernike polynomials. Images of 3C sources of moderate strength are provided as examples of routine, angle-invariant calibration and imaging.

The intuition behind this is that when a susceptible person has multiple potential infectors, there is a ``race'' to infect him or her in which only the first infectious contact leads to infection. In an epidemic, the mean generation interval contracts as the prevalence of infection increases. We call this global competition among potential infectors. When there is rapid transmission within clusters of contacts, generation interval contraction can be caused by a high local prevalence of infection even when the global prevalence is low. We call this local competition among potential infectors. Using simulations, we illustrate both types of competition.   Finally, we show that hazards of infectious contact can be used instead of generation intervals to estimate the time course of the effective reproductive number in an epidemic.

Here we address the nature of these height fluctuations by means of straightforward atomistic Monte Carlo simulations based on a very accurate many-body interatomic potential for carbon. We find that ripples spontaneously appear due to thermal fluctuations with a size distribution peaked around 70 \\AA which is compatible with experimental findings (50-100 \\AA) but not with the current understanding of stability of flexible membranes.

Although a systematic time-resolved monitoring campaign is required to distinguish between the two scenarios, we currently favour the latter, given the short timescale of the observed polarization variability.

By considering the monotonicity of the underlying function, we can obtain a simpler and more interpretable model while enabling better performance on large-scale data sets. Our methodology involves an iterative process that selects variables at each step. We then consider the monotonicity constraints of each variable and compute the corresponding regression coefficients in an efficient manner.

Two kinds of acceleration regions (annular and core) need to be taken into account. The annular acceleration region is defined by the magnetic field lines that cross the null charge surface within the light cylinder. (2). If the potential drop in the annular region of a pulsar is high enough (normally the cases of young pulsars), charges in both the annular and the core regions could be accelerated and produce primary gamma-rays. Secondary pairs are generated in both regions and stream outwards to power the broadband radiations. (3). The potential drop in the annular region grows more rapidly than that in the core region. The annular acceleration process is a key point to produce wide emission beams as observed. (4). The advantages of both the polar cap and outer gap models are retained in this model. The geometric properties of the $\\gamma$-ray emission from the annular flow is analogous to that presented in a previous work by Qiao et al., which match the observations well. (5).

We find that the SE and SED relations break down in both subsets, and that the breakdowns occur on all scales of mobility. Thus these breakdowns appear to be generalized phenomena, in contrast with the view where only the most mobile molecules are the origin of the breakdown of the SE and SED relations, embedded in an inactive background where these relations hold. At low temperature, the SE and SED relations in both subsets of molecules are replaced with ``fractional'' SE and SED relations, $D_t\\sim(\\tau/T)^{-\\xi_t}$ and $D_r\\sim(\\tau/T)^{-\\xi_r}$ where $\\xi_t\\approx0.84<1$ and $\\xi_r\\approx0.75<1$.

We also find that when the decoupling increases, upon cooling, the probability of a molecule being classified as both translationally and rotationally fastest also increases. To study the effect of time scale for SE and SED breakdown and decoupling, we introduce a time-dependent version of the SE and SED relations, and a time-dependent function that measures the extent of decoupling.

The SED relations connect the diffusion coefficient of a particle to its friction and the temperature of the solvent, and have been widely used to describe the transport properties of simple liquids such as water. However, recent experiments and simulations have shown that the SED relations break down in complex liquids such as supercooled water, and their underlying assumptions do not hold.  Our results show that the breakdown of the SED relations in water can be attributed to the dynamical heterogeneities of the liquid, where some regions of the liquid are more mobile than others. We find that the diffusion of water molecules in these heterogeneous regions is faster than in the bulk, leading to a non-linear relationship between the diffusion coefficient, viscosity, and temperature. Moreover, we observe a decoupling between the rotational and translational motion of water molecules, suggesting that the rotational and translation relaxation times depend on different factors.  Our study is motivated by the need for a better understanding of the transport properties of complex liquids such as water, and our work sheds light on the role of dynamical heterogeneities in breaking the SED relations.

By calculating the variance from the life history parameters, it is shown that selection against variance in the growth rate will favor a genotypes with lower stochasticity in age specific survival and fertility rates. A diffusion approximation for selection and drift in a population with two genotypes with different life history matrices (and therefore, different growth rates and demographic variances) is derived and shown to be consistent with individual based simulations.

To explore this question, we develop a mathematical model that accounts for the effects of both selection and demographic stochasticity on population dynamics. We show that selection can act to stabilize population growth even in the presence of demographic stochasticity, through its effects on the evolution of life history traits such as lifespan, fecundity, and age at maturity. Specifically, we find that populations subject to strong selection for high fecundity or early reproduction are more vulnerable to demographic stochasticity, whereas those subject to strong selection for longevity or late reproduction are more resistant to it.

A natural transformation i:T \\hat{\\otimes}_R (-) \\to (-) \\hat{\\otimes}_R T is given by the flip map and a morphism w: X \\otimes_R T \\to T\\otimes_R X is constructed whenever T is a (co)module algebra or coring of an R-bialgebroid. Stable anti Yetter-Drinfel'd modules over certain bialgebroids, so called x_R-Hopf algebras, are introduced. In the particular example when T is a module coring of a x_R-Hopf algebra B and X is a stable anti Yetter-Drinfel'd B-module, the para-cyclic object Z_* is shown to project to a cyclic structure on T^{\\otimes_R *+1} \\otimes_B X. For a B-Galois extension S \\to T, a stable anti Yetter-Drinfel'd B-module T_S is constructed, such that the cyclic objects B^{\\otimes_R *+1} \\otimes_B T_S and T^ {\\hat{\\otimes}_S *+1} are isomorphic.

We compute Fourier phase-difference spectra that are spatially averaged separately over mossy and non-mossy plage to study temporal modulations as a function of temporal frequency. The 1550 versus 171 A comparison shows zero phase difference in non-mossy plage. In mossy plage, the phase differences between all UV and EUV passbands show pronounced upward trends with increasing frequency, which abruptly changes into zero phase difference beyond 4-6 mHz. The phase difference between the 171 and 195 A sequences exhibits a shallow dip below 3 mHz and then also turns to zero phase difference beyond this value. We attribute the various similarities between the UV and EUV diagnostics that are evident in the phase-difference diagrams to the contribution of the C IV resonance lines in the 1550 and 1600 A passbands. The strong upward trend at the lower frequencies indicates the presence of upward-traveling disturbances. It points to correspondence between the lower chromosphere and the upper transition region, perhaps by slow-mode magnetosonic disturbances, or by a connection between chromospheric and coronal heating mechanisms. The transition from this upward trend to zero phase difference at higher frequencies is due to the intermittent obscuration by fibrils that occult the foot points of hot loops, which are bright in the EUV and C IV lines, in oscillatory manner.

Moreover, the detection of these shapes can provide information about the quasar's spin axis, inclination, and surrounding baryonic structures.   The problem that this work attempts to solve is the lack of observational evidence for the anisotropic shapes of quasar HII regions during reionization. By exploring a novel detection method, we contribute to the growing body of research that aims to gain a better understanding of the early universe's structures and evolution.

On high traffic links it is sometimes impossible to record every packet. Researchers have approached the problem of estimating flow lengths from sampled packet data in two separate ways. Firstly, different sampling methodologies can be tried to more accurately measure the desired system parameters. One such method is the sample-and-hold method where, if a packet is sampled, all subsequent packets in that flow are sampled. Secondly, statistical methods can be used to ``invert'' the sampled data and produce an estimate of flow lengths from a sample.   In this paper we propose, implement and test two variants on the sample-and-hold method. In addition we show how the sample-and-hold method can be inverted to get an estimation of the genuine distribution of flow sizes. Experiments are carried out on real network traces to compare standard packet sampling with three variants of sample-and-hold. The methods are compared for their ability to reconstruct the genuine distribution of flow sizes in the traffic.

Therefore, we propose a novel approach that combines the strengths of statistical methods with physically meaningful information to improve the accuracy of flow inversion estimates.  Our methodology involves formulating the flow inversion problem as a statistical inference task, where the unknown flow parameters are inferred from a set of observations and physical laws of fluid flow. Specifically, we employ Bayesian inference techniques to compute posterior distributions over the flow parameters, which facilitate the incorporation of prior knowledge and measurement uncertainty. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by performing simulations on several benchmark problems, as well as comparing our results to those obtained by existing methods.

Because of incomplete angular momentum cancellation a warped accretion disc forms in the inner few parsec. The orientation of the disc performs a random walk. Deposition of new material promotes SMBH accretion at rates much faster than viscous. Observational implications of this picture include: (i) lighter accretion discs that can fuel AGN and quasars and yet avoid star formation at R >> 0.1 pc; (ii) star formation inside the disc is not a function of mass accretion rate only. It can take place at high or low accretion rates, e.g., when too few clouds arrive in the inner region. An example of this might be the central parsec of our Galaxy. (iii) The discs can form Compton-thick obscuring structures of ~ parsec size as required in AGN unification models; (iv) faster black hole growth resulting from misalignment of the disc and the black hole spin in the early Universe; (v) Isotropic deposition of SMBH energy and momentum feedback in the galaxy bulge.

Observational data spanning Type Ia Supernovae, the cosmic microwave background (CMB), galaxy clustering, and weak gravitational lensing statistics are fit without requiring the two meta-parameters to be equal.

We find that 2% of unresolved optical sources brighter than g=20.5 appear variable at the 0.05 mag level (rms) simultaneously in the g and r bands. The majority (2/3) of these variable sources are low-redshift (<2) quasars, although they represent only 2% of all sources in the adopted flux-limited sample. We find that at least 90% of quasars are variable at the 0.03 mag level (rms) and confirm that variability is as good a method for finding low-redshift quasars as is the UV excess color selection (at high Galactic latitudes). We analyze the distribution of lightcurve skewness for quasars and find that is centered on zero.

The reference PES to which the rest are compared is the MP2/6-311++G(2df,2pd) homolevel, which, as far as we are aware, is the more accurate PES of a dipeptide in the literature. The aim of the study presented is twofold: On the one hand, the evaluation of the influence of polarization and diffuse functions in the basis set, distinguishing between those placed at 1st-row atoms and those placed at hydrogens, as well as the effect of different contraction and valence splitting schemes. On the other hand, the investigation of the heterolevel assumption, which is defined here to be that which states that heterolevel MCs are more efficient than homolevel MCs. The heterolevel approximation is very commonly used in the literature, but it is seldom checked. As far as we know, the only tests for peptides or related systems, have been performed using a small number of conformers, and this is the first time that this potentially very economical approximation is tested in full PESs. In order to achieve these goals, all data sets have been compared and analyzed in a way which captures the nearness concept in the space of MCs.

This result also holds in every Artin-Tits group of spherical type.   On the other hand, the conjugacy search problem in braid groups is usually solved by computing some finite sets called (left) ultra summit sets (left-USS), using left normal forms of braids. But one can equally use right normal forms and compute right-USS's. Hard instances of the conjugacy search problem correspond to elements having big (left and right) USS's. One may think that even if some element has a big left-USS, it could possibly have a small right-USS. We show that this is not the case in the important particular case of rigid braids. More precisely, we show that the left-USS and the right-USS of a given rigid braid determine isomorphic graphs, with the arrows reversed, the isomorphism being defined using iterated cycling.

The methodology includes event selection based on the collision topology and detector signature, background estimation from data-driven methods and Monte Carlo simulations, as well as fitting procedures to extract the production cross section and the anomalous coupling limits.  In conclusion, the results of this study provide valuable information on the electroweak sector of the standard model and add constraints on the possible new physics scenarios that involve anomalous couplings of the Z boson to photons. Further studies with higher statistics and improved detector capabilities will be essential in searching for new physics beyond the standard model.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "arxiv", "source_ID": 705.155}

Its eruption resembled the well-known FU Orionis-type or EX Lupi-type outbursts. Since very few such events have ever been documented at infrared wavelengths, our aim is to study the temporal evolution of OO Ser in the infrared. OO Ser was monitored with the Infrared Space Observatory starting 4 months after peak brightness and covering 20 months. In 2004-2006 we again observed OO Ser from the ground and complemented this dataset with archival Spitzer obsevations also from 2004. We analysed these data with special attention to source confusion and constructed light curves at 10 different wavelengths as well as spectral energy distributions. The outburst caused brightening in the whole infrared regime. According to the infrared light curves, OO Ser started a wavelength-independent fading after peak brightness. Later the flux decay became slower but stayed wavelength-independent. The fading is still ongoing, and current fading rates indicate that OO Ser will not return to quiescent state before 2011. The outburst timescale of OO Ser seems to be shorter than that of FUors, but longer than that of EXors. The outburst timescale and the moderate luminosity suggest that OO Ser is different from both FUors and EXors, and shows similarities to the recently erupted young star V1647 Ori. Based on its spectral energy distribution and bolometric temperature, OO Ser seems to be an early class I object, with an age of < 10^5 yr. The object is probably surrounded by an accretion disc and a dense envelope. Due to the shorter outburst timescales, the viscosity in the circumstellar disc of OO Ser is probably an order of magnitude higher than usual for FUors.

Our research is motivated by the need to understand the mechanisms of variability in pre-main sequence stars, particularly those exhibiting eruptive phenomena.  We obtained the photometric data from various ground-based surveys and analyzed the light curves for periodicity using Fourier analysis and Lomb-Scargle periodograms. We also examined the spectral energy distribution and investigated the possible association with known young clusters.  Our results show that OO Serpentis underwent several outbursts, with the most significant occurring in 1996. The light curve is characterized by repeated flare-like events that exhibit aperiodic variability with a dominant period of ~6.3 days. The star's optical brightness shows a strong correlation with the near-infrared magnitude, indicating that the variability is most likely due to changes in the circumstellar disk.  Our study highlights the importance of long-term monitoring of young stars to fully understand their variability and provide insights into the physical processes governing star formation.

I investigate how the framework for consistent reasoning must be modified in non-classical situations where hypotheses form a continuum, yet the maximum evidence accessible through experiment is not allowed to exceed some finite upper bound. Invoking basic consistency requirements pertaining to the preparation and composition of systems, as well as to the continuity of probabilities, I show that the modified theory must have an internal symmetry isomorphic to the unitary group.

Our motivation for this research is rooted in the realization that traditional statistical methods often rely on the assumption that there is a finite set of possible hypotheses. However, in many real-world scenarios, the true hypothesis may lie in a continuum of possibilities. To address this challenge, we propose a framework that allows for consistent reasoning about a continuum of hypotheses using a Bayesian approach. Our methodology is based on the use of a Bayesian functional prior, which characterizes the prior distribution over the space of hypotheses as a function. By applying this framework, we are able to make principled inferences about the true hypothesis using a finite amount of evidence.  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on both synthetic and real-world data, highlighting the improved accuracy and robustness of our method compared to traditional approaches.

The IRAC point, along with previously published secondary eclipse photometry for HD 189733b, are in good agreement with a one-dimensional model of HD 189733b that clearly shows absorption due to water vapor in the emergent spectrum. We are not able to draw firm conclusions regarding the IRS data for HD 209458b, but spectra predicted by 1D and 3D atmosphere models fit the data adequately, without adjustment of the water abundance or reliance on cloud opacity.

Our data were taken mostly with the near infrared adaptive optics integral field spectrograph SINFONI. The stellar light profiles typically have size scales of a few tens of parsecs. In two cases there is unambiguous kinematic evidence for stellar disks on these scales. In the nuclear regions there appear to have been recent - but no longer active - starbursts in the last 10-300Myr. The stellar luminosity is less than a few percent of the AGN in the central 10pc, whereas on kiloparsec scales the luminosities are comparable. The surface stellar luminosity density follows a similar trend in all the objects, increasing steadily at smaller radii up to 10^{13}L_sun/kpc^2 in the central few parsecs, where the mass surface density exceeds 10^4M_sun/pc^2. The intense starbursts were probably Eddington limited and hence inevitably short-lived, implying that the starbursts occur in multiple short bursts. The data hint at a delay of 50--100Myr between the onset of star formation and subsequent fuelling of the black hole. We discuss whether this may be a consequence of the role that stellar ejecta could play in fuelling the black hole. While a significant mass is ejected by OB winds and supernovae, their high velocity means that very little of it can be accreted. On the other hand winds from AGB stars ultimately dominate the total mass loss, and they can also be accreted very efficiently because of their slow speeds.

Our results show that star formation in AGN host galaxies is mainly influenced by the AGN power and the gas mass. There is clear evidence of suppressed star formation in AGN-dominated systems compared to AGN-absent galaxies at the same gas masses, indicating that AGN feedback plays a significant role in regulating star-forming activities.

We explain the maximum in DAMA signals observed in the May-June period to be associated with the formation behind the Sun of a trail of daemons that the Sun captures into elongated orbits as it moves to the apex. The range of significant 2-6-keV DAMA signals fits well the iodine nuclei elastically knocked out of the NaI(Tl) scintillator by particles falling on the Earth with V=30-50 km/s from strongly elongated heliocentric orbits. The half-year periodicity of the slower daemons observed in SPb originates from the transfer of particles that are deflected through ~90 deg into near-Earth orbits each time the particles cross the outer reaches of the Sun which had captured them. Their multi-loop (cross-like) trajectories traverse many times the Earth's orbit in March and September, which increases the probability for the particles to enter near-Earth orbits during this time.

In the limit of a continuum of infinite layers, the optimal power distribution that minimizes the expected distortion is given by the solution to a set of linear differential equations in terms of the density of the fading distribution. In the optimal power distribution, as SNR increases, the allocation over the higher layers remains unchanged; rather the extra power is allocated towards the lower layers. On the other hand, as the bandwidth ratio b (channel uses per source symbol) tends to zero, the power distribution that minimizes expected distortion converges to the power distribution that maximizes expected capacity. While expected distortion can be improved by acquiring CSI at the transmitter (CSIT) or by increasing diversity from the realization of independent fading paths, at high SNR the performance benefit from diversity exceeds that from CSIT, especially when b is large.

We prove that our approach achieves the global MED optimal solution in polynomial complexity.   Through numerical simulations, we show that our proposed MED optimization framework outperforms the conventional SR scheme in terms of expected distortion, especially at high channel quality gaps and for delay-sensitive applications.

In BICMB, this property does not hold. On the other hand, the optimum precoder and detector for BICMB are invariant under a diagonal unitary transform. In order to design a limited-rate CSIT system for BICMB, we propose a new distortion measure optimum under this invariance. Based on this new distortion measure, we introduce a new set of centroids and employ the generalized Lloyd algorithm for codebook design.

The black hole itself remains on an orbit of fixed amplitude and merely acts as a catalyst for the evolution of the stellar energy distribution function f(E). We show that this effect is operative out to a radius of approx 3 to 4 times the hole's influence radius, R_bh.

Here, we employ the recently developed genetic embedded matching (GEM) heuristic to investigate the nature of the zero-temperature phase of the bimodal XY spin glass in two dimensions.

The ratio of magnetic to rotational kinetic energy in these configurations is chosen to be small (1% and 10%). We find that such magnetic fields do not affect the initial collapse significantly. The core collapses to a black hole, after which black hole excision is employed to continue the evolution long enough for the hole to reach a quasi-stationary state.

We freeze the spacetime metric (\"Cowling approximation\") and continue to follow the evolution of the torus after the black hole has relaxed to quasi-stationary equilibrium. In the absence of magnetic fields, the torus settles down following ejection of a small amount of matter due to shock heating. When magnetic fields are present, the field lines gradually collimate along the hole's rotation axis. MHD shocks and the MRI generate MHD turbulence in the torus and stochastic accretion onto the central black hole. When the magnetic field is strong, a wind is generated in the torus, and the torus undergoes radial oscillations that drive episodic accretion onto the hole. These oscillations produce long-wavelength gravitational waves potentially detectable by LISA.

Using Far-Infrared emission data, we show that the large scatter seen in previous studies of lambda_max as a function of A_V is primarily due to line of sight effects causing some A_V measurements to not be a good tracer of the extinction (radiation field strength) seen by the grains being probed. The derived slopes in lambda_max vs. A_V, for the individual clouds, are consistent with a common value, while the zero intercepts scale with the average values of the ratios of total-to-selective extinction (R_V) for the individual clouds. Within each cloud we do not find direct correlations between lambda_max and R_V. The positive slope in consistent with recent developments in theory and indicating alignment driven by the radiation field. The present data cannot conclusively differentiate between direct radiative torques and alignment driven by H_2 formation. However, the small values of lambda_max(A_V=0), seen in several clouds, suggest a role for the latter, at least at the cloud surfaces.

We also test for spectral index hardening associated with blazar variability for which we find no evidence. Finally, we produce simulated GLAST spectral index datasets and perform the same analyses. With improved statistics due to the much larger number of resolvable blazars, GLAST data will help us determine the ISIDs with much improved accuracy.

We first demonstrate the reality of the interface sequence, the unifying feature of the rotational observations of cluster and field stars that makes the technique possible, and extends it beyond the proposal of Skumanich by specifying the mass dependence of rotation for these stars. We delineate which stars it cannot currently be used on. We then calibrate the age dependence using the Sun. The errors are propagated to understand their dependence on color and period. Representative age errors associated with the technique are estimated at ~15% (plus possible systematic errors) for late-F, G, K, & early-M stars. Ages derived via gyrochronology for the Mt.

Combining a theoretical model of mass accretion onto black holes with a multiphase description of star-forming gas, we self-consistently follow evolution of both galaxies and their central black holes. The novelty in our model is that we consider two distinct accretion modes: standard radiatively efficient thin accretion disks and radiatively inefficient accretion flows which we will generically refer to as RIAFs; motivated by theoretical models for jet production in accretion disks, we assume that only the RIAF is responsible for the AGN feedback. We find that, after an initial episode of bursting star formation, the accretion rate onto the central black hole drops so that the accretion disk switches to a RIAF structure. At this point, the feedback from the AGN becomes efficient and slightly suppresses star formation in the galactic disk and almost completely halts star formation in the bulge. As a result, the nucleus becomes a stochastically fuelled low-luminosity AGN (Seyfert galaxy) with recurrent short-lived episodes of activity after the star bursts. Our model predicts several properties of the low-luminosity AGN including the bolometric luminosity, jet powers, the effect on kpc-scale of the radio jet and the AGN lifetime, which are in broad agreement with observations of Seyfert galaxies and their radio activity.

This suggests that preheated efficiently smoothes the accreted gas, and therefore a shift in the unmodified profile is a good approximation even with a realistic accretion history.

The stellar kinematics of all galaxies in the sample show regular rotation patterns typical of disc-like systems, with kinematic axes which are well aligned with those derived from the outer photometry and which provide a reliable representation of the galactic line of nodes. After removal of the non-gravitational components due to e.g. AGN-driven outflows, the ionised gas kinematics in both the Seyfert and inactive galaxies are also dominated by rotation with global alignment between stars and gas in most galaxies. This result is consistent with previous findings from photometric studies that the large-scale light distribution of Seyfert hosts are similar to inactive hosts.

Specifically, we aim to identify sources with a steep spectrum that may result from synchrotron radiation as their radiating particles lose energy, as well as sources with a compact morphology indicative of the cessation of their jets.   The problem we aim to solve is the challenge of identifying dying radio sources in a large sample of radio galaxies. To achieve this, we use a combination of spectral and morphological criteria, as well as visual inspection of the radio images. Our key idea is that dying radio sources can be identified by their spectral index and morphology, which can provide evidence of their aged and weakened state.  Our methodology involves selecting a sample of radio sources from the FIRST and NVSS surveys, applying selection criteria to identify potential dying sources, and analyzing their radio spectra and morphologies using radio imaging tools.

For the no accretion case, we consider the Einstein-Straus solution, where a black hole of constant mass resides in the dust Friedmann universe.

This is given in terms of the cubic root of ratio in size of the black hole to the cosmological horizon, so that it is currently of order $10^{-5} (M/10^{6}M_{\\odot})^{1/3} (t/14 {Gyr})^{-1/3}$ but could have been significant at the formation epoch of primordial black holes.

For the significant accretion case, we consider the Sultana-Dyer solution, where a black hole tends to increase its mass in proportion to the cosmological scale factor. In this model, we find that the radiation power is apparently the same as the Hawking radiation from the Schwarzschild black hole of which mass is that of the growing mass at each moment.

In the absence of significant external perturbations, the key factor determining a cluster's long-term survival chances is the shape of its stellar initial mass function (IMF).

Our results also reveal some correlations between the spectral parameters, like the peak energy and the fluence or luminosity, which suggest an intrinsic link between the spectral properties and the physics of GRBs.

The simulations were performed within the flat-Lambda, open and flat matter only CDM cosmogonies. Two unconstrained simulations of the flat-Lambda and open CDM models were performed for comparison. LG-like objects have been selected so as to mimic the real LG environment. The local gravitational field due to all halos found within each LV is compared with the exact gravitational field induced by all matter in the simulation. We conclude that there is no correlation between the exact and the local gravitational field obtained by pairwise newtonian forces between halos. Moreover, the local gravitational field is uncorrelated with the peculiar velocities of halos. The exact gravitational field has a linear correlation with peculiar velocities but the proportionality constant relating the velocity with gravitational field falls below the prediction of the linear theory. Upon considering all matter inside the LVs, the exact and local gravitational accelerations show a much better correlation, but with a considerable scatter independent on the cosmological models.

In star-forming environments, enhanced cooling can potentially lead to fragmentation and the formation of low-mass stars, where metal-free gas-clouds have been shown not to fragment. Adding metal cooling to numerical simulations has traditionally required a choice between speed and accuracy. We introduce a method that uses the sophisticated chemical network of the photoionization software, Cloudy, to include radiative cooling from a complete set of metals up to atomic number 30 (Zn) that can be used with large-scale three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. Our method is valid over an extremely large temperature range (10 K < T < 10^8 K), up to hydrogen number densities of 10^12 cm^-3. At this density, a sphere of 1 Msun has a radius of roughly 40 AU. We implement our method in the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) hydrodynamic/N-body code, Enzo. Using cooling rates generated with this method, we study the physical conditions that led to the transition from Population III to Population II star formation. While C, O, Fe, and Si have been previously shown to make the strongest contribution to the cooling in low-metallicity gas, we find that up to 40% of the metal cooling comes from fine-structure emission by S, when solar abundance patterns are present. At metallicities, Z > 10^-4 Zsun, regions of density and temperature exist where gas is both thermally unstable and has a cooling time less than its dynamical time.

As the cost and observing cadence for such a mission will be driven largely by the separation between the two spacecraft, it is critically important to design an occulter that can meet the observing goals while flying as close to the telescope as possible. In this paper, we explore this tradeoff between separation and occulter diameter. More specifically, we present a method for designing the shape of the outer edge of an occulter that is as small as possible and gives a shadow that is deep enough and large enough for a 4m telescope to survey the habitable zones of many stars for Earth-like planets. In particular, we show that in order for a 4m telescope to detect in broadband visible light a planet 0.06 arcseconds from a star shining $10^{10}$ times brighter than the planet requires a specially-shaped occulter 50m in diameter positioned about $72,000$ km in front of the telescope.

Our key idea is to use numerical optimization techniques to determine the optimal shape and size of the occulter for the given telescope and target star parameters.

Under proper microwave irradiation conditions, the CBA has two metastable states. Which state is adopted by the CBA depends on the state of a quantronium qubit coupled to the CBA's junction. Due to the MHz repetition rate and large signal to noise ratio we can show directly that the coherence is limited by 1/f gate charge noise when biased at the sweet spot - a point insensitive to first order gate charge fluctuations.

By analyzing the time evolution of the population of the qubit, we were able to determine the decoherence time.  Our results indicate that the decoherence time varies with the detuning between the qubit and the cavity.

We show how the sine-Liouville interaction term arises through a twisting of the marginal deformation introduced here, and discuss such 'twisting' as a non-trivial realization of the symmetries of the theory. After briefly reviewing the computation of correlation functions in sine-Liouville CFT, we give a precise prescription for computing correlation functions in the twisted model. To show the new version of the correspondence we make use of a formula recently proven by S. Ribault and J.

Photons are produced in large quantities during QGP formation, and the virtual photons are believed to carry information on the initial state of QGP and its subsequent evolution. Thus, the study of virtual photon emission from QGP is of great interest to both experimental and theoretical physicists.  We employed a perturbative approach based on quantum electrodynamics (QED) to calculate the virtual photon production rate. The key idea is to consider the QGP as a source of charged particles that interact with the electromagnetic field. Our methodology involves identifying the dominant contributing processes, computing the corresponding Feynman diagrams, and extracting the production rate. Our results indicate that the virtual photon production rate increases rapidly with temperature and is sensitive to the QGP initial conditions.  The motivation for this work is to deepen our understanding of QGP, which is critical for the interpretation of experiments at high-energy colliders, such as the Large Hadron Collider. Our work attempts to solve the problem of quantifying the virtual photon emission from QGP and its dependence on temperature and initial conditions. The insights gained from this work can aid in the determination of QGP properties and the search for evidence of QGP in future experiments.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "arxiv", "source_ID": 704.3676}

Assuming that the jet of particles and the plasma can be described using a hydrodynamical approach, we derive and discuss the dispersion laws for the unstable collective modes. In our analysis the chromohydrodynamical equations for the collective modes are tackled in the linear response approximation. Such an approximation, valid for short time scales, allows to study in a straightforward way the dependence of the dispersion laws of the collective modes on the velocity of the jet, on the magnitude of the momentum of the collective mode and on the angle between these two quantities. We find that unstable modes arise for velocity of the jet larger than the speed of the sound of the plasma and only modes with momenta smaller than a certain values are unstable. Moreover, for ultrarelativistic velocities of the jet the longitudinal mode becomes stable and the most unstable modes correspond to relative angles between the velocity of the jet and momentum of the collective mode larger than $\\sim \\pi/8$.

Our study focuses on the key idea that the relativistic jets emanating from active galactic nuclei (AGN) can trigger a cascade of MHD instabilities. Through a combination of numerical simulations and analytical calculations, we demonstrate how the propagation of these jets through the ambient medium can create Rayleigh-Taylor, Kelvin-Helmholtz, and current-driven MHD instabilities, which can lead to the formation of structures like filaments, turbulence, and shocks.  Our methodology involves solving the MHD equations, coupled with the equations of state and radiation transfer, using high-performance computing facilities. We use a range of numerical techniques, including adaptive mesh refinement and particle-in-cell simulations, to capture the complex physical processes involved in the generation and evolution of these instabilities.  The motivation for our research lies in the importance of the AGN and jet feedback in shaping the evolution of galaxies and clusters of galaxies.

This kind of phase transition, if verified experimentally, will lead to the first proof that non-Hermitian and $PT$ symmetric models are not just a mathematical research framework but are a nature desire. To do the investigation, we calculated the effective potential up to second order in the couplings and found a Hermitian to Non-Hermitian phase transition. This leads us to introduce, for the first time, hermiticity as a symmetry which can be broken due to quantum corrections, \\textit{i.e.}, when starting with a model which is Hermitian in the classical level, quantum corrections can break hermiticity while the theory stays physically acceptable. In fact, ignoring this phase will lead to violation of universality when comparing this model predictions with other models in the same class of universality. For instance, in a previous work we obtained a second order phase transition for the $PT$ symmetric and non-Hermitian $(-g\\phi^{4})$ and according to universality, this phase should exist in the phase structure of the ($g\\phi^{4}+h\\phi^{6}$) model for negative $g$.

This allows a detailed study of the relative distributions of small and large dust grains.   Images of IRS 48 in 5 mid-infrared bands from 8.6 to 18.7 micron as well as a low resolution N-band spectrum are obtained with VLT-VISIR. Optical spectroscopy is used to determine the spectral type of the central star and to measure the strength of the Halpha line.   The 18.7 micron ring peaks at a diameter of 110 AU, with a gap of ~ 60 AU. The shape of the ring is consistent with an inclination of i = 48 +- 8 degrees. In contrast, the 7.5-13 micron PAH emission bands are centered on the source and appear to fill the gap within the ring. The measured PAH line strengths are 10-100x stronger than those typically measured for young M0 stars and can only be explained with a high PAH abundance and/or strong excess optical/UV emission. The morphology of the images, combined with the absence of a silicate emission feature, imply that the inner disk has been cleared of micron-sized dust but with a significant population of PAHs remaining.

METHODS: We use the X-ray spectral analysis to assess the presence of an AGN in these sources and to characterize its properties. RESULTS: We detect AGN activity in 33 out of 35 sources. The remaining 2 sources are the ones with the lowest X-ray luminosity in the sample (L[2-10keV]<10^41 erg s^-1) and their X-ray emission could be produced within the host galaxy.

We find that while most of the galaxies in our sample are star-forming galaxies, there is also a significant population of quiescent galaxies. Our results suggest that the selection of galaxies based on their colours can provide distinctive information about their physical properties.  We use a combination of photometric data from the UltraVISTA and Ultra-Deep Spectroscopy (UDS) surveys to create colour-colour diagrams for our sample of distant galaxies. We then examine the positions of the galaxies in these diagrams relative to the colour tracks of different galaxy types. The key idea behind our methodology is that the observed colours of galaxies are closely related to their physical properties, such as their star formation rates, ages and metallicities. By using colour selection to identify different galaxy types, we can gain insight into the physical conditions and processes that govern galaxy evolution in the early universe.

If these nuclear operators are approximated by their one-body forms and expanded in the nucleon velocity through order |\\vec{p}|/M, where \\vec{p} and M are the nucleon momentum and mass, a set of seven multipole operators is obtained. Nuclear structure calculations are often performed in a basis of Slater determinants formed from harmonic oscillator orbitals, a choice that allows translational invariance to be preserved. Harmonic-oscillator single-particle matrix elements of the multipole operators can be evaluated analytically and expressed in terms of finite polynomials in q^2, where q is the magnitude of the three-momentum transfer. While results for such matrix elements are available in tabular form, with certain restriction on quantum numbers, the task of determining the analytic form of a response function can still be quite tedious, requiring the folding of the tabulated matrix elements with the nuclear density matrix, and subsequent algebra to evaluate products of operators. Here we provide a Mathematica script for generating these matrix elements, which will allow users to carry out all such calculations by symbolic manipulation. This will eliminate the errors that may accompany hand calculations and speed the calculation of electroweak nuclear cross sections and rates. We illustrate the use of the new script by calculating the cross sections for charged- and neutral-current neutrino scattering in ^{12}C.

With this interpretation, we are able to construct a spatially resolved extinction map across the cluster which is used to derive the intrinsic flux distribution.

Overall subhalos are more spherical than the host halo, with minor to major and intermediate to major axis ratios of 0.68 and 0.83, respectively. Like isolated halos, subhalos tend to be less spherical in their central regions. The principal axis ratios are independent of subhalo mass, when the shapes are measured within a physical scale like r_Vmax, the radius of the peak of the circular velocity curve. Subhalos tend to be slightly more spherical closer to the host halo center. The spatial distribution of the subhalos traces the prolate shape of the host halo when they are selected by the largest V_max they ever had, i.e. before they experienced strong tidal mass loss. The subhalos' orientation is not random: the major axis tends to align with the direction towards the host halo center. This alignment disappears for halos beyond 3 r_200 and is more pronounced when the shapes are measured in the outer regions of the subhalos. The radial alignment is preserved during a subhalo's orbit and they become elongated during pericenter passage, indicating that the alignment is likely caused by the host halo's tidal forces.

Up to six clones with a growth rate above or below the mean growth rate of the parent population were further cloned and the growth rates of their offsprings were measured. The distribution of the growth rates of the subclones did not significantly differ from that of the parent population thus suggesting that growth variability has an epigenetic origin.

The first plane is defined by the directions toward which local CMB features are anomalously aligned. A mean preferred axis is also identified in this plane, located very close to the ecliptic poles axis. The second plane is defined by the directions anomalously avoided by local CMB features. This alignment anomaly provides further insight on recent results (Wiaux et al. 2006). Secondly, a signed-intensity analysis identifies three mean preferred directions in the southern galactic hemisphere with anomalously high or low temperature of local CMB features: a cold spot essentially identified with a known cold spot (Vielva et al. 2004), a second cold spot lying very close to the southern end of the CMB dipole axis, and a hot spot lying close to the southern end of the ecliptic poles axis. In both analyses, the anomalies are observed at wavelet scales corresponding to angular sizes around 10 degress on the celestial sphere, with global significance levels around 1%. Further investigation reveals that the alignment and signed-intensity anomalies are only very partially related.

BV wide-field CCD photometry was obtained for open clusters for which photometric, structural, and dynamical evolution parameters were determined. The limiting and core radii were determined by analyzing radial density profiles. The ages, reddenings, and distances were obtained from the solar metallicity isochrone fitting.

The angular sizes for the majority of the observed clusters appear to be several times larger than the catalogue data indicate. The core and limiting cluster radii are correlated and the latter parameter is 3.2 times larger on average. The limiting radius increases with the cluster's mass, and both the limiting and core radii decrease in the course of dynamical evolution. For dynamically not advanced clusters, the mass function slope is similar to the universal IMF slope. For more evolved systems, the effect of evaporation of low-mass members is clearly visible.

The competition of the different interactions is responsible for which broken-symmetry ground state is eventually realized in a specific compound and which drives the system towards an insulating state.   Here we review the various ordering phenomena and how they can be identified by optic and magnetic measurements. While the final results might look very similar in the case of a charge density wave and a charge-ordered metal, for instance, the physical cause is completely different. When density waves form, a gap opens in the density of states at the Fermi energy due to nesting of the one-dimension Fermi surface sheets. When a one-dimensional metal becomes a charge-ordered Mott insulator, on the other hand, the short-range Coulomb repulsion localizes the charge on the lattice sites and even causes certain charge patterns.

We work out the graviton and Goldstone boson propagators explicitly by means of gauge fixing terms similar to the renormalizability gauges used in gauge theories. With these propagators, we calculate the lowest order tree-level interaction between two external energy momentum tensors. The result is independent of the gauge parameter, but different from the prediction of massless gravity theory, i.e., general relativity. This difference remains even if the mass of the graviton goes to zero, in which case it gives the van Dam-Veltman-Zakharov (vDVZ) discontinuity between the propagators of a massive and massless linearized graviton. Moreover, we show that the Fierz-Pauli graviton mass term can be considered as the ``unitary gauge'' of a more general theory with an extra scalar field. We explicitly construct such a theory in which the vDVZ discontinuity arises with a graviton mass term that is different from the Fierz-Pauli mass term.

By assuming a constant tangential velocity, the general solution of the vacuum gravitational field equations on the brane can be obtained in an exact analytic form. This allows us to obtain the explicit form of the projections of the bulk Weyl tensor on the brane, and the equation of state of the dark pressure as a function of the dark radiation.

We find that XO-2b has a radius of 1.06 \u00b1 0.03 R_J and a mass of 0.597 \u00b1 0.025 M_J, resulting in a density of 0.76 \u00b1 0.05 g cm^-3. Its host star has a mass of 1.16 \u00b1 0.04 M_sun and a radius of 1.09 \u00b1 0.04 R_sun.  Our work adds to the growing body of evidence that metal-rich environments are favorable for the formation of hot Jupiters. Additionally, the presence of the binary companion at a large separation suggests that XO-2b may have migrated inward due to planet-planet scattering interactions or Kozai-Lidov oscillations.

The line is thought to be produced by iron fluorescence of a relatively cold X-ray illuminated material in the innermost parts of the accretion disc and provides an excellent diagnostic of accretion flows in the vicinity of black holes. Previous studies have concentrated on the case of a thin, Keplerian accretion disc. This disc must become thicker and sub-Keplerian with increasing accretion rates. These can affect the line profiles and in turn can influence the estimation of the accretion disc and black hole parameters from the observed line profiles. We here embark on, for the first time, a fully relativistic computation which offers key insights into the effects of geometrical thickness and the sub-Keplerian orbital velocity on the line profiles. We include all relativistic effects such as frame-dragging, Doppler boost, time dilation, gravitational redshift and light bending. We find that the separation and the relative height between the blue and red peaks of the line profile diminish as the thickness of the disc increases. This code is also well-suited to produce accretion disc images. We calculate the redshift and flux images of the accretion disc and find that the observed image of the disc strongly depends on the inclination angle. The self-shadowing effect appears remarkable for a high inclination angle, and leads to the black hole shadow being completely hidden by the disc itself.

Our key idea is to use a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code to simulate the emission and absorption of X-rays in a geometrically thick accretion disc, where the radiation can be self-shadowed and distorted by the strong gravitational field of the black hole. By varying the disc parameters and the black hole spin, we generate synthetic iron K\u03b1 line profiles that can be compared to observations, thereby providing a tool to probe the accretion dynamics and black hole properties.   Our motivation for this research stems from the fact that the iron K\u03b1 line has been extensively observed in many sources, but its interpretation is fraught with uncertainty and model dependencies. Our work aims to provide a more realistic and predictive framework for modeling this line, thereby advancing our understanding of the accretion physics and black hole astrophysics in general.

Effects of nonlocal excitations are clarified by comparing the results with those of the single-site approximation.

The spectra at the Fermi level yield a hole-like Fermi surface in the underdoped region and an electron-like Fermi surface in the overdoped region. From a numerical analysis of the momentum dependent effective mass and self-energy, it is concluded that a marginal Fermi-liquid like state persists even at finite doping concentrations in the strongly correlated region because a van Hove singularity is pinned to the Fermi surface. It is also found that a kink structure appears in the quasiparticle energy band in the same region.

We compare three outflow models: No outflows, a \"constant wind\" (cw) model that emulates the popular Dekel & Silk (1986) scenario, and a ``momentum-driven wind\" (vzw) model. We find that only the vzw scaling reproduces the observed z~2 MZR's slope, amplitude, and scatter. Comparing our fully three-dimensional simulations with a simple one-zone chemical evolution model, we find that the MZR can be understood in terms of three parameters: (1) The equilibrium metallicity Z_eq=y*SFR/ACC (where y=true yield), reflecting the enrichment balance between star formation rate SFR and gas accretion rate ACC; (2) the dilution time t_d=M_g/ACC, representing the timescale for a galaxy to return to Z_eq after a metallicity-perturbing interaction; and (3) the blowout mass M_blowout, which is the galaxy stellar mass above which winds can escape its halo. When outflows with mass loading factor MLF are present, galaxies below M_blowout obey Z_eq = y/(1+MLF), while above M_blowout, Z_eq->y. Our cw model has M_blowout ~ 10^10 M_sun, which yields a sharp upturn in the MZR above this scale and a flat MZR with large scatter below it, in strong disagreement with observations.

Quite interestingly, this noisy feedback model is shown to be more advantageous in the current setting. More specifically, the discrete memoryless modulo-additive channel with a full-duplex destination node is considered first, and it is shown that the judicious use of feedback increases the perfect secrecy capacity to the capacity of the source-destination channel in the absence of the wiretapper. In the achievability scheme, the feedback signal corresponds to a private key, known only to the destination. In the half-duplex scheme, a novel feedback technique that always achieves a positive perfect secrecy rate (even when the source-wiretapper channel is less noisy than the source-destination channel) is proposed. These results hinge on the modulo-additive property of the channel, which is exploited by the destination to perform encryption over the channel without revealing its key to the source.

We propose an encryption scheme that utilizes feedback information from the receiver to enhance the secrecy of the transmitted message. Specifically, we use a technique that combines structured codes and tree codes to achieve the desired level of security.

One of the most important observables of these objects is their spin rate, which can change during accretion processes. The r-mode instability arises due to the curvature of spacetime and affects the dynamics of rotating stars through the emission of gravitational radiation.   Our approach involves a theoretical model that incorporates the nonlinear aspects of the r-mode instability, using numerical simulations to study the evolution of the system under different external conditions. We have focused on accreting neutron stars that are undergoing mass transfer from a companion star, which affects the r-mode instability and can lead to significant spin changes. Our results reveal a complex interplay between the accretion torque and the r-mode instability, which leads to intricate spin evolution scenarios.   Our work provides insights into the astrophysical implications of the r-mode instability in neutron star systems and highlights the need for further investigations on the topic. The methodology of our study can be extended to other types of accreting compact objects, such as black holes and white dwarfs.

The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is usually a main factor in determining the probability of error (or of communication failure) in a link. These probabilities are then a proxy for the SNR under which the links operate. The paper studies the problem of designing the topology, i.e., assigning the probabilities of reliable communication among sensors (or of link failures) to maximize the rate of convergence of average consensus, when the link communication costs are taken into account, and there is an overall communication budget constraint. To consider this problem, we address a number of preliminary issues: (1) model the network as a random topology; (2) establish necessary and sufficient conditions for mean square sense (mss) and almost sure (a.s.) convergence of average consensus when network links fail; and, in particular, (3) show that a necessary and sufficient condition for both mss and a.s. convergence is for the algebraic connectivity of the mean graph describing the network topology to be strictly positive. With these results, we formulate topology design, subject to random link failures and to a communication cost constraint, as a constrained convex optimization problem to which we apply semidefinite programming techniques. We show by an extensive numerical study that the optimal design improves significantly the convergence speed of the consensus algorithm and can achieve the asymptotic performance of a non-random network at a fraction of the communication cost.

Such topology design is fundamental for the effective functioning of distributed systems, as it greatly affects their performance and resilience. In particular, our research is motivated by the need to develop an optimal topology for distributed consensus, which is a crucial problem in networked control systems.  Our approach is based on the theory of random graphs and the notion of connectivity. First, we model the sensor network as a random graph, in which the edges between sensors are formed probabilistically according to a certain distribution. Using probabilistic tools and graph theory, we derived the probability of obtaining different connectivity levels for the network. Then, we propose an optimization problem that aims to maximize the connectivity of the network while minimizing its link costs. Finally, we present a numerical algorithm that solves the optimization problem efficiently.  Our work attempts to solve the problem of designing an optimal communication topology for sensor networks, which is a challenging task due to the high level of complexity and the need for distributed and decentralized solutions.

Evidence for this has been found for many families by studying the n-level densities; for suitably restricted test functions the main terms agree with random matrix theory. In particular, all one-parameter families of elliptic curves with rank r over Q(T) and the same distribution of signs of functional equations have the same limiting behavior. We break this universality and find family dependent lower order correction terms in many cases; these lower order terms have applications ranging from excess rank to modeling the behavior of zeros near the central point, and depend on the arithmetic of the family. We derive an alternate form of the explicit formula for GL(2) L-functions which simplifies comparisons, replacing sums over powers of Satake parameters by sums of the moments of the Fourier coefficients lambda_f(p). Our formula highlights the differences that we expect to exist from families whose Fourier coefficients obey different laws (for example, we expect Sato-Tate to hold only for non-CM families of elliptic curves). Further, by the work of Rosen and Silverman we expect lower order biases to the Fourier coefficients in families of elliptic curves with rank over Q(T); these biases can be seen in our expansions. We analyze several families of elliptic curves and see different lower order corrections, depending on whether or not the family has complex multiplication, a forced torsion point, or non-zero rank over Q(T).

We present in detail a systematic expansion of the relevant magnetic RIXS cross section by using the ultrashort core-hole lifetime (UCL) approximation. We compute the scattering intensity and its momentum dependence in leading order of the UCL expansion. The scattering is due to two-magnon processes and is calculated within a linear spin-wave expansion of the Heisenberg spin model for this compound, including longer range and cyclic spin interactions. We observe that the latter terms in the Hamiltonian enhance the first moment of the spectrum if they strengthen the antiferromagnetic ordering. The theoretical spectra agree very well with experimental data, including the observation that scattering intensity vanishes for the transferred momenta ${\\bf q} = (0,0)$ and ${\\bf q} = (\\pi,\\pi)$. We show that at finite temperature there is an additional single-magnon contribution to the scattering with a spectral weight proportional to $T^3$. We also compute the leading corrections to the UCL approximation and find them to be small, putting the UCL results on a solid basis. All this univocally points to the conclusion that the observed low temperature RIXS intensity in La$_2$CuO$_4$ is due to two-magnon scattering.
